    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a well-defined quantity determined by the structure of the group's Weyl group.\n\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are classified up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy by the $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$. An $F$-conjugacy class is an equivalence class for the relation $w' \\sim w$ if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w' = x^{-1}wF(x)$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any such group is \"split\" over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. Consequently, the notion of $F$-conjugacy simplifies to the standard notion of conjugacy in the Weyl group, where $w'$ is conjugate to $w$ if $w' = x^{-1}wx$ for some $x \\in W$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. This number is a fixed integer, independent of the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. According to the work of R. Carter, who classified the conjugacy classes of exceptional Weyl groups, the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has exactly 112 conjugacy classes.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
