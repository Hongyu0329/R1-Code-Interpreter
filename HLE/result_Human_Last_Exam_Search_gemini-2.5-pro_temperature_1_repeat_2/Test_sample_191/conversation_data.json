    "**The protein that, when broken down or inhibited, allows for increased macrophage engulfment of amyloid is Glia Maturation Factor-γ (GMFG).**\n\nRecent studies have identified GMFG, an actin-disassembly protein found in immune cells, as a key regulator of amyloid-beta (Aβ) phagocytosis. Research has shown that reducing the levels of GMFG, a process known as knockdown, leads to a significant increase in the ability of macrophages to engulf Aβ42. Conversely, overexpressing GMFG reduces the uptake of Aβ42 by these immune cells.\n\nThe mechanism behind this is linked to another protein, the type I class A scavenger receptor (SR-AI), which is located on the surface of macrophages and is involved in clearing Aβ. The breakdown of GMFG results in an increased expression of the SR-AI receptor. This increase in SR-AI enhances the macrophage's ability to bind to and engulf amyloid-beta. Therefore, the inhibition of GMFG presents a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing the clearance of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n<<<Glia Maturation Factor-γ (GMFG)>>>"
