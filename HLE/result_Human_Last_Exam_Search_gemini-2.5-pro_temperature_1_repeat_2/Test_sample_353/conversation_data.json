    "The stability of the BDFk methods is analyzed by considering the region of absolute stability in the complex plane. This region is defined by the set of $z = h\\lambda$ for which the characteristic polynomial $\\rho(\\zeta) - z\\sigma(\\zeta)$ has all its roots inside or on the unit circle (with roots on the circle being simple). For BDF methods, the stability polynomial is given by $\\rho(\\zeta) = \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{1}{j}\\zeta^{k-j}(\\zeta-1)^j$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta) = \\zeta^k$.\n\nThe boundary of the stability region is traced by the function $d(\\zeta) = \\rho(\\zeta)/\\sigma(\\zeta)$ for $\\zeta = e^{i\\phi}$ with $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The stability region is the exterior of the curve traced by $d(\\zeta)$.\n\nA method is said to be A($\\alpha$)-stable if its region of absolute stability contains the angular sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha, z \\ne 0\\}$. The largest such angle $\\alpha$ is the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle. This angle is determined by the tangent from the origin to the boundary of the stability region.\n\nFor the BDF4 method ($k=4$), the exact angle of A($\\alpha$)-stability, denoted $\\vartheta_4$, was determined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis. They found that the tangent of this angle is an algebraic number.\n\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{f_4(\\tilde{x}_4)-1}\\right)$\n\nHere, $\\tilde{x}_4$ is the unique root of the cubic polynomial $g_4(x)$ that lies in the interval $[-1, 1]$:\n$g_4(x) = 24x^3 + 48x^2 - 6x - 17 = 0$\n\nThe function $f_4(x)$ is a rational function defined as:\n$f_4(x) = \\frac{4(1-x)^3(6x^2-10x+5)^2}{(24x^4-72x^3+62x^2-2x-7)^2(1+x)}$\n\nThe numerical value of the angle is approximately $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{f_4(\\tilde{x}_4)-1}\\right)$, where $\\tilde{x}_4$ is the unique root in $[-1,1]$ of the polynomial $g_4(x) = 24x^3+48x^2-6x-17=0$, and $f_4(x) = \\frac{4(1-x)^3(6x^2-10x+5)^2}{(24x^4-72x^3+62x^2-2x-7)^2(1+x)}$.>>>"
