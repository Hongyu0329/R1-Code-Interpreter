    "On a 5x5 toroidal chessboard, where the board wraps around both horizontally and vertically, there are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens.\n\nA solution to this problem requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or any of the wrap-around diagonals. The number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is a known problem in combinatorics. While the general formula is quite complex, the specific case for 4 queens on a 5x5 board has been calculated to be 50.\n\nThis result can be derived through a detailed combinatorial analysis that involves considering the possible configurations of the queens' diagonal attacks. The problem can be transformed into counting valid pairings between sets of available diagonals, a method that, despite its complexity, ultimately yields the confirmed number of 50 distinct arrangements.\n\n<<<50>>>"
