    "I am unable to determine the exact number of pas de Balanchine performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo scene of the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nA video of Svetlana Gileva performing the solo on November 9, 2015, was previously available on the Semperoper Ballett's official YouTube channel, but the video is no longer accessible. Without a visual record of the performance, it is impossible to count the specific number of times a particular ballet step, such as the \"pas de Balanchine,\" was executed.\n\nReviews and articles about the Semperoper Ballett's performances of William Forsythe's work praise Svetlana Gileva's interpretation of the role but do not provide a detailed choreographic breakdown of the solo. Similarly, general analyses of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" discuss its style and deconstruction of classical ballet but do not enumerate specific steps. The \"pas de Balanchine\" is a recognized step within the ballet vocabulary, however, its use in this specific contemporary choreography is not documented in available public records.\n\nTherefore, a precise count cannot be provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number as the information is not available in any public documentation or accessible video recordings.>>>"
