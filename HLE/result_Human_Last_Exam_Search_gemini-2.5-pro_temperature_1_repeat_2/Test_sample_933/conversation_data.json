    "The most common and efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. This direct synthesis is typically carried out in a nickel container at a temperature of approximately 400°C. The nickel vessel is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel fluoride on its surface, preventing corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nThe synthesis of XeF₄ is part of a chemical equilibrium with other xenon fluorides, namely xenon difluoride (XeF₂) and xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Lower temperatures and a lower concentration of fluorine favor the formation of XeF₂, while higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor XeF₆. The conditions for producing XeF₄, specifically a 1:5 molar ratio of xenon to fluorine at 400°C, are considered optimal for a good yield of the desired product. A patent for this process indicates a temperature range between 350°C and 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature, resulting in a 100% yield with respect to the initial amount of xenon.\n\nOther methods for synthesizing xenon fluorides exist, such as using an electric discharge or UV irradiation, which can be performed at much lower temperatures. For instance, an electric discharge method can produce a mixture of xenon fluorides at temperatures between -80°C and 0°C. However, these methods are generally noted for having low productivity and yielding a mixture of products that requires further separation, making them less efficient for producing pure XeF₄. A solvothermal fluorination method has also been developed, demonstrating the preparation of an oxyfluoride at 100°C. Additionally, a Russian patent describes a combustion-based synthesis where the reactor wall is heated to 70-80°C, but this requires an initiator heated to 650-700°C to start the reaction.\n\nConsidering the efficiency and yield, the direct thermal reaction is the superior method. Therefore, 400°C is the most widely recognized and efficient temperature for the production of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
