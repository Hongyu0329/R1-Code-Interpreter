    "Zero ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules will be released during glycolysis.\n\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This process consists of ten reactions, none of which involve the removal of a carbon atom to produce carbon dioxide (a process called decarboxylation). The six carbon atoms from the initial glucose molecule are all present in the two resulting three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n\nThe release of CO₂ occurs in subsequent metabolic pathways:\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (the Link Reaction):** Following glycolysis, pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA. In this step, one carbon atom from each pyruvate molecule is released as CO₂.\n*   **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle):** The remaining two carbons from each pyruvate (in the form of acetyl-CoA) enter this cycle, where they are eventually released as CO₂.\n\nTracing the labeled carbons from 1,4-¹³C glucose shows that one of the resulting pyruvate molecules would be labeled at the C1 position (the carboxyl group), and the other would be labeled at the C3 position (the methyl group). The pyruvate labeled at C1 would release a molecule of ¹³CO₂ during pyruvate decarboxylation, but this process is separate from and occurs after glycolysis.\n\n<<<0>>>"
