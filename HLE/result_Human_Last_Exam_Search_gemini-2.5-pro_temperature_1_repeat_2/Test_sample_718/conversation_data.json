    "An upper semilattice $J$ is a partially ordered set where for any two elements, their least upper bound (or join) exists. A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is considered \"tame\" if its behavior is determined by its values on a finite subposet of $J$. Specifically, a functor is tame if it is the left Kan extension of a functor defined on a finite subposet.\n\nIn the context of homological algebra for functor categories, a functor is called **n-resolvable** if it admits a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence of the form:\n$0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\nwhere each $P_i$ is a projective functor.\n\nFor a tame functor defined on an upper semilattice $J$, the category of such functors, denoted $\\text{tame}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, has strong structural properties. It is an abelian category where every object has a minimal free resolution. Furthermore, it has been shown that for a 1-parameter persistence module (where $J = \\mathbb{R}$), which is a key example of a tame functor, the projective dimension of any such module is at most 1. This property extends to tame functors on more general posets that admit certain desirable features called \"transfers,\" a condition met by upper semilattices.\n\nA projective dimension of at most 1 means that any such functor is the cokernel of a morphism between two projective functors. In other words, for any tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, there exists a short exact sequence:\n$0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\nwhere $P_0$ and $P_1$ are projective functors. This corresponds to a projective resolution of length 1.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
