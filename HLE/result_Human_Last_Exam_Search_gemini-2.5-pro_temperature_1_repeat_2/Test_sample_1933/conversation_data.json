    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of VC dimension and the logical fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Logical Fragment\n\nThe notation $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ defines a fragment of First-Order Logic (FO). Let's break it down:\n*   **S**: This is the schema, which consists of the non-logical symbols. We are given that $S$ contains 4 unary predicates. Let's name them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate is a property that an element of the domain can have.\n*   **$\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}$**: This specifies the allowed logical symbols.\n    *   $\\exists$: Only existential quantifiers are permitted.\n    *   $\\land$: Only conjunction (AND) is allowed as a logical connective.\n    *   $\\top, \\bot$: The logical constants for TRUE and FALSE are available.\n\nA formula in this language with one free variable, say $x$, defines a \"concept\", which is the set of elements in a given structure that satisfy the formula. The VC dimension measures the complexity of the class of all concepts definable in this language.\n\nA general formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment looks like $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since all predicates in $S$ are unary, an atomic formula is of the form $P_i(z)$, where $z$ is one of the variables $\\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_m\\}$.\n\nWe can separate the conjuncts in $\\psi$ into those that involve the free variable $x$ and those that do not:\n$\\psi(x, \\vec{y}) = \\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists \\vec{y} \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y}))$\n\nThe subformula $\\exists \\vec{y} \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$ is a sentence (it has no free variables). For any given logical structure (i.e., a domain and an interpretation of the predicates), this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If $\\exists \\vec{y} \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$ is false, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (FALSE for all $x$).\n*   If $\\exists \\vec{y} \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$ is true, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\psi_x(x)$.\n\nThe term $\\psi_x(x)$ is a conjunction of the predicates applied to $x$, for instance, $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n\nTherefore, any concept definable in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is either the empty set (defined by $\\bot$) or is defined by a formula that is a simple conjunction of some subset of the available unary predicates applied to $x$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P} = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. The set of concepts is defined by formulas equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{P \\in \\mathcal{P'} } P(x)$ for all possible subsets $\\mathcal{P'} \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}$. This includes the empty conjunction (when $\\mathcal{P'} = \\emptyset$), which is equivalent to $\\top$ and defines the set of all elements in the domain.\n\nSo, the class of concepts, let's call it $\\mathcal{C}$, consists of sets of elements that satisfy conjunctions of the 4 unary predicates.\n\n### 2. Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a concept class is the maximum size of a set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the class. A set $A$ is shattered if for every subset $B \\subseteq A$, there is a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $A \\cap C = B$.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nFor any given structure, there are 4 predicates. The number of possible conjunctions of these predicates is $2^4 = 16$ (one for each subset of the four predicates). These 16 conjunctions, plus the concept for $\\bot$, result in at most $17$ distinct concepts.\n\nFor a set $A$ of size $d$ to be shattered, we must be able to form all $2^d$ of its subsets. This requires at least $2^d$ distinct concepts. Therefore, we must have:\n$2^d \\le 17$\n$d \\le \\log_2(17)$\n\nSince $d$ must be an integer, this implies $d \\le 4$. Thus, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is at most 4.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we need to demonstrate that there exists a set of 4 elements that can be shattered. Let's construct such a set and a corresponding structure.\n\nLet the set be $A = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. We need to define the interpretation of the four predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ on the elements of $A$ in such a way that any subset of $A$ can be formed by a conjunctive concept.\n\nConsider the following interpretation, where $P_i(a_j)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$:\n\n|       | $P_1$ | $P_2$ | $P_3$ | $P_4$ |\n| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $a_1$ | False | True  | True  | True  |\n| $a_2$ | True  | False | True  | True  |\n| $a_3$ | True  | True  | False | True  |\n| $a_4$ | True  | True  | True  | False |\n\nLet's show that any subset $B \\subseteq A$ can be isolated. Let $B = \\{a_{j_1}, \\dots, a_{j_k}\\}$. We need to find a concept, which is a conjunction of predicates, that is true for all elements in $B$ and false for all elements in $A \\setminus B$.\n\nConsider the concept $C_B$ defined by the conjunction of predicates $P_i$ for all indices $i$ such that $a_i \\notin B$.\n$C_B(x) := \\bigwedge_{\\{i \\mid a_i \\notin B\\}} P_i(x)$\n\nLet's test this:\n1.  Take an element $a_j \\in B$. Is $C_B(a_j)$ true?\n    The formula is $\\bigwedge_{\\{i \\mid a_i \\notin B\\}} P_i(a_j)$. By our construction, $P_i(a_j)$ is true if $i \\neq j$. Since $a_j \\in B$, its index $j$ is not in the set $\\{i \\mid a_i \\notin B\\}$. Thus, for all $i$ in the conjunction, $i \\neq j$, which means $P_i(a_j)$ is true for all of them. The whole conjunction is true.\n\n2.  Take an element $a_k \\in A \\setminus B$. Is $C_B(a_k)$ false?\n    The formula is $\\bigwedge_{\\{i \\mid a_i \\notin B\\}} P_i(x)$. We need to find one predicate in this conjunction that is false for $a_k$. Since $a_k \\notin B$, the index $k$ is part of the set $\\{i \\mid a_i \\notin B\\}$. So, the predicate $P_k(x)$ is in the conjunction. By our construction, $P_k(a_k)$ is false. Therefore, the entire conjunction is false.\n\nThis construction works for any subset $B \\subseteq A$. For example, to isolate $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$, the corresponding concept is $P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$.\n*   For $a_1$: $P_2(a_1) \\land P_4(a_1)$ is True $\\land$ True = True.\n*   For $a_3$: $P_2(a_3) \\land P_4(a_3)$ is True $\\land$ True = True.\n*   For $a_2$: $P_2(a_2) \\land P_4(a_2)$ is False $\\land$ True = False.\n*   For $a_4$: $P_2(a_4) \\land P_4(a_4)$ is True $\\land$ False = False.\nThe resulting set is indeed $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$.\n\nSince we have constructed a set of size 4 that can be shattered, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe VC dimension is at most 4 and at least 4. Therefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ for a schema $S$ with 4 unary predicates is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
