    "The problem asks for the largest number $c$ such that there exists a subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$, where the sumset $A+A = \\{a+b \\mid a,b \\in A\\}$ contains no square numbers.\n\nA simple and effective method to construct such a set $A$ is to use modular arithmetic. Consider the residues of numbers modulo 3. The square numbers can only have certain residues modulo 3. Specifically, for any integer $k$:\n*   If $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n*   If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n*   If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $k^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nThis means that any perfect square is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 3. No square number can be congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n\nThis property can be exploited by constructing a set $A$ where all sums of pairs of its elements are congruent to 2 modulo 3. Let's define the set $A$ as all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3:\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\}$\n\nIf we take any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, they can be written as $a_1 = 3k_1 + 1$ and $a_2 = 3k_2 + 1$ for some integers $k_1, k_2$. Their sum is:\n$a_1 + a_2 = (3k_1 + 1) + (3k_2 + 1) = 3(k_1 + k_2) + 2$\n\nThe sum $a_1+a_2$ is always congruent to 2 modulo 3. Since no square number is congruent to 2 modulo 3, the sumset $A+A$ cannot contain any squares. This holds whether $a_1$ and $a_2$ are distinct or identical.\n\nThe size of this set $A$ is approximately $N/3$. More precisely, $|A| = \\lfloor \\frac{N-1}{3} \\rfloor + 1$ if $N \\ge 1$, which means $|A| = \\frac{N}{3} + O(1)$. The density of $A$ in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ is $|A|/N = \\frac{1}{3} + O(\\frac{1}{N})$. As $N \\to \\infty$, this density approaches $1/3$. This construction demonstrates that a set with $c=1/3$ is possible, so $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nTo determine if a larger value for $c$ is possible, one must consider upper bounds. It has been proven that if a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ has the property that $A+A$ contains no squares, its size is bounded by $|A| \\le N/3 + O(\\sqrt{N/\\log N})$. This result establishes that the density cannot exceed $1/3$. The argument relies on decomposing the set $A$ based on its residues modulo 3 and applying deep results from additive number theory, such as variants of Sárközy's theorem, to the parts of the set that would produce sums congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. These theorems show that such parts of the set must be very small, forcing the bulk of the set to be in the residue class $1 \\pmod 3$ (or $2 \\pmod 3$, which has a similar effect).\n\nTherefore, the construction based on the residue class $1 \\pmod 3$ is essentially the best possible. The largest possible value for the constant $c$ is $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
