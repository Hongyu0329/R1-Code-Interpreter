    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to determine the value of \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\nThe generalized Markov numbers, in the context of the notation \\( m_{p/q} \\), are typically those related to a specific generalization of the Markov equation derived from the study of cluster algebras and snake graphs. The governing equation for these numbers is \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz\\).\n\nThe computation of the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is intrinsically linked to the continued fraction of the rational number \\( p/q \\). The procedure is as follows:\n1.  Determine the simple continued fraction of \\( p/q \\).\n2.  This continued fraction's coefficients are used to construct a \"snake graph\".\n3.  The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is equal to the number of perfect matchings of this snake graph.\n\nThe number of perfect matchings of a snake graph \\(G[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\) is given by the numerator of the continued fraction \\([a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\). This value is calculated using a mathematical entity known as a continuant polynomial.\n\nLet's apply this procedure for \\( m_{4/7} \\):\n\n**Step 1: Find the continued fraction of 4/7.**\nThe Euclidean algorithm for 4 and 7 gives:\n\\begin{align*} 7 &= 1 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\\\ 4 &= 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\\\ 3 &= 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\end{align*}\nThis gives the continued fraction for 7/4 as \\([1; 1, 3]\\).\nTherefore, the continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The coefficients are \\(a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 3\\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).**\nThe number \\( m_{4/7} \\) corresponds to the number of perfect matchings of the snake graph \\(G\\). This value is the numerator of the continued fraction \\([1; 1, 3]\\).\nLet's compute the value of \\([1; 1, 3]\\):\n$$ [1; 1, 3] = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} $$\nThe numerator is 7. So, \\( m_{4/7} = 7 \\).\n\nAlternatively, the number of perfect matchings is the denominator of the original continued fraction \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The convergents of \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\) are:\n*   \\( \\frac{1}{1} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{3 \\cdot 1 + 1}{3 \\cdot 2 + 1} = \\frac{4}{7} \\)\nThe denominator is 7. Thus, the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is 7.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the continued fraction of \\( m_{4/7} \\).**\nThe number is 7. The continued fraction of any integer \\( n \\) is simply \\([n]\\).\nTherefore, the continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\) is \\(\\).\n\n<<<>>>"
