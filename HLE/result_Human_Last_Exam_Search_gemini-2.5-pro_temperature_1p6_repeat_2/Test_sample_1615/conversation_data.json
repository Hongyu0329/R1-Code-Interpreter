    "Let $n=12345$ be the number of vertices of the graph $G$. We are given that $G$ is not a complete graph. We want to find the maximum possible value for the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$.\n\n### Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nA well-known result in graph theory states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n$. However, since $G$ is not a complete graph, there must be at least one pair of vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge.\n\nThis means that the independence number of the graph, $\\alpha(G)$ (which is the size of the largest set of vertices where no two vertices are adjacent), is at least 2.\n\nA general upper bound for the chromatic number is given by the inequality $\\chi(G) \\le n - \\alpha(G) + 1$.\nSince $\\alpha(G) \\ge 2$, we have:\n$\\chi(G) \\le n - 2 + 1 = n - 1$.\n\nFor our graph with $n=12345$, this means the chromatic number is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Brooks's Theorem. Brooks's Theorem states that for any connected graph $G$ with maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the exceptional cases, $\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\n*   The problem explicitly states that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n*   If $G$ were an odd cycle with 12345 vertices, its maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ would be 2, and its chromatic number would be $\\Delta(G) + 1 = 3$.\n*   If $G$ is any other connected graph, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. Since a graph with $n$ vertices can have a maximum degree of at most $n-1$, we have $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le n-1 = 12344$.\n*   If $G$ is disconnected, its chromatic number is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. If we consider each component, the same logic applies, leading to the conclusion that the chromatic number of any component, and thus the entire graph, cannot exceed $n-1 = 12344$. An exception would be a component that is a complete graph on $k$ vertices, requiring $k$ colors. If a component is a $K_k$, its chromatic number is $k$, which is at most the number of vertices in that component. So the total chromatic number cannot exceed $n-1=12344$, as having a $K_{12345}$ is ruled out.\n\nSo, the maximum number of colours is at most 12344.\n\n### Existence of a Graph Requiring That Many Colours\n\nNow we need to show that this upper bound can be achieved. Let's construct a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ which is composed of two disconnected components:\n1.  A complete graph $K_{12344}$ on 12344 vertices.\n2.  An isolated vertex.\n\nThis graph $G$ has a total of $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n\nThe chromatic number of this disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n*   The chromatic number of the complete graph $K_{12344}$ is 12344.\n*   The chromatic number of an isolated vertex is 1.\n\nTherefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nThis construction demonstrates that there exists a graph with 12345 vertices, which is not a complete graph, and requires 12344 colours.\n\nSince we have shown that the number of colours is at most 12344 and that a value of 12344 is achievable, the maximum number of colours is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
