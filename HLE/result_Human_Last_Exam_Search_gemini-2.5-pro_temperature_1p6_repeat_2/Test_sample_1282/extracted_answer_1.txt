No, the solution could not blow up in finite-time. The time-dependent viscosity term $(1+t)\Delta u$ becomes stronger over time, which enhances the dissipation of energy and counteracts the nonlinear effects that could lead to a blow-up. A change of variables transforms the equation into a system where the nonlinearity decays with time, which guarantees the global existence of a smooth solution.
