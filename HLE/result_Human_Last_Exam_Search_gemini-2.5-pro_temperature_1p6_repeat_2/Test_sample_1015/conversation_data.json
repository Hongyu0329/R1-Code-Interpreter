    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière (backward bend) in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a square and strong torso and upper back. This principle dictates that the hips should remain aligned and facing forward during a cambré derrière. The movement should originate from the upper and middle back, with the hips providing a stable base.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for its speed, athleticism, and a notable arabesque with an open hip that faces the audience. This technique allows for a more dynamic and less rigid torso, and in a cambré derrière, the hip of the working leg is often allowed to open. This creates a different line and aesthetic from the Vaganova style.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement (port de bras), speed, and degree of backbend are also defining characteristics of each method, the fundamental approach to hip placement in a backward bend is a significant point of divergence. The Vaganova method prioritizes a stable, square foundation, while the Balanchine style often encourages a more open and flexible hip to achieve its signature dynamic lines.\n\n<<<B>>>"
