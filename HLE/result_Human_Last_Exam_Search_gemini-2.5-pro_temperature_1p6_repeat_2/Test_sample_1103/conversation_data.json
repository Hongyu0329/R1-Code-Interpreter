    "In the context of the Gauss class number problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a specific class number has been a long-standing question. A fundamental discriminant is an integer that is the discriminant of a quadratic number field. For negative fundamental discriminants, these correspond to imaginary quadratic fields. The class number of such a field is the order of its ideal class group, a key invariant in algebraic number theory.\n\nThe problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number has been resolved for class numbers up to 100. This was accomplished by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". Watkins' work provides a complete enumeration of these fields.\n\nBased on the tables provided in Watkins' paper, there are **243** negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48.\n\n<<<243>>>"
