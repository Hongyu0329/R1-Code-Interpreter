    "To determine the number of integer values for side length AC, we first need to establish the conditions for the existence of two possible triangles.\n\nIn triangle ABC, we are given:\n*   BC = S\n*   m∠B = 30°\n\nLet's denote the sides as a = BC, b = AC, and c = AB. The angles are A, B, and C. So, a = S and B = 30°.\n\nThe condition for the existence of two possible triangles (the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines) arises when the side opposite the given angle (AC) is shorter than the other given side (BC) but longer than the altitude from the corresponding vertex (C).\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the altitude (let's call it *h*) from vertex C to the side AB.\n*h* = a * sin(B)\n*h* = S * sin(30°)\nSince sin(30°) = 0.5, we have:\n*h* = S / 2\n\nFor two possible triangles to exist, the length of side AC (b) must be greater than the altitude *h* and less than the side BC (a).\nTherefore, the condition is:\nh < AC < BC\nS / 2 < AC < S\n\nWe need to find the number of *integer* values of AC that satisfy this inequality.\n\nThe value of S is given by SNYWR. While this is not a standard mathematical constant, it can be interpreted as the sum of the alphabetical positions of its letters (A=1, B=2, C=3, ...). This is a method sometimes used in puzzles and is related to gematria.\n*   S = 19\n*   N = 14\n*   Y = 25\n*   W = 23\n*   R = 18\n\nSumming these values:\nS = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99\n\nNow, we substitute this value of S into our inequality:\n99 / 2 < AC < 99\n49.5 < AC < 99\n\nSince AC must be an integer, the possible values for AC are all the integers from 50 to 98, inclusive.\nTo find the number of these integer values, we can calculate:\nNumber of values = (Last integer) - (First integer) + 1\nNumber of values = 98 - 50 + 1 = 49\n\nThus, there are 49 possible integer values for the side length AC.\n\n<<<49>>>"
