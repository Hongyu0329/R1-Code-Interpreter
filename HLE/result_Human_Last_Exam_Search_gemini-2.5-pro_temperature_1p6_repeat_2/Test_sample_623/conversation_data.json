    "The question asks about the number of ¹³CO₂ molecules released when 1,4-¹³C glucose goes through glycolysis.\n\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) into two molecules of pyruvate (3-carbon molecules). The overall reaction for glycolysis shows that the six carbon atoms of glucose are conserved in the two pyruvate molecules. The process does not involve the loss of any carbon atoms. Therefore, no carbon dioxide (CO₂) is produced during the glycolytic pathway itself.\n\nSince no CO₂ is produced during glycolysis, no ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules can be released.\n\nIt is important to note that CO₂ is released in subsequent stages of cellular respiration. For example, in the link reaction (pyruvate decarboxylation), which connects glycolysis to the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, and one molecule of CO₂ is released per pyruvate. Furthermore, the remaining carbons are released as CO₂ during the Krebs cycle. However, the question specifically refers only to the process of glycolysis.\n\n<<<0>>>"
