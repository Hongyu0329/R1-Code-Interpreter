    "Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, weaves a narrative rich with geographical references, both real and mythological. Among the numerous rivers mentioned, three stand out for their considerable lengths: the Don, the Rhine, and the Tagus.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Don River**, known in antiquity as the Tanais. It flows for approximately 1,870 kilometers (1,162 miles) from its source in central Russia to the Sea of Azov. The Tanais is mentioned in Book XII of the *Aeneid*.\n\nThe second longest is the **Rhine River**, which the Romans called Rhenus. Stretching for about 1,230 kilometers (765 miles), it is a major European waterway. Virgil includes the Rhine in Book VIII, referring to it as \"double-horned\" (\"bicornis\"), likely a reference to its two main branches at its delta.\n\nThe third longest river in this context is the **Tagus River**, with a length of 1,007 kilometers (626 miles). This river, which flows through both Spain and Portugal, is mentioned in Book IX of the *Aeneid* in the episode involving the Trojan youths Nisus and Euryalus, where a character named Tagus is also present.\n\nWhile the *Aeneid* also features other significant real-world rivers like the Tiber, the central river in the latter half of the epic, and the Orontes in Syria, their lengths are less than the aforementioned three. The epic also famously includes the mythological rivers of the underworld, such as the Styx and Acheron, which, due to their mythical nature, do not have a measurable length.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid are the Don (1,870 km), the Rhine (1,230 km), and the Tagus (1,007 km).>>>"
