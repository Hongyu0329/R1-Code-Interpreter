    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to describing changes in the laws of nature, including both the virgin birth of Jesus and alterations at the Fall, was Augustine of Hippo.\n\nAugustine developed the concept of ***rationes seminales***, which can be translated as \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles.\" This was a highly influential theological and philosophical framework for understanding God's creation and action in the world.\n\nAccording to Augustine, God embedded these \"seed-like\" principles into creation at the very beginning. This terminology explains a range of natural phenomena:\n\n*   **Natural Laws:** The regular, predictable course of nature is the unfolding of these seminal reasons according to their normal operation. All things that come into being over time derive their growth and form from these principles established at creation.\n*   **Miracles and the Virgin Birth:** Miracles are not violations of nature's order but the activation by God of other, hidden potentialities within the *rationes seminales*. Augustine argued that God placed within creation not only the capacity for usual development but also a \"passive capacity for unusual modes of operation.\" The virgin birth can be understood within this framework as a unique, miraculous event where God brought about a conception without the normal process of human procreation, thereby bypassing the transmission of original sin which Augustine linked to carnal concupiscence. Augustine stated that the Holy Spirit infused an \"immaculate seed\" into Mary's womb.\n*   **The Fall:** The concept also accounts for changes in natural laws or conditions after the Fall of Man. Augustine believed God could have anticipated the Fall and embedded potentials within the *rationes seminales* to account for its consequences. He taught that all of humanity was \"seminally present in the loins of Adam,\" and thus when Adam's nature became corrupted by sin, that corruption was passed to all subsequent generations through this seminal principle. This provides a mechanism for a fundamental alteration in the state of human nature.\n\nTherefore, Augustine's doctrine of *rationes seminales* provided a unified and sophisticated terminology to describe how the natural world operates and how it can be altered, applying both to the specific miracle of the virgin birth and the universal changes brought about by the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
