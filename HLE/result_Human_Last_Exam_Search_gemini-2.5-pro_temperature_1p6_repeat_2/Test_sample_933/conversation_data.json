    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly and efficiently synthesized by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases. This reaction is typically conducted in a nickel container at an elevated temperature.\n\nThe original and most frequently cited method for producing XeF₄ involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine to 400°C. This process yields a colorless crystalline solid that sublimes at 117°C. The nickel container is used not as a catalyst, but to form a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface, which prevents corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nWhile the optimal temperature is widely reported as 400°C, the viable temperature range for this thermal synthesis is generally between 350°C and 450°C. Flow methods have also been employed, with reaction temperatures ranging from 300°C to 500°C, though these can sometimes lead to contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF₂). For the thermal method, the reaction rate only becomes rapid above 250°C.\n\nOther synthesis methods exist that can be conducted at lower ambient temperatures. For instance, using an electric discharge or photochemical methods (UV or gamma radiation) can initiate the reaction. A Russian patent describes a glow discharge method where the reaction vessel is cooled to between -80°C and 0°C; however, this method is noted to have low productivity and results in a mixture of xenon fluorides. The key distinction is that these methods use an external energy source other than thermal heat to drive the reaction, and they are not always the most efficient for producing pure XeF₄.\n\nConsidering the efficiency of the production, the direct thermal synthesis remains the most reliable. Although a flow method has been reported to produce a quantitative yield at 300°C, 400°C is the most consistently documented temperature for efficient, high-yield synthesis in a static system. Therefore, among the given choices, 400°C is the coldest temperature at which xenon tetrafluoride can be produced with high efficiency using a well-established method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
