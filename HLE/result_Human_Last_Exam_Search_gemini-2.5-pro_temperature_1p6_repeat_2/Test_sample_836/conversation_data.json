    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** or, in the case of correlations between two different signals, the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**.\n\nFundamentally, in the broader field of condensed matter physics and neutron scattering, this transformed function is known as the **dynamic structure factor**, S(k,ω), where k is the wavevector (related to the spatial Fourier transform) and ω is the angular frequency (related to the temporal Fourier transform). The dynamic structure factor contains information about the correlations between particles in both space and time. It is directly related to the double differential scattering cross-section in inelastic neutron scattering experiments.\n\nWithin the more specialized field of nuclear criticality and reactor noise analysis, the focus is often on the fluctuations of the neutron population around its steady-state value, referred to as \"neutron noise\". The analysis of these fluctuations is a key diagnostic tool for determining reactor parameters and monitoring core stability. The temporal Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of these neutron fluctuations is the Power Spectral Density, a concept central to neutron noise analysis. This relationship is an application of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem.\n\nTherefore, while \"dynamic structure factor\" is the more general and formal term, the working terminology within the nuclear criticality community for the analysis of neutron fluctuations in the frequency domain is overwhelmingly \"Power Spectral Density\".\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density (PSD)"
