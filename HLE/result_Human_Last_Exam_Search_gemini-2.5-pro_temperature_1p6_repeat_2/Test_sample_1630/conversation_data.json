    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of $h(x)$, which are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n1.  **Determine the nature of the functions.**\n    *   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are given as polynomials of degree 3.\n    *   The derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are quadratic polynomials.\n    *   The condition that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$ implies that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. This is because a positive derivative indicates a function is always increasing. For a quadratic polynomial $ax^2+bx+c$ to be always positive, its leading coefficient $a$ must be positive and its discriminant must be negative.\n\n2.  **Analyze the composite function.**\n    *   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is created by substituting one degree 3 polynomial into another. The degree of the resulting polynomial $h(x)$ is the product of their degrees, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   The equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) = x$, is therefore a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n    *   According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Thus, the function $h(x)$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n3.  **Investigate if 9 fixed points are achievable.**\n    To determine the maximum possible number of roots, we can analyze the derivative of the function whose roots we are seeking. Let's define a new function $k(x) = h(x) - x$. The roots of $k(x)$ correspond to the fixed points of $h(x)$.\n\n    According to Rolle's Theorem, between any two distinct real roots of a differentiable function, there must be at least one real root of its derivative. This implies that if the derivative $k'(x)$ has at most $m$ real roots, then the function $k(x)$ can have at most $m+1$ real roots.\n\n    Let's find the derivative of $k(x)$:\n    $k'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n\n    Now we need to determine the degree of the polynomial $k'(x)$:\n    *   Since $f(x)$ has a degree of 3, its derivative $f'(x)$ has a degree of 2.\n    *   Since $g(x)$ has a degree of 3, its derivative $g'(x)$ has a degree of 2.\n    *   The term $f'(g(x))$ involves substituting a degree 3 polynomial ($g(x)$) into a degree 2 polynomial ($f'(x)$). The resulting polynomial has a degree of $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   The product $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\n    So, $k'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A degree 8 polynomial can have at most 8 real roots.\n\n    Since $k'(x)$ can have at most 8 real roots, by Rolle's Theorem, $k(x)$ can have at most $8 + 1 = 9$ real roots. This confirms that the maximum number of fixed points cannot exceed 9.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    We have established that the number of fixed points is at most 9. It is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which the equation $f(g(x))=x$ has 9 real solutions. This would require the 8th-degree polynomial $k'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ to have 8 distinct real roots, which is possible by carefully choosing the coefficients of the polynomials. This would create a function $k(x)$ with 8 \"wiggles\", and by adjusting the constant term, it can be made to cross the x-axis 9 times. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
