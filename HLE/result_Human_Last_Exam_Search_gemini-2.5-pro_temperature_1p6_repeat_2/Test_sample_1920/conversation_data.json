    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order 6, we can decompose such a character into a product of a primitive character of order 2 and one of order 3.\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a Dirichlet character of order 6. Then $\\chi$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_2 \\chi_3$, where $\\chi_2$ is a character of order 2 and $\\chi_3$ is a character of order 3. For $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d$, both $\\chi_2$ and $\\chi_3$ must be primitive characters, and their conductors must be coprime. Let $d_2$ be the conductor of $\\chi_2$ and $d_3$ be the conductor of $\\chi_3$. Then $d = d_2 d_3$ and since $d$ is square-free, we have $\\gcd(d_2, d_3) = 1$.\n\nOur task breaks down into these steps:\n1.  Find the prime factorization of $d=53599$.\n2.  Identify the conditions on $d_2$ and $d_3$ to be conductors of primitive characters of order 2 and 3, respectively.\n3.  Count the number of ways to partition the prime factors of $d$ into sets for $d_2$ and $d_3$ that satisfy these conditions.\n4.  For each valid partition $(d_2, d_3)$, determine the number of corresponding primitive characters.\n5.  Sum the counts for all valid partitions.\n\n**Step 1: Prime factorization of d**\nFirst, we find the prime factors of $d=53599$.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe number $d$ is a product of four distinct prime numbers, so it is square-free.\n\n**Step 2: Conditions for conductors**\n*   **Conductor of a primitive character of order 2 ($\\chi_2$)**: A primitive character of order 2 is a real character associated with a fundamental discriminant $D$. Its conductor is $|D|$. Since $d$ is odd, its factor $d_2$ must be odd. For an odd square-free integer $k>1$ to be a fundamental discriminant, it must satisfy $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Thus, $d_2$ must be a product of prime factors of $d$ such that $d_2 > 1$ and $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. For each such $d_2$, there is exactly one primitive character of order 2, given by the Jacobi symbol $\\chi_{d_2}(n) = (\\frac{d_2}{n})$.\n\n*   **Conductor of a primitive character of order 3 ($\\chi_3$)**: A primitive character of order 3 can have a conductor $d_3$ if $d_3$ is of the form $q_1 \\dots q_k$ or $9q_1 \\dots q_k$, where each $q_i$ is a distinct prime satisfying $q_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. As $d$ is square-free, $d_3$ must be a product of distinct primes all congruent to $1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nLet's check our prime factors:\n*   $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n*   $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n*   $19 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $19 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n*   $31 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $31 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nAll prime factors of $d$ are congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$. Therefore, any divisor $d_3 > 1$ of $d$ is a valid conductor for a primitive character of order 3. The number of primitive characters of order 3 for a conductor $d_3 = q_1 \\dots q_k$ (where $q_i$ are distinct primes $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$) is $2^k = 2^{\\omega(d_3)}$, where $\\omega(n)$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $n$.\n\n**Step 3: Finding valid partitions of prime factors**\nWe need to partition the set of prime factors $P = \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$ into two subsets, $P_2$ for $d_2$ and $P_3$ for $d_3$. The condition on $d_3$ is always met as long as $d_3 > 1$. The main constraint is $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. A product of these primes is congruent to $1 \\pmod{4}$ if and only if it contains an even number of primes that are congruent to $3 \\pmod{4}$. The primes in $P$ congruent to $3 \\pmod{4}$ are $S_3 = \\{7, 19, 31\\}$. The prime congruent to $1 \\pmod{4}$ is $S_1 = \\{13\\}$.\n\nWe enumerate the possible sets $P_2$ such that $d_2 = \\prod_{p \\in P_2} p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and $d_2 > 1$:\n1.  $P_2$ contains zero primes from $S_3$. Since $d_2>1$, $P_2$ must contain a prime, so $P_2 = \\{13\\}$. Here $d_2=13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. This is a valid choice.\n2.  $P_2$ contains two primes from $S_3$. The choices for these two primes are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$. They are $\\{7, 19\\}$, $\\{7, 31\\}$, and $\\{19, 31\\}$.\n    *   With no prime from $S_1$, we get the sets: $\\{7, 19\\}$, $\\{7, 31\\}$, $\\{19, 31\\}$. All these products are $\\equiv 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. These are valid choices.\n    *   With the prime from $S_1$, we get the sets: $\\{13, 7, 19\\}$, $\\{13, 7, 31\\}$, $\\{13, 19, 31\\}$. All these products are $\\equiv 1 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. These are valid choices.\n\nSo there are $1 + 3 + 3 = 7$ valid partitions of the prime factors. We also need to ensure $d_3 > 1$, which means $P_2$ cannot be the entire set $P$. The full product $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31 \\equiv 3 \\times 1 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, so $d_2$ can never be $d$. Thus $d_3$ is always greater than 1.\n\n**Step 4 & 5: Counting the characters for each partition**\n\nWe calculate the number of characters for each valid choice of $d_2$. The number of $\\chi_2$ characters is 1. The number of $\\chi_3$ characters is $2^{\\omega(d_3)}$.\nLet's list the cases based on the choice of $P_2$:\n\n*   **Case 1**: $P_2=\\{13\\}$.\n    $d_2 = 13$. $d_3 = 7 \\times 19 \\times 31$. $\\omega(d_3) = 3$.\n    Number of characters = $1 \\times 2^3 = 8$.\n\n*   **Case 2**: $P_2$ is a 2-element subset of $\\{7, 19, 31\\}$. There are 3 such sets.\n    *   $P_2=\\{7, 19\\}$. $d_2=133$. $d_3 = 13 \\times 31$. $\\omega(d_3)=2$. Number of characters = $1 \\times 2^2=4$.\n    *   $P_2=\\{7, 31\\}$. $d_2=217$. $d_3 = 13 \\times 19$. $\\omega(d_3)=2$. Number of characters = $1 \\times 2^2=4$.\n    *   $P_2=\\{19, 31\\}$. $d_2=589$. $d_3 = 7 \\times 13$. $\\omega(d_3)=2$. Number of characters = $1 \\times 2^2=4$.\n    Total for this case: $4+4+4=12$.\n\n*   **Case 3**: $P_2=\\{13\\}$ combined with a 2-element subset of $\\{7, 19, 31\\}$. There are 3 such sets.\n    *   $P_2=\\{13, 7, 19\\}$. $d_3=31$. $\\omega(d_3)=1$. Number of characters = $1 \\times 2^1=2$.\n    *   $P_2=\\{13, 7, 31\\}$. $d_3=19$. $\\omega(d_3)=1$. Number of characters = $1 \\times 2^1=2$.\n    *   $P_2=\\{13, 19, 31\\}$. $d_3=7$. $\\omega(d_3)=1$. Number of characters = $1 \\times 2^1=2$.\n    Total for this case: $2+2+2=6$.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the sum of the numbers from all cases:\nTotal = $8 + 12 + 6 = 26$.\n\n"
