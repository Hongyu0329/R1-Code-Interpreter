    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The two most common forms are copper(I) and copper(II) complexes, which exhibit different molecular geometries and therefore possess different point group symmetries.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)**\n\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex has a tetrahedral coordination geometry. The specific point group for this complex is **S₄**. An S₄ symmetry element is a roto-inversion axis, which involves a 90-degree rotation followed by an inversion through the center of the molecule.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)**\n\nIn the case of the copper(II) complex, the geometry is typically a distorted octahedron. The crystal structure of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) bis(tetrafluoroborate) reveals that the copper ion is coordinated to the four sulfur atoms of the two dithiahexane ligands in an equatorial plane, with two fluorine atoms from the tetrafluoroborate anions occupying the axial positions. Similarly, the perchlorate salt shows a square-planar arrangement of the four sulfur donors with perchlorate groups in the axial positions.\n\nThe molecule crystallizes in the monoclinic space group *P*2₁/*c* with two formula units (Z=2) in the unit cell. For Z=2 in this space group, the molecule must occupy a special position with a center of inversion. Therefore, the point group of the isolated bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex cation with its axially coordinated counter-ions is **Cᵢ**. This point group consists of only two symmetry operations: the identity (E) and an inversion center (i).\n\nIn summary, the point group is:\n*   **S₄** for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)\n*   **Cᵢ** for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex>>>"
