    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction.\n\n1.  **Substrate and Reagent Analysis**: The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. This combination strongly favors an E2 mechanism.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry and Conformation**: The designation (1S,2R) for adjacent carbons indicates a *cis* relationship between the bromo and methyl groups. For an E2 reaction to occur on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and a β-hydrogen must be in an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) arrangement. This means the bromine atom must occupy an axial position in the chair conformation.\n\n3.  **Reactive Conformation**:\n    *   The *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as two chair conformers in equilibrium.\n    *   The E2 reaction can only proceed from the conformer where the bromine atom is in an axial position.\n    *   When the bromine is axial (e.g., \"up\"), the *cis* methyl group on the adjacent carbon will be in an equatorial (\"up\") position. This is a relatively stable conformation.\n\n4.  **Possible Products**: In this axial-Br conformation, we must look for β-hydrogens that are anti-periplanar (i.e., also axial).\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C2**: The carbon bearing the methyl group (C2) has an axial hydrogen. Removal of this hydrogen by the base would lead to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (trisubstituted) alkene, known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C6**: The other adjacent carbon (C6) also has an axial hydrogen. Removal of this hydrogen would lead to a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (disubstituted) alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\n5.  **Product Determination**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base. Due to its large size, it experiences steric hindrance when trying to abstract a proton from a more sterically crowded location.\n    *   The axial hydrogen at C2 is shielded by the equatorial methyl group and the axial hydrogens on the ring.\n    *   The axial hydrogen at C6 is significantly more accessible to the bulky base.\n    *   Therefore, the base will preferentially remove the proton from C6. This preference for the less substituted product when using a bulky base is known as Hofmann's rule.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is the Hofmann product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
