    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous segment of DNA that can be translated into a protein. It starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Since the provided sequence is from the middle of an ORF, we should expect one of the three possible reading frames to translate into a protein sequence without any internal stop codons.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence can be read in three different frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting at the 1st nucleotide):** `gga cat tgt tgt tag...` translates to `G H C C Stop...`. This frame contains a stop codon (`tag`), so it is incorrect.\n*   **Frame 2 (starting at the 2nd nucleotide):** `gac att gtt gtt agc...` translates to a full amino acid sequence with no stop codons. This is the correct open reading frame.\n*   **Frame 3 (starting at the 3rd nucleotide):** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...` translates to `T L L L A K T Stop...`. This frame contains a stop codon (`tga`), so it is also incorrect.\n\nThe correct frame is Frame 2, which does not contain any stop codons.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVS EDL NGT VKF SSL LPY PNN LNS VLA ERL EKW\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSLLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
