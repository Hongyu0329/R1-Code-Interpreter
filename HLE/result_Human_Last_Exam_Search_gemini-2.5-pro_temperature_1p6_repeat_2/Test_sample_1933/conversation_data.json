    "Answering this question involves determining the complexity of the class of sets definable by the given first-order logic fragment. The VC dimension measures the maximum size of a set of elements that can be \"shattered\" by the formulas in the language.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Logical Language\n\nFirst, let's analyze the components of the logical language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$:\n*   **Schema $S$**: The schema consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate is a property that an element of the domain can either have or not have. For each predicate $P_i$, it defines a set of elements for which the predicate is true.\n*   **$\\mathrm{FO}$**: This indicates we are working within the framework of First-Order Logic.\n*   **Connectives and Quantifiers**: The allowed logical constructs are:\n    *   `∃`: Existential quantification.\n    *   `∧`: Conjunction (AND).\n    *   `⊤` (Top): A formula that is always true.\n    *   `⊥` (Bottom): A formula that is always false.\n    Notably, negation (`¬`), disjunction (`∨`), and universal quantification (`∀`) are not permitted.\n\n### 2. Characterizing Definable Sets\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ defines a set of elements in the domain for which the formula holds true. The VC dimension of the language is the maximum VC dimension over all such definable sets.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in this language is built from atomic formulas like $P_i(y)$ using only conjunction and existential quantification. Let's consider the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$. Any part of the formula that does not contain the free variable $x$ (e.g., $\\exists y P_j(y)$) evaluates to either true or false for the entire structure. If it's false, the whole conjunction becomes false ($\\bot$). If it's true, it behaves like $\\top$ and can be removed from the conjunction without changing the set of `x`'s that satisfy the formula.\n\nTherefore, any non-trivial formula $\\phi(x)$ is logically equivalent to a conjunction of atomic predicates applied to $x$. For instance, a complex formula like $\\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y) \\land P_3(x))$ simplifies to either $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$ (if there exists an element $y$ for which $P_2(y)$ is true) or to $\\bot$ (if no such $y$ exists).\n\nThe set of concepts (definable sets) is therefore generated by all possible conjunctions of the available predicates. With 4 predicates, the definable sets are those corresponding to formulas like:\n*   $P_1(x)$\n*   $P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$\n*   $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$\n*   $\\top$ (the empty conjunction, defining the entire domain)\n*   $\\bot$\n\nIn set-theoretic terms, if $S_i$ is the set of elements satisfying predicate $P_i$, the definable sets are all possible intersections of these four base sets: $\\bigcap_{j \\in J} S_j$ for any index set $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This corresponds to the concept class of \"monotone monomials\" over 4 variables.\n\n### 3. Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nTo find the VC dimension, we need to find the size of the largest set that can be shattered by this class of concepts.\n\n#### Lower Bound (VC dimension ≥ 4)\n\nWe can show that the VC dimension is at least 4 by constructing a model and a set of 4 elements that can be shattered.\nLet the domain of our model contain the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We define the four predicates on these elements as follows:\n$P_i(x_j)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n\nLet's see what sets the predicates define over $X$:\n*   $S_1 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_2 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_3 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_4 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nNow, we must show that for any arbitrary subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a formula (an intersection of some of the $S_i$) that selects exactly the elements of $Y$.\nLet's choose the formula based on the elements we want to *exclude* from $Y$. Let $Y^c = X \\setminus Y$ be the complement of $Y$ in $X$.\nConstruct the formula by taking the conjunction of predicates $P_k$ for each $x_k \\in Y^c$. In set terms, this is the intersection $\\bigcap_{k \\text{ s.t. } x_k \\in Y^c} S_k$.\n\nLet's test this. Suppose we want to select the subset $Y = \\{x_1, x_3\\}$. The complement is $Y^c = \\{x_2, x_4\\}$. The corresponding formula is $P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$, which defines the set $S_2 \\cap S_4$.\n$S_2 \\cap S_4 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\} \\cap \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_3\\}$. This works perfectly.\n\nLet's try to select $Y=\\{x_2\\}$. The complement is $Y^c = \\{x_1,x_3,x_4\\}$. The formula is $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$, which defines the set $S_1 \\cap S_3 \\cap S_4$.\n$S_1 \\cap S_3 \\cap S_4 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\} \\cap \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\} \\cap \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = \\{x_2\\}$. This also works.\n\nThis construction can be generalized to any subset of $X$, including the empty set (by taking the intersection of all four sets) and $X$ itself (by taking the empty intersection, which corresponds to the formula $\\top$). Since we can shatter a set of size 4, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n#### Upper Bound (VC dimension ≤ 4)\n\nTo prove an upper bound, we can use a counting argument. The number of distinct concepts (definable sets) is limited by the number of formulas we can create. As established, every definable set corresponds to a conjunction of some subset of the four predicates $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$.\nThe number of such subsets of predicates is $2^4 = 16$. This means our language can define at most 16 distinct non-empty sets, plus the empty set (defined by $\\bot$).\n\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, a concept class must be able to realize all $2^d$ possible dichotomies (labelings) of the set. To shatter a hypothetical set of 5 elements, we would need to be able to generate $2^5 = 32$ distinct subsets.\nSince our language can define at most 17 concepts (16 from predicate conjunctions + the empty set), it is impossible to generate the required 32 subsets. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\nThis implies that the VC dimension cannot be 5 or greater. So, the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we have shown that $4 \\le \\text{VC dimension} \\le 4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
