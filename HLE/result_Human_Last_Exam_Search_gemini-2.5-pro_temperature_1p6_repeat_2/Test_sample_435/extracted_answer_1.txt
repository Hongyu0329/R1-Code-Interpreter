Based on the body of evidence, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit an increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is supported by the observation of enhanced T cell effector functions and a higher incidence of cytokine release syndrome in patients treated with IL-15-modified CAR T cells.
