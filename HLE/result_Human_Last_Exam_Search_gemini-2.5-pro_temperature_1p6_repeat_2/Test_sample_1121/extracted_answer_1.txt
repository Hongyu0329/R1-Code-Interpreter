The resources required for non-Clifford gates are substantial and depend heavily on the code distance and physical error rate. For a distance-3 surface code, a magic state for a non-Clifford gate can be initially prepared using approximately 28 physical qubits. For a distance-5 surface code with a high physical error rate of 1%, implementing a universal quantum computer would be extremely challenging. The creation of a single high-fidelity logical non-Clifford gate through magic state distillation would likely require thousands of physical qubits and a very large number of gate operations, and would necessitate a code distance significantly greater than 5 to be effective.
