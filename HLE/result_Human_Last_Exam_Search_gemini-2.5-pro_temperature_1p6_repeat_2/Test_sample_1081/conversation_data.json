    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is determined by the conjugacy classes of its Weyl group.\n\nA reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a Chevalley group, and is therefore a split group. The Lang-Steinberg theorem states that for a connected linear algebraic group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G)$ is trivial. This implies that all forms of $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are isomorphic to the split form.\n\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are classified up to conjugacy by the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q})$-rational points of the variety of maximal tori. The number of these conjugacy classes is equal to the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism. For a split group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group. Consequently, the $F$-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted as $W(E_8)$. The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed. According to the work of specialists in the field, the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
