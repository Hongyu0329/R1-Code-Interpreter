    "It is not possible to determine the exact number of *pas de Balanchine* performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo scene of the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nDespite numerous searches for video documentation of this specific performance, all previously available online videos have been made inaccessible. While it has been confirmed that Svetlana Gileva performed this role during the 2015 season and that the \"Jete Woman\" solo is renowned for its dynamic jet√© entrance, a visual analysis is essential to identify and count the specific ballet steps.\n\nThe term *pas de Balanchine* refers to a particular type of leap, and its identification within William Forsythe's complex and deconstructed choreographic style would require careful visual examination. Without access to a video of the performance, a definitive and accurate count of the steps in question cannot be provided.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a number.>>>"
