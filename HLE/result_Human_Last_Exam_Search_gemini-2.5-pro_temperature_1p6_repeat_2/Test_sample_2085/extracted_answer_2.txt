Based on the etymological evidence, there is no single direct modern French equivalent for the Gaulish name "Odobeccus." The component "-beccus" translates to "bec" (beak, mouth) in French. The prefix "odo-" is less clear, but could relate to "elder" or "wealth." Therefore, a conceptual equivalent rather than a direct translation must be considered, such as *Vieuxbec* or *Richebec*.
