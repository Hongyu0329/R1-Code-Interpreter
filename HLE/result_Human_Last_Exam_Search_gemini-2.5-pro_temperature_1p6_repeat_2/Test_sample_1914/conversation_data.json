    "There are 9 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nLet the two objects be denoted by $A$ and $B$. Any category with 2 objects must have two identity morphisms, $id_A: A \\to A$ and $id_B: B \\to B$. This leaves two non-identity morphisms to be defined, let's call them $f$ and $g$. The structure of the categories is determined by the domains and codomains of $f$ and $g$, and by their composition rules.\n\nHere is a list of the 9 non-isomorphic categories:\n\n1.  **The category of a directed graph with two parallel edges**:\n    *   Morphisms: $id_A, id_B, f: A \\to B, g: A \\to B$.\n    *   Composition: The only non-trivial compositions are with the identities (e.g., $id_B \\circ f = f$). All other compositions of non-identity morphisms are undefined. A functor from this category to the category of sets defines a directed graph.\n\n2.  **The isomorphism category (a groupoid)**:\n    *   Morphisms: $id_A, id_B, f: A \\to B, g: B \\to A$.\n    *   Composition: $g \\circ f = id_A$ and $f \\circ g = id_B$. In this category, the objects A and B are isomorphic.\n\n3.  **The disjoint union of two groups of order 2**:\n    *   Morphisms: $id_A, id_B, f: A \\to A, g: B \\to B$.\n    *   Composition: $f \\circ f = id_A$ and $g \\circ g = id_B$. This is equivalent to the product of two monoids, each being the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n4.  **The disjoint union of a group of order 2 and an idempotent monoid**:\n    *   Morphisms: $id_A, id_B, f: A \\to A, g: B \\to B$.\n    *   Composition: $f \\circ f = id_A$ and $g \\circ g = g$.\n\n5.  **The disjoint union of two idempotent monoids**:\n    *   Morphisms: $id_A, id_B, f: A \\to A, g: B \\to B$.\n    *   Composition: $f \\circ f = f$ and $g \\circ g = g$.\n\n6.  **A category with an idempotent endomorphism on A and a morphism from A to B**:\n    *   Morphisms: $id_A, id_B, f: A \\to A, g: A \\to B$.\n    *   Composition: $f \\circ f = f$ and $g \\circ f = g$.\n\n7.  **A category with an involutive endomorphism on A and a morphism from A to B**:\n    *   Morphisms: $id_A, id_B, f: A \\to A, g: A \\to B$.\n    *   Composition: $f \\circ f = id_A$ and $g \\circ f = g$.\n\n8.  **A category with an idempotent endomorphism on B and a morphism from A to B**:\n    *   Morphisms: $id_A, id_B, f: B \\to B, g: A \\to B$.\n    *   Composition: $f \\circ f = f$ and $f \\circ g = g$.\n\n9.  **A category with an involutive endomorphism on B and a morphism from A to B**:\n    *   Morphisms: $id_A, id_B, f: B \\to B, g: A \\to B$.\n    *   Composition: $f \\circ f = id_B$ and $f \\circ g = g$.\n\nThese 9 categories represent all the distinct structures possible for a category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism. This has been confirmed by resources that enumerate small categories.\n\n<<<9>>>"
