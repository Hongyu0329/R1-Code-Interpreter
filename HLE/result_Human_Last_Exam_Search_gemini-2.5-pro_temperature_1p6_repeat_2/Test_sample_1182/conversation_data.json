    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we must analyze its reduction modulo 2. A stable curve is a specific type of singular curve where the only singularities are nodes (double points where tangents are distinct). The process of finding this \"best\" representation is called stable reduction.\n\nThe initial equation of the curve is:\n$y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n\n**Step 1: Initial Reduction**\nFirst, we reduce the equation modulo 2. This simplifies the equation to:\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nThis can be rewritten as $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. The special fiber (the curve over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$) is a \"double line,\" which is a non-reduced scheme. This indicates that the current model of the curve is not stable, and we need to perform transformations to find a better model.\n\n**Step 2: Resolving the Non-Reduced Fiber**\nTo deal with the non-reduced nature, we introduce a new variable. Let $w$ be defined by the relation $y = x + 2w$. This is a formal blow-up of the non-reduced component. Substituting this into the original equation gives:\n$(x+2w)^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n$x^2 + 4xw + 4w^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides and then dividing by 4, we obtain a new integral model for the curve in the variables $x$ and $w$:\n$xw + w^2 = 2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x$\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the New Model**\nNow, we reduce this new model modulo 2:\n$xw + w^2 \\equiv x^4 + x^3 \\pmod{2}$\n$w(x+w) \\equiv x^3(x+1) \\pmod{2}$\nThis special fiber is now a reduced curve, but it may still have singularities. To find them, we compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $w$ and find the points where they both vanish.\n- The partial derivative with respect to $w$ is $x + 2w \\equiv x \\pmod{2}$.\n- The partial derivative with respect to $x$ is $w - (4x^3 + 3x^2) \\equiv w - x^2 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nSetting both derivatives to zero gives $x=0$ and $w=0$. Thus, the only singular point on this new special fiber is at $(x,w) = (0,0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Blowing up the Singularity**\nThe model is still not stable because it has a singularity that is not a simple node. The standard procedure to resolve such a singularity is to perform a blow-up at that point. We introduce new coordinates $u$ and $t$ such that $x=u$ and $w=ut$. Substituting this into the equation $w(x+w) = x^3(x+1)$ from the special fiber gives:\n$ut(u+ut) = u^3(u+1)$\n$u^2t(1+t) = u^3(u+1)$\nFor $u \\neq 0$, we can divide by $u^2$, which yields the equation of the proper transform of the curve:\n$t(1+t) = u(u+1)$ or $t^2+t = u^2+u$\n\nThis new curve is smooth. For example, the partial derivative with respect to $t$ is $2t+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, which is never zero. The process of blowing up the singularity at $(0,0)$ replaces it with a projective line, known as the exceptional divisor, whose equation in this chart is $u=0$.\n\n**Step 5: Identifying the Components of the Stable Reduction and Counting the Nodes**\nThe stable special fiber is composed of the components obtained through this process.\n1.  The proper transform of our previous singular curve, which is now the smooth elliptic curve $C'$ with equation $t^2+t=u^2+u$.\n2.  The exceptional divisor $E$ from the final blow-up, which is a projective line with equation $u=0$.\n\nThe double points (nodes) of the stable reduction are the intersection points of these components. To find these intersections, we set $u=0$ in the equation for $C'$:\n$t^2+t = 0^2+0 \\implies t(t+1)=0$\nThis gives two solutions for $t$: $t=0$ and $t=1$.\nThus, the curve $C'$ intersects the exceptional divisor $E$ at two distinct points: $(u,t)=(0,0)$ and $(u,t)=(0,1)$.\n\nThe stable reduction of the original curve consists of two components: a genus 1 curve (an elliptic curve) and a genus 0 curve (a projective line). These two components intersect transversely at two points, which are the nodes.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of this configuration is calculated as:\n$g = g(C') + g(E) + (\\text{intersections}) - 1 = 1 + 0 + 2 - 1 = 2$.\nThis matches the genus of the original hyperelliptic curve, confirming that our construction describes the stable fiber.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the given curve has exactly two double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
