    "The two Nobel laureates reportedly featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Amartya Sen**.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, a 1969 Nobel laureate in Physics, has been confirmed to have appeared in the \"Ask Why\" ad campaign. Multiple online discussions and forums also reference the appearance of an \"Indian commentator\" in the same series of commercials. While direct confirmation of Amartya Sen's participation in the commercial is not available in the search results, he is a Nobel laureate of Indian origin who was a prominent public intellectual at the time the commercials aired.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was part of a significant public relations effort by Enron before its scandalous collapse. The campaign's goal was to portray the company as an innovative and forward-thinking entity.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
