The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a lower Ni concentration in the range of 2.5 to 7 molar percent is favored to maximize CO conversion while suppressing methane formation. For water splitting, a higher Ni content with a Ni to Ce atomic ratio of 1:1 to 3:1 has demonstrated superior performance.
