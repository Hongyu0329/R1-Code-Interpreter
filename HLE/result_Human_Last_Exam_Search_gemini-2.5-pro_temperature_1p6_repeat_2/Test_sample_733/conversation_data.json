    "There are **10** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called a **product-free set** if for all *a, b, c* ∈ *S*, the relation *ab = c* does not hold. Such a set is **maximal by inclusion** (or locally maximal) if it is not properly contained in any other product-free set in *G*. The classification of finite groups possessing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart.\n\nThe groups are classified into three cases based on the properties of the product-free set *S* = {*a*, *b*}.\n\n### Case 1: The set *S* generates the group *G*\n\nIn this case, *G* = ⟨*S*⟩. This category is further divided based on whether the elements of *S* are involutions (elements of order 2).\n\n**Subcase 1a: *S* contains no involutions.**\nThere are five such groups, all of which are cyclic:\n*   **C₄** (the cyclic group of order 4)\n*   **C₅** (the cyclic group of order 5)\n*   **C₆** (the cyclic group of order 6)\n*   **C₇** (the cyclic group of order 7)\n*   **C₈** (the cyclic group of order 8)\n\n**Subcase 1b: *S* contains at least one involution.**\nThere are three such groups:\n*   **C₂ × C₂** (the Klein four-group)\n*   **C₆** (the cyclic group of order 6)\n*   **D₆** (the dihedral group of order 12)\n\nNote that C₆ appears in both subcases.\n\n### Case 2: The set *S* does not generate the group *G*\n\nIn this case, the subgroup generated by *S*, ⟨*S*⟩, is a proper subgroup of *G*.\n\nThere are four such groups:\n*   **C₈** (the cyclic group of order 8), with the product-free set *S* = {*x*², *x*⁶}. In this case, ⟨*S*⟩ is a proper subgroup of C₈.\n*   **Q₁₂** (the dicyclic group of order 12, also known as the quaternion group of order 12), with *S* = {*g*³, *g*²} where *g* has order 6.\n*   **D₈** (the dihedral group of order 8).\n*   **Q₈** (the quaternion group of order 8).\n\n### Summary of the Groups\n\nCombining all cases and removing duplicates, the finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n\n1.  **C₂ × C₂** (Klein four-group)\n2.  **C₄** (Cyclic group of order 4)\n3.  **C₅** (Cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  **C₆** (Cyclic group of order 6)\n5.  **C₇** (Cyclic group of order 7)\n6.  **C₈** (Cyclic group of order 8)\n7.  **D₆** (Dihedral group of order 12)\n8.  **D₈** (Dihedral group of order 8)\n9.  **Q₈** (Quaternion group of order 8)\n10. **Q₁₂** (Dicyclic group of order 12)\n\nThus, there are a total of 10 such non-isomorphic finite groups.\n\n<<<10>>>"
