The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the Berezin integration rules: \( \int d\eta = 0 \) and \( \int d\eta \, \eta = 1 \). For a set of complex Grassmann variables, this measure leads to the result that the Gaussian integral \( \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\eta}\mathcal{D}\eta \, e^{-\bar{\eta} A \eta} \) is equal to the determinant of the matrix \( A \). This mathematical framework intrinsically incorporates the Pauli exclusion principle through the property that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero.
