    "The minimal number of triangles required for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, which represents the portion of the polyhedron visible from the outside, is 60.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex regular polyhedron, also known as a Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron, composed of 20 large, intersecting equilateral triangular faces. Its vertices, numbering 12, are arranged in the same way as those of a regular convex icosahedron.\n\nThe outer-hull, or visible surface, of the great icosahedron is what is seen from an external viewpoint, excluding the internal, intersecting parts of the faces. This visible surface forms a star-shaped polyhedron. The most prominent features are 12 \"spikes\" or pyramids, each centered on one of the 12 vertices.\n\nEach of these spikes is a pentagonal pyramid, meaning its base is a pentagon and it has five triangular faces. These triangular faces are the visible parts of the large intersecting equilateral triangles that constitute the great icosahedron.\n\nA triangulation of this outer-hull is a decomposition of the surface into non-overlapping triangles. The most natural and minimal triangulation is formed by the visible faces of the 12 pyramids. Since each of the 12 pyramids contributes 5 triangular faces to the visible surface, the total number of triangles is:\n\n12 pyramids Ã— 5 triangles/pyramid = 60 triangles.\n\nThis is supported by visual constructions and nets of the great icosahedron's visible surface. A common method for constructing a model of the great icosahedron involves creating 12 nets of the visible portion, with each net consisting of five triangles arranged to form a pentagrammic pyramid. This directly implies a total of 60 triangles for the complete outer surface. While some models for paper construction may subdivide these 60 triangles further into 180 smaller pieces for practical assembly, the fundamental geometric structure of the visible surface is composed of 60 triangles.\n\n"
