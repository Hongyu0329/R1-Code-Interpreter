    "Answering the question requires a step-by-step reduction of the given SKI combinator expression to determine the Church integer `n` it represents, followed by the calculation of `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Step 1: Simplifying the SKI Combinator Expression\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nFirst, let's simplify the innermost parts of the expression.\n\n1.  The sub-expression `S(I)(I)` reduces as follows, based on the definitions `Sxyz = xz(yz)` and `Ix = x`:\n    `S(I)(I)x = I x (I x) = x x`. A combinator that performs self-application is often denoted as `M`. However, for this problem, the key reduction is simply `S(I)(I) = I I (I I) = I I = I`.\n\n2.  The rightmost part of the main expression is `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`. Since `S(I)(I)` reduces to `I`, this part becomes `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`. Let's name this term `NUM`.\n    `NUM = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n\n3.  The main expression now looks like this, with `NUM` substituted:\n    `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(NUM))))(NUM)`\n\n4.  We can now reduce this structure. The combinator `S(I)` has a specific behavior when applied to two arguments, `X` and `Y`: `S(I)XY = IY(XY) = Y(XY)`. This pattern of reduction will be used repeatedly. Let the entire expression be `E`.\n    `E = S(I) (S(I) (S(I) (K(NUM)))) (NUM)`\n\n    Let `A = S(I) (S(I) (K(NUM)))`.\n    So, `E = S(I) A (NUM)`.\n    Using the reduction rule `S(I)XY = Y(XY)`, we get:\n    `E = NUM (A NUM)`\n\n5.  Now we must evaluate `A NUM`.\n    `A = S(I) (S(I) (K(NUM)))`. Let `B = S(I) (K(NUM))`.\n    So, `A = S(I) B`.\n    Applying `A` to `NUM`: `A NUM = S(I) B (NUM) = NUM (B NUM)`.\n\n6.  Next, we evaluate `B NUM`.\n    `B = S(I) (K(NUM))`.\n    Applying `B` to `NUM`: `B NUM = S(I) (K(NUM)) NUM = NUM (K(NUM) NUM)`.\n    Since `Kxy = x`, `K(NUM)NUM` reduces to `NUM`.\n    So, `B NUM = NUM(NUM)`.\n\n7.  Now, we substitute the results back.\n    *   `A NUM = NUM (B NUM) = NUM (NUM (NUM))`\n    *   `E = NUM (A NUM) = NUM (NUM (NUM (NUM)))`\n\nThe entire expression `E` is equivalent to `NUM(NUM(NUM(NUM)))`.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Church Integer\n\nNow we need to determine the value of `NUM`.\n\n1.  `NUM = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`.\n    The combinator `S(S(K S)K)` is the successor function, commonly denoted as `succ`. It takes a Church numeral and returns the next one.\n\n2.  A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes two arguments, `f` and `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times: `n f x = f^n(x)`.\n\n3.  The combinator `I` is `Î»x.x`. When applied to two arguments, `f` and `x`, it behaves like the Church numeral for 1: `I f x = f x`, which is the definition of `1 f x`.\n\n4.  Therefore, `NUM = succ(I)` can be interpreted as the successor of the Church numeral 1, which is the Church numeral 2.\n\nSo, `NUM` represents the integer 2.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Final Expression\n\nThe expression `E` is `NUM(NUM(NUM(NUM)))`, which, with `NUM=2`, becomes `2(2(2(2)))`.\n\nIn Church numeral arithmetic, applying one numeral `m` to another numeral `n`, written as `m(n)`, corresponds to exponentiation, specifically `n^m`.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression from the inside out:\n1.  `2(2)` corresponds to `2^2`, which is 4.\n2.  The expression becomes `2(2(4))`. `2(4)` corresponds to `4^2`, which is 16.\n3.  The expression becomes `2(16)`. `2(16)` corresponds to `16^2`, which is 256.\n\nThus, the Church integer `n` represented by the expression is 256.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating log_2(n)\n\nThe final step is to calculate `log_2(n)`.\n`n = 256`\n`log_2(256) = log_2(2^8) = 8`\n\n<<<8>>>"
