    "**Dionysius Faczony Served as Judge of Bártfa in 1461**\n\nIn the year 1461, the official serving as the judge, or *richtár*, of the Royal Free Town of Bártfa (present-day Bardejov, Slovakia) was Dionysius Faczony. His name, also recorded with the spellings Fazonyi and Fatzonyi, appears in historical records of the town for that year.\n\nThe Faczony family was a prominent and influential part of Bártfa's patrician class during the mid-15th century. This social standing aligns with holding the significant office of town judge, which was an elected position following the town's elevation to a free royal town in 1376.\n\nBártfa, a flourishing center of trade and craftsmanship in the 15th century, was governed by a town council headed by the judge. The council and the judge were responsible for the town's administration, justice, and economic affairs. The existence of detailed town archives from this period, including correspondence, points to a well-organized civic structure in which individuals like Dionysius Faczony played a key role."
