    "This question asks for the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This is a map that arises in homotopy theory in the context of loop space decompositions and Whitehead products.\n\nFirst, let's identify the spaces involved:\n*   $\\Omega X$ denotes the loop space of a pointed space $X$.\n*   $\\Sigma X$ denotes the reduced suspension of a pointed space $X$.\n*   $S^n$ is the $n$-dimensional sphere.\n*   $A \\wedge B$ is the smash product of pointed spaces $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe target space can be simplified using the fact that $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$. Therefore, the target space is $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nNext, we determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces. The connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n*   **Target Space Connectivity:** The sphere $S^{10}$ is 9-connected. The loop space functor $\\Omega$ decreases connectivity by one. Thus, the target space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Source Space Connectivity:** The connectivity of the source space $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is determined as follows:\n    *   $S^4$ is 3-connected, so $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected.\n    *   $S^6$ is 5-connected, so $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product of two spaces with connectivities $c_1$ and $c_2$ is $c_1 + c_2 + 1$. Thus, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2 + 4 + 1) = 7$-connected.\n    *   The suspension functor $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by one. Therefore, the source space $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is 8-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $k$ for which $f$ induces an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i < k$ and a surjection on $\\pi_i$ for $i=k$. Since both the source and target spaces are 8-connected, their homotopy groups up to dimension 8 are trivial. The map between trivial groups is necessarily an isomorphism, so the connectivity of the map is at least 9.\n\nTo determine the precise connectivity, we rely on a known result in homotopy theory. The map in question is a specific instance of a map $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n)$. According to a result by F. R. Cohen, this map is $(m+n-1)$-connected.\n\nFor the given spaces, we have $m=4$ and $n=6$. Applying this result, the connectivity of the map is $4 + 6 - 1 = 9$.\n\nThis means that the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for all $i < 9$ (which is trivial for $i \\le 8$) and a surjection on the 9th homotopy group, $\\pi_9$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
