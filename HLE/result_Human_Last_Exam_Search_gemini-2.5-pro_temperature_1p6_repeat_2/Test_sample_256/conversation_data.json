    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C1 in Schoenflies notation. This information is based on the comprehensive database of circle packing configurations provided by Eckard Specht on the website packomania.com.\n\nOn this authoritative website, a detailed table, \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle,\" lists the properties of the optimal packings for a large number of circles (N). For each N, the table provides data such as the radius of the circles, the packing density, and the symmetry group of the arrangement in Schoenflies notation. In cases where the symmetry group is the trivial group, containing only the identity operation, it is denoted as C1. For the specific case of N=1135, the corresponding entry in the table specifies a symmetry group of C1.\n\n<<<C1>>>"
