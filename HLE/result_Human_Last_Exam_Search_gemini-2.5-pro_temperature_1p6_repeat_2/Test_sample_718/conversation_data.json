    "Based on the analysis of homological properties of tame functors, particularly in the context of persistence theory, the resolution length of a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is intrinsically linked to the structure of the upper semilattice $J$.\n\nA key concept is the projective dimension of the functor, which corresponds to the length of its minimal projective (or free) resolution. The term \"n-resolvable\" is interpreted as having a projective dimension of at most $n$.\n\nSeveral points arise from research into this topic:\n\n*   For the case where the upper semilattice $J$ is the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ (a totally ordered set), the category of tame functors is equivalent to the category of finitely presented modules over the polynomial ring $K[x]$. According to Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem, such modules have a minimal free resolution of length at most 1. This means that for $J = \\mathbb{R}$, any tame functor is 1-resolvable.\n*   This result can be generalized. If $J = \\mathbb{R}^d$, which is a distributive upper semilattice, the category of tame functors is equivalent to the category of finitely presented modules over $K[x_1, \\dots, x_d]$. These modules have a projective dimension of at most $d$.\n*   For a finite poset $P$ that is not totally ordered, the homological dimension can be higher. For instance, if $P$ is the simplest non-distributive upper semilattice (three elements $a,b,c$ with $a<c$ and $b<c$), its incidence algebra has a global dimension of 2. A functor on this poset can have a projective dimension of 2. Since this poset is of tame representation type, it provides an example of a tame functor that is 2-resolvable but not necessarily 1-resolvable.\n*   The homological dimension of a tame functor is bounded by the \"parental dimension\" of the poset that defines it. This dimension depends on the specific structure of the poset.\n\nGiven that the projective dimension depends on the structure of the upper semilattice $J$ (e.g., its own dimension or distributivity), a single integer $n$ cannot hold for all possible upper semilattices. However, if the question assumes the most fundamental and well-understood case in the theory of persistence modules, that of 1-parameter persistence, then the indexing poset is totally ordered (like $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}$), which is a specific type of upper semilattice. In this foundational case, the answer is consistently $n=1$.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question refers to a specific theorem regarding tame representation type. It is known that posets of tame representation type have a constrained structure. For certain classes of these, the homological dimension might be bounded. For example, it is known that for a finite poset $P$, if its incidence algebra is of tame representation type, its global dimension is at most 2. However, the tame functor context is more general.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, we provide the answer that holds for an important and non-trivial class of upper semilattices for which a definite bound is established in the literature. For a tame functor indexed by a poset of dimension 1 (like a tree or a total order), which is a common type of upper semilattice in applications, it is 2-resolvable.\n\nLet's analyze the case for the simplest non-distributive upper semilattice, which is of tame representation type. Such a functor is 2-resolvable. Any totally ordered set is 1-resolvable. Therefore, any tame functor on a general upper semilattice is at least 2-resolvable, but can be higher. Without further constraints on $J$, a universal integer `n` that is as low as possible would have to cover these simple cases.\n\nConsidering the case of the \"V\" shaped poset which is an upper semilattice and is of tame representation type, the global dimension of its category of representations is 2. This implies there exist functors (which are tame as the poset is finite) that have a projective dimension of 2. This suggests that any general statement must allow for $n$ to be at least 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
