    "For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model with n replicas is the supermanifold SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassman variables parametrize the bosonic sector of this space.\n\nThe bosonic sector of a supergroup G/H is the space G_B / H_B, where G_B and H_B are the bosonic parts of the respective supergroups.\n*   The bosonic part of the supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) is Sp(2n, R) × O(2n).\n*   The bosonic part of the supergroup U(n|n) is U(n) × U(n).\n\nTherefore, the manifold for the bosonic sector is (Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)) / (U(n) × U(2)). For the case of two replicas, we set n=2, which gives the manifold (Sp(4, R) × O(4)) / (U(2) × U(2)).\n\nThe number of non-Grassman variables needed to parametrize this space is its dimension. The dimension of a coset space G/H is given by dim(G) - dim(H). Thus, the required number of variables is:\n\ndim(Sp(4, R)) + dim(O(4)) - dim(U(2)) - dim(U(2))\n\nThe dimensions of these Lie groups are calculated as follows:\n*   The dimension of the symplectic group Sp(2n, R) is n(2n+1). For n=2, dim(Sp(4, R)) = 2(2*2 + 1) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the orthogonal group O(n) is n(n-1)/2. For n=4, dim(O(4)) = 4(4-1)/2 = 6.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². For n=2, dim(U(2)) = 2² = 4.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the dimension of the bosonic manifold:\n\nDimension = 10 + 6 - 4 - 4 = 8.\n\nTherefore, 8 non-Grassman variables are needed.\n\n<<<8>>>"
