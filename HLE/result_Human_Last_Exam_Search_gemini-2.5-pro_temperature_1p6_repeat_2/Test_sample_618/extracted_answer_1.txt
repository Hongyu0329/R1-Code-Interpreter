The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations is generated by the vector fields $X_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$, $X_2 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$, and $X_3 = e^{k_1 t} u \frac{\partial}{\partial u}$. The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on the coordinate $x$ is $\xi(t, x, u) = c$, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.
