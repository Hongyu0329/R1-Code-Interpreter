    "The equilibrium values for the entropy and mean energy of the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas) can be determined using principles from large deviation theory, which find their physical application in the framework of statistical mechanics. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding why a system at equilibrium is overwhelmingly likely to be found in the macrostate that maximizes entropy for a given set of constraints, such as fixed average energy.\n\n### Theoretical Foundation: Large Deviation Theorems\n\n*   **Sanov's Theorem**: This theorem states that the probability of an empirical distribution deviating from the true underlying distribution is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is governed by the relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence). In statistical mechanics, this implies that the macroscopic state corresponding to the maximum number of microscopic configurations (i.e., maximum entropy) is the most probable one. Any deviation from this equilibrium state is a \"large deviation\" and is thus extremely rare in a system with many particles.\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem is a more specific case that deals with the probability of the empirical average of a set of random variables deviating from its expected value. This provides the basis for understanding why macroscopic properties like mean energy are so sharply defined at equilibrium.\n\nFor a system of bosons like photons, maximizing the statistical entropy subject to a constant average energy leads to the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average number of particles `<n(ε)>` in a state with energy `ε`. The large deviation theorems justify why this distribution governs the equilibrium properties of the system.\n\n### The Photon Gas Case\n\nIn the specific case of a photon gas (the \"Bose case of light quanta\"), two key characteristics are important:\n1.  Photons are bosons and thus follow Bose-Einstein statistics.\n2.  The number of photons is not conserved, as they can be absorbed and emitted by the container walls. This leads to a chemical potential of zero (μ=0) at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium distribution for the average number of photons with energy ε is given by the Planck distribution:\n\n`<n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε / k_B T) - 1)`\n\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nTo find the mean energy (E) of the photon gas, one must integrate the energy of photons over all possible energy states, weighted by the Planck distribution and the density of states `g(ε)`. For photons in a three-dimensional volume `V`, the density of states (including two polarization states) is:\n\n`g(ε) = (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) * ε^2`\n\nwhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe total mean energy is the integral of `ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε)`:\n\n`E = ∫_0^∞ (ε * (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) * ε^2) / (exp(ε / k_B T) - 1) dε`\n\nSolving this integral yields the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy of black-body radiation:\n\n`E = (π^2 k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) * V * T^4`\n\nThe **equilibrium mean energy per unit volume** is therefore:\n\n`u = E / V = (π^2 k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) * T^4`\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe entropy (S) of the photon gas can be calculated from the thermodynamic relation `S = (E - A) / T`, where A is the Helmholtz free energy. For a system with zero chemical potential, the Helmholtz free energy is `A = -E / 3`.\n\nThis gives:\n\n`S = (E - (-E/3)) / T = (4E) / (3T)`\n\nSubstituting the expression for the mean energy E, we find the equilibrium entropy:\n\n`S = (4 / 3T) * (π^2 k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) * V * T^4 = (4π^2 k_B^4 / (45 ħ^3 c^3)) * V * T^3`\n\nThe **equilibrium entropy per unit volume** is:\n\n`s = S / V = (4π^2 k_B^4 / (45 ħ^3 c^3)) * T^3`\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (per unit volume):**\n`u = (π^2 k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) * T^4`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (per unit volume):**\n`s = (4π^2 k_B^4 / (45 ħ^3 c^3)) * T^3`\n>>>"
