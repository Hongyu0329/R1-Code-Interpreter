The final expression for the magnetic field vector `H(x,z) = (H_x, H_y, H_z)` is given by its components:

`H_x(x, z) = - \frac{\pi J_c d w^2}{8 D^2} \frac{\sinh(\frac{2\pi x}{D})\sin(\frac{2\pi z}{D})}{[\sinh^2(\frac{\pi x}{D}) + \sin^2(\frac{\pi z}{D})]^2}`

`H_y(x, z) = 0`

`H_z(x, z) = H_a - \frac{\pi J_c d w^2}{4 D^2} \frac{\sinh^2(\frac{\pi x}{D})\cos^2(\frac{\pi z}{D}) - \cosh^2(\frac{\pi x}{D})\sin^2(\frac{\pi z}{D})}{[\sinh^2(\frac{\pi x}{D}) + \sin^2(\frac{\pi z}{D})]^2}`

where:
*   `Jc` is the critical current density.
*   `d` is the thickness of the strips.
*   `2w` is the width of the strips.
*   `D` is the stacking interval.
*   `Ha` is the applied magnetic field in the z-direction.
