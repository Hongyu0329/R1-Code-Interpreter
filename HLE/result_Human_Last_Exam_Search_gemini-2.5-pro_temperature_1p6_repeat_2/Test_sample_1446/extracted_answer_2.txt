Based on the provided context, the precise value of the critical exponent ν is contingent on the specific universality class attributed to the "G₄-theoretical framework". For a 3D O(4) model, ν ≈ 0.748; for a 2D 4-state Potts model, ν = 2/3; for a 3D Ising model, ν ≈ 0.630; and in mean-field theory (d≥4), ν = 1/2.
