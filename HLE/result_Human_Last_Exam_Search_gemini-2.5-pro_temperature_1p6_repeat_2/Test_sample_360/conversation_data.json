    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a total of **two** isomers are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the doubly chelating ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, displacing the two chloride ligands from two equivalents of the *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) complex. This results in the formation of a dinuclear ruthenium complex where the thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based ligand acts as a bridge between the two ruthenium centers.\n\nThe starting ruthenium complex, *cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂], is chiral and exists as two enantiomers (Δ and Λ). When this chiral complex reacts with the bridging ligand, the resulting dinuclear complex can exist as two different diastereoisomers:\n\n*   A **meso** (Δ/Λ) form, which has a center of inversion.\n*   A **racemic** (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ) form, which contains a two-fold rotation axis and exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n\nThese two diastereoisomeric forms have been successfully separated and characterized.\n\n<<<2>>>"
