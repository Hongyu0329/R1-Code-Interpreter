    "There are no closed orientable 3-manifolds with a fundamental group of cardinality 10!.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Groups of 3-Manifolds:** According to the Elliptization Theorem, a landmark result in geometry proven by Grigori Perelman, any closed, orientable 3-manifold with a finite fundamental group is a spherical 3-manifold. This means the manifold is of the form S³/Γ, where Γ is a finite subgroup of SO(4) that acts freely on the 3-sphere, S³. The fundamental group of such a manifold is isomorphic to Γ.\n\n2.  **Conditions on the Fundamental Group:** For a finite group Γ to act freely on the 3-sphere, it must satisfy a crucial algebraic condition: every abelian subgroup of Γ must be cyclic. This is equivalent to stating that for any prime number *p*, the group Γ cannot contain a subgroup isomorphic to the direct product Z<sub>p</sub> × Z<sub>p</sub>.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Order of the Group:** The question specifies that the fundamental group has a cardinality of 10!. The value of 10! is 3,628,800. The prime factorization of this number is 2⁸ × 3⁴ × 5² × 7¹.\n\n4.  **The Sylow Subgroups:** By Sylow's theorems in group theory, if a group Γ has order 10!, it must contain subgroups (called Sylow p-subgroups) of order 3⁴, 5², and 7¹.\n    *   Let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroup, which must have order 3⁴ = 81.\n    *   It is a well-established theorem in group theory that any group of order *p*⁴ (where *p* is a prime) contains a subgroup isomorphic to Z<sub>p</sub> × Z<sub>p</sub>. In our case, any group of order 81 is guaranteed to have a subgroup isomorphic to Z₃ × Z₃.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since any group of order 10! must contain a subgroup of order 81, it must also contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z₃ × Z₃. This violates the necessary condition for a group to be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold.\n\nTherefore, no such group can exist, and consequently, there are zero closed orientable 3-manifolds with a fundamental group of cardinality 10!.\n\n<<<0>>>"
