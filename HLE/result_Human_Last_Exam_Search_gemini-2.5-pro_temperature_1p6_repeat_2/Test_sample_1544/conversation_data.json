    "The search results provided links to several online chess analysis tools. However, they did not give a direct analysis for the specific FEN provided. I need to use one of these tools to get the answer. I will modify the plan to reflect this. I will use an online analysis tool with the provided FEN to get the optimal move.\nI have found several online chess analysis tools but no direct analysis of the provided FEN. I need to use one of these tools to determine the best move for White. Since I cannot directly interact with these websites, I will search for the specific analysis of the FEN on a well-known chess analysis website.The search for the specific FEN on lichess.org did not yield a direct analysis. It seems I am unable to directly access an analysis for the given position through web searches alone. I must now change my approach. I will analyze the position based on general chess principles and the visible threats and opportunities.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n\n*   **White:**\n    *   The White queen on f2 is a powerful piece, but it is currently attacked by the Black queen on c5.\n    *   The passed pawn on d6 is a major asset and a significant threat to Black.\n    *   The pawn on a4 restricts Black's queenside and supports the d6 pawn.\n    *   The king on g1 is relatively safe.\n    *   White's primary goal is to promote the d6 pawn or to checkmate the Black king.\n\n*   **Black:**\n    *   The Black queen on c5 is very active, controlling important squares and putting pressure on White's queen and king.\n    *   The king on b6 is somewhat exposed.\n    *   The pawn on d7 blocks the d-file but can be a target.\n    *   The pawn on a5 puts pressure on White's queenside.\n    *   Black's main goal is to use the queen's activity to create counterplay, either by forcing a perpetual check, winning material, or creating mating threats.\n\n**Candidate Moves for White:**\n\n1.  **Qxc5+:** This is the most forcing move. It eliminates Black's most active piece, the queen. After Qxc5+, Black must recapture with Kxc5. This simplifies the position into a pawn endgame.\n2.  **Qf3:** This move saves the queen from attack and keeps the pressure on Black. However, it allows Black to continue creating threats with the queen.\n3.  **Kg2:** This move improves the king's safety by moving it away from potential checks on the first rank.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nAfter analyzing the position and the candidate moves, the most promising move for White appears to be **Qxc5+**. Let's analyze the resulting endgame after Qxc5+ Kxc5:\n\n*   White has a passed pawn on d6.\n*   Black has a king on c5 that can try to stop the pawn.\n*   White's king is on g1.\n\nWhite's plan would be to advance the d-pawn, supported by the king. Black's plan would be to use their king to blockade the pawn. A key factor will be the race between White's pawn and Black's king.\n\nLet's consider the move sequence after Qxc5+ Kxc5:\n\n1.  ... Kxc5\n2.  d7\n\nNow Black's king is on c5 and cannot stop the pawn from promoting on d8. For example:\n\n2.  ... Kb6\n3.  d8=Q+\n\nWhite will have a queen against a lone king and can easily win. If Black's d-pawn moves, for example:\n\n2. ... d5\n3. d8=Q\n\nThe pawn will still promote.\n\nTherefore, the move **Qxc5+** forces a winning endgame for White. Any other move allows Black to maintain significant counterplay with their active queen, making the path to victory much more complicated and uncertain.\n\nI am now confident in my analysis and the final answer.\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
