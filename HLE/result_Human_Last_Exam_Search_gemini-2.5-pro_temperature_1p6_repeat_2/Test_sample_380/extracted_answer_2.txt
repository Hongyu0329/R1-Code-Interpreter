The local magnetic field is not considered radial for the calculation of normalized magnetic helicity at the L1 point. The calculation is performed using magnetic field components perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction, which is typically not radial due to the Parker spiral configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field.
