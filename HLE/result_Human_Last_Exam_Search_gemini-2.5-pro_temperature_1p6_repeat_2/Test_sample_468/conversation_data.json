    "The common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in its native range of North America is \"fairy bees\". This name is also sometimes used in conjunction with \"miner bees\".\n\nThe exact year the name \"fairy bees\" was coined is not definitively documented in a single authoritative source. However, evidence suggests the name is a relatively recent invention. An article from the Vermont Center for Ecostudies in 2020 states that common names for many bee species are \"still in their infancy and not widely adapted or standardized\". A discussion on iNaturalist in 2021 suggests the name was given approximately five years prior, around 2016, with another user mentioning a rumor that the name originated on Twitter. The use of the term appears in publications from at least 2018 and 2019.\n\n<<<fairy bees, circa 2016>>>"
