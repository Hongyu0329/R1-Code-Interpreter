    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel Definition:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a d-dimensional system is described by the map:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\n    where $\\rho$ is the density matrix, $\\{U_k\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution (meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum p_k = 1$). The Pauli operators form a complete orthogonal basis for the space of operators on the d-dimensional Hilbert space.\n\n2.  **Kraus Operators:** The Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. A minimal set of Kraus operators would only include those for which $p_k > 0$.\n\n3.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank:** The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the information about the operation that leaks to the environment. A fundamental result in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel (more formally, its Choi rank) is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix formed by the Kraus operators of the original channel.\n\n4.  **Gram Matrix Calculation:** The Gram matrix $G$ is defined by its elements $G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(A_k^\\dagger A_l)$. For the Pauli channel, this is:\n    $G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}\\left((\\sqrt{p_k} U_k)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_l} U_l)\\right) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l)$\n\n5.  **Orthogonality of Pauli Operators:** The generalized Pauli operators are orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, which means:\n    $\\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$\n    where $d$ is the dimension of the system and $\\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\n6.  **Rank of the Gram Matrix:** Substituting the orthogonality relation into the expression for the Gram matrix gives:\n    $G_{kl} = d \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\delta_{kl} = d \\cdot p_k \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$\n    This shows that the Gram matrix $G$ is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries are $d \\cdot p_k$. The rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the number of its non-zero entries. Therefore, the rank of $G$ is the number of probabilities $p_k$ that are strictly greater than zero.\n\n7.  **Maximizing the Rank:** To find the maximal rank of the complementary channel, we need to find the maximum possible number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$. Since there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, there are $d^2$ corresponding probabilities. A valid channel can be constructed where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. For example, the completely depolarizing channel can be represented as a Pauli channel with $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k=0, \\dots, d^2-1$. For this channel, all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-zero entries in the Gram matrix is $d^2$, and thus the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
