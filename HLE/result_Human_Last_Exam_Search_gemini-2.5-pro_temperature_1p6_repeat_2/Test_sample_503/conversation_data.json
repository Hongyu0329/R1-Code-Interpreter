    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, consists of a pair of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ such that the identity morphism on $[m]$ is less than or equal to the composition $g \\circ f$, and $f \\circ g$ is less than or equal to the identity morphism on $[n]$. This pair of conditions is equivalent to the standard definition of an adjunction between posets, where $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint.\n\nA map $f: P \\to Q$ between two posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema that exist in $P$. The objects of the simplex category, $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, k\\}$, are finite total orders, and thus complete lattices. For any subset of $[k]$, its supremum is its maximum element, and for the empty set, the supremum is the minimum element, 0. An order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ preserves non-empty suprema (maxima). For $f$ to preserve all suprema, it must also preserve the supremum of the empty set. This means that $f(\\sup(\\emptyset_{\\text{in }[m]})) = \\sup(f(\\emptyset_{\\text{in }[n]}))$. This simplifies to $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, a map $g: Q \\to P$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima. The infimum of the empty set in $[k]$ is its maximum element, $k$. For an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ to preserve all infima, it must preserve the infimum of the empty set, which means $g(\\inf(\\emptyset_{\\text{in }[n]})) = \\inf(g(\\emptyset_{\\text{in }[m]}))$. This simplifies to $g(n)=m$.\n\nTherefore, counting the number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$ is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: \\to$ is a sequence of integers $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that $0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$. With the condition $f(0)=0$, we are looking for the number of non-decreasing sequences $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ of length 23 with values taken from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has 38 elements.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. The number of such sequences is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{\\binom{n}{k}}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{n+k-1}{k}$, where $k=23$ is the length of the sequence and $n=38$ is the number of possible values.\nThe number of adjunctions is therefore:\n$$ \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAlternatively, we could count the number of right adjoints $g: \\to$. This requires counting the number of order-preserving maps that satisfy $g(37)=23$. This means we are counting non-decreasing sequences $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$ of length 37 with values from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has 24 elements. The number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we can see that $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, confirming the result.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<114449304111943500>>>"
