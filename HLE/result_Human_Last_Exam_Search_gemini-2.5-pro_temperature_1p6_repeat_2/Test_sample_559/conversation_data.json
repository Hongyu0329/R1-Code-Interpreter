    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors, and such curves are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nLet's denote $d(t)$ as $d$ and $u(t)$ as $u$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$, we get $2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. Thus, **(0, 0)** is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$, we get $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2+2d=0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. Thus, **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)** are equilibrium points.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix}$:\n\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4d - 3u + 5u^2$.\n\n*   At **(1, 0)**: $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 = 2$. Both eigenvalues are positive, so (1, 0) is an **unstable node**.\n*   At **(1, -1)**: $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 = -2$. The eigenvalues have opposite signs, so (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1). We look for an invariant algebraic curve that passes through this point. Let's test the curve $d = -u^2$.\n\n*   The curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1) since $-1 = -(1)^2$.\n*   The curve also passes through the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n\nTo verify if $d=-u^2$ is an invariant curve, we differentiate it with respect to $t$: $d' = -2uu'$. We then substitute this and $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation:\n\n$-2uu' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$-2uu' = 2u^4 - (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n$-2uu' = 2u^4 + 5u^4 - 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n$-2uu' = 8u^4 - 4u^3$\n\nNow, let's substitute the second differential equation, $u' = u^2(u-1) = u^3-u^2$, into the left side of our derived equation:\n\n$-2u(u^3-u^2) = -2u^4+2u^3$\n\nLet's recheck the right side of the main equation substitution:\n\n$2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u) = 2u^4 + (3u^3-5u^4) -u^3+u^4 = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4+2u^3$\n\nThe left side equals the right side. Thus, $d=-u^2$ is an invariant curve of the system. Since it passes through the saddle point (1,-1), it represents the stable and/or unstable manifolds. Trajectories on this curve move away from the point (1, -1) as for $u$ near 1, $u(t)$ moves away from 1. This confirms that $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThe separatrix for the system in the upper half-plane $u \\geq 0$ is therefore the curve given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<The separatrix is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
