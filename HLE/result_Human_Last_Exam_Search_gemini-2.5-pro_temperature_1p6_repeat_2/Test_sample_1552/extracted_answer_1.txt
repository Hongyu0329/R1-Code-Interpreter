The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is the integrated density `a₂`. The component of this coefficient that depends on the square of the gauge field strength `F_{μν}` is `(-1/3) * (1/(16π²)) ∫ d⁴x √g F_{μν}F^{μν}`. The full coefficient also includes terms quadratic in the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor, and the scalar curvature.
