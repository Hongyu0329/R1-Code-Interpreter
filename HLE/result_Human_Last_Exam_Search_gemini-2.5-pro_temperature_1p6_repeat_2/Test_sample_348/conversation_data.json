    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\n**1. Finding Market Equilibrium (Price P_e and Quantity Q_e)**\n\nThe supply and demand functions are given as:\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q_s³ - 2)\n*   **Demand:** P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_d))\n\nAt equilibrium, P_s = P_d = P_e and Q_s = Q_d = Q_e. Therefore, we set the two equations equal to each other:\nln(Q_e³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_e))\n\nThis equation is complex and cannot be solved analytically. By using numerical methods or a graphing tool to find the intersection of the two functions, we find the approximate equilibrium quantity:\n**Q_e ≈ 3.012**\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into either the supply or demand equation to find the equilibrium price (P_e). Using the demand function:\nP_e = 18 * e^(-arctan(3.012))\nP_e ≈ 18 * e^(-1.25)\n**P_e ≈ 5.228**\n\nThe equilibrium point is approximately **(3.012, 5.228)**.\n\n**2. Calculating Consumer and Producer Surplus**\n\nThe total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS). These are calculated using definite integrals.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve, above the equilibrium price.\n    CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (P_e * Q_e)\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve, below the equilibrium price. The supply function P = ln(Q³ - 2) is defined for Q > ∛2.\n    PS = (P_e * Q_e) - ∫[∛2 to Q_e] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\n**3. Numerical Integration**\n\nThese integrals do not have simple elementary antiderivatives and must be solved using numerical integration.\n\n*   **Integral for CS:** Using a numerical integration calculator for the demand function from 0 to 3.012:\n    ∫[0 to 3.012] 18 * e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ ≈ 31.789\n\n*   **Integral for PS:** Using a numerical integration calculator for the supply function from ∛2 (approximately 1.26) to 3.012:\n    ∫[1.26 to 3.012] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ ≈ 3.518\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Values**\n\nNow we can calculate CS and PS:\n\n*   **CS** = 31.789 - (5.228 * 3.012)\n    CS = 31.789 - 15.748\n    **CS ≈ 16.041**\n\n*   **PS** = (5.228 * 3.012) - 3.518\n    PS = 15.748 - 3.518\n    **PS ≈ 12.230**\n\n**5. Total Welfare**\n\nFinally, the total welfare (TW) is the sum of consumer and producer surplus:\nTW = CS + PS\nTW = 16.041 + 12.230\n**TW ≈ 28.271**\n\n<<<28.271>>>"
