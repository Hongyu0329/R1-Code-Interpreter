The interaction between the human voltage-gated calcium channel alpha-1 and beta-1 subunits is a complex process involving distinct regions for physical binding and for the modulation of channel function.

**1) Residues for Alpha-1 Subunit Interaction:**

The primary site of interaction on the beta-1 subunit is the **Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain**. This domain contains a hydrophobic pocket that binds to the Alpha-Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit. Key residues forming this hydrophobic pocket in the human beta-1 subunit are a conserved **quartet of leucine residues**:

*   **Leucine 287 (L287)**
*   **Leucine 389 (L389)**
*   **Leucine 423 (L423)**
*   **Leucine 428 (L428)**

Mutation of these residues significantly disrupts the interaction between the two subunits. While a "beta-interaction domain" or BID was once thought to be the binding site, it is now understood to be crucial for the structural integrity of the beta-1 subunit itself, rather than for direct interaction.

**2) Residues for Gating Modulation:**

The fine-tuning of the alpha-1 subunit's gating properties is a more intricate function involving several domains of the beta-1 subunit.

The **HOOK domain**, which links the SH3 and GK domains, is a critical modulator of gating. This domain can be functionally subdivided into:
*   A **polyserine (S) domain**
*   A **polyacidic (A) domain**
*   A **polybasic (B) domain**

The interplay of these subdomains influences the channel's inactivation kinetics.

Specific residues within the HOOK domain of the human beta-1a isoform serve as hotspots for phosphorylation-dependent modulation:

*   **Serine 193 (S193):** Phosphorylation at this site can decrease peak channel currents and shift the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation.
*   **Threonine 205 (T205):** This is a PKA-dependent phosphorylation site that modulates channel activity, particularly calcium-dependent inactivation.

The **Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain** is also essential for full modulatory function, acting in concert with the GK domain. While specific hotspot residues within the SH3 domain for gating modulation are not as clearly defined as the phosphorylation sites in the HOOK domain, its structural integrity and interaction with the GK domain are indispensable for proper channel regulation.
