The common eigenvalues for J² are (15/4)ħ² and (3/4)ħ². The common eigenvalues for Jz are ±(3/2)ħ and ±(1/2)ħ. The specific pairings are determined by the total angular momentum quantum number j and the magnetic quantum number m_j. For j=3/2, the J² eigenvalue is (15/4)ħ² and the Jz eigenvalues are ±(3/2)ħ, ±(1/2)ħ. For j=1/2, the J² eigenvalue is (3/4)ħ² and the Jz eigenvalues are ±(1/2)ħ.
