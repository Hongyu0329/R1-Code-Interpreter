    "In the problem of spin-orbit coupling for a p-electron, we are considering the addition of the orbital angular momentum (**L**) and the spin angular momentum (**S**) to form the total angular momentum (**J**).\n\n### Determining the Quantum Numbers\n\nFor a p-electron:\n*   The orbital angular momentum quantum number is **l = 1**.\n*   As it is an electron, its spin angular momentum quantum number is **s = 1/2**.\n\nThe total angular momentum operator is defined as **J = L + S**. The quantum number *j* for the total angular momentum can take values from |l - s| to l + s in integer steps.\n\n*   j = |1 - 1/2|, ..., 1 + 1/2\n*   j = 1/2, 3/2\n\nSo, we have two possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number: **j = 3/2** and **j = 1/2**.\n\n### Eigenvalues of J²\n\nThe operator for the square of the total angular momentum is **J²**. Its eigenvalues are given by the formula:\n\nEigenvalue(J²) = ħ² * j * (j + 1)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   For **j = 3/2**:\n    Eigenvalue(J²) = ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = ħ² * (3/2) * (5/2) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n\n*   For **j = 1/2**:\n    Eigenvalue(J²) = ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = ħ² * (1/2) * (3/2) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of J² are **(15/4)ħ²** and **(3/4)ħ²**.\n\n### Eigenvalues of Jz\n\nThe operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is **Jz**. Its eigenvalues are determined by the magnetic quantum number *m_j*, and are given by the formula:\n\nEigenvalue(Jz) = ħ * m_j\n\nThe possible values for *m_j* range from -j to +j in integer steps.\n\n*   For the **j = 3/2** state, the possible values of *m_j* are:\n    *   m_j = -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2\n    *   The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are: **- (3/2)ħ, - (1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (3/2)ħ**\n\n*   For the **j = 1/2** state, the possible values of *m_j* are:\n    *   m_j = -1/2, 1/2\n    *   The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are: **- (1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ**\n\n### Common Eigenvalues Summary\n\nThe common eigenstates are those states |j, m_j⟩ which are simultaneously eigenstates of both J² and Jz. The corresponding common eigenvalues are the pairs of eigenvalues for these operators.\n\nThe set of all possible common eigenvalues are:\n\n| j | Eigenvalue of J² | m_j | Eigenvalue of Jz |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 3/2| (15/4)ħ² | 3/2 | (3/2)ħ |\n| 3/2| (15/4)ħ² | 1/2 | (1/2)ħ |\n| 3/2| (15/4)ħ² | -1/2 | -(1/2)ħ |\n| 3/2| (15/4)ħ² | -3/2 | -(3/2)ħ |\n| 1/2| (3/4)ħ² | 1/2 | (1/2)ħ |\n| 1/2| (3/4)ħ² | -1/2 | -(1/2)ħ |\n\n<<<The common eigenvalues for J² are (15/4)ħ² and (3/4)ħ². The common eigenvalues for Jz are ±(3/2)ħ and ±(1/2)ħ. The specific pairings are determined by the total angular momentum quantum number j and the magnetic quantum number m_j. For j=3/2, the J² eigenvalue is (15/4)ħ² and the Jz eigenvalues are ±(3/2)ħ, ±(1/2)ħ. For j=1/2, the J² eigenvalue is (3/4)ħ² and the Jz eigenvalues are ±(1/2)ħ.>>>"
