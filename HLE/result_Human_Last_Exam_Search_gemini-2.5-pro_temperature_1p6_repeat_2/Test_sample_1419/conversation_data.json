    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions (specifically in d = 4 - ε dimensions), the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant determines the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling. The exact expression depends on the normalization of the coupling constant in the Lagrangian.\n\nThe Lagrangian for the ϕ⁴ theory typically includes an interaction term of the form (g/4!)ϕ⁴. The beta function, which describes the running of the coupling constant `g` with the energy scale, is given at one-loop order by:\n\nβ(g) = -εg + (3 / (16π²))g²\n\nThe non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, occurs when the beta function is zero (β(g*) = 0). Solving for g* gives the leading order expression:\n\n**g* = (16π² / 3)ε**\n\nIt is common in the literature to absorb the numerical and π factors into a rescaled dimensionless coupling constant, leading to simpler-looking expressions. Depending on the convention used for this rescaling, different expressions for the fixed-point coupling can be found:\n\n*   If a rescaled coupling `u` is defined such that its beta function is β(u) = -εu + (3/2)u², the fixed point is at **u* = (2/3)ε**.\n*   If another rescaled coupling `λ` is defined to have a beta function of β(λ) = -ελ + 3λ², the fixed point becomes **λ* = ε/3**.\n\nThese different expressions all represent the same physical fixed point, and the numerical prefactors are a matter of convention in how the coupling constant is defined.\n\n<<<g* = (16π² / 3)ε>>>"
