    "Trisyllabic laxing, also known as trisyllabic shortening, is a phonological process in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in a syllable that is followed by two or more other syllables, the first of which is unstressed. To determine which of the provided words has not undergone this process, each word's etymology and phonological history must be examined.\n\n*   **Southern**: This word derives from the Old English *sūþerne*, which had three syllables. The original long vowel /uː/ (spelled 'ū') was shortened to the lax vowel /ʌ/ in Modern English because it was in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. This is an example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **Derivative**: This word is related to \"derive.\" The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the trisyllabic word *derivative* (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/). This change is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing prompted by the addition of a suffix.\n\n*   **Serenity**: This word is the noun form of the adjective \"serene.\" The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* laxes to /ɛ/ in *serenity* (/səˈrɛnəti/). This is a well-documented case of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **Gratitude**: Related to the word \"grateful,\" *gratitude* shows a change from the tense vowel /eɪ/ in \"grateful\" to the lax vowel /æ/ in *gratitude* (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/). This shortening is a result of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **Pleasant**: This word, with two syllables, is related to the verb \"please.\" While the tense vowel /iː/ in \"please\" is laxed to /ɛ/ in \"pleasant,\" this process is known as **disyllabic laxing** because the word is not three or more syllables long. Therefore, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **Shadow**: Similar to \"pleasant,\" \"shadow\" is a two-syllable word. It is paired with \"shade,\" and the tense vowel /eɪ/ in \"shade\" becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in \"shadow.\" This is also an example of **disyllabic laxing**, not trisyllabic laxing.\n\nBoth \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" did not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing as they are disyllabic words. However, the formation of \"shadow\" is distinct within this list. The other five words, including \"pleasant\", involve the addition of a suffix to a root word. \"Shadow,\" in contrast, evolved from an Old English inflected form, *sceadwe*, the oblique case of *sceadu* (\"shade\"). This unique morphological origin makes it stand out from the others which all follow a root-plus-suffix pattern.\n\nGiven that \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" are the only two words that have not undergone trisyllabic laxing, but \"shadow\" has a more distinct morphological history compared to the rest of the list, it can be considered the most exceptional case.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
