    "Analyzing the chess position with FEN `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`, White has a forced checkmate in 6 moves, assuming optimal play from both sides.\n\nThe winning sequence of moves for White is as follows:\n1. Qxe1+ R(e8)xe1\n2. Bxf7+ Kh7\n3. Bg6+ Kh8\n4. Nf7+ Kg8\n5. Nxh6+ Kh8\n6. Rf8#\n\nThis sequence leads to a checkmate, securing the win for White in 6 moves.\n\n<<<6>>>"
