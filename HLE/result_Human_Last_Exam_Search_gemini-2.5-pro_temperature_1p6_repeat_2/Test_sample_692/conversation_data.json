    "## Olmecs Recorded America's Oldest Known Date in 650 BCE\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is \"3 Ajaw,\" which corresponds to a day in the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. This significant inscription, dated to approximately 650 BCE, was discovered at the Olmec archaeological site of San Andrés in the present-day state of Tabasco, Mexico.\n\nThe date is inscribed on a ceramic cylinder seal and fragments of a greenstone plaque. The seal depicts a bird with speech scrolls emanating from its beak, which are interpreted as \"King 3 Ajaw,\" suggesting the glyph represents not only a date but also a ruler's name. This discovery is crucial as it indicates the Olmec civilization, considered the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica, had developed a sophisticated system of writing and a calendrical system tied to kingship and ritual activities.\n\nWhile the Olmec Cascajal Block, discovered near the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán site, is considered the oldest known writing in the Western Hemisphere, dating to around 900 BCE, it does not appear to contain a calendrical date. The Cascajal Block features 62 distinct symbols arranged in rows but is not a calendrical record.\n\nOther contenders for the earliest recorded date include a Zapotec monument from San José Mogote in Oaxaca. Monument 3, a carved stone depicting a captive, features glyphs between the figure's legs interpreted as the name \"1 Earthquake,\" a day in the sacred calendar. While initially dated to 500-600 BCE, some scholars have expressed doubts about this dating.\n\nA more definitively dated, though much later, inscription is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo. This monument bears the oldest known Long Count calendar date, which correlates to December 36 BCE. However, the Olmec finding at San Andrés predates this by several centuries.\n\nTherefore, the \"3 Ajaw\" inscription from the Olmecs at San Andrés remains the most widely accepted evidence of the earliest recorded date in the aboriginal writing systems of the Americas.\n\n<<<3 Ajaw>>>"
