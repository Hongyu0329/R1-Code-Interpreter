    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the protagonist, Police Superintendent Otchumyelov, and his greatcoat are described on six separate occasions, with the coat serving as a potent symbol for his fluctuating and servile mentality. The descriptions of his interactions with the coat mirror his rapid changes in opinion based on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n\nThe instances of the coat's description are as follows:\n*   The story begins with the initial image of \"The police superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat...\"\n*   As the situation with the dog bite escalates and it is suggested the dog might belong to the General, Otchumyelov becomes flustered and hot, demanding of his subordinate, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot!\"\n*   Moments later, when a voice in the crowd confirms the dog is the General's, Otchumyelov's tune changes abruptly. \"H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up... I'm cold...\"\n*   After the General's cook states they do not own such a dog, Otchumyelov, once again, reverses his stance and, feeling the heat of the situation, says, \"Take my coat off, Yeldrin...\".\n*   The cook then clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother, prompting another shift in Otchumyelov's behavior.\n*   Finally, as the matter is \"resolved\" to his satisfaction, \"Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat and walks away down the market square.\"\n\nThe frequent removal and donning of his overcoat serve as a visual gag and a literary device that underscores Otchumyelov's spinelessness and obsequiousness. His physical comfort, or discomfort, with the coat directly reflects his anxiety and his attempts to align himself with the powerful. His actions make him a caricature of an official who is more concerned with social hierarchy than with justice, justifying the story's title.\n\n<<<6>>>"
