    "I have been unable to identify an Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus. It is possible the user is mistaken about the film's Oscar nomination status or is conflating scenes from different movies.\n\nNumerous searches were conducted to find a film matching this specific sequence of events. While there are Oscar-nominated films with significant bus scenes, such as \"Midnight Cowboy,\" where a character dies on a bus, or \"A Woman Under the Influence,\" which features a poignant scene at a bus stop, none of them include the detail of the character's fate being sealed by the words \"Thank you\" upon boarding.\n\nFurther searches removing the \"Oscar-nominated\" constraint also failed to yield a matching result. This suggests that the film may not exist as described or is not well-known.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify the film you are referring to based on the details provided. It is possible that the film was not Oscar-nominated or that some details of the scene have been misremembered.>>>"
