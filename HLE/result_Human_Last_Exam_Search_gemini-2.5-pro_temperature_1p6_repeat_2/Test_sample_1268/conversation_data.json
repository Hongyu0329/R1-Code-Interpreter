    "I am unable to provide a direct answer to your question as it seems to be based on a misunderstanding of mathematical concepts and notations. The notation \"k(k,∞)\" is not standard in the mathematical literature concerning the relationship between the covolume of arithmetic manifolds and norms. Additionally, the relationship between a \"maximum norm\" and the covolume, particularly in the context of squarefree natural numbers, is not straightforward and depends heavily on the specific mathematical objects being considered (e.g., arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds, cusp forms, etc.).\n\nBased on my research, here is a summary of related mathematical concepts that might be relevant to your query:\n\n### Sup-Norms of Cusp Forms and Covolume\n\nIn the study of automorphic forms on arithmetic manifolds, a significant area of research is finding upper bounds for the supremum norm (or L∞-norm, denoted ||f||∞) of Hecke-Maass cusp forms in terms of the covolume of the underlying group.\n\n*   For arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces, it is conjectured that for a Hecke-Maass cusp form ϕ, the sup-norm ||ϕ||∞ is of the order of V^(ε) for any ε > 0, where V is the volume (covolume). However, established bounds are weaker, for instance ||ϕ||∞ ≪ V^(5/24+ε) for squarefree levels N. The level N of the congruence subgroup Γ0(N) is often a squarefree integer in these studies, and the covolume of the corresponding manifold is related to N.\n\n### Injectivity Radius and Covolume\n\nThe injectivity radius of a Riemannian manifold is the largest radius of a ball that can be isometrically embedded at each point. There are relationships between the injectivity radius, which can be seen as a form of \"local size,\" and the total volume (covolume) of the manifold.\n\n*   In general, for a hyperbolic n-manifold, the systole (the length of the shortest closed geodesic) is bounded above by a logarithmic function of the volume.\n*   For certain arithmetic manifolds, there is a logarithmic relationship between the length of the shortest geodesic at a cusp and the covolume of the manifold.\n\n### Number Fields\n\nIn algebraic number theory, for a number field K, one can consider its ring of integers OK.\n\n*   The covolume of the ring of integers OK embedded in a real vector space is related to the square root of the absolute value of the discriminant of the field, denoted |DK|.\n*   The number of principal ideals with norm at most X is related to the covolume (via the discriminant and the regulator) and other invariants of the number field.\n\nWithout a more precise definition of \"k(k,∞)\" and the specific context you are interested in, it is not possible to provide a specific upper bound. The relationships are complex and are the subject of ongoing mathematical research.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific answer.>>>"
