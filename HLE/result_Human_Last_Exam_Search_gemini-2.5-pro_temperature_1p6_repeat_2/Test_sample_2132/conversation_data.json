    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate. This reaction involves a ring contraction from a six-membered ring to a five-membered ring when conducted in the presence of a base such as sodium ethoxide.\n\nThe Böttcher molecular complexity is a metric used to quantify the structural complexity of a molecule. It is calculated as an additive score based on the microenvironment of each individual atom, taking into account connectivity, stereochemistry, and symmetry. This results in a value expressed in 'mcbit' (molecular bit).\n\nWhile the methodology for this calculation is established, and online tools exist for its computation, the specific Böttcher molecular complexity score for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is not available in the searched literature. The PubChem database lists a \"Complexity\" value of 114 for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate; however, this is a different complexity metric and should not be confused with the Böttcher score.\n\nWithout access to a specialized calculator or a publication containing the pre-calculated value, the specific Böttcher Molecular Complexity for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate cannot be provided.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a numerical answer.>>>"
