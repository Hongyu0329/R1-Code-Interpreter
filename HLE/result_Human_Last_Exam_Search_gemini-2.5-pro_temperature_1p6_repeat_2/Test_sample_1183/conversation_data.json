    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is **D3h**.\n\nThe molecule, known as triethynyl-substituted triangulene or a triethynyl-substituted triangular graphene flake, possesses a high degree of symmetry. Its structure is planar and exhibits a principal three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the triangular core.\n\nAdditionally, the molecule has three two-fold axes of rotation (C₂) that lie within the molecular plane, each passing through the central point and one of the ethynyl-substituted corners. The presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) coincides with the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nA point group is a set of symmetry operations that leave a molecule unchanged. The combination of a C₃ principal axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) unequivocally assigns the molecule to the D3h point group. This is analogous to simpler molecules like boron trifluoride (BF₃), which also belongs to the D3h point group due to its trigonal planar geometry. The D3h point group is characterized by these, along with other symmetry elements such as three vertical mirror planes (σv) and an improper rotation axis (S₃).\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
