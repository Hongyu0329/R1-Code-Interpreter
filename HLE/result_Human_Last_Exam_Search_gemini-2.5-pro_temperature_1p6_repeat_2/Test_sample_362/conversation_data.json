    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. This reaction involves a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with a carbonyl compound. The key outcome is the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom with the carbon group from the ylide, forming a new carbon-carbon double bond. The location of this new double bond is precisely where the carbonyl group was, which is a major advantage of this method.\n\nTo determine the product of the specified reaction, we first need to identify the structures of the two reactants:\n\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the chemical structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄). The triphenylphosphine group (PPh₃) is attached to a two-carbon \"ethylidene\" chain, which in turn has a 2-chlorophenyl group attached to its second carbon.\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the aldehyde's (CH₃)₃C-CH= group will combine with the ylide's =CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄) group. The triphenylphosphine part of the ylide and the oxygen from the aldehyde are eliminated as triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O), which is a very stable compound and provides the driving force for the reaction.\n\nThe resulting product is formed by connecting the two carbon fragments with a double bond:\n\n**(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)**\n\nThe correct IUPAC name for this alkene is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The reaction can produce two different geometric isomers, (E) and (Z), and the specific isomer that is favored depends on the reaction conditions and the stability of the ylide.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
