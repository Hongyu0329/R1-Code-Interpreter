    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a part of the larger palliovisceral lobe complex, which is situated in the posterior region of the subesophageal mass of the cuttlefish brain. This entire complex is located towards the rear of the brain and is encased posteriorly by cranial cartilage. The palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape movements and the ejection of ink.\n\nDetailed neuroanatomical studies and the 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish reveal the spatial arrangement of the lobes within the palliovisceral lobe complex. The posterior chromatophore lobes, which control the chromatophores (color-changing cells) of the mantle, and the fin lobes, which control the movement of the fins, are positioned posteriorly to the main palliovisceral lobe. The entire posterior subesophageal mass, including these lobes, projects through an opening in the cranial cartilage.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe complex also includes the lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes.\n\n<<<The posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
