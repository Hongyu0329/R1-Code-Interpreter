    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nand\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1],\nwe can use the method of row reduction on the compound matrix P formed by stacking P1 and P2.\n\nFirst, we form the compound matrix P:\nP = [ s^2 + s,  -s   ;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2  ;\n        s     ,  0   ;\n       -s - 1 ,  1    ]\n\nLet the rows be R1, R2, R3, and R4. We perform polynomial elementary row operations to reduce this matrix to a simpler form, such as a row-echelon form. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix will form a GCRD.\n\n1.  Add R3 to R4 to create a row with constant entries:\n    `R4_new = R4 + R3 = [-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-1, 1]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [ s^2 + s,  -s  ;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2 ;\n        s     ,  0  ;\n       -1     ,  1   ]\n\n2.  Swap R1 and the new R4 to bring the constant row to the top:\n    [ -1     ,  1   ;\n        s     ,  0  ;\n      s^2 + s,  -s  ;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2  ]\n\n3.  Use the new R1 `[-1, 1]` to eliminate the first column entries in the other rows:\n    *   `R2_new = R2 + s*R1 = [s, 0] + s*[-1, 1] = [0, s]`\n    *   `R3_new = R3 + (s^2 + s)*R1 = [s^2 + s, -s] + (s^2 + s)*[-1, 1] = [0, s^2]`\n    *   `R4_new = R4 - (s^2 + 1)*R1 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - (s^2 + 1)*[-1, 1] = [0, -1]`\n    The matrix is now:\n    [ -1,  1 ;\n       0,  s ;\n       0, s^2 ;\n       0, -1  ]\n\n4.  Swap R2 and R4 to bring `[0, -1]` to the second row:\n    [ -1,  1 ;\n       0, -1 ;\n       0, s^2 ;\n       0,  s  ]\n\n5.  Use the new R2 `[0, -1]` to eliminate the second column entries in the other rows:\n    *   `R1_new = R1 + R2 = [-1, 1] + [0, -1] = [-1, 0]`\n    *   `R3_new = R3 + s^2*R2 = [0, s^2] + s^2*[0, -1] = [0, 0]`\n    *   `R4_new = R4 + s*R2 = [0, s] + s*[0, -1] = [0, 0]`\n    The final matrix is:\n    [ -1,  0 ;\n       0, -1 ;\n       0,  0 ;\n       0,  0  ]\n\nThe non-zero rows of this reduced matrix form a GCRD. Thus, a GCRD is:\nG = [-1, 0;\n      0, -1]\n\nSince the greatest common right divisor is unique only up to a left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant), we can multiply G by `-I` (which is unimodular) to obtain the identity matrix, which is a simpler form.\n\nGCRD = `[-1, 0; 0, -1] * [-1, 0; 0, -1] = [1, 0; 0, 1]`\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0;\n0, 1]>>>"
