    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would be a nanocar derivative where all the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds have been replaced by carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds. The term \"perfluoro\" signifies this complete substitution of hydrogen with fluorine.\n\nThe exact number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar depends on the specific structure of the nanocar in question, as different nanocars have been synthesized with varying molecular formulas. For instance, researchers have described a nanocar with the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. If this particular nanocar were to be perfluorinated, all 34 of its hydrogen atoms would be replaced with fluorine atoms.\n\nTherefore, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar based on this specific design would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nIt is important to note that other nanocar structures exist with different numbers of hydrogen atoms. For example, a \"nanotruck\" molecule is reported to have the formula C₂₈₂H₁₈N₄, which would result in 18 fluorine atoms upon perfluorination. Another mentioned nanocar has the formula C₄₃₀H₂₇₄O, which would hypothetically contain 274 fluorine atoms if perfluorinated.\n\n<<<34>>>"
