    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the Danish-born explorer who served the Russian navy, Vitus Bering. The poet asks about his final resting place in the poem \"Monologue of Vitus Bering.\"\n\nIn 1991, a Russian-Danish expedition discovered the grave of Bering and five other sailors on Bering Island, off the Kamchatka Peninsula. This discovery in the early 1990s answered the question Voznesensky had posed in his poetry. Forensic analysis of the remains was conducted in Moscow before they were reburied on the island. Bering died in 1741 after the Second Kamchatka Expedition, during which he had sighted the coast of Alaska, and was shipwrecked on the island that now bears his name.\n\nAndrei Voznesensky also wrote the poem \"Saga,\" which mentions Bering, comparing a lost ant's journey on a wood chip to the explorer's voyage. His work frequently touched upon themes of exploration and sailors.\n\n<<<Bering>>>"
