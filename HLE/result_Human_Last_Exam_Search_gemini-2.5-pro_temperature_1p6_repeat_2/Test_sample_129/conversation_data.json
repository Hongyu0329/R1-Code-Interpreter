    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we can systematically categorize and count the expressions based on their structure and primary operator. The precedence rules are `!` > `&` > `|`.\n\nWe can classify all possible valid expressions of length 5 by their main operator, which is the last one to be evaluated according to the precedence rules.\n\n### 1. Expressions with `|` as the main operator\n\nThese are expressions of the form `A | B`. For `|` to be the main operator, it must not be inside parentheses and must have the lowest precedence.\n\n*   **Chains of ORs (`A|B|C`)**: These expressions have the form of three literals connected by `|`. For the expression to be true, at least one of the literals must be `T`. There are 2Â³ = 8 possible combinations of `T` and `F`. Only the combination `F|F|F` evaluates to false. Thus, there are 7 true expressions in this form (e.g., `T|T|T`, `T|T|F`, `T|F|F`, etc.). **(7 expressions)**\n*   **Mixed Precedence (`&` and `|`)**: These are expressions like `A&B|C` or `A|B&C`.\n    *   `A|B&C` is parsed as `A|(B&C)`. This is true if `A` is `T`, or if `A` is `F` and `B&C` is `T`.\n        *   If `A` is `T`, the expression is always true. There are 4 combinations for `B&C` (`T&T`, `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`). This gives 4 expressions (`T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`).\n        *   If `A` is `F`, `B&C` must be true, which only happens for `T&T`. This gives 1 expression (`F|T&T`).\n    *   `A&B|C` is parsed as `(A&B)|C`. This is symmetric to the case above.\n        *   If `C` is `T`, the expression is always true. There are 4 combinations for `A&B`. This gives 4 expressions (`T&T|T`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T`).\n        *   If `C` is `F`, `A&B` must be true. This gives 1 expression (`T&T|F`).\n    *   Total for this subcategory is 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10 expressions. **(10 expressions)**\n*   **Involving the `!` operator**:\n    *   `!A | !B`: The sub-expressions `!A` and `!B` each have length 2. True expressions are `!F|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!T|!F`. **(3 expressions)**\n    *   `A | !!B` and `!!A | B`: The sub-expression `!!B` or `!!A` has length 3. We need one part to be true.\n        *   `T|!!T` (True), `T|!!F` (True), `F|!!T` (True). (3)\n        *   `!!T|T` (True), `!!T|F` (True), `!!F|T` (True). (3)\n        *   This gives a total of 6 such expressions. **(6 expressions)**\n\nTotal for the `|` root operator: 7 + 10 + 3 + 6 = 26.\n\n### 2. Expressions with `&` as the main operator\n\nThese are of the form `A & B`, where A and B do not contain `|` as a main operator. For the expression to be true, both A and B must be true.\n\n*   **Chains of ANDs (`A&B&C`)**: Only `T&T&T` evaluates to true. **(1 expression)**\n*   **Involving the `!` operator**:\n    *   `!A & !B`: Both `!A` and `!B` must be true. This means `A` and `B` must be `F`. The expression is `!F&!F`. **(1 expression)**\n    *   `A & !!B` and `!!A & B`: Both parts must be true. `A` must be `T`, and `!!B` must be true (so `B` is `T`), giving `T&!!T`. Symmetrically, we have `!!T&T`. **(2 expressions)**\n\nTotal for the `&` root operator: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n\n### 3. Expressions with `!` as the main operator\n\nThese have the form `!A`, where `A` is a false expression.\n\n*   **Chains of NOTs**: `!!!!A`. To be length 5, this must be `!!!!T` or `!!!!F`. `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`. **(1 expression)**\n*   **Negating a parenthesized expression**: This has the form `!(A)`. For the total length to be 5, `A` must have length 2. So we are looking for `!(A)` where `A` is a false expression of length 2. The only false expression of length 2 is `!T`. This gives `!(!T)`, which evaluates to `T`. **(1 expression)**\n\nTotal for the `!` root operator: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### 4. Expressions with parentheses `()` as the main structure\n\nThis category is for expressions where the entire length-5 string is enclosed in parentheses, which is not possible. However, we consider expressions of the form `(A)`, where `A` is an expression of length 3, and the parentheses are necessary for its standard evaluation as a single unit. The value is the value of `A`.\n\n*   `(A)` where `A` is a true expression of length 3.\n    *   `A` can be `X op Y`. True expressions are `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. **(4 expressions)**\n    *   `A` can be `!!X`. `(!!T)` is a true expression. **(1 expression)**\n\nTotal for parenthesized expressions: 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSumming the counts from all categories:\n*   `|` as main operator: 26\n*   `&` as main operator: 4\n*   `!` as main operator: 2\n*   `()` as main structure: 5\n\nTotal = 26 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
