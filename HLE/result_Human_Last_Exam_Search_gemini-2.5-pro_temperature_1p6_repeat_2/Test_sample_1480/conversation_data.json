    "In a fuzzy logic system, the activation level of a rule, also known as the firing strength, is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the membership values of the rule's antecedents and consequents. A t-norm is a type of function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy logic.\n\nThe two most commonly used t-norm operations are the **minimum (or Gödel) t-norm** and the **product t-norm**. The calculation of the rule activation level depends on which of these t-norms is applied.\n\nGiven:\n*   The firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   The membership degree in the consequent fuzzy set, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nThe rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm to these two values.\n\nHere are the results for the most common t-norms:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm:** The activation level is the minimum of the two values.\n    `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Using the Product t-norm:** The activation level is the product of the two values.\n    `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the rule activation level could be either of these values, or another value if a different t-norm is used. However, the minimum and product t-norms are the most prevalent in fuzzy systems.\n\n<<<The rule activation level is 0.7 if using the minimum t-norm, and 0.63 if using the product t-norm.>>>"
