    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation, utilizing Feynman's path integral formalism, is given by a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields. This formulation is fundamental in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics for describing systems of fermions at finite temperature.\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as:\n<br>\n<br>\n$$\nZ = \\int_{\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)} \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi}\\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}\n$$\n<br>\nWhere the components of the formula are:\n\n*   **Z**: The thermal partition function, which is equivalent to the trace of the thermal density matrix, Z = Tr(e‚Åª·µá·¥¥), where Œ≤ is the inverse temperature (Œ≤ = 1/T) and H is the Hamiltonian of the system.\n\n*   **Grassmann Fields (œà, œàÃÑ)**: The fields œà(x, œÑ) and œàÃÑ(x, œÑ) are not ordinary numbers but are independent, anticommuting Grassmann numbers. This mathematical necessity arises from the anticommuting nature of fermionic creation and annihilation operators.\n\n*   **Path Integral Measure (ùíüœàÃÑùíüœà)**: This represents the functional integration over all possible configurations of the fermion fields œà and its conjugate œàÃÑ throughout spacetime.\n\n*   **Imaginary Time (œÑ)**: The formulation uses imaginary time, œÑ, which is related to real time, t, by a Wick rotation (œÑ = it). The integration in the action is performed over the interval [0, Œ≤] in the imaginary time direction.\n\n*   **Euclidean Action (S_E)**: This is the action of the fermionic system formulated in Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time). A common form for the Euclidean action for non-interacting fermions is:\n    <br>\n    $$\n    S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau} + H \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)\n    $$\n    <br>\n    Here, H can be the single-particle Hamiltonian, which might include kinetic energy and potential terms. The transition from the Minkowskian action (iS) in real-time to the Euclidean action (-S_E) is a key step in defining the thermal path integral.\n\n*   **Anti-periodic Boundary Conditions**: A defining characteristic of the fermionic partition function is the imposition of anti-periodic boundary conditions on the fermion fields in the imaginary time direction:\n    <br>\n    $$\n    \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau + \\beta) = -\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau + \\beta) = -\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)\n    $$\n    <br>\n    These boundary conditions are a direct consequence of the fermionic anticommutation relations when evaluating the trace in the definition of the partition function. For bosonic fields, periodic boundary conditions are used instead.\n\nFor actions that are quadratic in the fermion fields (bilinear), this Gaussian Grassmann integral can be evaluated exactly and yields the determinant of the operator in the action.\n<br>\n<br>\n$$\nZ = \\det\\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau} + H \\right)\n$$\n<br>\nThis determinant is then calculated over the space of functions that satisfy the required anti-periodic boundary conditions.\n\n<<<\n$$\nZ = \\int_{\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)} \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi}\\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)\\right)\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- **Z** is the partition function.\n- **`‚à´ DœàÃÑDœà`** denotes the functional integral over all configurations of the Grassmann-valued fermion fields `œà` and `œàÃÑ`.\n- The integral is performed subject to **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in the imaginary time `œÑ` direction: `œà(œÑ + Œ≤) = -œà(œÑ)` and `œàÃÑ(œÑ + Œ≤) = -œàÃÑ(œÑ)`.\n- **`Œ≤ = 1/T`** is the inverse temperature.\n- **`S_E = ‚à´ dœÑ ‚à´ d·µàx L_E`** is the Euclidean action.\nA common form for the Euclidean Lagrangian density, `L_E`, is `œàÃÑ(‚àÇ/‚àÇœÑ + H)œà`, where `H` is the Hamiltonian operator."
