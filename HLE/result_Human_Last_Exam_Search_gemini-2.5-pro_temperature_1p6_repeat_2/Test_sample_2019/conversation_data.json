    "The initial search has provided some useful context about the n-queens problem on a toroidal board. Specifically, it mentions that for an n x n toroidal board, a solution for placing n non-attacking queens exists if and only if n is not divisible by 2 or 3. Since 5 is not divisible by 2 or 3, solutions exist for placing 5 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. However, the user is asking for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens, not 5. The search results do not directly provide this number. Therefore, I need to perform more targeted searches to find this specific information.The previous searches provided general information about the n-queens problem on standard and toroidal boards. I found that solutions for n queens on an n x n toroidal board exist if n is not divisible by 2 or 3, which is the case for n=5. However, the user is asking for the number of ways to place *4* non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, and this specific number is not present in the search results. I also searched for OEIS sequences that might contain this value but did not find a direct match. The provided search results discuss the complexity of the n-queens problem and mention that for some cases, the number of solutions has been found through computer searches. It's likely that this specific problem has been solved and the result might be available in a specialized database or publication. To find the precise number, I need to look for resources that tabulate these values.The performed searches and the review of the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences) did not directly provide the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. The search results focused on the n-queens problem where the number of queens equals the board size (n=k). Some results discussed the conditions for the existence of solutions for n queens on an n x n toroidal board. I also found information on the number of ways to place n non-attacking rooks and bishops, but not for a different number of queens than the board size on a toroidal board. It appears this specific enumeration is not readily available in the common resources. To answer the user's question, I will need to find a source that either explicitly states this number or provides a method to calculate it. This might involve looking for more specialized publications or databases on chess-related combinatorial problems. Since my current tools have not yielded the answer, and further searching with the same tools is unlikely to succeed, I will need to try a different approach. I will try to find a paper or a book that lists these values.The extensive searches for \"4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard\" and related terms did not yield a direct numerical answer. The search results primarily focus on the n-queens problem where the number of queens equals the board size. I found a comprehensive work by Václav Kotěšovec, \"Non-attacking chess pieces,\" which is a promising resource for such specific combinatorial problems. However, accessing the full content and finding the specific table for k queens on an n x n toroidal board within the search results is not straightforward. The other search results discuss the existence of solutions for n queens on an n x n toroidal board (solutions exist for n=5 as it's not divisible by 2 or 3) but do not enumerate the solutions for a different number of queens (k=4). Without a direct source providing the number, I am unable to give a definitive answer. It is highly likely that the answer is contained within specialized literature like Kotěšovec's book, which my current tools cannot fully access to pinpoint the exact value. Therefore, I will state that the information is not available through the conducted searches.\n\nBased on the executed searches, the exact number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard could not be determined. The available resources and search results primarily focus on the n-queens problem where the number of queens is equal to the size of the board. While it is known that solutions for 5 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board exist, the specific enumeration for 4 queens is not provided in the accessed documents. Resources like Václav Kotěšovec's \"Non-attacking chess pieces\" might contain this information, but the specific data point was not found in the search results.\n\nI have conducted multiple searches to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. The search results provided general information about the n-queens problem on both standard and toroidal boards. I learned that for an n x n toroidal board, a solution for placing *n* non-attacking queens exists if and only if n is not divisible by 2 or 3. This condition holds for a 5x5 board.\n\nHowever, the user is asking for the number of ways to place *4* non-attacking queens, not 5. This specific enumeration is not readily available in the general search results, which primarily focus on the case where the number of queens equals the board size. Specialized resources, such as Václav Kotěšovec's book \"Non-attacking chess pieces\", likely contain this information in detailed tables, but these tables were not accessible through the performed searches.\n\nWithout a direct source providing the precise number of configurations for 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, I am unable to provide a definitive numerical answer.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
