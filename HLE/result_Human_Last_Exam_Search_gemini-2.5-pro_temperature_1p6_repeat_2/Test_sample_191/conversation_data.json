    "The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is the **amyloid precursor protein (APP)**.\n\nThe breakdown of APP by enzymes, specifically β-secretase and γ-secretase, produces amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. These Aβ peptides can then aggregate to form the amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Macrophages, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in clearing these Aβ aggregates from the brain through a process called phagocytosis, which is the engulfment and subsequent degradation of cellular debris and pathogens.\n\nIn essence, the cleavage of APP is the initial step that generates the Aβ fragments that are subsequently targeted by macrophages for removal. Studies have shown that both microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, and peripheral macrophages that migrate to the brain are involved in this clearance process. The efficiency of this engulfment can be influenced by various factors, including the presence of other proteins like apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can modulate the degradation of Aβ by macrophages.\n\nFurthermore, research using protease inhibitors has demonstrated that reducing the processing of APP can inhibit macrophage activation that is triggered by the engulfment of platelets containing APP. This highlights the central role of APP breakdown in initiating the macrophage response to amyloid.\n\n<<<amyloid precursor protein (APP)>>>"
