$\tau_w\frac{\mathrm{d}w_i}{\mathrm{d}t} = \beta u_i \frac{v_i - \rho}{1 + v_i}$

Where:
*   $w_i$ is the synaptic efficacy.
*   $v_i = \phi x_i$ is the presynaptic accumulator.
*   $u_i = \sum_j w_j x_j$ is the shared postsynaptic accumulator.
*   $\rho = - \left( \eta + \frac{\alpha}{\beta}(1-\eta) \right)$ is a constant derived from the model parameters.
