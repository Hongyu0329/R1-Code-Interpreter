    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `abcdefg`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are critical as they form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, which dictates the number of helices in the bundle.\n\nThe sequence is 32 amino acids long, which corresponds to approximately four and a half heptad repeats. We need to find the correct \"register\" or frame of the heptad repeat. The 'a' and 'd' positions are almost always occupied by hydrophobic residues. The key hydrophobic residues in this sequence are Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Alanine (A), and Tryptophan (W).\n\nLet's analyze the sequence by assigning the start of the heptad repeat to each position and examining the resulting residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\nThe sequence can be laid out to test different registers:\n`GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nThrough systematic frame shifting, we identify two chemically plausible registers:\n\n1.  **Register 1:** `efgabcd`. If we assign the fourth residue, Alanine (A), as the first 'a' position, we get the following pattern:\n    *   **'a' positions:** A, A, A, A\n    *   **'d' positions:** L, L, L, L\n    This results in a consistent `a=A, d=L` pattern. This arrangement is similar to the `a=I, d=L` pattern that strongly favors the formation of **dimers**.\n\n2.  **Register 2:** `bcdefga`. If we assign the seventh residue, Leucine (L), as the first 'a' position, we get a different pattern:\n    *   **'a' positions:** L, L, L, L\n    *   **'d' positions:** I, I, I, I\n    This results in a very consistent `a=L, d=I` pattern.\n\nNow, we apply the established rules based on knobs-into-holes packing efficiency, which relate the identity of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions to the oligomeric state:\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by a beta-branched amino acid (like Isoleucine or Valine) at the 'a' position and a non-beta-branched amino acid (like Leucine) at the 'd' position. The `a=A, d=L` pattern of Register 1 is a variant of this and would likely favor a dimer.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored by a more even distribution and often Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions, allowing for symmetrical packing.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by a non-beta-branched amino acid (Leucine) at the 'a' position and a beta-branched amino acid (Isoleucine) at the 'd' position. This specific arrangement creates a packing interface that is most stable in a four-helix bundle.\n\nComparing our two plausible registers to these rules:\n\n*   Register 1 (`a=A, d=L`) points towards a dimer.\n*   Register 2 (`a=L, d=I`) perfectly matches the canonical pattern for a **tetramer**.\n\nThe `a=L, d=I` signal is one of the strongest and most well-characterized determinants for a specific oligomeric state in coiled-coil design. The consistent presence of Leucine at all 'a' positions and Isoleucine at all 'd' positions in this reading frame provides a very strong indication that the protein will form a tetramer to optimize the knobs-into-holes packing.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of packing efficiency, the sequence is predicted to form a tetramer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
