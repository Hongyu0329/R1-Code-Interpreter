    "The Reverse Turn is a fundamental figure in several ballroom dances, but its execution varies based on the specific technique of each dance. The possibility of \"overturning\" a turn—that is, rotating more than the prescribed amount—also depends on these technical rules.\n\nIn dances like the Waltz, Viennese Waltz, and Quickstep, while standard amounts of turn are defined, dancers often adjust the rotation for floorcraft or choreographic effect. For example, it's noted that in the Viennese Waltz, it is very difficult to overturn a Reverse Turn to navigate a corner, but it's not technically impossible. Similarly, figures in Waltz and Quickstep, such as the \"Overturned Running Spin Turn\" or \"Overturned Turning Lock,\" explicitly involve more rotation than standard turns.\n\nThe European Tango has its own unique technique, which is distinct from the swing dances. However, it also includes figures like the \"Overturned Five Step,\" indicating that overturning is a valid technical variation.\n\nThe Slow Foxtrot is the exception due to a specific technical element in the lady's part of the Reverse Turn: the heel turn. A heel turn is an action where the dancer turns on the heel of one foot, with the other foot held closely beside it. This movement has a mechanical limit on the amount of rotation possible, which is a maximum of 3/8 of a full turn. Attempting to rotate more than this amount would force the dancer to disregard the correct technique of the heel turn, likely by lifting the foot or taking an extra step, which is a clear technical violation. Therefore, because of the strict technical requirement of the lady's heel turn, it is impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn in the Slow Foxtrot without breaching the fundamental technique of the figure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
