    "The next number in the sequence is 124.\n\nThis sequence represents a series of bus routes that can be taken in a specific order. The pattern is composed of existing and, in some cases, discontinued bus route numbers primarily from the King County Metro transit system in Seattle, Washington. The repetitions in the sequence indicate traveling on the same bus route multiple times or transferring between routes at a shared stop.\n\nThe sequence includes the following King County Metro bus route numbers: 10, 36, 41, 49, 62, 67, 93, 111, 124, 142, and 155. The presence of these numbers within the King County Metro system, along with the seemingly random and repetitive nature of the sequence, strongly suggests that it is based on a real-world bus route puzzle. After the final '36', the sequence logically continues with another iteration of a prominent route number found within the set. Based on the established pattern of repeated routes, the most logical next number is 124, which appears multiple times in the latter part of the sequence.\n\n<<<124>>>"
