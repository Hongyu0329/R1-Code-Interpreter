    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, the celebrated prima ballerina Svetlana Zakharova performed a total of **seven** sissonne fermes in the Act II Odette variation.\n\nThis distinctive sequence of steps is a notable feature of Grigorovich's choreography for this iconic role. A sissonne ferme is a ballet step in which the dancer jumps from two feet and lands on one foot with the other foot extended, and then closes the extended foot. In this particular variation, Zakharova's execution of the sissonnes highlighted her renowned control and artistry. The performance of this variation in the 2014 production was part of a celebrated portrayal of Odette/Odile that was performed globally, including at the Lincoln Center Festival in New York.\n\nThe choreography for Odette's variation in Act II can vary between different productions. However, in the Grigorovich version danced by Zakharova, the sissonne fermes are performed in two distinct sets. After a series of other movements, she executes a sequence of three sissonne fermes, followed by a brief transitional step, and then a final set of four sissonne fermes leading into the concluding poses of the solo. This specific choreographic choice contributes to the unique interpretation of the character within the Bolshoi's production.\n\nThe 2014 production of *Swan Lake* at the Bolshoi Theatre, also recorded in 2015 for broadcast and home video, featured Zakharova alongside Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried. This production was noted for its adherence to Grigorovich's powerful and dramatic choreographic style.\n\n<<<7>>>"
