    "After a gene duplication event, the resulting two gene copies are initially redundant. This redundancy means that one copy is often free from the selective pressure that maintained the original gene. The fate of these duplicate genes is a central question in evolutionary biology. Several mechanisms can influence whether these genes are retained and how they might diverge in function over time.\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, resulting in the two sequences becoming identical. This mechanism actually works against the divergence of duplicate genes by homogenizing them.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. One copy accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional, turning into a pseudogene. This process leads to the loss of a functional gene, not the retention and divergence of two functional copies.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this process, one of the gene copies acquires a completely new, beneficial function through mutation, while the other copy retains the original ancestral function. This is an adaptive process that leads to the preservation of both genes, as one performs the old function and the other performs a new one.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism involves the partitioning of the ancestral gene's functions between the two duplicate copies. If the original gene had multiple functions or a complex expression pattern (e.g., active in different tissues or at different developmental stages), degenerative mutations can inactivate different subfunctions in each copy. Consequently, both genes are required to carry out the full set of functions of the ancestral gene, leading to their mutual preservation. This is considered a neutral process.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species that fill different ecological niches. It is not a molecular mechanism that explains the fate of individual duplicate genes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are key mechanisms that explain the retention and functional divergence of duplicate genes. Pseudogenization leads to loss, and gene conversion prevents divergence. However, neofunctionalization requires the relatively rare occurrence of a beneficial mutation to create a new function. In contrast, subfunctionalization provides a neutral pathway for preservation, as the duplicate copies can be preserved by complementary loss-of-function mutations, a more common type of mutation. Many researchers consider subfunctionalization a more likely and common initial step for retaining duplicate genes, which can then pave the way for further divergence, including potential neofunctionalization later on. Therefore, it is often considered the most probable mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of many duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
