    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads, with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, a series of essential controls must be prepared to ensure accurate data interpretation and proper sorter setup. These controls are vital for correct compensation of spectral overlap, accurate gate setting, and the exclusion of false positives. The recommended number of essential control tubes is between 13 and 15, depending on your specific experimental design.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the essential controls you should prepare:\n\n### **1. Unstained Controls (1 tube)**\n\n*   **Composition:** An aliquot of your cells without any fluorescent labels or streptavidin beads.\n*   **Purpose:** This control is fundamental for setting the initial voltages on the flow cytometer and determining the level of autofluorescence of your cells. Autofluorescence is the natural fluorescence of cells, and its measurement is the baseline for detecting any added fluorescent signals.\n\n### **2. Beads Alone Control (1 tube)**\n\n*   **Composition:** An aliquot of the streptavidin beads you will be using, in the same buffer as your experimental samples.\n*   **Purpose:** To determine if the streptavidin beads themselves contribute any background fluorescence in any of your five detection channels. This is crucial to avoid false positive signals originating from the beads.\n\n### **3. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 tubes)**\n\n*   **Composition:** Five separate samples, each containing your cells (or compensation beads) stained with only one of the five fluorochromes used in your panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750).\n*   **Purpose:** These controls are absolutely essential for multicolor flow cytometry. They are used to calculate the compensation matrix, which mathematically corrects for the spectral overlap of each fluorophore into other channels. Accurate compensation ensures that the signal detected in each channel is specific to the intended fluorochrome. You will need one single-stain control for each of your five channels. The staining for these controls should be as bright or brighter than your experimental sample to ensure accurate compensation.\n\n### **4. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes)**\n\n*   **Composition:** Five separate samples, where each sample is stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. For example, one FMO control will contain AF350, GFP, PE, and AF647, but not AF750. You will prepare an FMO control for each of the five channels in your panel.\n*   **Purpose:** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially when populations are not clearly separated or when expression levels are low. They reveal the spread of fluorescence from the other fluorochromes into the channel of the omitted fluorophore, allowing you to position your gates precisely to identify the true positive population for your sort.\n\n### **5. Viability Dye Control (1 tube)**\n\n*   **Composition:** A sample of your cells stained only with a viability dye.\n*   **Purpose:** Dead cells have a tendency to non-specifically bind antibodies and can be more autofluorescent, leading to false-positive results. A viability dye allows you to distinguish live cells from dead cells so that you can exclude the dead cells from your analysis and sort. This is critical for obtaining a pure population of live cells.\n\n### **6. Optional Additional Controls (1-2 tubes)**\n\n*   **Isotype Controls (Optional):** While FMO controls are now considered more appropriate for determining gating boundaries, isotype controls can sometimes be used to assess non-specific antibody binding. An isotype control is an antibody of the same immunoglobulin subclass and with the same fluorescent label as your primary antibody but does not target any protein in your sample.\n*   **Biological Controls (Experiment-dependent):** These include positive and negative control samples based on the biology of your experiment. For example, if you are sorting for cells expressing a specific marker, you would want a sample known to be positive for that marker and one known to be negative.\n\nIn summary, for your five-channel sorting experiment, you should prepare a minimum of **13 essential control tubes**:\n\n*   1 Unstained control\n*   1 Beads alone control\n*   5 Single-stain compensation controls\n*   5 Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls\n*   1 Viability dye control\n\nThis robust set of controls will provide the necessary information to properly set up the cytometer, accurately compensate for spectral overlap, and confidently gate on your population of interest for a successful sort.\n\n<<<13>>>"
