### **Counseling Recommendations for Allison**

It's good that the Excedrin helped your headache. However, based on the new prescriptions you're picking up, there are a few important points we should discuss regarding your symptoms and medications.

#### **1. Regarding Your Headache and Smell of Sea Water**

While you suspect residual motion sickness, your headache is a **very common side effect** of all three of your prescribed medications:
*   **Atorvastatin:** Headache is a known common side effect.
*   **Junel Fe 1.5/30:** Headaches and even migraines can be caused by combination birth control pills.
*   **Fluoxetine:** This is also a common side effect, especially when starting the medication.

The "smell of sea water" you're experiencing is a type of olfactory hallucination (phantosmia). While less common, this has been reported in rare cases with antidepressants and cholesterol-lowering medications like atorvastatin. It can also be a sensory symptom associated with migraines, which Junel Fe can trigger. It would be wise to mention both the headache and the smell to your doctor.

#### **2. IMPORTANT: Interaction with Excedrin**

You should **avoid taking Excedrin** while you are on Fluoxetine. Here's why:
*   Excedrin contains aspirin.
*   Fluoxetine, being an SSRI, can increase your risk of bleeding.
*   Combining Fluoxetine with aspirin significantly raises the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

For future headaches, ask your doctor about safer alternatives. Acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) is often a safer choice, provided you don't have other conditions that would prevent its use.

#### **3. Critical Warning for Junel Fe (Birth Control)**

It is crucial that you **do not smoke** while taking Junel Fe. Smoking, especially if you are over 35, dramatically increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects, including **blood clots, stroke, and heart attack**.

#### **4. Other Important Points to Monitor**
*   **Atorvastatin (for cholesterol):** Contact your doctor if you experience any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, as this can be a sign of a rare but serious side effect affecting the muscles.
*   **Fluoxetine (for mood):** It can take 4 to 5 weeks to feel the full effects of this medication. Side effects like headaches often lessen over time. Be sure to report any significant mood changes or thoughts of self-harm to your doctor immediately, which can be a rare side effect of antidepressants.

**Summary of Recommendations for Allison:**
*   Be aware that your headache is likely a side effect of one or more of your new medications, not motion sickness.
*   **Stop taking Excedrin immediately** due to the serious bleeding risk when combined with Fluoxetine. Discuss safer pain relief options with your doctor.
*   If you smoke, it is critical to stop, due to the high risk of blood clots and stroke from your birth control medication.
*   Report the headaches, the smell of sea water, and any unexplained muscle pain to your doctor.
*   Take your medications as prescribed and give the Fluoxetine several weeks to become fully effective.
