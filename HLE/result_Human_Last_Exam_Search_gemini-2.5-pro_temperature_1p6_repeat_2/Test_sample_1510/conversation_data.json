    "There are five wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\nThe symmetry of a two-dimensional repeating pattern is described by a wallpaper group. Each wallpaper group is associated with a point group, which describes the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern around a fixed point. A point group of order 2 contains two symmetry operations: the identity and either a 180-degree rotation or a reflection.\n\nThe two possible point groups of order 2 are C₂ and D₁.\n*   The point group **C₂** contains the identity and a 180° rotation.\n*   The point group **D₁** is isomorphic to C₂ and contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nThe following five wallpaper groups have a point group of order 2:\n*   **p2**: This group has 180-degree rotational symmetry but no reflections or glide reflections. Its point group is C₂.\n*   **pm**: This group has parallel reflection axes but no rotational symmetry. Its point group is D₁.\n*   **pg**: This group's symmetries consist of parallel glide reflections and translations, but no rotations. The point group associated with a glide reflection is a reflection, making its point group D₁.\n*   **cm**: This group features parallel reflection axes and glide reflections. It does not have rotational symmetry. Its point group is D₁.\n*   **pmm**: While this group has a point group of D₂, which is of order 4, some sources might loosely group it in discussions of 2-fold symmetry due to the presence of 180° rotations. However, its point group is of order 4. The same applies to **pmg**, **pgg**, and **cmm**, which all have a point group of D₂.\n\nTherefore, the wallpaper groups with a point group strictly of order 2 are p2, pm, pg, and cm. However, including cmm which also has a D2 point group containing order 2 operations can sometimes lead to confusion. Based on a strict definition, there are four. A broader interpretation considering any group with a two-fold rotation or single reflection symmetry could be interpreted differently. Based on the most direct interpretation of \"point group of order 2\", the number is four.\n\nRevisiting the source information, specifically considering the point group for the centered rectangular lattice, which applies to `cm` and `cmm`. The point group for a centered rectangular lattice is D₂. This contradicts the earlier assessment for `cm`. Let's clarify:\n*   **p2**: Point group C₂ (order 2).\n*   **pm**: Point group D₁ (order 2).\n*   **pg**: Point group D₁ (order 2).\n*   **cm**: This group is associated with a centered rectangular (rhombic) lattice and has reflection axes. Its point group is D₂.\n*   **pmm**: Point group D₂ (order 4).\n*   **pmg**: Point group D₂ (order 4).\n*   **pgg**: Point group D₂ (order 4).\n*   **cmm**: Point group D₂ (order 4).\n\nBased on this more precise look, only **p2**, **pm**, and **pg** have a point group of order 2. Let's try to find a definitive list.\n\nAnother source lists the point groups for all 17 wallpaper groups: p2 (C₂), pm (D₁), pg (D₁), cm (D₁), pmm (D₂), pmg (D₂), pgg (D₂), cmm (D₂). This indicates `cm` indeed has a point group of D1. This seems to be the more common and accurate classification.\n\nThus, there are **four** wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
