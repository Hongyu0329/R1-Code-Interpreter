    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Find the prime factorization of $N$.\n2.  Understand the structure of primitive characters of conductor $N$.\n3.  Determine the constraints on the orders of the component characters.\n4.  Count the number of possibilities for each component character.\n5.  Combine the results to find the total number of characters of order 6.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ of conductor $N$ is called primitive. A character modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nThe character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character for its modulus $p^a$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. This implies that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$, must be a divisor of 6.\n\nNow, we count the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order 2. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, there is 1 choice for $\\chi_4$.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. The imprimitive characters are those induced from modulus 3, of which there are $\\phi(3)=2$. So there are $6-2=4$ primitive characters modulo 9. The orders of elements in a cyclic group of order 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The imprimitive characters have orders 1 and 2. Thus, the primitive characters must have orders that are divisors of 6 but are not 1 or 2, which leaves orders 3 and 6. Specifically, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3 and $\\phi(6)=2$ characters of order 6. All 4 of these primitive characters have orders (3 or 6) that divide 6. So, there are 4 choices for $\\chi_9$.\n\n*   **Conductor 7**: The group of characters modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. There is 1 non-primitive character (the principal one). The other 5 are primitive. Their orders are the divisors of 6, excluding 1. There is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2, $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3, and $\\phi(6)=2$ characters of order 6. All these orders divide 6. So, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Conductor 11**: The group of characters modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The primitive characters have orders that are divisors of 10, other than 1 (i.e., 2, 5, 10). For the order to divide 6, it must be 2. There is $\\phi(2)=1$ such character. So, there is 1 choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Conductor 13**: The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of 12, excluding 1 (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). We need the orders that divide 6, which are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$. So, there are 5 choices for $\\chi_{13}$.\n\nLet's combine these results. We have a set of allowed primitive characters for each prime-power factor. Let's call them $S_{p^a}$.\n*   $|S_4|=1$ (character of order 2)\n*   $|S_9|=4$ (characters of order 3 or 6)\n*   $|S_7|=5$ (characters of order 2, 3, or 6)\n*   $|S_{11}|=1$ (character of order 2)\n*   $|S_{13}|=5$ (characters of order 2, 3, or 6)\n\nAny character $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ constructed from these sets will have an order that divides 6. The total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of choices = $|S_4| \\times |S_9| \\times |S_7| \\times |S_{11}| \\times |S_{13}| = 1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that the order is exactly 6 for all these 100 characters. Let $k$ be the order of such a character $\\chi$.\n1.  The order of $\\chi_4$ is 2. Therefore, $k = \\text{lcm}(\\dots)$ must be divisible by 2.\n2.  The order of any chosen $\\chi_9$ is either 3 or 6, both of which are divisible by 3. Therefore, $k$ must be divisible by 3.\n3.  Since $k$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3) = 6$.\n4.  As established, the order of each component divides 6, so their lcm must also divide 6.\n\nThe only integer that is a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 is 6 itself. Therefore, all 100 constructed characters have an order of exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
