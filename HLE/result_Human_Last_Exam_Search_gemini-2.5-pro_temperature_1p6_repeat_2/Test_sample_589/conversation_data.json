    "Despite extensive research, no Hollywood feature film produced by a major studio matching the precise description of a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car has been definitively identified.\n\nNumerous searches were conducted to locate a film with this specific scene. Investigations into movies featuring pink bicycles, such as *The Goonies* (1985), determined that while a teenager does ride a pink bike, the scene does not involve him pedaling directly toward an oncoming car in a confrontational manner. In this Warner Bros. film, the character Brand is briefly seen riding a little girl's pink bike alongside a car of teenagers.\n\nExplorations of film databases and forums for keywords such as \"pink bike,\" \"teenager,\" \"oncoming car,\" and \"playing chicken\" did not yield a matching result from a major Hollywood studio. While there are many independent films, short films, and television show episodes that feature similar thematic elements, none have been confirmed as a major motion picture fitting the user's specific request. Lists of films from major studios like Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, and Walt Disney Pictures were reviewed without finding a direct match to the detailed scene.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, a Hollywood feature film from a major studio with a scene precisely as described does not appear to be a widely known or easily identifiable movie.\n\n<<<No such film has been identified.>>>"
