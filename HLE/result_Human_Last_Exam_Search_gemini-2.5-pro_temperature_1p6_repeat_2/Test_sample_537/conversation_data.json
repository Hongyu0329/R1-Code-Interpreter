    "The pattern in the words is a keyboard shift cipher. Specifically, each letter in the encoded word is one key to the right of the intended letter on a standard QWERTY keyboard. To decode the words, each letter must be shifted one key to the left.\n\nApplying this pattern to the provided words reveals the following decoded terms:\n\n*   **utpshtheas** decodes to **tropical**\n*   **fkuhu** decodes to **dignity**\n*   **numhkatnatu** decodes to **blacksmith**\n*   **anhaeketn** decodes to **zodiacal**\n\n<<<zodiacal>>>"
