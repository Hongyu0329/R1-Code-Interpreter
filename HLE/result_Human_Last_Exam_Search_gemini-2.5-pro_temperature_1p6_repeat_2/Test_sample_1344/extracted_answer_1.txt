A Zirconium (Zr) metal center, chelated by a constrained-geometry ligand, and supported on sulfated alumina (AlS) represents the optimal combination. This system allows for the formation of a cationic active site that, depending on the reaction conditions (presence of olefin monomer vs. presence of hydrogen gas and higher temperature), can either effectively polymerize olefins or break down polyolefins into short saturated alkanes.
