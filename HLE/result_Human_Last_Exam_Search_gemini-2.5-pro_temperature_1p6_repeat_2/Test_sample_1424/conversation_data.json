    "### The Bare Green's Function's Dependence on Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship arises naturally from the formulation of the Green's function as a path integral over the exponential of the non-interacting action. In essence, the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space is inversely proportional to the frequency minus the single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n\nThe bare Green's function, also known as the free propagator, describes the propagation of a single particle in a system without interactions. In the path integral formalism, it is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. For a non-interacting system, this can be calculated exactly.\n\nThe starting point is the action for a non-interacting system, S_0, which is quadratic in the fields. After a Fourier transform from spacetime to frequency-momentum space, the action for a fermionic system can be expressed as:\n\nS_0 = ∑_{k,ω} ψ*(k,ω) (iω - ϵ_k) ψ(k,ω)\n\nHere, ψ*(k,ω) and ψ(k,ω) are the Grassmann field variables in frequency-momentum space, ω is the frequency, k is the momentum, and ϵ_k represents the single-particle energy eigenvalues, which are the eigenvalues of the non-interacting single-particle Hamiltonian, H_0.\n\nThe bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum domain, G_0(k,ω), is then obtained by performing the Gaussian path integral. The result of this integration gives the inverse of the quadratic term in the action:\n\n**G_0(k,ω) = 1 / (iω - ϵ_k)**\n\nThis expression clearly demonstrates the functional dependence: G_0(k,ω) has a simple pole at the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k in the complex frequency plane. This pole signifies the energy-momentum relationship of the free particle.\n\nTo understand the time-domain behavior, we can perform a Fourier transform of G_0(k,ω) back to the time domain. For t > 0, the time-dependent bare Green's function, G_0(k,t), is given by:\n\nG_0(k,t) = -i * e^(-iϵ_k*t)\n\nThis shows that in the time domain, the bare Green's function oscillates with a frequency determined by the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. This oscillatory behavior represents the time evolution of the quantum mechanical phase of a particle with energy ϵ_k.\n\nIn summary, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalues is a cornerstone of many-body theory. In the Feynman path integral formalism, this dependence is made explicit through the exact evaluation of the path integral for the non-interacting action, revealing a simple inverse relationship in frequency space and an oscillatory behavior in the time domain, both governed directly by ϵ_k.\n\n<<<In the frequency-momentum domain, the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) is inversely proportional to (ω - ϵ_k), often appearing as G_0(k,ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where δ is an infinitesimal quantity that ensures causality. This means G_0 has a simple pole at the single-particle energy ϵ_k. In the time domain, after a Fourier transform, G_0(k, t) for t > 0 is proportional to exp(-iϵ_k*t), showing an oscillatory dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue.>>>"
