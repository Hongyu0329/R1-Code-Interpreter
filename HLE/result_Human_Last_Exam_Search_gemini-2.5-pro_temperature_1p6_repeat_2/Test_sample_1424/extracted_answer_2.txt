In the frequency-momentum domain, the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) is inversely proportional to (ω - ϵ_k), often appearing as G_0(k,ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where δ is an infinitesimal quantity that ensures causality. This means G_0 has a simple pole at the single-particle energy ϵ_k. In the time domain, after a Fourier transform, G_0(k, t) for t > 0 is proportional to exp(-iϵ_k*t), showing an oscillatory dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue.
