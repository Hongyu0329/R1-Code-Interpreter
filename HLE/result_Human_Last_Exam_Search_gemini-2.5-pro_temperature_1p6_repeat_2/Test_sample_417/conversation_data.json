    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry is required.\n\nThe core of the molecule is a 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring. This central unit possesses a C3 axis of rotational symmetry, which means that the three large substituents attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in one of these substituents and on the central ring and then sum them up.\n\nThe proton environments can be broken down as follows:\n\n1.  **Central Mesitylene Core**:\n    *   **Methyl groups on the ring (positions 2, 4, 6):** Due to the C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** There are no aromatic protons on the central ring as it is fully substituted.\n\n2.  **Methylene Linkers (-CH2-)**:\n    *   The three methylene groups that connect the benzene ring to the indazole units are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   However, each methylene group is attached to a chiral substituent (the camphor-derived indazole). This makes the two protons within each methylene group diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. They will have different chemical shifts and will likely split each other into a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). This contributes two distinct signals to the spectrum.\n\n3.  **One Substituent Group ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)**:\n    *   This part of the molecule is derived from camphor. An analysis of related structures and general principles of NMR for such bicyclic systems is helpful.\n    *   **Indazole Proton (H3):** The indazole ring has one proton at the C3 position. This gives one signal.\n    *   **Camphor Skeleton Protons**:\n        *   **H4 (bridgehead):** This single proton is in a unique environment and will produce one signal.\n        *   **H5 (methylene):** The two protons at the C5 position are diastereotopic (endo and exo) and are therefore non-equivalent, giving two signals.\n        *   **H6 (methylene):** Similarly, the two protons at the C6 position are also diastereotopic and will result in two signals.\n    *   **Methyl Groups on the Camphor Skeleton**:\n        *   **C7-Methyl:** The methyl group at the C7 bridgehead is unique and will produce one signal.\n        *   **C8-Methyls:** The two methyl groups at the C8 position are geminal and diastereotopic due to the overall chirality of the molecule. They are non-equivalent and will give two separate signals.\n\n**Summary of the Signals:**\n\n*   Aromatic CH3 groups: 1 signal\n*   Linker CH2 protons: 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n*   Indazole C3-H: 1 signal\n*   Camphor skeleton C4-H: 1 signal\n*   Camphor skeleton C5-H2: 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n*   Camphor skeleton C6-H2: 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n*   Camphor skeleton C7-CH3: 1 signal\n*   Camphor skeleton C8-(CH3)2: 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **12 signals**.\n\nEach signal corresponds to a unique proton environment in the molecule. Due to the molecule's C3 symmetry, the signals for the three identical substituent arms overlap perfectly, so we only count the signals from one arm plus those from the central core.\n\n<<<H>>>"
