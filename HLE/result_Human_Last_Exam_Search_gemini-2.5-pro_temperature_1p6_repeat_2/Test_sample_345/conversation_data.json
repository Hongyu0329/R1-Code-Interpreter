    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Nationalgalerie, part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\n\"The Radionist,\" also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (The Radio Addict / Petit Bourgeois by the Radio), is a notable work of the New Objectivity movement. The painting, created with tempera on wood, measures 55 x 49 cm. It is inventoried under the number A IV 134.\n\nThe artwork portrays a man, identified as a certain Herr Schreck who was a paraplegic and lived in Günther's house, listening to the radio. The painting is seen as a commentary on the burgeoning radio culture of the 1920s and its societal impact.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
