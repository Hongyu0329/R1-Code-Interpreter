    "The probability of finding a particle in a one-dimensional box in a specific interval is determined by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval. For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wavefunction for the n=2 state is:\n\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the wavefunction.\n\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a, we must integrate the probability density function over this range.\n\nThe integral to be solved is:\nP = ∫ from 0.495a to 0.505a of (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2, the integral becomes:\nP = (1/a) * ∫ from 0.495a to 0.505a of (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n\nSolving this definite integral yields:\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nEvaluating this expression at the limits gives:\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\nThe final calculated probability is approximately:\nP ≈ 0.00000658 or 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThis extremely low probability is expected. For the n=2 state, there is a node (a point of zero probability) at the exact center of the box, x = 0.5a. The specified interval is a very small region centered on this node.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
