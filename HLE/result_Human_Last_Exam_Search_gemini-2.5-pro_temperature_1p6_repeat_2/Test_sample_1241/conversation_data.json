    "To solve the given boundary-value problem, we first analyze the system of equations to find the stationary probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, which we will denote as $P_i$. The stationary state is reached as $t \\to +\\infty$, at which point the probabilities are constant, and their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are equal to zero.\n\n### System of Equations\nThe given system is:\n1. $P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n2. $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n3. $P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n4. $P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\nWith the condition:\n5. $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\n\nThe values of the coefficients are:\n* $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n* $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n* $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n* $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n* $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n* $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\n### Analysis of the System\nThis system is presented as a Kolmogorov-Chapman system, which typically describes a continuous-time Markov chain. In such systems, the sum of the derivatives of the probabilities over all states should be zero, reflecting that the total probability is conserved. Let's check this condition for the given system.\n\nSumming the derivatives:\n$P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3' = P_0(-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01}) + P_1(\\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{12} + \\lambda_{12}) + P_2(\\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{23} + \\lambda_{23}) + P_3(\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31})$\n$P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3' = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$\n\nSince this sum is not zero, the total probability $P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3$ is not constant, which contradicts the condition that it must equal 1 for all time. This indicates a likely typographical error in the second equation. In a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman formulation, the term representing the flow from state 0 to state 1 in the equation for $P_1'(t)$ should be positive. Therefore, we assume the second equation is meant to be:\n$P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\n### Finding the Stationary Probabilities\nWith the corrected system, we now set the derivatives to zero to find the stationary probabilities $P_i$:\n1. $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2. $0 = 0.019 P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3$\n3. $0 = 0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2$\n4. $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\nAnd the normalization condition:\n5. $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nFrom these equations, we can find the relationships between the probabilities:\n* From equation (4): $0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$.\n* From equation (3): $0.4 P_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) P_2 \\implies 0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$.\n* Combining these, we get $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n* From equation (1): $0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (5) to solve for the individual probabilities. We substitute $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right) P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$P_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNext, we calculate $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\n### Calculation of the Final Value\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$.\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nPerforming the final division:\n$P_0 + P_1 \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nRounding to five decimal places, the value is 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
