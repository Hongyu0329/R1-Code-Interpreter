    "An American in Paris, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, was the first film to hold that title to depict the Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The musical, starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, features an extended ballet sequence set in a stylized recreation of Paris.\n\nThis elaborate finale, inspired by the paintings of French artists, includes a scene set in the Place de la Concorde, the Parisian square where the Luxor Obelisk is located. While much of the film was shot on MGM studio lots, detailed sets of famous Parisian landmarks were constructed, including a replica of the fountain from the Place de la Concorde which serves as a central element in the ballet. Gene Kelly's character dances across this recreated square, and the sequence is designed to evoke the atmosphere of various Parisian locations, with the Place de la Concorde being a key feature.\n\nOther Best Picture winners have been set in Paris, including *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) and *Gigi* (1958). However, *The Life of Emile Zola*, a biographical drama, does not feature the Place de la Concorde as a prominent location. *Gigi*, which also won Best Picture and was filmed on location in Paris, was released seven years after *An American in Paris*. No evidence suggests that a Best Picture winner has ever featured the other Luxor Obelisk, which remains in Luxor, Egypt.\n\nTherefore, the vibrant and artistically-rendered Parisian setting of *An American in Paris* secures its place as the first Best Picture winner to feature a depiction of the iconic Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<*An American in Paris*>>>"
