    "Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002, and it continues to be the rarest. Oganesson, a synthetic element, does not occur naturally and therefore has a terrestrial abundance of virtually zero.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring noble gases, radon is exceptionally scarce due to its radioactivity and short half-life. Its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. This means it decays quickly after being formed from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust.\n\nHere's a comparison of the abundances of noble gases:\n\n*   **Radon (Rn):** The abundance of radon in the Earth's crust is estimated to be about 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. Its concentration in the atmosphere is even lower, at approximately 1 x 10⁻¹⁹ percent.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** As the rarest of the stable noble gases, xenon is found in the Earth's atmosphere at a concentration of about 0.087 parts per million. In the Earth's crust, its abundance is about 1.5 x 10⁻³ milligrams per kilogram.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The Earth's atmosphere contains about 1 part per million of krypton, and its abundance in the crust is around 1 x 10⁻⁴ milligrams per kilogram.\n*   **Helium (He):** While being the second most abundant element in the universe, on Earth it is much rarer. Its concentration in the atmosphere is about 5 parts per million.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The atmosphere contains about 18 parts per million of neon.\n*   **Argon (Ar):** Argon is the most abundant noble gas on Earth, making up about 0.934% of the atmosphere by volume.\n\nThe abundances of these gases are the result of long-term geological and atmospheric processes and would not have been significantly different in 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
