    "Until 1950, the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome was distinguished by a unique wooden cobblestone pavement. This feature was removed by the city administration that year due to safety concerns.\n\nThe wooden paving blocks, known as \"sanpietrini in legno,\" were the subject of numerous complaints from the public. The sloping surface of the square, combined with a grease coating required to preserve the wood, made the pavement slippery and led to frequent falls.\n\nFollowing the removal of the wooden cobblestones, the piazza was repaved with traditional stone \"sanpietrini.\" A few of the original wooden blocks were preserved and donated to the Salesian Convent in Castro Pretorio, where they were repurposed for a driveway.\n\nPrior to this, other architectural elements had been removed from the square, including market stalls in 1823 and an iron railing that surrounded the fountain in 1928. However, the removal of the wooden cobblestones in 1950 represents a distinct change to the piazza's character, driven by practical considerations of public safety.\n\n<<<The wooden cobblestone pavement>>>"
