    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Parnassus**.\n\nMount Olympus, famously known as the home of the gods in Greek mythology, stands as the highest peak in Greece at 2,917 meters (9,570 feet). While it is the most prominent mountain in the epic, other notable peaks are also mentioned.\n\nThe second tallest among these is Mount Parnassus, with an elevation of 2,457 meters (8,061 feet). Its inclusion in the geography of the *Iliad* is noted through references to the ancient communities that resided on and around it.\n\nAnother significant mountain in the *Iliad* is Mount Ida in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), which has a height of 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). The gods, particularly Zeus, are often depicted on its summit, observing the events of the Trojan War.\n\nAlso mentioned is Mount Pelion in Thessaly, which has a height of 1,624 meters. It is referenced in the context of Achilles' formidable spear, which was crafted from an ash tree on its peak.\n\nTherefore, based on their respective elevations, Mount Parnassus is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
