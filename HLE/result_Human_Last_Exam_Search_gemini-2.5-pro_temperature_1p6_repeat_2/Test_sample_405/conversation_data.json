    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least five distinct colors: white, yellow, red, violet, and black.\n\nThe most common allotropes of phosphorus are white and red. White phosphorus is a translucent waxy solid that becomes yellow when exposed to light. Therefore, it can be observed as both white and yellow.\n\nRed phosphorus has a dark red color. Another allotrope, violet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a distinct crystalline form with a violet color. Finally, black phosphorus, the most thermodynamically stable form, is black and flaky with a metallic luster, similar in appearance to graphite.\n\nIn recent years, other allotropes have been synthesized, including blue phosphorus. However, the name \"blue phosphorus\" is derived from its wider band gap compared to black phosphorus, and it is a two-dimensional material that was first synthesized in 2016. There is limited information about the observable color of a bulk sample of this allotrope.\n\nBased on the well-established and commonly observed allotropes, there are five distinct colors.\n\n<<<5>>>"
