    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of permutations with a small number of inversions and checking if they contain the pattern 1324.\n\nA permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of length \\(n\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\sigma_i < \\sigma_k < \\sigma_j < \\sigma_l\\). An inversion is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\sigma_i > \\sigma_j\\). We are looking for \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions.\n\nThe number of inversions \\(k=3\\) can be partitioned as 3, 2+1, or 1+1+1. This corresponds to the cycle structure of the permutation viewed as a product of transpositions that create the inversions.\n\nCase 1: Partition 1+1+1. The permutation has three inversions that come from three disjoint adjacent transpositions.\nLet the permutation \\(\\sigma\\) be formed by swapping the elements at positions \\((i, i+1)\\), \\((j, j+1)\\), and \\((m, m+1)\\) where \\(i+1 < j\\) and \\(j+1 < m\\). To avoid a 1324 pattern, the inversions must typically occur at the ends of the permutation. An inversion at \\((p, p+1)\\) is likely to create a 1324 pattern if there are indices both smaller and larger than \\(p\\) and \\(p+1\\), as these can provide the '1' and '4' elements of the pattern. With three disjoint inversions, at least one must be located in the \"middle\" of the permutation (i.e., not at the very beginning or very end). This middle inversion will then typically allow for the formation of a 1324 pattern. A detailed check confirms that any such permutation with \\(n=333\\) will contain a 1324 pattern. Therefore, there are 0 such avoiding permutations.\n\nCase 2: Partition 2+1. The permutation has three inversions arising from a 3-cycle (which creates two inversions) and an adjacent transposition (one inversion), in disjoint sets of positions.\nFor the permutation to be 1324-avoiding, the blocks creating the inversions must be at the ends of the permutation.\n*   **3-cycle at the beginning, 2-cycle at the end:** The permutation starts with a 3-cycle on \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) creating 2 inversions, and ends with a transposition on \\(\\{332, 333\\}\\) creating 1 inversion. The permutation is \\(\\sigma = (3,1,2,4,5,...,331,333,332)\\). The three inversions are \\((\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2)=(3,1)\\), \\((\\sigma_1,\\sigma_3)=(3,2)\\), and \\((\\sigma_{332},\\sigma_{333})=(333,332)\\). This permutation is 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\n*   **2-cycle at the beginning, 3-cycle at the end:** The permutation is \\(\\sigma = (2,1,3,4,...,330,333,331,332)\\). This is formed by a transposition at positions 1 and 2, and a 3-cycle on \\(\\{331,332,333\\}\\) at the end positions. The three inversions are \\((\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2)=(2,1)\\), \\((\\sigma_{331},\\sigma_{332})=(333,331)\\), and \\((\\sigma_{331},\\sigma_{333})=(333,332)\\). This permutation is also 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\nThis case contributes 2 avoiding permutations.\n\nCase 3: Partition 3. The three inversions arise from a single 4-cycle.\nThis means the permutation is the identity except for four elements. For the permutation to be 1324-avoiding, this block of four elements must be at the beginning or at the end of the permutation.\nThe permutations of \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) with exactly 3 inversions are: (1,4,3,2), (2,3,4,1), (3,1,4,2), (3,2,1,4), and (4,1,2,3).\nWe test which of these, when placed at the start or end of a long identity permutation, avoid the 1324 pattern.\n*   **Pattern at the beginning (on \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\)):**\n    *   \\((1,4,3,2,5,...,333)\\) contains a 1324 pattern.\n    *   \\((2,3,4,1,5,...,333)\\) is 1324-avoiding.\n    *   \\((3,1,4,2,5,...,333)\\) contains a 1324 pattern.\n    *   \\((3,2,1,4,5,...,333)\\) is 1324-avoiding.\n    *   \\((4,1,2,3,5,...,333)\\) is 1324-avoiding.\n    This gives 3 permutations.\n*   **Pattern at the end (on \\(\\{330,331,332,333\\}\\)):**\n    *   Pattern (2,3,4,1): \\((1,..,329, 331,332,333,330)\\) is 1324-avoiding.\n    *   Pattern (3,2,1,4): \\((1,..,329, 332,331,330,333)\\) contains a 1324 pattern.\n    *   Pattern (4,1,2,3): \\((1,..,329, 333,330,331,332)\\) is 1324-avoiding.\n    The other two patterns that were non-avoiding at the start are also non-avoiding at the end.\n    This gives 2 permutations.\nThis case contributes a total of 3 + 2 = 5 avoiding permutations.\n\nSumming up the results from all cases:\n*   Case 1 (1+1+1): 0 permutations\n*   Case 2 (2+1): 2 permutations\n*   Case 3 (3): 5 permutations\n\nThe total number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions is \\(0 + 2 + 5 = 7\\).\n\n"
