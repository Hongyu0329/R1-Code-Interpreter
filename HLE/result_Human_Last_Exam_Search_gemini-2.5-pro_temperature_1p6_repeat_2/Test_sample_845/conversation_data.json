    "The value computed as the time between heartbeats when tracking Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is most commonly called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhen using an electrocardiogram (ECG), this is specifically referred to as the **R-R interval**, which is the time elapsed between two successive R-waves of the QRS complex on the ECG signal. However, since you are using Photoplethysmography (PPG), the term **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI)** is also used to describe the time between consecutive pulse waves.\n\nFor the purpose of HRV analysis, it's common to filter out any irregular heartbeats (artifacts or ectopic beats), and the resulting intervals between normal-to-normal beats are then referred to as **NN intervals**.\n\nTherefore, while several terms exist, **Interbeat Interval (IBI)** is a broadly accurate and widely used term for the value between heartbeats used to compute HRV.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)>>>"
