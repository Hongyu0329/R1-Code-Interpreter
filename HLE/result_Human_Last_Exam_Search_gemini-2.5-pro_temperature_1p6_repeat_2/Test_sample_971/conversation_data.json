    "In a 2008 performance of the *Don Quixote* ballet with the Bolshoi Ballet, Natalia Osipova, in the role of Kitri, performed a sequence of 16 single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position during her Act I variation.\n\nThis particular series of turns is a challenging and iconic part of the choreography for Kitri's first act solo. While the number of pirouettes can vary slightly between productions and individual performances, video documentation of Osipova's interpretation from that period confirms her execution of 16 consecutive single turns. This feat showcases the exceptional technique and stamina for which she is celebrated.\n\n<<<16>>>"
