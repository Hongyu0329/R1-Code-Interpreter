    "When N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide undergoes a reaction, first with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, the resulting compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of a directed *ortho*-metalation (DoM). Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical transformation:\n\n1.  **Directed *ortho*-Metalation**: The first step involves the deprotonation of an aromatic C-H bond that is positioned *ortho* (adjacent) to a directing metalation group (DMG). In the starting material, there are two such groups: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) at position C1 and the N,N-dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position C3.\n2.  **Hierarchy of Directing Groups**: The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is a significantly more powerful directing group than the N,N-dimethylamino group. The organolithium reagent, `sec`-BuLi, which is a very strong base, is made even more reactive by the addition of TMEDA, which chelates the lithium ion.\n3.  **Regioselectivity**: The powerful N,N-diethylcarboxamide group directs the deprotonation to one of its adjacent positions, C2 or C6. The N,N-dimethylamino group directs to its adjacent positions, C2 and C4. The C2 position is *ortho* to both directing groups. When multiple directing groups are present, metalation preferentially occurs at the site that is activated by both, leading to the selective removal of the proton at the C2 position by the `sec`-BuLi/TMEDA complex. This forms a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate.\n4.  **Electrophilic Quench**: In the second step, methyl iodide (CH₃I) is introduced. The carbanion of the aryllithium intermediate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching the methyl group to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\nThe final product of this two-step sequence is therefore N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
