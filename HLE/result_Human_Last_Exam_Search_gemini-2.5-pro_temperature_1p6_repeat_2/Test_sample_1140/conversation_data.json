    "For the synthesis of a 100-amino-acid peptide containing the unnatural amino acid azido phenylalanine, the most helpful technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nDirectly synthesizing a peptide of this length using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is challenging. While possible with modern optimized methods, it often results in low yields and difficult purification due to the accumulation of deletion and truncated sequences. The efficiency of each coupling step is critical, and even a small inefficiency gets compounded over 100 cycles, making the synthesis of a pure 100-residue peptide problematic. Some specialized equipment and techniques, like microwave-assisted SPPS, can improve success rates for peptides up to around 100 amino acids, but it remains a significant challenge.\n\nNative Chemical Ligation (NCL) offers a more robust and efficient strategy. This technique involves a \"convergent\" approach:\n\n1.  **Fragment Synthesis:** The 100aa target peptide is broken down into two or more smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa peptides). These shorter fragments can be synthesized with high purity using standard Fmoc-based SPPS.\n2.  **Incorporation of Azido Phenylalanine:** The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, can be readily incorporated into one of these smaller fragments during its SPPS using a commercially available protected form (e.g., Fmoc-L-azido-phenylalanine).\n3.  **Ligation:** The purified, unprotected peptide fragments are then joined together in solution. The classic NCL reaction requires one peptide fragment to have a C-terminal thioester and the other to have an N-terminal cysteine. These groups react specifically and efficiently in an aqueous solution at neutral pH to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n4.  **Ligation Site:** The partial sequence you provided, `...KAVCLXV...`, contains a cysteine (C) residue, making it a suitable candidate for a ligation site. The peptide could be synthesized as two fragments: one ending in `...KAVC-thioester` and the other beginning with `LXV...A` (requiring a method to ligate at a non-cysteine residue or a different strategy). More ideally, the peptide would be split just before the cysteine residue. For example, a fragment `M...KAV-thioester` and a fragment starting with `CLXV...A` would ligate perfectly via standard NCL.\n\nIn summary, by dividing the synthesis into smaller, more manageable parts, NCL bypasses the length limitations of direct SPPS and provides a much more reliable path to obtaining the desired full-length 100aa peptide with the correctly incorporated unnatural amino acid.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
