    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8.\n\nTo determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions, we first need to find the number of functions for each atom (Carbon and Hydrogen) in the 6-31G basis set.\n\nFor each Carbon atom, the 6-31G basis set uses:\n*   One contracted function for the 1s core orbital (this is a single function).\n*   For the valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals), it's a split-valence basis set. This means it uses two functions for each valence orbital.\n    *   One contracted function for the inner part of the 2s and 2p orbitals (composed of 3 primitive Gaussians).\n    *   One contracted function for the outer part of the 2s and 2p orbitals (composed of 1 primitive Gaussian).\n\nSo, for each carbon atom, we have:\n*   1s: 1 function\n*   2s: 2 functions (inner and outer)\n*   2p: 2 functions for each of the three p-orbitals (px, py, pz), totaling 2 * 3 = 6 functions.\n*   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 functions.\n\nFor each Hydrogen atom, the 6-31G basis set uses:\n*   For the 1s orbital, it's a split-valence representation.\n    *   One contracted function for the inner part.\n    *   One contracted function for the outer part.\n*   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 2 functions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total for toluene (C7H8):\n*   7 Carbon atoms * 9 functions/Carbon = 63 functions\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms * 2 functions/Hydrogen = 16 functions\n*   Total contracted Gaussian functions = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\nA calculation for methanol (CH4O) using the 6-31G basis set results in 26 basis functions. Let's verify this with our per-atom function count:\n*   Carbon: 9 functions\n*   Hydrogen: 4 * 2 = 8 functions\n*   Oxygen: 9 functions (same as Carbon)\n*   Total for Methanol: 9 + 8 + 9 = 26 functions. This confirms our per-atom counts.\n\nTherefore, for toluene (C7H8):\n*   7 Carbon atoms: 7 * 9 = 63 functions\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 * 2 = 16 functions\n*   Total = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
