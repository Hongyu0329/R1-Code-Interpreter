    "A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup of the form G<sup>k</sup> = ⟨g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G⟩ for some integer k. To determine the number of distinct power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group of size 128, Q<sub>128</sub>, we first need to understand its structure and the behavior of powers of its elements.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q<sub>128</sub> can be defined by the presentation:\nQ<sub>128</sub> = ⟨a, x | a<sup>64</sup> = 1, x<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>, xax<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup>⟩\n\nThe elements of Q<sub>128</sub> consist of two types: those in the cyclic subgroup generated by 'a', which is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 64 (C<sub>64</sub>), and those outside of this subgroup. Specifically, the elements are {a<sup>i</sup> | 0 ≤ i < 64} and {xa<sup>i</sup> | 0 ≤ i < 64}.\n\nWe analyze the k-th powers of these elements:\n*   For elements of the form a<sup>i</sup>, the k-th power is (a<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = a<sup>ik</sup>.\n*   For elements of the form xa<sup>i</sup>, their order is 4, since (xa<sup>i</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>, and (a<sup>32</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>64</sup> = 1. The center of Q<sub>128</sub> is Z(Q<sub>128</sub>) = {1, a<sup>32</sup>}, which is a subgroup of order 2. The behavior of (xa<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> depends on k modulo 4:\n    *   If k ≡ 1 (mod 4), (xa<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = xa<sup>i</sup>.\n    *   If k ≡ 2 (mod 4), (xa<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>.\n    *   If k ≡ 3 (mod 4), (xa<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>xa<sup>i</sup>.\n    *   If k ≡ 0 (mod 4), (xa<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = 1.\n\nNow, we can determine the power subgroups G<sup>k</sup> for G = Q<sub>128</sub>:\n\n**Case 1: k is odd**\nIf k is odd, then gcd(k, 64) = 1, which means the map a<sup>i</sup> ↦ a<sup>ik</sup> is a bijection on the subgroup ⟨a⟩. Thus, the set of k-th powers of elements in ⟨a⟩ generates ⟨a⟩ itself.\n*   If k is odd, the set of k-th powers {g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G} will generate the entire group G. For instance, if k is odd, the set of k-th powers contains ⟨a⟩ and elements like xa<sup>i</sup> or a<sup>32</sup>xa<sup>i</sup>, which together with ⟨a⟩ generate Q<sub>128</sub>.\nThis means for any odd integer k, **G<sup>k</sup> = Q<sub>128</sub>**. This gives us our first power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: k is even**\nThis case is further divided based on k modulo 4.\n\n*   **k ≡ 2 (mod 4):** In this case, (xa<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = a<sup>32</sup> for all i. The k-th powers of the elements a<sup>i</sup> generate ⟨a<sup>gcd(k, 64)</sup>⟩. Since k = 2(2m+1) for some integer m, we have gcd(k, 64) = 2. So, G<sup>k</sup> = ⟨a<sup>2</sup>, a<sup>32</sup>⟩. As a<sup>32</sup> is a power of a<sup>2</sup>, this simplifies to **G<sup>k</sup> = ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩**, which is a cyclic subgroup of order 32 (C<sub>32</sub>). This gives our second distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **k ≡ 0 (mod 4):** In this case, (xa<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = 1 for all i. Thus, G<sup>k</sup> is generated only by the k-th powers of the elements in ⟨a⟩, which is ⟨a<sup>gcd(k, 64)</sup>⟩. Since k is a multiple of 4, gcd(k, 64) will be a multiple of 4 that divides 64. The possible values for gcd(k, 64) are 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. This yields the following distinct subgroups:\n    *   **⟨a<sup>4</sup>⟩**, a cyclic subgroup of order 16 (C<sub>16</sub>).\n    *   **⟨a<sup>8</sup>⟩**, a cyclic subgroup of order 8 (C<sub>8</sub>).\n    *   **⟨a<sup>16</sup>⟩**, a cyclic subgroup of order 4 (C<sub>4</sub>).\n    *   **⟨a<sup>32</sup>⟩**, a cyclic subgroup of order 2 (C<sub>2</sub>).\n    *   **⟨a<sup>64</sup>⟩ = {1}**, the trivial subgroup.\n\nIn summary, the distinct power subgroups of Q<sub>128</sub> are:\n1.  Q<sub>128</sub> (the group itself)\n2.  ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩ (isomorphic to C<sub>32</sub>)\n3.  ⟨a<sup>4</sup>⟩ (isomorphic to C<sub>16</sub>)\n4.  ⟨a<sup>8</sup>⟩ (isomorphic to C<sub>8</sub>)\n5.  ⟨a<sup>16</sup>⟩ (isomorphic to C<sub>4</sub>)\n6.  ⟨a<sup>32</sup>⟩ (isomorphic to C<sub>2</sub>)\n7.  {1} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we find there are a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
