    "Had the Norse never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **\"suster\"** or **\"soster\"**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is, in fact, a product of the linguistic mixing that occurred during the Viking Age. The original Old English, or Anglo-Saxon, word for a female sibling was **\"sweostor\"**. There were also regional variations like \"swuster\". These native forms are related to other Germanic words for the same concept, such as the German \"Schwester\" and the Dutch \"zuster\".\n\nFollowing the Norman Conquest, \"sweostor\" evolved into the Middle English form **\"suster\"**. However, extensive contact with Old Norse speakers, who used the word **\"systir\"** for sister, began to influence the English pronunciation. The \"i\" sound in the modern word \"sister\" is a direct result of this Scandinavian influence.\n\nWithout the Norse invasions, the native word would have followed its own evolutionary path. The Middle English \"suster\" would likely have continued into Modern English, possibly retaining its spelling or undergoing a sound change that might have resulted in a form like \"soster.\" Therefore, the most probable modern equivalent would be a direct descendant of the original Anglo-Saxon term.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
