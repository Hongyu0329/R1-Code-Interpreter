    "There are exactly **13** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA complete classification of finite groups containing these specific sets has been achieved, with the work of Anabanti and Hart proving that any such group must have an order of at most 24. Their research completed the classification for sets of size 3, building upon earlier work by Giudici and Hart for sets of sizes 1 and 2.\n\nThe paper \"Locally maximal product-free sets of size 3\" by Anabanti and Hart provides a comprehensive list of these groups and the corresponding product-free sets. The groups are:\n\n*   **Cyclic groups:** C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C18, C20, C24\n*   **The Alternating Group:** Alt(4)\n\nThis comprehensive enumeration confirms that there is a finite and determined number of such groups.\n\n<<<13>>>"
