    "The island town in question is **Hanga Roa**.\n\nLocated on Easter Island, a Chilean territory, Hanga Roa is one of the most remote inhabited places in the world. The nearest inhabited landmass is Pitcairn Island, which is approximately 2,088 kilometers away, well exceeding the 500-kilometer requirement.\n\nThe town of Hanga Roa sits on the west coast of the island along Hanga Roa Bay. The name \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"wide bay\" or \"long bay\" in the Rapa Nui language. The entire island is of volcanic origin, composed of three main extinct volcanoes: Terevaka, Poike, and the prominent Rano Kau, which features a large caldera. Hanga Roa itself is situated in the lowlands between the Terevaka and Rano Kau volcanoes. While Hanga Roa Bay is not a perfectly enclosed caldera in the way some other volcanic islands feature, its coastline and the surrounding landscape were shaped by the island's volcanic activity, with the town lying at the foot of the Rano Kau volcano and its significant caldera.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
