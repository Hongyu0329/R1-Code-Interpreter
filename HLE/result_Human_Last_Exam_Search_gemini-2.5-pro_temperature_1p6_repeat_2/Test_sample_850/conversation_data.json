    "There are no achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity. This is due to the fundamental symmetry requirements for these properties, which are mutually exclusive.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasons:\n\n**Optical Activity:** For a crystal to be optically active, it must be chiral. This means its crystal structure must lack both a center of symmetry (inversion center) and any mirror planes. In essence, the crystal's structure and its mirror image are not superimposable. Of the 32 crystal classes, the 21 that are non-centrosymmetric are a prerequisite for optical activity.\n\n**Achiral Crystal Classes:** An achiral crystal possesses symmetry elements of the second kind, which include an inversion center or a mirror plane. The presence of these symmetry elements means the crystal's structure is superimposable on its mirror image, and thus it cannot be optically active.\n\n**Non-Polar Crystal Classes:** A crystal class is considered non-polar if it is centrosymmetric, meaning it has a center of symmetry. There are 11 such centrosymmetric and achiral crystal classes. The presence of an inversion center inherently makes a crystal achiral and, therefore, optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the defining characteristic of an optically active crystal is chirality. Conversely, achiral and non-polar crystal classes are defined by symmetry elements (mirror planes and inversion centers) that explicitly prevent chirality. Therefore, a crystal class cannot simultaneously be achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\nThe crystal classes can be categorized as follows:\n*   **Centrosymmetric and Achiral (Non-polar):** These 11 classes have an inversion center and are not optically active.\n*   **Non-centrosymmetric and Chiral:** These 11 classes lack an inversion center and mirror planes, and they are optically active.\n*   **Non-centrosymmetric and Achiral:** These 10 classes lack an inversion center but have mirror planes, making them achiral and thus not optically active.\n\n<<<There are no achiral and non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity.>>>"
