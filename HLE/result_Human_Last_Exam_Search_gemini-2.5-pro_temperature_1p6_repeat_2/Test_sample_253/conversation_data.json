    "When applying the cellular automaton Rule 110 starting from a single cell in state 1 (represented as a single black cell or \"1\" in a field of \"0\"s) for 20 iterations, the following binary pattern is generated: `11011100011110110111`.\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton where the state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The rule is named for the binary representation of the output of the eight possible neighbor patterns, which is 01101110 in binary, or 110 in decimal. The rules for determining the next state of the central cell are as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern | New State for Center Cell |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nStarting with a single '1' at generation 0, the pattern evolves with each time step. The evolution of Rule 110 can produce complex and seemingly chaotic patterns from simple initial conditions, a characteristic of what is known as Class 4 behavior.\n\nHere is a step-by-step evolution for the first few generations:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `1`\n*   **Generation 1:** `11`\n*   **Generation 2:** `111`\n*   **Generation 3:** `1101`\n*   **Generation 4:** `11111`\n*   **Generation 5:** `110001`\n\nContinuing this process for 20 generations results in the final binary pattern.\n\n<<<11011100011110110111>>>"
