    "The reaction between 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and excess phenyl magnesium bromide is a Grignard reaction, which is a powerful tool for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reactivity of aryl halides in such reactions is crucial for predicting the outcome.\n\nThe key steps in the reaction are:\n*   **Reactant Analysis**: The starting material is 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, a benzene ring with three different halogen substituents. The reagent is phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent), which acts as a nucleophile, providing a phenyl group.\n*   **Chemoselectivity**: Grignard reagents react with aryl halides with a distinct order of reactivity. The carbon-halogen bond strength decreases in the order C-F > C-Cl > C-Br > C-I. Consequently, the reactivity increases down the group. For aryl halides, the reactivity order is I > Br > Cl.\n*   **Stepwise Substitution**:\n    1.  The phenyl magnesium bromide will first react at the most reactive site, which is the carbon-iodine bond. The iodine atom is replaced by a phenyl group to form 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n    2.  Since an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide is used, the reaction continues. The phenyl nucleophile will then replace the two bromine atoms.\n*   **Final Product**: After all three halogen atoms are substituted by phenyl groups, the resulting molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent phenyl substituents. This compound is known as 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n*   **Aqueous Work-up**: The final step involves an aqueous work-up, which serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent and to hydrolyze the magnesium halide byproducts, allowing for the isolation of the stable organic product, 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the final product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
