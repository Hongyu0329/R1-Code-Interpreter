    "The search results provide a lot of information on quadratic forms over integers and over fields, but specific classifications over rings like Z/nZ are noted to be more complex, especially for n being a power of 2.\n\nResult is the most direct and promising. It's a response on a math forum where a user has performed computer experiments to classify quadratic forms over Z/nZ for various n and dimensions (rank). The notation `R=Z/mZ` and `d=k` is used for the ring and the number of variables (rank), respectively.\n\nLet's examine the entry for R = Z/8Z, which is `R=Z/23Z` in the post's notation.\nThe post provides the number of classes for `d=1`, `d=2`, and `d=3`.\nThe question asks for the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables, which corresponds to `d=2`.\n\nAccording to the post, for `R=Z/2^3Z = Z/8Z` and `d=2` (rank 2, i.e., two variables), there are **32** equivalence classes.\n\nThe post seems reliable within the context of computational exploration. While a formal proof is not provided, the systematic listing for various rings and ranks suggests a thorough computational approach.\n\nThe result is given as:\nFor R=Z/2^3Z=Z/8Z\nd=1 (8 classes)\nd=2 (32 classes)\nd=3 (128 classes for p=2, but the author notes some complexity and lists 136 for R=Z/2^3Z in a different section, suggesting potential nuances in the computation or classification criteria).\n\nThe number for d=2 appears to be stated unequivocally as 32. I will rely on this specialized computational result, as a full theoretical derivation is beyond the scope of a general search and would involve deep theory of quadratic forms over local rings.\n\nFinal check on the source: The author of the post seems knowledgeable, referencing relevant literature and providing a detailed account of their methodology. While not a peer-reviewed paper, it is a strong piece of evidence for a specific numerical answer. The author has also made their code available for verification.\n\nThe classification of quadratic forms over Z/p^kZ is a known but complicated topic. For p=2, it is notoriously more difficult than for odd primes. The number of classes depends on the rank of the form (number of variables).\n\nI am confident enough in the result from source to provide the answer. No further searching seems likely to yield a more direct or reliable answer without delving into highly specialized academic literature that is unlikely to be available through general web search.\nThe search result directly addresses the classification of quadratic forms over rings of the form `Z/p^nZ`, including the specific case `Z/8Z` (`p=2, n=3`).\n\nFor `R = Z/8Z` (`Z/2^3Z`), the search result states that for `d=2` (which corresponds to quadratic forms in two variables), there are 32 equivalence classes. This information appears to be the result of a computational analysis. The author of the source has run computer calculations to classify these forms and has listed the number of equivalence classes for different rings and different numbers of variables (d).\n\nThe number of classes listed for `R=Z/2^3Z` and `d=2` is 32.\n\nTherefore, based on this source, there are 32 equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the finite ring R = Z/8Z.\n\n<<<32>>>"
