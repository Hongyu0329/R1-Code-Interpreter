    "The provided sequence of numbers is:\n1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352\n\nUpon analysis, it is evident that all the numbers in the sequence are divisible by 6. A search of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) for this sequence does not yield a match, which suggests that it is not a standard, well-known mathematical sequence.\n\nTo find the next number, let's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n*   1020 - 1014 = 6\n*   1032 - 1020 = 12\n*   1050 - 1032 = 18\n*   1104 - 1050 = 54\n*   1224 - 1104 = 120\n*   And so on.\n\nThe sequence of differences is irregular and does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. Further analysis, such as examining the differences of the differences or the sequence of the sum of the digits of each number, also fails to reveal a clear, predictable pattern.\n\nThe only consistent property of the sequence is that every number is a multiple of 6. The last term is 2352. The next multiple of 6 after 2352 is 2358. While the provided sequence is a specific selection of multiples of 6 and not a simple arithmetic progression, without a discernible rule for this selection, the most logical inference is to continue the most basic pattern present.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is likely the next multiple of 6.\n\n2352 + 6 = 2358\n\n<<<2358>>>"
