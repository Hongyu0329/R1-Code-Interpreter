    "A power subgroup is a cyclic subgroup, meaning it is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. The number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as `SD_512`, is 201.\n\nThe semidihedral group `SD_{2^n}` is a non-abelian group of order `2^n`. For `SD_512`, the order is `2^9`, so `n=9`. The number of cyclic subgroups, `c(SD_{2^n})`, can be calculated with the formula:\n\n`c(SD_{2^n}) = n + 3 * 2^(n-3)`\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, we have `n=9`. Plugging this into the formula gives:\n\n`c(SD_512) = 9 + 3 * 2^(9-3)`\n`c(SD_512) = 9 + 3 * 2^6`\n`c(SD_512) = 9 + 3 * 64`\n`c(SD_512) = 9 + 192`\n`c(SD_512) = 201`\n\nThis total can be broken down by analyzing the structure of the group:\n*   The group `SD_512` contains a cyclic subgroup of order 256. This cyclic subgroup has 9 of its own subgroups (equal to the number of divisors of 256).\n*   There are 128 elements of order 2 which are not in the aforementioned cyclic subgroup. Each of these generates a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n*   There are also 128 elements of order 4. These elements generate 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nSumming these up: `9 + 128 + 64 = 201`.\n\n<<<201>>>"
