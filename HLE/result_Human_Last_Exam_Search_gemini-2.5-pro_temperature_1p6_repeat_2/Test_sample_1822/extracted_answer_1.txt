This question cannot be answered with a numerical value as it relies on a non-existent or proprietary formula that combines concepts from disparate fields of AI fairness and graph theory. The conflicting evidence (c=0.85 vs. c'=0.78) and the confounding structural factor (Î²=0.23) make a simple calculation of an evidence ratio impossible.
