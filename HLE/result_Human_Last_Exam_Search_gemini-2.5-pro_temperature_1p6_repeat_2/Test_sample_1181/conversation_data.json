    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of Dr. Snaut who expresses a longing for the sound of rustling leaves on Earth and suggests a way to simulate it.\n\nOn the sterile and psychologically taxing space station orbiting the planet Solaris, the remaining scientists grapple with loneliness and a profound sense of disconnection from their home world. In a conversation with the newly arrived psychologist Kris Kelvin, Dr. Snaut remarks on this feeling of loss. He tells Kelvin that one can hang strips of paper in front of an air conditioning unit to create a sound reminiscent of rustling leaves. This attempt to replicate a simple, natural sound from Earth highlights the deep-seated homesickness and alienation experienced by the crew.\n\nAccording to the film's script, the idea for this simulation was originally Gibarian's. It is also mentioned that the deeply analytical and stern Dr. Sartorius secretly has one in his closet. Even the protagonist, Kris, is said to have made one himself. However, it is Snaut who openly speaks about this coping mechanism, articulating the shared, unspoken nostalgia and the \"inhumane conditions\" they must endure by trying to remain human.\n\n<<<C>>>"
