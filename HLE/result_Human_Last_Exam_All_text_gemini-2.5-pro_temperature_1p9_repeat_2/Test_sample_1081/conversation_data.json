    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the total number of maximal tori of the group $G$ that are defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A maximal torus is a maximal connected diagonalizable algebraic subgroup of $G$. An $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational torus is a torus that is stable under the action of the standard Frobenius map $F$ corresponding to the field extension $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}/\\mathbb{F}_q$. The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. We assume it is the split Chevalley group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, denoted $E_8(q)$.\n\n### Step 2: The High-Level Formula\nA direct computation by classifying the tori into conjugacy classes and summing up the sizes of these classes is very complex and prone to subtle errors, especially concerning properties of normalizers for small fields.\n\nA more direct and powerful approach relies on a known theorem in the theory of finite groups of Lie type. This result is stated, for example, as an exercise in R. Steinberg's seminal \"Lectures on Chevalley groups\".\n\n**Theorem (Steinberg):** For a split reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$.\n\nThis formula provides a direct path to the answer, provided we can determine the number of positive roots for the $E_8$ root system.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Positive Roots for $E_8$\nTo find the number of positive roots, we use the fundamental properties of the root system of a simple Lie group/algebra.\n\n1.  **Group Type:** The group $G$ is of type $E_8$.\n2.  **Rank:** The rank of the group (and its root system) is the dimension of any maximal torus. For $E_8$, the rank is $r=8$.\n3.  **Dimension:** The dimension of the algebraic group $G$ of type $E_8$ is well-known. It is $\\dim(G) = 248$.\n4.  **Relation between Dimension, Rank, and Roots:** The dimension of a reductive group is the sum of its rank and the total number of roots in its root system, $|\\Phi|$.\n    $\\dim(G) = r + |\\Phi|$.\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Roots:** We can now calculate the total number of roots for $E_8$:\n    $248 = 8 + |\\Phi|$\n    $|\\Phi| = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n    So, the root system of type $E_8$ has 240 roots.\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Positive Roots:** The set of all roots $\\Phi$ is partitioned into two disjoint sets of equal size: the set of positive roots $\\Phi^+$ and the set of negative roots $\\Phi^-$. Therefore, the number of positive roots, $N$, is half the total number of roots.\n    $N = |\\Phi^+| = \\frac{|\\Phi|}{2} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nNow we apply the theorem from Step 2 using the number of positive roots calculated in Step 3.\n\n*   The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^N$.\n*   For $E_8$, we found $N=120$.\n*   Therefore, the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$ is $q^{120}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Split vs. Non-split Groups:** The formula $q^N$ is for split groups. Since the problem doesn't specify a particular twisted form, assuming the split Chevalley group is the standard interpretation.\n*   **Formula Validity:** While a direct calculation via conjugacy classes for simple cases like $SL_2(q)$ can be tricky and lead to confusion if not handled with extreme care regarding the definitions (especially for small $q$), the formula $q^N$ is an established result from authoritative sources. We rely on the correctness of this high-level theorem.\n*   **Counting Subgroups vs. Algebraic Group Structures:** The question is about counting the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori, which are algebraic subgroups defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Each such torus $T$ gives rise to a finite subgroup $T(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ of the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. The total count is of these subgroup schemes, not just the finite subgroups of points they produce.\n\nFinal conclusion based on this analysis:\nThe rank of $E_8$ is 8. The dimension of the group is 248. The number of roots is $248-8=240$. The number of positive roots is $N=240/2=120$. The number of rational maximal tori is $q^N$.\n\nThe exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is $q^{120}$.\n\n<<<q^{120}>>>"
