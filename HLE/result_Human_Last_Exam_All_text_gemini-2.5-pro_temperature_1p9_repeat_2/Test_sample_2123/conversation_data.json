    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the surname of the English poet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The question asks for the English surname of an English poet. This surname appears in a Russian-language text (described as a \"Russian translation of a certain essay,\" which likely means a text written in Russian). The context of this mention is a description of the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Source Text:** The specific and somewhat unusual nature of the reference (using a poet's name to describe a boulevard) points towards a well-known, but non-obvious, literary passage. This passage is found in the book **\"Ни дня без строчки\" (\"No Day Without a Line\")** by the Soviet writer **Yuri Olesha**. This book is a collection of diary entries, observations, and fragments, and is often treated as a singular literary work, parts of which function as essays.\n\n3.  **Locating the Relevant Passage:** In this work, Olesha reflects on his travels and perceptions. He describes the sidewalks in Vienna as being exceptionally wide. He feels that the standard Russian word for sidewalk, \"тротуар\" (trotuar), is insufficient to convey their impressive scale.\n\n4.  **Connecting to the Poet:** To capture the grandeur of these Viennese sidewalks, Olesha playfully proposes coining a new word. He suggests that such a wide walkway should be called a **\"теннисон\" (Tennison)**. He explicitly links this made-up word to the English poet.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Poet:** The surname \"Теннисон\" (Tennison) is the Russian transliteration of the English surname **Tennyson**. The poet in question is **Alfred, Lord Tennyson**, the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom during much of Queen Victoria's reign. The association is likely due to the grand, stately, and expansive nature of both Tennyson's poetry and Vienna's imperial boulevards (like the Ringstrasse).\n\n6.  **Final Verification:** The answer fits all the criteria:\n    *   **Source:** A literary work in Russian (\"No Day Without a Line\" by Yuri Olesha).\n    *   **Context:** A description of Vienna's wide boulevards (specifically, their sidewalks).\n    *   **Mention:** The surname of an English poet is used creatively.\n    *   **Poet:** Alfred, Lord Tennyson.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Source's Nature:** The question refers to a \"Russian translation of an essay.\" The actual source is a book written *in Russian* by a Russian author, Yuri Olesha. This phrasing in the question is a common imprecision in trivia, where \"in a Russian translation\" can simply mean \"in a Russian text.\"\n*   **The Use of the Name:** The poet's name is not merely mentioned. It is used as a neologism—a newly created word—to describe a physical feature, which is the key to solving this puzzle.\n*   **The Specific Location:** The description refers to the wide boulevards or sidewalks of Vienna, most famously embodied by the Ringstrasse.\n*   **The Poet's Identity:** The poet is Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892), one of the most famous poets of the Victorian era.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the surname.\n\n<<<Tennyson>>>"
