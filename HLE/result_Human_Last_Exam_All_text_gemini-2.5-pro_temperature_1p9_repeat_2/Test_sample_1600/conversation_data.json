    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question and define the terms.**\n\n*   **a(n):** This represents a sequence where `n` is a positive integer.\n*   **\"Number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\":** In the context of propagator corrections, \"non-vanishing\" refers to diagrams that provide a fundamental contribution to the calculation. These are the **connected, one-particle-irreducible (1PI)** diagrams. A diagram is 1PI if it cannot be cut into two separate pieces by severing a single internal line.\n*   **\"Order 2n\":** In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the fundamental interaction vertex involves two fermion lines (electron/positron) and one boson line (photon). The strength of this interaction is proportional to the elementary charge `e`. Physical quantities are calculated as a power series in the fine-structure constant, `α ∝ e²`. A diagram with `V` vertices has a contribution proportional to `e^V`. To be a power of `α`, `V` must be even. By convention in QED, a diagram of \"order 2n\" refers to a diagram with **2n vertices**. This corresponds to a contribution of order `α^n` and involves **n loops**.\n*   **\"For the electron or the photon propagators\":** This refers to self-energy diagrams, which are corrections to the propagator of a particle. A key result in QED combinatorics is that the number of 1PI self-energy diagrams of a given order is the same for the electron (a fermion) as it is for the photon (a boson).\n*   **The goal:** We need to find the value of `a(3)`.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the specific problem.**\n\nBased on the definitions above, finding `a(3)` means we need to find the number of connected, 1PI Feynman diagrams of order `2 * 3 = 6`. These diagrams will have **6 vertices** and represent the **3-loop** corrections to the electron or photon propagator.\n\n**Step 3: Consult the established results for the sequence a(n).**\n\nThe enumeration of these diagrams is a classic, but non-trivial, combinatorial problem in quantum field theory. The results are well-known and documented in standard textbooks and research literature. We do not need to derive this from scratch by attempting to draw all possible diagrams. Instead, we can list the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)`.\n\n*   **For n = 1 (Order 2):**\n    *   This corresponds to diagrams with 2 vertices (1 loop).\n    *   There is only **one** such diagram. It's the simple loop where a particle (e.g., an electron) emits and reabsorbs a virtual photon.\n    *   So, `a(1) = 1`.\n\n*   **For n = 2 (Order 4):**\n    *   This corresponds to diagrams with 4 vertices (2 loops).\n    *   A careful enumeration shows there are **two** distinct 1PI topologies.\n    *   So, `a(2) = 2`.\n\n*   **For n = 3 (Order 6):**\n    *   This corresponds to diagrams with 6 vertices (3 loops). This is the value we are asked to find.\n    *   The complete set of these diagrams was first enumerated by physicists working on higher-order corrections to QED predictions, such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.\n    *   The established result is that there are **seven** such diagrams.\n    *   So, `a(3) = 7`.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the result.**\n\nThe sequence `a(n)` for the number of `2n`-order non-vanishing QED propagator diagrams begins `1, 2, 7, 34, ...`. The question asks for the value of `a(3)`, which is the third term in this sequence.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Terminology is key:** A precise understanding of terms like \"order 2n\" and \"non-vanishing\" is crucial to correctly identify the physical and mathematical problem.\n2.  **1PI is implied:** \"Non-vanishing\" or \"primitive\" diagrams are 1PI. Reducible diagrams are just combinations of 1PI diagrams and are not counted as new fundamental topologies.\n3.  **Electron vs. Photon:** The fact that the number is the same for both electron and photon propagators simplifies the problem significantly.\n4.  **Reliance on known results:** This is a problem of knowledge retrieval, not first-principles derivation. Trying to draw and count the 7 diagrams for `a(3)` is highly prone to error for a non-expert. The reliable method is to consult authoritative sources (textbooks like Itzykson & Zuber, or scientific databases like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, sequence A002840).\n\nFollowing this step-by-step analysis, we find the value for a(3).\n\n<<<7>>>"
