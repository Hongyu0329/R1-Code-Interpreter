    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry is specified, which is a critical piece of information.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($KOC(CH_3)_3$). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol. This is the conjugate acid of the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an **E2 elimination reaction**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Stereochemistry of the E2 Reaction:**\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (in this case, the Bromine atom) and the proton being removed from an adjacent carbon must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar arrangement means the leaving group and the hydrogen must both be in **axial** positions, but on opposite faces of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down). This is often referred to as a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n\n**3. Draw the Chair Conformations of the Starting Material:**\n*   We need to determine the structure of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S,2R) configuration indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring, meaning they are *trans* to each other. For a 1,2-trans disubstituted cyclohexane, there are two possible chair conformations:\n    1.  **Diequatorial conformer:** Both the bromo group and the methyl group are in equatorial positions. This is the more stable conformer because bulky groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position.\n    2.  **Diaxial conformer:** Both the bromo group and the methyl group are in axial positions. This is the less stable conformer due to significant 1,3-diaxial strain.\n\n**4. Determine the Reactive Conformer:**\n*   The E2 reaction can only occur when the leaving group (Br) is in an axial position.\n*   Looking at the two conformers:\n    *   In the **diequatorial** conformer (the major conformer at equilibrium), the Br is equatorial. It is not anti-periplanar to any adjacent hydrogens. Therefore, **no E2 reaction can occur from this stable conformer.**\n    *   In the **diaxial** conformer (the minor, less stable conformer), the Br is axial. This conformer is able to undergo E2 elimination, provided there is an adjacent axial proton. The reaction must proceed through this high-energy conformation.\n\n**5. Identify Possible Elimination Pathways (Regiochemistry):**\n*   Let's analyze the **diaxial** conformer. The axial Bromine is at C1. We need to look for axial protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** In the diaxial conformer, the methyl group is axial. This means the hydrogen on C2 must be in the **equatorial** position. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, **elimination towards C2 cannot occur.** The product that would form, 1-methylcyclohexene (the more substituted Zaitsev product), cannot be formed via an E2 mechanism from this substrate.\n    *   **At C6:** Carbon C6 has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen** on C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base (potassium tert-butoxide) can only remove the axial proton from C6.\n\n**6. Determine the Final Product:**\n*   Since the elimination removes a proton from C6 and the bromine from C1, a double bond is formed between **C1 and C6**.\n*   The methyl group on C2 is not involved in the reaction and remains on its carbon.\n*   The resulting molecule is a cyclohexene ring where the methyl group is on the carbon adjacent to the double bond.\n*   To name this product using IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the double bond carbons the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2), and then number so the substituent gets the lowest number. This places the methyl group on carbon 3.\n*   The name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene (the Hofmann product), and its formation is dictated by the stereochemistry of the starting material, which makes the Zaitsev pathway impossible.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
