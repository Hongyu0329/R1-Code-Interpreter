    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Goal:** The primary objective is to find the \"rule activation level\" of a specific fuzzy rule.\n    *   **Context:** The system is based on \"interval type-3 fuzzy sets\" (IT3FS). This is a very advanced type of fuzzy logic system that handles a high degree of uncertainty.\n    *   **Given Data Point 1:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   **Given Data Point 2:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n    *   **Operation:** A \"t-norm operation\" is mentioned.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Components and Terminology:**\n\n    *   **Fuzzy Rule Structure:** A typical fuzzy rule (the k-th rule) has the structure:\n        `IF` (antecedent conditions are met) `THEN` (consequent actions are taken).\n        Example: `IF x is A THEN y is G`.\n\n    *   **Rule Activation Level (Φ_k(x'))**: This value, also known as the \"firing strength\" or \"firing level\", represents the degree to which the antecedent part (the \"IF\" part) of the rule is satisfied by a given input `x'`. It is calculated by applying a t-norm operator (like AND) to the membership degrees of the input in the antecedent fuzzy sets. The notation `Phi_k(x')` or `Φ_k(x')` is standard for representing this value for the k-th rule.\n\n    *   **Consequent Membership (`μG_k_j(y_j)`)**: This represents the membership degree of an output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` (the \"THEN\" part of the k-th rule). This value is used *after* the rule activation level has been determined. The activation level is used to scale or modify the consequent set to produce the rule's output fuzzy set.\n\n    *   **T-norm Operation**: This is a type of fuzzy logic operator that models the \"AND\" connective. It's used to combine the membership values in the antecedent. For example, in a rule like `IF temp is HIGH AND pressure is HIGH`, the t-norm (e.g., `min` or `product`) is used to combine `μ_HIGH(temp)` and `μ_HIGH(pressure)` to get the overall activation level for the rule.\n\n3.  **Putting it Together (Careful Points):**\n\n    *   **Point 1: Identifying the Target Quantity:** The question asks for the \"rule activation level\". The standard symbol for this is `Φ_k(x')`.\n    *   **Point 2: Analyzing the Given Information's Relevance:**\n        *   The problem explicitly states `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This means the value we are looking for is directly provided.\n        *   The information `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` pertains to the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the rule. The rule activation level depends *only* on the antecedent (the \"IF\" part). Therefore, this piece of information is extraneous and not needed to determine the activation level. It is a distractor.\n        *   The \"t-norm operation\" is the method used to *calculate* `Φ_k(x')` from the antecedent memberships. Since the final value of `Φ_k(x')` is already given, we do not need to perform any t-norm calculation. This information simply provides context about how `Φ_k(x')` would normally be computed.\n    *   **Point 3: The Role of \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\":** In a true IT3FLS, the activation level `Φ_k(x')` would not be a single number like 0.7; it would be a Type-2 fuzzy set. The problem simplifies this complex output to a single crisp number. We must accept this simplification as part of the problem statement. The core concept remains: `Φ_k(x')` is the activation level.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe question asks for the value of the rule activation level. It then provides the symbol for the rule activation level, `Phi_k(x')`, and gives its value as `0.7`. The other pieces of information (`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, t-norm, IT3FS context) are not required for the final calculation as the answer is explicitly stated within the problem's premises.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe rule activation level is given by `Phi_k(x')`.\nThe problem states that `Phi_k(x') = 0.7`.\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
