    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem provides a system of four linear first-order differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman system (specifically, the forward equations) for a continuous-time Markov process with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. We are asked to find the sum of the probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 as time goes to infinity, i.e., $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$. These are the steady-state probabilities.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nalong with the normalization condition:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nThe transition rates are given as:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points and Correction of the Equations\nA critical point of analysis is to verify the consistency of the provided equations. In the Kolmogorov forward equations, the term $\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ in the equation for $P_j'(t)$ represents the rate of probability flowing *from* state $i$ *to* state $j$, and thus should have a positive sign.\nLet's examine the equation for $P_1'(t)$:\n$$P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$$\nThe term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ suggests a flow *out* of state 1 *to* state 0. However, $\\lambda_{01}$ is defined as the rate from state 0 to state 1. Thus, this term should be positive, representing flow *into* state 1.\nFurthermore, the sum of the probabilities must be constant: $(P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3)' = 0$. Let's check the sum of the given derivatives:\n$P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3' = (- \\lambda_{01}P_0 + ...) + (- \\lambda_{01}P_0 + ...) + ...$\nThe sum of all terms on the right-hand sides is:\n$(- \\lambda_{01} + \\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{01} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + \\lambda_{12})P_0...$ = $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$, which is not zero in general.\nThis violates the condition that the total probability is conserved and equal to 1 for all $t$.\nTherefore, we must assume there is a typo in the second equation. The standard form for $P_1'(t)$ should be:\n$$P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$$\nWith this correction, the sum of derivatives becomes zero, and the system is consistent with the theory of Markov chains.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Steady-State Equations\nThe steady-state probabilities, let's denote them by $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are found when the system reaches equilibrium, which means the probabilities are no longer changing with time. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting the derivatives to zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$.\nThe corrected system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities is:\n1. $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1$\n2. $0 = 0.019 p_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) p_1 + 0.392 p_2 + 0.008 p_3$\n3. $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2$\n4. $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3$\nAnd the normalization condition:\n5. $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\n### Step 4: Solving the System of Linear Equations\nWe can express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$ using equations 1, 3, and 4.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 p_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) p_2 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_2 = p_1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_3 = p_2$. Since $p_2 = p_1$, we have $p_3 = p_1$.\n\nNow, substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$\\frac{650}{19} p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}) p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}) p_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} p_1 = 1 \\implies p_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nNow we can find $p_0$:\n$p_0 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Answer\nThe question asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, which is $p_0 + p_1$.\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nTo get a numerical value, we perform the division:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to five decimal places, the result is 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
