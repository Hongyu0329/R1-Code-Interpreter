    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher who meets three criteria:\n1.  He belongs to the **Lviv-Warsaw School** of philosophy.\n2.  He analyzed the concept of a **\"hallmark\"**.\n3.  He **decomposed** this concept into two distinct categories: **\"symptoms\"** and **\"signals\"**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key terms**\n*   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential school of logic and analytical philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (1920s-1930s). Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The search must be limited to philosophers from this specific group.\n*   **\"Hallmark\":** This is likely a translation of a specific technical term used by the philosopher. In the context of the Lviv-Warsaw School's interest in language and signs, \"hallmark\" refers to a sign or an indicator. The Polish term is most likely *oznaka*.\n*   **\"Symptoms\" and \"Signals\":** This is a semiotic distinction.\n    *   A **symptom** is a *natural sign*. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on a natural, often causal, connection. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire.\n    *   A **signal** is a *conventional* or *artificial sign*. The relationship is established by rule, agreement, or intention for the purpose of communication. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the concepts to the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nThe analysis of signs, language, and meaning (semiotics) was a central concern for many members of the Lviv-Warsaw School. We need to find which member specifically proposed the hallmark/symptom/signal framework.\n\n*   While many in the school worked on logic and language, the philosopher most famously associated with a detailed theory of signs and meaning in this particular way is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n*   Ajdukiewicz made significant contributions to semantics and the philosophy of language. He developed a detailed semiotic theory where he analyzed different kinds of signs.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the specific contribution of the philosopher**\n*   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, in his works on semiotics (like \"Język i poznanie,\" or \"Language and Knowledge\"), explicitly analyzes the concept of *oznaka* (sign/hallmark).\n*   He is known for distinguishing *oznaki* into different types, most notably **symptoms** (*symptomy*) and **signals** (*sygnały*).\n*   He defined a symptom as an event that naturally accompanies another event, allowing us to infer the second from the first.\n*   He defined a signal as a sign produced intentionally to convey a certain thought or cause a certain behavior, with its meaning based on a convention or rule of interpretation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of hallmark (*oznaka*) into symptoms and signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
