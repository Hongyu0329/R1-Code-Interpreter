The fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over Grassmann fields ψ(τ) and ψ*(τ):

Z = ∫ D[ψ*] D[ψ] e^(-S_E[ψ*, ψ])

where:
1.  **D[ψ*]D[ψ]** is the functional integration measure over all possible configurations of the Grassmann fields.
2.  **S_E[ψ*, ψ]** is the Euclidean action for the fermions, defined as:
    S_E[ψ*, ψ] = ∫_0^β dτ [ Σ_k ψ_k*(τ) ∂_τ ψ_k(τ) + H(ψ*(τ), ψ(τ)) ]
    *   `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature.
    *   `τ` is the imaginary time variable.
    *   `ψ_k(τ)` and `ψ_k*(τ)` are the Grassmann fields, with `k` indexing the degrees of freedom (e.g., momentum, spin, site).
    *   `H(ψ*(τ), ψ(τ))` is the Hamiltonian function obtained by replacing the fermionic creation (c†) and annihilation (c) operators in the normal-ordered quantum Hamiltonian with the corresponding Grassmann fields `ψ*` and `ψ`.

3.  The integral is taken over all fields that satisfy the **anti-periodic boundary condition (APBC)** in imaginary time:
    ψ_k(τ = β) = -ψ_k(τ = 0)
    ψ_k*(τ = β) = -ψ_k*(τ = 0)
This boundary condition is a direct consequence of Fermi-Dirac statistics.
