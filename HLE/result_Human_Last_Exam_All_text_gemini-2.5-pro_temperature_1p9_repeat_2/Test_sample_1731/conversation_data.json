    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the specified large deviation theorems.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Define the System and Core Principles**\n\n*   **System:** A gas of light quanta (photons) within a volume $V$ at thermal equilibrium.\n*   **Statistics:** Photons are bosons and obey Bose-Einstein statistics. A key property is that they are not conserved, which means their chemical potential in thermal equilibrium is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **Large Deviation Theory (LDT) in Statistical Mechanics:** LDT provides a framework to understand why macroscopic systems are overwhelmingly found in their equilibrium state. It states that the probability of observing a macrostate that deviates from equilibrium is exponentially small. The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the statistical entropy (or, equivalently, minimizes a rate function).\n\n**2. Approach via Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem provides the rate function for the empirical measure of i.i.d. samples. In statistical mechanics, this principle is generalized: the probability of a macroscopic state is determined by its statistical weight (number of corresponding microstates), which is directly related to its entropy.\n\n*   **Step 2a: Define Entropy for Bosons:**\n    The number of ways to distribute $n_i$ indistinguishable bosons (photons) into $g_i$ states at energy level $\\epsilon_i$ is $W_i = \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i}$. The total number of microstates for a macrostate defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$ is $W = \\prod_i W_i$.\n    The Boltzmann entropy is $S = k_B \\ln W$. Using Stirling's approximation for large $n_i$ and $g_i$, and defining the average occupation per state $\\bar{n}_i = n_i/g_i$, the entropy becomes:\n    $S/k_B = \\sum_i g_i [ (1+\\bar{n}_i)\\ln(1+\\bar{n}_i) - \\bar{n}_i \\ln \\bar{n}_i ]$\n\n*   **Step 2b: Find the Equilibrium State:**\n    According to the principles of LDT and statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the most probable one, which corresponds to the macrostate that maximizes the entropy $S$. This maximization must be done under the physical constraints of the system.\n    *   **Constraint:** For a system in contact with a heat bath, the total average energy is conserved. For the photon gas, this is the only constraint.\n        $E = \\sum_i g_i \\bar{n}_i \\epsilon_i = \\text{constant}$.\n    *   **Maximization:** We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S/k_B - \\beta (E - E_{const})$. Differentiating with respect to $\\bar{n}_j$ and setting the result to zero gives:\n        $\\ln(\\frac{\\bar{n}_j+1}{\\bar{n}_j}) - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n    *   **Equilibrium Distribution:** Solving for $\\bar{n}_j$ yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons ($\\mu=0$):\n        $\\bar{n}_{eq}(\\epsilon_j) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n    Here, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the Lagrange multiplier identified as the inverse temperature.\n\n**3. Approach via Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem describes the large deviations of a sample mean. Its application in this context is through the canonical ensemble formulation, where it affirms that the equilibrium energy of the system is overwhelmingly likely to be the average energy of the ensemble.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Canonical Ensemble:**\n    In the canonical ensemble, the system's energy fluctuates, and the probability of finding the system with energy $E$ is proportional to $W(E) e^{-\\beta E}$, where $W(E)$ is the number of states with energy $E$ and $\\beta=1/k_B T$ is fixed by the heat bath.\n*   **Step 3b: Finding the Equilibrium Value:**\n    The most probable energy is the one that maximizes the probability function $P(E)$, or equivalently its logarithm, $\\ln W(E) - \\beta E$. Recalling $S(E) = k_B \\ln W(E)$, this is equivalent to maximizing $S(E)/k_B - \\beta E$. The condition for the maximum is $\\frac{1}{k_B}\\frac{dS}{dE} - \\beta = 0$, which means the system's microcanonical temperature $T_{sys} = (\\frac{dS}{dE})^{-1}$ must equal the bath temperature $T$.\n*   **Conclusion:** This confirms that the equilibrium state corresponds to the canonical average. Therefore, both the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff approaches lead to the same conclusion: the equilibrium properties of the photon gas are found by averaging over the Bose-Einstein distribution derived in Step 2.\n\n**4. Calculation of Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe mean energy $E$ is calculated by integrating the energy of each state, $\\epsilon$, multiplied by its average occupation number, $\\bar{n}_{eq}(\\epsilon)$, over the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$.\n\n*   **Step 4a: Density of States for Photons:**\n    For photons in a 3D box of volume $V$, considering two polarization states, the density of states is:\n    $g(\\epsilon) = \\frac{8\\pi V \\epsilon^2}{h^3 c^3}$\n*   **Step 4b: Integration:**\n    $E = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\epsilon \\cdot \\bar{n}_{eq}(\\epsilon) \\cdot g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\cdot \\frac{8\\pi V \\epsilon^2}{h^3 c^3} d\\epsilon$\n    $E = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n    By substituting $x = \\beta \\epsilon$, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{1}{\\beta^4}\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n*   **Step 4c: Final Result for Mean Energy:**\n    $E = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15\\beta^4} = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V}{15 h^3 c^3} (k_B T)^4$\n    This is the celebrated Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**5. Calculation of Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy can be found using the thermodynamic relation for a system with zero chemical potential: $S = (E + pV)/T$.\n\n*   **Step 5a: Equation of State for Photon Gas:**\n    For a relativistic gas like photons, the pressure $p$ is related to the energy density $u=E/V$ by $p = u/3$. Thus, $pV = E/3$.\n*   **Step 5b: Entropy Calculation:**\n    Substituting $pV=E/3$ into the thermodynamic relation gives:\n    $S = \\frac{E + E/3}{T} = \\frac{4E}{3T}$\n*   **Step 5c: Final Result for Entropy:**\n    Substituting the expression for the equilibrium energy $E$:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V T^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\n### **Summary of Careful Points**\n*   The chemical potential for photons in thermal equilibrium is zero because their number is not conserved.\n*   Both LDT theorems justify the use of statistical mechanical methods (maximizing entropy or finding the canonical average) to determine the equilibrium state.\n*   The final values are not constants but functions of temperature ($T$) and volume ($V$).\n*   The calculation relies on the correct density of states for photons, including the factor of 2 for polarization.\n*   The simple relations $p=u/3$ and $S=4E/3T$ are specific to the ultra-relativistic photon gas and greatly simplify the entropy calculation.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium value of the mean energy is:\n$E_{eq} = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V T^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\n\nThe equilibrium value of the entropy is:\n$S_{eq} = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\n<<<Mean Energy: $E = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V T^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$, Entropy: $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$>>>"
