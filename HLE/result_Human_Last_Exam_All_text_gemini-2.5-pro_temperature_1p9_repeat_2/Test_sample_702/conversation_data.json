    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map**\n\n*   The source space is $X = \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   The target space is $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n*   We use the standard identification $S^p \\wedge S^q \\cong S^{p+q}$, so the target space is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" suggests that the map $f$ is the inclusion of the fiber in a known fibration sequence. There is a standard fibration sequence in homotopy theory (related to James-Hopf invariants, the EHP sequence, or recognition principles for loop spaces) given by:\n    $$ \\Sigma(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\xrightarrow{f} \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n) \\xrightarrow{g} \\Omega(S^{m+1} \\wedge S^{n+1}) $$\n    For our problem, $m=4$ and $n=6$. Let's call the three spaces in the sequence $X, Y, Z$.\n    $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n    $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$\n    $Z = \\Omega(S^{4+1} \\wedge S^{6+1}) = \\Omega(S^5 \\wedge S^7) = \\Omega S^{12}$\n    So, we have a fibration sequence:\n    $$ X \\xrightarrow{f} Y \\xrightarrow{g} Z $$\n\n**Step 2: Define connectivity of a map**\n\nA map $f: X \\to Y$ is called $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$. To find the connectivity of $f$, we can analyze the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the fibration $X \\to Y \\to Z$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the connectivity of the spaces X, Y, and Z**\n\nThe connectivity of a space $A$ is the largest integer $c$ such that $\\pi_i(A)=0$ for all $i \\le c$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^k$**: The loop space $\\Omega S^k$ is $(k-2)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2) = 2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2) = 4$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of a smash product**: The smash product of a $p$-connected space and a $q$-connected space is $(p+q+1)$-connected.\n    *   The space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2 + 4 + 1) = 7$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of a suspension**: The suspension of a $p$-connected space is $(p+1)$-connected.\n    *   The source space $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of target and base spaces**:\n    *   The target space $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$-connected.\n    *   The base space $Z = \\Omega S^{12}$ is $(12-2) = 10$-connected.\n\nSummary of connectivities:\n*   $X$ is 8-connected ($\\pi_i(X)=0$ for $i \\le 8$).\n*   $Y$ is 8-connected ($\\pi_i(Y)=0$ for $i \\le 8$).\n*   $Z$ is 10-connected ($\\pi_i(Z)=0$ for $i \\le 10$).\n\n**Step 4: Use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups**\n\nThe fibration $X \\xrightarrow{f} Y \\xrightarrow{g} Z$ gives rise to a long exact sequence:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_i(X) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_i(Y) \\xrightarrow{g_*} \\pi_i(Z) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_{i-1}(X) \\to \\dots $$\n\n*   **For $i < 10$**: Since $Z$ is 10-connected, $\\pi_i(Z)=0$ for $i \\le 10$. For $i < 10$, we also have $\\pi_{i-1}(Z)=0$. The long exact sequence contains the segment:\n    $$ \\dots \\to \\pi_i(Z) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(X) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_{i-1}(Y) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(Z) \\to \\dots $$\n    For $i \\le 10$, this becomes:\n    $$ \\dots \\to 0 \\to \\pi_{i-1}(X) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_{i-1}(Y) \\to 0 \\to \\dots $$\n    This exact sequence implies that $f_*: \\pi_{i-1}(X) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(Y)$ is an isomorphism for $i-1 \\le 9$. Thus, $f_*$ is an isomorphism for all dimensions up to 9.\n\n*   **For $i = 10$**: We need to check if $f_*: \\pi_{10}(X) \\to \\pi_{10}(Y)$ is a surjection. The relevant part of the long exact sequence is:\n    $$ \\pi_{10}(X) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_{10}(Y) \\xrightarrow{g_*} \\pi_{10}(Z) $$\n    Since $Z$ is 10-connected, $\\pi_{10}(Z) = 0$. Therefore, the map $g_*$ must be the zero map. By exactness, the image of $f_*$ must equal the kernel of $g_*$. Since $g_*$ is the zero map, its kernel is the entire domain, $\\pi_{10}(Y)$.\n    So, $Im(f_*) = \\ker(g_*) = \\pi_{10}(Y)$. This means that $f_*$ is surjective on $\\pi_{10}$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the connectivity of the map**\n\nWe have shown that the map $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$ is:\n*   An isomorphism for $i \\le 9$.\n*   A surjection for $i = 10$.\n\nAccording to the definition, the connectivity of the map $f$ is 10.\n\n**(Optional) Why is the connectivity not 11?**\nFor $f$ to be 11-connected, $f_*: \\pi_{10}(X) \\to \\pi_{10}(Y)$ would need to be an isomorphism. Let's look at the long exact sequence again:\n$$ \\pi_{11}(Z) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_{10}(X) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_{10}(Y) $$\nExactness implies that $ker(f_*) = im(\\partial)$. For $f_*$ to be injective (and hence an isomorphism), the boundary map $\\partial$ must be the zero map. The domain of $\\partial$ is $\\pi_{11}(Z) = \\pi_{11}(\\Omega S^{12}) = \\pi_{12}(S^{12}) = \\mathbb{Z}$. This boundary map is a generalized James-Hopf invariant, and it is known to be non-zero in this context. Since $\\partial$ is not the zero map, $ker(f_*)$ is non-trivial, so $f_*$ is not injective on $\\pi_{10}$. Therefore, the map is not 11-connected.\n\nFinal answer is 10.\n\n>>>10"
