    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Basic setup and constraints\nA category consists of objects, morphisms, composition, and identity morphisms.\n*   **Objects**: We have 2 objects. Let's call them `A` and `B`.\n*   **Morphisms**: We have a total of 4 morphisms.\n*   **Identity Morphisms**: Every object must have an identity morphism. So, we must have `id_A: A → A` and `id_B: B → B`. These are 2 of the 4 morphisms.\n*   **Remaining Morphisms**: This leaves 2 \"non-identity\" morphisms to be placed in the four possible Hom-sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`.\n\n### Step 2: Classification by Hom-set sizes\nWe can classify all possible categories by the number of morphisms in each Hom-set. Let `n_XY = |Hom(X, Y)|`. The tuple of sizes is `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)`.\nThe constraints on this tuple are:\n1.  `n_AA ≥ 1` and `n_BB ≥ 1` (due to identity morphisms).\n2.  `n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 4` (total number of morphisms).\n\nTwo categories, C and C', are isomorphic if there is a functor `F: C → C'` that is full, faithful, and bijective on objects. This means an isomorphism can relabel the objects. If we swap `A` and `B`, a category with the size tuple `(a, b, c, d)` becomes one with `(d, c, b, a)`. We only need to count categories for one representative from each such equivalence class of tuples.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing each case\n\nWe enumerate the non-isomorphic tuples `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)` that satisfy the constraints.\n\n**Case 1: Morphisms are only endomorphisms** (`n_AB=0, n_BA=0`)\nThe tuple must be `(n_AA, 0, 0, n_BB)` with `n_AA + n_BB = 4`.\n*   **Subcase 1.1: `(3, 0, 0, 1)`**. (This is equivalent to `(1, 0, 0, 3)` by swapping A and B).\n    *   `Hom(A, A)` is a set of 3 morphisms including `id_A`. For composition to be defined and associative, `Hom(A, A)` must form a **monoid of order 3**.\n    *   `Hom(B, B)` just contains `id_B`.\n    *   Up to isomorphism, there are **5** distinct monoids of order 3. Each defines a valid and distinct category.\n    *   **Count: 5**\n\n*   **Subcase 1.2: `(2, 0, 0, 2)`**.\n    *   `Hom(A, A)` and `Hom(B, B)` must both be **monoids of order 2**.\n    *   There are two non-isomorphic monoids of order 2:\n        1.  The cyclic group `Z_2` (let's call it `G`), where the non-identity element `f` satisfies `f∘f = id`.\n        2.  The idempotent monoid (let's call it `S`), where the non-identity element `f` satisfies `f∘f = f`.\n    *   The possible pairs of monoids for `(Hom(A,A), Hom(B,B))` are (G, G), (G, S), (S, G), and (S, S).\n    *   The pair (G, S) is isomorphic to (S, G) by swapping objects A and B.\n    *   So, we have 3 non-isomorphic categories: (G, G), (G, S), and (S, S).\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n**Case 2: One morphism between distinct objects** (`n_AB + n_BA=1`)\nThe tuple has `n_AA + n_BB = 3`. This gives `(2,1)` or `(1,2)` for `(n_AA, n_BB)`.\n*   **Subcase 2.1: `(2, 1, 1, 0)`**. (Not isomorphic to its swap `(0, 1, 1, 2)`, which is invalid anyway).\n    *   `Hom(A, A)` is a monoid of order 2 (G or S). Let the non-identity be `f`.\n    *   `Hom(A, B)` has one morphism, `g`. `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`.\n    *   We must define the composition `g ∘ f : A → B`. This must be `g` as it's the only morphism in `Hom(A, B)`.\n    *   Associativity (`g ∘ (f ∘ f) = (g ∘ f) ∘ f`) must hold. `g ∘ (f∘f) = g ∘ f = g`. Both M2 structures (G and S) for `Hom(A,A)` satisfy this.\n    *   Since there are 2 choices for the monoid on `A`, we have 2 distinct categories.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Subcase 2.2: `(2, 0, 1, 1)`**.\n    *   `Hom(A, A)` is M2 (G or S), with non-identity `f`. `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n    *   Composition `f ∘ g : B → A` must be `g`. Associativity `(f ∘ f) ∘ g = f ∘ (f ∘ g)` holds for both choices of M2.\n    *   This gives 2 more categories. These are not isomorphic to the previous 2 because the pattern of connections is different (an arrow `A->B` vs `B->A`, which can't be reconciled by isomorphism as `A` is the object with 2 endomorphisms in both cases).\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   Other tuples like `(1, 2, 1, 0)` are isomorphic to `(2, 1, 0, 1)` by swapping A and B.\n\n**Case 3: Two morphisms between distinct objects** (`n_AB + n_BA=2`)\nThe tuple has `n_AA + n_BB = 2`, so `n_AA=1` and `n_BB=1`.\n*   **Subcase 3.1: `(1, 2, 0, 1)`**. (Its swap is `(1, 0, 2, 1)`).\n    *   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`. `Hom(A, B) = {f, g}`.\n    *   There are no non-identity morphisms that can be composed. Associativity is trivially satisfied.\n    *   There is only one such category structure.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **Subcase 3.2: `(1, 1, 1, 1)`**.\n    *   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`. `Hom(A, B) = {f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n    *   Compositions are forced:\n        *   `g ∘ f : A → A` must be `id_A`.\n        *   `f ∘ g : B → B` must be `id_B`.\n    *   This structure describes the case where objects A and B are isomorphic, with `f` and `g` being inverse isomorphisms. This is a unique, valid structure.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally\nSumming the counts from all non-isomorphic cases:\n*   Case 1.1 `(3,0,0,1)`: 5\n*   Case 1.2 `(2,0,0,2)`: 3\n*   Case 2.1 `(2,1,1,0)`: 2\n*   Case 2.2 `(2,0,1,1)`: 2\n*   Case 3.1 `(1,2,0,1)`: 1\n*   Case 3.2 `(1,1,1,1)`: 1\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories = 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
