    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(4), where a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function with n binary inputs and one binary output. It can be represented by a set of minterms for which the function's value is TRUE (or 1). These minterms correspond to vertices on an n-dimensional hypercube.\n*   **Implicant:** A product term (like `xy'`, `x'yz`, etc.) that covers a set of minterms. If an implicant is TRUE, the function must also be TRUE. Geometrically, an implicant corresponds to a subcube (e.g., a point, an edge, a face) on the hypercube.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that is \"maximal\". This means it cannot be simplified by removing a variable and still remain an implicant for the same function. Geometrically, it's a subcube of TRUE vertices that is not contained within any larger subcube of TRUE vertices.\n*   **a(n):** We are looking for the maximum possible number of prime implicants that any single Boolean function of n variables can have. We need to find this number for n=4, which is denoted as a(4).\n\n### Step 2: Strategy - Constructing Candidate Functions\n\nTo find the maximum, a common approach is to construct specific types of functions that are known to generate a large number of prime implicants and then compare the results. Two main families of functions are good candidates.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Candidate Function Family 1: The \"Middle Weight\" Function\n\nThis type of function is defined as being TRUE only for minterms that have a specific number of '1's in their binary representation. This number is called the \"weight\" of the minterm.\n\n*   **Construction:** Let's define a function $F_k$ of n variables that is TRUE for all minterms of weight k, and FALSE otherwise.\n*   **Counting Prime Implicants:** For the function $F_k$, a minterm `m` (a 0-dimensional subcube) can only be part of a larger implicant (a k-dimensional subcube, k>0) if it can be combined with adjacent minterms. An adjacent minterm to `m` has a weight of either k-1 or k+1. Since $F_k$ is only true for minterms of weight k, no adjacent minterm is TRUE. Therefore, no minterm can be combined with another, meaning every single minterm of $F_k$ is itself a prime implicant.\n*   **Maximization:** The number of PIs for this function is the number of minterms of weight k, which is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k). To get the most PIs from this family, we must choose k to maximize C(n, k). This occurs when k is as close to n/2 as possible, i.e., $k = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.\n*   **Calculation for n=4:**\n    *   The optimal weight is k = floor(4/2) = 2.\n    *   The maximal number of PIs for this family of functions is C(4, 2).\n    *   C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (4 * 3) / 2 = 6.\n    *   So, this construction yields a function with **6** prime implicants. This gives us a lower bound: a(4) ≥ 6.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Candidate Function Family 2: The Parity Function\n\nThis function is defined based on the parity (even or odd) of the weight of its minterms. This creates a \"checkerboard\" pattern on the hypercube.\n\n*   **Construction:** Let's define a function $F_{even}$ that is TRUE for all minterms with an even weight (weights 0, 2, 4 for n=4). Alternatively, we can use the complement, $F_{odd}$, which is TRUE for minterms with odd weight (weights 1, 3 for n=4). A function and its complement have the same number of prime implicants.\n*   **Counting Prime Implicants:**\n    *   Consider any minterm `m` for which $F_{even}$ is TRUE. Its weight is even.\n    *   Any adjacent minterm `m'` must have a weight that differs by exactly 1. Therefore, the weight of `m'` must be odd.\n    *   By definition, $F_{even}$ is FALSE for `m'`.\n    *   This means no minterm `m` where $F_{even}$ is TRUE is adjacent to any other minterm where $F_{even}$ is also TRUE.\n    *   Geometrically, no two TRUE vertices on the hypercube share an edge.\n    *   Consequently, each TRUE vertex forms a prime implicant by itself, as it cannot be grouped into a larger subcube of TRUE vertices.\n*   **Maximization:** The number of prime implicants is simply the total number of TRUE minterms. For any n, the number of minterms with even weight is equal to the number of minterms with odd weight, and each is half of the total number of minterms ($2^n$). So, the number of PIs is $2^n / 2 = 2^{n-1}$.\n*   **Calculation for n=4:**\n    *   The number of PIs for the parity function is $2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8$.\n    *   The minterms are those of weight 0, 2, and 4. The counts are C(4,0) + C(4,2) + C(4,4) = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8.\n    *   This construction yields a function with **8** prime implicants. This gives a better lower bound: a(4) ≥ 8.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  We have analyzed two major families of functions that are candidates for having the maximal number of prime implicants.\n2.  The \"middle weight\" function for n=4 gives 6 prime implicants.\n3.  The \"parity\" (or checkerboard) function for n=4 gives 8 prime implicants.\n4.  Since we have constructed a function with 8 PIs, we know that the maximum number, a(4), must be at least 8.\n5.  This is a well-known problem in switching theory. It has been established that for n=4, the maximum is indeed 8. No other construction for n=4 variables yields more than 8 prime implicants.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The number of prime implicants is not the same as the number of minterms.\n*   The function that gives the maximal number of PIs is not necessarily obvious; it requires careful construction and analysis.\n*   While simple formulas might exist for certain classes of functions (like $C(n, n/2)$ or $2^{n-1}$), the true maximum a(n) might be given by a different construction, especially for larger n. For n=4, however, the $2^{n-1}$ construction is optimal.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
