    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System and Question**: The problem asks for the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ associated with the specific heat ($C \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}$) for a system in spatial dimension $d=3$. The method to be used is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, a cornerstone of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory.\n\n2.  **Define the Epsilon Expansion Framework**: The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative method used to calculate critical exponents as a power series in the parameter $\\epsilon = d_u - d$.\n    *   $d$ is the spatial dimension of the system.\n    *   $d_u$ is the upper critical dimension, above which the critical exponents take their mean-field theory values. For the class of models under consideration (described by a $\\phi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian), the upper critical dimension is $d_u = 4$.\n\n3.  **Calculate $\\epsilon$ for the given dimension**:\n    *   The problem states the spatial dimension is $d=3$.\n    *   The upper critical dimension is $d_u=4$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\epsilon = d_u - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally an asymptotic series valid for $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Using it for $\\epsilon=1$ is an extrapolation, but it is a standard technique that provides a reasonable first approximation for exponents in 3D.\n\n4.  **Identify the Universality Class**: Critical exponents are universal, meaning they depend on fundamental properties like system dimensionality and the symmetry of the order parameter, but not on the microscopic details of the Hamiltonian. The number of components of the order parameter, denoted by $n$, characterizes this symmetry.\n    *   $n=1$: Ising model (scalar order parameter)\n    *   $n=2$: XY model (e.g., superfluids)\n    *   $n=3$: Heisenberg model (e.g., isotropic ferromagnets)\n    *   **Careful Point**: Since the problem does not specify the model, the standard convention is to assume the simplest and most common case, the **Ising model**, which corresponds to $n=1$.\n\n5.  **Use a Scaling Relation**: Critical exponents are not all independent and are related by scaling laws. The hyperscaling relation connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension $d$:\n    $2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n    We can rearrange this to express $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\nu$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\n6.  **Recall the Epsilon Expansion for the Exponent $\\nu$**: The one-loop RG calculation for the n-component vector model yields the following expression for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ to first order in $\\epsilon$:\n    $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    Here, $1/2$ is the mean-field value for $\\nu$.\n\n7.  **Derive the Epsilon Expansion for $\\alpha$**: To find the expansion for $\\alpha$, we substitute the expansion for $\\nu$ and the expression for the dimension $d=4-\\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation. It is crucial to substitute for $d$ as well to maintain consistency in the expansion order.\n    $\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon)\\nu$\n    $\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)\\right)$\n    Expanding the product and keeping only terms up to order $\\epsilon$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 4\\left(\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\right)\\epsilon - \\epsilon\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = -\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    By finding a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n    $\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{(n+8) - 2(n+2)}{2(n+8)}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{n+8 - 2n - 4}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    This simplifies to the final expression for $\\alpha$ to first order in $\\epsilon$:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    **Careful Point**: Note that for the mean-field theory (where $\\epsilon=0$), $\\alpha=0$. A non-zero value indicates a divergence or cusp in the specific heat, a key feature of non-trivial critical behavior.\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Numerical Answer**: We now substitute the values corresponding to the 3D Ising model into our first-order result:\n    *   $n=1$ (for the Ising model)\n    *   $\\epsilon=1$ (for $d=3$)\n    Plugging these values in:\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{3}{2(9)} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThus, the first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion predicts that the specific heat exponent for the 3D Ising model is approximately 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
