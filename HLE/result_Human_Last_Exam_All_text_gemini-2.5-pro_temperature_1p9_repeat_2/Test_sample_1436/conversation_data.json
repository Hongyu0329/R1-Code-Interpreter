    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify the Diagram Topology\n\nThe question asks for the symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram with the following characteristics:\n*   **Two vertices:** These are points where interactions occur.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In this context, a contraction is represented by a propagator line connecting fields.\n\nGiven that there are only two vertices and no external lines are mentioned, the four contractions must be propagators that connect the two vertices. Let's call the vertices V1 and V2. This means there are four separate lines running from V1 to V2. This type of diagram is a vacuum diagram (no external legs) and appears, for example, at the second order of perturbation theory in a scalar $\\phi^4$ theory, where each vertex has four lines emerging from it.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Concept of a Symmetry Factor (S)\n\nIn perturbative calculations, we expand an exponential which leads to factorials like `1/n!` in the Dyson series. When we apply Wick's theorem to generate diagrams, we produce a combinatorial number of ways to form a specific diagram topology. The symmetry factor, `S`, is the number that corrects for this overcounting. It is defined as the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, which means it's the number of ways you can permute the diagram's components (lines and vertices of the same type) while leaving the diagram's overall connectivity (topology) unchanged. The final contribution of the diagram in the expansion is proportional to `1/S`.\n\n### Step 3: Identify and Count the Symmetries of the Diagram\n\nWe need to find all the permutation operations that leave our diagram (two vertices connected by four lines) looking identical.\n\n1.  **Symmetry from Permuting Propagators (Lines):**\n    *   The diagram has four identical propagator lines connecting vertex V1 to vertex V2.\n    *   These four lines are indistinguishable from each other. Therefore, they can be permuted in any way without changing the diagram.\n    *   The number of ways to arrange four distinct items is given by the factorial 4!.\n    *   Contribution to S from lines = 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.\n\n2.  **Symmetry from Permuting Vertices:**\n    *   The two vertices, V1 and V2, are of the same type (i.e., they represent the same interaction term).\n    *   Therefore, we can swap the labels of the two vertices, and the diagram remains topologically identical (it still shows two vertices connected by four lines).\n    *   The number of ways to permute two items is 2!.\n    *   Contribution to S from vertices = 2! = 2 × 1 = 2.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the number of ways each independent symmetry operation can be performed.\n\n*   S = (Symmetry from permuting lines) × (Symmetry from permuting vertices)\n*   S = 4! × 2!\n*   S = 24 × 2\n*   S = 48\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe symmetry factor associated with a Feynman diagram featuring two vertices connected by four field contractions is 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
