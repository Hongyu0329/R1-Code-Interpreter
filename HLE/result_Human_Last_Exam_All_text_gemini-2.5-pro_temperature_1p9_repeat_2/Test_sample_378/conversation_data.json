    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find a specific year in which Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan made a public act of identifying himself with the name \"Azikiwe\". This phrasing implies that he was previously known by another name and then made a change or a special announcement.\n\n**Step 2: Factual Verification of the Name**\nThe first and most critical point to verify is the name itself. Research into the biography of the former Nigerian President reveals that his full, given birth name is **Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan**. \"Azikiwe\" is not a name he adopted or a title he took on later in life; it is an integral part of his birth name.\n\n**Step 3: Examine his Public and Political Career**\nGoodluck Jonathan's political career began to gain national prominence when he became the Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State in 1999. In all official capacities, records, and public appearances since then, he has been referred to by his full name. This includes his tenure as:\n*   Governor of Bayelsa State (2005-2007)\n*   Vice President of Nigeria (2007-2010)\n*   President of Nigeria (2010-2015)\n\n**Step 4: Address the Premise of the Question**\nThe question is based on a flawed premise. It assumes that there was a point in time when he was not known as \"Azikiwe\" and then chose to publicly identify with that name. Since \"Azikiwe\" has always been part of his legal and publicly used name, there was no single event or year where he had to \"identify himself\" as such. It has been part of his public identity from the beginning of his notable career.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Assumption vs. Fact:** The primary careful point is to distinguish the user's assumption (that he *started* using the name) from the fact (it's his birth name).\n*   **No \"Adoption\" Event:** There is no historical record of him adopting, revealing, or adding the name \"Azikiwe\" at a later date. Any search for such an event would yield no results because it never happened.\n*   **Consistent Identity:** His public identity and official name have remained consistent throughout his time in the public eye.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the event described in the question never occurred. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan has always had \"Azikiwe\" as part of his given name and has used it consistently throughout his public life. Therefore, a specific year cannot be provided.\n\n<<<There is no record of a specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" because that has always been part of his given name and has been used throughout his entire public career. The premise that he began using the name at a specific point in time is incorrect.>>>"
