    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Relate the given product to a full infinite product**\n\nThe given product starts from $n=3$. Let's relate it to the corresponding product that starts from $n=1$. Let $P$ be the desired product.\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\nThe full product is:\n$$ P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\nWe can write $P_{full}$ as the product of the first two terms (for $n=1$ and $n=2$) and the rest of the terms (which is $P$).\n$$ P_{full} = \\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right) \\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right) \\left(\\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ P_{full} = (1-z^3)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right) P $$\nFrom this, we can express $P$ in terms of $P_{full}$:\n$$ P = \\frac{P_{full}}{(1-z^3)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)} $$\nTo find $P$, we first need to evaluate $P_{full}$.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the full infinite product using the Gamma function**\n\nA general formula for such products, derived from the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function, is:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x^k}{n^k}\\right) = \\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega^j x)} $$\nwhere $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/k}$ are the k-th roots of unity.\n\nFor our problem, we have $k=3$, so $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is the principal cube root of unity. The three cube roots of unity are $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$. Applying the formula with $x=z$ and $k=3$:\n$$ P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the expression for the full product into the equation for P**\n\nSubstituting the result from Step 2 into the expression for $P$ from Step 1:\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the expression using properties of the Gamma function**\n\nWe will use the fundamental recurrence relation of the Gamma function: $\\Gamma(x+1) = x\\Gamma(x)$.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the term involving $(1-z^3)$. We use the factorization of a difference of cubes based on the roots of unity: $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a-\\omega b)(a-\\omega^2 b)$.\nFor $a=1$ and $b=z$, we have $1 - z^3 = (1-z)(1-\\omega z)(1-\\omega^2 z)$.\nLet's group the terms in the denominator of $P$:\nDenominator of $P = \\left( (1-z)(1-\\omega z)(1-\\omega^2 z) \\right) \\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right) \\left( \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z) \\right)$\nCombine the factors with their corresponding Gamma functions:\n- $(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\Gamma(1-z+1) = \\Gamma(2-z)$\n- $(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z) = \\Gamma(1-\\omega z+1) = \\Gamma(2-\\omega z)$\n- $(1-\\omega^2 z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z) = \\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z+1) = \\Gamma(2-\\omega^2 z)$\n\nSubstituting these back into the denominator simplifies the expression for $P$:\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right) \\Gamma(2-z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the expression further**\n\nLet's work with the remaining factor in the denominator, $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)$.\nFirst, rewrite it as $\\frac{8-z^3}{8}$.\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{\\frac{8-z^3}{8} \\cdot \\Gamma(2-z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega^2 z)} = \\frac{8}{(8-z^3) \\Gamma(2-z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nNow, use the factorization for $8-z^3=2^3-z^3$:\n$$ 8-z^3 = (2-z)(2-\\omega z)(2-\\omega^2 z) $$\nThe denominator of $P$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} \\times ( (2-z)(2-\\omega z)(2-\\omega^2 z) ) \\times ( \\Gamma(2-z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega^2 z) ) $$\nAgain, we group terms and use the Gamma function recurrence relation $\\Gamma(x+1)=x\\Gamma(x)$:\n- $(2-z)\\Gamma(2-z) = \\Gamma(2-z+1) = \\Gamma(3-z)$\n- $(2-\\omega z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega z) = \\Gamma(2-\\omega z+1) = \\Gamma(3-\\omega z)$\n- $(2-\\omega^2 z)\\Gamma(2-\\omega^2 z) = \\Gamma(2-\\omega^2 z+1) = \\Gamma(3-\\omega^2 z)$\nSubstituting these into the denominator of the expression for $P$:\nDenominator of $P = \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ \\Gamma(3-z)\\Gamma(3-\\omega z)\\Gamma(3-\\omega^2 z) \\right]$\nSo, the full expression for $P$ is:\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{8} \\Gamma(3-z)\\Gamma(3-\\omega z)\\Gamma(3-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter simplification, the final expression for the infinite product is:\n$$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{8}{\\Gamma(3-z)\\Gamma(3-\\omega z)\\Gamma(3-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function and $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3} = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is the principal cube root of unity.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n1.  **Starting index:** The product starts from $n=3$, so the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$ must be divided out from the standard product formula which starts at $n=1$.\n2.  **Product identity:** The core of the solution is the factorization of $1-x^k/n^k$ and its relation to a product of Gamma functions. This relies on the cancellation of regularization factors in the Weierstrass product representation of Gamma.\n3.  **Algebra with roots of unity:** Correct application of the factorization formula $a^k-b^k = \\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} (a - \\omega^j b)$ is crucial for simplification.\n4.  **Gamma function recurrence:** The identity $\\Gamma(x+1) = x\\Gamma(x)$ is applied twice to absorb the polynomial factors into the Gamma functions, leading to a compact final answer."
