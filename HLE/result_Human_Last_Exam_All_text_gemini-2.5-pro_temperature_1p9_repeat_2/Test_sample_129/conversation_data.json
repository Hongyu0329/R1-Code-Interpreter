    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by using dynamic programming. Let's define `T(n)` and `F(n)` as the number of true and false boolean expressions of length `n`, respectively. We want to find `T(5)`.\n\n**Step 1: Base Case (Length 1)**\n- True expressions: `T` (1 expression)\n- False expressions: `F` (1 expression)\n- So, `T(1) = 1`, `F(1) = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Expressions of Length 2**\nAn expression of length 2 must be of the form `!A`, where `A` is an expression of length 1.\n- To get a true expression, `A` must be false. `!F`.\n  `T(2) = F(1) = 1`.\n- To get a false expression, `A` must be true. `!T`.\n  `F(2) = T(1) = 1`.\n\n**Step 3: Expressions of Length 3**\nExpressions of length 3 can be formed in three ways:\n1.  **`!A`**, where `A` has length 2.\n    - True: `!A` is true if `A` is false. So, `F(2) = 1` expression (`!!T`).\n    - False: `!A` is false if `A` is true. So, `T(2) = 1` expression (`!!F`).\n2.  **`(A)`**, where `A` has length 1.\n    - True: `(A)` is true if `A` is true. So, `T(1) = 1` expression (`(T)`).\n    - False: `(A)` is false if `A` is false. So, `F(1) = 1` expression (`(F)`).\n3.  **`A op B`**, where `A` and `B` both have length 1 (`op` is `&` or `|`).\n    - Let's analyze `A & B`. Total combinations `T(1)+F(1)` for A and B gives `2*2=4`.\n      - True: Only `T & T` is true. `T(1) * T(1) = 1 * 1 = 1` expression.\n      - False: The other `4 - 1 = 3` expressions are false.\n    - Let's analyze `A | B`. Total combinations `2*2=4`.\n      - False: Only `F | F` is false. `F(1) * F(1) = 1 * 1 = 1` expression.\n      - True: The other `4 - 1 = 3` expressions are true.\nSumming up all contributions for length 3:\n- `T(3) = 1 (from !A) + 1 (from (A)) + 1 (from &) + 3 (from |) = 6`.\n- `F(3) = 1 (from !A) + 1 (from (A)) + 3 (from &) + 1 (from |) = 6`.\n\n**Step 4: Expressions of Length 4**\nExpressions of length 4 can be formed by:\n1.  **`!A`**, where `A` has length 3: `T` requires `A` to be false (`F(3)=6`), `F` requires `A` to be true (`T(3)=6`).\n2.  **`(A)`**, where `A` has length 2: `T` requires `A` true (`T(2)=1`), `F` requires `A` false (`F(2)=1`).\n3.  **`A op B`**, where lengths are (1,2) or (2,1). Let's take (1,2).\n    - Total expressions for `(A,B)` pair: `(T(1)+F(1)) * (T(2)+F(2)) = 2 * 2 = 4`.\n    - `A & B`: True needs `A=T, B=T`. `T(1)*T(2) = 1*1=1`. False are the rest `4-1=3`.\n    - `A | B`: False needs `A=F, B=F`. `F(1)*F(2) = 1*1=1`. True are the rest `4-1=3`.\n    - For (1,2): `1+3=4` True, `3+1=4` False expressions.\n    - For (2,1): Symmetrical, so `4` True, `4` False expressions.\nSumming up all contributions for length 4:\n- `T(4) = 6 (from !A) + 1 (from (A)) + 4 (from op 1,2) + 4 (from op 2,1) = 15`.\n- `F(4) = 6 (from !A) + 1 (from (A)) + 4 (from op 1,2) + 4 (from op 2,1) = 15`.\n\n**Step 5: Expressions of Length 5 (Final Calculation)**\nWe need to find `T(5)`.\nExpressions of length 5 can be formed by:\n1.  **`!A`**, where `A` has length 4. We need `A` to be false.\n    - Contribution: `F(4) = 15`.\n2.  **`(A)`**, where `A` has length 3. We need `A` to be true.\n    - Contribution: `T(3) = 6`.\n3.  **`A op B`**, where length partitions for (A,B) are (1,3), (3,1), and (2,2).\n    - **Partition (1,3):**\n      - Total expression pairs: `(T(1)+F(1)) * (T(3)+F(3)) = 2 * 12 = 24`.\n      - `A & B` true: `T(1) * T(3) = 1 * 6 = 6`.\n      - `A | B` true: Total pairs - (`A|B` is false pairs) = `24 - (F(1) * F(3)) = 24 - (1 * 6) = 18`.\n      - Contribution from (1,3): `6 + 18 = 24`.\n    - **Partition (3,1):** Symmetrical to (1,3).\n      - Contribution from (3,1): `24`.\n    - **Partition (2,2):**\n      - Total expression pairs: `(T(2)+F(2)) * (T(2)+F(2)) = 2 * 2 = 4`.\n      - `A & B` true: `T(2) * T(2) = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n      - `A | B` true: Total pairs - (`A|B` is false pairs) = `4 - (F(2) * F(2)) = 4 - (1 * 1) = 3`.\n      - Contribution from (2,2): `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\nSumming up all contributions for `T(5)`:\n`T(5) = 15 (from !A) + 6 (from (A)) + 24 (from op 1,3) + 24 (from op 3,1) + 4 (from op 2,2)`\n`T(5) = 15 + 6 + 48 + 4`\n`T(5) = 21 + 52`\n`T(5) = 73`\n\n<<<73>>>"
