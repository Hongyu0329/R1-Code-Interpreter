    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the given functions refers to a point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` that simultaneously satisfies the three equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe conditions for the existence (and uniqueness) of such a point are derived from the **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem** (also known as the Contraction Mapping Principle) applied to the product space `X × Y × Z`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Mathematical Space and Operator**\n\nFirst, we must work within a space where the concept of \"distance\" and \"convergence\" is well-defined.\n*   We treat `X`, `Y`, and `Z` as metric spaces, denoted `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)`.\n*   We combine these into a single product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n*   We define a metric `d_W` on this space. A common and useful choice is the sum metric:\n    `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   The system of three equations can be rewritten as a single fixed-point equation `T(p) = p` for a point `p = (x, y, z) ∈ W`. We define the operator `T: W → W` as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n\nA fixed point of this operator `T` is precisely an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** For the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to apply, the underlying metric space must be **complete**. If `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces, then the product space `(W, d_W)` is also complete. This is the first fundamental condition.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Contraction Mapping Principle**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that a contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point. So, the core condition is that our operator `T` must be a **contraction mapping**.\n\nA mapping `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` (the contraction constant) such that for any two points `p₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`:\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d_W(p₁, p₂)`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The contraction constant `k` must be *strictly* less than 1. If `k=1`, the mapping is non-expansive, and the existence of a fixed point is not guaranteed.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the Contraction Condition onto F, G, and H**\n\nWe now expand the contraction inequality for `T` and see what conditions this imposes on the individual functions F, G, and H.\n\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂))`\n`= d_W( (F(x₁,y₁,z₁), G(y₁,x₁,y₁), H(z₁,y₁,x₁)), (F(x₂,y₂,z₂), G(y₂,x₂,y₂), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) )`\n`= d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n\nSo, we need:\n`d_X(...) + d_Y(...) + d_Z(...) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\nThis global condition is typically satisfied if F, G, and H each satisfy a mixed Lipschitz-type condition. We assume there exist non-negative constants such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n\n1.  **For F:** `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α*d_X(x₁, x₂) + β*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  **For G:** `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ δ*d_X(x₁, x₂) + ε*d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n3.  **For H:** `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ ζ*d_Z(z₁, z₂) + η*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + θ*d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Note the arguments in the functions. For `G`, the input variables are from `Y` and `X`. For `H`, they are from `Z`, `Y`, and `X`. The constants correspond to how much the function's output changes with respect to changes in each of its inputs.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Final Condition**\n\nNow, we sum the inequalities from Step 3:\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α*d_X + β*d_Y + γ*d_Z) + (δ*d_X + ε*d_Y) + (ζ*d_Z + η*d_Y + θ*d_X)`\n\nCollecting terms by metric:\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α + δ + θ)d_X(x₁, x₂) + (β + ε + η)d_Y(y₁, y₂) + (γ + ζ)d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\nFor this to be a contraction, we must be able to bound this sum by `k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)`.\nLet `k_x = α + δ + θ`, `k_y = β + ε + η`, and `k_z = γ + ζ`.\nLet `k = max(k_x, k_y, k_z)`.\n\nThen the sum is bounded by:\n`≤ k*d_X(x₁, x₂) + k*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + k*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n`≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)) = k * d_W(p₁, p₂)`\n\nThe overall condition for `T` to be a contraction is `k < 1`.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\nFor the functions F, G, and H to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1.  **(Complete Metric Spaces):** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be non-empty, complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **(Mixed Lipschitz Conditions):** There must exist nine non-negative constants (`α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ`) such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in the product space, the following inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α*d_X(x₁, x₂) + β*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ δ*d_X(x₁, x₂) + ε*d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ ζ*d_Z(z₁, z₂) + η*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + θ*d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n3.  **(Overall Contraction Condition):** The sum of the coefficients corresponding to each component space's metric must be less than 1. That is, if we define:\n    *   `k_x = α + δ + θ`\n    *   `k_y = β + ε + η`\n    *   `k_z = γ + ζ`\n    Then the condition is that `max(k_x, k_y, k_z) < 1`.\n\nIf these three sets of conditions are satisfied, the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.\n\n<<<Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. The functions F, G, and H have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point if there exist non-negative constants `α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following two conditions are met:\n1. The functions satisfy the mixed Lipschitz conditions:\n   *  `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α*d_X(x₁, x₂) + β*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n   *  `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ δ*d_X(x₁, x₂) + ε*d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n   *  `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ ζ*d_Z(z₁, z₂) + η*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + θ*d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n2. The constants satisfy the aggregate contraction condition:\n   `max(α + δ + θ, β + ε + η, γ + ζ) < 1`>>>"
