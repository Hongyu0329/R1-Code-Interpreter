    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Space**\nThe space of $k$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. In this question, we are dealing with $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\nThere is a diffeomorphism $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cong G_{n-k}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. Thus, the space of $3$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is diffeomorphic to the space of $2$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, i.e., $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5) \\cong G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. We will analyze $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\nThe dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Structure of the Cohomology Groups**\nThe integral cohomology groups of a real Grassmannian, $H^i(G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n); \\mathbb{Z})$, are known to be direct sums of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The torsion part consists entirely of 2-torsion.\nThe Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology connects the integral cohomology $H^i$ to the integral homology $H_i$ and $H_{i-1}$. Let $H_i(M;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus T_i$, where $b_i$ is the $i$-th Betti number and $T_i$ is the torsion subgroup. As all torsion is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, we can write $T_i = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_i}$. The theorem gives:\n$H^i(M;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus T_{i-1} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{i-1}}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Homology Groups**\nTo find the integral cohomology, we first determine the integral homology groups by finding the values of $b_i$ and $t_i$. This can be done by relating them to the dimensions of the homology groups with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, denoted $d_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H_i(M;\\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\nThe Universal Coefficient Theorem for homology gives the relation: $d_i = b_i + t_i + t_{i-1}$.\n\nThe values of $d_i$ for $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ are given by the number of Schubert cells of dimension $i$. For $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the cells are indexed by partitions $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ such that $3 \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge 0$. The dimension of a cell is $|\\lambda|=\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2$.\n- dim 0: (0,0) -> $d_0=1$\n- dim 1: (1,0) -> $d_1=1$\n- dim 2: (2,0), (1,1) -> $d_2=2$\n- dim 3: (3,0), (2,1) -> $d_3=2$\n- dim 4: (3,1), (2,2) -> $d_4=2$\n- dim 5: (3,2) -> $d_5=1$\n- dim 6: (3,3) -> $d_6=1$\nSo we have the sequence $(d_0, d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6) = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Use Known Properties to Constrain Homology Groups**\nWe need more information to solve for all $b_i$ and $t_i$.\n1.  For any connected space, $H_0(M;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus $b_0=1$ and $t_0=0$.\n2.  The fundamental group of $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is $\\pi_1(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. By Hurewicz theorem, $H_1(M;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1/[\\pi_1,\\pi_1] = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus $b_1=0$ and $t_1=1$.\n3.  $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is a compact non-orientable manifold of dimension 6 (it's non-orientable because $n-2k = 5-4=1$ is odd and $w_1(\\gamma) \\neq 0$). This implies $H_6(M;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. So $b_6=0$ and $t_6=0$.\n4. A result from A. Borel states that $H_3(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5);\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $b_3=1$ and $t_3=0$.\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Remaining Unknowns**\nWe now use the equations $d_i = b_i+t_i+t_{i-1}$ along with the known values to find the remaining coefficients.\n- $d_6 = b_6+t_6+t_5 \\implies 1 = 0+0+t_5 \\implies t_5=1$.\n- $d_5 = b_5+t_5+t_4 \\implies 1 = b_5+1+t_4 \\implies b_5+t_4=0$. Since $b_5, t_4 \\ge 0$, we have $b_5=0, t_4=0$.\n- We know $b_3=1, t_3=0$.\n- $d_2 = b_2+t_2+t_1 \\implies 2 = b_2+t_2+1 \\implies b_2+t_2=1$.\n- $d_3 = b_3+t_3+t_2 \\implies 2 = 1+0+t_2 \\implies t_2=1$.\n- Substituting $t_2=1$ into $b_2+t_2=1$, we get $b_2+1=1 \\implies b_2=0$.\n- $d_4 = b_4+t_4+t_3 \\implies 2 = b_4+0+0 \\implies b_4=2$.\n\nThis completes the determination of all coefficients for the integral homology:\n- $b=(1,0,0,1,2,0,0)$\n- $t=(0,1,1,0,0,1,0)$\n\n**Step 6: Compute the Integral Cohomology Groups**\nUsing the formula $H^i(M;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{i-1}}$:\n- $H^0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{1} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{-1}} = \\mathbb{Z}$\n- $H^1 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{0} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{0}} = 0$\n- $H^2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{0} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{1}} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n- $H^3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{1} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{2}} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n- $H^4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{2} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{3}} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$\n- $H^5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{0} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{4}} = 0$\n- $H^6 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{0} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_{5}} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\n**Step 7: Analyze the Torsion Subgroup**\nThe integral cohomology ring is the direct sum $H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe torsion subgroup of this ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group:\n$T = \\text{Tors}(H^*) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 \\text{Tors}(H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\nFrom our calculation:\n- $\\text{Tors}(H^0)=0$\n- $\\text{Tors}(H^1)=0$\n- $\\text{Tors}(H^2)=\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n- $\\text{Tors}(H^3)=\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n- $\\text{Tors}(H^4)=0$\n- $\\text{Tors}(H^5)=0$\n- $\\text{Tors}(H^6)=\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nSo, the torsion subgroup is $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$.\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the \"rank\" of this torsion subgroup.\n- In the technical sense of the rank of a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module (an abelian group), the rank of any torsion group is 0.\n- However, in this context, \"rank\" often refers to the minimal number of generators for the group, or its dimension as a vector space over the relevant prime field.\nFor the group $T \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$, the minimal number of generators is 3. This is also its dimension as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This is the most likely intended meaning of the question.\n\nThe number of generators for the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is 3."
