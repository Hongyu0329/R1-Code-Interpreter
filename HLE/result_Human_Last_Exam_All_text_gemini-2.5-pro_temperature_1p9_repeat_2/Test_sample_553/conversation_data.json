    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terms\n\nFirst, we need to understand the music theory concepts mentioned in the question.\n*   **The Beatles:** The artist in question. We only need to consider their catalog of songs.\n*   **Starts with:** The chord progression must occur at the very beginning of the song, likely as the introduction.\n*   **Tonic:** This is the \"home\" chord of the key the song is in. It's the first chord in the scale, denoted by the Roman numeral I (in a major key) or i (in a minor key). For example, in the key of G major, the tonic is G major.\n*   **Minor fifth chord:** This is the crucial part. The \"fifth\" refers to the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n    *   In a major key, the fifth chord (also called the dominant) is naturally a **major** chord (V). For example, in G major, the fifth chord is D major. A \"minor fifth chord\" in this context would be D minor (v), which is a non-diatonic chord borrowed from the parallel minor key.\n    *   In a natural minor key, the fifth chord is naturally a **minor** chord (v). For example, in A minor, the fifth chord is E minor.\n*   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct and prominent change from the first chord to the second.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that starts with either a **I -> v** progression in a major key (e.g., A major to E minor) or a **i -> v** progression in a minor key (e.g., A minor to E minor). The first case (I -> v) is a more distinct and noteworthy harmonic choice.\n\n### Step 2: Search for the Progression in The Beatles' Songs\n\nNow, we will mentally scan the openings of Beatles songs to find this specific progression.\n\n*   Many famous intros like \"A Hard Day's Night,\" \"Help!,\" \"Ticket to Ride,\" or \"Yesterday\" do not use this I -> v progression at the start.\n*   Let's consider the song **\"I'll Be Back\"** from the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n    *   The song is in the key of **A major**. Therefore, the tonic chord (I) is **A major**.\n    *   The song opens with an acoustic guitar playing a distinct two-chord pattern before any vocals begin.\n    *   The first chord is **A major**.\n    *   The second chord is **E minor**.\n    *   In the key of A major, the fifth note of the scale is E. The standard fifth chord (V) would be E major. By playing **E minor**, they are playing the **minor fifth chord (v)**.\n    *   This opening progression of **A major -> E minor** is a perfect example of a jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth chord (v) in a major key.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Other Possibilities and Final Conclusion\n\nLet's briefly consider another song, **\"Things We Said Today,\"** also from *A Hard Day's Night*.\n*   The verse of this song starts in the key of **A minor**.\n*   The first chord, sung with the lyric \"You say...\", is **A minor (i)**, the tonic.\n*   The second chord, on \"...will love me\", is **E minor (v)**, the minor fifth.\n*   This also fits the description. However, the I -> v progression in a major key found in \"I'll Be Back\" is a more distinctive harmonic device (called modal interchange). Furthermore, the progression in \"I'll Be Back\" serves as the song's instrumental introduction, making it a very clear and prominent \"start.\"\n\nGiven these points, \"I'll Be Back\" is the most precise and definitive answer to the question. Its famous opening is built entirely around this specific chord change.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Key Recognition:** Correctly identifying the song's key is essential to determine the tonic chord.\n2.  **Diatonic vs. Non-Diatonic:** Understanding that the minor fifth (v) is a standard chord in a minor key but a \"borrowed\" chord in a major key helps identify why the progression in \"I'll Be Back\" is particularly notable.\n3.  **Intro vs. Verse:** The question specifies the song \"starts with\" this progression. \"I'll Be Back\" uses it as a purely instrumental intro, which is a very strong form of \"starting.\"\n4.  **Typos:** The question contains a typo (\"fitfh\"), which should be correctly interpreted as \"fifth.\"\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition:\nThe analysis confirms that \"I'll Be Back\" begins in the key of A major (tonic = A major) and immediately jumps to an E minor chord (the minor fifth chord). This matches the question's criteria perfectly.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
