    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key figure and context:** The question is about a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault during World War II in the United Kingdom.\n2.  **Identify the core conflict:** UK counterintelligence (specifically MI5) suspected him of being a German spy.\n3.  **Identify the reason for suspicion:** The primary reason stated is that he concealed his \"true profession\" from his interrogators.\n4.  **Identify the false information given:** Upon his arrival and during interrogation at Camp 020 (Latchmere House), Vernault claimed he was an electrician.\n5.  **Identify why the false profession was doubted:** Interrogators found his story unconvincing. One common reason cited in historical accounts is that his hands were not calloused or rough like those of a manual laborer. This discrepancy made them believe \"electrician\" was a cover story, a common tactic for trained spies.\n6.  **Determine the concealed truth:** Historical records and accounts of MI5 operations reveal that Andre Vernault was not an electrician. His actual, hidden profession was that he was a Roman Catholic priest.\n7.  **Understand the motive for concealment:** Vernault feared that revealing he was a priest would be met with anti-Catholic prejudice in what was then a predominantly Protestant Britain. He may also have wanted to protect his religious order or thought a simple, secular profession would cause fewer complications as a refugee.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the agency:** The agency involved was the British Security Service, commonly known as MI5.\n*   **The nature of the suspicion:** It was a false belief. Vernault was not actually a spy.\n*   **The location of interrogation:** These interrogations often took place at specialized centers like Latchmere House (Camp 020), which was designed to \"break\" suspected enemy agents.\n*   **The logic of the interrogators:** Lying about a fundamental aspect of one's identity like a profession is a classic indicator of espionage training. Their suspicion, while incorrect in this case, was based on established counterintelligence principles.\n*   **Motive for the lie:** The reason for Vernault's lie was not espionage, but personal fear of religious prejudice and a desire for a simpler identity as a refugee.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the correct answer regarding Andre Vernault's true profession.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nHis true profession was a Roman Catholic priest.\n\n<<<Roman Catholic priest>>>"
