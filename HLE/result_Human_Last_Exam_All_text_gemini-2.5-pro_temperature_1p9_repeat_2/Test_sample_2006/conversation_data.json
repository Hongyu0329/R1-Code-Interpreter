    "This is a multi-layered riddle that requires breaking down a haiku and its title.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Title as the Question:** The title of the haiku is \"The Bays\". The prompt states that the title is a question. Phonetically, \"The Bays\" sounds like \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\". The answer will be a list of words that start with the letter 'B', which are hidden as clues within the haiku.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Line:** \"An August tempest\". This line sets a scene of great conflict or turmoil. It serves as a metaphor for World War II, during which a crucial codebreaking operation took place. This operation was centered at a specific location, our first \"B\": **Bletchley** Park.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Line:** \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\". This is a direct numerical clue.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" calculates to 2 x 15 = 30.\n    *   The number 30 is associated with something that brought \"winds of change,\" a phrase implying a pivotal, transformative event.\n    *   At Bletchley Park, the codebreaking efforts were dramatically accelerated by electro-mechanical machines. By a certain point in the war, there were about thirty of these machines in operation. This gives us our second \"B\": the **Bombe** machine, designed by Alan Turing and his colleagues. These machines were instrumental in changing the course of the war.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Third Line:** \"A divine one yields\". This line can be interpreted in a few ways that point to the final \"B\".\n    *   It can refer to a single, singular Bombe machine (a \"divine\" invention) which \"yields\" a decrypted message.\n    *   It also connects back to the \"winds of change\" from the previous line. A strong wind or tempest is composed of moving air. A lighter, gentler form of wind is a **breeze**. The \"divine one\" could be a simple solution (a \"breeze\") emerging from a complex problem (the \"tempest\"). This provides the third \"B\".\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Order the Answer:** The three \"B's\" we have uncovered are Bletchley, Bombe, and Breeze. The prompt asks for the answer to be in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   **Bletchley**\n    *   **Bombe**\n    *   **Breeze**\n\n    When placed in alphabetical order, the sequence is Bletchley, Bombe, Breeze.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting together the pieces from the analysis: The question is \"What are the B's?\", and the clues in the haiku point to Bletchley, Bombe, and Breeze. Listed in alphabetical order, this is the final answer.\n\n<<<Bletchley, Bombe, Breeze>>>"
