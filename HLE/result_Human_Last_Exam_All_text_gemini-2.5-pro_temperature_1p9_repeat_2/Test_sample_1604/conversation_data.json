    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the historically latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe core task is to identify all the battles painted by the artist Elizabeth Southerden Thompson, Lady Butler, and then determine which of these battles occurred most recently in history. This means we must focus on the **date of the battle**, not the date the painting was created.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Major Paintings by Lady Butler and the Battles They Depict**\nWe need to compile a list of Lady Butler's famous military paintings and the historical events they portray.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the **Battle of Quatre Bras**, which occurred on June 16, 1815, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo**, which took place on June 18, 1815.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted 1879): Shows Dr. William Brydon arriving at Jalalabad as the lone European survivor of the **1842 retreat from Kabul** during the First Anglo-Afghan War. The event took place in January 1842.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts a roll call of the Grenadier Guards after the **Battle of Inkerman** during the Crimean War. The battle was on November 5, 1854.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Shows the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the **Battle of Balaclava**, also during the Crimean War, on October 25, 1854.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Portrays the **Battle of Rorke's Drift** during the Anglo-Zulu War, which occurred on January 22–23, 1879.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882): Depicts an incident during the **Battle of Laing's Nek** in the First Boer War, which was fought on January 28, 1881.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted 1885): This painting depicts the arrival of the Desert Column's Camel Corps at the wells of Gubat after the **Battle of Abu Klea** during the Nile Expedition (to relieve Khartoum). The battle was on January 17, 1885.\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted in the 1920s): Depicts a specific event from the First World War, the **Great Retreat from Mons**. This campaign took place from August 23 to September 5, 1914.\n\n### **Step 3: List the Battles in Chronological Order**\nNow we arrange the events by their historical date to find the latest one.\n\n1.  **Battle of Quatre Bras:** June 16, 1815\n2.  **Battle of Waterloo:** June 18, 1815\n3.  **Retreat from Kabul:** January 1842\n4.  **Battle of Balaclava:** October 25, 1854\n5.  **Battle of Inkerman:** November 5, 1854\n6.  **Battle of Rorke's Drift:** January 22–23, 1879\n7.  **Battle of Laing's Nek:** January 28, 1881\n8.  **Battle of Abu Klea:** January 17, 1885\n9.  **Retreat from Mons (WWI):** August-September 1914\n\n### **Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\nBy comparing the dates, it is clear that the **Retreat from Mons**, which occurred in **1914** at the beginning of the First World War, is the latest historical event on this list. While many of Lady Butler's most famous paintings depict 19th-century conflicts, she lived until 1933 and also painted scenes from World War I.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe latest battle historically depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Retreat from Mons.\n\n<<<The Retreat from Mons"
