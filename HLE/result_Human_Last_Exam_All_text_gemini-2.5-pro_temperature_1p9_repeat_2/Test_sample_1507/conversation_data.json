    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object in question - the Great Icosahedron.**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra (also known as star polyhedra). It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Because its faces intersect, it is not a convex shape.\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"outer-hull\".**\nThe term \"outer-hull\" or \"convex hull\" of a geometric object refers to the smallest convex shape that completely contains the object. For a polyhedron, the convex hull can be found by \"shrink-wrapping\" its vertices. The vertices of the great icosahedron all lie on its convex hull.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the shape of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.**\nThe great icosahedron has 12 vertices. These 12 vertices are arranged with the same symmetry and occupy the exact same positions as the 12 vertices of a regular icosahedron (one of the five Platonic solids). Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the triangulation of the outer-hull.**\nThe question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed for \"triangulating the outer-hull\".\n*   The outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n*   The surface of a regular icosahedron is already composed entirely of triangular faces.\n*   A triangulation of a surface means covering it with triangles. Since the faces of the icosahedron are already triangles, the simplest and minimal triangulation is the set of its own faces. No further subdivision is necessary.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of triangles.**\nWe need to find the number of faces on a regular icosahedron. By definition, a regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles.\n\n**Step 6: Interpret \"the number of visible triangles from the outside\".**\nThis phrase is an alternative way of asking for the number of faces of the convex hull. When viewing a non-convex object from the outside, what you see is the surface of its convex hull. Since the convex hull is a regular icosahedron, the \"visible triangles\" are the 20 triangular faces of this icosahedron.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth parts of the question point to the same answer: the number of faces of the regular icosahedron, which is the convex hull of the great icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 faces.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
