    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot, $3_1$. Let $\\tau_5(K)$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which is a knotted 2-sphere in $S^4$. Let $X$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ over $\\tau_5(K)$. We want to find the minimal number of generators of $\\pi_1(X)$, denoted $d(\\pi_1(X))$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the fundamental group of the knot complement, $G_K$.**\nThe trefoil knot $K=3_1$ is the $(2,3)$-torus knot. Its knot group, $G_K = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$, has a standard presentation:\n$G_K = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental group of the complement of the twist-spun knot.**\nLet $\\Pi_n(K) = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_n(K))$ be the fundamental group of the complement of the $n$-twist-spun knot. According to a result by Yajima, this group is an HNN extension of the knot group $G_K$:\n$\\Pi_n(K) = \\langle G_K, t \\mid \\forall g \\in G_K, t g t^{-1} = \\phi_n(g) \\rangle$,\nwhere $\\phi_n$ is the automorphism of $G_K$ given by conjugation by the $n$-th power of a meridian, $\\phi_n(g) = \\mu^{-n} g \\mu^n$.\n\nFor the trefoil group $G_K = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$, we can choose a meridian $\\mu=a$. The element $z=a^2=b^3$ is central in $G_K$.\nFor $n=5$, the automorphism is $\\phi_5(g) = a^{-5} g a^5$. We can simplify this using the central element:\n$\\phi_5(g) = a^{-1} a^{-4} g a^4 a = a^{-1} (a^2)^{-2} g (a^2)^2 a = a^{-1} z^{-2} g z^2 a = a^{-1} g a$.\nSo the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil is:\n$\\Pi_5(3_1) = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=b^3, t g t^{-1} = a^{-1} g a \\text{ for } g \\in \\{a,b\\} \\rangle$.\nLet's check the relations for the generators $a$ and $b$:\n$tat^{-1} = a^{-1}aa = a$. This means $t$ commutes with $a$.\n$tbt^{-1} = a^{-1}ba$.\nSo, $\\Pi_5(3_1) = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=b^3, [t,a]=1, tbt^{-1}=a^{-1}ba \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the fundamental group of the double branched cover.**\nThe fundamental group of the 2-fold branched cover of $S^4$ over a locally flat surface $F$ is given by the quotient of the group of the complement of $F$ by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian element.\n$\\pi_1(X) = \\Pi_5(3_1) / \\langle\\langle m^2 \\rangle\\rangle$, where $m$ is a meridian of $\\tau_5(K)$. Such a meridian corresponds to a meridian of the original knot $K$. We can choose $m=a$.\nLet $H = \\pi_1(X)$. We take the presentation for $\\Pi_5(3_1)$ and add the relation $a^2=1$.\n$H = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=b^3, [t,a]=1, tbt^{-1}=a^{-1}ba, a^2=1 \\rangle$.\nThe relations can be simplified:\n1.  From $a^2=1$ and $a^2=b^3$, we get $b^3=1$.\n2.  The relation $[t,a]=1$ remains.\n3.  Since $a^2=1$, we have $a=a^{-1}$. The relation $tbt^{-1}=a^{-1}ba$ becomes $tbt^{-1}=aba$.\nSo the fundamental group of the branched cover is:\n$H = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=1, b^3=1, [a,t]=1, tbt^{-1}=aba \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the minimal number of generators for $H$.**\nThe minimal number of generators of a group $G$, $d(G)$, is bounded below by the minimal number of generators of its abelianization, $d(G_{ab})$.\nThe abelianization $H_{ab}$ is obtained by adding relations that make all generators commute. The relation $tbt^{-1}=aba$ becomes $b = aba$. With commutation, this is $b=a^2b$, which simplifies to $b=b$ (since $a^2=1$). Thus, this relation becomes trivial in the abelianization.\n$H_{ab} = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=1, b^3=1, [a,b]=1, [a,t]=1, [b,t]=1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_6 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ is 2. So $d(H) \\ge 2$.\n\nHowever, a stronger lower bound can be found. An important property of $H$ is that the element $t^3$ is central. Let's prove this:\n$t$ commutes with $a$, so $t^3$ commutes with $a$.\nLet's check commutation with $b$:\n$tbt^{-1} = aba$\n$t^2bt^{-2} = t(aba)t^{-1} = (tat^{-1})(tbt^{-1})(tat^{-1}) = a(aba)a = a^2ba^2 = 1 \\cdot b \\cdot 1 = b$. No, $a^2=1$, so $a^2ba^2 = ba$. Recomputing:\n$t^2 b t^{-2} = a (aba) a = a^2 b a^2 = ba$.\n$t^3 b t^{-3} = t(ba)t^{-1} = (tbt^{-1})(tat^{-1}) = (aba)a = aba^2=b$.\nSo $t^3b = bt^3$.\nSince $t^3$ commutes with the generators $a, b, t$, it is central in $H$.\n\nNow consider the quotient group $Q = H/\\langle t^3 \\rangle$, where we quotient by the central subgroup generated by $t^3$. The number of generators for $Q$ provides a lower bound for $d(H)$, i.e., $d(H) \\ge d(Q)$.\n$Q = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=1, b^3=1, t^3=1, [a,t]=1, tbt^{-1}=aba \\rangle$.\nLet's compute the abelianization of $Q$:\n$Q_{ab} = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2, b^3, t^3, \\text{all commute} \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nThe minimal number of generators of a finite abelian group $\\mathbb{Z}_{n_1} \\times \\dots \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{n_k}$ is the number of primary cyclic factors in its decomposition.\nFor $Q_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$, the prime-power factors are $2^1, 3^1, 3^1$. There are 3 factors. So, $d(Q_{ab})=3$.\nSince $d(Q) \\ge d(Q_{ab})$, we have $d(Q) \\ge 3$.\nAs $d(H) \\ge d(Q)$, we must have $d(H) \\ge 3$.\nOn the other hand, the group $H$ can be generated by the set $\\{a, b, t\\}$, which has 3 elements. Therefore, $d(H) \\le 3$.\nCombining the inequalities, we have $3 \\le d(H) \\le 3$.\n\nThus, the minimal number of generators for $H = \\pi_1(X)$ is 3."
