    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe query asks to identify a specific novel based on two key pieces of information attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n*   **A quote about the novel:** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **A description of the author:** He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**2. List of Careful Points:**\n*   **The Source:** The opinion comes from Jorge Luis Borges, a writer known for his appreciation of intellectual complexity, labyrinthine plots, and precise language. His use of the \"chess duel\" metaphor is therefore very significant, pointing to a highly structured and strategic narrative.\n*   **The Author Description:** The phrase \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a crucial filter. Many Latin American \"Boom\" writers were influenced by William Faulkner's techniques (e.g., non-linear timelines, stream of consciousness, multiple perspectives). The key is the \"simplifier\" part, which suggests the author adapted these complex techniques into a more organized or systematic framework, rather than simply mimicking Faulkner's dense prose.\n*   **The Novel's Description:** The quote is a paradox. \"Intensity of a tiger\" suggests raw, violent, passionate, and perhaps primal subject matter. \"Variety that a chess duel can achieve\" suggests a formal, intellectual, and intricate structure where every element is part of a larger, calculated game. The correct novel must embody both these qualities.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Identify Potential Authors**\nBased on the description \"continuator of Faulkner\" within the context of Latin American literature, the primary candidates are:\n*   Gabriel García Márquez\n*   Mario Vargas Llosa\n*   Juan Carlos Onetti\n*   Juan Rulfo\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates Against the Clues**\n*   **Gabriel García Márquez:** He famously called Faulkner his master. *One Hundred Years of Solitude* has a sprawling, mythic quality. However, while intricate, its structure is often described as cyclical or biblical, not necessarily as a \"chess duel.\"\n*   **Mario Vargas Llosa:** He is renowned for his structurally complex novels, explicitly using Faulknerian techniques like fragmented timelines and shifting perspectives in a highly systematic way that he called *vasos comunicantes* (communicating vessels). This methodical application of complex techniques fits the \"continuator (and simplifier)\" description perfectly. His early novels are also filled with violence, political strife, and raw human drama, matching the \"intensity of a tiger.\"\n*   **Juan Rulfo:** His work, particularly *Pedro Páramo*, is Faulknerian in its fragmented, ghost-like narrative. However, it is known for its spare, minimalist style, which does not quite fit the \"variety of a chess duel.\"\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Quote to the Most Likely Candidate**\nThe description of a \"chess duel\" points strongly toward Mario Vargas Llosa. His novels are often compared to intricate puzzles or architectural constructions that the reader must piece together. The quote specifically refers to his second novel, **La casa verde (The Green House)**, published in 1966.\n\n*   **\"Intensity of a tiger\":** The novel is set in two brutal environments: the Peruvian Amazon jungle and the harsh desert city of Piura. It deals with themes of exploitation, prostitution, violence, and the collision of \"civilization\" and the \"savage\" world.\n*   **\"Variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** The novel is famous for its complex structure, weaving together five separate plotlines over a 40-year period. These narratives jump between time and location without warning, and their connections only become clear as the novel progresses, forcing the reader to engage intellectually, much like analyzing a chess game.\n\nBorges's praise was directed at this masterpiece of structural engineering and raw narrative power. He saw in Vargas Llosa an heir to Faulkner who had disciplined the chaos into a brilliant, strategic game.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges was referring to is **La casa verde (The Green House)** by **Mario Vargas Llosa**.\n\n<<<La casa verde (The Green House)>>>"
