    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant knots and surgeries\n\nThe homology cobordism group $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ consists of integral homology 3-spheres modulo the equivalence of homology cobordism.\nAn integral surgery on a knot $K$ results in a homology sphere if and only if the surgery coefficient is $\\pm 1$. The resulting manifolds are denoted $S^3_{+1}(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$.\n\nWe need to consider all knots with crossing number $c(K) \\leq 4$. The standard knot table lists knots up to mirror images. As mirror images can lead to different homology spheres, we must consider chiral knots and their mirrors separately.\n\nThe list of knots with $c(K) \\leq 4$ is:\n1.  **Unknot ($0_1$)**: This knot is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n2.  **Trefoil knot ($3_1$)**: This knot is chiral. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil (let's denote it $3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (its mirror image, $m(3_1)$).\n3.  **Figure-eight knot ($4_1$)**: This knot is amphichiral.\n\nSo, we need to analyze the homology spheres obtained from $\\pm 1$ surgery on the knots $\\{0_1, 3_1, m(3_1), 4_1\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the surgery on each knot and identify the resulting group elements\n\nWe analyze the elements $[S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)]$ in the group $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ for each knot $K$. The identity element is $[S^3]$, and the inverse of an element $[Y]$ is $[-Y]$, where $-Y$ is the manifold $Y$ with reversed orientation.\n\n1.  **Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ are both diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   This gives the identity element $[S^3]$ in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n    *   **Contribution:** 1 element.\n\n2.  **Trefoil knots ($3_1$ and $m(3_1)$)**:\n    *   Let $B = [S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$ and $C = [S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$.\n    *   These are known to be non-trivial elements. For example, their Casson invariants are non-zero. The surgery $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$ gives $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$, the negative of the Poincar√© homology sphere. Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda = -1$. The surgery $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$ gives $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ with $\\lambda=1$. Since their Casson invariants differ, $B \\neq C$.\n    *   A deep result in 3-manifold topology states that $S^3_{+1}(K) \\# S^3_{-1}(K)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3$ for $K=3_1$. This implies $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)] + [S^3_{-1}(3_1)] = [S^3]$, which means $B + C = 0$, or $C = -B$.\n    *   The trefoil knot has Arf invariant 0, which implies that surgeries on it produce elements of infinite order. Thus, $B \\neq -B$.\n    *   So, the right-handed trefoil $3_1$ gives two distinct, non-trivial elements: $B$ and $-B$.\n    *   For the left-handed trefoil $m(3_1)$, we use the relation $S^3_p(m(K)) \\cong -S^3_{-p}(K)$.\n        *   $[S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))] = [-S^3_{-1}(3_1)] = -C = -(-B) = B$.\n        *   $[S^3_{-1}(m(3_1))] = [-S^3_{+1}(3_1)] = -B$.\n    *   These are the same elements obtained from the right-handed trefoil.\n    *   **Contribution:** 2 distinct, non-trivial elements.\n\n3.  **Figure-eight knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   Let $A = [S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$.\n    *   The figure-eight knot has Arf invariant 1. A theorem by C. L. Gordon states that $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot with Arf invariant 1 yields an element of order 2 in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n    *   Therefore, $A$ is an element of order 2, meaning $2A = 0$, or $A = -A$.\n    *   For the other surgery, $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$. Since $4_1$ is amphichiral, $S^3_{-1}(4_1) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(4_1)$.\n    *   Thus, $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)] = [-S^3_{+1}(4_1)] = -A$.\n    *   Since $A$ has order 2, we have $-A=A$. So, both $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries on the figure-eight knot represent the *same* element $A$ in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n    *   Now we must check if $A$ is distinct from the elements found previously.\n        *   $A \\neq [S^3]$ because $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ has a non-zero Casson invariant ($\\lambda=-1$), whereas $\\lambda(S^3)=0$.\n        *   $A \\neq B = [S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$? Both manifolds have Casson invariant $\\lambda=-1$. However, $A$ is of order 2, while $B$ is of infinite order. Different orders imply they are different group elements.\n        *   $A \\neq -B = [S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$? Their Casson invariants differ ($\\lambda(A)=-1$, $\\lambda(-B)=1$), so they are different elements.\n    *   **Contribution:** 1 new element.\n\n### Step 3: Count the total number of distinct elements\n\nSumming up the contributions from each knot type:\n*   From the unknot: 1 element ($[S^3]$).\n*   From the trefoil knots ($3_1$ and $m(3_1)$): 2 elements ($[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$ and its inverse $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$).\n*   From the figure-eight knot: 1 element ($[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$ which is its own inverse).\n\nThe total number of distinct elements is $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\nThese four distinct elements can be represented, for example, by the manifolds:\n1.  $S^3$ (the identity element)\n2.  $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$ (element of infinite order)\n3.  $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$ (the inverse of the previous element)\n4.  $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ (element of order 2)\n\nFinal check of distinctness using Casson invariant ($\\lambda$) and order:\n*   $[S^3]$: $(\\lambda, \\text{order})=(0,1)$\n*   $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$: $(\\lambda, \\text{order})=(-1, \\infty)$\n*   $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$: $(\\lambda, \\text{order})=(1, \\infty)$\n*   $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$: $(\\lambda, \\text{order})=(-1, 2)$\n\nAll four are distinct.\n\n<<<4>>>"
