    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction and Reactants:**\nThe synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct chemical reaction between elemental xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\nXe (g) + 2 F2 (g) → XeF4 (s)\n\n**2. Analyze the Factors Affecting the Reaction:**\nFor a chemical synthesis to be \"efficient,\" two main factors must be optimized:\n*   **Reaction Rate (Kinetics):** The reaction must proceed at a reasonable speed to produce a significant amount of product in a practical timeframe. Chemical reactions generally require an input of energy, called activation energy, to start. Temperature is a key factor; lower temperatures lead to exponentially slower reaction rates.\n*   **Yield and Selectivity (Thermodynamics & Conditions):** The reaction conditions should favor the formation of the desired product (XeF4) over other possible products (like XeF2 or XeF6) or the starting materials. The ratio of reactants, pressure, and temperature all influence which product is dominant.\n\n**3. Examine the Specific Conditions for Xenon Fluorides:**\nThe synthesis of different xenon fluorides is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions:\n*   **XeF2:** Formed by reacting Xe and F2 in a Xe excess, often using UV light or moderate heating.\n*   **XeF4:** Formed by reacting Xe and F2 in a molar ratio of approximately 1:5 (an excess of fluorine compared to the 1:2 stoichiometry). This pushes the reaction past XeF2 but helps prevent the formation of XeF6.\n*   **XeF6:** Formed using a large excess of fluorine (e.g., 1:20 ratio) and higher pressures and temperatures (e.g., 300°C and 60 atm).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Role of Temperature in XeF4 Synthesis:**\n*   **Activation Energy:** The direct reaction between Xe and F2 has a significant activation energy. At room temperature or below, the rate of reaction is practically zero. Therefore, energy must be supplied, usually in the form of heat.\n*   **The \"Sweet Spot\":** The established and most common method for the efficient, high-yield production of XeF4 involves heating the 1:5 mixture of Xe and F2 in a sealed nickel container. The standard temperature for this process is **400 °C**.\n    *   **Why not colder?** At temperatures significantly below 400 °C (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction rate becomes very slow. The synthesis would take an impractically long time to produce a good yield, making it inefficient. At temperatures like 78 °C, 0 °C, or -78 °C, there is insufficient thermal energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, and no significant reaction occurs.\n    *   **Why not hotter?** At temperatures much higher than 400 °C (e.g., 600 °C), the reaction equilibrium can shift. While the reaction might be faster, the formation of the higher fluoride, XeF6, becomes more favorable. Furthermore, the decomposition of XeF4 back into Xe and F2 can also become a competing reaction. Therefore, 600 °C is less efficient for selectively producing XeF4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **\"Efficiently\" is Key:** The question is not \"what is the lowest temperature at which any XeF4 can possibly form?\" but rather \"what is the coldest temperature for *efficient* production?\". This brings kinetics (reaction speed) to the forefront. A reaction that takes weeks to produce a tiny yield is not efficient.\n2.  **Standard Industrial/Lab Method:** The benchmark for an \"efficient\" process is the one commonly used in laboratories and industry, which has been optimized for rate and yield. That method uses heat.\n3.  **Other Synthesis Methods:** While methods like using electrical discharge or ultraviolet (UV) radiation can initiate the reaction at lower ambient temperatures, the thermal method (heating) is the most straightforward, controllable, and common for producing pure XeF4 in good quantities. Even with these other methods, a certain energy input is still required. 400 °C represents the standard thermal condition for efficiency.\n4.  **Evaluating the Choices:** Based on the analysis, 400 °C is the well-documented optimal temperature. Temperatures below this are kinetically too slow for an efficient process. The temperature of 600 °C is too high, leading to reduced selectivity. Therefore, 400 °C represents the coldest temperature among the given options where production is still considered efficient.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe synthesis of XeF4 requires heating to overcome the activation energy. The standard, efficient process occurs at approximately 400 °C. Lowering the temperature significantly reduces the reaction rate, making the process inefficient. Raising it too high favors the formation of other products. Therefore, 400 °C is the correct temperature that fits the description.\n\n<<<B>>>"
