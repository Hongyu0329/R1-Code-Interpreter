    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the functions and the integrand**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the explicit form of the function F₃(x) by substituting the definitions step by step.\n1.  **F₀(x) = x**\n2.  **F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))** = sin(x)\n3.  **F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))** = e^(sin(x))\n4.  **F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))** = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the integral**\n\nThe integrand is in the form of g'(x)/g(x), where g(x) = F₃(x).\nThe integral of g'(x)/g(x) with respect to x is a standard result:\n∫ (g'(x)/g(x)) dx = ln|g(x)| + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln|F₃(x)|.\n\nNow, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we can simplify this to:\nV = ln( |F₃(1) / F₃(0)| )\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the values of F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\nWe need to evaluate F₃(x) at the limits of integration, x=0 and x=1.\n\n*   **For x = 0:**\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\n    Since sin(0) = 0 and e⁰ = 1:\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **For x = 1:**\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    Note: The argument of the sine function is in radians.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the values back into the expression for V**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for F₃(0) and F₃(1) into the equation for V.\nV = ln( | [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] | )\n\n**Careful Point: Check the sign of the argument**\nFor any real x, sin(x) is between -1 and 1.\nThus, e^(sin(x)) is always positive.\nThis means 1 + e^(sin(x)) > 1.\nAnd therefore, F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) > ln(1) = 0.\nSo, F₃(x) is always positive. The ratio F₃(1)/F₃(0) is also positive, so we can remove the absolute value bars.\n\nV = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / ln(2) )\n\n**Step 5: Perform the numerical calculation for V**\n\nWe will now compute the numerical value using a calculator, ensuring sufficient precision.\n1.  sin(1) ≈ 0.841471\n2.  e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.841471) ≈ 2.320117\n3.  F₃(1) = ln(1 + 2.320117) = ln(3.320117) ≈ 1.200000\n4.  F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693147\n5.  V = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) ) ≈ ln( 1.200000 / 0.693147 ) ≈ ln(1.731274)\n6.  V ≈ 0.548874\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final required value**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548874 = 5488.74\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.74 is 5489.\n\n### Summary of careful points\n*   Correctly identify the integral form ∫(g'/g) dx = ln|g|.\n*   Carefully substitute the functions to find the expression for F₃(x).\n*   Remember that angles in calculus (like in sin(1)) are in radians unless otherwise specified.\n*   Check the domain and sign of the functions inside logarithms to correctly handle absolute values. In this case, F₃(x) is always positive.\n*   Use sufficient precision in numerical calculations to avoid rounding errors.\n*   Correctly apply the final rounding instruction (find the closest integer).\n\n<<<5489>>>"
