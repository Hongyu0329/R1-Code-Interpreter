    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the molecule's composition.**\nThe chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The name describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to analyze its meaning for both heavy atoms (like Carbon) and for Hydrogen.\n\n*   **\"6-\"**: This part describes the core orbitals of heavy atoms. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **\"-31\"**: This part describes the valence orbitals for all atoms. The valence shell is \"split\" into two sets of basis functions:\n    *   The \"inner\" part of the valence shell is described by one CGF, which is a combination of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The \"outer\" part of the valence shell is described by another CGF, which is formed from just 1 primitive Gaussian.\n    *   This \"splitting\" into two functions provides more flexibility for describing chemical bonds.\n*   **\"G\"**: This stands for Gaussian, indicating that Gaussian-type orbitals are used.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) for a single Carbon atom.**\nA Carbon atom (atomic number 6) has a 1s core orbital and 2s, 2p valence orbitals.\n\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** The \"6-\" rule applies. The 1s core orbital is described by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):** The \"-31\" rule applies, meaning the valence orbitals are split.\n    *   The 2s orbital is split into an inner part and an outer part. This results in **2 CGFs** for the 2s orbital.\n    *   The 2p shell consists of three orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). Each of these three p-orbitals is also split into an inner and outer part. This results in 2 CGFs for each p-orbital, for a total of 3 × 2 = **6 CGFs** for the 2p shell.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (from 1s) + 2 (from 2s) + 6 (from 2p) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) for a single Hydrogen atom.**\nA Hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is a valence orbital.\n\n*   **Valence orbital (1s):** The \"-31\" rule applies. The 1s orbital is split into an inner and an outer part.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** This splitting results in **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of CGFs for the toluene molecule (C7H8).**\nNow we multiply the number of CGFs per atom by the number of atoms of that type in the molecule and sum the results.\n\n*   Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**\n*   Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**\n*   **Total number of CGFs:** 63 + 16 = **79 CGFs**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Distinction between Core and Valence:** The basis set treats core and valence electrons differently. The \"6-\" part only applies to the core electrons of heavy atoms (C), not to Hydrogen.\n2.  **Split-Valence Application:** The \"-31\" split applies to the valence orbitals of *all* atoms in the molecule, both Carbon and Hydrogen.\n3.  **Counting All Orbitals:** For Carbon, remember to count the CGFs for the 1s, 2s, and all three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz). A common mistake is to forget that the 2p shell consists of three separate orbitals.\n4.  **Contracted vs. Primitive:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* functions (the final basis functions), not the total number of underlying *primitive* functions (which would be a much larger number). For example, each Carbon atom contributes (1×6) + (1×3 + 1×1) + 3×(1×3 + 1×1) = 6 + 4 + 12 = 22 primitive functions. We are asked for the contracted count, which is 9.\n\n<<<79>>>"
