    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Tensor and Slice Rank\n\nThe tensor $T$ is defined by the function $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$. This tensor is an element of $V_1^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$, where each $V_j^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe **slice rank** of a 3-tensor $T$ is the smallest integer $r$ such that $T$ can be written as a sum of $r$ \"slices\". A slice is a tensor of rank 1 with respect to one of the three partitions of indices, i.e., it can be written in one of the following forms:\n- $A(x) B(y, z)$ (an x-slice)\n- $A(y) B(x, z)$ (a y-slice)\n- $A(z) B(x, y)$ (a z-slice)\nThe slice rank is denoted by $SR(T)$.\n\nThe problem states that the slice rank of this tensor is $SR(T) = (3/2^{K})^n e^{o(n)}$. Our goal is to find $K$. This form implies that we should find the limit $C = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} SR(T)^{1/n}$, and then solve for $K$ from the equation $C = 3/2^K$.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposing the Tensor and Finding an Upper Bound\n\nLet's decompose the tensor $T_n$ into two parts:\n1.  $P_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$\n2.  $\\mathbf{1}(x, y, z) = 1$\n\nSo, $T_n = P_n - \\mathbf{1}$. The slice rank is subadditive, so $SR(T_n) \\le SR(P_n) + SR(\\mathbf{1})$.\n\n*   The tensor $\\mathbf{1}$ is the constant function $1$. It can be written as $f(x)g(y)h(z)$ where $f, g, h$ are all constant functions equal to 1. This means $\\mathbf{1}$ is a rank-1 tensor, and thus a slice. So, $SR(\\mathbf{1}) = 1$.\n\n*   The tensor $P_n$ is the $n$-th tensor power of the base tensor $S_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$. That is, $P_n = S_1^{\\otimes n}$.\n    The slice rank of a tensor product satisfies $SR(A \\otimes B) \\le SR(A) SR(B)$. Therefore, $SR(P_n) = SR(S_1^{\\otimes n}) \\le SR(S_1)^n$.\n\n*   Let's find the slice rank of $S_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1+y_1+z_1$.\n    The slices with respect to the first variable $x_1$ are $S_1(0, y_1, z_1) = y_1+z_1$ and $S_1(1, y_1, z_1) = 1+y_1+z_1$. These two functions are linearly independent. This means the x-slice rank is at least 2.\n    We can write $S_1$ as a sum of two x-slices:\n    $S_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 \\cdot (1) + (1) \\cdot (y_1+z_1)$.\n    Here, $A_1(x_1) = x_1$, $B_1(y_1, z_1)=1$, and $A_2(x_1)=1$, $B_2(y_1,z_1)=y_1+z_1$.\n    This shows the x-slice rank is 2. By symmetry, the y- and z-slice ranks are also 2.\n    The slice rank is at most the minimum of these, so $SR(S_1) \\le 2$. Since it's not 1, we have $SR(S_1) = 2$.\n\n*   Combining these facts, we get an upper bound for $SR(T_n)$:\n    $SR(T_n) \\le SR(S_1)^n + SR(\\mathbf{1}) = 2^n + 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound\n\nA fundamental property of slice rank is that it is greater than or equal to the slice rank with respect to any single variable partition (also known as slice dimension or Schmidt rank for a partition). Let's find the x-slice rank of $T_n$, denoted $r_x(T_n)$.\n\n*   $r_x(T_n)$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by the functions $\\{ T_n(x, \\cdot, \\cdot) \\mid x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n \\}$.\n    This is $\\dim(\\text{span}\\{P_n(x, \\cdot, \\cdot) - \\mathbf{1}(\\cdot, \\cdot) \\mid x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n \\})$.\n\n*   Let $\\mathcal{P} = \\text{span}\\{P_n(x, \\cdot, \\cdot) \\mid x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n \\}$. The dimension of the space of slices of $T_n$ is $\\dim(\\mathcal{P})$ if the constant function $\\mathbf{1}$ is not in $\\mathcal{P}$, and $\\dim(\\mathcal{P}) - 1$ if $\\mathbf{1}$ is in $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\n*   Let's analyze the functions $P_n(x, y, z)$ as functions of $(y,z)$. Let $S_x(y,z) = P_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i + y_i + z_i)$. Let $u_i = y_i+z_i$. The values of $u_i$ are in $\\{0,1,2\\}$. Then $S_x$ can be viewed as a function of $u=(u_1, \\dots, u_n)$.\n    $S_x(u) = \\prod_{i \\in \\text{supp}(x)} (1+u_i) \\prod_{i \\notin \\text{supp}(x)} u_i$.\n    These $2^n$ functions (one for each $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$) correspond to $2^n$ distinct multilinear polynomials in the variables $u_i$. One can show that these polynomials are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{C}$. For example, by showing that the matrix transforming them to the monomial basis is triangular. This means $\\dim(\\mathcal{P}) = 2^n$.\n\n*   Next, we check if the constant function $\\mathbf{1}$ is in $\\mathcal{P}$. It can be shown that it is. For example, for $n=1$, $S_1 - S_0 = (1+y+z) - (y+z) = 1$. In general, $\\mathbf{1} = \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} (-1)^{n-|x|} S_x(y,z)$. Since $\\mathbf{1}$ lies in $\\mathcal{P}$, the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{S_x - \\mathbf{1}\\}$ is one less than the dimension of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\n*   So, $r_x(T_n) = \\dim(\\mathcal{P}) - 1 = 2^n - 1$.\n\n*   Since $SR(T_n) \\ge r_x(T_n)$, we have a lower bound:\n    $SR(T_n) \\ge 2^n - 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Asymptotic Analysis and Final Calculation\n\nWe have established the bounds:\n$2^n - 1 \\le SR(T_n) \\le 2^n + 1$.\n\nTo find the asymptotic behavior, we take the $n$-th root and the limit as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (2^n - 1)^{1/n} \\le \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} SR(T_n)^{1/n} \\le \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (2^n + 1)^{1/n}$.\n\nLet's evaluate the limits of the bounds:\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (2^n - 1)^{1/n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2^n}\\right)^{1/n} = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (2^n + 1)^{1/n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2^n}\\right)^{1/n} = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\nBy the Squeeze Theorem, $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} SR(T_n)^{1/n} = 2$.\nThe factor $e^{o(n)}$ does not affect this limit, as $(\\exp(o(n)))^{1/n} = \\exp(o(1)) \\to e^0 = 1$.\n\nWe are given that the slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The base of this exponential growth is $3/2^K$. So we must have:\n$3/2^K = 2$\n\nNow, we solve for $K$:\n$3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K$\n$3 = 2^{K+1}$\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n$\\log_2(3) = K+1$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\n\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\log_b(m) - \\log_b(n) = \\log_b(m/n)$:\n$K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\n<<<log_2(3/2)>>>"
