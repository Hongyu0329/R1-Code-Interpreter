    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis using the theory of Dirichlet characters.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime factorization of $N$ is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposition of Dirichlet Characters\nA fundamental property of Dirichlet characters is that a character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ with conductors $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$$ \\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\cdot \\chi_{3^2} \\cdot \\chi_{7} \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13} $$\nHere, each $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a primitive character with conductor $p^a$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$$ \\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) $$\nWe are looking for the number of such characters $\\chi$ for which $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Component Characters and their Orders\nWe need to determine the possible orders of the primitive characters for each prime power factor in $N$.\n\n*   **Conductor $2^2=4$**: The group of Dirichlet characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one principal character (order 1) induced from conductor 1, and one primitive character of order 2. So, we must have $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}) = 2$.\n*   **Conductor $3^2=9$**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The characters induced from conductor 3 have orders dividing $\\phi(3)=2$ (i.e., orders 1 and 2). The primitive characters modulo 9 are the remaining characters. In a cyclic group $C_6$, the possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 6. The non-primitive ones have orders 1 and 2. Therefore, the primitive characters modulo 9 must have orders 3 or 6. Thus, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}) \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: A Key Simplification\nFrom Step 3, any primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $N=36036$ must have component characters $\\chi_{2^2}$ with order 2 and $\\chi_{3^2}$ with order 3 or 6. Let's look at the lcm of the orders of just these two components:\n*   If $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}) = 3$, then $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2})) = \\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\n*   If $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}) = 6$, then $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2})) = \\text{lcm}(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nIn both cases, the lcm of the orders of just the first two components is 6. Since the order of the full character $\\chi$ is the lcm of the orders of *all* components, its order must be a multiple of 6.\n\nWe are looking for characters with order *equal* to 6. Given that the order must be a multiple of 6, the condition $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$ is equivalent to the condition $\\text{ord}(\\chi) \\mid 6$.\nFor the lcm of a set of numbers to divide 6, each individual number in the set must divide 6. Therefore, the problem simplifies to counting the number of combinations of primitive characters $(\\chi_{p^a})$ such that the order of each component, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$, divides 6.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Valid Component Characters\nWe will now count, for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **For conductor $2^2=4$**: There is one primitive character, and its order is 2. Since $2 \\mid 6$, this character is a valid choice.\n    Number of choices = 1.\n\n*   **For conductor $3^2=9$**: The primitive characters have orders 3 and 6. Both of these orders divide 6. Therefore, all primitive characters modulo 9 are valid choices. The number of primitive characters modulo 9 is $\\phi^*(9) = \\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = (3^2-3) - (3-1) = 6 - 2 = 4$.\n    Number of choices = 4.\n\n*   **For conductor $7$**: The group of characters is $C_{\\phi(7)} = C_6$. The primitive characters are all characters except the principal one. Their orders are the divisors of 6, other than 1. So, their orders are 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6. So all primitive characters are valid. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi^*(7) = \\phi(7) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$.\n    Number of choices = 5.\n\n*   **For conductor $11$**: The group of characters is $C_{\\phi(11)} = C_{10}$. The primitive characters have orders that are divisors of 10, other than 1. These orders are 2, 5, and 10. We need the orders that divide 6. Of {2, 5, 10}, only 2 divides 6. We need to count the number of primitive characters of order 2. In $C_{10}$, there are $\\phi(2)=1$ such characters.\n    Number of choices = 1.\n\n*   **For conductor $13$**: The group of characters is $C_{\\phi(13)} = C_{12}$. The primitive characters have orders that are divisors of 12, other than 1. These orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We need the orders that divide 6. Of {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}, the orders 2, 3, and 6 divide 6. The number of such characters is the sum of the counts for each order: $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Number of choices = 5.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nThe total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of valid choices for each component character:\nTotal number = (Choices for mod 4) $\\times$ (Choices for mod 9) $\\times$ (Choices for mod 7) $\\times$ (Choices for mod 11) $\\times$ (Choices for mod 13)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
