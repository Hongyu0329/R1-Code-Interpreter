    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s).\n    P1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n          -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n    P2 = [s, 0;\n          -s - 1, 1]\n\n2.  **Definition of GCRD:**\n    - A polynomial matrix R(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if there exists a polynomial matrix Q(s) such that P(s) = Q(s) * R(s).\n    - A polynomial matrix G(s) is a **GCRD** of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a common right divisor of both, and any other common right divisor, D(s), is a right divisor of G(s).\n    - The GCRD is not unique. If G(s) is a GCRD, then any matrix U(s)G(s) is also a GCRD, where U(s) is a unimodular matrix (a square polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). We typically seek the GCRD in a simplified or canonical form.\n\n3.  **Method Selection:** A standard method to find the GCRD is the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves performing elementary row operations on a composite matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2.\n\n4.  **Form the Composite Matrix:** We stack P1 on top of P2 to create a 4x2 matrix M(s).\n    M(s) = [P1; P2] =\n    [ s^2 + s,  -s     ]  (Row 1)\n    [-s^2 - 1,   s^2    ]  (Row 2)\n    [ s,        0      ]  (Row 3)\n    [-s - 1,   1      ]  (Row 4)\n\n5.  **Perform Elementary Row Operations:** The goal is to reduce this matrix to a form [G(s); 0], where G(s) is a 2x2 matrix and 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting G(s) will be a GCRD. Elementary row operations include: (i) swapping two rows, (ii) multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, and (iii) adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n    *   **Step 1:** The rows with the lowest degree are R3 and R4. Let's use R3 `[s, 0]` as a pivot, but it's even better to have a constant as a pivot element if possible. Let's first simplify the matrix.\n        *   Replace R2 with `R2 + R1`: `[s-1, s^2-s]`\n        *   This does not seem to simplify the process significantly. Let's follow a more systematic approach by reducing the degree of the elements.\n\n    *   **Step 2 (A better approach):** Use a lower-degree row to simplify a higher-degree row.\n        *   Replace R1 with `R1 - (s+1) * R3`:\n            [s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s] = [0, -s]\n        *   Replace R2 with `R2 + s * R3`:\n            [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]\n        The matrix becomes:\n        [ 0,      -s     ]\n        [-1,      s^2    ]\n        [ s,       0      ]\n        [-s - 1,  1      ]\n\n    *   **Step 3:** Now we have a row `[-1, s^2]`. The leading constant `-1` makes it an excellent pivot. Let's swap it to the top (R1) and multiply it by -1.\n        The non-zero rows are currently {[0, -s], [-1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s-1, 1]}.\n        Let's arrange them with the new pivot at the top:\n        [ 1,     -s^2     ]  (New R1, from old `R2*(-1)`)\n        [ s,      0       ]  (New R2)\n        [ 0,     -s       ]  (New R3)\n        [-s - 1,  1       ]  (New R4)\n\n    *   **Step 4:** Use the new pivot row `R1 = [1, -s^2]` to eliminate the first element in other rows.\n        *   Replace R2 with `R2 - s * R1`:\n            [s, 0] - s[1, -s^2] = [s - s, 0 - s(-s^2)] = [0, s^3]\n        *   Replace R4 with `R4 + (s+1) * R1`:\n            [-s - 1, 1] + (s+1)[1, -s^2] = [-s-1+s+1, 1 + (s+1)(-s^2)] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]\n        The matrix becomes:\n        [ 1,   -s^2           ]\n        [ 0,   s^3            ]\n        [ 0,   -s             ]\n        [ 0,  -s^3 - s^2 + 1   ]\n\n    *   **Step 5:** Now we operate on the second column. The simplest row is `R3 = [0, -s]`. Let's use it as our pivot. Let's move it to R2 and multiply by -1.\n        The rows with a leading zero are {[0, s^3], [0, s], [0, -s^3-s^2+1]}.\n        The matrix of these \"sub-rows\" is:\n        [ 1,   -s^2           ]\n        [ 0,   s              ] (New R2, from old `R3*(-1)`)\n        [ 0,   s^3            ]\n        [ 0,  -s^3 - s^2 + 1   ]\n\n    *   **Step 6:** Use the new pivot `R2 = [0, s]` to simplify other rows.\n        *   Replace R3 with `R3 - s^2 * R2`:\n            [0, s^3] - s^2[0, s] = [0, 0]\n        *   Replace R4 with `R4 + (s^2 + s) * R2`:\n            [0, -s^3-s^2+1] + (s^2+s)[0, s] = [0, -s^3-s^2+1 + s^3+s^2] = [0, 1]\n        *   Replace R1 with `R1 + s * R2`:\n            [1, -s^2] + s[0, s] = [1, -s^2 + s^2] = [1, 0]\n        The matrix of non-zero rows becomes:\n        [ 1,  0 ]\n        [ 0,  s ]\n        [ 0,  1 ]\n\n    *   **Step 7:** We have a new, very simple pivot row `[0, 1]`. Use it to eliminate the 's' in `[0, s]`.\n        *   Take `R_new = [0, s]` and replace it with `R_new - s * [0, 1]`:\n            [0, s] - s[0, 1] = [0, 0]\n        The final set of non-zero rows is:\n        [ 1,  0 ]\n        [ 0,  1 ]\n\n6.  **Final Result:** The row reduction process has transformed the composite matrix into a form where the non-zero part is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    G(s) = [ 1, 0;\n             0, 1 ]\n\nThis means the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the identity matrix, I. When the GCRD is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the original matrices are said to be **right co-prime**.\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
