    "Answering this puzzle requires uncovering the hidden rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. The transformation always involves the number '2' moving to a new position. Let's analyze the provided examples step by step.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Transformation:** In both `Input_A` -> `Output_A` and `Input_B` -> `Output_B`, the grid changes in two places: a `2` turns into a `0`, and a `0` turns into a `2`. This indicates that the `2` \"moves\" or swaps its position with a `0`. The core of the puzzle is to determine which `0` the `2` will swap with. The `1`s act as static obstacles.\n\n2.  **Analyze Input A:**\n    *   Input: `001111,121111,111111`\n    *   Grid form:\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 2 1 1 1 1  (2 is at row 1, col 1)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   Output: `201111,101111,111111`\n    *   The `2` from `(1,1)` moves to `(0,0)`.\n    *   Let's examine the neighbors of the `2` at `(1,1)` that are `0`. They are at `(0,0)` and `(0,1)`. Out of these two options, `(0,0)` was chosen. This position is to the top-left of the `2`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Input B:**\n    *   Input: `0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111`\n    *   Grid form (relevant part):\n        ```\n        ...0 0 0 0... (row 2)\n        ...0 2 1...   (2 is at row 3, col 6)\n        ...1 1 1...\n        ```\n    *   Output: The `2` from `(3,6)` moves to `(2,7)`.\n    *   Let's examine the neighbors of the `2` at `(3,6)` that are `0`. They are at `(2,5)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,7)`, and `(3,5)`. Out of these four options, `(2,7)` was chosen. This position is to the top-right of the `2`.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:**\n    *   In A, the move was Top-Left. In B, the move was Top-Right. The choice is not as simple as picking the first available `0` in reading order.\n    *   There must be a rule that dictates the search direction. Let's look at the coordinates of the `2` (using 0-based indexing).\n        *   In A: `(1, 4)`. This is (odd row, even column). WRONG. A has `(1,1)`. Let's recheck coords. `121111`. No, this is wrong. `1` then `2` means `(1,1)` if we see this as 1D index, but grid-wise it is `(1,1)`.\n        *   Re-checking coordinates. In A, `2` is at `(1,1)`. This is (odd, odd).\n        *   In B, `2` is at `(3,6)`. This is (odd, even).\n    *   The parity (odd/even) of the coordinates seems to determine the search priority for finding a `0` to move to.\n    *   **Rule Hypothesis:**\n        *   If the `2` is at an **(odd, odd)** coordinate (like in A), the search order for an empty (`0`) neighbor is: **Top-Left, Left, Bottom-Left, Top, Bottom, Top-Right, Right, Bottom-Right.**\n        *   If the `2` is at an **(odd, even)** coordinate (like in B), the search order is: **Top-Right, Right, Bottom-Right, Top, Bottom, Top-Left, Left, Bottom-Left.**\n    *   **Verification:**\n        *   Case A `(1,1)` is (odd, odd). Search order starts with Top-Left. The neighbor at `(0,0)` is `0`. The rule selects it. This matches the output.\n        *   Case B `(3,6)` is (odd, even). Search order starts with Top-Right. The neighbor at `(2,7)` is `0`. The rule selects it. This matches the output.\n    *   The hypothesis is consistent with the provided examples.\n\n5.  **Solve for Input C:**\n    *   Input: `000000,011120,111111`\n    *   Grid form:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 2 0  (2 is at row 1, col 4)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The `2` is at coordinate `(1,4)`. This is an **(odd, even)** coordinate, the same type as in Input B.\n    *   Therefore, we must use the second search order: `Top-Right, Right, Bottom-Right, ...`\n    *   Let's check the neighbors of `(1,4)` in that order:\n        1.  **Top-Right** `(0,5)`: The value in the grid at `(0,5)` is `0`.\n    *   We have found our destination. The `2` will move from `(1,4)` to `(0,5)`.\n    *   The original cell of the `2`, `(1,4)`, will become `0`.\n    *   The destination cell, `(0,5)`, will become `2`.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Output:**\n    *   Original Row 0: `000000` -> changes at index 5 -> `000002`\n    *   Original Row 1: `011120` -> changes at index 4 -> `011100`\n    *   Original Row 2: `111111` -> no changes -> `111111`\n    *   Combining these rows into the required string format gives: `000002,011100,111111`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
