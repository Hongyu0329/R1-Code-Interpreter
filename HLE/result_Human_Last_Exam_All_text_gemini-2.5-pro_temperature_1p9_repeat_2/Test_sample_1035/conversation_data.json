    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35\".\n\n*   **\\( K_{35} \\)**: A complete graph with 35 vertices. Every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   **Family of Bipartite Graphs:** A set of graphs \\( G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k \\), where each \\( G_i \\) is bipartite.\n*   **Covering all the edges:** The union of the edge sets of all graphs \\( G_i \\) in the family must contain all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\). That is, \\( E(K_{35}) = \\cup_{i=1}^k E(G_i) \\).\n*   **\"Minimum number of vertices\"**: This phrase is slightly ambiguous.\n    *   If it means the total number of distinct vertices used across the entire family, the answer must be 35. To cover an edge connected to a vertex, that vertex must be included. Since every vertex in \\( K_{35} \\) has edges connected to it, all 35 vertices must be part of the vertex set of the covering family. This interpretation makes the problem trivial.\n    *   A much more common and standard problem in graph theory is to find the *minimum number of bipartite graphs* in such a covering family. This is known as the **bipartite dimension** or **biclique cover number** of \\(K_n\\). The wording \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" is very likely a slight misstatement of this standard problem. We will proceed with this standard interpretation, as it leads to a non-trivial mathematical question.\n\n**Let's rephrase the problem:** What is the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs of \\(K_{35}\\) whose union contains all edges of \\(K_{35}\\)?\n\n**2. Core Logic and Establishing a Lower Bound**\n\nLet \\(k\\) be the minimum number of bipartite graphs required. Let the family of graphs be \\( \\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\} \\). The vertices of all these graphs are the 35 vertices of \\( K_{35} \\), let's call this set \\(V\\).\n\n*   For each bipartite graph \\( G_i \\), we can partition its vertex set \\(V\\) into two disjoint sets, let's call them \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\), such that every edge in \\( G_i \\) connects a vertex in \\( A_i \\) to a vertex in \\( B_i \\).\n*   We can use this partitioning to assign a binary \"label\" to each vertex for each graph. For a given graph \\(G_i\\), we can assign the label `0` to every vertex in \\(A_i\\) and `1` to every vertex in \\(B_i\\).\n*   By doing this for all \\(k\\) graphs, we can associate each vertex \\(v \\in V\\) with a unique binary vector of length \\(k\\). The \\(i\\)-th component of this vector is `0` if \\(v \\in A_i\\) and `1` if \\(v \\in B_i\\).\n*   Now, consider any two distinct vertices, say \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). In the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\), there is an edge between them. This edge, \\((u,v)\\), must be covered by at least one of the bipartite graphs in our family, say \\(G_j\\).\n*   Since \\((u,v)\\) is an edge in the bipartite graph \\(G_j\\), \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) must belong to different partitions in \\(G_j\\). One must be in \\(A_j\\) and the other in \\(B_j\\).\n*   This means their \\(j\\)-th binary labels must be different (one is `0`, the other is `1`). Consequently, the binary vector associated with \\(u\\) must be different from the binary vector associated with \\(v\\).\n*   Since this must hold for *any* pair of distinct vertices, it means that all 35 vertices of \\(K_{35}\\) must be assigned a unique binary vector of length \\(k\\).\n*   The total number of distinct binary vectors of length \\(k\\) is \\(2^k\\).\n*   To assign a unique vector to each of the 35 vertices, we must have at least 35 distinct vectors. This gives us the inequality:\n    \\( 2^k \\ge 35 \\)\n\n**3. Solving for the Minimum Number, k**\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(2^k \\ge 35\\).\n\n*   Let's check the powers of 2:\n    *   \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n    *   \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n    *   \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n    *   \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n    *   \\(2^5 = 32\\)  (This is not greater than or equal to 35, so \\(k=5\\) is not enough).\n    *   \\(2^6 = 64\\)  (This is greater than or equal to 35, so \\(k=6\\) is potentially the answer).\n\nFrom this, the minimum possible integer value for \\(k\\) is 6. Mathematically, this is \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2(35) \\rceil \\).\n\n**4. Proving Sufficiency**\n\nWe have shown that \\(k\\) must be at least 6. Now we must confirm that 6 is sufficient. We can do this with a constructive argument.\n\n*   Let \\(k = 6\\). We have \\(2^6 = 64\\) available unique binary vectors of length 6.\n*   Assign a distinct 6-bit binary vector to each of the 35 vertices of \\(K_{35}\\). This is possible since \\(64 > 35\\).\n*   Construct 6 bipartite graphs, \\(G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_6\\).\n*   For each graph \\(G_i\\) (\\(1 \\le i \\le 6\\)), define the partitions \\(A_i\\) and \\(B_i\\) as follows:\n    *   \\(A_i = \\{ \\text{vertices whose assigned binary vector has a '0' in the } i\\text{-th position} \\}\\)\n    *   \\(B_i = \\{ \\text{vertices whose assigned binary vector has a '1' in the } i\\text{-th position} \\}\\)\n*   Define the edge set of \\(G_i\\) to include every possible edge between a vertex in \\(A_i\\) and a vertex in \\(B_i\\).\n*   Now, take any edge \\((u,v)\\) from \\(K_{35}\\). Since the binary vectors for \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are distinct, they must differ in at least one position, say the \\(j\\)-th position.\n*   This means one of \\(u\\) or \\(v\\) is in \\(A_j\\) and the other is in \\(B_j\\). By our construction, the edge \\((u,v)\\) is included in the graph \\(G_j\\).\n*   Therefore, the union of the edges of \\(G_1, \\ldots, G_6\\) covers all edges of \\(K_{35}\\).\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have established that at least 6 bipartite graphs are necessary and that 6 are also sufficient. Thus, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover the edges of \\(K_{35}\\) is 6.\n\n### Careful Points Checklist\n\n1.  **Question Interpretation:** The most critical step is interpreting the phrase \"minimum number of vertices in a family\". Interpreting it as the \"minimum number of graphs in a family\" is the standard approach that leads to a solvable, non-trivial problem.\n2.  **Covering vs. Partitioning:** The problem specifies \"covering\". Our proof constructs graphs whose edges may overlap. However, the lower bound argument holds for both covering and partitioning, and the answer is the same.\n3.  **Bipartite vs. Complete Bipartite:** Our proof uses complete bipartite graphs for the construction. This is valid since a complete bipartite graph is a type of bipartite graph. This construction ensures all required edges are present.\n4.  **Inequality:** The core of the problem boils down to solving the inequality \\(2^k \\ge n\\), where \\(n=35\\). The solution must be an integer, so we need the ceiling function: \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil\\).\n\nThe final answer is the minimum integer \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(2^k \\ge 35\\), which is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
