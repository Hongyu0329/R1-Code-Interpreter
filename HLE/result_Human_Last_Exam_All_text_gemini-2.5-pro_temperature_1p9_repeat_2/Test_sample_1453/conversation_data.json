    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Coiled-Coil Structure**\n\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where alpha-helices are coiled together like a rope. Their structure is primarily defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Hydrophobic Core:** The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic. They are buried in the core of the structure, away from water.\n*   **Knobs-into-Holes Packing:** The stability of a coiled-coil comes from the efficient packing of side chains from one helix into the spaces on the adjacent helix. The side chain of an `a` or `d` residue (the \"knob\") packs into a cavity or \"hole\" formed by side chains on the neighboring helix.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** The number of helices in the coiled-coil (e.g., dimer, trimer, tetramer) is strongly influenced by the specific amino acids found at the `a` and `d` core positions. Different amino acid combinations have different packing efficiencies for different oligomeric states.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Heptad Repeat Frame for the Given Sequence**\n\nThe provided sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, which is 30 amino acids long. This suggests it's composed of four full heptad repeats (4 x 7 = 28) with two flanking residues. To determine the oligomeric state, we must first correctly identify which residues fall into the `a` and `d` positions. We do this by finding the frame that places hydrophobic residues most consistently in the `a` and `d` positions. The spacing is key: there are two residues between `a` and `d` (`a-b-c-d`) and three residues between `d` and the `a` of the next heptad (`d-e-f-g-a`).\n\nLet's search for a repeating `H-x-x-H-x-x-x` pattern where H is a large hydrophobic residue (like L, I, W).\n\nSequence: `G E I A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G`\n\n*   Let's test the hypothesis that Leucine (L) at position 7 is at an `a` position and Isoleucine (I) at position 10 is at a `d` position.\n    *   `L(7)` to `I(10)` has 2 residues (`K`, `E`) in between. This fits the `a` to `d` spacing (`a-b-c-d`).\n*   Let's check the next pair from `I(10)` to the next hydrophobic residue, `L(14)`.\n    *   `I(10)` to `L(14)` has 3 residues (`A`, `K`, `S`) in between. This fits the `d` to `a` spacing (`d-e-f-g-a`).\n\nThis framing is consistent throughout the sequence. Let's list all the core positions based on this register:\n\n*   **`a` positions:** L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28)\n*   **`d` positions:** I(10), I(17), I(24)\n\nThis yields a hydrophobic core composed entirely of Leucine at the `a` positions and Isoleucine at the `d` positions.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Core Residues (`a` and `d`) to Predict the Oligomeric State**\n\nThe specific identity of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions dictates the preferred packing geometry and thus the oligomeric state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Different oligomers have different packing preferences.**\n    *   **Dimers (2 helices):** Typically feature an *asymmetric* core. A common motif is a large, beta-branched residue (like Isoleucine or Valine) at the `a` position and the large, flexible Leucine at the `d` position (`a=I/V`, `d=L`). This allows for classic knobs-into-holes packing.\n    *   **Trimers (3 helices) and Tetramers (4 helices):** Often feature a more *symmetrical* core where positions `a` and `d` are both occupied by large, similarly sized hydrophobic residues like Isoleucine and Leucine.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The packing efficiency of our `a=L, d=I` core.**\n    *   Our sequence has **`a=L`** and **`d=I`**.\n    *   This combination of two large, bulky hydrophobic residues at both core positions creates a very dense, stable core.\n    *   Experimental studies and structural analysis have shown that this specific combination (`a=L, d=I`) provides exceptionally good packing efficiency for a **trimeric** (3-helix) coiled-coil. The symmetrical arrangement allows the side chains of the three helices to interdigitate nearly perfectly, minimizing buried empty space and maximizing favorable hydrophobic interactions.\n    *   While this combination might hypothetically form a dimer or tetramer, it is a hallmark signature of a trimer.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence analysis reveals a clear heptad repeat with Leucine (L) at the `a` positions and Isoleucine (I) at the `d` positions. Based on established principles of coiled-coil stability and knobs-into-holes packing efficiency, this `a=L`, `d=I` core composition strongly favors the formation of a **trimer**.\n\nThe predicted oligomeric state is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
