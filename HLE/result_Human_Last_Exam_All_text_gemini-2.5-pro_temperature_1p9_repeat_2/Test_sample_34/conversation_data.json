    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB deep cash game. This is a standard stack depth, so typical Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles apply.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker. You have a positional advantage, acting last post-flop, which allows you to realize your equity much more effectively. Consequently, the button has the widest opening range of any position.\n    *   **Action:** Opening to 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard raise size and fits within GTO strategies.\n    *   **Key Condition: Rake-Free.** This is the most critical detail. Rake is the fee the house takes from the pot. Without rake, the threshold for a hand to be profitable is significantly lower. Hands that might be break-even or slightly losing in a raked game become profitable opens. This effect is most pronounced on the button, leading to an extremely wide opening range.\n    *   **Hand in Question:** We need to find the \"worst suited jack\" (JXs) that is a standard open-raise in this specific scenario.\n\n2.  **Ranking Suited Jacks:**\n    *   Suited Jacks (JXs) are ranked primarily by the value of their second card (the \"kicker\") and their ability to connect to make straights.\n    *   The ranking, from best to worst, is: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    *   JTs is the best due to its high kicker and ability to make the nut straight. As the kicker decreases, the hand gets weaker. J2s has the lowest kicker and very poor connectivity for making straights.\n\n3.  **Applying the Rake-Free Condition:**\n    *   In a typical *raked* game, the button opens about 40-50% of hands. The bottom of the suited Jack range that is opened is often around J5s or J4s, with J3s and J2s being marginal folds or mixed strategies (raise sometimes, fold other times).\n    *   However, in a *rake-free* environment, the button's opening range expands dramatically. The combination of having the best position and no rake penalty makes it profitable to open almost any two suited cards.\n    *   GTO solvers for this specific scenario (100BB, Rake-Free, Button Open) confirm that the button should be opening an extremely wide range, often exceeding 60-70% of hands. This range includes **all** suited Jacks.\n\n4.  **Identifying the \"Worst\" Hand to Open:**\n    *   The question asks for the worst suited jack you *should open*. Since the GTO strategy for this rake-free scenario is to open *all* suited jacks from JTs down to J2s, we need to identify the objectively weakest hand within that group.\n    *   As established in the ranking, J2s is the weakest hand in the JXs category due to its low kicker and poor connectivity.\n    *   Because it is still a standard, profitable open-raise in this rake-free game, J2s is the correct answer. It is the lowest-ranked hand in its category that is still part of the opening range.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
