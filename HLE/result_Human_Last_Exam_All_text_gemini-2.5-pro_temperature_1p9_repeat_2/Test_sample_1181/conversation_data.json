    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key identifying detail is a specific emotional state: the character is \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This implies a character who has been away from Earth for a long time and feels that their nostalgia for simple, natural things is a sign of weakness or a betrayal of their scientific mission.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Characters:**\n    *   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist who has just arrived at the Solaris station from Earth. The beginning of the film extensively features the natural environment of his home on Earth, including the sounds of nature. While he certainly misses Earth, he has only been on the station for a short time. The feeling of being \"ashamed\" of this nostalgia is more characteristic of someone who has been trying to suppress it for a much longer period.\n    *   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories of his deceased wife, created by the Solaris ocean. She has no genuine memories of Earth herself. Her entire existence is confined to the station and is built from Kris's mind. Therefore, she cannot miss something she has never experienced.\n    *   **C. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is a cyberneticist and one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He has been on the station for a long time and is weary, jaded, and philosophical. He often acts as a guide to Kris, explaining the psychological toll of their situation. In a key conversation with Kris, Snaut confesses his exhaustion and longing for home. He describes his nostalgia as \"simple-minded\" and admits that he is \"ashamed\" to feel this way, as if this very human longing is a professional or intellectual failure. He explicitly mentions missing simple terrestrial sensations.\n    *   **D. Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is the other surviving scientist, a biologist. He is portrayed as rigid, emotionally detached, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of Solaris. He views the \"visitors\" as a problem to be solved or eliminated. Admitting to a sentimental weakness like being \"ashamed to miss\" something as mundane as leaves rustling would be highly out of character for him.\n    *   **E. Gibarian:** Dr. Gibarian is the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video recording he left for Kris. While he is clearly in despair, his message is a direct warning about the planet and its phenomena, not a reflection on nostalgia.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Scene:** The line in question comes from a conversation between Kris Kelvin and Dr. Snaut. Snaut is trying to explain the psychological pressure they are all under. He says, *\"We don't want to conquer the cosmos, we want to extend the Earth to the borders of the cosmos... We're in the foolish position of a man striving for a goal he fears and doesn't want. Man needs man.\"* In this context, he confesses his own \"simple-minded nostalgia\" and expresses his shame over having such an ordinary human feeling after dedicating his life to a cosmic mission.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the character analysis and the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Film Version:** It is crucial to focus on Tarkovsky's 1972 film, not the Stanislaw Lem novel or the 2002 American remake, as characterizations and specific dialogue can differ.\n*   **The Emotion of \"Shame\":** The key is not just *missing* Earth, but being *ashamed* of it. This points to a character with a strong sense of scientific or intellectual duty who sees this human emotion as a failing. This perfectly fits Snaut's world-weary intellectual character.\n*   **Character Arcs:** Kris is on a journey of discovering these feelings, whereas Snaut has been living with them for years, leading to his complex mix of nostalgia and shame. Hari is an external entity who cannot have these feelings. Sartorius actively suppresses them.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
