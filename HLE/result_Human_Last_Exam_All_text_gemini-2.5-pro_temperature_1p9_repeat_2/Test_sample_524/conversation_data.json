    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of spaces that satisfy three specific properties:\n1.  They are **continua**.\n2.  They are **planar**.\n3.  They are **homogeneous**.\n\nLet's break down each of these terms.\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a nonempty, compact, and connected metric space.\n    *   *Compact* in the context of the plane ($R^2$) means the set is closed and bounded.\n    *   *Connected* means the set cannot be split into two disjoint nonempty open subsets. Intuitively, it is \"all in one piece.\"\n\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means there is a homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) from the space to a subset of $R^2$. The question essentially asks us to consider continua that are subsets of the plane.\n\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism from X to itself that maps x to y. This is a very strong symmetry condition, meaning the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** Two spaces are in the same homeomorphism class if they are topologically equivalent (i.e., there is a homeomorphism between them). The question asks for the total number of such distinct classes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua is a deep and celebrated result in point-set topology, established through the cumulative work of several mathematicians over decades, including R. H. Moore, R. L. Moore, S. Mazurkiewicz, R. H. Bing, F. B. Jones, and finalized by J. T. Rogers, Jr.\n\nWe can find the answer by systematically considering the possible structures of such spaces.\n\n**Step 1: The Degenerate Case**\n\nThe simplest possible continuum is a single point.\n*   A point is a nonempty, compact, and connected subset of the plane.\n*   It is obviously planar.\n*   It is trivially homogeneous: for any two points x and y in a one-point space, we must have x=y. The identity map is a homeomorphism that maps x to y.\nTherefore, the **single point** forms one homeomorphism class.\n\n**Step 2: The Non-Degenerate Cases and the Role of Arcs**\n\nNow, let's consider continua that consist of more than one point (non-degenerate continua). A crucial question is whether such a space contains an arc (a subspace homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1]).\n\n*   **Case A: The continuum contains an arc.**\n    A major theorem by R.H. Bing (1960) states that a homogeneous planar continuum that contains an arc must be a **simple closed curve** (homeomorphic to a circle, $S^1$).\n    *   The circle is indeed a compact, connected, planar space.\n    *   It is also homogeneous: for any two points on a circle, one can be rotated to the other, which is a homeomorphism of the circle onto itself.\n    This gives us our second homeomorphism class: **the circle**.\n\n*   **Case B: The continuum does not contain any arc.**\n    A continuum that contains no arcs is called *arcwise-disconnected* or *punctiform*. Any such homogeneous planar continua must be highly complex, \"fractal-like\" objects. The theory of indecomposable continua becomes central here. (A continuum is *indecomposable* if it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua). All homogeneous arcwise-disconnected continua are indecomposable. The classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua tells us there are exactly two possibilities in this category.\n\n**Step 3: The Arcwise-Disconnected Cases**\n\n1.  **The Pseudo-arc:**\n    This is a famous mathematical object, first described by B. Knaster. R.H. Bing proved that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous and that it is the *unique* chainable, arcwise-disconnected, indecomposable continuum (up to homeomorphism). It is known to be embeddable in the plane. It does not separate the plane.\n    This gives us our third homeomorphism class: **the pseudo-arc**.\n\n2.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    This is another indecomposable continuum, first constructed by R.H. Bing and F.B. Jones. It is a homogeneous planar continuum that, unlike the pseudo-arc, separates the plane into two connected components. It can be thought of as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle. It is topologically distinct from the point, the circle, and the pseudo-arc.\n    This gives us our fourth and final homeomorphism class: **the circle of pseudo-arcs**.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\n\nThe complete classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua, established by the work of J. T. Rogers, Jr. in the 1980s, confirms that the list is complete. There are no other possibilities.\n\nThe four distinct homeomorphism classes are:\n\n1.  **The Point** (the only degenerate example)\n2.  **The Circle** (the only example containing an arc)\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc** (an arcwise-disconnected example that does not separate the plane)\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs** (an arcwise-disconnected example that separates the plane)\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 4 homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
