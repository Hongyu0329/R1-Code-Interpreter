    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the mechanism that is *most likely* responsible for two specific outcomes following a gene duplication event in eukaryotes:\n1.  **Retention:** Both copies of the duplicated gene are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than one being lost (which is the most common fate).\n2.  **Divergence:** The two retained copies accumulate differences in their sequence and/or function.\n\nWe need to evaluate each answer choice to see how well it explains both retention and divergence, and which one is considered the most probable.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, it tends to make the two copies *more similar* to each other, not more divergent. It acts as a force of homogenization, working against divergence. Therefore, it does not explain the divergence of duplicate genes and is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one of the duplicate genes accumulates deleterious mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts) that render it non-functional. The non-functional copy is called a pseudogene. While this is the most common fate of a duplicate gene, it describes the *loss* of a functional gene, not its *retention* as a working gene. The question is about the retention of functional duplicates, so this is not the correct mechanism.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that after duplication, one copy maintains the original, essential function, while the second copy is initially redundant. This redundancy frees the second copy from strong purifying selection, allowing it to accumulate mutations. A rare mutation may arise that confers a new, beneficial function. This new function would then be preserved by positive selection. This model successfully explains both **retention** (one copy kept for the original function, the second for the new function) and **divergence** (the sequence changes that create the new function). This is a plausible mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model):** This model starts with an ancestral gene that has multiple functions or is expressed in multiple tissues/developmental stages (pleiotropy). After duplication, both copies are initially redundant. Then, each copy can independently accumulate degenerative mutations that knock out *different* subfunctions. For example, copy 1 might lose the ability to function in tissue A, while copy 2 loses the ability to function in tissue B. Now, both genes are required to carry out the full set of the original ancestral gene's functions. Both are \"complemented\" by the other. This explains **retention** because both copies are now indispensable and under purifying selection. It also explains **divergence**, as they have diverged in their regulatory elements and/or coding sequences to specialize in different subfunctions.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a single ancestral lineage into many new species that fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that *facilitates* adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is a pattern of speciation, not a molecular mechanism that acts on individual genes to cause their retention and divergence. This is the wrong level of biological organization.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Plausible Mechanisms (C and D) and Determine the \"Most Likely\" One\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks which is \"most likely.\"\n\n*   **The challenge for Neofunctionalization:** In this model, the duplicate gene is initially redundant and evolutionarily neutral. This means it's highly likely to accumulate disabling mutations and become a pseudogene before a rare, beneficial, new-function mutation can occur. For the gene to be retained, the new beneficial function has to evolve relatively quickly.\n*   **The advantage of Subfunctionalization:** This model provides a passive, non-adaptive path to preservation. The degenerative mutations that knock out subfunctions are much more common than gain-of-function mutations. Once complementary mutations occur in the two copies, both become essential and are protected from being lost. This provides a \"safe harbor\" for duplicate genes, locking them into the genome. This initial retention via subfunctionalization then allows more time for further divergence, which could even lead to neofunctionalization later on.\n\nBecause the process of subfunctionalization relies on more common loss-of-function mutations and doesn't require a rare, immediate gain-of-function mutation to save the duplicate from extinction, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more common and thus **more likely** primary mechanism for the retention of duplicate genes.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nSubfunctionalization provides a robust and highly probable route for preserving duplicate genes from the outset, allowing for their subsequent divergence. It partitions existing functions, a process driven by common degenerative mutations, thereby ensuring the retention of both copies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
