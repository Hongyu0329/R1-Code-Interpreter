    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for the total number of identified members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family specifically in humans. \"To date\" implies the need for the most current, scientifically accepted count.\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 family member\":** This is a crucial point. The term \"member\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n    *   **Distinct mature miRNA sequences:** These are the final, functional miRNA molecules. In the let-7 family, these are named let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, etc.\n    *   **Distinct miRNA genes (loci):** These are the specific locations in the genome that code for the let-7 miRNAs. Some mature miRNAs (like let-7a) are coded by more than one gene. In genomics, when counting members of a gene family, the number of distinct genes is typically used. This is the more precise interpretation.\n\n3.  **Identify the members based on mature sequence type:** The human let-7 family is defined by a shared seed sequence. Based on their slightly different mature sequences, the following members are recognized:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n    *   miR-98 (This miRNA shares the let-7 seed sequence and is considered a member of the family).\n    This gives a total of **9** distinct types of mature let-7 family miRNAs.\n\n4.  **Identify the members based on distinct gene loci:** Now, we will count the number of individual genes that produce these miRNAs. We consult the authoritative miRNA database, miRBase, for this information.\n    *   **let-7a** is produced by 3 distinct genes:\n        1.  `let-7a-1`\n        2.  `let-7a-2`\n        3.  `let-7a-3`\n    *   **let-7f** is produced by 2 distinct genes:\n        4.  `let-7f-1`\n        5.  `let-7f-2`\n    *   **let-7b** is produced by 1 gene:\n        6.  `let-7b`\n    *   **let-7c** is produced by 1 gene:\n        7.  `let-7c`\n    *   **let-7d** is produced by 1 gene:\n        8.  `let-7d`\n    *   **let-7e** is produced by 1 gene:\n        9.  `let-7e`\n    *   **let-7g** is produced by 1 gene:\n        10. `let-7g`\n    *   **let-7i** is produced by 1 gene:\n        11. `let-7i`\n    *   **miR-98** is produced by 1 gene:\n        12. `miR-98`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** Summing up the number of distinct genes (loci): 3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 1 (for let-7b) + 1 (for let-7c) + 1 (for let-7d) + 1 (for let-7e) + 1 (for let-7g) + 1 (for let-7i) + 1 (for miR-98) = 12.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Member\":** The primary point of care is clarifying whether \"member\" refers to the mature product or the gene. As established, counting the distinct genes (12) is the standard and more informative answer for a gene family.\n*   **Inclusion of miR-98:** It's important to remember that miR-98 is part of the let-7 family due to its functional similarity (shared seed sequence), even though its name is different.\n*   **Data Source:** The count is based on information from established and curated biological databases like miRBase, which is the primary repository for miRNA data. The number has remained stable for many years.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis concludes that while there are 9 types of mature let-7 family miRNAs distinguished by name, they are encoded by a total of 12 distinct genes located across the human genome. Therefore, the total number of let-7 family members identified in humans is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
