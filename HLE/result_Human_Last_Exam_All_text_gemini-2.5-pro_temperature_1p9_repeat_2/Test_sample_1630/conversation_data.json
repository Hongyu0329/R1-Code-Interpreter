    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$.\n\n**1. Define the Problem and the Functions**\n\n*   We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\n*   Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ with $a \\neq 0$.\n*   Let $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$ with $p \\neq 0$.\n*   We are given that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c > 0$. For this quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$).\n    *   $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r > 0$. Similarly, this requires $p > 0$ and $q^2 < 3pr$.\n*   A positive derivative for all $x$ means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n*   We want to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n**2. Determine the Degree of the Equation for Fixed Points**\n\n*   The function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a composition of two degree-3 polynomials.\n*   The degree of $h(x)$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n*   Degree of $h(x) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, which can be written as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n*   This is a polynomial equation of degree 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$ is 9.\n\n**3. Use the Derivative to Verify the Upper Bound**\n\n*   We need to determine if the constraints $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ reduce this maximum possible number.\n*   Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Let's analyze its derivative using the chain rule:\n    $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n*   Since we are given that $f'(y) > 0$ for any real number $y$, it must be true for $y=g(x)$. So, $f'(g(x)) > 0$.\n*   We are also given $g'(x) > 0$.\n*   The product of two positive numbers is positive, so $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n*   Suppose $f(g(x))$ has $N$ distinct fixed points, $x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_N$.\n*   This means $h(x_i) = x_i$ for each $i=1, \\dots, N$.\n*   Consider any two consecutive fixed points, $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$. By the Mean Value Theorem applied to the function $h(x)$ on the interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, there must exist a point $c_i \\in (x_i, x_{i+1})$ such that:\n    $h'(c_i) = \\frac{h(x_{i+1}) - h(x_i)}{x_{i+1} - x_i} = \\frac{x_{i+1} - x_i}{x_{i+1} - x_i} = 1$.\n*   This means that if there are $N$ fixed points, there must be at least $N-1$ distinct real solutions to the equation $h'(x) = 1$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Equation $h'(x) = 1$**\n\n*   Let's determine the degree of the polynomial $h'(x)$.\n    *   $g(x)$ is degree 3, so $g'(x)$ is degree 2. ($g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$)\n    *   $f(y)$ is degree 3, so $f'(y)$ is degree 2. ($f'(y) = 3ay^2 + 2by + c$)\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ is the composition of a degree-2 polynomial with a degree-3 polynomial, so its degree is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. The degree of $h'(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of its factors: $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   The equation $h'(x) = 1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8.\n*   A degree-8 polynomial equation can have at most 8 real roots.\n*   So, we must have $N-1 \\le 8$, which implies $N \\le 9$.\n*   This analysis confirms that 9 is a strict upper bound on the number of fixed points.\n\n**5. Argue that the Maximum is Achievable**\n\n*   The question now is whether it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and result in 9 fixed points.\n*   To have 9 fixed points, we would need the equation $h'(x)=1$ to have 8 distinct real roots.\n*   Let's analyze the derivative of $h'(x)$, which is $h''(x)$. The number of real roots of $h''(x)$ limits the number of local extrema of $h'(x)$, which in turn limits the number of times it can equal 1.\n*   $h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x)) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n*   $f''(x)$ is degree 1, and $g''(x)$ is degree 1. The degree of $h''(x)$ is 7.\n*   A polynomial of degree 7 can have up to 7 distinct real roots. If $h''(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots, then $h'(x)$ can have up to 7 local extrema.\n*   A function with 7 local extrema can intersect a horizontal line (like $y=1$) at most 8 times.\n*   Therefore, it is theoretically possible for $h'(x)=1$ to have 8 distinct real roots.\n*   If we can find $f$ and $g$ such that $h'(x)=1$ has 8 distinct real roots, say $c_1, \\dots, c_8$, then the function $k(x) = f(g(x))-x$ has 8 local extrema.\n*   The function $k(x)$ tends to $-\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to +\\infty$ (since its leading term is $ap^3x^9$ with $ap^3>0$).\n*   By adjusting the constant term of $f$ or $g$ (e.g., replacing $f(x)$ with $f(x)+\\Delta d$), we can shift the graph of $k(x)$ up or down. It is possible to position the graph so that its local maxima are all positive and its local minima are all negative, which would create 9 distinct real roots for $k(x)=0$.\n*   The constraints on the coefficients ($b^2<3ac, q^2<3pr$) are open inequalities. This means there is enough freedom to choose the polynomials. It has been shown in mathematical literature that such polynomials can indeed be constructed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe degree of the fixed-point equation $f(g(x))=x$ is 9, so there can be at most 9 fixed points. The conditions on the derivatives do not reduce this theoretical maximum. It is possible to construct two strictly increasing cubic polynomials $f$ and $g$ such that their composition $f(g(x))$ has 9 fixed points.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
