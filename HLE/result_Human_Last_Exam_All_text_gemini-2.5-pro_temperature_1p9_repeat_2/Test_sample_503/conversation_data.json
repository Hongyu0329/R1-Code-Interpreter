    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), that satisfy the adjunction condition. In the context of posets, this condition can be formulated in several equivalent ways.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Category and Adjunctions:**\n    *   The simplex category $\\Delta$ has objects $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ for $k \\ge 0$. These are totally ordered sets.\n    *   Morphisms are order-preserving maps, i.e., $f: [m] \\to [n]$ such that if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n    *   Viewing $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category means that for any two maps $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f \\le g$ pointwise, i.e., $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n    *   An internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of two morphisms $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ and two 2-morphisms (called the unit and counit), $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$.\n    *   Translating this into the pointwise order, the conditions for an adjunction are:\n        a.  $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is order-preserving.\n        b.  $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is order-preserving.\n        c.  $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$, which means $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n        d.  $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, which means $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n    *   These conditions are equivalent to the more standard definition of a Galois connection between posets: $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$.\n\n2.  **Characterizing Adjoint Maps:**\n    An adjunction is uniquely determined by its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of possible left adjoint maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$.\n    *   A map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if for every element $j \\in [n]$, the set $S_j = \\{i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$ has a maximum element.\n    *   Since $[m]$ is a finite set, any non-empty subset of $[m]$ has a maximum. The condition thus simplifies to requiring that $S_j$ is non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$.\n    *   For $S_j$ to be non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$, it must be non-empty for the smallest element of $[n]$, which is $0$. So, the set $S_0 = \\{i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\le 0\\}$ must be non-empty. This requires that there is some $i \\in [m]$ for which $L(i) \\le 0$. Since $0$ is the minimum element of the codomain $[n]$, this is equivalent to $L(i)=0$.\n    *   Since $L$ must be order-preserving, if $L(i)=0$ for some $i$, then $L(0) \\le L(i)=0$, which implies $L(0)=0$.\n    *   Conversely, if $L(0)=0$, then for any $j \\in [n]$, we have $L(0)=0 \\le j$. Thus $0 \\in S_j$, which means $S_j$ is always non-empty.\n    *   **Conclusion:** An order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $L(0)=0$.\n\n3.  **Counting the Maps:**\n    We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy the condition $L(0)=0$.\n    *   Here, $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n    *   An order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$, where each $L(i)$ is in $[37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n    *   The condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value.\n    *   We are left with determining the values $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ subject to the condition $0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n    *   This is a classic combinatorial problem: choosing a non-decreasing sequence of 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. The size of this set is $37+1=38$.\n    *   This is equivalent to choosing 23 items from 38 categories with replacement, which can be calculated using the stars-and-bars formula for combinations with repetition: $\\binom{k+r-1}{r}$, where $r$ is the number of items to choose and $k$ is the number of categories.\n    *   In our case, $r=23$ (the number of values we need to choose, for $L(1)$ through $L(23)$) and $k=38$ (the number of possible values, from $0$ to $37$).\n    *   The number of such maps is:\n        $$ \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n4.  **Verification (Dual Argument):**\n    We could also count the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$. A map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $R(n)=m$.\n    *   $m=23, n=37$. We need to count order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ with $R(37)=23$.\n    *   This means we choose values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ such that $R(0) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$. The values must be chosen from $[23]=\\{0, ..., 23\\}$, which has $24$ elements.\n    *   We are choosing $r=37$ values from $k=24$ categories.\n    *   The number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n    *   Since $\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!} = \\frac{60!}{37!23!} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both methods yield the same result.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial(60, 23)>>>"
