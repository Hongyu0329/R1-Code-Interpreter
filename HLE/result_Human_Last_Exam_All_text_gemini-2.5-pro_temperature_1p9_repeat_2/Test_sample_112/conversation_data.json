    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Elements:** The question asks for a specific \"book of manners\" that was \"preserved alongside\" the poem \"Sir Launfal\". This implies that both texts are found within the same historical document, most likely a medieval manuscript.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source Manuscript of \"Sir Launfal\":** The poem \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century, survives in a single, important manuscript. Research points to this manuscript being **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, a collection of Middle English works compiled in the 15th century and now held in the British Library.\n\n3.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** Since manuscripts of this era were often anthologies (miscellanies), we need to look at the other texts included in Cotton Caligula A.ii to find the \"book of manners\". This manuscript contains several well-known works, including *Layamon's Brut* and *The Owl and the Nightingale*.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** By reviewing the list of contents for the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript, we can find a text that is explicitly a courtesy book or book of manners. This text is known as **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"**, which translates to \"The Book of Courtesy\". This work is a instructional poem detailing proper conduct, table manners, and etiquette expected in a courtly setting.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The story of \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript, which also contains \"The Boke of Curtasye\". Therefore, this is the book of manners it was preserved alongside.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Specificity of the Manuscript:** The answer hinges on knowing that both texts appear together in a specific historical artifact (Cotton Caligula A.ii). Without this shared context, the question is unanswerable.\n*   **\"Book of Manners\" as a Genre:** Recognizing \"book of manners\" as a specific genre of medieval literature, also called a \"courtesy book,\" is key to identifying the correct text within the manuscript's contents.\n*   **Spelling Variation:** Medieval texts have various spellings. \"The Boke of Curtasye\" is the specific name of the text, but it is functionally \"The Book of Courtesy.\"\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye (The Book of Courtesy)>>>"
