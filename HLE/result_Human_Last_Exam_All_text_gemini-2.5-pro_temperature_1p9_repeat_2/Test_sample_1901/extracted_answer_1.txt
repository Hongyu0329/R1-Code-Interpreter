The proposed design strategy is fundamentally sound, identifying the correct molecular template (a para-substituted benzene ring with a flexible alkyl chain and a polar terminal group) derived from key liquid crystal design principles. However, it contains a critical flaw in its tuning instructions (Point F). To raise a low clearing point, one generally needs to shorten the alkyl chain (within limits), not lengthen it. A more robust approach would be to select a homolog with a clearing point higher than the target temperature (e.g., 1-cyano-4-butylbenzene) and then use a lateral substituent (e.g., fluorine) to systematically lower the clearing point into the desired room-temperature range while simultaneously depressing the melting point.
