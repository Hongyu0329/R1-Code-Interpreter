    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** SNP heritability is a population parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (a trait like height or disease risk) that can be explained by the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in a study (e.g., all common SNPs across the genome). It is the *theoretical maximum* predictive accuracy of a linear model using these SNPs. Think of it as the \"ceiling\" or the total amount of signal available from the SNPs.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS):** A polygenic score is a practical tool we build to predict a phenotype. It is a single number calculated for an individual by summing up their genotypes at many different SNPs, with each SNP's contribution weighted by its estimated effect size. These effect sizes are typically derived from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS).\n\n3.  **Define Predictive Ability of a PGS:** The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how well it correlates with the actual phenotype in an independent sample (one not used to create the score). A common metric is R-squared (R²), which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain.\n\n4.  **Connect the Concepts:**\n    *   The SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the **target**: it's the maximum variance that *could possibly* be explained if we knew the true effects of all SNPs perfectly.\n    *   The PGS is the **attempt to reach the target**: it uses *estimated* effects from a GWAS to try and capture this heritable component.\n\n5.  **Identify Sources of Discrepancy:** The predictive ability of the PGS is almost always lower than the SNP heritability. This gap exists for several key reasons:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The SNP effect sizes used to build the PGS are estimated from a finite number of people. This leads to statistical uncertainty, meaning the estimated effects are not the true effects. This estimation error reduces the accuracy of the resulting PGS.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The statistical methods used to estimate SNP effects have to contend with the complex correlation structure between SNPs (LD), which makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact causal SNP and its true effect size.\n    *   **Winner's Curse:** SNPs that pass a stringent statistical significance threshold in a GWAS are likely to have their effect sizes overestimated. Using these inflated estimates in a PGS reduces its predictive accuracy in new data.\n    *   **Population Differences:** If the PGS is built using a GWAS from one population but applied to another, differences in genetic ancestry, LD patterns, and allele frequencies can reduce its performance.\n\n6.  **Analyze the word \"Necessarily\":** The question asks if the predictive ability is *necessarily* lower.\n    *   By definition, SNP heritability is the *maximum* variance that can be explained by the SNPs in question. Therefore, the variance explained by a PGS constructed from these same SNPs cannot exceed this value. So, R²_PGS ≤ h²_SNP.\n    *   The equality (R²_PGS = h²_SNP) would only be achieved in a hypothetical, impossible scenario where the SNP effect sizes are estimated with perfect accuracy (i.e., with no error). This would require an infinitely large GWAS discovery sample and perfect statistical models.\n    *   Since any real-world PGS is built from a finite sample, it will contain estimation error. This error *necessarily* degrades its predictive power, making it lower than the theoretical maximum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe SNP heritability sets a theoretical upper bound on how much phenotypic variance can be explained by a set of SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical predictor built from *estimated* SNP effects. Due to inevitable estimation errors arising from finite sample sizes and other statistical challenges, the predictive performance of a real-world PGS will fall short of this theoretical ceiling. Therefore, its predictive ability is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
