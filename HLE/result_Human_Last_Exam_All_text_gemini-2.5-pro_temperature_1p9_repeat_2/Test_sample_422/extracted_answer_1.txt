The two problems are:
1.  **Definitional Contradiction**: The model posits Knowledge and Belief as the only two mutually exclusive epistemic states. However, the JTB definition requires that Knowledge is a type of Belief (a justified, true one). This creates a contradiction: to be in the "Knowledge" state, one must also be in a "Belief" state, but the rules of the system forbid being in both states.

2.  **Infinite Regress of Justification**: To justify a belief and turn it into knowledge, one must appeal to other justifying beliefs. For the justification to be valid, these other beliefs must themselves be known. This requirement creates an infinite chain where knowing proposition P1 requires knowing P2, which requires knowing P3, and so on, making it impossible to ever secure the initial justification.
