    "This analysis will break down the question, identify the key constraints, and then deduce the two problems that arise for the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge under these specific conditions.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n*   **Core Theory**: The JTB definition of knowledge is central. Knowledge is defined as a belief that is both justified and true. (K = J + T + B).\n*   **Constraint 1**: The only available epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This simplifies the complex landscape of cognitive states into a strict binary. An individual considering a proposition is either in a state of knowing it or believing it.\n*   **Constraint 2**: \"Ignore Gettier problems\". This is a crucial directive. Gettier problems are classic counterexamples showing that JTB is insufficient for knowledge because one can have a justified true belief by luck. By ignoring them, the question forces us to find more fundamental, structural problems with the JTB model under the given constraints.\n*   **Objective**: Identify two distinct problems that arise from this specific setup.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **The Nature of JTB**: The definition is compositional. \"Knowledge\" isn't a fundamental, atomic state; it's constructed from \"Belief\" plus the properties of \"Justification\" and \"Truth\".\n2.  **Relationship between Knowledge and Belief**: According to JTB, knowledge is a *subset* of belief. If you know something, you necessarily believe it. All instances of knowledge are also instances of belief.\n3.  **The \"Two States\" Constraint**: The premise that Knowledge and Belief are the *only two* states suggests they are distinct and mutually exclusive categories. An individual is either in one state or the other regarding a proposition.\n4.  **The Role of \"Justification\"**: This is the engine that (along with truth) supposedly elevates a mere Belief to Knowledge. How this justification itself is grounded is a key area to investigate for potential problems.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nBased on the points above, we can identify two major problems internal to this framework.\n\n---\n\n#### **Problem 1: The Contradiction of State Definition**\n\nThis problem arises from a direct conflict between the JTB definition and the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the only two available states.\n\n1.  **Premise A (from JTB definition):** Knowledge is a *type* of belief. Specifically, `Knowledge(P)` implies `Belief(P)`. Therefore, the set of things we know is a proper subset of the set of things we believe.\n2.  **Premise B (from the question's constraint):** An epistemic agent can only be in one of two states regarding a proposition P: the \"Knowledge\" state or the \"Belief\" state. This sets them up as mutually exclusive alternatives. If you are in the state of `Knowledge(P)`, you cannot also be in the state of `Belief(P)`.\n3.  **The Contradiction:** These two premises are logically incompatible. Premise A states that being in a state of knowledge requires you to also be in a state of belief. Premise B states that you can only be in one of these states at a time. Therefore, it is impossible to ever be in the state of \"Knowledge,\" because the very act of meeting its definition (which requires belief) would violate the rule that you cannot be in both states. The framework as described is definitionally incoherent.\n\n**Conclusion for Problem 1**: The framework is paradoxical because it defines \"Knowledge\" as a refinement of \"Belief\" while simultaneously positing them as mutually exclusive states.\n\n---\n\n#### **Problem 2: The Infinite Regress of Justification**\n\nThis problem emerges when we try to apply the \"Justification\" condition within the constrained two-state system. This is a classic epistemological problem that JTB, without additional theories like foundationalism, falls prey to.\n\n1.  **The Requirement**: To move from the state of \"Belief\" in proposition P to the state of \"Knowledge\" of P, one needs justification for P.\n2.  **The Nature of Justification**: A justification for P must itself be grounded in other propositions or beliefs (e.g., Q, R, S...). Let's say our justification for P is Q.\n3.  **The Status of the Justifier**: What is our epistemic state regarding the justifying proposition Q? According to the rules, we must either \"Believe\" Q or \"Know\" Q.\n    *   **Case 1: We merely \"Believe\" Q.** Can a mere belief (which, in this system, is by definition not knowledge, and therefore could be unjustified or false) provide adequate justification to turn another belief into knowledge? This is highly implausible. A justification based on a guess or an unsubstantiated belief is not a justification at all. It builds a house of knowledge on a foundation of sand.\n    *   **Case 2: We must \"Know\" Q.** This seems to be the only option for a robust justification. To justify P, we must *know* Q.\n4.  **The Regress**: But to be in the state of \"Knowledge\" of Q, according to JTB, we need a justification for Q. Let's call this new justification R. For R to be a valid justification, we must in turn *know* R. This leads to an inescapable chain:\n    *   To Know P, you need to Know Q.\n    *   To Know Q, you need to Know R.\n    *   To Know R, you need to Know S... and so on, forever.\n5.  **The Impasse**: This creates an infinite regress. Since there is no ultimate, self-justifying \"knowledge\" state defined in the JTB model alone, it becomes impossible to ever complete the process of justification. Consequently, no belief can ever be successfully elevated to knowledge.\n\n**Conclusion for Problem 2**: The justification condition creates an infinite regress because any justifying belief must also be known, requiring its own justification, which in turn must be known, ad infinitum.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<The two problems are:\n1.  **Definitional Contradiction**: The model posits Knowledge and Belief as the only two mutually exclusive epistemic states. However, the JTB definition requires that Knowledge is a type of Belief (a justified, true one). This creates a contradiction: to be in the \"Knowledge\" state, one must also be in a \"Belief\" state, but the rules of the system forbid being in both states.\n\n2.  **Infinite Regress of Justification**: To justify a belief and turn it into knowledge, one must appeal to other justifying beliefs. For the justification to be valid, these other beliefs must themselves be known. This requirement creates an infinite chain where knowing proposition P1 requires knowing P2, which requires knowing P3, and so on, making it impossible to ever secure the initial justification.>>>"
