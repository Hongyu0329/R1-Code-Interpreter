    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n*   **Simple graph:** A graph with no loops and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of vertices V with |V| = 5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures. We don't distinguish between graphs that can be rearranged to look the same.\n*   **2-vertex-connected:** A graph G is 2-vertex-connected if it has at least 3 vertices, is connected, and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph has no cut vertices (articulation points). The vertex connectivity κ(G) is at least 2.\n\n**2. Necessary Conditions for 2-Vertex-Connectivity**\nFor a simple graph G with n vertices to be 2-vertex-connected:\n*   The number of edges, m, must be at least n. For n=5, m >= 5.\n*   The minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2. (If a vertex has degree 1, its only neighbor is a cut vertex, unless the graph is just K2).\n\nFrom the minimum degree condition, we can derive a condition on the number of edges. The sum of degrees is 2m. So, `2m = Σ deg(v) >= n * δ(G)`.\nFor n=5 and δ(G) >= 2, we have `2m >= 5 * 2 = 10`, which means `m >= 5`.\nThis significantly narrows down our search. We only need to consider graphs with 5 to `C(5, 2) = 10` edges.\n\n**3. Enumeration by Number of Edges (m)**\n\n*   **m = 5 edges:**\n    The condition `2m >= n * δ(G)` becomes `10 >= 5 * 2`. For this to hold with δ(G)>=2, every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2. A 2-regular graph on 5 vertices must be the 5-cycle, C5.\n    Is C5 2-vertex-connected? Yes. Removing any vertex leaves a path on 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *Count for m=5: 1*\n\n*   **m = 6 edges:**\n    We need to find all nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges. The possible degree sequences for a graph with min degree 2 are (3,3,2,2,2) and (4,2,2,2,2).\n    - The degree sequence (4,2,2,2,2) corresponds to a unique graph: two triangles sharing a single common vertex (also known as the butterfly graph). The central vertex of degree 4 is a cut vertex; removing it disconnects the two triangles. Thus, this graph is **not** 2-vertex-connected.\n    - The degree sequence (3,3,2,2,2) corresponds to the graph formed by a C5 with a single chord. This graph is known as the \"House Graph\". It is 2-vertex-connected (removing any vertex leaves a connected graph).\n    *Count for m=6: 1*\n\n*   **m = 7 edges:**\n    We analyze the complements, which are graphs with `C(5,2) - 7 = 3` edges. A graph is 2-connected only if it's connected. If a graph `G` is disconnected, its complement `G_bar` is connected. We list the disconnected nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 3 edges:\n    1.  `G1 = P4 U K1` (a path on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex). Its complement `G1_bar` is 2-connected.\n    2.  `G2 = K1,3 U K1` (a star graph on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex). Its complement `G2_bar` has a vertex of degree 1 (the complement of the star's center), so it's **not** 2-connected.\n    3.  `G3 = C3 U 2K1` (a triangle and two isolated vertices). Its complement `G3_bar` is 2-connected.\n    4.  `G4 = P3 U P2` (a path on 3 vertices and a separate edge). Its complement `G4_bar` is 2-connected.\n    The three resulting 2-connected graphs (`G1_bar`, `G3_bar`, `G4_bar`) have different degree sequences, so they are nonisomorphic.\n    *Count for m=7: 3*\n\n*   **m = 8 edges:**\n    We analyze the complements, which are graphs with `10 - 8 = 2` edges. There are two nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 2 edges:\n    1.  `G_A = P2 U P2 U K1` (two disjoint edges and one isolated vertex). Its complement, `K5 - 2K2`, is 3-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n    2.  `G_B = P3 U 2K1` (two edges sharing a vertex, plus two isolated vertices). Its complement, `K5 - P3`, is 2-connected.\n    These two complements have different degree sequences and are thus nonisomorphic.\n    *Count for m=8: 2*\n\n*   **m = 9 edges:**\n    The complement is a graph with `10 - 9 = 1` edge. There is only one such graph `P2 U 3K1`. Its complement is the complete graph minus one edge, `K5 - e`. This graph is 3-connected, and thus 2-connected.\n    *Count for m=9: 1*\n\n*   **m = 10 edges:**\n    The only simple graph with 5 vertices and 10 edges is the complete graph, K5. K5 is 4-vertex-connected, which is greater than 2.\n    *Count for m=10: 1*\n\n**4. Final Tally**\nSumming the counts from each case:\nTotal = (count for m=5) + (count for m=6) + (count for m=7) + (count for m=8) + (count for m=9) + (count for m=10)\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9.\n\nThere are 9 such graphs.\n\n<<<9>>>"
