    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\nThe question asks for the number of **negative fundamental discriminants** that have a **class number** of 48. Let's break down these terms:\n\n*   **Quadratic Field:** A number field of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$, where $d$ is a square-free integer. If $d < 0$, it is an **imaginary quadratic field**.\n*   **Fundamental Discriminant:** The discriminant of a quadratic field. A negative integer $d < 0$ is a fundamental discriminant if either:\n    1.  $d$ is a square-free integer and $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n    2.  $d = 4m$, where $m$ is a square-free integer and $m \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod 4$.\n    Each negative fundamental discriminant corresponds to a unique imaginary quadratic field.\n*   **Class Number:** The class number, denoted $h(d)$, is the order (size) of the ideal class group of the ring of integers of the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$. In simpler terms, it measures how far the ring of integers of the field is from having unique factorization. A class number of 1 means the ring has unique factorization.\n\nThe question is a specific instance of the **Gauss Class Number Problem**, which aims to find all imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number.\n\n**Step 2: Recognizing the Complexity**\n\nFinding the class number for a given discriminant is computationally feasible. However, the inverse problem—finding all discriminants for a given class number—is extremely difficult. There is no simple formula to generate these discriminants.\n\n*   The work of Goldfeld, Gross, and Zagier proved that for any given class number $H$, there is only a finite number of negative fundamental discriminants with that class number. They provided an \"effective\" method to find an upper bound on the absolute value of these discriminants.\n*   However, this theoretical bound is so enormous that a direct search is impossible. The solution requires sophisticated computational algorithms and immense computing power.\n\n**Step 3: Consulting Authoritative Research**\n\nThis problem cannot be solved from first principles or with a simple calculation. The answer must be sourced from the results of specialized research in computational number theory.\n\n*   The definitive work on this problem for class numbers up to 100 was published by **Mark Watkins** in his 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" in the journal *Mathematics of Computation*.\n*   Watkins performed a massive computation, building on previous methods, to find all fundamental discriminants for each class number $H \\in [1, 100]$.\n\n**Step 4: Extracting the Result for Class Number 48**\n\nWatkins's paper provides tables summarizing his results. Table 4 in the paper lists the number of discriminants ($N_H$) found for each class number $H$.\n\n*   For $H = 48$, the paper reports that there are **264** such fundamental discriminants.\n*   This result is corroborated by other standard mathematical resources, such as the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), sequence A006642.\n\n**Step 5: Listing All Careful Points**\n\nIt is crucial to understand the caveats associated with this result.\n\n*   **Point 1: The Result is Conditional.** The completeness of the list of 264 discriminants for class number 48 is **conditional**. It depends on the truth of a standard, but unproven, conjecture in number theory known as the **Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH)**.\n*   **Point 2: The \"Siegel Zero\" Problem.** More precisely, the result is conditional on the non-existence of a specific type of counterexample called a \"Siegel zero\" for a particular Dirichlet L-function. If such a zero existed, it could theoretically give rise to **one** additional, very large fundamental discriminant with a class number of 48.\n*   **Point 3: Status of the Problem.** Proving the result for class number 48 unconditionally (i.e., without relying on the GRH) remains an open problem. Resolving this would require a major breakthrough in analytic number theory.\n*   **Point 4: The Accepted Answer.** Despite being conditional, 264 is the universally accepted number in the mathematics community. The existence of an additional discriminant is considered extremely unlikely. When a question asks \"what is the number,\" the standard practice is to provide this established, albeit conditional, result.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we rely on the most authoritative and complete research available. The work of Mark Watkins provides a complete list of 264 negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48, a result that is complete under the standard assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. No other such discriminants are known to exist, and this is the established answer in the field.\n\n<<<264>>>"
