    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Work:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action:** A character visits a Roman city.\n    *   **Description:** This character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Specific Allusion:** The description must refer to the legend of Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, who were famously suckled by a she-wolf. The question asks who gives this description.\n\n2.  **Character Assessment:**\n    *   The plot of *The House of the Wolfings* revolves around the conflict between the Germanic Wolfing tribe and the invading Roman army.\n    *   Most characters within the tribe have limited firsthand knowledge of Roman cities or culture.\n    *   We need to look for a character who is depicted as having traveled or having special knowledge of the Romans.\n    *   The character known as \"The Fox\" (or \"Fox the Red\") fits this profile. He is portrayed as cunning, worldly, and has had prior contact with the Romans. He acts as a source of information about them, though his loyalty is suspect.\n\n3.  **Locating the Specific Passage:**\n    *   In Chapter IV, \"The House is Roused from Sleep,\" the tribesmen gather to discuss the threat of the Roman invasion.\n    *   The Fox addresses the assembly, attempting to discourage them from fighting by describing the overwhelming power and strange culture of the Romans.\n    *   During his speech, he explicitly states that he has been inside Roman cities. This fulfills the first condition of the question.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Description:**\n    *   The Fox describes what he saw in the Roman temples. He says: \"I have been in their cities, and I have seen their temples, and the images of their Gods; and they have a God that is a She-wolf, a lean-ribbed, hungry-looking beast; and she suckles two male children...\"\n    *   This description is a direct and unmistakable reference to the Capitoline Wolf, the iconic statue depicting the she-wolf nursing the infants Romulus and Remus.\n    *   The Fox interprets this image through the lens of his own culture, seeing it as a symbol of the Romans' predatory nature (\"that shall be the masters of the Goths, and of the whole world\").\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the textual evidence, The Fox is the character who visited a Roman city and described their religious iconography in a way that clearly refers to Romulus and Remus.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   It is important not to confuse The Fox with the protagonist, Thiodolf. While Thiodolf is the central figure, it is The Fox who serves as the main conduit of information about Roman society.\n*   The description is filtered through the character's Germanic perspective, referring to the image as \"a God that is a She-wolf,\" which is an interpretation rather than an accurate account of Roman theology, but it precisely describes the famous founding myth.\n*   The question requires identifying the character, not just understanding the allusion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe character who visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices, alluding to Romulus and Remus, is The Fox.\n\n<<<The Fox>>>"
