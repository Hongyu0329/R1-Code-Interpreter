    "To determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball, we need to follow a clear, step-by-step process.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Triple Crown**\nThe Triple Crown in Major League Baseball refers to a rare achievement by a batter who leads their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific offensive categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish between the number of *times* the Triple Crown has been won and the number of unique *players* who have won it. The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which typically refers to the count of unique players. Also, a player only needs to lead their own league, not the entire MLB.\n\n**Step 2: List All Batting Triple Crown Winners in MLB History**\nWe will list every instance of a player winning the Triple Crown, noting their name, team, league, and the year of the achievement. This comprehensive list allows us to count both the total occurrences and the number of unique players.\n\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878, National League)\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887, American Association - *Note: The AA is recognized by MLB as a major league for this era*)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894, National League)\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901, American League)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909, American League)\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912, National League)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, National League)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, American League)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933, National League)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934, American League)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937, National League)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942, American League)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1925, National League) - *His second win.*\n*   **Ted Williams** (1947, American League) - *His second win.*\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956, American League)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966, American League)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, American League)\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, American League)\n\n**Careful Point:** Note that in 1933, two different players won the Triple Crown, one in each league (Jimmie Foxx in the AL and Chuck Klein in the NL).\n\n**Step 3: Count the Unique Players**\nNow we count the number of individual players from the list above. We must be careful not to double-count players who won the award more than once.\n\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Nap Lajoie\n5.  Ty Cobb\n6.  Heinie Zimmerman\n7.  Rogers Hornsby (Won twice, but is one player)\n8.  Jimmie Foxx\n9.  Chuck Klein\n10. Lou Gehrig\n11. Joe Medwick\n12. Ted Williams (Won twice, but is one player)\n13. Mickey Mantle\n14. Frank Robinson\n15. Carl Yastrzemski\n16. Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting these unique individuals, we find there are 16 different players.\n\n**Careful Point:** There is also a Pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA). However, when the term \"Triple Crown\" is used without a qualifier, it universally refers to the batting achievement. Our analysis correctly focuses on the batting Triple Crown.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\nBased on the historical records, there have been 18 batting Triple Crown seasons achieved by a total of 16 unique players in MLB history. The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which means the number of unique players.\n\nThe final count is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
