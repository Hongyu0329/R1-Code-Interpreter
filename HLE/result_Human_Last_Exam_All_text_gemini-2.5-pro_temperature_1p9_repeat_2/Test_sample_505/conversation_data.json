    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the System Configuration\nThe question asks about a quantum error-correcting system built from surface codes. Let's break down the components mentioned:\n*   **\"Two patches of surface code\"**: This implies the system is composed of two physically separate, disconnected areas of surface code. Since they are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n*   **\"with two holes\"**: This specifies a topological feature. A \"hole\" (or defect/puncture) is a region within a patch where stabilizer measurements are intentionally not performed. Creating holes changes the topology of the surface and allows more logical qubits to be encoded. The phrasing implies that we have a total of two holes to distribute between the two patches.\n*   **\"at most\"**: This suggests we should consider all possible configurations of the two holes in the two patches and find the configuration that yields the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Qubit Capacity of a Single Patch\nTo find the total number of logical qubits, we first need to know how many a single patch can encode.\n*   **A simple patch (no holes)**: A standard, rectangular patch of planar surface code is the basic building block. By using specific types of boundaries (often called \"rough\" and \"smooth\" boundaries), a single, simple patch is designed to encode exactly **one logical qubit**.\n*   **The effect of adding holes**: When a hole is created inside a patch, it introduces a new, independent boundary on the surface. This new topology supports an additional, independent logical qubit. For example, a logical Z operator can be a loop of Pauli-Z operators around the hole's boundary, and a logical X operator can be a string of Pauli-X operators connecting the hole's boundary to the patch's outer boundary.\n*   **Formula for a single patch**: Based on the above points, a single patch of surface code with `h` holes can encode `k = 1 + h` logical qubits. The `1` is for the base qubit of the patch itself, and `h` is the number of additional qubits provided by the holes.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate and Solve the Maximization Problem\nNow we can calculate the total number of logical qubits for the entire system and find its maximum value.\n\n*   Let `k_total` be the total number of logical qubits.\n*   Let `k_1` and `k_2` be the number of logical qubits in Patch 1 and Patch 2, respectively.\n*   Let `h_1` and `h_2` be the number of holes in Patch 1 and Patch 2, respectively.\n\nSince the patches are separate, the total number of qubits is:\n`k_total = k_1 + k_2`\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2 (`k = 1 + h`):\n`k_1 = 1 + h_1`\n`k_2 = 1 + h_2`\n\nSo, `k_total = (1 + h_1) + (1 + h_2) = 2 + h_1 + h_2`\n\nThe problem states there are two holes in total, which gives us the constraint:\n`h_1 + h_2 = 2` (where `h_1` and `h_2` must be non-negative integers).\n\nSubstituting the constraint into our equation for the total qubits:\n`k_total = 2 + (h_1 + h_2) = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Maximum\nThe question asks for the maximum (\"at most\"). We need to check if different ways of distributing the holes change the total qubit count. There are two possible ways to distribute the two holes between the two patches:\n\n*   **Case A: Both holes in one patch.**\n    *   Let `h_1 = 2` and `h_2 = 0`.\n    *   Qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = 1 + h_1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    *   Qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = 1 + h_2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.\n    *   Total qubits: `k_total = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n*   **Case B: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   Let `h_1 = 1` and `h_2 = 1`.\n    *   Qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = 1 + h_1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = 1 + h_2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Total qubits: `k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\nIn all possible configurations, the total number of encoded logical qubits is 4. Therefore, the maximum number is 4.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$.\n<<<4>>>"
