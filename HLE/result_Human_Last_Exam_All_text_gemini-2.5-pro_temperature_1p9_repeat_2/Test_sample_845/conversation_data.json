    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value used to compute HRV.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concepts in the Question:**\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability):** This is not a single value but a measure of the *variation* over time in the interval between consecutive heartbeats. A high HRV generally indicates a more resilient and healthy autonomic nervous system.\n    *   **Beat-to-Beat Intervals:** This is the fundamental data required to calculate HRV. It is the measurement of time that elapses from one heartbeat to the very next one.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** This is the technology used for measurement, common in smartwatches and fitness trackers. It uses light to detect blood volume changes, which creates a waveform with a peak for each pulse.\n    *   **\"Value between heartbeats\":** The question asks for the name of this specific time interval measurement.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Measurement Process:**\n    *   The \"gold standard\" for measuring the time between heartbeats is an **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**, which records the electrical activity of the heart. The most distinct feature of an ECG waveform is the QRS complex, with the \"R-peak\" being the highest point. The time measured from one R-peak to the next R-peak is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   A **PPG** sensor, as mentioned in the question, measures the pulse wave in your capillaries. The time interval between the peaks of the PPG waveform is technically called a **Peak-to-Peak (PP) interval** or, more generally, an **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Correct Term (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Proxy Measurement):** The PP interval from a PPG sensor is used as a proxy or an estimate for the RR interval from an ECG. There is a slight delay (called pulse transit time) between the heart's electrical R-peak and the pulse peak at the wrist, but for HRV calculation, the *variability* of these intervals is what matters, and the variability of PP intervals closely matches that of RR intervals.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Common Terminology):** Because the PP interval is used to approximate the gold-standard RR interval, in the field of HRV, the term **RR interval** is very often used to refer to the beat-to-beat intervals, even when they are collected via PPG.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (General vs. Specific):** While \"PP interval\" is technically specific to PPG, and \"RR interval\" is specific to ECG, the term **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** is a general term that correctly describes the time between beats regardless of the sensor. However, **RR interval** is the most widely recognized and foundational term in HRV literature.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The value measured between heartbeats is a time duration. This duration is the core data point for all HRV calculations. Although the data comes from a PPG sensor (yielding PP intervals or IBIs), the most common and standard term used in the context of HRV for this value is the **RR interval**.\n\n***\n\n<<<RR interval"
