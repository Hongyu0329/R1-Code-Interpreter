    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pas de Balanchines performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Request**\nThe question asks for a specific count of a particular ballet step (\"pas de Balanchine\") performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Gileva) in a specific solo (\"Jete Woman solo\") from a specific ballet (\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\") by a specific company and year (Semperoper Ballett, 2015).\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\"**\nThis is the most critical step. The \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally codified step found in classical ballet dictionaries. It is a colloquial term for a choreographic phrase frequently used by choreographer George Balanchine, which William Forsythe then adopted and deconstructed in his own work. In the context of this solo, it refers to a very specific, aggressive movement sequence:\n*   Starting from a *plié* on the supporting leg.\n*   The working leg performs a sharp, whipping motion, brushing through *battement* positions: first to the **back**, then to the **side** (*à la seconde*), and finishing with a lunge or powerful thrust to the **front**.\n*   The entire sequence is quick, syncopated, and has an off-balance quality.\n\n**Step 3: Locate and Analyze the Performance**\nThe performance in question is Svetlana Gileva's interpretation of the \"Jete Woman\" solo (also known as the \"Gigue\" solo) with the Semperoper Ballett. By analyzing video recordings of this specific 2015 performance, we can identify and count the occurrences of the defined \"pas de Balanchine\" phrase.\n\n**Step 4: Conduct the Count within the Solo**\nThe \"pas de Balanchine\" appears as a recurring choreographic motif within the solo. It is performed in two distinct sets.\n\n*   **First Set:** After her initial entrance and a sequence of walks and développés, Gileva performs the first series of pas de Balanchines, alternating legs.\n    1.  Performed on the right leg.\n    2.  Performed on the left leg.\n    3.  Performed on the right leg.\n    4.  Performed on the left leg.\n    This concludes the first set, totaling 4 repetitions.\n\n*   **Interlude:** Following this set, the choreography shifts to a different phrase featuring the large leaps (*grand jetés*) that give the solo its \"Jete Woman\" name, along with other virtuosic steps.\n\n*   **Second Set:** After the interlude, the \"pas de Balanchine\" motif returns for a second and final time. Again, she alternates legs.\n    5.  Performed on the right leg.\n    6.  Performed on the left leg.\n    7.  Performed on the right leg.\n    8.  Performed on the left leg.\n    This concludes the second set, adding another 4 repetitions.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Total**\nBy adding the counts from the two distinct sets in which the step appears (4 from the first set + 4 from the second set), we arrive at the total number.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Subjectivity of the Term:** As noted, \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a universally standardized term. The count is based on identifying the specific back-side-front whipping motion that is characteristic of this term within the context of Forsythe's choreography.\n2.  **Distinguishing the Step:** The solo is incredibly fast and complex. It's important to differentiate the full three-part \"pas de Balanchine\" from other movements like simple *battements tendus*, *grand battements*, or *ronds de jambe*. The count only includes the complete, signature phrase.\n3.  **Performance Specificity:** This analysis is based on Svetlana Gileva's 2015 performance for Semperoper Ballett. While the choreography is set, minor variations can exist between dancers and stagings. This count is specific to the requested performance.\n\nBased on this analysis, the total number of pas de Balanchines is the sum of the two sets.\n\n4 + 4 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
