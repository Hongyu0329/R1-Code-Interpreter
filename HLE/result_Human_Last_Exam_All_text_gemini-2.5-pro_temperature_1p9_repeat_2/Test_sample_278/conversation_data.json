    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve in the first interval.**\nFor the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the value of $b$ is 1. The parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\nWe can see that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin.\nAs $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n*   $x = \\cos t$ varies from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$.\n*   $y = \\sin t$ is always non-negative ($y \\ge 0$). It starts at $\\sin(0)=0$, goes up to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$, and returns to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$.\nSo, this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of a unit circle.\nFor this part, the range of x is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y is $[0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the parametric curve in the second interval.**\nFor the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the value of $b$ is 5. The parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5\\sin t$\nFrom these equations, we have $x = \\cos t$ and $y/5 = \\sin t$. Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-minor axis of length 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of length 5 along the y-axis.\nAs $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n*   $x = \\cos t$ varies from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ up to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$.\n*   $y = 5\\sin t$ is always non-positive ($y \\le 0$). It starts at $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$, goes down to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$, and returns to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$.\nSo, this part of the curve is the lower half of the ellipse $x^2 + y^2/25 = 1$.\nFor this part, the range of x is $(-1, 1)$ and the range of y is $[-5, 0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the overall dimensions of the figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for x and y, which define the bounding box of the figure.\n*   **X-dimension:**\n    *   From Step 1, the x-range is $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   From Step 2, the x-range is $(-1, 1)$.\n    *   The total x-range for the entire figure is the union of these, which is $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   The minimum x-value is $x_{min} = -1$.\n    *   The maximum x-value is $x_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Y-dimension:**\n    *   From Step 1, the y-range is $[0, 1]$.\n    *   From Step 2, the y-range is $[-5, 0)$.\n    *   The total y-range for the entire figure is the union of these, which is $[-5, 1]$.\n    *   The minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n    *   The maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the dimensions of the smallest circumscribing square.**\nThe figure is contained within a bounding rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can contain this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n*   Side length of the square, $S = \\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the square.**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n*   Area = $S^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
