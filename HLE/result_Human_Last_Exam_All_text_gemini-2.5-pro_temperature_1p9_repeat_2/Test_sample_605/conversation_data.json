    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Verifying the Inputs\n\nThe problem asks for the Crawley-Nordström invariant of a Calabi-Yau Link. This is described by a polynomial equation within an ambient weighted projective space.\n\n*   **Equation:** $F = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$\n*   **Ambient Space:** Weighted projective space with 5 coordinates $(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$.\n*   **Weights:** $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\nFor a polynomial to define a hypersurface in a weighted projective space, it must be quasi-homogeneous. This means that every monomial in the polynomial must have the same weighted degree. The weighted degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}z_3^{a_3}z_4^{a_4}z_5^{a_5}$ is given by $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i w_i$.\n\nLet's calculate the degree of each monomial in the given polynomial $F$:\n*   $z_1^8z_3$: $8 \\cdot 22 + 1 \\cdot 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n*   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: $4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 1 \\cdot 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$\n*   $z_1z_2^7$: $1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$\n*   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $1 \\cdot 22 + 1 \\cdot 29 + 1 \\cdot 49 + 1 \\cdot 50 + 1 \\cdot 75 = 225$\n*   $z_2z_3^4$: $1 \\cdot 29 + 4 \\cdot 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$\n*   $z_4^3z_5$: $3 \\cdot 50 + 1 \\cdot 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$\n*   $z_5^3$: $3 \\cdot 75 = 225$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The polynomial is not quasi-homogeneous. The term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a weighted degree of 224, while all other terms have a weighted degree of 225. A non-homogeneous polynomial does not define a variety in a weighted projective space. This strongly suggests a typographical error in the problem statement.\n\nFor a Calabi-Yau threefold given as a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, ..., w_5)$, the Calabi-Yau condition requires the degree $d$ to be equal to the sum of the weights, $d = \\sum w_i$.\nLet's check the sum of weights: $22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\nThis matches the degree of most terms. It is overwhelmingly likely that the intended polynomial is quasi-homogeneous of degree $d=225$.\n\n**Action:** We will proceed by assuming the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ is a mistake and should be omitted from the polynomial. The corrected polynomial is:\n$F' = z_1^8z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3$\n\n### Step 2: The Formula for the Crawley-Nordström Invariant\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for the link of an isolated quasi-homogeneous singularity $F=0$ can be computed combinatorially from its Newton polyhedron $\\Gamma(F)$. The formula is:\n$c_N(L(F)) = |\\text{Vert}_{in}(\\Gamma)| - |J|$\nwhere:\n*   $\\Gamma(F)$ is the Newton polyhedron, which is the convex hull of the exponent vectors of the monomials in $F$.\n*   $\\text{Vert}_{in}(\\Gamma)$ is the set of vertices of $\\Gamma$ that are \"inner\", meaning they do not lie on any coordinate axis. An exponent vector is on a coordinate axis if only one of its components is non-zero.\n*   $J$ is the set of indices $j$ such that the polynomial $F$ is independent of the variable $z_j$. $|J|$ is the number of such variables.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Vertices of the Newton Polyhedron\n\nFirst, we list the exponent vectors for each monomial in our corrected polynomial $F'$:\n*   $m_1 = z_1^8z_3 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad v_1 = (8, 0, 1, 0, 0)$\n*   $m_2 = z_1z_2^7 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad v_2 = (1, 7, 0, 0, 0)$\n*   $m_3 = z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad v_3 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$\n*   $m_4 = z_2z_3^4 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad v_4 = (0, 1, 4, 0, 0)$\n*   $m_5 = z_4^3z_5 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad v_5 = (0, 0, 0, 3, 1)$\n*   $m_6 = z_5^3 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad v_6 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 3)$\n\nNext, we identify which of these six vectors are vertices of their convex hull. A vector is a vertex if it cannot be written as a convex combination of the others.\n*   $v_1, v_2, v_4, v_5, v_6$ are all vertices. We can see this as each of these vectors maximizes a coordinate function over the set of vectors (e.g., $v_1$ has the maximum first coordinate, $v_2$ has the maximum second coordinate, etc.).\n*   Let's check $v_3 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$. We test if it can be written as a convex combination of the other five vertices. Indeed, we can find coefficients such that $v_3 = \\frac{1}{9}v_1 + \\frac{1}{9}v_2 + \\frac{2}{9}v_4 + \\frac{3}{9}v_5 + \\frac{2}{9}v_6$. Since the coefficients are all positive and sum to 1, $v_3$ lies in the interior of the convex hull of the other points and is therefore not a vertex.\n\nSo, the set of vertices is $\\text{Vert}(\\Gamma) = \\{v_1, v_2, v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$. There are 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Inner Vertices\n\nNow we must determine which of these 5 vertices are \"inner\". A vertex is inner if its exponent vector has more than one non-zero component.\n*   $v_1 = (8, 0, 1, 0, 0)$: Two non-zero components. It is **inner**.\n*   $v_2 = (1, 7, 0, 0, 0)$: Two non-zero components. It is **inner**.\n*   $v_4 = (0, 1, 4, 0, 0)$: Two non-zero components. It is **inner**.\n*   $v_5 = (0, 0, 0, 3, 1)$: Two non-zero components. It is **inner**.\n*   $v_6 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 3)$: Only one non-zero component. It is **not inner** (it lies on the $z_5$ axis).\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Distinguishing between vertices and inner vertices is crucial. A vertex corresponding to a pure power monomial (e.g., $z_i^k$) is not an inner vertex.\nThe number of inner vertices is $|\\text{Vert}_{in}(\\Gamma)| = 4$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nWe apply the formula $c_N = |\\text{Vert}_{in}(\\Gamma)| - |J|$.\n*   We found $|\\text{Vert}_{in}(\\Gamma)| = 4$.\n*   We need to find $|J|$, the number of variables not present in $F'$. The polynomial $F'$ is $z_1^8z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3$. It contains all five variables $z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5$. Therefore, the set $J$ is empty, and $|J| = 0$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$c_N = 4 - 0 = 4$\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is 4.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  Corrected the ill-defined problem by assuming the non-homogeneous term in the polynomial was a typo and removing it.\n2.  Identified the 6 exponent vectors of the monomials in the corrected polynomial.\n3.  Determined that 5 of these vectors are vertices of the Newton polyhedron.\n4.  Counted that 4 of these 5 vertices are \"inner\" (not on a coordinate axis).\n5.  Observed that the polynomial depends on all variables, so $|J|=0$.\n6.  Calculated the invariant as the number of inner vertices minus $|J|$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
