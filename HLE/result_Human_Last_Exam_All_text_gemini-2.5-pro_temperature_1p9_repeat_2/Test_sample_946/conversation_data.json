    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user wants to identify the name of a fictional singer. The key details are:\n    *   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n    *   **Episode:** Specifically, \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n    *   **Event:** The Junior prom.\n    *   **Performer:** A cardboard cutout.\n\n2.  **Locate the Scene:** First, we must recall or find the plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". This episode, also known as \"4 Gregs\", centers on the four main girls getting ready for and attending their Junior Prom.\n\n3.  **Identify the Musical Performance:** At the prom, the \"live entertainment\" is a central gag. Instead of a real band or DJ, there is a stage with a boombox playing music next to a life-sized cardboard cutout of a pop star.\n\n4.  **Identify the Singer's Name:** When the girls arrive at the prom, Cheerleader points to the stage and provides the name of the singer in her dialogue. She exclaims, \"Look! It's a cardboard cutout of Kaskar! He's our favorite!\"\n\n5.  **Confirm the Name:** The dialogue from other characters further confirms this. What's Her Face then chimes in, \"Oh, I have all of Kaskar's CDs. They're all scratched.\" This conversation solidifies the name of the fictional singer as Kaskar.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **It's a cardboard cutout, not a person:** The question is specific about this detail, which is crucial to the joke in the cartoon.\n*   **The name is stated explicitly:** The name \"Kaskar\" is not just implied but spoken aloud by the characters, making it the definitive answer.\n*   **Distinguish from other fictional musicians:** The Homestar Runner universe has many fictional bands and musicians (e.g., Limozeen, Taranchula, Sloshy). It's important to focus only on the one featured in this specific scene.\n*   **Episode specificity:** The answer must come from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" and no other episode.\n\nBy following these steps and paying attention to the details, we can confidently identify the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Kaskar>>>"
