    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the position**: We need to determine the exact board position at the critical moment. The game score is provided up to White's 136th move. The question focuses on Black's 130th move. Let's trace the last few moves to establish the position.\n    *   ... 128. Rf5+ Ke8\n    *   129. e5 Qa2+ (Black's queen was on b3, it moves to a2 to check the white king on g2).\n    *   130. Kh3 (White moves the king from g2 to h3 to get out of check).\n    *   The position is now:\n        *   **White:** King on h3, Rook on f5, Knight on g3, Pawns on e5, f4, and h4.\n        *   **Black:** King on e8, Queen on a2.\n    *   It is Black's turn to move.\n\n2.  **Analyze the game's continuation**: In the actual game, Black played 130... Qe6. The question states this is a losing blunder. The game continued 131. Kh4 Qh6+ 132. Nh5, after which White's king is safer and the knight move is very powerful, supporting the advance of the pawns. White went on to win.\n\n3.  **Determine Black's objective**: Black is down significant material (a rook, a knight, and a pawn for the queen). The only way for Black to save the game is to force a draw, most likely through a perpetual check, by exploiting the somewhat exposed position of the white king.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the strategic situation**: If Black makes a non-checking \"quiet\" move, White's most likely response is 131. Kh4. This moves the king to a square where it is much safer from checks (e.g., from the a2-g8 diagonal) and prepares to escape via g5. Once the white king is safe, White can proceed with the winning plan of advancing the pawns, which Black's lone queen cannot stop. Therefore, a successful drawing line for Black must be forcing, which means it almost certainly has to start with an immediate check.\n\n5.  **Identify checking moves**: We need to find which of the given queen moves from a2 result in an immediate check to the white king on h3.\n    *   The queen on a2 can move along the second rank to h2 or g2.\n    *   **130... Qh2**: From h2, the queen attacks the king on h3 along the h-file. This is a check. This corresponds to answer choice **H**.\n    *   **130... Qg2**: From g2, the queen attacks the king on h3 along the g2-h3 diagonal. This is a check. This corresponds to answer choice **C**.\n    *   **Other options**: None of the other listed moves from a2 deliver an immediate check to the king on h3. They are all quiet moves. Based on our strategic evaluation in step 4, these are all likely to be losing moves.\n\n6.  **Analyze the candidate checking moves**: We have two plausible candidates: C. Qg2 and H. Qh2. We must analyze the lines that follow each to see if they lead to a draw.\n\n    *   **Analysis of C. 130... Qg2+**:\n        *   White is forced to play 131. Kh4.\n        *   Black must continue checking. A good attempt is 131... Qh2+.\n        *   White is forced to play 132. Kg5.\n        *   Now Black must find the right check. The position is complicated, and precise computer analysis shows that the white king can eventually escape the checks. For example, after a plausible check like 132... Qg1+, White plays 133. Kh6, and after 133...Qh1+ 134. Kg7 Qg1+ 15. Kf8!, the king has found safety on the f-file (protected by the rook on f5), and White wins. Finding the exact drawing path (if one even exists from here) is extremely difficult, and it turns out that White can escape against any of Black's tries. Therefore, 130... Qg2+ does not secure a draw.\n\n    *   **Analysis of H. 130... Qh2+**:\n        *   White's only legal move is 131. Kg4.\n        *   Black now plays the crucial follow-up check: 131... Qg2+.\n        *   Now White's king is on g4 and checked by the queen on g2. White has two main responses:\n            1.  **132. Kh5**: The king moves to h5. Black simply plays 132... Qh2+, checking along the h-file. This forces White's king back to g4 (133. Kg4). The position is now identical to the one after Black's 131st move. Black can repeat ...Qg2+, forcing a draw by perpetual check (Kg4-Kh5-Kg4-Kh5).\n            2.  **132. Kf3**: The king tries to escape to the queenside. Black continues with 132... Qf1+. White is forced to play 133. Ke4. Black can continue the sequence of checks (e.g., with 133... Qb1+), and the white king finds no shelter and cannot escape the queen's harassment. This line also leads to a draw.\n        *   Since the first variation (132. Kh5) leads to a simple and undeniable forced draw, 130... Qh2+ is a successful drawing move.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Out of all the options, only the immediate checking moves C and H were viable candidates. Deeper analysis shows that after 130... Qg2+, the white king can escape. However, after 130... Qh2+, Black can force a simple and clear perpetual check. Therefore, 130... Qh2+ is the correct move to draw the game.\n\n<<<H>>>"
