    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core elements of the question are:\n*   **Subject:** Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian (late 19th-early 20th century).\n*   **Action:** He \"frequently accused\" and \"denounced\" something.\n*   **Object of denunciation:** \"X-Ys\", which is linked to the \"Western culture of his time\".\n*   **Metaphor used:** The object was called a \"stagnant swamp\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Figure and Context**\nPavel Milyukov was a leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in Russia. As a historian and a politician, he was a firm believer in rationalism, progress, and the ideals of the Western European Enlightenment. He valued clarity, reason, and social utility in culture and art. This intellectual background would naturally put him at odds with artistic movements that emphasized subjectivity, irrationalism, mysticism, and aestheticism for its own sake.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Opposing Cultural Movement**\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries, Milyukov's active period, saw the rise of Modernism in Europe. This broad movement encompassed several trends that rejected the 19th-century traditions of Realism and Positivism. Key sub-movements that spread from Western Europe (especially France) to Russia included:\n*   **Symbolism:** Focused on the mystical, the spiritual, and suggestion over direct description.\n*   **Decadence:** Characterized by a fascination with artifice, morbidity, perversity, and a sense of civilizational decline. The artists and writers of this movement were known as **the Decadents**.\n\nThese movements were the primary targets of rationalist critics like Milyukov.\n\n**Step 4: Connect Milyukov's Criticism to a Specific Group**\nHistorical records and scholarly articles on Russian culture of the \"Silver Age\" frequently mention Milyukov's staunch opposition to the \"new art\". He famously delivered speeches and wrote articles attacking what he saw as its unhealthy and unproductive nature. The \"stagnant swamp\" metaphor is one of his most well-known criticisms. He specifically aimed this critique at the artists and writers who embraced themes of decay, irrationality, and anti-social individualism.\n\n**Step 5: Identify \"X-Ys\"**\nThe group that Milyukov targeted with this rhetoric was precisely **the Decadents**.\n*   The term \"Decadents\" refers to the practitioners of the Decadent movement.\n*   The \"Ys\" ending in the placeholder \"X-Ys\" strongly suggests a plural noun for a group of people. \"Decadents\" fits this perfectly.\n*   Milyukov saw the Decadent movement, with its roots in French authors like Baudelaire and Huysmans, as a corrupting Western influence that was leading Russian culture into a morbid, stagnant swamp, away from the path of rational progress.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the historical context, Pavel Milyukov's intellectual position, and the specific metaphor used, \"X-Ys\" stands for **the Decadents**.\n\n<<<the Decadents>>>"
