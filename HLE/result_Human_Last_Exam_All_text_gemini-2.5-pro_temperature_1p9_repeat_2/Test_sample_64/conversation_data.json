    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Word and its Reading**\nThe kanji is 「弟」.\nThe standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Morae**\nWe need to count the morae (the basic units of sound duration in Japanese) in 「おとうと」.\n- お (o) - 1st mora\n- と (to) - 2nd mora\n- う (u) - 3rd mora (this 'u' lengthens the 'o' vowel of the previous mora, but is counted as its own mora for pitch accent purposes)\n- と (to) - 4th mora\nTherefore, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Pitch Accent Patterns**\nLet's briefly define the pitch accent patterns given in the answer choices in the context of a four-mora word like 「おとうと」. Let's use 「が」 (ga) as a following particle to show the complete pattern.\n\n*   **A. Heiban (平板, [0] pattern):** The pitch starts low on the first mora and rises on the second. It then stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles.\n    *   Pattern: おとうとが (o-TO-U-TO-GA) -> Low-High-High-High-High\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高, [1] pattern):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second, staying low for the rest of the word and any following particles.\n    *   Pattern: おとうとが (O-to-u-to-ga) -> High-Low-Low-Low-Low\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高, [2] or [3] pattern):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word.\n    *   [2] Pattern: おとうとが (o-TO-u-to-ga) -> Low-High-Low-Low-Low (The peak is on the 2nd mora).\n    *   [3] Pattern: おとうとが (o-TO-U-to-ga) -> Low-High-High-Low-Low (The peak is on the 3rd mora).\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高, [4] pattern for a 4-mora word):** The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high until the last mora of the word, then drops on the following particle.\n    *   Pattern: おとうとが (o-TO-U-TO-ga) -> Low-High-High-High-Low\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Standard Pitch Accent for 「弟」 (おとうと)**\nAccording to standard Japanese dictionaries, including the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary (NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典), the pitch accent for 「弟」 (おとうと) is the [0] pattern.\n\nThis means:\n1.  The first mora 「お」 is low.\n2.  The pitch rises on the second mora 「と」 and stays high for the remaining morae 「う」 and 「と」.\n3.  A particle following the word, like 「が」, also remains high.\n\nThe pitch contour is: おとうとが (Low-High-High-High-High).\n\n**Step 5: Match the Pattern to the Answer Choices**\nThe observed pattern (Low-High-High-High...) is the defining characteristic of the **Heiban (平板)** type.\n\n*   It is not Atamadaka because the first mora is low, not high.\n*   It is not Nakadaka because the pitch does not fall within the word.\n*   It is not Odaka because the pitch of a following particle remains high, it does not drop.\n\nTherefore, the correct pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
