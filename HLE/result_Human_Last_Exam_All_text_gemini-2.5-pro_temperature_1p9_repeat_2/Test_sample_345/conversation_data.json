    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the museum that acquired Kurt Günther's \"The Radionist\" in 1967.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key information in the question:**\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\"\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year of Acquisition:** 1967\n    *   **Goal:** Find the name of the acquiring museum.\n\n2.  **Research the artwork:** A search for \"Kurt Günther The Radionist 1927\" or the original German title \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist 1927\" will point to its current location.\n\n3.  **Locate the current holding institution:** The painting is a well-known work of the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement in Germany. Research shows that it is held by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums) in Germany.\n\n4.  **Specify the exact museum within the Berlin State Museums:** The painting is part of the collection of the **Neue Nationalgalerie** (New National Gallery), which is the museum for art of the 20th century within the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\n\n5.  **Verify the acquisition date:** To confirm the year of acquisition, we need to check the museum's own records or reliable art databases. The online collection database for the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin provides provenance information for its holdings. The entry for Kurt Günther's \"Der Radionist\" carries the inventory number **NG 11/67**. The \"NG\" stands for Nationalgalerie, and the \"67\" indicates the year of acquisition, 1967. The provenance details explicitly state \"1967 erworben\", which translates to \"acquired in 1967\".\n\n6.  **Synthesize the final answer:** Based on the museum's official records, the Nationalgalerie in Berlin (today's Neue Nationalgalerie, part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin) acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in the year 1967.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **German Title:** Using the original German title \"Der Radionist\" can yield more precise search results.\n*   **Museum Network:** The \"Staatliche Museen zu Berlin\" is a large network of museums. It is important to identify the specific museum within this network, which is the Neue Nationalgalerie. At the time of acquisition in 1967, it was known as the Nationalgalerie (of West Berlin).\n*   **Inventory Number:** The inventory number (NG 11/67) is a strong piece of evidence, as museum cataloging systems often incorporate the year of acquisition.\n*   **Provenance:** Checking the provenance (history of ownership) is the most reliable way to confirm the acquisition details.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe painting was acquired by the Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (the collection is now housed in the Neue Nationalgalerie).\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums)>>>"
