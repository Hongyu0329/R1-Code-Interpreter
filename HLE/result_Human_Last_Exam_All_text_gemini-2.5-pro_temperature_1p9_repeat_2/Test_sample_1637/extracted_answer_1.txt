Yes, modifying the molecule to include a longer PEG (polyethylene glycol) chain is a very effective and commonly used strategy to increase the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic probes and is highly likely to solve the precipitation problem. The root cause of the precipitation is the dominant hydrophobic character of the large thioxanthenone ring system and the six-carbon alkyl chain. The current short polar linkers are insufficient to keep the molecule dissolved at a high concentration of 100 ÂµM. Incorporating a longer PEG chain (by extending the existing short spacer) would significantly increase the overall hydrophilicity of the molecule, preventing the hydrophobic regions from aggregating and precipitating out of the aqueous cell culture medium.
