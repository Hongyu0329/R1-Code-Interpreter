One must be careful not to confuse Tommaso's journey with Piero's.\n2.  **Plot Context:** Tommaso's move is a significant event in the movie. It represents a divergence in the life paths of the two friends—Piero remains in their working-class neighborhood in Livorno, while the wealthier Tommaso pursues opportunities abroad.\n3.  **Location Specificity:** The question asks for a specific US city, not just the country. The film provides this detail explicitly.\n4.  **Source Verification:** Information should be drawn from reliable plot summaries or analyses of the film to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the film and character:** The film is the 1997 Italian movie *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg).
