    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Define the Sequence\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), X(k) and H(k), for two 4-point sequences, x(n) and h(n).\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe need to find the 4-point DFT of a new sequence formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`. Let's call this new sequence `y_long(m)`.\n*   `y_long(m) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nThis is an 8-point sequence. The question asks for its 4-point DFT.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret \"4-point DFT of an 8-point Sequence\"\n\nWhen the DFT length (N=4) is shorter than the sequence length (L=8), the standard interpretation is to perform time-domain aliasing (or \"folding\") on the sequence before taking the DFT.\nWe create a 4-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, by wrapping the 8-point sequence `y_long(m)` and summing the values:\n`y(n) = y_long(n) + y_long(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nA key property of the DFT connects this time-domain aliasing to frequency-domain sampling. The 4-point DFT of the aliased sequence `y(n)`, let's call it `Y_4(k)`, is equivalent to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original 8-point sequence `y_long(m)`, let's call it `Y_8(k)`.\n*   **Property:** `Y_4(k) = DFT{y(n)} = Y_8(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   **Goal:** Our task is to find the sequence `Y_4 = {Y_8(0), Y_8(2), Y_8(4), Y_8(6)}`.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the 8-point DFT `Y_8(k)` to the Given DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`\n\nThe 8-point sequence `y_long(m)` is constructed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`. This means `x(n)` represents the even-indexed samples of `y_long(m)`, and `h(n)` represents the odd-indexed samples.\n*   `y_long(2n) = x(n)`\n*   `y_long(2n+1) = h(n)`\n\nThis is the standard structure for the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y_8(k)` can be computed from the 4-point DFTs of its even (`x`) and odd (`h`) parts using the following formulas:\n*   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`: `Y_8(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n*   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`: `Y_8(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n\nwhere `W_N = e^(-j2π/N)` is the twiddle factor.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculations\n\nWe need to compute `Y_8(0)`, `Y_8(2)`, `Y_8(4)`, and `Y_8(6)`. This means we only need the values of `X(k)` and `H(k)` at `k=0` and `k=2`, and the twiddle factors `W_8^0` and `W_8^2`.\n\n**Needed values:**\n*   From `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`: `X(0) = 1`, `X(2) = -1`.\n*   From `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`: `H(0) = 0`, `H(2) = 1`.\n*   Twiddle Factors:\n    *   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^(-j2π*2/8) = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Find `Y_4(0) = Y_8(0)`:**\n    Use the formula `Y_8(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=0`.\n    `Y_8(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1) * (0) = 1`\n\n2.  **Find `Y_4(1) = Y_8(2)`:**\n    Use the formula `Y_8(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=2`.\n    `Y_8(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * (1) = -1 - j`\n\n3.  **Find `Y_4(2) = Y_8(4)`:**\n    Use the formula `Y_8(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=0`.\n    `Y_8(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1) * (0) = 1`\n\n4.  **Find `Y_4(3) = Y_8(6)`:**\n    Use the formula `Y_8(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=2`.\n    `Y_8(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * (1) = -1 + j`\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nCombining the results, the 4-point DFT for the sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}` is:\n`Y_4(k) = {Y_4(0), Y_4(1), Y_4(2), Y_4(3)} = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
