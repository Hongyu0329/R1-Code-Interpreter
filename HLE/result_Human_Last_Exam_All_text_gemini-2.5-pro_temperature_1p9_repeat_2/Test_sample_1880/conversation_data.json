    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n\n*   **Polynomial:** $P(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\n*   **Prime:** Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n*   **Conditions for Eisenstein's Criterion:**\n    1.  $p$ does not divide the leading coefficient ($a_4 = 1$). This is true, as $2 \\nmid 1$.\n    2.  $p$ divides all other coefficients ($a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$). This is true, as $2|0$, $2|0$, $2|8$, and $2|14$.\n    3.  $p^2$ does not divide the constant term ($a_0 = 14$). This is true, as $p^2 = 4$ and $4 \\nmid 14$.\n\nSince all conditions are met, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Careful point:** Always verify irreducibility first. If a polynomial is reducible, its Galois group is smaller and computed differently.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Possible Galois Groups\nSince $P(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 4, its Galois group, let's call it $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are:\n*   $S_4$ (order 24)\n*   $A_4$ (the alternating group, order 12)\n*   $D_4$ (the dihedral group, order 8)\n*   $V_4$ (the Klein four-group, order 4)\n*   $C_4$ (the cyclic group, order 4)\n\nOur goal is to determine which of these groups is the Galois group of $P(x)$ and then find its order.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Discriminant\nThe discriminant helps narrow down the possibilities. The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\n\n*   **Formula:** For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\n*   **Our polynomial:** $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, so $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3$\n    $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n    $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n    $\\Delta = 591872$\n*   **Check if $\\Delta$ is a square:** We can factor $\\Delta$ to check.\n    $\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096) = 2^8(2^3 \\cdot 7^3) - 27(2^{12}) = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11}(7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2) = 2^{11}(343 - 54) = 2^{11}(289) = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\n    The square root of $\\Delta$ is $\\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 17 \\cdot 2^5 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G$ is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$. The possible groups are now $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n*   **Careful point:** The discriminant calculation involves large numbers and is prone to error. Factoring the terms before multiplication, as shown above, can simplify the process and reduce the chance of mistakes.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nTo distinguish between the remaining possibilities ($S_4$, $D_4$, $C_4$), we construct and analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial.\n\n*   **Formula:** For a polynomial $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\n*   **Our polynomial:** $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n*   **Construction:**\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n*   **Check for Reducibility:** The Galois group is a subgroup of $D_4$ (i.e., $D_4$ or $C_4$) if and only if the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means it must have at least one rational root. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$.\n    Let's test $y=8$:\n    $R(8) = (8)^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$, as the group for $S_4$ requires an irreducible resolvent. The possible groups are now $D_4$ or $C_4$. Both have an order of 8 or 4.\n\n*   **Careful point:** A common mistake is to stop here and assume the group is $D_4$. We must distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n### Step 5: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nA further test is needed. When the resolvent cubic for $x^4+qx+r$ has a rational root $\\alpha$, the Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if the quantity $\\alpha^2 - 4r$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Rational root of resolvent:** $\\alpha = 8$.\n*   **Constant term of quartic:** $r = 14$.\n*   **Test:** We check if $\\alpha^2 - 4r$ is a square.\n    $\\alpha^2 - 4r = (8)^2 - 4(14) = 64 - 56 = 8$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The number 8 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, the Galois group is not $C_4$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only remaining possibility for the Galois group is $D_4$. The order of the dihedral group $D_4$ is 8.\n\nThe order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is **8**.\n\n<<<8>>>"
