    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the fields and determine the degree of the extension.**\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and it is well-known that $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$ and $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$, so $L = K(\\alpha)$.\nLet's consider $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Note that $\\beta \\in K$.\nThe degree of the extension $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\alpha \\in K$, and 2 if $\\alpha \\notin K$.\nTo check if $\\alpha \\in K$, we need to determine if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$.\n\n**Step 2: Check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$.**\nA powerful method is to use norms. If $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in K$, then its norm with respect to any sub-extension must be a square in the corresponding subfield.\nLet's compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ down to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is generated by the automorphism $\\sigma: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta)$\n$\\sigma(\\beta) = \\sigma((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, then $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $6$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's assume $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for some $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$6 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $a,b$ are rational, this implies $2ab\\sqrt{2} = 0$, so either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nIf $a=0$, then $6=2b^2 \\implies b^2=3$, so $b = \\pm\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $b=0$, then $6=a^2 \\implies a = \\pm\\sqrt{6} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis proves that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, so $\\alpha \\notin K$.\nTherefore, $[L:K] = 2$ and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$.**\nThe field $L$ contains $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha$. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. A short calculation shows that all these conjugates are in $L$, making $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ a Galois extension.\nThe group $G$ is of order 8. We have a tower of Galois extensions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$.\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$. Let the generator be $\\tau$, where $\\tau(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$.\nWe have a short exact sequence: $1 \\to H \\to G \\to \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to 1$.\nThis means $G$ is an extension of $C_2 \\times C_2$ by $C_2$. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (abelian), and $D_4$, $Q_8$ (non-abelian).\n\n**Step 4: Use Kummer Theory to determine the group structure.**\nThe structure of the extension group $G$ is determined by the behavior of the lifts of automorphisms from $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $G$.\nAn automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has a lift $\\tilde{\\sigma} \\in G$ of order 2 if and only if $\\sigma(\\beta)/\\beta$ is a square in $K$. If it is not a square, any lift will have order 4.\nLet $\\bar{\\sigma}_2$ be the automorphism of $K$ sending $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}_2(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{4-2} = \\frac{4-4\\sqrt{2}+2}{2} = 3-2\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$.\nSince this is a square in $K$ (even in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$), there exists a lift $\\sigma_2 \\in G$ of $\\bar{\\sigma}_2$ such that $\\sigma_2^2 = \\text{id}$. So there is an element of order 2 in $G$ that does not fix $K$.\n\nLet $\\bar{\\sigma}_3$ be the automorphism of $K$ sending $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{2}$.\n$\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}_3(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{9-3} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6}$.\nFor this to be a square in $K$, $6$ must be a square in $K$. As shown in Step 2, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and a similar argument shows it is not a square in $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$.\nThus, $\\bar{\\sigma}_3(\\beta)/\\beta$ is not a square in $K$. This implies that any lift $\\sigma_3 \\in G$ of $\\bar{\\sigma}_3$ must have order 4 (specifically, $\\sigma_3^2=\\tau$).\n\nSo, the group $G$ has an element of order 4 (any lift of $\\bar{\\sigma}_3$) and an element of order 2 which is not in the center (the lift $\\sigma_2$ of $\\bar{\\sigma}_2$). Let's check if $G$ is abelian. If $G$ were abelian, $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ would commute. A detailed calculation shows that they do not commute. So $G$ must be non-abelian.\nThe non-abelian groups of order 8 are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n- $Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ has one element of order 2 ($-1$) and six elements of order 4 ($\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k$). The element of order 2 is central.\n- $D_4 = \\{e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\\}$ has five elements of order 2 ($r^2, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3$) and two elements of order 4 ($r, r^3$). The center is $\\{e, r^2\\}$.\n\nOur group $G$ has at least one element of order 4 (any lift $\\sigma_3$) and an element of order 2 not in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$ (the lift $\\sigma_2$).\nThe group $Q_8$ contains only one element of order 2, which must then correspond to $\\tau$. All other elements that don't fix $K$ must be of order 4. This contradicts our finding that a lift of $\\bar{\\sigma}_2$ has order 2.\nThe group $D_4$ has elements of order 2 that are not in the center. We can identify the lift $\\sigma_3$ with $r$ (order 4) and the lift $\\sigma_2$ with $s$ (order 2). The element $\\tau$ corresponds to $r^2$, the unique non-trivial element in the center. This is consistent with our findings.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8, $D_4$."
