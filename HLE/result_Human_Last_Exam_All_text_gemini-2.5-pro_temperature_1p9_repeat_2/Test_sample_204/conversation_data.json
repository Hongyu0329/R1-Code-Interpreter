    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the vector field and the map\n\nThe vector field is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n$n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThis is a unit vector, as $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The vector field represents a map from the 3D space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the unit sphere $S^2$. The variables $G$ and $f$ act as the polar and azimuthal angles on the sphere $S^2$, respectively.\n\nThe angles $G$ and $f$ depend on the spatial coordinates $(x,y,z)$ as follows:\n$f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$: This is the standard cylindrical/spherical azimuthal angle in the domain space. Let's denote it by $\\phi$.\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$, where $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2}$ and $\\rho = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of the map and boundary conditions\n\nThe Hopf charge is a topological invariant of a map from $S^3$ to $S^2$. We must first check if our map $\\mathbf{n}: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to S^2$ can be extended to a map from the compactified space $S^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3 \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ to $S^2$.\n\n*   **Behavior at infinity:** As $(x,y,z) \\to \\infty$, both $\\rho$ and $|z|$ go to infinity, which means $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\n    In this limit, $G = \\pi e^{-10 r_2} \\to \\pi e^{-\\infty} = 0$.\n    So, $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$.\n    The vector field at all points at infinity maps to a single point on the sphere (the North Pole). This means we can compactify $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^3$ and the map is well-defined.\n\n*   **Behavior at the core:** Let's find where the field points to the South Pole, $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,-1)$. This requires $G = \\pi$.\n    $G = \\pi \\iff \\pi e^{-10 r_2} = \\pi \\iff e^{-10 r_2} = 1 \\iff r_2 = 0$.\n    $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2} = 0 \\iff z=0$ and $\\rho^2 - 0.5 = 0$.\n    This defines a circle in the $z=0$ plane given by $x^2+y^2 = 0.5$. This circle is the \"core\" of the hopfion, where the field points downwards.\n\n*   **Singularities:** The angle $f=\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$ is undefined when $x=0$ and $y=0$, which corresponds to the entire $z$-axis. The vector field $\\mathbf{n}$ is therefore not defined on the $z$-axis. This is a line singularity.\n\n### Step 3: Use the topological interpretation of the Hopf charge\n\nThe Hopf charge $Q$ of a field configuration (a hopfion) is given by the product of two winding numbers, $Q = p \\times q$.\n\n*   **Toroidal Winding Number ($p$):** This number describes how the vector field winds as we travel around the axis of symmetry (the $z$-axis). Let's take a path that circles the $z$-axis at some radius $\\rho$ and height $z$. Along this path, the spatial azimuthal angle $\\phi = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$ changes from $0$ to $2\\pi$. The azimuthal angle on the sphere is given by $f=\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$. So, $f$ also goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$. The vector field winds around the equator of the target sphere $S^2$ exactly once. Therefore, the toroidal winding number is $p=1$.\n\n*   **Poloidal Winding Number ($q$):** This number describes how the vector field winds in any poloidal plane (e.g., a half-plane with $\\phi=\\text{constant}$). Let's consider the half-plane $y=0, x>0$. We trace a path from the core to infinity in this plane. A simple such path is along the positive $x$-axis from $x=\\sqrt{0.5}$ to $x\\to\\infty$.\n    - At the core point $x=\\sqrt{0.5}$, we have $r_2=0$, so $G=\\pi$. The field points to the South Pole.\n    - At infinity ($x \\to \\infty$), we have $r_2 \\to \\infty$, so $G=0$. The field points to the North Pole.\n    As we move from the core to infinity, the polar angle $G$ sweeps the full range from $\\pi$ to $0$. This path from South Pole to North Pole along a meridian covers half of a great circle on $S^2$. The full structure of the poloidal cross-section covers all angles on the sphere, making the map from the compactified poloidal plane to the sphere have degree 1. Therefore, the poloidal winding number is $q=1$.\n\nCombining these findings, the Hopf charge is $Q = p \\times q = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\n### Step 4: The Whitehead Formula and Linking Numbers (for verification)\n\nThe Hopf charge can also be calculated as the linking number of the preimages of two regular values (points) on the sphere $S^2$. A careful analysis shows that naive application of this method can be tricky due to the line singularity. For instance:\n\n*   The preimages of two opposite points on the equator, e.g., $(1,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,0)$, are two disjoint loops in the $xz$-plane that do not link, giving a linking number of 0.\n*   If one tries to use the preimage of the South Pole (a critical value, not a regular value), which is the core circle $x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$, and link it with the preimage of an equatorial point (e.g. $(1,0,0)$), one finds a linking number of 1.\n\nThe inconsistency arises from the singular nature of the field on the $z$-axis and the fact that poles are critical values. However, the physical structure described by the field—a vector field pointing \"up\" at infinity, \"down\" on a central ring, and wrapping toroidally around the symmetry axis—is the standard configuration for a hopfion of charge 1. The topological winding number argument is the most robust in this context.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe vector field has the characteristic structure of a hopfion. The toroidal winding number is 1, and the poloidal winding number is 1. The product of these gives the Hopf charge.\n\n$Q = 1$\n\n<<<1>>>"
