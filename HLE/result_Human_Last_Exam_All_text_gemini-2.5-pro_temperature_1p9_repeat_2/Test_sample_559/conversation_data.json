    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system.\n\n**1. Define the System**\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nLet's denote the functions as $d$ and $u$. The system operates in the $(u, d)$ phase plane, restricted to $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points exist where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case u = 0:**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    So, an equilibrium point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case u = 1:**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stability of Equilibrium Points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let $F(u,d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3+u^4$ and $G(u,d) = u^3-u^2$.\n$$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** $\\lambda_1 = 0$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$. This is a non-hyperbolic (degenerate) point.\n*   **At (1, 0):** $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)-2(1) = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = 4(0)+5(1)-3(1) = 2$. Both eigenvalues are positive, so $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   **At (1, -1):** $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)-2(1) = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1)+5(1)-3(1) = -4+5-3 = -2$. The eigenvalues are $1$ and $-2$, which have opposite signs. Thus, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n**4. Identify Separatrices**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that acts as a boundary between regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are always separatrices. The only saddle point is $(1,-1)$, so we will find its stable and unstable manifolds.\n\n*   **Stable Manifold of (1, -1):** This corresponds to the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$. The eigenvector $v=(v_u, v_d)$ satisfies $(J - \\lambda_2 I)v=0$.\n    $$J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) - 3+4 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    $$(J - (-2)I)v = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies 3v_u = 0 \\implies v_u=0$$\n    The eigenvector is of the form $(0, k)$, for any $k \\neq 0$. For instance, $(0,1)$. This vector is tangent to the vertical line $u=1$. Since $u=1$ is an invariant line ($u'(1) = 1^2(1-1) = 0$), the stable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ is the line $u=1$.\n\n*   **Unstable Manifold of (1, -1):** This corresponds to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$. The eigenvector satisfies $(J - \\lambda_1 I)v=0$.\n    $$(J - I)v = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$$\n    The eigenvector is of the form $(k, -2k)$, for any $k \\neq 0$. For instance, $(1,-2)$. This vector defines the slope of the unstable manifold at the point $(1, -1)$, which is $dv_d/dv_u = -2$.\n    Let's find the equation for this manifold. We can test for a simple polynomial trajectory, e.g., $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$.\n    The curve must pass through $(1, -1)$ and could potentially pass through another equilibrium point like $(0,0)$.\n    Passing through $(0,0) \\implies c=0$. So, $d=au^2+bu$.\n    Passing through $(1,-1) \\implies a+b=-1 \\implies b = -1-a$. So, $d=au^2-(a+1)u$.\n    Let's check if a curve of this form is a trajectory by substituting it into the equation for the orbits, $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$.\n    $$\\frac{d}{du}(au^2-(a+1)u) = \\frac{2(au^2-(a+1)u)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2-(a+1)u) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$$\n    By equating the polynomial coefficients on both sides of the equation after expanding (see thought process for details), we find that this identity holds true if and only if $a=-1$.\n    For $a=-1$, $b=-1-(-1)=0$. So the invariant curve is $d=-u^2$.\n    Let's verify: at $u=1, d=-1^2=-1$. It passes through the saddle. The slope is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2)|_{u=1}=-2u|_{u=1}=-2$, which matches the eigenvector direction.\n    Thus, the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$ is the parabola $d=-u^2$.\n\n**5. Determine \"the\" Separatrix**\nThe question asks for \"the\" separatrix, suggesting a single answer. We have found at least two: the stable manifold $u=1$ and the unstable manifold $d=-u^2$.\n*   The line $u=1$ is an invariant set, but it is not a single trajectory. It is composed of multiple vertical trajectories and two equilibrium points.\n*   The curve $d=-u^2$ represents two trajectories: one connecting $(1,-1)$ to $(0,0)$ for $u \\in [0,1]$ and another starting at $(1,-1)$ and going to $(\\infty, -\\infty)$ for $u>1$.\n*   A separatrix is typically an entire trajectory that separates phase space. The manifolds of saddle points are the most fundamental separatrices that structure the global dynamics. The unstable manifold of a saddle is a trajectory (or a set of trajectories) that forms a critical boundary.\nIn many contexts, the unstable manifold of a saddle point is considered the key separatrix. Given its nature as a specific trajectory that organizes the flow out of the saddle, $d=-u^2$ is the most appropriate answer for \"the separatrix.\"\n\nFinal verification that $d = -u^2$ is an invariant curve:\n$d' = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u u' = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nSubstituting $d = -u^2$ into the first ODE:\n$2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$= 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nThe expressions match, confirming that $d = -u^2$ is indeed a trajectory of the system.\n\n<<<d=-u^2>>>"
