    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 distinct, two-dimensional crystallographic groups that describe all possible repeating patterns in a plane. They are groups of isometries of the Euclidean plane.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, its corresponding point group is the group of symmetries of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed. It is obtained by considering all the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the wallpaper group while ignoring the translational components. The possible 2D crystallographic point groups are C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄, C₆, D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄, and D₆.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements it contains.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose associated point group has exactly 2 elements.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Point Groups of Order 2\n\nWe need to check the orders of all possible 2D crystallographic point groups and find which ones have an order of 2.\n\n1.  **Cyclic Groups (Cₙ):** The order of the cyclic group Cₙ is *n*.\n    *   C₁: Order 1\n    *   **C₂: Order 2**\n    *   C₃: Order 3\n    *   C₄: Order 4\n    *   C₆: Order 6\n\n2.  **Dihedral Groups (Dₙ):** The order of the dihedral group Dₙ is *2n*.\n    *   **D₁: Order 2 × 1 = 2**\n    *   D₂: Order 2 × 2 = 4\n    *   D₃: Order 2 × 3 = 6\n    *   D₄: Order 2 × 4 = 8\n    *   D₆: Order 2 × 6 = 12\n\nFrom this analysis, the only point groups with an order of 2 are **C₂** and **D₁**.\n\n*   **C₂** consists of the identity and a 180° rotation.\n*   **D₁** consists of the identity and a single reflection.\n\n### Step 3: Find Wallpaper Groups Associated with C₂ and D₁\n\nNow, we need to list the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones have C₂ or D₁ as their point group.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group C₂:**\n    This point group only contains a 2-fold rotation.\n    1.  **p2**: This group is characterized by 2-fold rotation centers and a primitive (oblique) lattice. It has no reflection or glide-reflection symmetries. Its point group is **C₂**.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group D₁:**\n    This point group contains a single reflection symmetry. Wallpaper groups with this point group may have reflections, glide reflections, or both.\n    2.  **pm**: This group has parallel reflection lines (mirrors). Its point group is **D₁**.\n    3.  **pg**: This group has parallel glide reflection lines. The point group of a glide reflection is the underlying reflection, so its point group is also **D₁**.\n    4.  **cm**: This group is based on a centered rectangular lattice and has interleaved reflection and glide reflection lines. Its point group is also **D₁**.\n\n### Step 4: List and Count the Identified Wallpaper Groups\n\nThe wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2 are:\n\n1.  **p2** (Point Group C₂, Order 2)\n2.  **pm** (Point Group D₁, Order 2)\n3.  **pg** (Point Group D₁, Order 2)\n4.  **cm** (Point Group D₁, Order 2)\n\nCounting these groups, we find there are a total of 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction between Wallpaper Group and Point Group:** A wallpaper group describes the full symmetry of a pattern, including translations. A point group only describes the symmetries that fix a point (rotations and reflections).\n*   **Multiple Wallpaper Groups for one Point Group:** It is possible for different wallpaper groups to share the same point group. This occurs with D₁ (pm, pg, cm) and D₂ (p2mm, p2mg, p2gg, c2mm), for instance. These wallpaper groups differ in the type of lattice or the arrangement and type of symmetries (e.g., reflection vs. glide reflection).\n*   **Glide Reflection's Point Group:** A glide reflection is a combination of a reflection and a translation parallel to the reflection line. When determining the point group, the translational component is ignored, leaving only the reflection. This is why the point group for a pattern with only glide symmetries (like **pg**) is D₁.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are 4 wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
