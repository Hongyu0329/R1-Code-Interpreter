The pharmacist should counsel Allison that her headache symptoms are highly suggestive of a migraine, not residual motion sickness. The most important recommendation is to ask Allison if she ever experiences any visual changes (like flashing lights, blind spots, or zigzag lines) or any numbness/tingling in her face or hands before or during her headaches. The pharmacist should explain that if she does have these symptoms (which would indicate a migraine with aura), her current birth control, Junel Fe, may significantly increase her risk of a stroke and she should contact her doctor immediately to discuss the safety of her medication and explore alternative contraceptive options.
