    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the SKI Combinator Expression\n\nThe given expression is:\n`Expr = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\nLet's break this down by identifying its components and applying the reduction rules of SKI calculus (`Sxyz = xz(yz)`, `Kxy = x`, `Ix = x`).\n\nThe expression has the top-level form `S(A)(B)(C)` where:\n*   `A = I`\n*   `B = S(I)(S(I)(K(T1)))`\n*   `C = T2`\n    *   with `T1 = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n    *   and `T2 = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nApplying the `S` rule `Sxyz = xz(yz)`:\n`Expr = A C (B C) = I T2 (B T2)`\nSince `I T2 = T2`, this simplifies to:\n`Expr = T2 (B T2)`\n\nNow, let's substitute `B` back in: `B T2 = S(I)(S(I)(K(T1))) T2`.\nThis is of the form `Sxyz` with `x=I`, `y=S(I)(K(T1))`, `z=T2`.\n`B T2 = I T2 (S(I)(K(T1)) T2) = T2 (S(I)(K(T1)) T2)`\n\nFinally, let's reduce the innermost part `S(I)(K(T1)) T2`.\nThis is of the form `Sxyz` with `x=I`, `y=K(T1)`, `z=T2`.\n`S(I)(K(T1)) T2 = I T2 (K T1 T2) = T2 (K T1 T2)`\nUsing the `K` rule `Kxy = x`, `K T1 T2 = T1`.\nSo, `S(I)(K(T1)) T2 = T2 (T1)`.\n\nSubstituting back up the chain:\n`B T2 = T2 ( T2 (T1) )`\n`Expr = T2 ( T2 (T2 (T1)) )`\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to `T2` applied to the result of `T2` applied to the result of `T2` applied to `T1`.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret Combinators as Church Numerals and Operators\n\nThe problem states that the expression is a Church integer `n`. Church numerals are functions that represent natural numbers. The standard operations on Church numerals relevant here are:\n*   **Exponentiation**: If `A` and `B` are Church numerals for `a` and `b`, the application `A B` represents the Church numeral for `b^a` (the second argument is the base, the first is the exponent).\n*   **Successor Function (SUCC)**: This function takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`. The combinator for `SUCC` is `S B`, where `B` is the function composition combinator.\n*   **Composition Combinator (B)**: `B f g x = f(g x)`. One of its SKI forms is `S(K(S))(K)`.\n\nLet's check the given expression parts:\n`S(S(K(S))(K))` is indeed `S B`, which is `SUCC`.\n\nBased on this, our expression `Expr = T2(T2(T2 T1))` represents the number `t1^(t2^3)`, where `t1` is the number for `T1` and `t2` is the number for `T2`.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the value of `t1`\n\n`T1 = S(S(K(S))(K))(I) = SUCC(I)`.\n*   `I` is the identity combinator. As a Church numeral, `I f x = f x`, which corresponds to `f` applied once to `x`. So, `I` represents the number `1`.\n*   `t1` is the value represented by `T1`. Therefore, `t1 = SUCC(1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the value of `t2`\n\n`T2 = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)) = SUCC(S(I)I)`.\n*   Let `M = S(I)I`. For `SUCC` to be applied, `M` must represent a Church numeral.\n*   `M` is the \"Mockingbird\" combinator: `M f = S(I)I f = I f (I f) = f f`.\n*   `M` is not in a standard Church numeral form. To determine the number it represents, we evaluate it in the context of Church numerals by applying it to the `SUCC` function and `0`: `m = M SUCC 0`.\n*   `m = (S(I)I SUCC) 0 = (SUCC SUCC) 0`.\n*   We need to find out what number the combinator `SUCC SUCC` represents. We apply it to a generic function `f` and argument `x`:\n    `(SUCC SUCC) f x = SUCC (SUCC f) x`\n    `= f ( (SUCC f) x )`\n    `= f ( f (f x) )`\n    `= f^3 x`\n*   This shows that `SUCC SUCC` is the Church numeral for the number `3`.\n*   Therefore, `m = (SUCC SUCC) 0 = 3 SUCC 0 = SUCC(SUCC(SUCC 0)) = 3`.\n*   So, the combinator `S(I)I` represents the number `3`.\n*   `t2` is the value represented by `T2`. Therefore, `t2 = SUCC(3) = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nWe have `t1 = 2` and `t2 = 4`. The expression represents the number `n = t1^{(t2^3)}`.\n*   `n = 2^{(4^3)}`\n*   `4^3 = (2^2)^3 = 2^{2*3} = 2^6 = 64`\n*   `n = 2^{64}`\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n*   `log_2(n) = log_2(2^{64}) = 64`\n\n<<<64>>>"
