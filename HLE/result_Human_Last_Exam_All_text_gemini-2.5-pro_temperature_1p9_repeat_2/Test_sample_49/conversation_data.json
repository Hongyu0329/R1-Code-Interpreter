    "An f-vector of a d-dimensional polytope is a sequence of integers $(f_0, f_1, f_2, ..., f_{d-1})$, where $f_i$ is the number of i-dimensional faces of the polytope. The question asks for the f-vector of a specific 4-polytope.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine this f-vector:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints given in the question.**\n*   **Polytope Type**: 4-dimensional polytope (a 4-polytope).\n*   **Number of Vertices ($f_0$)**: $f_0 = 6$.\n*   **Simpliciality**: The polytope is non-simplicial, meaning at least one of its 3-dimensional faces (facets or cells) is not a simplex. A 3-dimensional simplex is a tetrahedron.\n*   **Maximality Condition**: The polytope has the maximal number of 2-dimensional faces ($f_2$) possible for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Find the absolute maximum number of 2-faces for any 4-polytope with 6 vertices.**\nThe Upper Bound Theorem (UBT) in polytope theory states that the maximum number of faces of any dimension for a d-polytope with n vertices is achieved by the cyclic polytope, denoted $C_d(n)$. For our case, $d=4$ and $n=6$. The cyclic polytope $C_4(6)$ is a simplicial polytope. Its f-vector is known to be:\n$f(C_4(6)) = (f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3) = (6, 15, 18, 9)$.\nAccording to the UBT, for any 4-polytope with 6 vertices, its number of 2-faces $f_2$ must satisfy $f_2 \\le 18$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine if a non-simplicial 4-polytope can achieve this absolute maximum.**\nLet's assume there exists a non-simplicial 4-polytope, let's call it $P$, with the maximal possible number of 2-faces, so $f_2(P) = 18$.\n*   If a polytope's face count reaches the upper bound for one dimension $i > d/2-1$, it typically reaches the bound for all dimensions. Thus, $P$ would have the same f-vector as $C_4(6)$, which is $(6, 15, 18, 9)$.\n*   Let's analyze the properties of a polytope with f-vector $(6, 15, 18, 9)$:\n    *   $f_1 = 15 = \\binom{6}{2}$. This means every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Such a polytope is called 2-neighborly.\n    *   A consequence of being 2-neighborly is that all 2-faces must be triangles.\n    *   If all 2-faces are triangles, then all 3-dimensional facets must be polyhedra with only triangular faces (these are called deltahedra).\n    *   The polytope is stated to be non-simplicial, which means at least one of its facets must be a deltahedron that is not a tetrahedron. The simplest such deltahedra with 6 or fewer vertices are the triangular dipyramid (5 vertices, 6 triangular faces) and the octahedron (6 vertices, 8 triangular faces).\n*   Now we use a fundamental relation for polytopes: the sum of the number of faces of all facets equals twice the number of faces of the polytope. For 2-faces and 3-faces this is: $\\sum_{j=1}^{f_3} (\\text{number of 2-faces in facet } j) = 2 \\times f_2$.\n    For our hypothetical polytope $P$, we have $f_3=9$ and $f_2=18$. Let $n_T$ be the number of tetrahedral facets (4 faces each) and $n_{NS}$ be the number of non-simplicial facets. The total number of facets is $n_T + n_{NS} = 9$. The sum equation becomes $4n_T + \\sum_{k \\in \\text{non-simplicial}} k \\cdot n_k = 2 \\times 18 = 36$, where $k$ is the number of faces of a non-simplicial facet type.\n    Let's check the possibilities for non-simplicial facets:\n    - A triangular dipyramid has 6 faces.\n    - An octahedron has 8 faces.\n    Let $n_T$, $n_{D_3}$, $n_O$ be the number of facets of type Tetrahedron, Triangular Dipyramid, and Octahedron.\n    (1) $n_T + n_{D_3} + n_O + ... = 9$\n    (2) $4n_T + 6n_{D_3} + 8n_O + ... = 36$\n    Multiplying (1) by 4 gives: $4n_T + 4n_{D_3} + 4n_O + ... = 36$.\n    Subtracting this from (2) gives: $2n_{D_3} + 4n_O + ... = 0$.\n    Since the number of facets ($n_k$) must be non-negative integers, the only solution is $n_{D_3}=0, n_O=0, ...$. This implies there are no non-simplicial facets ($n_T=9$).\n*   This result contradicts our assumption that the polytope is non-simplicial. Therefore, a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices cannot have 18 2-faces.\n\n**Step 4: Find the maximal $f_2$ for a non-simplicial polytope.**\nSince $f_2=18$ is not possible, the maximal number of 2-faces for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices must be less than 18.\nThe complete enumeration of all combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices is known from the work of Altshuler and Steinberg. There are exactly three distinct f-vectors possible:\n1.  $(6, 15, 18, 9)$: This corresponds to the simplicial cyclic polytope $C_4(6)$.\n2.  $(6, 15, 17, 8)$: This corresponds to a non-simplicial polytope.\n3.  $(6, 13, 13, 6)$: This corresponds to another non-simplicial polytope (specifically, the pyramid over a square pyramid).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the correct f-vector.**\nThe question asks for the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with the maximal number of 2-faces. We compare the two possible non-simplicial f-vectors:\n*   For f-vector #2, $f_2=17$.\n*   For f-vector #3, $f_2=13$.\nThe maximum value of $f_2$ for a non-simplicial polytope is 17. The polytope that achieves this maximum has the f-vector $(6, 15, 17, 8)$. We can check that this is consistent with Euler's formula for 4-polytopes: $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 6 - 15 + 17 - 8 = -9 + 9 = 0$.\n\nThe f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is $(6, 15, 17, 8)$."
