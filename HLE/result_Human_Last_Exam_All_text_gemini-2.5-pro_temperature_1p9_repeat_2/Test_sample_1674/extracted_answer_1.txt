Yes, the theory can fail to hold. The initial process of inverting the system works under the implicit assumption that the light can be treated as a scalar field (i.e., it has a single, constant state of polarization). A birefringent medium's function is to alter the polarization of light in a way that depends on its input polarization and the orientation of the medium. By introducing it, the system can no longer be described by a simple scalar transmission matrix. An input beam with a single polarization will generally exit the birefringent medium with two polarization components. This converts the problem from a scalar one to a vectorial one. The original scalar inversion method is insufficient to characterize and reverse a vectorial system, thus the theory that a correct input can be found using the initial method will no longer hold.
