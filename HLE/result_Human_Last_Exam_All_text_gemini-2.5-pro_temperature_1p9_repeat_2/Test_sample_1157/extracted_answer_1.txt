**Management Plan:**
1.  **Immediate Management:** Urgent medical referral to an endocrinologist for management of uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%), which is the top priority. Prescribe systemic antibiotics, analgesics, and provide tetanus prophylaxis.
2.  **Acute Dental Care:** After initiating medical management, perform gentle debridement and irrigation of the sockets, followed by suturing the gums to facilitate healing and preserve bone. Replantation is contraindicated due to the 28-hour delay.
3.  **Provisional Replacement:** After initial soft tissue healing (1-2 weeks), fabricate an interim removable partial denture to restore aesthetics, function, and maintain space. Definitive treatment (implants or bridge) must be delayed until her diabetes is well-controlled (HbA1c < 7%) and the bone is fully healed (4-6 months).
4.  **Consideration of Skeletal Profile:** The SNB of 88Â° indicates a Class III skeletal pattern, which must be accounted for in the prosthetic design to ensure a stable bite and manage occlusal forces.

**Cells of Interest:**
The primary cells of interest regarding the avulsed teeth are the **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells**, whose death after 28 hours makes replantation futile. For the healing process, **osteoblasts** (bone formation), **fibroblasts** (soft tissue repair), and **inflammatory cells** (like neutrophils) are of critical interest, as their function is compromised by uncontrolled diabetes, leading to delayed healing and increased infection risk.

**Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Kind of Denture:** An **Interim Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**, also known as a flipper.
*   **Material:** An **acrylic resin base** with **wrought wire clasps** and acrylic teeth.
*   **Abutment Teeth:** The **left second premolar** and the **right central incisor**.
*   **Reasons for Abutment Choice:** The left second premolar provides direct retention and support adjacent to the missing teeth. The right central incisor is used for crucial **cross-arch stabilization**, preventing the denture from tipping or rotating, thus creating a stable and functional prosthesis.
