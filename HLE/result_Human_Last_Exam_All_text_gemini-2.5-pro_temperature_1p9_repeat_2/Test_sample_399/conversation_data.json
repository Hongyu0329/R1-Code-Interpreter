    "This is an initial value problem for a first-order ordinary differential equation. We will solve it using the method of separation of variables.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation and the initial condition.**\nThe differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$.\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$.\nThe goal is to find the value of $x(1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the variables.**\nFirst, we rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nSince the initial condition is $x(0) = -8 \\neq 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is not the trivial solution $x(t) = 0$. Therefore, we can safely divide both sides by $x^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Integrate both sides of the equation.**\nNow we integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nThe integral of the left side is:\n$$\n\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nThe integral of the right side is:\n$$\n\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t\n$$\nCombining these results and adding a constant of integration, C, we get the general solution in implicit form:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Use the initial condition to find the constant C.**\nWe are given that $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Write the particular solution for the initial value problem.**\nSubstitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate x(1).**\nWe need to find the value of $x$ when $t=1$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo combine the terms on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for $x(1)$:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
