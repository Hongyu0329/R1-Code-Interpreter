    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the French equivalent of the name \"Odobeccus\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Origin and Context of the Name \"Odobeccus\"**\n\n*   The first crucial point is to correctly identify the origin of the name. While the user asks for the equivalent of a \"Gaulish name\", historical records show \"Odobeccus\" was a Frankish kinglet who ruled at Cologne and was defeated by Clovis I.\n*   The Franks were a Germanic people, not Celtic Gauls. Therefore, the name \"Odobeccus\" is not Gaulish but Frankish (a West Germanic language), although it was used in the territory of former Gaul.\n*   The suffix \"-us\" is a Latinization added by chroniclers like Gregory of Tours, who wrote in Latin. The original Frankish name would have been closer to *Odobecc*.\n\n**Step 2: Break Down the Name into its Etymological Components**\n\nThe name is a compound, typical of Germanic names, made of two parts: `Odo-` and `-becc`.\n\n*   **`Odo-`**: This is a common element in Germanic names. It derives from the Proto-Germanic root `*audaz`, meaning \"wealth,\" \"riches,\" or \"property.\" It is not a Gaulish element.\n*   **`-beccus`**: This element is more complex. While the name itself is Germanic, the element `-beccus` is the well-known Gaulish word for \"beak.\" This suggests the name might be a Germanic-Gaulish hybrid, or that the element was adopted as a byname or descriptor. The meaning is \"beak,\" which could have been a nickname related to a physical feature.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Linguistic Evolution of Each Component into French**\n\nTo find the modern French equivalent, we must trace how each part evolved from its source language (Germanic and Gaulish) through Vulgar Latin and Old French into Modern French.\n\n*   **Evolution of `Odo-`**:\n    *   The Germanic personal name `Odo` was widely used in the Frankish empire.\n    *   In Old French, this name regularly evolved into **`Eudes`**. For example, the 9th-century king Odo of West Francia is known in modern French as *Eudes Ier*.\n    *   Another French form, `Odon`, also exists, but it is a more scholarly borrowing directly from the Latin form *Odo*, whereas `Eudes` is the natural phonetic evolution.\n\n*   **Evolution of `-beccus`**:\n    *   The Gaulish word `beccus` was adopted into the Vulgar Latin spoken in Gaul.\n    *   It evolved directly into the modern French word **`bec`**, which still means \"beak.\" This word is a rare example of a direct Gaulish loanword (besides place names) in modern French.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Modern Equivalent of the Full Name**\n\n*   The full, compound name \"Odobeccus\" did not survive into Modern French as a single given name or surname. It appears to have been the name of one specific historical individual and did not enter common usage.\n*   Therefore, there is no direct, one-word modern equivalent for \"Odobeccus.\"\n*   The most accurate way to answer is to provide the modern French equivalent of the main personal name element, which is `Odo`. The `-beccus` part would have been understood as a descriptor or nickname. In modern French, this would be translated as \"le Bec\" (\"the Beak\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe primary component of the name \"Odobeccus\" is the personal name `Odo`. The French name that naturally evolved from the Germanic `Odo` is `Eudes`. While the full name did not survive, its principal part has a clear French equivalent.\n\n<<<Eudes>>>"
