    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Who:** The subject must be a \"Christian theologian.\"\n2.  **What:** They must have \"first developed specialized terminology.\" This implies originality and a systematic vocabulary, not just a passing comment.\n3.  **Why:** This terminology is used to \"describe changes in the laws of nature.\"\n4.  **Application:** The terminology must be applicable to two specific and distinct theological concepts:\n    *   The \"virgin birth of Jesus,\" which is a miracle (an event contrary to the usual course of nature).\n    *   \"Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall,\" which is a doctrine about a fundamental shift in the state of the created order.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Central Theological/Philosophical Problem**\nThe question addresses the tension between the concept of fixed, universal laws of nature and the belief in divine actions (miracles) or historical events (the Fall) that appear to suspend, violate, or permanently alter these laws. A theologian addressing this would need a sophisticated framework that allows for God's freedom to act without making Him seem arbitrary or a violator of His own creation.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Potential Candidates**\n*   **Early Church Fathers:** This is a good place to start, as the question asks who \"first\" developed the terminology. Figures like Irenaeus and Origen discussed these topics, but they did not create a systematic philosophical vocabulary for it in the way the question implies.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** Augustine is a prime candidate. He thought deeply about creation, miracles, and the consequences of sin.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** Augustine, drawing from and adapting Stoic philosophy, developed the concept of ***rationes seminales*** (in Latin), which translates to \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal seeds.\"\n    *   **Analysis of Terminology:** Augustine proposed that God, at the moment of creation, implanted these \"seeds\" or latent potentialities for everything that would ever come into being. The regular, observable \"laws of nature\" are the unfolding of these seeds in their ordinary course. A miracle, then, is not God breaking the laws of nature (*contra naturam*), but rather God activating a \"seminal reason\" that lies outside the usual, expected sequence of events (*praeter naturam*).\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, the virgin birth was not a violation of nature itself, but the activation of a possibility that God had embedded within creation from the beginning. It was beyond the *usual* course of human reproduction but was made possible by a pre-ordained divine plan.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** Augustine's system can also account for the changes at the Fall. He argued that human mortality and the \"groaning\" of creation (e.g., decay, natural evils) were consequences of Adam's sin. This can be understood as sin causing a corruption or alteration in how the \"seminal reasons\" of creation unfold, unleashing potentialities for decay and death that were previously held in check by grace. Thus, the very operation of the natural world was changed.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274):** Aquinas built upon Augustine's work but developed his own distinct framework using Aristotelian metaphysics. He classified miracles as events *supra naturam* (above nature). While his system is incredibly detailed, he is not the one who *first* developed a specialized terminology for this specific purpose; he refined and systematized the tradition that Augustine largely initiated in the Latin West.\n*   **Modern Theologians (e.g., C.S. Lewis):** Lewis, in his book *Miracles*, provides famous analogies for how miracles can occur without \"breaking\" natural laws. However, he is a 20th-century figure building on a long history of thought and was not the *first* to develop this kind of terminology.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and Synthesize**\nAugustine of Hippo is the historical figure who best fits all the criteria. He was a major Christian theologian who was the first to develop a specialized philosophical vocabulary (*rationes seminales*) to provide a systematic explanation for how the \"laws of nature\" could be altered or bypassed by God. This framework was directly applicable to explaining miracles like the virgin birth and was foundational to his understanding of how the natural order was changed as a consequence of the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
