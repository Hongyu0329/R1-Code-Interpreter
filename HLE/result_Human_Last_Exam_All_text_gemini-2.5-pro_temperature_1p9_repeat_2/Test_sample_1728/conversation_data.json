    "An analysis of the question is provided below, with a list of careful points, followed by a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Understanding the \"Sum of Graphs\" Operation:** The term \"sum of graphs\" in this context refers to the graph join operation, not the disjoint union. The join of two graphs \\(G_1 = (V_1, E_1)\\) and \\(G_2 = (V_2, E_2)\\) is a graph \\(G_1 + G_2\\) with vertex set \\(V_1 \\cup V_2\\) and edge set \\(E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup \\{ (u, v) \\mid u \\in V_1, v \\in V_2 \\}\\). This means every vertex from the first graph is connected to every vertex from the second graph.\n2.  **Chromatic Number of the Join:** A key property of the graph join is that the chromatic number of the joined graph is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs: \\(\\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2)\\). This generalizes to the join of multiple graphs. This property is crucial for the solution.\n3.  **Cycle Length \\(n\\):** For a graph to be a cycle \\(C_n\\), its length \\(n\\) must be at least 3. The properties of cycles, especially their chromatic numbers, are well-defined for \\(n \\ge 3\\).\n4.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle \\(C_n\\):** The chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) is not constant; it depends on whether \\(n\\) is even or odd. This dependency is the reason why the problem asks for the *maximal* chromatic number.\n5.  **Interpreting \"Maximal\":** The question asks for the single largest possible value for the chromatic number of \\(G\\). This requires evaluating the chromatic number for all possible scenarios (i.e., for both even and odd \\(n\\)) and then selecting the largest result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the graph G and its structure.**\nThe graph \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\). Let these cycles be \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), and \\(C_C\\), all isomorphic to \\(C_n\\).\n\\( G = C_A + C_B + C_C \\)\nLet \\(V_A, V_B, V_C\\) be the vertex sets of these cycles, respectively. Each set has \\(n\\) vertices.\nBy the definition of the graph sum (join), the edge set of \\(G\\) includes:\n*   The edges of cycle \\(C_A\\).\n*   The edges of cycle \\(C_B\\).\n*   The edges of cycle \\(C_C\\).\n*   An edge between every vertex in \\(V_A\\) and every vertex in \\(V_B\\).\n*   An edge between every vertex in \\(V_A\\) and every vertex in \\(V_C\\).\n*   An edge between every vertex in \\(V_B\\) and every vertex in \\(V_C\\).\n\n**Step 2: Relate the structure of G to its chromatic number.**\nBecause every vertex in \\(V_A\\) is connected to every vertex in \\(V_B\\), any color used for a vertex in \\(V_A\\) cannot be used for any vertex in \\(V_B\\). This means the set of colors used on \\(V_A\\) and the set of colors used on \\(V_B\\) must be disjoint. The same logic applies to the pairs \\((V_A, V_C)\\) and \\((V_B, V_C)\\). Therefore, to color the entire graph \\(G\\), we need three mutually disjoint sets of colors, one for each cycle's vertices.\nThis leads to the property that the chromatic number of a join of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\n\\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_A) + \\chi(C_B) + \\chi(C_C) \\)\nSince \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), and \\(C_C\\) are all cycles of length \\(n\\), this simplifies to:\n\\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chromatic number of a cycle, \\(\\chi(C_n)\\).**\nThe value of \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) for \\(n \\ge 3\\) depends on the parity of \\(n\\):\n*   **Case 1: \\(n\\) is even.** An even cycle is a bipartite graph. Its vertices can be colored using only two colors by alternating them around the cycle. Therefore, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\) when \\(n\\) is even.\n*   **Case 2: \\(n\\) is odd.** An odd cycle is not bipartite. At least three colors are required to color its vertices. Three colors are also sufficient. Therefore, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\) when \\(n\\) is odd.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the possible values for \\(\\chi(G)\\).**\nUsing the formula from Step 2 and the values from Step 3, we can calculate the chromatic number of \\(G\\) for both cases of \\(n\\):\n*   **If \\(n\\) is even:** \\(\\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n*   **If \\(n\\) is odd:** \\(\\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the maximal chromatic number.**\nThe question asks for the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\). The possible values are 6 (for any even \\(n \\ge 4\\)) and 9 (for any odd \\(n \\ge 3\\)). The maximum of these values is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
