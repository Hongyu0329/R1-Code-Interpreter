    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the state-space matrices of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\n- State matrix: `A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n- Input matrix: `B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\n\nWe want to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a control law `u = -Fx`. The closed-loop system is described by `x_dot = (A - BF)x`. The goal is to place the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF` at the desired locations: `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. Given the desired eigenvalues `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`, the desired characteristic polynomial `p_d(s)` is:\n`p_d(s) = (s - λ1)(s - λ2)`\n`p_d(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n`p_d(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n**Step 3: Form the Closed-Loop System Matrix**\n\nLet the feedback gain matrix F be a general 2x2 matrix:\n`F = [f11, f12; f21, f22]`\n\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f11, f12; f21, f22] = [1*f11 + 2*f21, 1*f12 + 2*f22; 1*f11 + 0*f21, 1*f12 + 0*f22] = [f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22; f11, f12]`\n\nNext, form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF`:\n`A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] - [f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22; f11, f12]`\n`A_cl = [-1 - (f11 + 2*f21), 1 - (f12 + 2*f22); 1 - f11, 0 - f12]`\n`A_cl = [-1 - f11 - 2*f21, 1 - f12 - 2*f22; 1 - f11, -f12]`\n\n**Step 4: Find the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial `p_cl(s)` of `A_cl` is given by `det(sI - A_cl)`.\n`sI - A_cl = [s - (-1 - f11 - 2*f21), -(1 - f12 - 2*f22); -(1 - f11), s - (-f12)]`\n`sI - A_cl = [s + 1 + f11 + 2*f21, -1 + f12 + 2*f22; -1 + f11, s + f12]`\n\n`p_cl(s) = det(sI - A_cl) = (s + 1 + f11 + 2*f21)(s + f12) - (-1 + f12 + 2*f22)(-1 + f11)`\nExpanding this expression:\n`p_cl(s) = s^2 + s(f12) + s(1 + f11 + 2*f21) + f12(1 + f11 + 2*f21) - (1 - f11 - f12 + f11*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f11*f22)`\n`p_cl(s) = s^2 + s(1 + f11 + f12 + 2*f21) + (f12 + f11*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - 1 + f11 + f12 - f11*f12 + 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22)`\n`p_cl(s) = s^2 + s(1 + f11 + f12 + 2*f21) + (-1 + f11 + 2*f12 + 2*f12*f21 + 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22)`\n\n**Step 5: Equate the Coefficients of the Polynomials**\n\nWe now match the coefficients of `p_cl(s)` with `p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n\n1.  **Coefficient of `s`:**\n    `1 + f11 + f12 + 2*f21 = 2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 = 1`  (Equation 1)\n\n2.  **Constant term:**\n    `-1 + f11 + 2*f12 + 2*f12*f21 + 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22 = 2`\n    `f11 + 2*f12 + 2*f12*f21 + 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22 = 3`  (Equation 2)\n\n**Step 6: Solve for the Elements of F**\n\nWe have two equations and four unknowns, which means there are infinite solutions for F. We can find one valid solution by making a simplifying assumption. A common approach is to set the elements corresponding to one of the inputs to zero. Let's assume we only use the first input, which means `u2 = 0`. This is equivalent to setting the second row of F to zero.\nLet `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`.\n\nNow, our equations simplify significantly:\n\n1.  `f11 + f12 + 2(0) = 1` => `f11 + f12 = 1`\n2.  `f11 + 2*f12 + 2*f12(0) + 2(0) - 2*f11(0) = 3` => `f11 + 2*f12 = 3`\n\nWe now have a simple system of two linear equations:\na) `f11 + f12 = 1`\nb) `f11 + 2*f12 = 3`\n\nSubtracting equation (a) from equation (b):\n`(f11 + 2*f12) - (f11 + f12) = 3 - 1`\n`f12 = 2`\n\nSubstitute `f12 = 2` back into equation (a):\n`f11 + 2 = 1`\n`f11 = -1`\n\nSo, we have found one possible solution for F: `f11 = -1`, `f12 = 2`, `f21 = 0`, `f22 = 0`.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer**\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix F is:\n`F = [-1, 2; 0, 0]`\n\nWe can verify this result.\n`A_cl = A - BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] - [1, 2; 1, 0]*[-1, 2; 0, 0]`\n`A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] - [-1, 2; -1, 2]`\n`A_cl = [0, -1; 2, -2]`\nThe characteristic equation of `A_cl` is `det(sI - A_cl) = s(s+2) - (-1)(2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`, whose roots are indeed `-1 ± j`.\n\n<<<[-1, 2; 0, 0]>>>"
