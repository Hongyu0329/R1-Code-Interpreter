    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n**Step 1: Define the theory and the dimensionless coupling**\n\nWe start with the Euclidean Lagrangian for a single-component scalar field $\\phi$ theory:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{\\lambda_B}{4!} \\phi^4 $$\nwhere $\\lambda_B$ is the bare coupling constant. We work in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter. In $d$ dimensions, the canonical dimension of the field $\\phi$ is $[\\phi] = (d-2)/2$. For the action $S = \\int d^d x \\mathcal{L}$ to be dimensionless, the coupling constant $\\lambda_B$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\lambda_B] = 4-d = \\epsilon$.\n\nTo work with a dimensionless coupling constant, we introduce an arbitrary renormalization mass scale $\\mu$ and define the dimensionless coupling $u$ as:\n$$ \\lambda_R = u \\mu^\\epsilon $$\nHere, $\\lambda_R$ is the renormalized coupling, which has the same mass dimension as the bare coupling $\\lambda_B$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Beta Function**\n\nThe beta function, $\\beta(u)$, describes how the dimensionless coupling $u$ changes with the energy scale $\\mu$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mu} $$\nTo find the beta function, we must calculate the quantum corrections to the coupling. This is done by analyzing the loop diagrams that contribute to the four-point vertex function $\\Gamma^{(4)}$. The beta function can be shown to have the form:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + (\\text{quantum corrections}) $$\nThe term $-\\epsilon u$ arises from the engineering dimension of the original coupling constant.\n\nThe quantum corrections come from one-loop Feynman diagrams. For the $\\phi^4$ interaction, there are three one-loop diagrams that correct the four-point vertex. These are the s-channel, t-channel, and u-channel diagrams.\n\nEach of these diagrams has the same topological structure. The calculation, using dimensional regularization, reveals a divergence as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. In the Minimal Subtraction (MS) scheme, this divergence is cancelled by a counterterm, and the running of the coupling is determined by the coefficient of this divergence.\n\nFor the $\\phi^4$ theory with the interaction term $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$, the one-loop calculation yields the following beta function for the dimensionless coupling $u$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3 u^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(u^3) $$\n\n**Careful Points for Step 2:**\n*   **Convention for $\\lambda$**: The coefficient $\\frac{3}{16\\pi^2}$ depends on the normalization of the interaction term. The chosen form $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$ is standard and leads to this result.\n*   **Symmetry Factors**: The three diagrams (s, t, u) each have a symmetry factor of $1/2$, which is crucial for getting the correct coefficient.\n*   **Sign of the Beta Function**: The positive sign of the $u^2$ term is a key feature of $\\phi^4$ theory (and QED). It indicates that the theory is not asymptotically free. For small positive $\\epsilon$, the flow is towards the trivial fixed point ($u=0$) in the ultraviolet (high energy), and towards a non-trivial fixed point in the infrared (low energy).\n\n**Step 3: Find the Fixed Point**\n\nA fixed point, denoted by $u^*$, is a value of the coupling constant where the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling does not change with the energy scale. At a fixed point, the theory becomes scale-invariant.\nWe find the fixed points by solving the equation $\\beta(u^*) = 0$:\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions:\n\n1.  **The Gaussian (trivial) fixed point:**\n    $$ u^* = 0 $$\n    This corresponds to a free, non-interacting theory.\n\n2.  **The Wilson-Fisher (non-trivial) fixed point:**\n    For the non-zero solution, we can divide the equation by $u^*$:\n    $$ -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\n    Solving for $u^*$, we get:\n    $$ \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon $$\n    $$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3} $$\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe steps have clearly led to the expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling. This is the famous Wilson-Fisher fixed point, whose existence for $d<4$ (i.e., $\\epsilon>0$) is central to the modern understanding of critical phenomena. The expression is of first order in $\\epsilon$, which is what \"leading order\" implies in the context of the epsilon expansion.\n\nThe final answer is the derived expression for $u^*$.\n\n<<<u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3}>>>"
