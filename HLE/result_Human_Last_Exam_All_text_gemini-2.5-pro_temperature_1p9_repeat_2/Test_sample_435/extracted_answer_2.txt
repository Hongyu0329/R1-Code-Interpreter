CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to secrete higher levels of key effector cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), upon stimulation with their target antigen compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is because IL-15 promotes the development of a less-differentiated, more potent memory T cell phenotype with superior functional capacity and resistance to exhaustion.
