    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option:\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** The step typically begins from a fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Entrechat\" means interwoven or braided. \"Six\" refers to six movements of the legs crossing in the air. The dancer jumps vertically, and the legs beat against each other three times, resulting in six distinct positions or \"crossings\" (e.g., back, front, back, front, back, front).\n*   **Ending Position:** The definition of an `entrechat six` requires the dancer to land in the same fifth position they started from. If they started with the right foot in front, they land with the right foot in front. This is because an even number of beats that is not divisible by four (like two or six) returns the legs to their original configuration.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to understand how the number in `entrechat` affects the ending position. An `entrechat quatre` (four crossings) would land with the feet changed. An `entrechat six` does not.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically begins from a fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** `Échappé` means \"escaped,\" where the feet move from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second). `Battu` means \"beaten,\" indicating the legs beat together as they open. `Changé` means \"changed.\"\n*   **Ending Position:** The word `changé` explicitly states that the feet change position. If the dancer starts with the right foot in front, they will land in fifth position with the left foot in front.\n*   **Careful Point:** The term `changé` in the name of the step is the key giveaway. It signifies a change in the feet's position from start to end.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Often begins from a fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** `Assemblé` means \"to assemble.\" One leg brushes out while the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and then both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air before landing on both feet simultaneously in fifth position.\n*   **Ending Position:** The ending position can vary. An `assemblé dessus` (over) can finish with the same foot in front, but an `assemblé dessous` (under) will result in the feet changing position. Since an `assemblé` *can* change the leg position, it does not *always* end in the same position as it started.\n*   **Careful Point:** Unlike `entrechat six`, which has a fixed outcome for the leg position, `assemblé` is a category of step with variations that can either maintain or change the starting position.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically begins from a fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front.\n*   **Execution:** `Glissade` means \"to glide,\" and `derrière` means \"behind.\" The back foot glides out, and the front foot follows, closing into fifth position *behind* the other foot.\n*   **Ending Position:** The front foot from the start (right foot) is now the back foot at the end. The position has changed.\n*   **Careful Point:** The term `derrière` in this context indicates that the leading foot will close in the back, thus changing the fifth position. Similarly, a `glissade devant` would also change the feet.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically begins from a fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step resembling a `pas de chat`. It involves a double `rond de jambe en l'air` (one with each leg) while in the air. It is a traveling step.\n*   **Ending Position:** Due to the nature of the movement and the transfer of weight, a `gargouillade` typically ends with the feet having changed their starting orientation in fifth position. For example, if you start with the right foot in front, you often land with the left foot closing in front.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is an advanced allegro step. Its primary function is not to return to the starting position but to travel with a flourishing leg action, which results in a change of feet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, `Entrechat six` is the only step among the choices that, by its definition, must end with the legs in the exact same position (e.g., right foot in front) as it started. The other steps either explicitly state a change (`changé`, `derrière`) or have common variations that result in a change (`assemblé`, `gargouillade`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
