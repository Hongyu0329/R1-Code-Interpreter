    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the constraints imposed by the toroidal board and the non-attacking queens.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and Attack Rules**\nA 5x5 toroidal chessboard means the board wraps around on all sides. If we number the rows and columns from 0 to 4, any calculation on row or column indices is done modulo 5.\nA queen at position `(r, c)` attacks any square `(r', c')` that satisfies one of the following conditions:\n*   `r' = r` (same row)\n*   `c' = c` (same column)\n*   `r' - c' = r - c (mod 5)` (same main diagonal)\n*   `r' + c' = r + c (mod 5)` (same anti-diagonal)\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Non-Attacking Conditions**\nWe need to place 4 queens, let's say at positions `(r1, c1)`, `(r2, c2)`, `(r3, c3)`, and `(r4, c4)`. For them to be non-attacking, any two queens `(ri, ci)` and `(rj, cj)` (where `i ≠ j`) must not attack each other. This means for all pairs `i ≠ j`:\n*   `ri ≠ rj`\n*   `ci ≠ cj`\n*   `ri - ci ≠ rj - cj (mod 5)`\n*   `ri + ci ≠ rj + cj (mod 5)`\n\nThese four conditions imply that the 4 rows `{r1, r2, r3, r4}` must be distinct, the 4 columns `{c1, c2, c3, c4}` must be distinct, the 4 main diagonals `{r1-c1, r2-c2, ...}` must be distinct (mod 5), and the 4 anti-diagonals `{r1+c1, r2+c2, ...}` must be distinct (mod 5).\n\n**Step 3: The \"Hole\" Concept**\nSince we are placing 4 queens on a 5x5 board, in any valid configuration, there will be exactly:\n*   One empty row. Let's call it `r_m`.\n*   One empty column, `c_m`.\n*   One empty main diagonal, `d_m`.\n*   One empty anti-diagonal, `s_m`.\n\nThese \"missing\" or \"empty\" lines are determined by the queen positions. A crucial insight comes from the relationship between these empty lines. The set of occupied rows is `Z_5 \\ {r_m}`, occupied columns is `Z_5 \\ {c_m}`, etc. The sum of all elements in `Z_5 = {0,1,2,3,4}` is 10, which is 0 (mod 5).\nWe can show that `d_m = (r_m - c_m) mod 5` and `s_m = (r_m + c_m) mod 5`.\nThis means that for any valid configuration, there is a unique square on the board, `(r_m, c_m)`, which is not occupied by a queen and is also not attacked by any queen. We call this square the \"hole\". The existence of a valid configuration implies the existence of a unique hole. Conversely, we can try to count configurations by first choosing a hole.\n\n**Step 4: Using Symmetry**\nThe toroidal board has a high degree of symmetry. Specifically, it is translationally invariant. If we have a valid configuration of queens, we can translate the entire configuration by a vector `(a, b)` (modulo 5), and the result will also be a valid configuration.\n`{(r1, c1), ..., (r4, c4)}` is a solution -> `{(r1+a, c1+b), ..., (r4+a, c4+b)}` is a solution.\n\nLet `k(r, c)` be the number of valid 4-queen configurations where the hole is at square `(r, c)`. Due to the translational symmetry, this number is the same for all 25 squares.\n`k(r, c) = k(0, 0)` for any `(r,c)`.\nThe total number of ways to place the queens is the sum of `k(r, c)` over all 25 squares.\nTotal ways = `25 * k(0, 0)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate k(0, 0)**\nWe need to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens such that the hole is at `(0, 0)`.\n*   Hole at `(0, 0)` means `r_m = 0` and `c_m = 0`.\n*   This implies the queens must be placed in rows from the set `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   The columns must also be from the set `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   This setup can be described by a permutation `p` of `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, where the queen in row `i` is placed in column `p(i)`. The positions are `(i, p(i))` for `i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nNow, we check the diagonal constraints:\n*   The missing main diagonal `d_m = r_m - c_m = 0 - 0 = 0 (mod 5)`. The occupied diagonals `{i - p(i) mod 5}` must be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. This means `i - p(i) ≠ 0 (mod 5)`. Since `i` and `p(i)` are in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, this is equivalent to `p(i) ≠ i`. The permutation `p` must be a **derangement**.\n*   The missing anti-diagonal `s_m = r_m + c_m = 0 + 0 = 0 (mod 5)`. The occupied anti-diagonals `{i + p(i) mod 5}` must be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of derangements `p` of `{1, 2, 3, 4}` such that the set of sums `{i + p(i) mod 5 | i ∈ {1,2,3,4}}` consists of four distinct non-zero values.\n\nThe number of derangements of 4 items is 9. We can list and check them:\nThe permutations `p` map the indices `(1, 2, 3, 4)` to their values.\n1.  `p = (2, 1, 4, 3)`: Diagonals `d = {i-p(i)}` are `{1-2, 2-1, 3-4, 4-3}` = `{4,1,4,1}` mod 5. Not distinct. Fails.\n2.  `p = (2, 3, 4, 1)`: Diagonals `d` are `{4,4,4,3}` mod 5. Not distinct. Fails.\n3.  `p = (2, 4, 1, 3)`:\n    *   `d` = `{1-2, 2-4, 3-1, 4-3}` = `{4,3,2,1}` mod 5. Distinct. OK.\n    *   `s` = `{1+2, 2+4, 3+1, 4+3}` = `{3,1,4,2}` mod 5. Distinct. OK.\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n4.  `p = (3, 1, 4, 2)`:\n    *   `d` = `{1-3, 2-1, 3-4, 4-2}` = `{3,1,4,2}` mod 5. Distinct. OK.\n    *   `s` = `{1+3, 2+1, 3+4, 4+2}` = `{4,3,2,1}` mod 5. Distinct. OK.\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n5.  `p = (3, 4, 1, 2)`: Diagonals `d` are `{3,3,2,2}` mod 5. Not distinct. Fails.\n6.  `p = (3, 4, 2, 1)`: Diagonals `d` are `{3,3,1,3}` mod 5. Not distinct. Fails.\n7.  `p = (4, 1, 2, 3)`: Diagonals `d` are `{2,1,1,1}` mod 5. Not distinct. Fails.\n8.  `p = (4, 3, 1, 2)`: Diagonals `d` are `{2,4,2,2}` mod 5. Not distinct. Fails.\n9.  `p = (4, 3, 2, 1)`: Diagonals `d` are `{2,4,1,3}` mod 5 (Distinct), but diagonals `s` are `{0,0,0,0}` mod 5 (Not distinct). Fails.\n\nBy checking all 9 derangements, we find exactly 2 valid permutations.\nTherefore, `k(0, 0) = 2`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\nThe total number of ways is `25 * k(0, 0)`.\nTotal ways = `25 * 2 = 50`."
