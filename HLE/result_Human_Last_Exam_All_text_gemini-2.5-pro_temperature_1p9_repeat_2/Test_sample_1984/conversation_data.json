    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation and the function governing the dynamics.**\nThe given ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$$\nThis is an autonomous one-dimensional ODE of the form $x' = f(x)$, where $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe term in the parentheses is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^{2} = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor zero:\n*   $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n*   $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x_0$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, i.e., $f'(x_0)$.\n*   If $f'(x_0) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive, and we must use other methods.\n\nLet's first compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    Evaluate $f'(0)$:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    Evaluate $f'(1)$:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the stability of $x=1$ using a different method.**\nWhen the first derivative test is inconclusive, we can analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point. This is often visualized using a phase line.\nOur function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n*   **Consider a value slightly greater than 1**, e.g., $x=2$.\n    $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2$. Since $f(x) < 0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing. This means solutions starting to the right of 1 will move towards 1.\n*   **Consider a value between 0 and 1**, e.g., $x=0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125$. Since $f(x) < 0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing. This means solutions starting to the left of 1 (but greater than 0) will move away from 1 (towards 0).\n\nAn equilibrium point is stable only if solutions on *both* sides of it move towards it. For $x=1$, solutions to the right move towards it, but solutions to the left move away from it. This type of point is called semi-stable or half-stable. In the context of Lyapunov stability, a semi-stable point is considered **unstable**.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$.**\nBased on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium point.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final value.**\nThe question asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
