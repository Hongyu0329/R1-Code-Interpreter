    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of a group and checking sets of increasing size.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of a Group:**\n    A group is a set G, combined with a binary operation `·`, denoted as (G, `·`), that satisfies four fundamental properties (called group axioms):\n    *   **Closure:** For any two elements a and b in G, the result of the operation, a `·` b, is also in G. The problem statement ensures this by saying `·` is a binary operation defined *on* the set G.\n    *   **Associativity:** For all a, b, and c in G, the equation (a `·` b) `·` c = a `·` (b `·` c) holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** There exists an element e in G such that for every element a in G, the equation e `·` a = a `·` e = a holds.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For each element a in G, there exists an element b in G (the inverse of a) such that a `·` b = b `·` a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\n    The question asks for the smallest size `n` of a set G where we can define a binary operation `·` such that at least one of the axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) fails.\n\n2.  **Analyze Case n=0 (Empty Set):**\n    If G is the empty set (n=0), it contains no elements. The group axiom for the identity element states \"There exists an element e in G...\". Since the empty set has no elements, this axiom cannot be satisfied. Therefore, the empty set cannot be a group. However, it is a standard convention in abstract algebra to define groups on *non-empty* sets. So, we assume n must be a positive integer (n ≥ 1).\n\n3.  **Analyze Case n=1:**\n    Let G be a set with one element, say G = {a}.\n    *   **Define the binary operation:** A binary operation is a function from G × G to G. Here, G × G has only one element: (a, a). The result of the operation a `·` a must be an element of G. Since G only contains 'a', the only possible definition for the binary operation is `a · a = a`.\n    *   **Check the group axioms:**\n        *   **Closure:** a `·` a = a, which is in G. This is satisfied.\n        *   **Associativity:** We need to check (x `·` y) `·` z = x `·` (y `·` z). The only choice is x=y=z=a. (a `·` a) `·` a = a `·` a = a. And a `·` (a `·` a) = a `·` a = a. So, associativity holds.\n        *   **Identity Element:** We need an element e such that e `·` x = x `·` e = x. Let's try e = a. We check if a `·` a = a. This is true by our definition. So, 'a' is the identity element.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** For each element, we need an inverse. The only element is 'a', and the identity is 'a'. We need an element x in G such that a `·` x = a. The only choice is x=a, and a `·` a = a holds. So, 'a' is its own inverse.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=1:** All four group axioms are satisfied. Since this is the *only* possible binary operation on a one-element set, any set of size 1 with a binary operation is *always* a group (this is known as the trivial group). It is impossible to construct a non-group for n=1.\n\n4.  **Analyze Case n=2:**\n    Let G be a set with two elements, say G = {x, y}. We need to see if it is *possible* to define a binary operation `·` such that (G, `·`) is not a group. We only need to find one such example.\n\n    Let's try to construct a binary operation that fails one of the axioms. For instance, let's define an operation where there is no identity element.\n\n    *   **Define a binary operation:** Consider the operation defined by the following table (a Cayley table):\n| `·` | x | y |\n|---|---|---|\n| x | x | x |\n| y | y | y |\n\n    *   **Check the group axioms:**\n        *   **Closure:** All the results in the table ('x' and 'y') are elements of G. So closure is satisfied.\n        *   **Identity Element:** Let's search for an identity element 'e'.\n            *   Could 'x' be the identity? For 'x' to be the identity, we would need `x · y = y`. But according to our table, `x · y = x`. So 'x' cannot be the identity element.\n            *   Could 'y' be the identity? For 'y' to be the identity, we would need `y · x = x`. But according to our table, `y · x = y`. So 'y' cannot be the identity element.\n        *   Since neither element in G can serve as the identity element, the identity axiom fails.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for n=2:** We have successfully defined a binary operation on a set of 2 elements for which the resulting structure is not a group.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\n*   For n=1, any binary operation on the set necessarily forms a group.\n*   For n=2, we were able to construct an example of a binary operation that does not form a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number `n` for which such a set and operation exist is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
