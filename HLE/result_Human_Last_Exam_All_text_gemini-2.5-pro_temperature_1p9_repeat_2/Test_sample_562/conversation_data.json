    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character:** The Japanese character 謄 is a *jōyō kanji*. We first need to break it down into its constituent parts to identify the radical. The character has a left-right structure.\n    *   **Left side:** The component on the left is 言.\n    *   **Right side:** The component on the right is 朕.\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):** In kanji with a left-right structure, the radical is very often the left-side component. The radical determines the general semantic category of the character.\n    *   The left-side component is 言, which means \"words,\" \"to say,\" or \"speech.\"\n    *   The meaning of the full character 謄 is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is semantically related to words, writing, and documents.\n    *   Therefore, the radical (bushu) of 謄 is 言.\n\n3.  **Find the Name of the Radical:** Radicals in Japanese have specific names, which often depend on their position within a character.\n    *   The radical is 言.\n    *   When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it is known as a *hen* (へん).\n    *   The specific name for the 言 radical when used as a *hen* is **ごんべん (gonben)**. This name comes from its on'yomi reading *gen* (which becomes *gon* due to a phonetic change called rendaku) combined with *hen* (which becomes *ben*).\n\n4.  **Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization:** The final step is to write the Japanese name ごんべん using the Hepburn transcription system.\n    *   ご (go) + ん (n) + べ (be) + ん (n) = **Gonben**\n\nFollowing the example provided (\"媛\" -> \"Onnahen\"), our process correctly identifies the radical (言), its positional name (gonben), and its Hepburn transcription.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
