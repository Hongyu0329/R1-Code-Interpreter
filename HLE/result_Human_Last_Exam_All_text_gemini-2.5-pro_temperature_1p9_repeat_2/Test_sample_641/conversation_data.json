    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We are looking for the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understanding PSU(n, q) and Involutions in a Quotient Group**\n*   The group in question is $G = \\text{PSU}(n,q)$ with $n=4$ and $q=997$.\n*   $\\text{PSU}(n,q)$ is the quotient group $\\text{SU}(n,q) / Z(\\text{SU}(n,q))$, where $\\text{SU}(n,q)$ is the special unitary group and $Z(\\text{SU}(n,q))$ is its center.\n*   An element $gZ \\in G/Z$ is an involution if it is not the identity element ($g \\notin Z$) and its square is the identity element ($(gZ)^2=Z$, which means $g^2 \\in Z$).\n*   The center $Z(\\text{SU}(n,q))$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n=1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. Its order is $d = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\n*   For our case, $n=4$ and $q=997$. The order of the center is $d = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\n*   The center is $Z = \\{I, -I\\}$, where $I$ is the $4 \\times 4$ identity matrix.\n*   The condition for an element $g \\in \\text{SU}(4,997)$ to represent an involution in $\\text{PSU}(4,997)$ is that $g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}$ and $g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}$.\n*   This means we need to count the elements in $\\text{SU}(4,997)$ that satisfy either $g^2=I$ (and $g \\ne \\pm I$) or $g^2=-I$.\n*   Let $N_1'$ be the number of non-central involutions in $\\text{SU}(4,997)$ (i.e., $g^2=I, g \\neq I, -I$).\n*   Let $N_2$ be the number of elements in $\\text{SU}(4,997)$ such that $g^2=-I$.\n*   The total number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4,997)$ is given by $\\frac{N_1' + N_2}{|Z|} = \\frac{N_1' + N_2}{2}$.\n\n**2. Counting Non-central Involutions in SU(4, q) ($N_1'$)**\n*   An involution in $\\text{SU}(n,q)$ (for odd $q$) is a semisimple element with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. Since the determinant must be 1, the number of eigenvalues equal to -1, say $k$, must be even.\n*   For $n=4$, possible values for $k$ are $k=2$ and $k=4$.\n*   If $k=4$, the eigenvalues are all -1, so the element is $-I$. This is a central element, so we don't count it in $N_1'$.\n*   If $k=2$, the eigenvalues are $\\{-1, -1, 1, 1\\}$. These elements are not central. They form a single conjugacy class in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$.\n*   An involution of this type is specified by its (-1)-eigenspace, which must be a 2-dimensional non-degenerate subspace. The number of such subspaces is given by the size of the corresponding conjugacy class in the unitary group $U(4,q)$.\n*   Number of such involutions is $\\frac{|U(4,q)|}{|U(2,q)| \\cdot |U(2,q)|}$.\n*   Using the formula $|U(n,q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2}\\prod_{i=1}^n(q^i-(-1)^i)$:\n    *   $|U(4,q)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$\n    *   $|U(2,q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)$\n*   $N_1' = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2} = \\frac{q^4(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)}$\n    $N_1' = \\frac{q^4(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**3. Counting Elements with $g^2=-I$ in SU(4, q) ($N_2$)**\n*   Let $g \\in \\text{SU}(4,q)$ be such that $g^2=-I$. Its minimal polynomial is $x^2+1=0$.\n*   We need to consider the properties of roots of $x^2+1=0$. Let $i$ be a root.\n*   Since $q=997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, $-1$ is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_{997}$. Thus, $i \\in \\mathbb{F}_{997}$, and its conjugate is $\\bar{i} = i^q = i$.\n*   The eigenvalues of $g$ must be $i$ or $-i$. For a matrix in $U(n,q)$, if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue, then $1/\\bar{\\lambda}$ must also be an eigenvalue with the same multiplicity. For $\\lambda=i$, we have $1/\\bar{i} = 1/i = -i$. Thus, eigenvalues must come in pairs $(i, -i)$.\n*   For $n=4$, the set of eigenvalues must be $\\{i,i,-i,-i\\}$. The determinant is $i^2(-i)^2=1$, so any such element in $U(4,q)$ is automatically in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$.\n*   The eigenspaces $V_i$ and $V_{-i}$ are totally isotropic. For such elements in $U(2m,q)$ (with $m=n/2$), it is a known result (from Wall's work on classical groups) that they form a single conjugacy class, and their centralizer is isomorphic to the general linear group $\\text{GL}(m,q) = \\text{GL}(2,997)$.\n*   The number of such elements is the size of the conjugacy class in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$, which is $\\frac{|\\text{SU}(4,q)|}{|C_{\\text{SU}(4,q)}(g)|}$.\n*   The centralizer is $C_{\\text{SU}(4,q)}(g) \\cong \\text{GL}(2,q)$.\n*   $|\\text{SU}(4,q)| = \\frac{|U(4,q)|}{q+1} = q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$.\n*   $|\\text{GL}(2,q)| = (q^2-1)(q^2-q) = q(q-1)(q^2-1)$.\n*   $N_2 = \\frac{q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q(q-1)(q^2-1)} = \\frac{q^5(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q-1}$\n    $N_2 = \\frac{q^5(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)}{q-1} = q^5(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n*   The number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4,997)$ is:\n    $I = \\frac{N_1' + N_2}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} [q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^5(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)]$\n*   Factor out common terms:\n    $I = \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) [1 + q(q+1)^2]$\n*   Simplify the term in the brackets:\n    $1 + q(q^2+2q+1) = 1+q^3+2q^2+q = (q+1)(q^2+q+1)$.\n*   So, $I = \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)(q+1)(q^2+q+1)$.\n*   Using the identity $(a-b)(a+b)=a^2-b^2}$ on the last two terms via $(q^2+1-q)(q^2+1+q)$, we get $(q^2+1)^2-q^2=q^4+2q^2+1-q^2=q^4+q^2+1$.\n*   The final formula for the number of involutions is:\n    $I = \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q+1)(q^2+1)(q^4+q^2+1)$.\n*   Substituting $q=997$:\n    $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (997+1) \\cdot (997^2+1) \\cdot (997^4+997^2+1)$\n    $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot 998 \\cdot (997^2+1) \\cdot (997^4+997^2+1)$\n    $I = 499 \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (997^2+1) \\cdot (997^4+997^2+1)$.\n\nThe question asks for \"the number\", which is this value. A formula expressed in terms of $q=997$ is the standard way to represent such large numbers in this context.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nLet $q=997$. The number of involutions is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2}q^4(q+1)(q^2+1)(q^4+q^2+1)$."
