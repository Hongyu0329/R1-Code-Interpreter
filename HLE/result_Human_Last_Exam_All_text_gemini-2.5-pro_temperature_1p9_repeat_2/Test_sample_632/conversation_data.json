    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Context:** The square that hosts the Pantheon.\n    *   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed by the city administration\".\n    *   **Timeframe:** This removal occurred in or around the year **1950**.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify what this feature was.\n\n2.  **List of Careful Points and Potential Issues:**\n    *   The date \"1950\" is very specific and must be treated as a key piece of evidence. However, historical questions can sometimes contain inaccuracies, so this date needs verification.\n    *   The feature is described as \"unique\" and \"architectural,\" suggesting it was not a minor element like a statue or street furniture, but a significant structure or pair of structures.\n    *   The phrase \"removed by the city administration\" points to a planned demolition or urban renewal project, not accidental destruction.\n    *   It's important to distinguish this removed feature from the elements still present in the piazza, such as the Renaissance fountain (Fontana del Pantheon) and the Egyptian obelisk that was added to it in 1711.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Initial Research:** A search for significant architectural features removed from the Piazza della Rotonda points overwhelmingly to one famous example: **the twin neoclassical pavilions**.\n    *   **Description of the Feature:** These two symmetrical buildings flanked the north side of the piazza. They were designed by the architect Luigi Poletti and constructed between 1823-1826. Due to their appearance framing the Pantheon, they were controversially nicknamed the *\"orecchie di asino\"* (the donkey's ears) of the Pantheon. They housed shops and offices and were a defining, though debated, characteristic of the piazza's 19th-century appearance.\n    *   **Verification of Removal:** Historical records confirm that these pavilions were indeed removed by government order. The initiative was led by the Minister of Public Education, Guido Baccelli, as part of a late 19th-century campaign to \"liberate\" ancient monuments from later additions that were seen as obstructing the original view.\n    *   **Addressing the Date Discrepancy:** This is the most critical step. While the twin pavilions perfectly match the description of a \"unique architectural feature removed by the city administration,\" all reliable historical sources state their demolition occurred between **1882 and 1883**, not in 1950. There is no documented record of another major architectural feature being removed from the piazza in 1950.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It is almost certain that the question is referring to the twin neoclassical pavilions but contains a significant error regarding the date of their removal. The description of the feature and the reason for its removal align perfectly with the history of the pavilions, but not with the year 1950. Therefore, the answer identifies the feature while acknowledging the probable error in the question's premise.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe architectural feature in question was a pair of twin neoclassical pavilions, which were known pejoratively as the \"donkey's ears\" of the Pantheon.\n\n<<<The twin neoclassical pavilions>>>"
