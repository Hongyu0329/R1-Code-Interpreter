    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's ensure we have a clear understanding of the terminology used in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `a, b ∈ S` (where `a` and `b` can be the same element), their product `ab` is not in `S`. In set notation, `S · S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion (or simply maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means if you add any element `g ∈ G \\ S` to `S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Fills:** A subset `S` of `G` *fills* `G` if `G = S ∪ S · S ∪ {e}`, where `e` is the identity element of `G`. This means every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or can be written as a product of two elements from `S`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is *filled* if **every** maximal product-free set in `G` fills `G`. This is a strong condition. It is not sufficient for just one such set to fill `G`; all of them must.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Group Properties\n\nThe question specifies three key properties for the group `G`:\n1.  **Finite:** The group `G` has a finite number of elements.\n2.  **Nonabelian:** There exist at least two elements `a, b ∈ G` such that `ab ≠ ba`.\n3.  **Order:** The order of the group is `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime number and `m` is a natural number (m ≥ 1).\n\n### Step 3: Utilize the Classification of Filled Groups\n\nThis problem can be solved efficiently by using a known classification theorem from group theory. The theorem provides a complete list of all finite filled groups.\n\n**Theorem (Classification of Finite Filled Groups):** A finite group `G` is filled if and only if `G` is isomorphic to one of the following seven groups:\n1.  `C₂ × C₂` (the Klein four-group)\n2.  `C₃` (the cyclic group of order 3)\n3.  `C₄` (the cyclic group of order 4)\n4.  `C₅` (the cyclic group of order 5)\n5.  `S₃` (the symmetric group on 3 elements)\n6.  `C₃ × C₃` (the elementary abelian group of order 9)\n7.  `Dic₃` (the dicyclic group of order 12)\n\nOur task now simplifies to checking which of these seven groups satisfy the conditions of being nonabelian and having an order of the form `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Candidate Groups\n\nWe will filter the list of seven filled groups based on the given criteria.\n\n**A. Check for the Nonabelian Property:**\n*   `C₂ × C₂`, `C₃`, `C₄`, `C₅`, and `C₃ × C₃` are all abelian groups. Therefore, they are not solutions.\n*   `S₃` and `Dic₃` are nonabelian groups. These are our remaining candidates.\n\n**B. Check the Order of the Remaining Candidates:**\nWe need to check if the orders of `S₃` and `Dic₃` can be expressed in the form `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: `S₃` (the symmetric group of order 6)**\n    *   **Order:** `|S₃| = 6`.\n    *   **Check the form `2q^m`:** We need to see if `6 = 2q^m`.\n        *   `6 = 2 × 3`.\n        *   Let `q = 3`. This is an odd prime.\n        *   Let `m = 1`. This is a natural number.\n    *   So, `|S₃| = 2 × 3¹`. This perfectly matches the required form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** `S₃` is a nonabelian filled group of order `2q^m`.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: `Dic₃` (the dicyclic group of order 12)**\n    *   **Order:** `|Dic₃| = 12`.\n    *   **Check the form `2q^m`:** We need to see if `12 = 2q^m`.\n        *   `12 = 2 × 6`.\n        *   We need `6` to be of the form `q^m` where `q` is an odd prime.\n        *   The prime factorization of 6 is `2 × 3`. Since it has a factor of 2, it cannot be expressed as a power of a single *odd* prime.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The order of `Dic₃` does not match the required form `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Result\n\nAfter systematically checking all possible finite filled groups against the given conditions, only one group satisfies all criteria. The only nonabelian filled group of order `2q^m` (for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`) is the symmetric group `S₃`.\n\n---\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n1.  **Definition of Filled:** The crucial part is that *every* maximal product-free set must fill the group, not just one.\n2.  **Classification Theorem:** The solution relies on the complete classification of finite filled groups. This powerful theorem simplifies the problem immensely.\n3.  **Order Constraint:** The form of the order `2q^m` must be strictly adhered to. The number `q` must be an odd prime, and the factor alongside the 2 must be a power of *that single prime*. This is why `|G|=12` was excluded, as `12 = 2 × 6`, and `6` is not a power of an odd prime.\n4.  **Nonabelian Property:** Filtering out the five abelian groups from the classification list is a necessary first step.\n\n<<<S₃>>>"
