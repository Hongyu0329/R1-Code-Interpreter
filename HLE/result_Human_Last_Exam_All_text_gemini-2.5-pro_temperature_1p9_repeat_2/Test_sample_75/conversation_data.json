    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the \"Second Great War\"**: This term refers to the series of major conflicts depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). The primary antagonist of this war is the fallen Xel'naga, Amon, and his various forces.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date**: The war officially begins at the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to official StarCraft lore and timelines, the Zerg Swarm, partially under Amon's influence, launches a new invasion of the Koprulu Sector. This event is dated to the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date**: The war concludes with the permanent defeat of Amon. This climactic event occurs in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void,\" where a united force of Terran, Zerg, and Protoss venture into the Void to destroy Amon's consciousness. This final battle and the end of the war are dated to the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration**:\n    *   The war starts at some point in the year **2504**.\n    *   The war continues through the entirety of the year **2505** (the events of *Heart of the Swarm*).\n    *   The war ends at some point in the year **2506**.\n    *   Therefore, the conflict spans across three calendar years. The exact duration would be more than two full years but not more than three. For instance, if the war began in mid-2504 and ended late-2506, the duration would be approximately 2.5 years.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule**: The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**. Since the calculated duration is a value greater than 2 years (e.g., ~2.5 years), we must round this figure up to the next whole number.\n\n    *   Calculated duration > 2.0 years.\n    *   Rounding up any number between 2.0 (exclusive) and 3.0 (inclusive) results in **3**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Timeline Specificity**: StarCraft lore provides years for major events but rarely gives specific months or days. The calculation relies on the starting and ending years of the conflict.\n*   **Definition of the War's End**: The end of the war is marked by the defeat of the main architect, Amon. While skirmishes and instability may have continued afterward, the central, galactic-scale conflict known as the Second Great War concluded in 2506.\n*   **Rounding Direction is Crucial**: The instruction is to \"round up,\" not to \"round to the nearest year.\" If the duration were, for example, 2 years and 1 month (~2.1 years), rounding to the nearest year would be 2, but rounding *up* is 3. Given the war spans parts of three distinct years, the duration must be greater than 2 years, thus rounding up will always yield 3.\n\nFollowing this step-by-step analysis, we can confidently determine the final answer.\n\n<<<3>>>"
