    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and Edge Squares\n*   A standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid, totaling 64 squares.\n*   The \"edge squares\" are those on the perimeter of the board.\n*   We can count them: 8 squares on the top row, 8 on the bottom, and 6 on each side column (as the corners are already counted with the rows).\n*   Total edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Movement and Attack\n*   Bishops move and attack along diagonals.\n*   A crucial property of bishops is that they always remain on squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only ever attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack pieces on black squares.\n*   This means we can treat the problem as two independent sub-problems: one for white squares and one for black squares.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Edge Squares by Color\n*   Of the 28 edge squares, half are white and half are black.\n*   Total white edge squares = 14.\n*   Total black edge squares = 14.\n*   The goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on these 14 white squares, and then do the same for the 14 black squares.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares\n*   We need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 available white edge squares.\n*   Let's consider placing bishops on the white squares of the two opposite edge columns, column 'a' and column 'h'.\n    *   White squares in column 'a': a2, a4, a6, a8.\n    *   White squares in column 'h': h1, h3, h5, h7.\n*   Bishops within the same column cannot attack each other. So, we must check if any bishop in column 'a' attacks a bishop in column 'h'.\n*   The bishop on `a8` attacks along the diagonal a8-h1. The bishop on `h1` also occupies this diagonal. Therefore, we can only place one bishop on this pair of squares, not both.\n*   The other pairs (e.g., a2 and h7, a4 and h5, a6 and h3) do not attack each other.\n*   To maximize the number of bishops, we can place them on all the white squares in columns 'a' and 'h' except for one from the attacking pair (a8, h1). Let's remove the bishop from h1.\n*   This gives us a set of bishops on {a2, a4, a6, a8, h3, h5, h7}.\n*   This is a total of 7 non-attacking bishops on white edge squares. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible number for the white squares.\n\n### Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares\n*   The situation for the 14 black edge squares is perfectly symmetrical.\n*   We can use the same logic with the black squares on columns 'a' and 'h'.\n    *   Black squares in column 'a': a1, a3, a5, a7.\n    *   Black squares in column 'h': h2, h4, h6, h8.\n*   Let's check for attacks. The bishop on `a1` attacks along the main diagonal a1-h8. The bishop on `h8` is on that same diagonal. So, we can only place one bishop on the pair {a1, h8}.\n*   To maximize, we place bishops on all these black squares except one from the attacking pair. Let's remove the bishop from h8.\n*   This gives us a set of bishops on {a1, a3, a5, a7, h2, h4, h6}.\n*   This is a total of 7 non-attacking bishops on black edge squares, which is the maximum possible.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer\n*   Total maximum bishops placed on edge squares = (Max on white squares) + (Max on black squares).\n*   Total maximum bishops = 7 + 7 = 14.\n*   The question asks how many edge squares would *lack* bishops.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = (Total edge squares) - (Total bishops placed).\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
