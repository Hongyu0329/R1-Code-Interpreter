    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (\"Perfect Imperfection\") by Jacek Dukaj centers around Adam Zamoyski. He is a man from our contemporary times (the early 21st century) who is resurrected in a vastly different, far-future, post-human civilization.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character's primary romantic interest.**\nThroughout his journey of adaptation and survival in this new world, Adam Zamoyski forms a deep and central relationship with a female character. This character is an \"Incarnated\" (inkarnatka), a being native to the advanced virtual reality of this future civilization.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the marriage and identify the character's name.**\nA key plot point in the novel is the formal union or marriage between the protagonist, Adam Zamoyski, and this character. Her name is Angelica. Their marriage is both a personal, emotional development for Adam and a significant event with social and political implications within the story's universe.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Protagonist:** It's important to correctly identify the protagonist as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   **Context of the Marriage:** This isn't a traditional marriage. It takes place in a highly advanced, post-human setting, and Angelica herself is not a standard human but an Incarnated, which adds layers of complexity to their relationship.\n*   **Character Name:** The specific name requested is Angelica.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the plot of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries a character named Angelica.\n\n<<<Angelica>>>"
