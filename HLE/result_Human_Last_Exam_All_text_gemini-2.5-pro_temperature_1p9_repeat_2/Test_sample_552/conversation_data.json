    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific document in question.**\nThe question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The official title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the nature of scientific citation in that era.**\nUnlike modern research papers that are filled with dozens of references, scientific papers from the early 20th century, especially those by Einstein, were often characterized by a sparse citation list. Einstein was known for building arguments from fundamental principles rather than relying heavily on the contemporary literature.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the content of the paper for references.**\nA close reading of the introductory section (§1) of the paper is required to find any acknowledgments. In this section, Einstein sets up his argument. He discusses the concept of osmotic pressure as it applies to a solution of suspended particles.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific mention of lectures.**\nWhen outlining his method, Einstein explicitly states that his approach is not entirely novel in its conceptual foundation. He acknowledges a predecessor whose reasoning is similar. The key passage states that the essential arguments he is about to present are contained in a written work by a specific scientist, and *also* in a lecture given by that same person.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the scientist being cited.**\nThe scientist Einstein credits for this line of reasoning is the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. Einstein notes that his own method for relating the diffusion of particles to osmotic pressure is analogous to a method Boltzmann had previously used in the context of his kinetic theory of gases, which Boltzmann had presented in his published work and his lectures.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **The question is specific:** It asks about \"lectures,\" not just any citation. While Einstein also references a written work by Boltzmann, the explicit mention of his lectures is crucial.\n*   **Avoid common traps:** Other names are famously associated with Brownian motion. Robert Brown first observed the phenomenon, and Marian Smoluchowski independently developed a similar mathematical theory. However, neither of their lectures are cited in Einstein's paper.\n*   **Context of the citation:** Einstein's citation wasn't for the theory of Brownian motion itself, but for the specific conceptual method of linking the kinetic behavior of many particles (in this case, suspended in a fluid) to a macroscopic thermodynamic property (osmotic pressure).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the introductory section of Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, we find a direct reference to the work and the lectures of Ludwig Boltzmann as containing the essential ideas behind the method Einstein employed.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
