The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on x, denoted by $\xi(t,x,u)$, depends on the value of the parameter $k_1$:
1.  If $k_1 \neq 0$, the equation is nonlinear, and the form of $\xi$ is restricted to a constant, representing spatial translations:
    $\xi(t,x,u) = c$
    where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.

2.  If $k_1 = 0$, the equation is linear, and it admits a larger symmetry group. The general form of $\xi$ is a linear function of $x$ with coefficients that are linear in $t$:
    $\xi(t,x,u) = (\alpha t + \beta)x + (\gamma t + \delta)$
    where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ are arbitrary constants.
