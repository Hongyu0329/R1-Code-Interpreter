    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Defining the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the two-point Green's function for a system of fermions (e.g., electrons) in the Feynman path integral formalism. The Green's function $G(x_1, t_1; x_2, t_2)$ represents the amplitude for a particle to propagate from spacetime point $(x_2, t_2)$ to $(x_1, t_1)$. It is defined as a time-ordered correlation function:\n\n$G(x_1, t_1; x_2, t_2) = -i \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\ \\psi(x_1, t_1) \\psi^*(x_2, t_2) \\ e^{iS[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\ e^{iS[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}$\n\nwhere $\\psi(x,t)$ and $\\psi^*(x,t)$ are Grassmann fields representing the fermions, and $S[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ is the action of the system.\n\nThe term **\"bare\"** Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, refers to the Green's function of a **non-interacting** system. This means we use the non-interacting action, $S_0$, in the formula above.\n\n**Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action and Single-Particle Energies ($\\epsilon_k$)**\n\nThe non-interacting action $S_0$ is derived from the single-particle Hamiltonian, $\\hat{h}_0$. This Hamiltonian describes the system without any particle-particle interactions. For example, for free electrons, $\\hat{h}_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 \\nabla^2}{2m}$.\n\nThe single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are defined by the time-independent Schrödinger equation for $\\hat{h}_0$:\n$\\hat{h}_0 \\phi_k(x) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(x)$\nHere, $\\phi_k(x)$ are the energy eigenfunctions corresponding to the eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. The label $k$ represents the set of quantum numbers (e.g., momentum) that specifies the single-particle state.\n\nThe non-interacting action $S_0$ can be written in terms of the operator $\\hat{h}_0$:\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\ \\psi^*(x,t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{h}_0 \\right) \\psi(x,t)$\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalizing the Action in the Energy Eigenbasis**\n\nThe path integral is most easily solved when the action is diagonal. We can achieve this by changing the basis from position space ($x$) to the basis of energy eigenstates labeled by $k$. We expand the field $\\psi(x,t)$ in terms of the eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$:\n$\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_k c_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\nwhere $c_k(t)$ are now Grassmann-valued functions of time only.\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions ($\\int \\phi_k^*(x) \\phi_{k'}(x) d^dx = \\delta_{kk'}$), the action separates into a sum of independent terms, one for each mode $k$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\ c_k^*(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(t)$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** This diagonalization is a crucial step. It shows that in a non-interacting system, the propagation of a particle in a state $k$ is completely independent of all other states $k'$.\n\n**Step 4: Fourier Transformation to Frequency-Momentum Space**\n\nThe action is simplified further by performing a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$). Let\n$c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} c_k(\\omega) e^{-i\\omega t}$\n\nSubstituting this into the action for mode $k$ and integrating over time, the time derivative $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes a simple multiplication by $\\hbar\\omega$. The action becomes algebraic:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} c_k^*(\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 5: Deriving the Green's Function**\n\nThe Green's function in the $(k, \\omega)$ representation, denoted $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the correlator $\\langle c_k(\\omega) c_k^*(\\omega) \\rangle$. For a quadratic action of the form $S = \\int \\phi^* A \\phi$, the propagator (or Green's function) is given by the inverse of the operator $A$.\n\nIn our case, the operator for each mode $k$ is $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Therefore, the bare Green's function for the mode $k$ is the inverse of this expression:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** To handle the singularity (pole) at $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, a small imaginary part, $i\\eta$, must be added to the denominator. The sign of this term is determined by the specific boundary conditions and time-ordering prescription (Feynman, retarded, or advanced). For the Feynman propagator, the prescription is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential (or Fermi energy). Often, $\\epsilon_k$ is measured relative to $\\mu$, and $\\hbar$ is set to 1 for simplicity, leading to the common form:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$ (where the sign of $\\eta$ can depend on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied in the ground state).\n\n### Summary of Functional Dependence\n\nThe analysis reveals that the bare Green's function $G_0$, when expressed in the basis of energy eigenstates (the momentum-frequency representation), has a very specific functional form.\n\n1.  **Inverse Proportionality**: $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (energy) variable $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Poles at Eigenenergies**: The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane are located exactly at the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. This is the most profound physical consequence of the functional dependence: the energies of the non-interacting particles are precisely the locations where the particle propagator diverges.\n3.  **Time Evolution**: In the time domain, this dependence translates to an oscillatory behavior governed by the energy eigenvalue. The propagation amplitude for a particle in state $k$ evolves in time with a phase factor $e^{-i\\epsilon_k t / \\hbar}$.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is captured by the expression:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nwhere $\\delta$ is an appropriate infinitesimal imaginary number.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function in the momentum-frequency representation, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ as an inverse function. Specifically, it is proportional to $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, where $\\hbar\\omega$ is the energy variable. The expression is given by $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$, where $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that handles the pole. This means the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane are located at the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
