    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the First Clue**\nThe first part of the question provides two quotes from the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky: \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n*   **Careful Point:** The key is to identify which work of Voznesensky these quotes come from and who the subject of that work is.\n*   **Analysis:** These lines are from Voznesensky's 1957 poem \"Saga\" (Сага). This poem later formed the literary basis for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (Юнона и Авось).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Subject of the Poem**\nThe poem \"Saga\" is dedicated to a specific historical figure.\n*   **Careful Point:** The man described as a \"joy-discovering sailor\" is the hero of the poem and the rock opera.\n*   **Analysis:** The central figure of \"Saga\" and \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764–1807). He was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and undertook a famous diplomatic and trade mission that took him to Spanish California. This historical context perfectly fits the description of a \"sailor.\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Clue About the Grave's Location**\nThe poem's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\", explicitly states that when the poem was written, the location of Rezanov's grave was unknown.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must verify this with historical facts about Nikolai Rezanov.\n*   **Analysis:** Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807, while on his way back to St. Petersburg. He was buried in the cemetery of the Resurrection Cathedral there. However, during the Soviet era, the cathedral and its cemetery were demolished, and the exact location of his grave was lost for many decades. This confirms that the premise of the poem's question was factually correct.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Final Clue About the Grave's Discovery**\nThe question states, \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" This implies the grave was found or its location was identified during this period.\n*   **Careful Point:** This final piece of information must match the historical timeline of Rezanov's grave.\n*   **Analysis:** Fueled by the popularity of the rock opera, renewed interest in Rezanov's fate led to searches for his grave in Krasnoyarsk. In the late 1980s, historians and archaeologists identified a probable location for his remains at the Trinity (Troitskoye) cemetery, where some graves from the demolished cathedral had been reinterred. In 1989, a cross was erected, which was later replaced by a prominent monument. This rediscovery and official commemoration in the late 1980s directly answers Voznesensky's poetic question.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\nAll the provided clues converge on a single individual:\n1.  The quotes are from Voznesensky's poem about him.\n2.  His profession fits the \"sailor\" description.\n3.  His grave was indeed lost.\n4.  His grave's presumed location was found and commemorated in the late 1980s.\nThe man in question is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
