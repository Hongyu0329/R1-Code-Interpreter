    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph Structure\n\nThe problem specifies a barbell graph with 10 nodes. A standard barbell graph is constructed from two identical complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge (a bridge).\n\n*   **Total Nodes (n):** 10\n*   **Structure:** Two cliques of size `k` connected by one edge.\n*   The total number of nodes is `2k`. Therefore, `2k = 10`, which means each clique has `k = 5` nodes.\n*   So, the graph consists of two `K_5` (complete graphs on 5 vertices) and one \"bottleneck\" edge connecting a single vertex from one `K_5` to a single vertex from the other `K_5`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Total Number of Edges\n\nTo find the probability of sampling a specific edge, we first need to know the total number of edges (`|E|`) in the graph. The total number of edges is the sum of the edges in the two cliques plus the connecting bottleneck edge.\n\n*   **Edges in one Kâ‚… clique:** A complete graph with `k` nodes has `k * (k-1) / 2` edges. For `k=5`, the number of edges is `5 * (5-1) / 2 = 5 * 4 / 2 = 10`.\n*   **Edges in both cliques:** Since there are two `K_5` cliques, the total number of edges within them is `10 + 10 = 20`.\n*   **The Bottleneck Edge:** There is exactly one edge connecting the two cliques.\n*   **Total Edges (`|E|`):** The total number of edges is the sum of edges in the cliques and the bottleneck edge: `|E| = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21`.\n\n### Step 3: Interpreting the Sampling Process\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in \"randomized uniform gossiping\".\n\n*   **Uniform Gossiping Model:** The most standard interpretation for this process, especially when phrased as \"sampling an edge\", is that at each step, one edge from the entire set of edges `E` is selected uniformly at random.\n*   **Uniform Weights:** The problem states the graph has \"uniform weights\". This reinforces the idea that each edge is treated equally, having a weight of 1. In a weighted graph, an edge `e` would be sampled with probability proportional to its weight `w(e)`. Since all weights are uniform (e.g., `w(e) = 1` for all `e`), each edge has the same probability of being chosen.\n*   **Probability of Sampling any single edge:** The probability of selecting any specific edge `e` is `P(e) = 1 / |E|`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Final Probability\n\nNow we can combine the previous steps to find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge.\n\n*   **Event of Interest:** Sampling the single bottleneck edge.\n*   **Number of Favorable Outcomes:** There is only 1 bottleneck edge in the graph.\n*   **Total Number of Possible Outcomes:** There are `|E| = 21` edges in total to sample from.\n*   **Probability:** The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.\n    Probability = (Number of bottleneck edges) / (Total number of edges) = `1 / 21`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Graph Definition:** It's crucial to correctly identify the structure of a 10-node barbell graph as two `K_5` cliques joined by a single edge. Any other interpretation (e.g., a path of length > 1) would change the total node count or edge count.\n2.  **Gossiping Model:** The interpretation of \"randomized uniform gossiping\" is key. The edge-centric model (selecting an edge uniformly from `E`) is the most direct fit for the question's wording. An alternative node-centric model (select a node `u` uniformly, then a neighbor `v` uniformly) would yield a different result (`1/25` in this case), but is less likely to be the intended meaning for \"uniform gossiping\" in this context. Our chosen interpretation aligns with the standard analysis of gossip algorithms on graphs.\n3.  **Calculation:** The calculation of the number of edges in a complete graph (`k(k-1)/2`) must be accurate. For `k=5`, this is `10`. Summing these for both cliques and adding the single bridge edge gives the correct total of `21`.\n\nThe final probability is the reciprocal of the total number of edges in the graph.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
