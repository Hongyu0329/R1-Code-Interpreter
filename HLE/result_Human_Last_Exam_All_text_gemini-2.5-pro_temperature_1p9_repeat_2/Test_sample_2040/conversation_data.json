    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\n\n*   **Definition:** SPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In this process, a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) passes through a suitable nonlinear optical medium and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons).\n*   **Governing Principles:** The process must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The energy of the pump photon equals the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons ($\\omega_{pump} = \\omega_{signal} + \\omega_{idler}$).\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:** The momentum of the pump photon equals the sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons ($\\vec{k}_{pump} = \\vec{k}_{signal} + \\vec{k}_{idler}$). This is also known as the phase-matching condition.\n*   **Material Requirement:** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process. Its efficiency is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$. For SPDC to occur with any significant efficiency, the material must have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Material Property for a Non-Zero $\\chi^{(2)}$**\n\n*   **Symmetry Rule:** A fundamental principle in nonlinear optics dictates the relationship between a material's crystal structure and its nonlinear properties. For the second-order susceptibility tensor ($\\chi^{(2)}$) to be non-zero in the bulk electric dipole approximation (which is the dominant mechanism), the material's crystal lattice must **lack a center of inversion symmetry**. Such materials are called non-centrosymmetric.\n*   **Centrosymmetric Materials:** If a material has a center of inversion (i.e., it is centrosymmetric), then for every atom at a position `(x, y, z)` relative to the inversion center, there is an identical atom at `(-x, -y, -z)`. In such materials, applying an electric field `E` and its opposite `-E` produces an equivalent polarization response, which mathematically forces all even-order susceptibility tensors, including $\\chi^{(2)}$, to be zero.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\n*   **Material in Question:** We are asked about free-standing boron nanosheets, a 2D material also known as borophene.\n*   **Allotropes and Structure:** Borophene can exist in several structural phases (allotropes). The most commonly synthesized and theoretically studied phases on silver substrates are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_{3}$ phases.\n*   **Symmetry of Borophene:** Detailed crystallographic analysis of these common borophene phases shows that they possess **inversion symmetry**.\n    *   The $\\beta_{12}$ phase belongs to the space group *Pmmn*.\n    *   The $\\chi_{3}$ phase belongs to the space group *Cmcm*.\n    *   Both of these space groups are **centrosymmetric**.\n*   **Effect of \"Buckling\":** Borophene sheets are not perfectly flat; they are \"buckled,\" with atoms existing at slightly different heights. However, this buckling is periodic and symmetric in such a way that the overall unit cell of the crystal still maintains a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Material Property with the Requirement for SPDC**\n\n*   SPDC requires a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n*   A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n*   The stable, common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because the crystal structure of boron nanosheets has inversion symmetry, its bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$, is zero.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Main Conclusion:** Since $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion via the dominant electric-dipole interaction. The answer to the question is **no**.\n*   **Careful Points and Nuances:**\n    1.  **Comparison to Other 2D Materials:** This behavior contrasts sharply with other 2D materials like monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS₂, WSe₂) or hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). These materials naturally lack inversion symmetry, have a large non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$, and are thus excellent candidates for second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC. Graphene, like borophene, is also centrosymmetric and has a zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n    2.  **Edge and Defect Effects:** In a real-world sample, symmetry can be locally broken at the edges of the nanosheet or at defect sites. This could, in principle, lead to a very weak, localized $\\chi^{(2)}$ response, but it would not be a characteristic property of the material itself and would be extremely inefficient.\n    3.  **Higher-Order Effects:** Even in centrosymmetric media, extremely weak second-order effects can sometimes be observed due to electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole contributions. However, these are typically many orders of magnitude weaker than the electric dipole effects seen in non-centrosymmetric materials. Therefore, one would not \"expect\" to see SPDC in a practical sense.\n    4.  **External Fields/Strain:** Applying a strong external DC electric field or introducing a specific strain gradient can artificially break the inversion symmetry and induce a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$. However, the question specifies a \"free-standing\" sheet \"excited by incident light,\" implying no such external symmetry-breaking fields are present.\n\nBased on the intrinsic properties of the material's crystal structure, the primary requirement for SPDC is not met.\n\n***\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The reason is that this nonlinear optical process requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$), which is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, meaning their $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, thus forbidding this process.>>>"
