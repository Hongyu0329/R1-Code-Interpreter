No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The reason is that this nonlinear optical process requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$), which is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, meaning their $\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, thus forbidding this process.
