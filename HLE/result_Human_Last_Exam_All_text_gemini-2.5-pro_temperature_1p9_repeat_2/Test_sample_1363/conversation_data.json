    "Step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the dance where the technical rules are so strict and specific that \"overturning\" a \"reverse turn\" is not possible.\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** This is a standard figure in ballroom dancing, involving a turn to the left.\n    *   **Overturning:** This means turning more than the standard amount prescribed for the figure. For example, if a figure normally turns 3/4, an overturned version might turn 7/8 or a full 1/1 rotation.\n    *   **Without Disregarding the Technique:** This is the most crucial part. It means that while adhering strictly to the fundamental principles (like posture, hold, footwork, timing, character, etc.) of the specific dance, the extra rotation cannot be achieved.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Dance Choices and their Techniques:** The choices are the five International Standard dances. Let's analyze the Reverse Turn in each.\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is characterized by continuous rotation. While there are standard amounts of turn for the Reverse Turn, controlling the rotation to turn slightly more or less is fundamental to navigating the dance floor. The technique (using swing, sway, and body rotation) allows for this variability. Thus, overturning is possible.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot & E. Quickstep:** These three are often called the \"swing\" dances. Their technique is built upon creating momentum through the body, using elements like Contra Body Movement (CBM), swing, sway, and rise and fall.\n        *   In a **Waltz** Reverse Turn, a dancer can use more body rotation, a stronger CBM, and more dynamic sway to generate extra turn. Overturning the turn, especially at a corner, is a common and acceptable variation in advanced choreography.\n        *   In **Slow Foxtrot** and **Quickstep**, the same principles of swing apply. The Reverse Turn can be modified and overturned to create different choreographic effects. The techniques are robust enough to allow this extra rotation without being \"broken.\"\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The technique of Tango is fundamentally different from the other four dances.\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** Tango is danced on a level plane with bent knees.\n        *   **No Sway:** The body does not sway from side to side.\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, clipped, and deliberate, not flowing or continuous. There is no \"swing\" in the feet or legs; they are picked up and placed.\n        *   **The Turn Mechanism:** A Tango Reverse Turn is not executed with a swinging momentum. It's more akin to a controlled, sharp swivel or pivot. The turn is achieved by precisely placing the feet and turning the body over the standing foot in a series of distinct actions (often with a \"Quick, Quick, Slow\" timing).\n        *   **Impossibility of Overturning:** Because Tango technique forbids the very elements used to generate extra rotation in the other dances (swing, momentum from rise/fall, sway), there is no technical mechanism to overturn the turn. Attempting to force more rotation would require a dancer to lift the heel when it should be down, introduce a swinging action, or create rise/fallâ€”all of which are direct violations of fundamental Tango technique. The compact, grounded, and staccato nature of the figure makes it technically impossible to add rotation beyond its design without completely abandoning the character and rules of the dance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep, Viennese Waltz) have technical principles that allow for the overturning of a Reverse Turn as a variation. In contrast, the European Tango's core technique (no rise, no fall, no sway, no swing, staccato action) is so restrictive that overturning a Reverse Turn cannot be done without disregarding these foundational rules.\n\n<<<C>>>"
