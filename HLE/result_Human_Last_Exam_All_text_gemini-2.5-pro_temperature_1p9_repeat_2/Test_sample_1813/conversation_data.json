    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\)**\n\nThe generalized Markov numbers, \\(m_{p/q}\\), are rational numbers associated with a rational number \\(p/q\\). There are several definitions in the mathematical literature depending on the context (e.g., cluster algebras, quadratic forms, Diophantine approximation). We will use a definition based on continuants, which is well-suited for direct computation from the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\).\n\nLet the simple continued fraction of a rational number \\( p/q \\) (with \\(0 < p < q\\) and \\(\\gcd(p,q)=1\\)) be \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] \\). The denominator \\(q\\) can be expressed using a continuant polynomial \\(q = K(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)\\).\n\nA definition for the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) given by C. Levesque, related to the work of T. W. Cusick and B. D. TakaÂ´cs, is:\n\\( m_{p/q} = \\frac{K(a_1, \\ldots, a_n, a_n, \\ldots, a_1)}{q \\cdot K(a_n, \\ldots, a_2)} \\)\n\nThis formula allows us to compute the numerical value of \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the continued fraction of 4/7**\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of the continued fraction for 4/7.\n1.  \\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} \\)\n2.  \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n3.  \\( \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4/3} \\)\n4.  \\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\nCombining these steps, we get:\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\)\nSo, the continued fraction for 4/7 is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). The coefficients are \\( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 3 \\). The denominator is \\( q=7 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Compute the continuant terms in the formula for \\( m_{4/7} \\)**\n\nThe formula requires computing two continuants. The continuant \\(K(x_1, \\dots, x_k)\\) can be computed using the recurrence relation:\n\\( K_0 = 1 \\)\n\\( K_1 = x_1 \\)\n\\( K_i = x_i K_{i-1} + K_{i-2} \\) for \\( i \\geq 2 \\).\n\n*   **Denominator Term:** We need \\( q \\cdot K(a_3, a_2) = 7 \\cdot K(3, 1) \\).\n    To compute \\( K(3, 1) \\):\n    \\( K_0 = 1 \\)\n    \\( K_1 = 3 \\)\n    \\( K_2 = 1 \\cdot K_1 + K_0 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 4 \\).\n    So, \\( K(3, 1) = 4 \\).\n    The denominator is \\( 7 \\cdot 4 = 28 \\).\n\n*   **Numerator Term:** We need \\( K(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_3, a_2, a_1) = K(1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n    Let the sequence of coefficients be \\( (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6) = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n    \\( K_0 = 1 \\)\n    \\( K_1 = x_1 = 1 \\)\n    \\( K_2 = x_2 K_1 + K_0 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 2 \\)\n    \\( K_3 = x_3 K_2 + K_1 = 3 \\cdot 2 + 1 = 7 \\)\n    \\( K_4 = x_4 K_3 + K_2 = 3 \\cdot 7 + 2 = 23 \\)\n    \\( K_5 = x_5 K_4 + K_3 = 1 \\cdot 23 + 7 = 30 \\)\n    \\( K_6 = x_6 K_5 + K_4 = 1 \\cdot 30 + 23 = 53 \\)\n    The numerator is 53.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the value of \\( m_{4/7} \\)**\n\nUsing the values computed in Step 3:\n\\( m_{4/7} = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{53}{28} \\)\n\n**Step 5: Compute the continued fraction of the resulting number \\( m_{4/7} = 53/28 \\)**\n\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with\" \\( m_{4/7} \\). The most direct interpretation is to compute the simple continued fraction of the number \\( m_{4/7} \\) itself. We use the Euclidean algorithm again:\n1.  \\( 53 = 1 \\cdot 28 + 25 \\implies \\frac{53}{28} = 1 + \\frac{25}{28} \\)\n2.  \\( 28 = 1 \\cdot 25 + 3 \\implies \\frac{28}{25} = 1 + \\frac{3}{25} \\)\n3.  \\( 25 = 8 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\implies \\frac{25}{3} = 8 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n4.  \\( 3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\implies \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\)\n\nFrom this, we construct the continued fraction:\n\\( \\frac{53}{28} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{8 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\)\nThe continued fraction for \\( 53/28 \\) is \\( [1; 1, 8, 3] \\).\n\nThis is the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)."
