    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the candidates:** The noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is excluded from consideration.\n\n2.  **Understand the metric:** The question asks for the rarest gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we must consider the total amount of each gas in the Earth's atmosphere, crust, mantle, and hydrosphere combined, not just its concentration in the air.\n\n3.  **Analyze the abundance of stable noble gases:**\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** This is by far the most abundant noble gas on Earth. Its primary isotope, Argon-40, is continuously produced by the radioactive decay of Potassium-40 in the Earth's crust and mantle. It makes up about 0.93% of the atmosphere.\n    *   **Helium (He):** While extremely rare in the atmosphere because it's light enough to escape Earth's gravity, it is also continuously produced by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. It is the second most abundant noble gas overall when these terrestrial reserves are included.\n    *   **Neon (Ne), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe):** These gases are primarily found in the atmosphere and are considered \"primordial,\" meaning they have been present since the Earth's formation. Their atmospheric abundances (by volume) are roughly: Neon (18 ppm), Krypton (1.1 ppm), and Xenon (0.09 ppm). Of these three, Xenon is the rarest.\n\n4.  **Analyze Radon (Rn):** This is the most critical point. Radon is different from the others because all of its isotopes are highly radioactive.\n    *   The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only about 3.8 days.\n    *   It is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of radium (which is part of the decay chain of uranium).\n    *   Because it decays so quickly, it cannot accumulate in significant quantities. At any given moment, the total mass of Radon on the entire planet (in the ground, water, and air) is exceptionally small. Estimates place the total amount in the atmosphere at less than 100 kg, and the total on the planet is minuscule compared to other elements.\n\n5.  **Compare the rarest candidates:** The primary comparison is between Xenon (the rarest stable noble gas) and Radon.\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** As a stable gas, its quantity on Earth is the total amount that has been retained over geological time. The mass of Xenon in the atmosphere alone is estimated to be over a trillion kilograms (10^12 kg).\n    *   **Radon (Rn):** Due to its extremely short half-life, its total steady-state mass on the entire planet at any given time is estimated to be in the tens of kilograms.\n    *   Therefore, the total amount of Radon is many orders of magnitude less than the total amount of Xenon.\n\n6.  **Consider the date (2002):** The relative abundances of these elements and their fundamental properties (like half-life) do not change on human timescales. The ranking of abundance was the same in 2002 as it is today.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDespite being continuously produced, Radon's extremely rapid radioactive decay prevents it from accumulating. This makes its total instantaneous quantity on Earth incredibly small, far smaller than that of the rarest stable noble gas, Xenon. Therefore, Radon is the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
