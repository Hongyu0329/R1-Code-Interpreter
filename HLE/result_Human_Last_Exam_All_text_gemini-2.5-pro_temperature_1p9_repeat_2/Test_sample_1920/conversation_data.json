    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Trying small prime divisors:\n    *   $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n    *   $7657 = 13 \\times 589$\n    *   $589 = 19 \\times 31$\n*   So, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n*   **Careful point:** The conductor $d$ is a square-free integer (a product of distinct primes).\n\n**Step 2: Understand Primitive Characters for a Square-Free Conductor**\n\nFor a square-free conductor $d$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character. The principal character is the one that has $\\chi(n) = 1$ for all $n$ with $\\gcd(n,d)=1$ and has order 1. We are looking for characters of order 6, so their order is not 1. Therefore, any character of order 6 with conductor $d=53599$ will be primitive. The problem is reduced to finding the total number of Dirichlet characters of order 6 modulo 53599.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the Character Group**\n\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is isomorphic to the direct product of the groups of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\cong \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/31\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$\n\nA character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where each $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo $p$.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the Order of $\\chi$ to its Components**\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$\n\nWe need this order to be 6.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Component Character Groups**\n\nFor a prime $p$, the group of characters modulo $p$, $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$, is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n*   The group of characters mod 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n*   The group of characters mod 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n*   The group of characters mod 19 is cyclic of order $\\phi(19) = 18$.\n*   The group of characters mod 31 is cyclic of order $\\phi(31) = 30$.\n\n**Step 6: Count the Characters Using Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nLet's find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6.\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain an order that is a multiple of 2, and an order that is a multiple of 3.\n\nWe use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Let $G_p = \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$. We are counting elements $(g_7, g_{13}, g_{19}, g_{31})$ in $G_7 \\times G_{13} \\times G_{19} \\times G_{31}$ with order 6.\n\n*   Let $N(k)$ be the number of characters $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$ where the order of $\\chi$ divides $k$. This means the order of each $\\chi_p$ must divide $k$.\n*   The number of elements in a cyclic group of order $m$ whose order divides $k$ is $\\gcd(k, m)$.\n*   $N(k) = (\\text{Num. choices for } \\chi_7) \\times (\\text{Num. choices for } \\chi_{13}) \\times (\\text{Num. choices for } \\chi_{19}) \\times (\\text{Num. choices for } \\chi_{31})$\n    $N(k) = \\gcd(k, \\phi(7)) \\times \\gcd(k, \\phi(13)) \\times \\gcd(k, \\phi(19)) \\times \\gcd(k, \\phi(31))$\n    $N(k) = \\gcd(k, 6) \\times \\gcd(k, 12) \\times \\gcd(k, 18) \\times \\gcd(k, 30)$\n\nNow, let's calculate $N(k)$ for the divisors of 6 (which are 1, 2, 3, 6):\n\n*   **Number of characters whose order divides 6 ($N(6)$):**\n    $N(6) = \\gcd(6, 6) \\times \\gcd(6, 12) \\times \\gcd(6, 18) \\times \\gcd(6, 30) = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 1296$.\n\n*   **Number of characters whose order divides 3 ($N(3)$):**\n    These are the characters where the lcm of orders is not a multiple of 2.\n    $N(3) = \\gcd(3, 6) \\times \\gcd(3, 12) \\times \\gcd(3, 18) \\times \\gcd(3, 30) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 81$.\n\n*   **Number of characters whose order divides 2 ($N(2)$):**\n    These are the characters where the lcm of orders is not a multiple of 3.\n    $N(2) = \\gcd(2, 6) \\times \\gcd(2, 12) \\times \\gcd(2, 18) \\times \\gcd(2, 30) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n*   **Number of characters whose order divides 1 ($N(1)$):**\n    These are the characters where the lcm of orders divides both 2 and 3. This means the order is 1 (the principal character).\n    $N(1) = \\gcd(1, 6) \\times \\gcd(1, 12) \\times \\gcd(1, 18) \\times \\gcd(1, 30) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe number of characters with order exactly 6 is given by the inclusion-exclusion formula:\nNumber of order 6 characters = $N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)$\nNumber = $1296 - 81 - 16 + 1$\nNumber = $1200$\n\nSince all characters of order 6 are primitive for the conductor $d=53599$, the number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order 6 is 1200.\n\n<<<1200>>>"
