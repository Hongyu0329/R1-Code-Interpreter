    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is the standard 2D square grid, also known as the square lattice (`Z^2`). Vertices are points with integer coordinates `(x, y)`. An edge connects two vertices if their Euclidean distance is 1. From any vertex, there are four possible moves: up, down, left, or right.\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of `n` moves (edges) starting from an initial vertex. A walk of `n` steps involves `n+1` vertices.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same vertex more than once.\n*   **a(n):** This represents the total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed origin, typically `(0,0)`. The total count is independent of the starting vertex due to the lattice's symmetry.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Lattice Type:** The result is specific to the square lattice. Different lattices (e.g., triangular, hexagonal) would yield different numbers.\n2.  **Starting Point:** We assume a fixed starting point. Counting walks that can start anywhere would involve multiplying by the (infinite) number of possible starting points. The problem context implies a fixed origin.\n3.  **Nature of the Problem:** There is no known simple closed-form formula to calculate `a(n)`. The value must be found either by direct enumeration for small `n`, or by using sophisticated computer algorithms and known results for larger `n`.\n4.  **Attrition:** The main difficulty in enumerating SAWs is that the number of possible next moves is not constant. As a walk progresses, it might \"trap\" itself, reducing the number of available non-revisiting moves. This is called attrition.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis and Enumeration for small n\n\nLet's compute the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` to understand the process.\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    Starting at (0,0), there are 4 possible moves: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1). All are 1-step long and self-avoiding.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    Take any of the 4 walks of length 1. For example, the walk to (1,0). From (1,0), there are 4 possible moves: (2,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,-1). The move back to (0,0) is forbidden as the walk must be self-avoiding. This leaves 3 valid moves. By symmetry, this applies to all 4 starting walks.\n    *   `a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    Consider a 2-step SAW, e.g., (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). From the endpoint (2,0), the next move must not be back to (1,0). Also, it cannot be to a previously visited point, i.e., (0,0). The neighbors of (2,0) are (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). The point (0,0) is not a neighbor of (2,0). So, there are 3 valid moves. This holds for any 2-step SAW: the endpoint `v_2` is never adjacent to the starting point `v_0`.\n    *   `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    This is where attrition begins. Consider a 3-step SAW: (0,0) -> `v_1` -> `v_2` -> `v_3`. We extend it to `v_4`. The move to `v_2` is forbidden. A problem occurs if a neighbor of `v_3` is `v_0` or `v_1`.\n    Let's analyze paths starting with (0,0)->(1,0).\n    There are `a(3)/4 = 9` such paths of length 3.\n    1.  Paths like (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0). The endpoint (3,0) is far from the origin. It has 3 valid extensions.\n    2.  Paths like (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1). The endpoint is (0,1). Its neighbors are (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), and (0,0). The walk has already visited (1,1) and (0,0). So, only 2 moves are allowed: to (-1,1) and (0,2).\n    By enumeration, we find that for each of the 4 initial directions, there are 2 such \"trapping\" paths of length 3. Total `4 * 2 = 8` trapping paths.\n    The remaining `a(3) - 8 = 36 - 8 = 28` paths have 3 extensions each.\n    The 8 trapping paths have 2 extensions each.\n    *   `a(4) = (28 * 3) + (8 * 2) = 84 + 16 = 100`\n\n### Step 4: Acquiring the Final Answer for a(10)\n\nAs `n` increases, this case-by-case analysis becomes combinatorially explosive. A direct manual calculation for `a(10)` is intractable. This problem is a classic in computational physics and combinatorics, and the sequence `a(n)` has been calculated to a high number of terms using powerful computer algorithms (like backtracking or transfer-matrix methods).\n\nThe sequence `a(n)` for `n=1, 2, ...` is a well-known sequence, listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001412. We can find the required term from this established sequence.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n*   `a(1) = 4`\n*   `a(2) = 12`\n*   `a(3) = 36`\n*   `a(4) = 100`\n*   `a(5) = 284`\n*   `a(6) = 780`\n*   `a(7) = 2172`\n*   `a(8) = 5916`\n*   `a(9) = 16268`\n*   **`a(10) = 44100`**\n\nBased on these extensively verified computational results, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
