    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the competitive programming problem to find the most memory-efficient C solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\n\nThe core task is to compare two strings of the same length lexicographically, ignoring case.\n- **Input:** Two strings, `s1` and `s2`. Lengths are equal, between 1 and 100. They contain only Latin letters.\n- **Comparison:** 'a' is equal to 'A'. The comparison is character by character from left to right.\n- **Output:**\n    - \"-1\" if `s1` comes before `s2`.\n    - \"1\" if `s1` comes after `s2`.\n    - \"0\" if they are equivalent.\n- **Constraint:** The solution must be the *most memory-efficient* C program. We need to calculate the total memory in bytes (`m`) used for the variables in this optimal program.\n\n### Step 2: High-Level Algorithm Design\n\nThe comparison must proceed character by character. For each position `i`, we compare the character `s1[i]` with `s2[i]`.\n1.  Take the character from `s1` at the current position.\n2.  Take the character from `s2` at the same position.\n3.  Convert both characters to a common case (e.g., lowercase) to ensure case-insensitivity. The `tolower()` function is ideal for this.\n4.  If the converted character from `s1` is less than the one from `s2`, we know `s1 < s2`. We can immediately print \"-1\" and stop.\n5.  If the converted character from `s1` is greater, we know `s1 > s2`. We print \"1\" and stop.\n6.  If they are equal, we move to the next position and repeat.\n7.  If we traverse the entire length of the strings without finding any difference, they are equal. We print \"0\".\n\n### Step 3: Memory Efficiency Analysis and Optimization\n\nTo find the *most* memory-efficient solution, we must minimize the amount of data we store in variables.\n\n- **Standard Approach:** A common way to solve this is to read both strings into two separate character arrays.\n    - `char s1[101];` (for up to 100 chars + `\\0` null terminator) -> 101 bytes.\n    - `char s2[101];` -> 101 bytes.\n    - An integer loop counter, e.g., `int i;` -> 4 bytes (on typical systems).\n    - Total: `101 + 101 + 4 = 206` bytes.\n\n- **Optimized Approach (The Most Memory-Efficient):** We can significantly reduce memory if we avoid storing the second string in a buffer. We only need to store the first string to have something to compare against. The second string can be read and compared one character at a time.\n\n    **The refined algorithm:**\n    1.  Declare a buffer only for the first string: `char s1[101];`.\n    2.  Read the first string from input into `s1` using `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`.\n    3.  Declare a loop counter variable. Since the length is at most 100, an `unsigned char` (1 byte, range 0-255) is sufficient, which is smaller than an `int`. Let's name it `i`.\n    4.  Declare a character variable to hold one character from the second string at a time: `char c2;` (1 byte).\n    5.  Loop from `i = 0` while `s1[i]` is not the null terminator.\n    6.  Inside the loop, read the next non-whitespace character from the input into `c2`. The `scanf(\" %c\", &c2);` format specifier is perfect for this. The leading space tells `scanf` to consume any whitespace (including spaces and newlines) before reading the character.\n    7.  Perform the case-insensitive comparison: `if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2))`, etc.\n    8.  If a difference is found, print the result and terminate.\n    9.  If the loop finishes, print \"0\".\n\n### Step 4: List Careful Points for Implementation\n\n1.  **Buffer Sizing:** String length is up to 100. A C string buffer needs space for the null terminator (`\\0`). Thus, the minimum required size is `100 + 1 = 101`.\n2.  **Variable Types:** Use the smallest possible data types for variables to minimize memory.\n    -   `unsigned char i;` for a loop counter up to 100.\n    -   `char c2;` to store a single character.\n3.  **Input Reading:** The `scanf(\" %c\", &c2)` trick is crucial for the memory-optimized version to correctly read the second string character-by-character while handling the newline character that follows the first string.\n4.  **Headers:** The program will need `<stdio.h>` for input/output and `<ctype.h>` for the `tolower()` function.\n5.  **Guarantees:** The problem guarantees the strings have the same length, which simplifies the logic. We don't need to handle cases where one string is a prefix of the other.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Acquisition (Calculating `m`)\n\nWe now calculate the total memory (`m`) used for variables in our most efficient C program.\n\n1.  Buffer for the first string: `char s1[101];`\n    -   Memory usage = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n2.  Loop counter: `unsigned char i;`\n    -   Memory usage = `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n3.  Variable for single character from second string: `char c2;`\n    -   Memory usage = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nm = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c2`)\nm = 101 + 1 + 1\nm = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
