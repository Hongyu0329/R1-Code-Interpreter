    "This question asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The dimension of a Lie group is equal to the dimension of its associated Lie algebra, which is the vector space of the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformations. We can find these generators by analyzing the transformations that leave the equations invariant.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations:**\n    The equations govern the evolution of a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and a pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in time $t$ and space $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$. For constant density (set to 1) and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, they are:\n    *   **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n    *   **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\n2.  **Identifying Symmetries:**\n    A symmetry is a transformation of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that maps any solution of the equations to another solution. We can identify the continuous symmetries (which form a Lie group) by considering their infinitesimal generators.\n\n3.  **Physical Invariances and their Generators:**\n    We can identify several symmetry groups based on the physical principles underlying the equations.\n\n    *   **Time Translation:** The equations are autonomous (coefficients are independent of time), so they are invariant under time shifts: $t \\to t + c$.\n        *   Number of generators: 1 (generator is $\\partial_t$).\n\n    *   **Spatial Translations:** The equations are homogeneous in space (coefficients are constant, and the domain is all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$), so they are invariant under spatial shifts: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$.\n        *   Number of generators: 3 (generators are $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$).\n\n    *   **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are isotropic (no preferred direction in space). They are invariant under rotations of the coordinate system, $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$ (where $R \\in SO(3)$), with pressure $p$ transforming as a scalar ($p \\to p$).\n        *   Number of generators: 3 (the dimension of the rotation group $SO(3)$).\n\n    *   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are based on Galilean relativity. They are invariant when transforming to an inertial frame moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$. The transformation is: $t \\to t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$.\n        *   Number of generators: 3 (one for a boost in each spatial direction).\n\n    *   **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations possess a specific scaling symmetry. If $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, then so is the scaled field $(\\mathbf{u}'(t', \\mathbf{x}'), p'(t', \\mathbf{x}'))$ defined by:\n        $t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$\n        for any scaling factor $\\lambda > 0$. This constitutes a one-parameter group of symmetries.\n        *   Number of generators: 1.\n\n4.  **Careful Point: The Pressure Gauge Symmetry:**\n    In the momentum equation, the pressure term appears as a gradient, $\\nabla p$. This implies that the equations are invariant under the transformation $p \\to p + f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is an arbitrary function of time, because $\\nabla(p + f(t)) = \\nabla p$. This introduces an infinite-dimensional abelian subalgebra of symmetries. When a question asks for \"the dimension\" of such a group, it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the finite-dimensional Lie algebra of \"non-trivial\" symmetries, effectively quotienting out the infinite-dimensional \"gauge\" part.\n\n5.  **Careful Point: Comparison with Related Equations:**\n    It is important not to confuse the symmetries of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with those of other related equations.\n    *   The linear heat equation ($\\partial_t u = \\nu \\Delta u$) has a larger, 13-dimensional symmetry group in 3D, which includes special conformal transformations. These are broken by the non-linear term $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$ in the Navier-Stokes equation.\n    *   The 2D Navier-Stokes equations also have an infinite-dimensional symmetry group, which is much larger than just the pressure gauge symmetry. This is a special feature of 2D hydrodynamics that does not generalize to 3D.\n\n6.  **Conclusion: Calculating the Dimension:**\n    Summing the dimensions of the non-trivial, finite-dimensional symmetry groups identified in Step 3 gives the final answer.\n    Dimension = (Time translations) + (Space translations) + (Rotations) + (Galilean boosts) + (Scaling)\n    Dimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\nThis 11-dimensional Lie group is sometimes called the Galilean-similitude group.\n\nFinal Answer is the total dimension.\n1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11\n\n<<<11>>>"
