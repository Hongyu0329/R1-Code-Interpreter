    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a 15 by 15 by 15 cube.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Dimensions**\n*   **Container:** A cube with dimensions 15 x 15 x 15.\n*   **Object to Pack:** Rectangular blocks (bricks) with dimensions 9 x 1 x 1.\n*   **Objective:** Find the maximum number of blocks that can be placed inside the cube, assuming the blocks are aligned with the axes of the cube (no diagonal placement).\n\n**2. Initial Volume-Based Calculation (Theoretical Maximum)**\nThis step gives us an upper limit on the number of blocks. It assumes that no space is wasted.\n*   Volume of the cube = 15 × 15 × 15 = 3375 cubic units.\n*   Volume of one block = 9 × 1 × 1 = 9 cubic units.\n*   Theoretical maximum number of blocks = (Volume of cube) / (Volume of one block) = 3375 / 9 = 375.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is only a theoretical maximum. We can only achieve this number if the blocks can be arranged to fill the entire space perfectly, without any gaps.\n\n**3. Geometric Packing Strategy (The Partitioning Method)**\nSince the cube's edge length (15) is not a multiple of the block's longest dimension (9), there will inevitably be some wasted space. A good strategy is to partition the cube into smaller rectangular prisms (cuboids) that *can* be filled perfectly. A cuboid can be filled perfectly if at least one of its dimensions is a multiple of 9.\n\nWe will systematically fill the 15x15x15 cube by breaking it down.\n\n**Step A: First Partition**\n*   Take the 15x15x15 cube and partition it along one of its dimensions. We can write 15 as `9 + 6`.\n*   This divides the cube into two smaller blocks:\n    1.  A **9 x 15 x 15** block.\n    2.  A **6 x 15 x 15** block.\n\n*   **Filling the 9 x 15 x 15 block:** We can perfectly fill this space by aligning the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 9-unit dimension of this section.\n    *   Number of blocks = (9/9) × (15/1) × (15/1) = 1 × 15 × 15 = **225 blocks**.\n\n**Step B: Second Partition**\n*   Now, we analyze the remaining space: the **6 x 15 x 15** block.\n*   The blocks' 9-unit length cannot fit along the 6-unit dimension. We must align it with one of the 15-unit dimensions.\n*   Let's partition this 6x15x15 block along one of its 15-unit dimensions using the same `15 = 9 + 6` logic. This gives us two new, smaller blocks:\n    1.  A **6 x 9 x 15** block.\n    2.  A **6 x 6 x 15** block.\n\n*   **Filling the 6 x 9 x 15 block:** This space can be filled perfectly by aligning the blocks' 9-unit length with the 9-unit dimension.\n    *   Number of blocks = (6/1) × (9/9) × (15/1) = 6 × 1 × 15 = **90 blocks**.\n\n**Step C: Third Partition**\n*   We are now left with a **6 x 6 x 15** block.\n*   Again, the 9-unit length of the blocks must be aligned with the only available dimension that is large enough: the 15-unit dimension.\n*   We partition this 15-unit dimension into `9 + 6`. This breaks the 6x6x15 block into:\n    1.  A **6 x 6 x 9** block.\n    2.  A **6 x 6 x 6** block.\n\n*   **Filling the 6 x 6 x 9 block:** We can perfectly fill this by aligning the 9-unit length with the 9-unit dimension.\n    *   Number of blocks = (6/1) × (6/1) × (9/9) = 6 × 6 × 1 = **36 blocks**.\n\n**Step D: Analyzing the Final Remaining Space**\n*   The final remaining piece of the original cube is a **6 x 6 x 6** cube.\n*   **Careful Point:** A 9x1x1 block cannot fit into this space because its longest dimension (9) is larger than any of the dimensions of the remaining space (6). Therefore, this 6x6x6 cube represents wasted space. Number of blocks that can fit here is **0**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nTo find the total number of blocks, we sum the blocks from each filled partition:\n*   Total blocks = (Blocks from Step A) + (Blocks from Step B) + (Blocks from Step C)\n*   Total blocks = 225 + 90 + 36 = **351**\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   You cannot just divide the total volume by the block volume, as geometric constraints prevent a perfect fit.\n*   The partitioning method (`15 = 9 + 6`) is a systematic way to fill the space greedily.\n*   At each step, identify the largest remaining space and figure out how to best orient the blocks. This usually means aligning the block's longest side (9) with a dimension that is a multiple of 9 if possible. If not, align it with the smallest dimension that is greater than or equal to 9.\n*   It's important to track the \"leftover\" or wasted space. In this case, we are left with a 6x6x6 cube that cannot be filled, which confirms why we cannot reach the theoretical maximum of 375.\n\nThis decomposition method accounts for all the space in the cube and provides the maximal number of blocks that can be placed.\n\n<<<351>>>"
