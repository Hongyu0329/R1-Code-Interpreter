The expression for the complex magnetic field generated by the induced currents, `H_{ind}(\zeta) = H_{ind,z}(\zeta) + iH_{ind,x}(\zeta)` where `\zeta=x+iz`, is approximately given by:
`H_{ind}(\zeta) \approx \frac{-i J_c d}{2\pi} \left[ \ln\left( 1 - \frac{\sinh^2(\pi w/D)}{\sinh^2(\pi\zeta/D)} \right) + \frac{\sinh^2(\pi a/D)}{\sinh^2(\pi\zeta/D)} \right]`
The total magnetic field is `\vec{H}(x,z) = H_a \hat{z} + \vec{H}_{ind}(x,z)`. Its components are:
`H_z(x,z) = H_a + \text{Re}[H_{ind}(x+iz)]`
`H_x(x,z) = \text{Im}[H_{ind}(x+iz)]`
Here, the parameter `a` is related to the applied field `H_a` by the equation:
`H_a = \frac{J_c d}{\pi} \text{arccosh}\left( \frac{\cosh(\pi w/D)}{\cosh(\pi a/D)} \right)`
