    "This question asks for the oligomeric state (i.e., the number of helices that come together: 2 for a dimer, 3 for a trimer, etc.) of five different coiled-coil protein sequences. The primary determinant of the oligomeric state in coiled-coils is the identity of the amino acids at specific positions within the characteristic heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The most important positions are the core positions, `a` and `d`, which are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Heptad Repeat Register**\n\nAll sequences are 28 amino acids long, which corresponds to exactly four heptad repeats (4 x 7 = 28). To determine the oligomeric state, we must first correctly assign the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` positions. We do this by looking for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions. A consistent pattern emerges if we assume the first residue (E) is in the `g` position of the preceding repeat, and the heptad starts with the second residue. This establishes a `(gabcdef)` register for each 7-amino acid block.\n\nLet's test this register:\nSequence: E  I  A  X  Y  L  K\nPosition: g  **a**  b  c  **d**  e  f\nHere, `a` is at position 2 and `d` is at position 5. The spacing `d-a` is 3 residues. The next `a` position will be at `2+7=9`, and the next `d` position will be at `5+7=12`. This `(gabcdef)` register holds for all given sequences.\n\n**2. Analyze the Core Residues (`a` and `d`) for Each Sequence**\n\nWe apply well-established rules from structural biology that link the identity of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions to the oligomeric state.\n\n*   **Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQTLK`**\n    *   This appears to be a typo in the provided question, as it mixes sequence 1 and 5. Based on the pattern, the intended sequence is likely **`EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**.\n    *   **`a` positions:** I(2), I(9), I(16), I(23) -> All **Isoleucine (I)**.\n    *   **`d` positions:** A(5), A(12), A(19), A(26) -> All **Alanine (A)**.\n    *   **Rule:** The pairing of a bulky, β-branched residue (Isoleucine) at `a` with a small hydrophobic residue (Alanine) at `d` provides excellent \"knobs-into-holes\" packing for a dimeric interface.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Dimer (2)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n    *   **`a` positions:** I(2), I(9), N(16), I(23) -> Three **Isoleucine (I)** and one **Asparagine (N)**.\n    *   **`d` positions:** L(5), L(12), L(19), L(26) -> All **Leucine (L)**.\n    *   **Rule:** The presence of a polar Asparagine (N) residue in the hydrophobic `a` position is a very strong driver for dimerization. The asparagine side chains from two parallel helices form a stabilizing hydrogen bond pair in the core.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Dimer (2)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n    *   **`a` positions:** I(2), I(9), I(16), I(23) -> All **Isoleucine (I)**.\n    *   **`d` positions:** I(5), I(12), I(19), I(26) -> All **Isoleucine (I)**.\n    *   **Rule:** Placing a bulky, β-branched residue like Isoleucine at both the `a` and `d` positions creates significant steric repulsion in the cores of dimers and trimers. This unfavorable packing is relieved in a tetrameric bundle, making this `(a=I, d=I)` pattern a classic signature for tetramers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n    *   **`a` positions:** I(2), I(9), I(16), I(23) -> All **Isoleucine (I)**.\n    *   **`d` positions:** Q(5), Q(12), Q(19), Q(26) -> All **Glutamine (Q)**.\n    *   **Rule:** This `(a=I, d=Q)` pattern is complex. While polar glutamine residues at the `d` position can form a \"glutamine zipper\" that stabilizes tetramers, this is not an absolute rule. In this specific sequence context, the `e` position is occupied by Leucine (L), a hydrophobic residue. Hydrophobic residues at the `e` position are more stable in a dimeric structure than in higher-order oligomers where the `e` position is more exposed to solvent. This specific feature favors a dimeric state over a tetrameric one.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Dimer (2)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n    *   **`a` positions:** I(2), I(9), I(16), I(23) -> All **Isoleucine (I)**.\n    *   **`d` positions:** T(5), T(12), T(19), T(26) -> All **Threonine (T)**.\n    *   **Rule:** Threonine, a polar residue, at the `d` position is a hallmark of trimers. The geometry of a trimeric coiled-coil allows the three threonine hydroxyl groups at each layer of the core to form a stable, buried hydrogen-bond network.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Trimer (3)**.\n\n### Final Answer Synthesis\n\nCombining the conclusions for each sequence:\n1.  Sequence 1: **2** (Dimer)\n2.  Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n3.  Sequence 3: **4** (Tetramer)\n4.  Sequence 4: **2** (Dimer)\n5.  Sequence 5: **3** (Trimer)\n\nThe final sequence of oligomeric states is **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
