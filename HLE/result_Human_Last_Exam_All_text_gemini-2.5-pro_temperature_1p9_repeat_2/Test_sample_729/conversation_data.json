    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of a power subgroup and the generalized quaternion group, and then systematically analyzing the structure of the sets of powers of elements.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Define the Group:** The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128. A generalized quaternion group Q_4n is of order 4n. For an order of 128, we have 4n = 128, which means n = 32. The group, which we will call G = Q_128, has the presentation:\n    G = < x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, y² = x³², yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹ >\n    The elements of G consist of two types:\n    *   Elements of the form xⁱ for 0 ≤ i < 64. These form a cyclic subgroup <x> of order 64.\n    *   Elements of the form xⁱy for 0 ≤ i < 64.\n\n2.  **Define a Power Subgroup:** A subgroup H of a group G is a \"power subgroup\" if there exists an integer k such that H is equal to the set of all k-th powers of elements of G. This set is denoted by Gᵏ:\n    H = Gᵏ = { gᵏ | g ∈ G }\n\n3.  **Calculate the k-th Powers of Elements in G:** We need to find the structure of the set Gᵏ for any integer k. Let's analyze the powers of the two types of elements in G.\n    *   Powers of xⁱ: (xⁱ)ᵏ = xⁱᵏ\n    *   Powers of xⁱy: We first find the order of these elements.\n        (xⁱy)² = xⁱyxⁱy = xⁱ(yxⁱ)y = xⁱ(x⁻ⁱy)y = xⁱx⁻ⁱy² = y² = x³²\n        (xⁱy)⁴ = ((xⁱy)²)² = (x³²)² = x⁶⁴ = 1\n        So, every element of the form xⁱy has order 4.\n        The powers of g = xⁱy are:\n        *   g¹ = xⁱy\n        *   g² = x³²\n        *   g³ = g²⋅g = x³²xⁱy = x³²⁺ⁱy\n        *   g⁴ = 1\n        This pattern repeats. For any integer k, (xⁱy)ᵏ will be:\n        *   (xⁱy)ᵏ = 1                if k ≡ 0 (mod 4)\n        *   (xⁱy)ᵏ = xⁱy             if k ≡ 1 (mod 4)\n        *   (xⁱy)ᵏ = x³²              if k ≡ 2 (mod 4)\n        *   (xⁱy)ᵏ = x³²⁺ⁱy       if k ≡ 3 (mod 4)\n\n4.  **Analyze the Set Gᵏ and Determine if it's a Subgroup:** We will categorize our analysis based on the integer k. Note that G⁻ᵏ = {g⁻ᵏ} = {(g⁻¹)ᵏ} = Gᵏ since the set of inverses {g⁻¹|g∈G} is G itself. So, we only need to consider k ≥ 0.\n\n    *   **Case 1: k is odd.**\n        An odd number k is either 1 (mod 4) or 3 (mod 4).\n        If k is odd, gcd(k, 64) = 1. Therefore, the set { (xⁱ)ᵏ | 0 ≤ i < 64 } = { xⁱᵏ } is the entire cyclic group <x>.\n        The set { (xⁱy)ᵏ | 0 ≤ i < 64 } becomes either { xⁱy } (if k≡1 mod 4) or { x³²⁺ⁱy } (if k≡3 mod 4). In both cases, as i ranges from 0 to 63, the set of elements is { xʲy | 0 ≤ j < 64 }, which are all the elements of G not in <x>.\n        So, Gᵏ = {xʲ} U {xʲy} = G.\n        Since G is a group, it is a power subgroup. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n\n    *   **Case 2: k is even.** We can subdivide this into two sub-cases.\n        *   **Subcase 2a: k is a multiple of 4 (k = 4m).**\n            Gᵏ = { (xⁱ)ᵏ } U { (xⁱy)ᵏ }\n            (xⁱ)ᵏ = xⁱᵏ\n            (xⁱy)ᵏ = 1 (since k ≡ 0 mod 4)\n            So, Gᵏ = { xⁱᵏ } U {1}. This is the set { (xᵏ)ⁱ }, which is the cyclic subgroup <xᵏ>. A cyclic group is always a subgroup.\n            The distinct subgroups are of the form <xᵈ> where d = gcd(k, 64) and k is a multiple of 4. Since k is a multiple of 4, d must be a multiple of gcd(4, 64) = 4. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The multiples of 4 among them are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\n            This gives us **5** distinct power subgroups: <x⁴>, <x⁸>, <x¹⁶>, <x³²>, <x⁶⁴> = {1}.\n\n        *   **Subcase 2b: k is even but not a multiple of 4 (k = 4m + 2).**\n            Gᵏ = { (xⁱ)ᵏ } U { (xⁱy)ᵏ }\n            (xⁱ)ᵏ = xⁱᵏ\n            (xⁱy)ᵏ = x³² (since k ≡ 2 mod 4)\n            So, Gᵏ = { xⁱᵏ } U {x³²}. The set {xⁱᵏ} is the subgroup <xᵏ>. We must check if x³² is already in <xᵏ>. For any k=4m+2, gcd(k, 64) = gcd(2(2m+1), 64) = 2. So, <xᵏ> = <x²>. Since 2 divides 32, x³² = (x²)¹⁶ is an element of <x²>.\n            Therefore, for any k of this form, Gᵏ = <x²>. This is a cyclic subgroup.\n            This gives us **1** more distinct power subgroup: <x²>.\n\n5.  **Summarize and Count:**\n    We list the distinct power subgroups found:\n    1.  G (from k being any odd integer)\n    2.  <x²> (from k being even but not a multiple of 4)\n    3.  <x⁴> (from k = 4, 12, etc.)\n    4.  <x⁸> (from k = 8, 24, etc.)\n    5.  <x¹⁶> (from k = 16, 48, etc.)\n    6.  <x³²> (from k = 32)\n    7.  {1} = <x⁶⁴> (from k = 0, 64, etc.)\n\n    These 7 subgroups are all distinct. Their orders are 128, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, respectively. Since all the orders are different, the subgroups must be distinct.\n\nThus, there are a total of 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128."
