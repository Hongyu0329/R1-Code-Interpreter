    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his military campaigns in Vietnam. This primarily involves two periods: the initial Ming conquest of the Hồ dynasty (1406–1407) and the subsequent Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi (1418–1427). The initial conquest was largely successful for the Ming forces, so Mu Sheng's major defeats would have occurred during the prolonged Lam Sơn uprising.\n\n2.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Campaigns and Defeats:** Mu Sheng, based in Yunnan, led several expeditions against the Lam Sơn rebels. To find his \"first major defeat,\" we must examine his campaigns chronologically.\n    *   **Early Campaigns:** In the initial years of the uprising, the Lam Sơn rebels were often on the defensive.\n    *   **The 1422 Campaign:** In 1422, Mu Sheng led a significant Ming force to attack the Lam Sơn rebels. This campaign led to a key battle.\n    *   **The Final Campaign of 1427:** Mu Sheng co-led the final Ming reinforcement effort. His army advanced from Yunnan while another, under Liu Sheng, advanced from Guangxi. Liu Sheng's army was annihilated first. Upon hearing this news, Mu Sheng's vanguard was defeated and his demoralized army was forced into a humiliating retreat. While a massive strategic failure, this was not his *first* major defeat of the war.\n\n3.  **Focus on the First Major Defeat:** The Battle of Khả Lưu in 1422 stands out as Mu Sheng's first significant personal defeat. In this battle, his army was advancing on the Lam Sơn stronghold. The Vietnamese forces, under the command of General Lê Triện, executed a successful ambush. The Ming army was heavily defeated, suffering substantial casualties, and Mu Sheng was forced to retreat. This event is widely considered his first major setback in the war against Lam Sơn.\n\n4.  **Locate the Battlefield:** The next step is to identify the modern location of Khả Lưu. Historical sources place the fortress of Khả Lưu (ải Khả Lưu) in the western part of Nghệ An, a region that was a key theater of operations during the war.\n\n5.  **Identify the Current Province:** The historical site of Khả Lưu is located within the territory of the modern Anh Sơn District. Anh Sơn District is an administrative division of **Nghệ An Province** in present-day Vietnam.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the successful Ming-Hồ War (1406-1407) and the difficult Lam Sơn War (1418-1427). Mu Sheng's major defeats occurred in the latter.\n*   The term \"first major defeat\" points specifically to the 1422 Battle of Khả Lưu, rather than the more famous, but later, final campaign of 1427 where his army was also defeated and forced to retreat.\n*   Identifying the modern administrative division (province) requires connecting historical place names to current geography.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred at the Battle of Khả Lưu in 1422. This historical site is located in what is now Nghệ An Province.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
