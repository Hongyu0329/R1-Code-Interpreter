    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The question asks about a specific anatomical feature of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. *Irritator* is a genus of spinosaurid theropod dinosaur known from a nearly complete skull found in Brazil.\n2.  **Identify the anatomical structure:** The question focuses on the \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a bone in the skull that forms part of the margin of the eye socket (orbit) and the antorbital fenestra (an opening in front of the eye). A recess is a depression or indentation in a bone. Therefore, we are looking for a depression on the lacrimal bone.\n3.  **Locate the primary scientific source:** The most detailed and authoritative description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull is the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\" This paper provides a thorough re-description of the holotype specimen.\n4.  **Analyze the description of the lacrimal bone:** In this paper, the authors describe the bones of the skull in detail. When describing the lacrimal bone, they note the presence of a large indentation called the antorbital fossa on its side.\n5.  **Analyze the description of the lacrimal recess:** Within this larger antorbital fossa, the paper identifies the specific feature mentioned in the question: the lacrimal recess (*fossa lacrimalis*).\n6.  **Extract the specific count:** The crucial sentence in the Sues et al. (2002) paper, describing this feature, states: \"...there is a large lacrimal recess (fossa lacrimalis), which in turn **encloses two large depressions**.\"\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   It is important to rely on the primary scientific literature for anatomical details, not on generalized popular sources which may oversimplify or be inaccurate.\n*   One must distinguish between the *antorbital fossa* (a large depression on several bones including the lacrimal), the *lacrimal recess* (a smaller depression located within the antorbital fossa specifically on the lacrimal bone), and the *depressions* within the lacrimal recess. The question is specifically about the number of depressions inside the lacrimal recess.\n*   The number is explicitly stated in the definitive scientific monograph on the specimen, leaving little room for ambiguity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed anatomical description provided by Sues et al. (2002), the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains exactly two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
