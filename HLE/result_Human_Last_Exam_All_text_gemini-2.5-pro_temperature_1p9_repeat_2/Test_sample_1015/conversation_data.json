    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Movement:** A *cambré derrière* is a classical ballet movement where the dancer bends the upper body backwards from the waist. It is a test of flexibility, strength, and control.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach:**\n    *   The Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova, is known for its rigorous codification, precision, and strength-building.\n    *   In a Vaganova *cambré derrière*, the primary rule is to maintain correct alignment and stability.\n    *   The bend initiates from the upper back (thoracic spine), with the chest and sternum lifting towards the ceiling.\n    *   Crucially, the hips must remain absolutely square to the front and directly over the supporting feet/legs. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault, as it compromises the core stability and the integrity of the classical line.\n    *   The goal is to create a pure, clean arc in the upper spine while the lower body remains a stable, unwavering base.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach:**\n    *   The Balanchine method (or style), developed by George Balanchine, emphasizes speed, musicality, and a larger, more \"neo-classical\" aesthetic. It often exaggerates or modifies classical positions for dramatic effect.\n    *   In a Balanchine *cambré derrière*, the aesthetic goal is often a deeper, more extreme backbend.\n    *   To achieve this deeper bend, the dancer is typically encouraged to push the hips forward, beyond the alignment of the feet.\n    *   This creates a much more dramatic, \"broken\" line compared to the Vaganova method. It sacrifices the strict vertical alignment of the hips over the feet in favor of a greater range of motion and a visually spectacular pose.\n\n4.  **Compare the Key Differences and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in how arms are held (port de bras) and the specific look of an *allongé* (extended line) in each method, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the mechanics of the *cambré derrière* itself.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant and defining technical difference. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and vertically aligned over the feet. Balanchine allows and often requires pushing the hips forward. This core mechanical difference dictates the entire look, feel, and execution of the movement in each style.\n    *   **C. Speed:** Balanchine's choreography is famous for its speed, but a *cambré* itself can be performed at any speed in either method. Speed is a general characteristic of the style, not a defining rule for this specific step.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The difference in the degree of the backbend is a *result* of the differing techniques, not the root cause of the difference. The Balanchine method achieves a deeper backbend *because* it allows the hips to move forward. The placement of the hip (B) is the fundamental technical instruction that leads to the difference in degree (D). Therefore, B is the more precise and causal answer.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head generally follows the line of the spine, looking up and back. While there may be subtle stylistic nuances, the basic principle is the same. It is not the primary point of divergence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most critical point of distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine execution of a *cambré derrière* is the instruction regarding hip placement. Vaganova prioritizes stability and upper back articulation with stationary hips, while Balanchine prioritizes a dramatic line achieved by pushing the hips forward.\n\n<<<B>>>"
