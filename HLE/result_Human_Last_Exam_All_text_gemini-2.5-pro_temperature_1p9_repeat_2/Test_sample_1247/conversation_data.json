    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\n**1. Understanding the Notation**\n*   \\(S_n\\): The set of permutations of \\(\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}\\).\n*   \\(\\pi \\in S_n\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\).\n*   An inversion in \\(\\pi\\) is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\). The number of inversions is denoted by \\(inv(\\pi)\\).\n*   \\(av_n^k(\\tau)\\) is the number of \\(\\tau\\)-avoiding permutations in \\(S_n\\) with exactly \\(k\\) inversions.\n*   We need to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions.\n\n**2. Characterizing Permutations with 3 Inversions**\n\nA permutation has a small number of inversions if it is \"close\" to the identity permutation \\(1, 2, \\dots, n\\). Permutations with exactly 3 inversions can be constructed by applying a sequence of three adjacent transpositions to the identity permutation. Based on how these transpositions interact, we can classify the structure of permutations with 3 inversions. The main structures are:\n\n*   **Type A:** The permutation contains a single block of three consecutive numbers in decreasing order.\n    The permutation has the form: \\(\\pi = 1, \\dots, i-1, \\mathbf{i+2, i+1, i}, i+3, \\dots, n\\).\n    The inversions are \\((\\pi_i, \\pi_{i+1})=(i+2, i+1)\\), \\((\\pi_i, \\pi_{i+2})=(i+2, i)\\), and \\((\\pi_{i+1}, \\pi_{i+2})=(i+1, i)\\). There are 3 inversions in total.\n    For \\(n=333\\), the index \\(i\\) can range from 1 to \\(333-2=331\\).\n\n*   **Type B:** The permutation contains a block of four consecutive numbers in the pattern \\(dabc\\).\n    The permutation has the form: \\(\\pi = 1, \\dots, i-1, \\mathbf{i+3, i, i+1, i+2}, i+4, \\dots, n\\).\n    The inversions are \\((\\pi_i, \\pi_{i+1})=(i+3, i)\\), \\((\\pi_i, \\pi_{i+2})=(i+3, i+1)\\), and \\((\\pi_i, \\pi_{i+3})=(i+3, i+2)\\). There are 3 inversions in total.\n    For \\(n=333\\), the index \\(i\\) can range from 1 to \\(333-3=330\\).\n\n*   **Other structures:** Other ways to form 3 inversions include permutations like \\(2413\\), \\(3142\\), or three disjoint swaps like in \\(214365\\). We will analyze if these can avoid the 1324 pattern.\n\n**3. Analyzing each type for the 1324-pattern**\n\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains a 1324 pattern if there exist indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i_3} < \\pi_{i_2} < \\pi_{i_4}\\).\nThe core of this pattern is an inversion pair \\((\\pi_{i_2}, \\pi_{i_3})\\) with \\(i_2 < i_3\\). We look for an element \\(\\pi_{i_1}\\) before this pair and smaller than \\(\\pi_{i_3}\\), and an element \\(\\pi_{i_4}\\) after this pair and larger than \\(\\pi_{i_2}\\).\n\n**Analysis of Type A:** \\(\\pi_i^{(A)} = 1, \\dots, i-1, \\mathbf{i+2, i+1, i}, i+3, \\dots, n\\)\n\nLet's test for a 1324 pattern. We can choose the inversion pair \\((\\pi_b, \\pi_c)\\) from the descending block. Let \\(i_2 = i+1\\) and \\(i_3 = i+2\\). The values are \\(\\pi_{i_2} = i+1\\) and \\(\\pi_{i_3} = i\\).\n*   We need an index \\(i_1 < i_2 = i+1\\) such that \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i_3} = i\\). If \\(i > 1\\), we can choose \\(i_1 = i-1\\), for which \\(\\pi_{i_1} = i-1 < i\\).\n*   We need an index \\(i_4 > i_3 = i+2\\) such that \\(\\pi_{i_4} > \\pi_{i_2} = i+1\\). If \\(n \\ge i+3\\), we can choose \\(i_4 = i+3\\), for which \\(\\pi_{i_4} = i+3 > i+1\\).\n\nA 1324 pattern exists if we can find such \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_4\\). This is possible if \\(i-1 \\ge 1\\) (i.e., \\(i > 1\\)) and \\(i+3 \\le n\\).\nFor \\(n=333\\), a pattern exists for \\(i \\in [2, 330]\\).\n\nWe must check the boundary cases where the condition does not hold:\n*   Case \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = 3, 2, 1, 4, \\dots, 333\\). There is no index \\(i_1 < 1\\). Thus, no 1324 pattern can be formed. This is a 1324-avoiding permutation.\n*   Case \\(i=n-2=331\\): \\(\\pi = 1, 2, \\dots, 330, \\mathbf{333, 332, 331}\\). The condition \\(n \\ge i+3\\) is \\(333 \\ge 331+3 = 334\\), which is false. There is no index \\(i_4 > i+2 = 333\\). Thus, no 1324 pattern can be formed. This is a 1324-avoiding permutation.\n\nSo, from Type A permutations, we find 2 that are 1324-avoiding.\n\n**Analysis of Type B:** \\(\\pi_i^{(B)} = 1, \\dots, i-1, \\mathbf{i+3, i, i+1, i+2}, i+4, \\dots, n\\)\n\nLet's test for a 1324 pattern. We can choose the inversion pair \\((\\pi_{i_2}, \\pi_{i_3})\\) where \\(i_2=i\\) and \\(i_3=i+1\\). The values are \\(\\pi_i = i+3\\) and \\(\\pi_{i+1}=i\\).\n*   We need an index \\(i_1 < i_2 = i\\) with \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i_3}=i\\). If \\(i > 1\\), we can choose \\(i_1 = i-1\\), where \\(\\pi_{i-1} = i-1 < i\\).\n*   We need an index \\(i_4 > i_3 = i+1\\) with \\(\\pi_{i_4} > \\pi_{i_2}=i+3\\). If \\(n \\ge i+4\\), we can choose \\(i_4=i+4\\), where \\(\\pi_{i_4}=i+4 > i+3\\).\n\nA 1324 pattern exists if \\(i > 1\\) and \\(n \\ge i+4\\).\nFor \\(n=333\\), a pattern exists for \\(i \\in [2, 329]\\).\n\nWe check the boundary cases:\n*   Case \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots, 333\\). There is no index \\(i_1 < 1\\). Thus, this is a 1324-avoiding permutation.\n*   Case \\(i=n-3=330\\): \\(\\pi = 1, \\dots, 329, \\mathbf{333, 330, 331, 332}\\). The condition \\(n \\ge i+4\\) is \\(333 \\ge 330+4 = 334\\), which is false. The largest element in the permutation is \\(\\pi_i=333\\), so no \\(\\pi_{i_4}\\) can be larger. Thus, this is a 1324-avoiding permutation.\n\nSo, from Type B permutations, we find 2 that are 1324-avoiding.\n\n**Analysis of Other Structures**\nPermutations with 3 inversions that do not fall into Type A or B have their inversions more \"spread out\". For instance:\n*   Three disjoint inversions: e.g., \\(\\pi = 2,1,4,3,6,5,...\\). A 1324 pattern can almost always be formed. Let's say the three inversions are \\(p_1, p_2, p_3\\). The inversion \\(p_2\\) in the middle, \\((v_2+1, v_2)\\), can play the role of \\((\\pi_{i_2}, \\pi_{i_3})\\). An element from the inversion \\(p_1\\) can be \\(\\pi_{i_1}\\), and an element from \\(p_3\\) can be \\(\\pi_{i_4}\\). Since \\(n=333\\) is large, these three inversions cannot all be at the very beginning or end, so such \\(\\pi_{i_1}\\) and \\(\\pi_{i_4}\\) can be found. Therefore, these permutations contain the 1324 pattern.\n*   Permutations like \\(2413...\\) and \\(3142...\\): Let's test \\(\\pi = 2,4,1,3,5,...,333\\). Inversions are (2,1), (4,1), (4,3). Let's search for \\(i_1<i_2<i_3<i_4\\) with \\(\\pi_{i_1}<\\pi_{i_3}<\\pi_{i_2}<\\pi_{i_4}\\). Take \\(i_1=1, i_2=2, i_3=4, i_4=5\\). This satisfies \\(i_1<i_2<i_3<i_4\\). The values are \\(\\pi_1=2, \\pi_2=4, \\pi_4=3, \\pi_5=5\\). We check \\(\\pi_1 < \\pi_4 < \\pi_2 < \\pi_5\\), which is \\(2 < 3 < 4 < 5\\). This is true. So, this permutation has a 1324 pattern. A similar analysis shows that other complex structures for 3 inversions also contain the 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe permutations with 3 inversions that avoid the 1324 pattern are those where the inversions are \"compact\" and located at one of the ends of the permutation. Our analysis of Type A and B permutations revealed four such permutations:\n\n1.  \\(\\pi = 3,2,1,4,5,...,333\\)\n2.  \\(\\pi = 1,2,...,330,333,332,331\\)\n3.  \\(\\pi = 4,1,2,3,5,...,333\\)\n4.  \\(\\pi = 1,2,...,329,333,330,331,332\\)\n\nFor \\(n=333\\), these are the only permutations with 3 inversions that avoid the 1324 pattern. Therefore, \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 4\\).\n\n<<<4>>>"
