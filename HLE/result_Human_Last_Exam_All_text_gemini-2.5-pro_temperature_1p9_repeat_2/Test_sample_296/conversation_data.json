    "This problem asks for the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group $G$. We can solve this by classifying subgroups based on their properties, specifically whether they are normal or non-normal. A subgroup $H$ of index 4 in a group $G$ corresponds to a transitive group action of $G$ on the set of 4 cosets of $H$. This action is defined by a homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to S_4$, and the image of this homomorphism, $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$, must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify possible quotient groups**\nThe Grigorchuk group $G$ is a 2-group, which means every element has an order that is a power of 2. Consequently, any finite quotient of $G$ must also be a 2-group. The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), $V_4$ (Klein four-group, isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_2$), $D_8$ (dihedral group of order 8), $A_4$ (alternating group of order 12), and $S_4$ itself. Of these, only $C_4$, $V_4$, and $D_8$ are 2-groups. Therefore, the image $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$ of the action homomorphism must be one of these three groups.\n\nWe analyze each case.\n\n**Step 2: Normal subgroups of index 4**\nA subgroup $H$ of index 4 is normal if and only if the action of $G$ on the cosets $G/H$ has a kernel equal to $H$. This means that $G/H$ is isomorphic to the image group $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$, which must be a group of order 4.\nThe possible quotient groups of order 4 are $C_4$ and $V_4$.\n\n*   **Case 1: Quotients isomorphic to $C_4$**\n    Any homomorphism from a group $G$ to an abelian group (like $C_4$) must factor through its abelianization, $G_{ab} = G/[G,G]$. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be $G_{ab} \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    So, any homomorphism from $G$ to $C_4$ corresponds to a homomorphism from $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ to $C_4$. Let $\\psi: C_2^3 \\to C_4$. For any generator $u \\in C_2^3$, we have $u^2=e$. Thus, its image must satisfy $\\psi(u)^2 = e$. The only elements in $C_4$ with order dividing 2 are the identity and the element of order 2. Therefore, the image of any such homomorphism is contained in the unique subgroup of order 2 within $C_4$. This means there are no epimorphisms (surjective homomorphisms) from $G$ to $C_4$. Consequently, the Grigorchuk group has no normal subgroups with a quotient isomorphic to $C_4$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Quotients isomorphic to $V_4$**\n    We need to find the number of normal subgroups $N$ such that $G/N \\cong V_4$. This is equivalent to counting the number of epimorphisms from $G$ to $V_4 = C_2 \\times C_2$. Again, these homomorphisms factor through $G_{ab} \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$. We need to count the number of epimorphisms $\\psi: C_2^3 \\to C_2^2$.\n    In the language of vector spaces over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this is counting the number of surjective linear maps from a 3-dimensional space to a 2-dimensional space. The kernel of such a map is a subspace of dimension $3-2=1$. Each 1-dimensional subspace of $(\\mathbb{F}_2)^3$ defines a unique epimorphism up to the choice of basis in the target space.\n    The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in $(\\mathbb{F}_2)^3$ is the number of non-zero vectors (which is $2^3 - 1 = 7$) divided by the number of non-zero vectors in a 1-dimensional space (which is $2^1-1=1$). So, there are $7/1=7$ such subspaces.\n    Each of these 7 kernels corresponds to a distinct normal subgroup of index 4.\n    Therefore, there are **7** normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n**Step 3: Non-normal subgroups of index 4**\nA subgroup $H$ of index 4 is non-normal if the core of $H$, $\\text{Core}_G(H) = \\bigcap_{g \\in G} gHg^{-1}$, is a proper subgroup of $H$. The quotient group $G/\\text{Core}_G(H)$ is isomorphic to the image of the action, $\\text{Im}(\\phi) \\subset S_4$.\nFor a non-normal subgroup, the action must not be regular, which means the point-stabilizer in the image group is non-trivial.\n*   If $\\text{Im}(\\phi) \\cong V_4$, the action is regular, and the corresponding subgroup must be normal. We have already counted these.\n*   The only remaining possibility for the image group is $D_8$. An action with image $D_8$ would have $|G/\\text{Core}_G(H)| = |D_8|=8$.\n    This requires an epimorphism from $G$ onto $D_8$. It is a known result for the Grigorchuk group that it has a unique normal subgroup $N$ such that $G/N \\cong D_8$. This subgroup is the stabilizer of the second level of the binary tree, denoted $St_G(2)$, and has index 8 in $G$.\n    Let $\\phi_0: G \\to G/St_G(2) \\cong D_8$ be the canonical projection.\n    A non-normal subgroup $H$ of index 4 must have $\\text{Core}_G(H) = St_G(2)$.\n    $H$ contains $St_G(2)$, so $H/St_G(2)$ is a subgroup of $G/St_G(2) \\cong D_8$.\n    The index is related by the formula $[G:St_G(2)] = [G:H][H:St_G(2)]$.\n    We have $8 = 4 \\cdot [H:St_G(2)]$, which implies $[H:St_G(2)]=2$.\n    So $H/St_G(2)$ must be a subgroup of order 2 in $D_8$.\n    Furthermore, for $H$ to be non-normal in $G$, the subgroup $H/St_G(2)$ must be non-normal in $G/St_G(2) \\cong D_8$.\n    The group $D_8$ has 5 subgroups of order 2. One of them is the center, $Z(D_8)$, which is normal. The other 4 are generated by reflections and are non-normal.\n    Each of these 4 non-normal subgroups of order 2 in $D_8$ gives rise to a distinct non-normal subgroup of index 4 in $G$ via the preimage under $\\phi_0$.\n    Therefore, there are **4** non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n**Step 4: Total count**\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the number of normal and non-normal subgroups.\nTotal number = (Number of normal subgroups) + (Number of non-normal subgroups)\nTotal number = 7 + 4 = 11."
