    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Components of the Question\n*   **\"Academy Award for Best Picture\":** We need to consider the list of films that have won this specific award.\n*   **\"Luxor Obelisk\":** This is a key detail. There are two famous Luxor Obelisks originating from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n    *   One remains in its original location in **Luxor, Egypt**.\n    *   The other was transported to **Paris, France**, in the 1830s and now stands at the center of the Place de la Concorde.\n    A film depicting either of these locations would satisfy the question.\n*   **\"First Winner\":** The crucial requirement is to find the earliest film on the chronological list of Best Picture winners that meets the criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Search Strategy\nThe most logical approach is to go through the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, starting from the first awards in 1929 (for films of 1927/1928), and analyze each film for potential depictions of Paris or Luxor.\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Analysis of Best Picture Winners\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:**\n    *   `Wings` (1927/28), `The Broadway Melody` (1928/29), `All Quiet on the Western Front` (1929/30), `Cimarron` (1930/31), `Grand Hotel` (1931/32), `Cavalcade` (1932/33), `It Happened One Night` (1934), `Mutiny on the Bounty` (1935), `The Great Ziegfeld` (1936). None of these films are set in Paris or Luxor.\n    *   `The Life of Emile Zola` (1937): This film is set in Paris. It's a plausible early candidate. However, a review of the film shows that its cinematography focuses heavily on interiors (courtrooms, offices) and close-ups of characters. It does not feature establishing shots of major landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   `You Can't Take It With You` (1938), `Gone with the Wind` (1939): These are set in America and do not contain the obelisk.\n\n*   **1940s:**\n    *   The winners of the 1940s (`Rebecca`, `How Green Was My Valley`, `Mrs. Miniver`, `Casablanca`, etc.) are primarily set in England, Wales, Morocco, or the USA. None of them feature the required locations.\n\n*   **1950s:** This decade presents several strong candidates set in Paris.\n    *   `All About Eve` (1950): Set in New York's theater world. No.\n    *   `An American in Paris` (1951): This film is a musical celebration of Paris. The famous 17-minute final ballet sequence is a fantasy tour of the city, imagined through the styles of various French painters. During the part inspired by Raoul Dufy, there is a clear, stylized depiction of the Place de la Concorde with the Luxor Obelisk at its center. This is a confirmed sighting.\n    *   `The Greatest Show on Earth` (1952), `From Here to Eternity` (1953), `On the Waterfront` (1954), `Marty` (1955): None of these are set in the correct location.\n    *   `Around the World in 80 Days` (1956): This film features a global journey that includes both Paris and Egypt. The Paris sequence includes live-action shots of the Place de la Concorde, clearly showing the obelisk. However, this film won five years *after* `An American in Paris`. The Egypt sequence focuses on the Suez Canal and the Pyramids at Giza, not the Luxor Temple.\n    *   `Gigi` (1958): Another musical set in Paris that features extensive on-location photography, including shots where the Place de la Concorde is visible. This also comes after `An American in Paris`.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on the chronological review, we must identify the very first film to meet the criterion.\n1.  `The Life of Emile Zola` (1937), despite being set in Paris, does not appear to contain a shot of the obelisk.\n2.  `An American in Paris` (1951) contains a definite, albeit artistically rendered, depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde during its final ballet sequence.\n3.  Later films like `Around the World in 80 Days` (1956) and `Gigi` (1958) also feature the obelisk, but `An American in Paris` is the earliest winner to do so.\n\nTherefore, the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen is `An American in Paris`.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
