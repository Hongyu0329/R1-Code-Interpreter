    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are asked to find the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a subset $A$ of $\\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$ with size $|A| \\approx cN$ for large $N$, and the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 : a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect square numbers. The notation $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ means that the limit of $|A|/N$ as $N \\to \\infty$ is $c$.\n\nThe condition is: for all $x, y \\in A$, $x+y \\neq k^2$ for any integer $k$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound for c with a Constructive Method\nA powerful technique for problems like this is to use modular arithmetic. We try to find a modulus $m$ and a set of residues $I \\subseteq \\{0, 1, ..., m-1\\}$ such that for any $i, j \\in I$, the sum $i+j \\pmod m$ is never a quadratic residue modulo $m$. If we can find such a pair $(m, I)$, we can construct our set $A$ as:\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} : n \\pmod m \\in I\\}$.\nThe size of this set will be approximately $|I| \\cdot (N/m)$, so the density is $c = |I|/m$.\n\nLet's test this strategy with a small modulus, $m=3$.\nThe quadratic residues modulo 3 are the values that $k^2 \\pmod 3$ can take:\n*   $0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$\n*   $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\nSo, the set of quadratic residues modulo 3 is $S_Q = \\{0, 1\\}$. The value $2$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo 3.\n\nWe want to choose our set of residues $I \\subseteq \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ such that for any $i, j \\in I$, their sum $i+j \\pmod 3$ is a non-residue. That is, $i+j \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n\nLet's try to choose $I$:\n*   If we choose $I=\\{0\\}$, then $0+0=0 \\in S_Q$. Fails.\n*   If we choose $I=\\{2\\}$, then $2+2=4\\equiv 1 \\in S_Q$. Fails.\n*   If we choose $I=\\{1\\}$, then $1+1=2$. Since $2 \\notin S_Q$, this condition is satisfied.\n*   If we choose any $I$ with more than one element, say $\\{0, 1\\}$, then $0+1=1 \\in S_Q$. Fails. If $I=\\{1,2\\}$, then $1+2=3\\equiv 0 \\in S_Q$. Fails.\n\nSo, the only choice that works is $I=\\{1\\}$.\nLet's construct the set $A$ based on this:\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\nFor any two elements $x, y \\in A$, we have $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $y \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Their sum is $x+y \\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$.\nSince no perfect square can be congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$, the sumset $A+A$ contains no squares.\n\nNow let's calculate the size of this set $A$.\n$A = \\{1, 4, 7, 10, ...\\}$. The elements are of the form $3k+1$.\n$1 \\le 3k+1 \\le N \\implies 0 \\le 3k \\le N-1 \\implies 0 \\le k \\le (N-1)/3$.\nThe number of possible integer values for $k$ is $\\lfloor(N-1)/3\\rfloor + 1 = \\lfloor(N+2)/3\\rfloor$.\nFor large $N$, $|A| \\approx N/3$.\nSo, the density is $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N} = 1/3$.\nThis construction shows that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n### Step 3: Investigating if a larger c is possible (Upper Bound)\nLet's analyze an arbitrary set $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ with density $c = |A|/N$. We can partition $A$ into three subsets based on their residues modulo 3:\n*   $A_0 = \\{a \\in A : a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$\n*   $A_1 = \\{a \\in A : a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n*   $A_2 = \\{a \\in A : a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$\n\nLet the asymptotic densities of these subsets be $c_0, c_1, c_2$. Then $|A_i| \\approx c_i N$ and $c = c_0+c_1+c_2$. The maximum possible density for a residue class is $1/3$, so $0 \\le c_i \\le 1/3$.\n\nThe sumset $A+A$ is the union of the sumsets $A_i+A_j$ for $i,j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$. Let's look at the sums modulo 3:\n*   $A_1+A_1$: sums are all $\\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$. These can never be squares. This sumset is \"safe\".\n*   $A_0+A_2$: sums are all $\\equiv 0+2=2 \\pmod 3$. This sumset is also \"safe\".\n*   $A_0+A_0$: sums are $\\equiv 0+0=0 \\pmod 3$. Can be squares.\n*   $A_2+A_2$: sums are $\\equiv 2+2=1 \\pmod 3$. Can be squares.\n*   $A_0+A_1$: sums are $\\equiv 0+1=1 \\pmod 3$. Can be squares.\n*   $A_1+A_2$: sums are $\\equiv 1+2=0 \\pmod 3$. Can be squares.\n\nThe \"problematic\" sumsets are those whose sums can be squares. This occurs whenever we have a sumset producing sums $\\equiv 0$ or $1 \\pmod 3$.\nTheorems in additive combinatorics (such as Sárközy's theorem and its extensions) state that if a set has a positive density, its sumset must contain elements of any \"reasonably behaved\" sequence, including squares (or squares within a certain congruence class).\nFor example, if $c_2 > 0$, the set $A_2$ has a positive density among numbers $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. It is known that $A_2+A_2$ must contain a square if $|A_2|$ is large enough (specifically, $|A_2|$ doesn't need to be very large). This means for $A+A$ to contain no squares, we must have $c_2 = 0$. A similar argument holds for $c_0 = 0$.\n\nLet's spell out the argument more formally:\n1.  If $c_0 > 0$, then $|A_0| = (c_0+o(1))N$. For $A_0+A_0$ to be square-free, we require $3k_1+3k_2 = 3(k_1+k_2) \\ne m^2$. This means $k_1+k_2$ must not be of the form $3j^2$. The set $\\{k \\mid 3k \\in A_0\\}$ has density $3c_0$ in $\\{1, ..., N/3\\}$. Additive combinatorics results suggest such a set will have sums of the form $3j^2$. Thus, we must have $c_0=0$.\n2.  Similarly, if $c_2>0$, the sumset $A_2+A_2$ would contain squares congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$. So we must have $c_2=0$.\n3.  Now, assume $c_1>0$ and try to have $c_0>0$ or $c_2>0$. Suppose $c_1>0$ and $c_0>0$. The sumset $A_0+A_1$ creates sums $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, which can be squares. The pair of positive-density sets $A_0$ and $A_1$ would produce sums that include squares. Therefore, we cannot simultaneously have $c_0>0$ and $c_1>0$.\n4.  By the same token, we can't have $c_1>0$ and $c_2>0$ (since $A_1+A_2$ creates sums $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$).\n\nThis reasoning forces us to conclude that to achieve a positive density $c$, at most one of the densities $c_0, c_1, c_2$ can be non-zero.\n*   If we choose $c_0 > 0$ (so $c_1=c_2=0$), the sumset is $A_0+A_0$. This requires $c_0=0$. No positive density.\n*   If we choose $c_2 > 0$ (so $c_0=c_1=0$), the sumset is $A_2+A_2$. This requires $c_2=0$. No positive density.\n*   If we choose $c_1 > 0$ (so $c_0=c_2=0$), the sumset is $A_1+A_1$. The sums are all $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, which is always square-free. This case is \"safe\". We can choose $A_1$ to be the entire set of numbers congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$ up to $N$. This gives $c_1=1/3$.\n\nThus, the maximum possible density is $c=1/3$. Any attempt to add numbers from other residue classes mod 3 would create sumsets that are expected to contain squares, forcing the density of those added numbers to be zero.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe construction $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ gives a set of density $1/3$ where $A+A$ contains no squares. The analysis using modular arithmetic and principles of additive combinatorics strongly suggests that it's not possible to exceed this density. Therefore, the largest number $c$ is $1/3$."
