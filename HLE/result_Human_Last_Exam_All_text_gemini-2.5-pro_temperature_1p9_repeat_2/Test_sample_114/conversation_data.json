    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a word from the given list that Geoffrey Chaucer does not use to form a rhyme within his poem, \"Book of the Duchess\". This requires checking the text of the poem to see if each word is present at the end of a line and paired with a rhyming word.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Wente:**\n    *   **Meaning:** \"Went\" in Middle English.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a common word, so it's highly likely to be used in a rhyme. We need to find an example in the text.\n    *   **Analysis:** In \"Book of the Duchess\", we can find the following couplet (lines 443-444 in some editions):\n        > \"That ther-fore to the temple **wente**\n        > To pray the goddes me to **sente**\"\n    *   **Conclusion:** \"Wente\" clearly rhymes with \"sente\". Therefore, Chaucer *does* make a rhyme with this word. This answer is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. Here:**\n    *   **Meaning:** \"Here\" (as in this place) or \"here\" (to hear).\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must check for both meanings and various spellings like 'heere'.\n    *   **Analysis:** In the poem, we find this couplet (lines 275-276):\n        > \"That pite was to **here**\n        > Hys sorwe, and for to se hys **chere**.\"\n    *   **Conclusion:** \"Here\" (hear) rhymes with \"chere\" (face, expression). Chaucer *does* make a rhyme with this word. This answer is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. Fool:**\n    *   **Meaning:** \"Fool\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** We need to search the poem to see if \"fool\" (or \"foole\") appears at the end of a line and if it rhymes.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word \"fool\" does appear in the poem (e.g., line 515: \"...what, is he wood? He is a fool!\"). However, a search of the poem shows that it does not appear at the end of a line as part of a rhyming couplet. So, it's a possible answer.\n\n*   **D. Hool:**\n    *   **Meaning:** \"Whole\" or \"healthy\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** Similar to \"fool\", we need to check if \"hool\" appears at the end of a line and rhymes with another word.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word \"hool\" (and its adverb form \"hooly\") appears in the poem (e.g., line 553: \"That he was hool, and knew no wight,\" and line 711: \"shalt hooly, with al thy wyt\"). But like \"fool\", it is not used at the end of a line to create a rhyme in \"Book of the Duchess\". So, it's also a possible answer.\n\n*   **E. Countour:**\n    *   **Meaning:** An accountant, or a pleader in court (a type of lawyer).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most unusual word in the list. The first step is to verify if the word even exists within the \"Book of the Duchess\".\n    *   **Analysis:** A search of the full text of \"Book of the Duchess\" reveals that the word \"countour\" does not appear anywhere in the poem. Chaucer famously uses this word in the General Prologue to the *Canterbury Tales* to describe the Sergeant of the Lawe (\"A shirreve hadde he been, and a **contour**; / Was nowher such a worthy vavasour.\"), where it does rhyme. However, it is entirely absent from the \"Book of the Duchess\".\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Plausible Answers (C, D, and E)**\nWe have three candidates. Chaucer does not make a rhyme with \"fool\" or \"hool\" in the poem, even though the words are present. However, Chaucer *cannot* make a rhyme with \"countour\" because he never uses the word in this specific poem. The absence of the word itself is a more definitive reason for it not being rhymed than the word's placement within the poetic line. Therefore, \"Countour\" is the strongest and most correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$.\n\n<<<E>>>"
