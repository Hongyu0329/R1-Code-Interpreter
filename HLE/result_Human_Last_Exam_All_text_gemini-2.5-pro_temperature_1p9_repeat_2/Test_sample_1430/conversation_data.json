    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Neron-Severi Group of a Symmetric Power**\n\nThe primary object of study is $X = C^{(15)}$, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve $C$. $X$ is the variety of effective divisors of degree 15 on $C$. We want to find the rank of its Neron-Severi group, $\\rho(X) = \\text{rank}(NS(X))$.\n\nThere is a fundamental formula, due to Macdonald, that relates the cohomology (and thus the Neron-Severi group) of the symmetric power of a curve to the cohomology of the curve itself and its Jacobian variety, $J(C)$. For the Neron-Severi group, the relation is surprisingly simple:\n\n$\\rho(C^{(d)}) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\n\nfor any degree $d \\geq 1$.\n\nHere, $J(C)$ is the Jacobian of $C$, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$. The term `1` comes from a \"tautological\" divisor class on $C^{(d)}$ which does not arise from the Jacobian. This formula transforms our problem about the symmetric power $X = C^{(15)}$ into a problem about its Jacobian, $J(C)$. The degree, 15, does not affect the rank.\n\n**Our goal is now to find the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, where $C$ is a genus 3 curve.**\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Neron-Severi Group of a Jacobian**\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety $A$, $\\rho(A)$, is a measure of how many independent algebraic 1-cycles (or line bundles) exist on $A$. This number is intricately linked to the structure of the endomorphism ring of $A$.\n\n*   An abelian variety always has endomorphisms given by multiplication by integers, so $\\text{End}(A)$ always contains $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   When $\\text{End}(A)$ is larger than $\\mathbb{Z}$, the variety is said to have **complex multiplication (CM)**. More endomorphisms can create more algebraic cycles, potentially increasing the Neron-Severi rank.\n\nThe variation in $\\rho(X)$ for different genus 3 curves $C$ is entirely due to the variation in $\\rho(J(C))$ across the moduli space of genus 3 curves, $\\mathcal{M}_3$.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Smallest Possible Rank**\n\nThe smallest rank will occur for a \"generic\" curve $C$.\nA generic curve $C$ of genus 3 is non-hyperelliptic and its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a **simple** abelian variety (it does not contain any smaller-dimensional abelian subvarieties).\n\nFor a generic, simple, principally polarized abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$ (like the Jacobian of a generic curve), the endomorphism ring is as small as possible: $\\text{End}(A) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIn this case, the Neron-Severi group $NS(A)$ is also as small as possible. It is generated solely by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Therefore, its rank is 1.\n\nSo, for a generic curve $C$ of genus 3:\n$\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n\nUsing our formula from Step 1, the smallest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Largest Possible Rank**\n\nThe largest rank will occur for a highly specialized curve $C$ whose Jacobian $J(C)$ has the richest possible structure of endomorphisms.\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of a complex abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$ is bounded by the dimension of the Hodge group $H^{1,1}(A)$, which is $g^2$. This is a consequence of the Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties (which is known to be true).\nSo, for $J(C)$, we have the bound:\n$\\rho(J(C)) \\le g^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n\nThe question is whether this theoretical maximum can actually be achieved. The bound $\\rho(A) = g^2$ is attained if and only if $A$ is isogenous to a product of $g$ copies of a single elliptic curve with complex multiplication, i.e., $A \\sim E^g$ where $E$ is a CM elliptic curve.\n\nSo, the largest possible rank $\\rho(J(C))=9$ is achieved if there exists a genus 3 curve $C$ whose Jacobian is isogenous to $E^3$ for some CM elliptic curve $E$. Such curves exist. The most famous example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation:\n$x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$\nThis is a smooth curve of genus $g=3$. Its Jacobian, $J(C)$, is known to be isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - x$. This elliptic curve has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nFor such a curve $C$:\n$\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n\nUsing our formula from Step 1, the largest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Key Formula:** The rank of the Neron-Severi group of $C^{(d)}$ is directly related to that of its Jacobian by the formula $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$. The degree $d=15$ is irrelevant to the final answer, as long as $d \\ge 1$.\n2.  **Generic vs. Special:** The range of possible ranks arises from considering the entire moduli space of genus 3 curves. The minimum corresponds to a generic curve, while the maximum corresponds to a very specific, \"special\" curve with maximal complex multiplication.\n3.  **The Minimum Case:** For a generic curve $C$, the Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian threefold with no complex multiplication ($\\text{End}(J(C))=\\mathbb{Z}$). This leads to the minimal Neron-Severi rank, $\\rho(J(C))=1$.\n4.  **The Maximum Case:** The absolute upper bound for the Neron-Severi rank of a $g$-dimensional abelian variety is $g^2$. For the largest rank to be achieved for $J(C)$, it must be isogenous to $E^g$ for a CM elliptic curve $E$. It is a non-trivial fact that such curves exist for $g=3$ (e.g., the Fermat quartic).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The smallest possible rank of $NS(X)$ occurs for a generic curve $C$, where $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n    Smallest Rank = $1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   The largest possible rank of $NS(X)$ occurs for a curve $C$ with maximal CM (like the Fermat quartic), where $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2 = 9$.\n    Largest Rank = $1 + 9 = 10$.\n\nThe smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of X are 2 and 10, respectively.\n\n<<<Smallest rank is 2, largest rank is 10.>>>"
