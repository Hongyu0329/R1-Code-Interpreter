    "This problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can coexist as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` that has `n = 128` vertices.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Terms\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices `|V|` is 128.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices `S ⊆ V` is a clique if for every two distinct vertices `u, v ∈ S`, the edge `(u, v)` is in `E`. A clique of size `k` is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph whose vertex set is `S` and whose edge set consists of all edges in `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find a single graph `G` on 128 vertices that maximizes the number of distinct values of `k` for which `G` contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate \"Induced Clique\" to \"Clique\"\nThe question requires us to find `k`'s for which there is an \"induced subgraph\" that is a clique `K_k`. Let's analyze what this means.\nFor a subset of `k` vertices, let's call it `S_k`, to induce a clique `K_k`, the subgraph `G[S_k]` must be a complete graph. By definition of an induced subgraph, `G[S_k]` contains exactly all the edges of `G` that connect vertices within `S_k`. For `G[S_k]` to be a `K_k`, it must be that every pair of vertices in `S_k` is connected by an edge in `G`. This is precisely the definition of the set `S_k` being a clique in the graph `G`.\nTherefore, the statement \"G has an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`\" is equivalent to the statement \"G contains a clique of size `k`\".\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Set of Possible Clique Sizes in a Graph\nLet `C(G)` be the set of all integers `k` such that graph `G` contains a clique of size `k`. We want to find a graph `G` on 128 vertices for which `|C(G)|` is maximum.\n\nLet's consider the properties of the set `C(G)`. Suppose a graph `G` contains a clique of size `k`, where `k > 1`. Let this clique be formed by the vertex set `S_k`. If we remove any single vertex from `S_k`, the remaining `k-1` vertices still form a clique, because they are all mutually connected. This means that if `k ∈ C(G)` and `k > 1`, then `(k-1) ∈ C(G)`.\n\nThis observation implies that the set `C(G)` must consist of a consecutive sequence of integers starting from 1. If the largest clique in `G` has size `m`, then `G` must also have cliques of size `m-1, m-2, ..., 2, 1`. The size of the largest clique in a graph `G` is called the **clique number**, denoted `ω(G)`.\nSo, for any graph `G`, the set of clique sizes is `C(G) = {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`.\nThe number of different clique sizes is therefore `|C(G)| = ω(G)`.\n\n### Step 4: Rephrase the Problem\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, the problem of maximizing the number of different clique sizes is equivalent to maximizing the clique number `ω(G)`. The question can now be rephrased as:\n\"What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices?\"\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Rephrased Problem\nThe clique number of a graph `G` on `n` vertices, `ω(G)`, represents the size of a subset of vertices. Therefore, the size of the largest clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph.\nSo, for any graph `G` with `n=128` vertices, `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n\nThe final part is to determine if this upper bound can be achieved. We can construct a graph `G` that has a clique number of 128. The simplest such graph is the **complete graph** `K_{128}`.\nIn `K_{128}`, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. The set of all 128 vertices itself forms a clique of size 128. Thus, for `G = K_{128}`, `ω(G) = 128`.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nSince we have established:\n1.  The maximum number of clique sizes is equal to the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`.\n2.  `ω(G)` is at most 128 for a graph with 128 vertices.\n3.  The value `ω(G) = 128` is achievable with the complete graph `K_{128}`.\n\nFor the graph `G = K_{128}`, the clique number is 128. This means `G` has cliques of sizes `1, 2, 3, ..., 128`. The set of different clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the number of such sizes is 128. This is the maximum possible number."
