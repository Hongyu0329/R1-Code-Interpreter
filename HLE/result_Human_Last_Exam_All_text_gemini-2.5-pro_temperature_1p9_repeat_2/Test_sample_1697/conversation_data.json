    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   **\"benzamide\"**: A benzene ring attached to an amide group (-CONH2).\n    *   **\"N,N-diethyl\"**: Two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, making it -CON(CH2CH3)2. This group is located at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n    *   **\"3-dimethylamino\"**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is attached to the 3-position (meta-position) of the benzene ring relative to the amide group.\n\n    The structure of the starting material is:\n    ```\n          C(=O)N(C2H5)2\n         /\n      (H)-C\n         / \\\n        C   C--N(CH3)2\n       |   |\n       C---C-(H)\n           \\ /\n            (H)\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagents (First Reaction):**\n    *   **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium):** This is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary role in this context is to deprotonate the most acidic proton.\n    *   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** This is a bidentate chelating ligand. It coordinates to the lithium ion (Li+), breaking up the aggregates of sec-BuLi and significantly increasing its basicity and reactivity.\n    *   **THF (tetrahydrofuran):** This is the aprotic polar solvent for the reaction.\n\n*   **Reagent (Second Reaction):**\n    *   **Methyl iodide (CH3I):** This is an electrophile. The carbon atom in the methyl group is susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction (Deprotonation/Lithiation)**\n\n*   The reaction of an aromatic compound containing a suitable directing group with a strong base like sec-BuLi/TMEDA is known as **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. The base selectively removes a proton from the position ortho (adjacent) to the directing group.\n*   In N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, there are two potential **Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs)** on the benzene ring:\n    1.  The **N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt2)** at position C1. This is an extremely powerful DMG that directs lithiation to its ortho positions (C2 and C6).\n    2.  The **dimethylamino group (-NMe2)** at position C3. This is also a strong DMG that directs lithiation to its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** We need to determine which proton will be removed.\n    *   The proton at C2 is ortho to *both* the amide group and the amino group.\n    *   The proton at C6 is only ortho to the amide group.\n    *   The proton at C4 is only ortho to the amino group.\n*   The C2 position is activated by both directing groups. This cooperative effect makes the proton at C2 the most acidic proton on the ring. The lithiation at C2 is highly favored because the resulting lithium intermediate is stabilized by chelation with both the oxygen of the amide group and the nitrogen of the amino group, forming a stable six-membered ring structure.\n*   Therefore, sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C2 position to form a lithiated intermediate: 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction (Electrophilic Quench)**\n\n*   The lithiated intermediate formed in the first step is a powerful nucleophile (an organolithium compound, which behaves like a carbanion).\n*   This nucleophile is then reacted with an electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I).\n*   The nucleophilic carbon atom at the C2 position of the ring attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the methyl group in an SN2-type reaction. The iodide ion (I-) is displaced as the leaving group.\n*   This step results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between the C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\n\n*   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, a methyl group is introduced at the C2 position.\n*   The structure of the final product is:\n    ```\n          C(=O)N(C2H5)2\n         /\n      (CH3)-C\n         / \\\n        C   C--N(CH3)2\n       |   |\n       C---C-(H)\n           \\ /\n            (H)\n    ```\n*   The systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide**. It can also be referred to as **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Strength of Directing Groups:** The N,N-dialkylamide group is one of the most powerful known directed metalation groups, stronger than the dialkylamino group. Even without the cooperative effect, it would preferentially direct lithiation.\n2.  **Cooperative Chelation:** The key to the high selectivity of this reaction is the synergistic effect of the two directing groups, both activating the same position (C2) and stabilizing the resulting intermediate through chelation.\n3.  **Role of TMEDA:** TMEDA is crucial for enhancing the reactivity of sec-BuLi. Without it, the reaction would be much slower and potentially less selective.\n4.  **Nature of Electrophile:** Methyl iodide is a simple, unhindered electrophile, ensuring a clean and efficient reaction with the organolithium nucleophile.\n\nThe final compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
