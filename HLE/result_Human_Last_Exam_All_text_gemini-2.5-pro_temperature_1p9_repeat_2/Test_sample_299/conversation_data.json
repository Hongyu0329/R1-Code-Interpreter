    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis of the function `f`\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** We first check if $f$ is an injective (one-to-one) function.\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying the function $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$.\n    Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, it is injective. Thus, $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** It is a standard theorem in real analysis that any continuous injective function defined on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nWe will analyze these two cases separately.\n\n### Step 2: Case 1 - `f` is strictly decreasing\nIf $f$ is a strictly decreasing function, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is a strictly increasing function. (Applying a decreasing function reverses order, applying it twice restores the order).\nThe function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, so this case is potentially possible.\n\nLet's analyze the range of the functions.\nSince $f$ is a continuous and strictly decreasing function defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, its limits at $\\pm\\infty$ exist (possibly as $\\pm\\infty$).\nLet $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = M$.\nSince $f$ is decreasing, we have $L < M$. The range of $f$ is the open interval $I = (L, M)$.\n\nThe equation is $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. The range of $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$.\nThe range of the left-hand side, $f(f(x))$, is the image of the range of $f$ under $f$, which is $f(I)$.\nSo, we must have $f(I) = (0, \\infty)$.\n$I = (L, M)$, so $f((L, M)) = (0, \\infty)$.\nSince $f$ is strictly decreasing, the image of the interval $(L, M)$ is $(\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y))$.\nSo, we have:\n*   $\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y) = 0$. Since $f$ is a decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its limit can be $0$ only as the argument approaches $+\\infty$. This implies $M=+\\infty$.\n*   $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = \\infty$. Since $f$ is a decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its limit can be $+\\infty$ only as the argument approaches $-\\infty$. This implies $L=-\\infty$.\n\nThese two conditions tell us about the original limits of $f$:\n*   $M = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n*   $L = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n\nThis means that $f$ is a strictly decreasing bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe range of $f$ is $I = (-\\infty, \\infty) = \\mathbb{R}$.\nNow we re-calculate the range of $f(f(x))$. It is $f(I) = f(\\mathbb{R})$.\nSince the range of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, the range of $f(f(x))$ is also $\\mathbb{R}$.\nHowever, the range of $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$.\nThe equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ thus leads to the conclusion $\\mathbb{R} = (0, \\infty)$, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, there are **no strictly decreasing** continuous functions that satisfy the given equation.\n\n### Step 3: Case 2 - `f` is strictly increasing\nIf $f$ is a strictly increasing function, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing. Since $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, this case is consistent.\n\nLet's analyze the range of $f$.\nLet the range of $f$ be the interval $I$. Since $f$ is continuous and increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$, $I$ is an open interval, say $I = (L, M)$, where $L = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ and $M = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$.\nThe range of $f(f(x))$ is $f(I)$, and the range of $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. Thus, $f(I)=(0, \\infty)$.\n$I=(L, M)$, so $f((L, M)) = (0, \\infty)$.\nSince $f$ is strictly increasing, the image of $(L, M)$ is $(\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y))$.\nThis implies:\n*   $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = 0$.\n*   $\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y) = \\infty$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies $M=\\infty$.\n\nSo, the range of $f$ is $I=(L, \\infty)$ for some $L \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{-\\infty\\}$.\nCould $L = -\\infty$? If $L=-\\infty$, the range of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$. Then the range of $f(f(x))$ would be $f(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$, which again contradicts the range of $\\exp(x)$ being $(0, \\infty)$.\nSo, $L$ must be a finite real number.\n\nWe have an increasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to (L, \\infty)$.\nThis means $f(x) > L$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSince $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $L$ is in the domain of $f$. So we can evaluate $f(L)$. We must have $f(L) > L$.\nFrom $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = 0$ and the continuity of $f$, we can conclude that $f(L) = 0$.\nSubstituting this into the inequality, we get $0 > L$. So $L$ must be a negative number.\n\nWe can find more specific values. From the original equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, let's set $x=L$:\n$f(f(L)) = \\exp(L)$.\nSince $f(L)=0$, this becomes $f(0) = \\exp(L)$.\nThis is consistent. As $L<0$, we have $\\exp(L) \\in (0, 1)$. And since $f$ is increasing and $L<0$, we must have $f(L) < f(0)$, which means $0 < f(0)$, consistent with $f(0)=\\exp(L)$.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Solutions and finding the Cardinality\nIt turns out that for any choice of $L<0$, we can construct solutions. A solution $f$ is uniquely determined by its behavior on a 'base' interval, for example, $[L, 0]$.\n\nLet's fix a value for $L < 0$.\nLet's choose an arbitrary strictly increasing continuous bijection (a homeomorphism) $h: [L, 0] \\to [f(L), f(0)] = [0, \\exp(L)]$.\nWe define $f(x) = h(x)$ for $x \\in [L, 0]$. This is our \"seed\" for the function.\n\nThe function $f$ for other values of $x$ is now determined by the equation $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$.\n*   For $x \\in [0, \\exp(L)]$: We can write $x = h(t) = f(t)$ for a unique $t \\in [L, 0]$. Then we must define $f(x) = f(f(t)) = \\exp(t) = \\exp(h^{-1}(x))$. This defines $f$ on $[0, \\exp(L)]$.\n*   For $x < L$: Let $y=f(x)$. Since $f$ is increasing, $y < f(L) = 0$. Since Range(f) = $(L, \\infty)$, we also have $y>L$. So $y \\in (L, 0)$. Then $f(y)=f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. On $(L,0)$, we have $f(y)=h(y)$, so $h(y)=\\exp(x)$. This implies we must define $f(x) = y = h^{-1}(\\exp(x))$.\n*   For $x > 0$: The function is defined recursively. For instance on $[\\exp(L), 1]$, $f(x) = \\exp(f^{-1}(x))$. $f^{-1}$ on this interval is determined by the values of $f$ on $[0, \\exp(L)]$, and so on.\n\nThis construction process shows that for any choice of $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ and any choice of a homeomorphism $h: [L, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(L)]$, we get a valid continuous strictly increasing solution $f$.\n\nNow we find the cardinality of the set of these functions.\n1.  **Freedom in choosing `L`:** The value $L$ can be any negative real number. The set of possible values for $L$ is $(-\\infty, 0)$, which has cardinality $c = |\\mathbb{R}|$ (the cardinality of the continuum). Different values of $L$ lead to different functions, since $f_L(L)=0$.\n\n2.  **Freedom in choosing `h`:** For any fixed $L<0$, we can choose the homeomorphism $h: [L, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(L)]$. The set of all such homeomorphisms is known to have cardinality $c$. For example, for any $\\alpha > 0$, the function $h(x) = \\exp(L) \\left(\\frac{x-L}{-L}\\right)^\\alpha$ is a valid homeomorphism. There are $c$ choices for $\\alpha$.\n\nSince there are $c$ choices for $L$, and for each such choice there are $c$ choices for the function $h$, the total number of solutions seems to be $c \\times c = c$.\n\nTo be more rigorous, we can establish a lower bound and an upper bound on the cardinality.\n*   **Lower Bound:** Let's fix the choice of $h$ to be the simple linear map $h_L(x) = \\frac{\\exp(L)}{-L} (x-L)$. For each choice of $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$, we get a distinct function $f_L$. The function $f_L$ has the property that $f_L(L)=0$. If $L_1 \\ne L_2$, then $f_{L_1}$ and $f_{L_2}$ have different roots, so they are different functions. This gives us an injection from $(-\\infty, 0)$ into our set of solutions. Thus, the cardinality of the set of solutions is at least $|(-\\infty, 0)| = c$.\n*   **Upper Bound:** The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $c$. (A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a countable dense set like $\\mathbb{Q}$. The set of all functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = c^{\\aleph_0} = c$). The set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, so its cardinality is at most $c$.\n\nSince the cardinality of the set of solutions is at least $c$ and at most $c$, it must be exactly $c$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ consists only of strictly increasing functions. The construction of these functions depends on the choice of a parameter $L<0$ and a homeomorphism $h$ on the interval $[L,0]$, leading to a family of solutions. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $c$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
