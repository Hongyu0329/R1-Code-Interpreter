    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The task is to take a string representing a sum of numbers (e.g., \"3+2+1+4+2\") and reorder the numbers to be in non-decreasing (sorted) order, then print the new sum (e.g., \"1+2+2+3+4\").\n2.  **Input Constraints:** The input is a string `s` containing only the digits '1', '2', '3', '4', and the '+' character. The string is non-empty and has a maximum length of 1000 characters.\n3.  **Output Requirements:** Print the new sum with the numbers sorted.\n4.  **Core Challenge:** The question specifically asks for the **most memory-efficient C program** and to calculate `m`, the total memory in bytes used for its variables.\n\n---\n\n### Listing Careful Points and Algorithm Selection\n\nTo achieve maximum memory efficiency, we must be very deliberate about our algorithm and data types.\n\n1.  **Avoiding a Large Buffer:** Storing the entire input string of up to 1000 characters would require a buffer of `char s[1001]`, which is over 1000 bytes. A more memory-efficient approach would be to process the input character-by-character without storing the whole string.\n\n2.  **Choosing the Right Algorithm:**\n    *   A generic sorting algorithm (like quicksort or merge sort) would require storing all the numbers in an array first. The maximum number of summands is 500 (e.g., \"1+1+...+1\" with 500 '1's and 499 '+'s has a length of 999). An array `int numbers[500]` would take `500 * 4 = 2000` bytes, which is not efficient.\n    *   **Counting Sort** is the perfect algorithm here. Since the numbers are limited to a very small range (1, 2, 3, 4), we can simply count the occurrences of each number. This avoids storing all the numbers.\n\n3.  **Implementing Memory-Efficient Counting Sort:**\n    *   We will read the input stream one character at a time using `getchar()`.\n    *   We need counters for '1', '2', '3', and '4'. Let's call them `count1`, `count2`, etc., or use an array `counts[4]`.\n    *   After counting, we will construct the output string by printing the required number of '1's, then '2's, and so on, separated by '+'.\n\n4.  **Selecting Minimal Data Types:** To minimize memory, we must use the smallest possible data type for each variable. We assume standard C data type sizes on a typical 32/64-bit system: `sizeof(char) = 1` byte, `sizeof(short) = 2` bytes, `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n    *   **Input Character:** `getchar()` returns an `int` so it can represent all possible `char` values plus the special `EOF` value. We must use `int` for this.\n    *   **Counters:** A string of length 1000 can have at most 500 numbers. So, a counter can reach a value of 500. A `char` (max value 127 or 255) is too small. A `short` (max value 32767) is sufficient. So we'll use an array of `short`.\n    *   **Loop Variables:** For printing, we will need a nested loop. The outer loop runs 4 times (for numbers 1-4), so a `char` is sufficient for its counter. The inner loop runs up to the count of each number (max 500), so its counter must be a `short`.\n    *   **Printing Flag:** To correctly print the '+' sign (not before the first number), a simple flag is needed. This flag can be 0 or 1, so a `char` is the perfect size.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition: Step-by-Step Memory Calculation\n\nBased on the chosen algorithm and data types, we can calculate the total memory used for variables.\n\n1.  **Counters Variable:** An array to store the counts of the four numbers (1, 2, 3, 4). As determined, each count requires a `short`.\n    *   `short counts[4];`\n    *   Memory = `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Input Character Variable:** A variable to hold the return value of `getchar()`. This must be an `int`.\n    *   `int ch;`\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(int)` = `1 * 4` = **4 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Loop Counter Variables:** One counter for the outer loop (numbers 1-4) and one for the inner loop (up to the count).\n    *   `char i;` (for the outer loop from 0 to 3)\n    *   `short j;` (for the inner loop, up to 500)\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char) + sizeof(short)` = `1 + 2` = **3 bytes**.\n\n4.  **Printing Flag Variable:** A flag to manage the printing of the `+` character.\n    *   `char first_term_flag;`\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n5.  **Total Memory (`m`):** Summing up the memory for all variables.\n    *   `m = (memory for counts) + (memory for ch) + (memory for loop counters) + (memory for flag)`\n    *   `m = 8 + 4 + 3 + 1`\n    *   `m = 16` bytes.\n\nThis represents the total memory allocated for variables on the stack in the most memory-efficient C implementation of the solution.\n\n<<<16>>>"
