    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the polynomial**\n\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. We look for a special structure. Consider the substitution $x = u+v$. We can express powers of $x$ in terms of $u$ and $v$. A known identity relates this to Chebyshev-like polynomials: if one imposes the condition $uv=C$ (for a constant C), the expression $u^n+v^n$ can be written as a polynomial in $x$.\nLet's try to make $f(x)-22$ equal to $u^7+v^7$ for some condition $uv=C$.\nThe expression $S_n(x) = u^n+v^n$ where $x=u+v$ and $uv=C$ follows the recurrence $S_n = x S_{n-1} - C S_{n-2}$.\nLet's set $C=2$.\n$S_1 = x$\n$S_2 = x^2 - 2(2) = x^2-4$\n$S_3 = x(x^2-4)-2x = x^3-6x$\n$S_4 = x(x^3-6x)-2(x^2-4) = x^4-8x^2+8$\n$S_5 = x(x^4-8x^2+8)-2(x^3-6x) = x^5-10x^3+20x$\n$S_6 = x(x^5-10x^3+20x)-2(x^4-8x^2+8) = x^6-12x^4+36x^2-16$\n$S_7 = x(x^6-12x^4+36x^2-16)-2(x^5-10x^3+20x) = x^7-14x^5+56x^3-56x$.\nThis is exactly the non-constant part of $f(x)$. So, $f(x) = S_7(x) + 22$.\nThe roots of $f(x)=0$ must therefore satisfy the system of equations:\n1.  $x = u+v$\n2.  $uv = 2$\n3.  $u^7+v^7 = -22$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the form of the roots**\n\nFrom the system, $u^7$ and $v^7$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $z^2 - (u^7+v^7)z + (u^7v^7) = 0$.\nSubstituting the values, we get $z^2 - (-22)z + (2)^7 = 0$, which simplifies to $z^2 + 22z + 128 = 0$.\nThe roots are $z = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{22^2 - 4(128)}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 512}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{-28}}{2} = -11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$.\nLet $\\omega = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$. Let $u_0$ be any specific 7-th root of $\\omega$. So $u_0^7 = \\omega$.\nFor $v_0$, we need $v_0^7 = -11 - i\\sqrt{7} = \\bar{\\omega}$ and $u_0 v_0 = 2$.\nLet's check consistency. The set of all 7th roots of $\\bar{\\omega}$ is $\\{ \\bar{u_0}\\zeta_7^j \\}_{j=0}^6$, where $\\zeta_7 = e^{2\\pi i/7}$. We must select the one which satisfies $u_0 v_0 = 2$. Note that $|u_0|^2 = u_0\\bar{u_0} = |\\omega|^{2/7} = (\\sqrt{121+7})^{2/7} = (\\sqrt{128})^{2/7} = (2^{7/2})^{2/7} = 2$. So if we choose $v_0 = \\bar{u_0}$, then $u_0 v_0 = 2$ is satisfied, and $v_0^7 = (\\bar{u_0})^7 = \\overline{u_0^7} = \\bar{\\omega}$ is also satisfied. So we can set $v_0 = \\bar{u_0}$.\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are of the form $u+v$. Let $u$ be any 7th root of $\\omega$, $u=u_0\\zeta_7^k$. Then $v=2/u = 2/(u_0\\zeta_7^k) = v_0\\zeta_7^{-k}$. The roots are therefore:\n$x_k = u_0\\zeta_7^k + v_0\\zeta_7^{-k}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 6$.\nWe can verify that these 7 roots are distinct.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of f(x)**\n\nLet $G$ be the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This group acts on the set of roots $\\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_6\\}$. The splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(x_0, \\dots, x_6)$. The roots are constructed from $u_0$ and $\\zeta_7$, so $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(u_0, \\zeta_7)$. In fact, one can show $K=\\mathbb{Q}(u_0, \\zeta_7)$.\n\nThe structure of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(u_0, \\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q})$ can be analyzed by the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(u_0, \\zeta_7)$.\n1.  The extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois with group $\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order 6, let's call it $C_6$. An element of this group is specified by $\\sigma_c(\\zeta_7) = \\zeta_7^c$ for $c \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\n2.  The extension $\\mathbb{Q}(u_0, \\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ is obtained by adjoining $u_0$, a root of $y^7-\\omega=0$, where $\\omega = -11+i\\sqrt{7} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ (since $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{7})$ is the unique quadratic subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$). This is a Kummer extension. One can show that $\\omega$ is not a 7-th power in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$, so the extension has degree 7 and the Galois group is $C_7$. Its generator $\\tau$ acts as $\\tau(u_0) = u_0\\zeta_7$.\n\nThe full Galois group $G$ is a semidirect product $C_7 \\rtimes C_6$. This group is known as the general affine group of degree 1 over $\\mathbb{F}_7$, denoted $\\text{AGL}(1,7)$. Its elements can be viewed as pairs $(c, d)$ where $c \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ and $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$, acting on the set $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$ via the transformation $k \\mapsto ck+d$. The order of $G$ is $7 \\times 6 = 42$.\nThe action of $G$ on the roots $x_k$ can be identified with this action on the indices $k$. For instance, the element $\\tau$ corresponds to $(c,d)=(1,1)$, giving $k \\mapsto k+1$, which cycles the roots: $\\tau(x_k)=x_{k+1}$. An element $\\sigma_c$ lifting from $\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q})$ acts as $k \\mapsto ck$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem**\n\nThe Chebotarev Density Theorem states that for a Galois extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, the natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which the Frobenius element Frob$_p$ belongs to a given conjugacy class $C \\subset G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is $|C|/|G|$.\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ if and only if the Frobenius element at $p$, Frob$_p$, acts as a single large cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. Since there are 7 roots, this means Frob$_p$ must be a 7-cycle.\nSo we need to find the proportion of elements in $G=\\text{AGL}(1,7)$ that are 7-cycles.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of 7-cycles in AGL(1,7)**\n\nAn element of $\\text{AGL}(1,7)$ is a permutation $\\pi_{c,d}$ of $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ defined by $\\pi_{c,d}(k) = ck+d$, where $c \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}=\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\nFor a permutation to be a 7-cycle, it must not have any fixed points. A fixed point $k$ satisfies the equation $k = ck+d$.\nThis can be rewritten as $(1-c)k = d \\pmod 7$.\nLet's analyze this equation:\n*   If $c \\neq 1$, then $(1-c)$ is a non-zero element of $\\mathbb{F}_7$ and hence has a multiplicative inverse. Thus, there is a unique solution for $k$, namely $k = (1-c)^{-1}d$. This means any permutation with $c \\neq 1$ has exactly one fixed point. Such a permutation is not a 7-cycle. There are $5 \\times 7 = 35$ such elements.\n*   If $c=1$, the equation becomes $0 \\cdot k = d$, which simplifies to $0=d$.\n    *   If $d=0$, the equation is $0=0$, which is true for all $k$. This element is the identity permutation $(c=1, d=0)$, which has 7 fixed points.\n    *   If $d \\neq 0$, the equation is $0=d$, which is false. In this case, there are no fixed points.\nThe permutations with no fixed points are those with $c=1$ and $d \\neq 0$.\nThe values for $d$ can be $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. So there are 6 such permutations. These are the pure translations $k \\mapsto k+d$. Each of these is a 7-cycle.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the density**\n\nThe total number of elements in the Galois group $G = \\text{AGL}(1,7)$ is $|G|=42$.\nThe number of elements that are 7-cycles is 6.\nThe proportion of 7-cycles in $G$ is $\\frac{6}{42} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\nBy the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible $\\bmod p$ is this proportion.\n\nFinal Answer: The density is $1/7$.\n\n<<<1/7>>>"
