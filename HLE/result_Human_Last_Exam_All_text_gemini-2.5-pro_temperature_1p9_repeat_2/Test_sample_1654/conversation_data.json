    "Excellent question. The symbolism of Otchumyelov's coat is a central element in Chekhov's story \"The Chameleon,\" perfectly illustrating the police superintendent's vacillating and servile nature. Let's break down the analysis to find the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the analysis is to identify every distinct moment where Chekhov uses the coat (or overcoat/greatcoat) to describe Otchumyelov's state or a shift in his attitude. The description is not just about the coat's physical appearance, but more importantly, the action of putting it on or taking it off, which symbolizes his changing \"skin\" like a chameleon.\n\n**1. The Initial Presentation**\n*   **Description:** At the very beginning of the story, as Otchumyelov walks across the market square, he is described as \"wearing a new overcoat.\"\n*   **Symbolism:** This establishes his official status and authority. He is comfortable and fully \"dressed\" in his role as a police superintendent.\n\n**2. The First Shift: From Authority to Subservience**\n*   **Description:** When a voice in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to the powerful General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov becomes flustered and hot. He says to the policeman, \"'Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.'\"\n*   **Symbolism:** He is literally shedding his official, authoritarian skin to become more agreeable and subservient in case he is dealing with a person of high status.\n\n**3. The Second Shift: Back to Authority**\n*   **Description:** The policeman speculates that the dog is too shabby to be the General's. Otchumyelov's mood immediately changes back. He feels a \"chill\" and says, \"'Put my coat on, brother Yeldyrin... there's a wind getting up... I am shivery.'\"\n*   **Symbolism:** His authority is put back on. The \"chill\" he feels is the return of his stern, official demeanor now that he believes he is dealing with a commoner's stray dog.\n\n**4. The Third Shift: Back to Subservience Again**\n*   **Description:** Another person in the crowd confidently states that they recently saw a similar dog in the General's yard. Otchumyelov panics again. He says, \"'H'm... Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...'\"\n*   **Symbolism:** This is the most comical and telling repetition. He again sheds his authority at the mere possibility of offending someone important. His internal state is directly and physically manifested by the removal of the coat.\n\n**5. The Final Action: Restoring Authority**\n*   **Description:** Finally, the General's cook arrives and clarifies the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother. Otchumyelov's case is solved to his satisfaction. As he leaves the scene, Chekhov writes that \"Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat and walks away across the market-square.\"\n*   **Symbolism:** He wraps himself back up in his cloak of authority, now secure in his judgment. His chameleon-like changes are over, and he departs, fully restored to his official self.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"Description\":** In this story, a \"description\" of the coat is not just a physical adjective (like \"new\"). It primarily involves the symbolic *actions* of taking the coat on and off, as these actions describe the shifts in Otchumyelov's mentality.\n*   **Synonyms:** Chekhov uses the words \"overcoat,\" \"coat,\" and \"greatcoat\" in various translations to refer to the same garment. All instances should be counted.\n*   **Counting Method:** We are counting the number of distinct scenes or moments where the coat is mentioned as a key part of the action or description.\n\nBased on this analysis, there are five distinct moments where Chekhov describes the coat or its symbolic use.\n\n1.  Wearing the \"new overcoat.\"\n2.  Taking the coat off (first time).\n3.  Putting the coat back on.\n4.  Taking the coat off (second time).\n5.  Wrapping himself in his \"greatcoat\" at the end.\n\nTherefore, Chekhov described the coat 5 times to symbolize the shifts in Otchumyelov's character.\n\n<<<5>>>"
