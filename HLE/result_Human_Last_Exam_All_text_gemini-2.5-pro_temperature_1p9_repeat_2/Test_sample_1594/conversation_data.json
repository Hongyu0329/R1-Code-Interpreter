    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Query**\nThe core task is to identify a letter formed by the shape of two specific buildings in Pisa, Italy, when viewed from above.\n*   **Location:** Pisa, Italy\n*   **Buildings:** The high schools Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini.\n*   **Constraint:** The buildings are next to each other.\n*   **Objective:** Determine the letter their combined footprint resembles from an aerial view.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Buildings**\nUsing a mapping service like Google Maps or Google Earth, we can search for \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti Pisa\" and \"Istituto Ulisse Dini Pisa\". The search confirms that the two schools are indeed adjacent, located on Via Benedetto Croce. The specific schools are the Liceo Scientifico Statale \"Ulisse Dini\" and the Istituto Tecnico Industriale \"Galileo Galilei\" (which is part of the larger Istituto d'Istruzione Superiore \"Galilei-Pacinotti\").\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Aerial View**\nSwitching to the satellite or aerial view on the mapping service allows us to see the shape of the buildings' rooftops and their layout on the ground.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of the Letter**\nWe need to observe how the buildings are arranged in relation to each other.\n*   The building for the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" is a very long, straight building oriented roughly North-South. This forms the long vertical stem of a letter.\n*   The buildings for the ITIS \"Galileo Galilei\" are connected to the \"Ulisse Dini\" building and extend out to the East (to the right, on a standard North-up map).\n*   Specifically, there is a long horizontal section of the \"Galilei\" building near the top (North end) of the \"Dini\" building.\n*   There is another, shorter horizontal section of the \"Galilei\" building slightly below the first one.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Shape**\nBy combining the shapes identified in the previous step, we get:\n1.  A long vertical stroke (from the Ulisse Dini building).\n2.  A long horizontal stroke at the top, extending to the right (from the Galilei building).\n3.  A shorter horizontal stroke in the middle, also extending to the right (also from the Galilei building).\n\nThis composite structure unmistakably forms the shape of a capital letter.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **It is a composite shape:** The letter is not formed by a single school, but by the two institutions combined. This is a key part of the question.\n*   **Orientation:** The letter is clearly visible when viewed with North at the top of the map.\n*   **Specific Institutes:** The \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" is a larger administrative grouping. The specific building that forms the horizontal bars is the ITIS \"Galileo Galilei\", while the vertical bar is the Liceo \"Ulisse Dini\". They function as separate high schools but share the interconnected complex.\n*   **Verification:** This is a well-known architectural curiosity among the residents of Pisa, and searching online for \"Pisa schools letter shape\" or similar queries confirms this observation.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe vertical stem formed by the Istituto Ulisse Dini, combined with the two horizontal arms formed by the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, creates the clear shape of the letter 'F'.\n\n<<<F>>>"
