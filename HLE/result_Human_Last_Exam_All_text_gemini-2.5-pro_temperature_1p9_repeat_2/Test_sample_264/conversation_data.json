    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Set up a coordinate system for the first cube.**\nTo analyze the problem geometrically, we place the first cube, let's call it C1, in a standard Cartesian coordinate system. We can define C1 as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n`0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n`0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n`0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\nThis is a cube with side length 1, positioned with one corner at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its opposite corner at (1, 1, 1).\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift and define the second cube.**\nThe main diagonal of C1 connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **v** = (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe problem states that the second cube, C2, is shifted \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". This is typically interpreted to mean that the shift vector is 1/2 times the main diagonal vector.\nShift vector **S** = (1/2) * **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\nThe second cube, C2, is simply the first cube C1 translated by this shift vector **S**. To find the coordinates that define C2, we add the components of **S** to the coordinate bounds of C1:\nFor the x-coordinate: `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\nFor the y-coordinate: `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\nFor the z-coordinate: `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\nSo, C2 is defined as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n`1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n`1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n`1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Careful Point:** A less common interpretation would be that the magnitude (Euclidean distance) of the shift is 1/2. This would result in a shift vector with irrational components and a much more complex intersection. The interpretation used here is standard for such problems and leads to a clean solution.\n\n**Step 3: Find the region of intersection.**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the volume that is common to both C1 and C2. A point (x, y, z) lies in the intersection if it satisfies the inequalities for both cubes simultaneously. We can find the bounds of the intersection by taking the intersection of the corresponding coordinate intervals.\n\n*   **x-dimension:** The overlapping range for x is `[0, 1]` ∩ `[1/2, 3/2]`. This gives the interval `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **y-dimension:** The overlapping range for y is `[0, 1]` ∩ `[1/2, 3/2]`. This gives the interval `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **z-dimension:** The overlapping range for z is `[0, 1]` ∩ `[1/2, 3/2]`. This gives the interval `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nTherefore, the intersection is a smaller cube defined by:\n`1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n`1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n`1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe resulting shape of the intersection is a cube. We can calculate its side length for each dimension:\n*   Side length in x = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in y = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in z = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
