    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Numeral System**\nThe numbers in the equation are written using Babylonian cuneiform numerals. This is a sexagesimal (base-60) place-value system.\n\n*   The symbol `Y` (a downward wedge) represents the value 1.\n*   The symbol `<` (a leftward wedge) represents the value 10.\n*   Numbers from 1 to 59 are formed by combining these symbols.\n*   The positions of symbol groups represent powers of 60, increasing from right to left (..., 60², 60¹, 60⁰).\n\n**2. Decipher the First Number**\nThe first number is ` wymiwyg`. We need to convert it to modern (base-10) numbers.\n\n*   **Left Group (60¹ place):** This group contains four \"10\" symbols (`<<<<`). The value is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = **40**.\n*   **Right Group (60⁰ place):** This group contains one \"10\" symbol (`<`) and four \"1\" symbols (`YYYY`). The value is 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **14**.\n\nTo find the total value in base-10, we calculate:\n(40 × 60¹) + (14 × 60⁰) = (40 × 60) + (14 × 1) = 2400 + 14 = **2414**.\n\n**3. Decipher the Second Number**\nThe second number is `wysiwyg`. We will convert this number as well.\n\n*   **Left Group (60¹ place):** This group contains one \"10\" symbol (`<`) and one \"1\" symbol (`Y`). The value is 10 + 1 = **11**.\n*   **Right Group (60⁰ place):** This group also contains one \"10\" symbol (`<`) and one \"1\" symbol (`Y`). The value is 10 + 1 = **11**.\n\nTo find the total value in base-10, we calculate:\n(11 × 60¹) + (11 × 60⁰) = (11 × 60) + (11 × 1) = 660 + 11 = **671**.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nThe equation asks for the result of the first number minus the second number.\n\n2414 - 671\n\n**Calculation:**\n   2414\n-   671\n--------\n   1743\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correctly identify the base:** It's crucial to recognize the Babylonian system is base-60, not base-10.\n*   **Correctly interpret the symbols:** Distinguishing between the '1' symbol (`Y`) and the '10' symbol (`<`) is key.\n*   **Correctly identify the place values:** The groups of symbols are arranged by place value (powers of 60). The rightmost group is the units (60⁰) place, and the group to its left is the sixties (60¹) place.\n*   **Accurate conversion:** The conversion from base-60 to base-10 must be done correctly by multiplying each place's value by the corresponding power of 60 and summing the results.\n*   **Perform the final arithmetic:** The final subtraction must be carried out without error.\n\nFollowing these steps, the final answer is calculated to be 1743.\n\n<<<1743>>>"
