    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We need to find the splitting field $K$ of this polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let's try to factor $f(x)$. By rearranging the terms, we can see a common factor:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The roots of $f(x)$ are the union of the roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting field of $g(x)$ and the splitting field of $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their splitting fields**\n\n*   **For $h(x) = x^2 - 2$:** The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    *   **Irreducibility:** Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n        *   The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3.\n        *   All other coefficients (-9, 0, 0, 3) are divisible by 3.\n        *   The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n        Therefore, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois Group:** Let $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $K_g$ is the splitting field of $g(x)$. Since $g(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, $G_g$ is a subgroup of $S_5$ and its order is a multiple of 5. By Cauchy's theorem, $G_g$ contains an element of order 5 (a 5-cycle).\n    *   To determine the group more precisely, we find the number of real roots of $g(x)$. The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, so $x^4=9/5$, which yields two real critical points $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n        *   $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)^{1/4}(9/5) - 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}(9/5)^{1/4} < 0$.\n        *   $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = - (9/5)^{1/4}(9/5) + 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}(9/5)^{1/4} > 0$.\n        A local maximum is positive and a local minimum is negative, so $g(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and therefore 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    *   A theorem states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly $p-2$ real roots, its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$ and there are $3=5-2$ real roots, so $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) = S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5|=120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K over Q**\n\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = K_g K_h = K_g(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ fits into the standard framework for compositum of fields. We have $G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset K_g$. This would mean that $K_g$ contains a quadratic subfield. By Galois theory, a quadratic subfield corresponds to a subgroup of index 2 in the Galois group $S_5$. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. The fixed field of $A_5$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the polynomial $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$.\n\nThe discriminant is $D = (-1)^{5(4)/2}(5^5 \\cdot 3^{4} + (1-5)^4(-9)^5) = 1 \\cdot (3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049)) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nSince $D < 0$, the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field. However, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\not\\subset K_g$.\nTherefore, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis confirms that the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong G_g \\times G_h \\cong S_5 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times 2 = 120 \\times 2 = 240$. So $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal subfields**\n\nWe are looking for the possible degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ of field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ and $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension if and only if its corresponding Galois group, $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The degree of the extension is given by $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$. The conditions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ mean that we need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$, i.e., $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\n\nLet $C_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ must be determined.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nA known result in group theory states that if $G_1$ is a group with a trivial center (like $S_5$), then any normal subgroup of $G_1 \\times G_2$ is a product of a normal subgroup of $G_1$ and a normal subgroup of $G_2$. However, to be more rigorous, we can use Goursat's Lemma, which gives all subgroups. For normal subgroups, it simplifies. There are two types of normal subgroups for $S_5 \\times C_2$:\n\n1.  **Product Subgroups:** These are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd S_5$ and $N_2 \\unlhd C_2$.\n    *   $H_1 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_1|=60$. $[G:H_1] = 240/60 = 4$. This gives a degree of 4.\n    *   $H_2 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_2|=120$. $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$. This gives a degree of 2. (This subgroup fixes $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$).\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H_3|=2$. $[G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$. This gives a degree of 120. (This subgroup fixes $K_g$).\n    *   $H_4 = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H_4|=60 \\times 2=120$. $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$. This gives a degree of 2. (This subgroup fixes $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$).\n\n2.  **\"Diagonal\" or \"Skew\" Subgroups:** These arise when a quotient of a normal subgroup of $S_5$ is isomorphic to a quotient of a normal subgroup of $C_2$. The only non-trivial case is the isomorphism $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. This gives rise to one more normal subgroup:\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(s, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(s) = c\\}$, identifying $C_2$ with $\\{1, -1\\}$. This subgroup consists of pairs of (even permutation, identity) and (odd permutation, non-identity element).\n    *   $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    *   $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$. This gives another subfield of degree 2, namely $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D})$.\n\nThe trivial subgroups $H=\\{e\\}$ and $H=G$ correspond to $L=K$ (degree 240) and $L=\\mathbb{Q}$ (degree 1), respectively. These are not in the range $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n\nCombining the results, the possible indices for proper non-trivial normal subgroups are 2, 4, and 120. Each of these indices corresponds to the degree of a normal subfield $L$.\n\nThe possible degrees are therefore 2, 4, and 120.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Degree 2: e.g., $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension and $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subsetneq K$.\n*   Degree 4: e.g., $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D})$. This is a normal extension and $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n*   Degree 120: $L=K_g$. This is the splitting field of $g(x)$, so it's a normal extension, and $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq K_g \\subsetneq K$.\n\nAll the steps are verified. The list of possible degrees is complete.\n\n>>>\n2, 4, 120"
