    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". This line is an iambic senarius, a common meter in Roman comedy (the line is from Plautus, *Asinaria*, 495).\n\n### Step 1: Syllabification and Elision\nFirst, we break the line into syllables and identify any elisions.\nThe line is: `et ti bi be ne es se so li quom si bi sit ma le`\n\nThere is one clear elision:\n*   `bene esse`: The final short vowel `-e` of `bene` is elided before the initial vowel `e-` of `esse`.\nThis creates the sequence `ben' esse`.\n\nFor scanning purposes, this combination `ben'esse` is re-syllabified. The standard way to handle this is to treat it as `be-nes-se`.\n\n### Step 2: Determining Syllable Quantities (Long/L or Short/S)\nWe now determine the length of each syllable based on standard rules of Latin meter.\n*   A syllable is **long by nature** if its vowel is long (e.g., ā, ē, ī, ō, ū).\n*   A syllable is **long by position** if its short vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or by a \"double consonant\" (x, z).\n*   Otherwise, a syllable with a short vowel is **short**.\n*   **Brevis in longo**: The final syllable of a line can be treated as long regardless of its natural quantity.\n\nLet's apply these rules syllable by syllable:\n\n1.  `et`: Contains a short vowel `e`. It is followed by a single consonant (`t` of `tibi`). Therefore, it is **S** (short).\n2.  `ti-bi` (`tĭbĭ`): Both vowels are naturally short. They are followed by single consonants. So, both syllables are **S S** (short, short).\n3.  `be-ne es-se` -> `be-nes-se`:\n    *   `be-`: Contains a short `e` in an open syllable. It is **S** (short).\n    *   `nes-`: Contains a short `e` but is followed by the double consonant `-ss-`. This makes it long by position. It is **L** (long).\n    *   `-se`: Contains a short `e` and is followed by the single consonant `s-` of `soli`. It is **S** (short).\n    *   Thus, `bene esse` scans as **S L S**.\n4.  `so-li` (`sōlī`):\n    *   `so-`: The `o` in `solus` is naturally long. It is **L** (long).\n    *   `-li`: The `i` is short. It is **S** (short).\n5.  `quom` (`cum`): Contains a short vowel `u` and ends in `m`. The next word, `sibi`, begins with a consonant (`s`). The sequence `-m s-` counts as two consonants, making the syllable long by position. It is **L** (long).\n6.  `si-bi` (`sĭbĭ`): Both vowels are short. Both syllables are **S S** (short, short).\n7.  `sit`: Contains a short vowel `i` and ends in `t`. The next word, `male`, begins with a consonant (`m`). The sequence `-t m-` counts as two consonants, making the syllable long by position. It is **L** (long).\n8.  `ma-le` (`mălĕ`):\n    *   `ma-`: The `a` is short. It is **S** (short).\n    *   `-le`: The `e` is short, but as the final syllable of the line (*brevis in longo*), it is scanned as long. It is **L** (long).\n\n### Step 3: Assembling the sequence of quantities\nPutting all the quantities together, we get a sequence of 14 syllables:\nS S S S L S L S L S S L S L\n\n### Step 4: Parsing into Metrical Feet\nAn Iambic Senarius consists of six iambic feet (`S L`). However, Plautus frequently uses substitutions. A standard iamb (`S L`, two syllables) can be replaced by:\n*   A **tribrach** (`S S S`, three syllables)\n*   An **anapest** (`S S L`, three syllables)\n*   Other substitutions like a spondee (`L L`), dactyl (`L S S`), or proceleusmatic (`S S S S`).\n\nOur line has 14 syllables. A standard line has 12 (6 feet x 2 syllables). The extra two syllables indicate that two feet have been resolved into three-syllable feet (like a tribrach or anapest). Our task is to divide the 14-syllable sequence into six valid feet.\n\nLet's parse the sequence: `S S S S L S L S L S S L S L`\n\n1.  **Foot 1:** The first three syllables are `et ti bi` (`S S S`). This is a **tribrach**, a valid substitution for an iamb.\n2.  **Foot 2:** The next two syllables are `be nes-` (from `ben'esse`), which are `S L`. This is a standard **iamb**.\n3.  **Foot 3:** The next two syllables are `-se so-` (from `es-se so-li`), which are `S L`. This is another standard **iamb**.\n4.  **Foot 4:** The next two syllables are `-li quom`, which are `S L`. This is another standard **iamb**.\n5.  **Foot 5:** The next three syllables are `si bi sit`, which are `S S L`. This is an **anapest**, a valid substitution for an iamb.\n6.  **Foot 6:** The final two syllables are `ma le`, which are `S L`. This is a standard **iamb**.\n\nThis parsing accounts for all 14 syllables and uses valid metrical substitutions for an Iambic Senarius.\n\n### Final Scansion\n\nThe feet are as follows:\n*   Foot 1: `et tibi` -> S S S (Tribrach)\n*   Foot 2: `benesse` (part 1) -> S L (Iamb)\n*   Foot 3: `beneSse soli` (part 2+1) -> S L (Iamb)\n*   Foot 4: `soLI quom` -> S L (Iamb)\n*   Foot 5: `sibi sit` -> S S L (Anapest)\n*   Foot 6: `male` -> S L (Iamb)\n\nWe represent this with spaces between the feet.\n\n<<<S S S S L S L S L S S L S L>>>"
