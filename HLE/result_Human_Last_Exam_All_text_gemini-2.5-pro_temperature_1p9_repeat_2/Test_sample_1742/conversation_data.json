    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and Its Modules\nThe algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q$ of type $A_3$ with linear orientation.\n$Q: 1 \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\longrightarrow} 2 \\stackrel{\\beta}{\\longrightarrow} 3$.\nThis is a hereditary algebra of finite representation type. There are $\\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2} = 6$ indecomposable modules up to isomorphism.\nWe can denote an indecomposable module by $M_{i,j}$, which corresponds to a representation with vector spaces $\\mathbb{C}$ at vertices from $i$ to $j$ and 0 elsewhere, with identity maps between them. The 6 indecomposable modules are:\n*   $S_1 = M_{1,1}$: The simple module at vertex 1. Representation $(\\mathbb{C}, 0, 0)$.\n*   $S_2 = M_{2,2}$: The simple module at vertex 2. Representation $(0, \\mathbb{C}, 0)$.\n*   $S_3 = M_{3,3}$: The simple module at vertex 3. Representation $(0, 0, \\mathbb{C})$.\n*   $M_{1,2}$: Representation $(\\mathbb{C}, \\mathbb{C}, 0)$.\n*   $M_{2,3}$: Representation $(0, \\mathbb{C}, \\mathbb{C})$.\n*   $M_{1,3}$: Representation $(\\mathbb{C}, \\mathbb{C}, \\mathbb{C})$.\n\nThe indecomposable projective modules are:\n*   $P_1 = A e_1 = M_{1,3}$\n*   $P_2 = A e_2 = M_{2,3}$\n*   $P_3 = A e_3 = S_3$\n\nThe indecomposable injective modules are:\n*   $I_1 = D(e_1 A) = S_1$\n*   $I_2 = D(e_2 A) = M_{1,2}$\n*   $I_3 = D(e_3 A) = M_{1,3}$\n\nNotice that $P_1 = I_3 = M_{1,3}$ is a projective-injective module.\n\n### Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting Modules and Slice Modules\nFor a hereditary algebra like $A$, the notions of **tilting module** and **$\\tau$-tilting module** coincide. A module $T$ is a ($\\tau$-)tilting module if it satisfies:\n1.  The projective dimension of $T$ is at most 1 (always true for a hereditary algebra).\n2.  $Ext_A^1(T, T) = 0$.\n3.  $T$ has exactly $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable summands.\n\nA **slice** in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver $\\Gamma_A$ is a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of indecomposable modules that forms a specific type of section. A key property of a section is that for any two modules $X, Y \\in \\mathcal{S}$, there is no path of irreducible maps from $X$ to $Y$ in $\\Gamma_A$. A **slice module** is a module $T = \\bigoplus_{X \\in \\mathcal{S}} X$ where $\\mathcal{S}$ is a slice.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Potential Non-Slice Modules\nA theorem by Happel and Ringel states that for a hereditary algebra of finite representation type, every tilting module is a slice module, with the possible exceptions of the **projective tilting module** $A = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n P_i$ and the **injective tilting module** $I = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n I_i$. Let's examine these two candidates.\n\n1.  **The projective tilting module $A$:**\n    $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 = M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{2,3} \\oplus S_3$.\n    It is a tilting module because $A$ is projective, so $Ext_A^1(A,A)=0$, and it has 3 summands.\n    To check if it is a slice module, we examine the paths between its summands in the AR-quiver. The irreducible maps for this algebra include injections of the form $M_{i+1,j} \\to M_{i,j}$ and projections $M_{i,j+1} \\to M_{i,j}$. More standard are inclusions $M_{i,j} \\hookrightarrow M_{i, j+1}$ and $M_{i+1,j+1} \\hookrightarrow M_{i,j+1}$. Specifically, we have irreducible maps corresponding to inclusions of radical layers of the projectives:\n    $S_3 = P_3 = rad(M_{2,3})$. So there is an irreducible map $P_3 \\to P_2$.\n    $M_{2,3} = P_2 = rad(M_{1,3})$. So there is an irreducible map $P_2 \\to P_1$.\n    Thus, there is a path of irreducible maps $P_3 \\to P_2 \\to P_1$ in the AR quiver. A set of modules containing such a path cannot form a slice.\n    Therefore, $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ is not a slice module.\n\n2.  **The injective tilting module $I$:**\n    $I = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = S_1 \\oplus M_{1,2} \\oplus M_{1,3}$.\n    This is a tilting module because all its summands are injective (or have an injective resolution of length 0 or 1), so $Ext_A^1(I,I)=0$. It also has 3 summands.\n    Similarly, let's check for paths. The irreducible maps include epimorphisms onto the socle layers of the injectives.\n    There is an irreducible map $I_3 \\to I_2$ (projection $M_{1,3} \\to M_{1,2}$).\n    There is an irreducible map $I_2 \\to I_1$ (projection $M_{1,2} \\to S_1$).\n    So there is a path $I_3 \\to I_2 \\to I_1$ in the AR quiver.\n    Therefore, $I = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3$ is also not a slice module.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the \"Unique\" Module\nWe have identified two $\\tau$-tilting modules, $A$ and $I$, that are not slice modules. The question asks for a \"unique\" such module. The uniqueness must come from a special property distinguishing one from the other.\n\n*   The module $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ is the algebra $A$ itself, viewed as a left module. All of its indecomposable summands are projective modules.\n*   The module $I = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3$ has summands $S_1$ and $M_{1,2}$ which are not projective.\n\nThe property of being composed *entirely* of projective modules is unique to $A$. The module $A$ is the fundamental object in the module category, serving as the canonical or standard tilting module. All other tilting modules can be generated from it via sequences of mutations. Its role as the algebra itself is absolutely unique. Therefore, it is the most natural candidate for \"the unique\" non-slice $\\tau$-tilting module.\n\n<<<A>>>"
