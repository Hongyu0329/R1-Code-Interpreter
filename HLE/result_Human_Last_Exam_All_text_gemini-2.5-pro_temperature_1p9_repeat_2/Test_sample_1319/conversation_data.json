    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the *second tallest* real-world (\"historical\") mountain that is specifically named in Homer's *Iliad*.\n    *   **Primary Filter:** The mountain must be mentioned in the *Iliad*.\n    *   **Ranking Criterion:** The selection is based on height.\n    *   **Exclusion:** Mount Olympus is explicitly excluded from the final answer, as it is the tallest.\n\n2.  **Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***: First, we need a list of candidate mountains that Homer names in the epic poem.\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, frequently mentioned. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n    *   **Mount Ida:** A crucial location in the poem. Zeus often sits on its summit (Gargarus) to watch the Trojan War. This mountain is located near ancient Troy in modern-day Turkey.\n    *   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, Poseidon sits \"on the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace\" to watch the fighting. This is a real island in the northern Aegean Sea with a prominent mountain peak.\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned in the context of Achilles' great spear, which was cut from an ash tree on Mount Pelion's summit. This is a real mountain in Thessaly, Greece.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Lemnos, her journey takes her over the \"sheer peaks\" of Mount Athos. This is a real and prominent mountain in northern Greece.\n\n3.  **Find the Elevations of These Historical Mountains:** Now, we need the modern, accepted elevations for each mountain to rank them by height.\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** ~2,918 meters (9,573 feet)\n    *   **Mount Athos:** ~2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n    *   **Mount Ida (modern Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** ~1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** ~1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n    *   **Mount Samothrace (peak is Fengari):** ~1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n4.  **Rank the Mountains and Determine the Answer:** With the elevations, we can create a ranked list.\n    1.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m)\n    2.  **Mount Athos (2,033 m)**\n    3.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n    4.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n    5.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n\nThe question asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus. Based on this ranked list, the second tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Athos**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Plot vs. Mention:** Mount Ida is far more central to the plot of the *Iliad* than Mount Athos. It's easy to mistakenly assume Ida is the second-most prominent or second-tallest. However, the question is strictly about elevation, not narrative importance.\n*   **\"Historical Mountain\":** The question specifies \"historical,\" meaning a real, physical location. All the mountains listed above are real and can be visited today.\n*   **Verification of Mention:** It's crucial to confirm that each mountain is genuinely mentioned in the text. Mount Athos's mention, while brief (in Hera's travel itinerary), is clear and unambiguous in Book 14.\n*   **Two Mount Idas:** There is another famous Mount Ida in Crete, associated with the birth of Zeus. The one mentioned in the *Iliad* is the one in the Troad, near Troy. Its lower elevation compared to Athos is key to the answer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter compiling a list of all historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and comparing their modern elevations, we exclude Mount Olympus as the tallest. The next in height is Mount Athos.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
