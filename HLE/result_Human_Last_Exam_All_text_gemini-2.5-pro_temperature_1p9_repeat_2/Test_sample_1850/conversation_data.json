    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The user wants to know the number of \"historical saints\" that are \"mentioned by name\" in John Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*.\n\n2.  **Define \"Historical Saint\"**: This is a critical step. The term can be interpreted in two ways:\n    *   **Broadly**: Any revered holy person from history, including Biblical figures like Moses, Abraham, the Apostles (Peter, Paul), and the Virgin Mary, who are considered saints in various Christian traditions.\n    *   **Narrowly**: Post-Biblical figures who were later canonized or became recognized as saints by the established Christian Church (e.g., Catholic or Orthodox traditions). Examples include St. Augustine, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Dominic, etc.\n\n3.  **Consider Milton's Perspective**: John Milton was a devout Puritan with strong anti-Catholic and anti-establishment sentiments. He believed that the Church had become corrupted after the apostolic age. In his view, the veneration of saints, relics, and the authority of church traditions were \"superstitions\" that tainted the purity of scripture. This theological stance makes it highly improbable that Milton would mention post-Biblical saints in a reverent way. Any mention is likely to be critical or satirical.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Broad Interpretation (Biblical Figures)**:\n    *   *Paradise Lost* names many figures from the Old Testament, such as **Abel**, **Enoch**, **Noah**, **Abraham**, **Moses**, and **David**. These figures are considered saints in many Christian traditions.\n    *   However, key New Testament saints are conspicuously absent by name. The Virgin Mary is referred to only as \"a Virgin\" or \"his Mother\". The Apostles are mentioned as a group (\"his Apostles\"), but **Peter**, **Paul**, and **John** are not mentioned by their individual names.\n    *   If we were to count all named Old Testament figures who are also considered saints, the number would be significant (well over five). However, these individuals are typically categorized as patriarchs or prophets, and the term \"historical saints\" often implies figures from the era of the established Church, separate from Biblical history.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Narrow Interpretation (Post-Biblical Saints)**:\n    *   Given Milton's theology, we should look for references to saints associated with the Catholic Church, likely in a critical context.\n    *   There is one very specific passage in *Paradise Lost* that fits this description perfectly. In Book III, Milton describes the \"Limbo of Vanity\" or \"Paradise of Fools,\" a place where all futile and vain things end up. He uses this as an opportunity to satirize the Catholic Church.\n    *   In lines 478-480 of Book III, Milton writes about those who hope to get into heaven through superstitious means:\n        > ...and they who to be sure of Paradise\n        > Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**,\n        > Or in **Franciscan** think to pass disguised...\n    *   Here, Milton mentions two major historical saints by name, precisely in the critical context we would expect.\n\n6.  **Identify and Count the Saints Mentioned**:\n    *   **Saint Dominic**: The founder of the Dominican Order is mentioned directly by his name, \"Dominic.\"\n    *   **Saint Francis of Assisi**: He is mentioned via the adjectival form \"Franciscan,\" referring to his monastic order. In the context of the passage, \"Franciscan\" functions as a direct reference to the person of Francis, parallel to the name \"Dominic.\" It is an unambiguous reference to the saint through his legacy.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The most precise interpretation of the question, taking into account both the specific phrasing \"historical saints\" (implying post-Biblical figures) and Milton's known theological views, points to the satirical passage in Book III. Other potential candidates (Biblical figures) are either not named (the Apostles) or belong to a different category than what is usually meant by \"historical saints.\" Therefore, the count is based on the named founders of the mendicant orders.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Historical Saint\"**: The main challenge is interpreting this phrase. The context of Milton's work strongly favors the narrow definition (post-Biblical saints).\n*   **\"By Name\"**: This is a strict criterion. It excludes allusions where a name is not explicitly used, such as the reference to \"the Virgin\" for Mary or the description of a pro-Christian emperor for Constantine.\n*   **Adjectival Forms**: One must decide if \"Franciscan\" counts as mentioning \"Francis\" by name. Given the direct parallel with \"Dominic\" in the poetic structure, it is a valid and widely accepted interpretation that it does.\n\nFinal count based on the analysis: 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
