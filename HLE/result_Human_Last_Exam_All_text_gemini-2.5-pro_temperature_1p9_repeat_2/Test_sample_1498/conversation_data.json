    "Of course. Let's analyze the question and determine the exact range of verses (abyat) in the poem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the specific section within the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the names of the 25 prophets, whose mention is obligatory in the creed, are listed. We need to find the starting verse number and the ending verse number for this list.\n\n**2. Identify the Poem and its Structure**\nThe poem is *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* (The Creed of the Laymen) by Imam Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. It's a foundational poem in Ash'ari creed, structured thematically. It covers:\n*   The attributes of Allah (Ilahiyyat)\n*   The attributes and names of the Prophets (Nubuwwat)\n*   Belief in the Angels, Books, Last Day, etc. (Sam'iyyat)\n\nThe question concerns the *Nubuwwat* section.\n\n**3. Locate the Starting Point of the List**\nBefore listing the names, the author concludes the section on the *attributes* of the prophets (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence). He then introduces the list of names with a specific verse that sets the stage. This introductory verse is the true beginning of the section dedicated to listing the names.\n\nThe verse is:\nتَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\nكُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n*Tafṣīlu khamsatin wa ‘ishrīna lazim*\n*Kulla mukallafin faḥaqqiq waghtanim*\n\nTranslation: \"The details of twenty-five [prophets] are necessary for every legally responsible person, so verify [this] and seize the opportunity.\"\n\nThis verse explicitly states that the following verses will detail the 25 prophets. In the standard numbering of the poem, this is **bayt (verse) number 30**.\n\n**4. Locate the Ending Point of the List**\nWe now need to trace the verses that list the names until the list concludes.\n\n*   **Bayt 31:** `هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ ...` (They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud with...)\n*   **Bayt 32:** `لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ...` (Lut, and Isma'il, Ishaq as well...)\n*   **Bayt 33:** `شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ...` (Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and al-Yasa'...)\n*   **Bayt 34:** `إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى - عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا`\n    *Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa (Jesus), and **Taha** (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the **Final one**, leave misguidance.*\n\nThis final verse, **bayt number 34**, completes the list of 25 prophets by mentioning Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) using the names 'Taha' and 'Khatim' (the Seal/Final).\n\n**5. Verify the Verse Immediately After**\nTo be certain that the list has ended, let's examine the next verse (bayt 35):\n`عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ - وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ`\n*Translation: \"Upon them be prayers and peace, and upon their families, as long as the days last.\"*\nThis verse is a concluding prayer (*salawat*) for all the prophets just mentioned. It is not part of the list itself, but rather a conclusion to it. Therefore, the list of names definitively ends at bayt 34.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Start is an Introduction:** The section doesn't begin with the first prophet's name (Adam). It begins with bayt 30, which explicitly introduces the upcoming list of 25 prophets. This is the correct starting point of the specific section.\n2.  **Poetic Arrangement:** The names are not simply listed but are woven into the poem's meter and rhyme scheme, which is why they are spread across multiple couplets.\n3.  **Identification of the Final Prophet:** Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is mentioned last and identified by the honorifics \"Taha\" (طه) and \"Khatim\" (خَاتِمٌ - the Seal/Final), which confirms the end of the line of prophets.\n4.  **Distinguishing the List from the Prayer:** It's important to recognize that bayt 35, which offers peace and blessings upon the prophets, is a conclusion *to* the list, not a part *of* it. This solidifies bayt 34 as the end point.\n5.  **Standard Verse Numbering:** While minor variations can exist in different manuscripts or publications, the numbering from bayt 30 to 34 is the most widely recognized and standard for this section of the poem.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The section begins at the verse that introduces the list of 25 prophets, which is **bayt 30**.\n*   The section continues through the verses naming the prophets.\n*   The section concludes with the verse containing the last of the names, ending with Prophet Muhammad, which is **bayt 34**.\n\nTherefore, the names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt 30 to bayt 34, inclusive.\n\n<<<From bayt 30 to bayt 34.>>>"
