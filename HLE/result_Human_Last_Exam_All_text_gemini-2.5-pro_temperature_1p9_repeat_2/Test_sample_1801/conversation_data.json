    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify two specific individuals who meet a set of criteria:\n1.  They must be Nobel laureates.\n2.  They must have been featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n3.  The commercial must have been from the year 2000.\n4.  The commercial was part of the infamous \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Enron's Infamy:** The word \"infamous\" is key. The Enron scandal broke in late 2001. The 2000 commercial campaign occurred when Enron was at the peak of its perceived power and prestige, projecting an image of being an innovative, forward-thinking energy company. The campaign is infamous in retrospect because its tagline, \"Ask Why,\" became deeply ironic after the company's fraudulent practices were exposed. People should have, in fact, been \"asking why\" about its unbelievable profits.\n2.  **Timing of the Nobel Prize:** The question asks for \"Nobel laureates,\" which refers to their current status. It's important to verify if they were laureates *at the time the commercial was made* or if they received the prize later. This detail adds important context.\n3.  **Specific Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major branding effort by Enron. Identifying participants in this specific campaign is crucial, as they may have had other spokespeople at different times.\n4.  **Field of Expertise:** Given Enron's business, the Nobel laureates were likely to be from the field of Economics, which is a helpful clue for identifying them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Identify the Advertising Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a well-documented, high-profile television and print advertising campaign run by Enron in 2000, created by the agency Ogilvy & Mather.\n2.  **Search for Participants:** A search for participants in Enron's \"Ask Why\" campaign reveals several prominent figures. The task is to isolate the two who are Nobel laureates.\n3.  **Identify the First Laureate:** Research quickly points to **Paul Krugman**, a prominent economist and columnist. He appeared in one of the television spots. We must verify his Nobel laureate status.\n    *   **Verification:** Paul Krugman was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in **2008**. Therefore, while he is a Nobel laureate, he was not one in 2000 when the commercial was filmed. He fits the description of being \"a Nobel laureate featured\" in the ad.\n4.  **Identify the Second Laureate:** The same research into the campaign reveals another economist, **Myron Scholes**. He was also featured in the campaign, discussing financial markets.\n    *   **Verification:** Myron Scholes was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in **1997** (along with Robert C. Merton) for the Black-Scholes-Merton formula for options pricing. Therefore, he was already a Nobel laureate when he appeared in the Enron commercial in 2000. He also fits the description.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" ad campaign were Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes. Their participation has been widely cited as an example of how Enron successfully cultivated an image of intellectual legitimacy right before its collapse.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
