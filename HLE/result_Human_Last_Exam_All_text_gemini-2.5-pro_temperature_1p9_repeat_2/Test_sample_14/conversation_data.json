    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct unit.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Game:** BAR (Beyond All Reason)\n    *   **Unit Category:** Flying unit\n    *   **Building Tier:** Tier 1 (T1)\n    *   **Capability 1:** Can shoot (has an offensive weapon)\n    *   **Capability 2:** Its weapon can stun enemy targets\n\n2.  **Identify Factions and T1 Air Buildings:**\n    *   BAR has two primary factions: Armada (ARM) and Cortex (CORT).\n    *   Both factions can build a \"T1 Airplant\" to produce their respective T1 flying units.\n\n3.  **List and Analyze Armada (ARM) T1 Flying Units:**\n    *   **Peeper:** A scout plane. It is unarmed and cannot shoot. *Fails criteria.*\n    *   **Freedom Fighter:** An air-to-air fighter. It shoots lasers at other aircraft but has no ground attack and its weapon does not stun. *Fails criteria.*\n    *   **Thunder:** A tactical bomber. It drops bombs on ground targets. These bombs deal damage but do not have a stun effect. *Fails criteria.*\n    *   **Slasher:** A gunship. It has a plasma cannon for attacking ground units. This weapon deals damage but does not stun. *Fails criteria.*\n    *   **Skeeter:** A light gunship. It fires rockets at ground targets. These rockets deal damage but do not stun. *Fails criteria.*\n    *   **Conclusion for Armada:** No Armada T1 flying unit has a stunning weapon.\n\n4.  **List and Analyze Cortex (CORT) T1 Flying Units:**\n    *   **Nighthawk:** A scout plane. It is unarmed and cannot shoot. *Fails criteria.*\n    *   **Vampire:** An air-to-air fighter. It shoots lasers at other aircraft, similar to the Armada Fighter, and its weapon does not stun. *Fails criteria.*\n    *   **Shadow:** A tactical bomber. It drops bombs on ground targets. These bombs deal damage but do not have a stun effect. *Fails criteria.*\n    *   **Wasp:** A gunship. It fires rockets at ground targets. The rockets deal damage but do not stun. *Fails criteria.*\n    *   **Liche:** An EMP (Electro-Magnetic Pulse) gunship. It fires a special projectile that deals light damage, drains energy, and temporarily stuns enemy units, causing them to stop moving and firing. This unit perfectly matches all criteria.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing \"Stun\" from Damage:** Many units can attack (shoot), but the \"stun\" ability is a specific type of crowd control, usually associated with EMP or paralyzer weapons.\n*   **Faction Differences:** The unit roster is asymmetrical. A unit with a specific capability in one faction may not have a direct counterpart in the other.\n*   **Unit Roles:** It's important to understand the intended role of each unit. Fighters for air control, bombers for area damage, gunships for direct fire support, and specialized units like the Liche for utility (stunning).\n*   **Tier Level:** The question specifically asks for a Tier 1 unit. There are other flying units with stun capabilities at higher tiers (like the Armada EMP bomber, Thor), but the Liche is the only one at T1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the T1 flying units for both factions, we can conclude that only one unit fits the description. The Cortex Liche is a T1 flying unit from the T1 Airplant that shoots an EMP projectile, which stuns enemy targets.\n\n<<<Liche>>>"
