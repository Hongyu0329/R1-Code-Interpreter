The edges in the image will be smoothed, with sharp corners rounding off. Regions with convex boundaries will shrink, while regions with concave boundaries will fill in. Over many iterations ($t \rightarrow \infty$), this leads to the shrinking and eventual disappearance of any closed objects or features. The total length of the boundaries decreases, leading to a simplified image, often becoming a single uniform color. In essence, the edges either straighten out or are eliminated entirely.
