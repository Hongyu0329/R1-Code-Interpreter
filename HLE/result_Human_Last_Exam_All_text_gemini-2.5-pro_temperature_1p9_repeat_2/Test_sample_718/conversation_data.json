    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and Defining Terms\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the question and define them precisely.\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) $(J, \\le)$ in which any two elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$ have a least upper bound, also known as a supremum or join, denoted $j_1 \\vee j_2$. When viewed as a category, the objects are the elements of $J$, and there is a unique morphism from $j_1$ to $j_2$ if and only if $j_1 \\le j_2$. The semilattice property implies that for any two objects $j_1, j_2$, there is a diagram $j_1 \\to j_1 \\vee j_2 \\leftarrow j_2$.\n\n*   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**: This is a map from the category $J$ to the category of vector spaces over a field $K$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\le j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ to each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, in a way that respects composition and identities. Such a functor is also called a **representation** of the poset $J$.\n\n*   **$n$-resolvable**: A functor (or more generally, an object in an abelian category) $f$ is said to be **$n$-resolvable** if it admits a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence of the form:\n    $$0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. The smallest such $n$ for which a resolution exists is called the **projective dimension** of $f$.\n\n*   **Projective Functors**: In the category of functors $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, the basic projective objects are the **representable functors**, denoted $K[-, j]$ for each $j \\in J$. The functor $K[-,j]$ maps an element $i \\in J$ to a vector space with a basis indexed by the morphisms from $i$ to $j$. Since there's at most one such morphism, $K[-,j](i)$ is the field $K$ if $i \\le j$ and the zero vector space $\\{0\\}$ otherwise. Any projective functor is a direct summand of a direct sum of these representable functors.\n\n*   **Tame Functor**: The term \"tame\" can have several meanings.\n    1.  It could refer to the **representation type** of the poset $J$. A poset can be of finite, tame, or wild representation type. \"Tame\" sits between the simple (finite) case and the impossibly complex (wild) case. In this context, \"tame\" is a property of the category $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ as a whole, not of a single functor $f$.\n    2.  In fields like Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a functor (or persistence module) is called \"tame\" if it satisfies certain finiteness conditions, for example, if all the vector spaces $f(j)$ are finite-dimensional.\n\n    We will analyze the implications of the structural property of $J$ first, which will reveal the role of the term \"tame\".\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Core Homological Question\n\nThe question \"for what $n$ is $f$ $n$-resolvable?\" is asking for an upper bound on the projective dimension of the functor $f$. The problem is to find the smallest integer $n$ such that *any* \"tame\" functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ has a projective dimension of at most $n$. This is closely related to the **global dimension** of the functor category $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, which is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all functors in the category.\n\n### Step 3: Leveraging the Upper Semilattice Structure\n\nThe fact that $J$ is an upper semilattice is the most critical piece of information. This structural property has a very strong consequence for the homological algebra of the functor category $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in the representation theory of partially ordered sets that directly addresses this situation.\n\n**Theorem**: Let $P$ be a poset and let $\\text{Func}(P, \\text{Vect}_K)$ be the category of functors from $P$ to $K$-vector spaces. The following are equivalent:\n1.  The poset $P$ is an upper semilattice (also called a join-semilattice).\n2.  The category $\\text{Func}(P, \\text{Vect}_K)$ has a global dimension of at most 1.\n\nThe global dimension being at most 1 means that for *any* functor $F: P \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, its projective dimension is at most 1.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Theorem to Find `n`\n\n1.  We are given that $J$ is an upper semilattice.\n2.  According to the theorem, this implies that the global dimension of the functor category $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 1.\n3.  By the definition of global dimension, this means that every functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n4.  A functor having a projective dimension of at most 1 means that it has a projective resolution of length at most 1. That is, there exists an exact sequence $0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$, where $P_0$ and $P_1$ are projective functors.\n5.  This is precisely the definition of being **1-resolvable**.\n\nTherefore, any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n### Step 5: Listing Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **The irrelevance of \"tame\"**: The theorem holds for *any* functor on an upper semilattice, regardless of whether it is \"tame\" or not. The structural property of $J$ is so powerful that it restricts the homological complexity of all its representations. Thus, the adjective \"tame\" is redundant information. It does not alter the conclusion. Whether it refers to the representation type of $J$ or a finiteness property of $f$, the result that every functor is 1-resolvable remains true.\n*   **Case of global dimension 0**: A category has global dimension 0 if and only if every object is projective. For $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, this happens if and only if $J$ is an antichain (no two distinct elements are comparable). An antichain is an upper semilattice if and only if it contains just one element. In this trivial case, any functor is indeed projective, making it 0-resolvable. Since $0 \\le 1$, the general conclusion of $n=1$ as an upper bound still holds.\n*   **Generality**: This result is independent of the field $K$. It also holds if $\\text{Vect}_K$ is replaced by the category of modules over any ring $R$.\n\n**Conclusion of the analysis**: The property of $J$ being an upper semilattice forces the global dimension of the corresponding functor category to be at most 1. This means every functor defined on $J$ has a projective dimension of at most 1, and is therefore 1-resolvable. The value of $n$ is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
