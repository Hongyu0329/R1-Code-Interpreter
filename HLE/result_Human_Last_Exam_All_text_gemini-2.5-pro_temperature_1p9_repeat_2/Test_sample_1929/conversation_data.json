    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene to determine the product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is `CH2=CH-CH=CH2`. It is a conjugated diene, a molecule with two double bonds separated by a single bond.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is `CCl2=CF2`. It is a substituted alkene.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and an alkene (or alkyne) is a classic example of a **[4+2] cycloaddition**, more commonly known as the **Diels-Alder reaction**. In this reaction, the diene provides a system of 4 pi-electrons and the alkene, called the dienophile, provides a system of 2 pi-electrons. They react in a concerted fashion to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Connectivity of the Product**\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction forms a cyclohexene ring. The mechanism involves the formation of two new single bonds and the relocation of one pi bond.\n*   The four carbons of butadiene (let's number them C1 to C4) and the two carbons of the dienophile (let's call them Cα and Cβ) form the six-membered ring.\n*   New single bonds form between C1 of the diene and one carbon of the dienophile (e.g., Cα), and between C4 of the diene and the other carbon of the dienophile (Cβ).\n*   The pi bond between C2 and C3 of the diene moves to become the new double bond in the cyclohexene product.\n*   The pi bond of the dienophile (Cα=Cβ) becomes a single bond (Cα-Cβ) in the product.\n\nThe resulting ring skeleton will be `C1-C2=C3-C4-Cβ-Cα-`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Regiochemistry**\n\nRegiochemistry refers to which of the possible constitutional isomers is formed when both reactants are unsymmetrical.\n*   **Butadiene (Diene):** The butadiene molecule is symmetrical. It has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C2-C3 single bond, which makes C1 and C4 chemically equivalent.\n*   **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (Dienophile):** This molecule is unsymmetrical. One carbon is bonded to two chlorine atoms (a CCl2 group), and the other is bonded to two fluorine atoms (a CF2 group).\n\nBecause one of the reactants (the diene) is symmetrical, there is no possibility of forming different constitutional isomers (regioisomers). The orientation of the unsymmetrical dienophile relative to the symmetrical diene does not change the final connectivity of the atoms. Only one product structure is possible.\n\n**Step 4: Construct and Name the Product**\n\n1.  **Construct the structure:**\n    The product is a cyclohexene ring where the `C=C` double bond comes from C2 and C3 of butadiene. The carbons adjacent to the double bond in the new ring are the former C1 and C4 of butadiene, which are both `-CH2-` groups. These two `-CH2-` groups are bonded to the carbons from the dienophile, `CCl2` and `CF2`, which are in turn bonded to each other. The resulting structure is:\n\n    ```\n           CH=CH\n          /     \\\n       H2C       CH2\n        |         |\n       C(Cl)2 -- C(F)2\n    ```\n\n2.  **Name the structure using IUPAC rules:**\n    *   **Parent Chain:** The six-membered ring with one double bond is a **cyclohexene**.\n    *   **Numbering:** The carbons of the double bond are assigned positions 1 and 2. The rest of the ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Numbering clockwise from the top-right carbon of the double bond gives substituents at positions 4 and 5. Numbering counter-clockwise from the top-left carbon also gives substituents at positions 4 and 5.\n    *   **Applying Alphabetical Order:** When numbering leads to the same locant set ({4,4,5,5} in this case), the substituent that comes first alphabetically gets the lower number. The substituents are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". Alphabetically, \"dichloro\" comes before \"difluoro\".\n    *   Therefore, the ring must be numbered so that the `CCl2` group is on carbon 4 and the `CF2` group is on carbon 5.\n    *   The complete IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**. The \"-1-\" indicates the position of the double bond, which is often omitted if there is no ambiguity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between symmetrical butadiene and unsymmetrical 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, which yields a single product. The product is a cyclohexene derivative named according to IUPAC rules.\n\nFinal product: **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
