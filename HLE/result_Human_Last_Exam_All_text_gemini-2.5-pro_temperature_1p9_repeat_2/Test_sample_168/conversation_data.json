    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sound produced by a human muscle twitch.**\nFirst, we need to understand the acoustic properties of a muscle twitch. The sound generated by contracting muscles is known as a phonomyogram (PMG) or mechanomyogram (MMG). This sound is characterized by:\n*   **Low Frequency:** The vibrations produced are primarily in the very low-frequency range, typically between 5 Hz and 25 Hz. This range is mostly below the normal lower limit of human hearing, classifying it as infrasound.\n*   **Low Amplitude:** The sound is extremely faint and quiet.\n\nSo, the question is asking which animal has hearing sensitive enough to detect very faint sounds in the 5-25 Hz frequency range.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the hearing capabilities of each animal in the answer choices.**\n\n*   **A. Dog:** The typical hearing range for a dog is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. Their lower limit of 67 Hz is well above the 5-25 Hz range of a muscle twitch. Therefore, a dog would not be able to hear it.\n\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are famous for using echolocation. They produce and hear very high-frequency sounds (ultrasound), typically ranging from 20,000 Hz to 200,000 Hz. This is the opposite end of the sound spectrum from the low-frequency muscle twitch. Therefore, a bat would not be able to hear it.\n\n*   **C. Herring:** Herrings and related fish (clupeids) have a highly specialized and sensitive hearing system. They possess a direct connection between their gas-filled swim bladder and their inner ear. The swim bladder acts like a diaphragm, vibrating in response to sound waves and transmitting these vibrations efficiently to the ear. This adaptation gives them exceptionally sensitive hearing across a broad range, including very low frequencies (below 20 Hz). Scientific studies on predator-prey interactions suggest that this incredible sensitivity might allow herring to detect the faint, low-frequency sounds of a predator's muscles tensing just before an attack, providing a crucial warning to escape. This makes the herring a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **D. Whale:** Large baleen whales, like blue whales and fin whales, are well-known for using and hearing low-frequency infrasound (down to about 10-15 Hz) to communicate over hundreds of miles in the ocean. Their hearing range does overlap with the frequency of muscle twitches. While they can perceive these frequencies, their hearing is adapted for detecting powerful, long-distance calls, not necessarily the extremely faint sound from a small source like a single muscle twitch.\n\n*   **E. Human:** The standard range of human hearing is from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Since most of the sound energy from a muscle twitch is below 20 Hz, humans cannot typically hear them under normal conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the candidates and conclude.**\n\nBoth whales and herring can hear in the necessary low-frequency range. However, the herring's hearing is specifically studied in the context of detecting minute sounds from nearby sources (like predators), which is analogous to hearing a muscle twitch. The herring's auditory system is considered one of the most sensitive among fish, making it the most plausible animal on this list to be able to perform such a feat. While a whale has the correct frequency range, the ecological context and documented specific abilities make the herring the better answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
