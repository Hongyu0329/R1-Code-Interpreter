    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in adult *C. elegans*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Neuron of Interest (Presynaptic):** ASJ. It's important to note that ASJ is a bilateral pair of neurons, ASJL and ASJR.\n    *   **Organism and Life Stage:** *Caenorhabditis elegans* (C. elegans), specifically in the adult stage. The neural wiring can change between larval stages and adulthood.\n    *   **Criteria for \"Main Target\":** The postsynaptic cell that receives the highest number of synapses from ASJ axons. This implies we need to look at quantitative connectome data for chemical synapses.\n    *   **Projection:** The question specifies \"axons,\" which are the primary sites of presynaptic terminals where neurotransmitters are released.\n\n2.  **Identify the Data Source:**\n    *   To answer a quantitative question about synaptic connectivity in *C. elegans*, we must refer to the connectome, which is a comprehensive map of all neural connections.\n    *   The most complete and modern dataset for the adult hermaphrodite is from the work of Cook et al. (2019) and Witvliet et al. (2021). This data was generated using serial section electron microscopy.\n    *   Online resources like WormAtlas, WormWiring.org, and cengen.org provide user-friendly interfaces to explore this data.\n\n3.  **Analyze ASJ Synaptic Outputs:**\n    *   The ASJ neurons are sensory neurons with their cell bodies in the lateral ganglia. Their axons project into the central processing hub of the worm's nervous system, the nerve ring.\n    *   Within the nerve ring, ASJ axons form chemical synapses with a variety of other neurons, primarily interneurons.\n    *   We need to query the connectome data for all postsynaptic partners of ASJL and ASJR and sum the number of synapses for each target neuron type.\n\n4.  **Compare Synapse Counts for Postsynaptic Partners:**\n    *   By querying the adult hermaphrodite connectome data (Cook et al., 2019), we can list the major postsynaptic partners of ASJ and their corresponding synapse counts. The connectivity is largely symmetrical for the left and right sides.\n    *   Let's examine the connections for one side, for example, from ASJR to its partners:\n        *   **AIY (specifically AIYR):** Receives the highest number of synapses, typically around 10 chemical synapses.\n        *   **RIF (specifically RIFR):** Receives a moderate number of synapses, typically around 6.\n        *   **AIA (specifically AIAR):** Receives a moderate number of synapses, typically around 5.\n        *   **RIM (specifically RIMR):** Receives a moderate number of synapses, typically around 5.\n        *   **AIB (specifically AIBR):** Receives a smaller number of synapses, typically around 3.\n    *   Other neurons like AVG, RIA, and RIG also receive synapses, but generally fewer than the top targets listed above.\n\n5.  **Identify the Main Target:**\n    *   Comparing these numbers clearly shows that the **AIY** interneuron receives the largest number of synapses from the ASJ neuron. The connection from ASJL to AIYL shows a similar high count.\n    *   Therefore, across the entire nervous system, the AIY neuron class is the primary synaptic recipient of signals from the ASJ neuron class.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Adult vs. Larva:** The connectome is not static. It is crucial to use data from the adult stage as specified, as synapse numbers and even partners can change during development.\n*   **Chemical Synapses vs. Gap Junctions:** The term \"synapse\" most commonly refers to a chemical synapse. ASJ also forms electrical synapses (gap junctions) with other neurons, but the question implicitly refers to the directed, weighted connections characteristic of chemical synapses. The connectivity pattern is different for gap junctions.\n*   **Data Set Version:** While the original White et al. (1986) connectome was foundational, it was partial. The newer, complete adult connectome from Cook et al. (2019) provides the most accurate and current numbers.\n*   **Cell \"Class\" vs. Individual Cell:** The question asks \"what cell\". AIY is a class of two neurons, AIYL and AIYR. The main target of ASJL is AIYL, and the main target of ASJR is AIYR. It is standard and correct to refer to the target by its class name, \"AIY\".\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is determined.\n\n<<<AIY>>>"
