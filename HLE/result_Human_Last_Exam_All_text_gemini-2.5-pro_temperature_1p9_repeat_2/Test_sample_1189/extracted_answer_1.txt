Let \(f_m\) be the number of sets \(T\) for a given \(m\).
The base cases are \(f_0 = 1\) and \(f_1 = 0\).
For \(m \geq 2\), the value of \(f_m\) can be computed with the following recurrence relation:
\( f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1) f_{m-2} \right) \)
Using the given hint notation \(a = \binom{2^n-1}{m-1}\), this can be written as:
\( f_m = \frac{1}{m} (a - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1) f_{m-2}) \)
