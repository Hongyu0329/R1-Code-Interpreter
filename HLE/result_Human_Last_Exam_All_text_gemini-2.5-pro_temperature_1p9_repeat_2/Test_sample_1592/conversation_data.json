    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish\n*   Waskaganish is a Cree community in Quebec, Canada.\n*   It is located on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n*   Its geographical position is in the northwestern part of the province of Quebec.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories\n*   We must identify the provinces and territories that border Quebec to determine which are potential candidates.\n*   **Ontario:** Borders Quebec to the west and southwest. The border extends north to the coast of James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** Shares a maritime border with Quebec. The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Borders Quebec to the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** Borders Quebec to the southeast.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Candidate\n*   **Waskaganish's location is key:** Being on the shore of James Bay in the northwest of the province immediately suggests that Ontario and Nunavut are the most likely candidates.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador & New Brunswick:** These provinces are located on the far eastern and southeastern borders of Quebec, respectively. They are hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometers away from Waskaganish and can be safely eliminated.\n*   **Comparing Ontario and Nunavut:**\n    *   **Ontario:** The border between Quebec and Ontario meets James Bay just west of Waskaganish. Waskaganish is on the eastern shore of Rupert Bay (an inlet of James Bay), while the Ontario border defines the western shore of this area. The closest point in Ontario is the land directly across the southern tip of James Bay, a relatively short distance over water.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The closest part of the territory of Nunavut to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island, the largest island in James Bay. This island lies to the northwest of Waskaganish, in the middle of the bay.\n\n### Step 4: Estimate and Compare the Distances\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** The straight-line distance from Waskaganish across the water to the nearest point on the Ontario coastline is approximately 50-60 kilometers.\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the southern tip of Akimiski Island (the nearest point in Nunavut) is approximately 200 kilometers.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Analysis\n*   By comparing the distances, the Ontario border is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the nearest landmass belonging to Nunavut.\n*   Therefore, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
