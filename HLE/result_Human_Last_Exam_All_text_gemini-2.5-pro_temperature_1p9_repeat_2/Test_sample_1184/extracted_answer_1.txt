**1. Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 subunit:**
The primary interaction site is the Beta Interaction Domain (BID). The most critical hotspot residues on the human beta-1 subunit (UniProt P15438) for binding are:
*   **Tryptophan 431 (W431):** The most crucial hydrophobic contact. Mutation nearly abolishes binding.
*   **Aspartate 441 (D441):** Forms a critical salt bridge.
*   **Tyrosine 412 (Y412):** Forms a key hydrogen bond.
Other important contributing residues lining the binding groove include I415, L434, I480, and L484.

**2. Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties of alpha-1 subunit:**
These hotspots are regions that allosterically modulate channel behavior after binding.
*   **For Inactivation Gating:** The **N-terminal domain** is the primary hotspot. Specifically, the sequence within this domain at **positions 21-30 (sequence: PSAPSLHSVG)** has been identified as a critical determinant of the slow inactivation kinetics characteristic of the beta-1 subunit.
*   **For Activation Gating:** The **HOOK region** (the flexible linker connecting the SH3 and GK domains, approximately **residues 337-365**) is a known hotspot that influences the voltage-dependence of channel activation.
