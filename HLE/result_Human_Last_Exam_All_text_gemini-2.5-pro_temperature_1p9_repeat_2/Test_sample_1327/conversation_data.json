    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the next number in the given sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the differences between consecutive terms.**\n    *   Let the sequence be denoted by `a_n`.\n    *   `a_2 - a_1` = 11 - 2 = 9\n    *   `a_3 - a_2` = 23 - 11 = 12\n    *   `a_4 - a_3` = 51 - 23 = 28\n    *   `a_5 - a_4` = 119 - 51 = 68\n    *   The sequence of differences is {9, 12, 28, 68}. There is no simple arithmetic or geometric pattern in these differences.\n\n*   **Step 2: Look for a relationship involving multiplication and addition/subtraction.**\n    *   Let's test a recursive relationship of the form `a_(n+1) = 2 * a_n + c`, where `c` might be a constant or a changing value.\n    *   From `a_2` to `a_3`: `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`.\n    *   From `a_3` to `a_4`: `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`.\n    *   From `a_4` to `a_5`: `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the pattern in the added numbers.**\n    *   A clear pattern emerges from the second term onward: `a_(n+1) = 2 * a_n + c_n` for n â‰¥ 2.\n    *   The sequence of added numbers (`c_n`) is {1, 5, 17, ...}.\n    *   Now, we need to find the next number in this new sequence {1, 5, 17, ...}.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the sequence of added numbers {1, 5, 17, ...}.**\n    *   Let's find the differences between the terms in this new sequence.\n    *   Difference 1: `5 - 1 = 4`.\n    *   Difference 2: `17 - 5 = 12`.\n    *   The sequence of these differences is {4, 12, ...}.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the pattern in the new sequence of differences.**\n    *   The sequence {4, 12, ...} is a simple geometric progression. Each term is 3 times the previous term (common ratio `r=3`).\n    *   `4 * 3 = 12`.\n    *   The next difference in this sequence should be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the next added number.**\n    *   To find the next term in the sequence {1, 5, 17, ...}, we add the next difference (36) to the last term (17).\n    *   Next added number = `17 + 36 = 53`.\n\n*   **Step 7: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence.**\n    *   Now we can find the term that comes after 119. The rule is to multiply by 2 and add the next number from our secondary sequence, which is 53.\n    *   Missing term = `(2 * 119) + 53`\n    *   Missing term = `238 + 53`\n    *   Missing term = `291`.\n\n**3. List of Careful Points**\n*   **Irregular First Term:** The established pattern `a_(n+1) = 2 * a_n + c_n` does not apply to the first two terms (2 and 11). This is a common feature in sequence puzzles where the pattern starts after the first term.\n*   **Hierarchical Pattern:** The solution relies on finding a pattern within a pattern. The main sequence's rule depends on a secondary sequence {1, 5, 17, ...}, which in turn has a pattern in its differences {4, 12, ...}.\n*   **Verify Calculations:** Ensure each step of the calculation is correct, from the initial differences to the final sum.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis consistently points to 291 as the next number in the sequence. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
