    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and the Wavefunction**\n\n*   The system is a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, commonly known as a particle in a box. The box has a length `a` and extends from `x=0` to `x=a`.\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in the n-th energy state is given by:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   In this problem, the particle is in the `n = 2` state. So, the specific wavefunction is:\n    $ψ_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n**2. Formulate the Probability Calculation**\n\n*   The probability of finding the particle in a specific region is found by integrating the probability density, `$|ψ(x)|^2$`, over that region.\n*   The probability density for the `n = 2` state is:\n    $P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   We need to find the probability of the particle being in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`. The probability, which we'll call `P_interval`, is given by the integral:\n    $P_{interval} = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n**3. Analyze the Interval and Choose an Approximation Method**\n\n*   The interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is very narrow, with a width of `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`.\n*   The interval is centered at `x = 0.5a`.\n*   For the `n=2` state, the wavefunction `ψ₂(x)` has a node (a point where the function is zero) at `x = a/2 = 0.5a`. Consequently, the probability density `$P(0.5a) = 0$`.\n*   Because the probability density is zero at the center of the integration interval, the simple approximation `$P_{interval} \\approx P(0.5a) \\times \\Delta x$` is not suitable, as it would yield an incorrect result of 0.\n*   We must use a more accurate method. Since the interval is small, we can use a Taylor series approximation for the `sin` function around the node at `x=a/2`.\n\n**4. Perform the Integration using an Approximation**\n\n*   To simplify the integration, let's shift the coordinate system so that the center of the interval is at the origin. Let `u = x - 0.5a`. Then `x = u + 0.5a`, and `dx = du`.\n*   The new integration limits are:\n    *   When `x = 0.495a`, `u = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a`.\n    *   When `x = 0.505a`, `u = 0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a`.\n*   The argument of the sine function becomes:\n    $\\frac{2\\pi x}{a} = \\frac{2\\pi (u + 0.5a)}{a} = \\frac{2\\pi u}{a} + \\pi$\n*   Using the identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, the integral becomes:\n    $P_{interval} = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a} + \\pi\\right) du = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(-\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 du = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right) du$\n*   Within this small interval, the argument of the sine function, `v = 2πu/a`, is very small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(v) ≈ v`.\n    $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right) \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 u^2}{a^2}$\n*   Substituting this approximation into the integral:\n    $P_{interval} \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 u^2}{a^2}\\right) du = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} u^2 du$\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\n*   Now, we evaluate the simple integral of `u²`:\n    $\\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} u^2 du = \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} = \\frac{(0.005a)^3}{3} - \\frac{(-0.005a)^3}{3} = \\frac{2 \\times (0.005a)^3}{3}$\n*   Substitute this back into the expression for the probability:\n    $P_{interval} \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\times \\frac{2 \\times (0.005a)^3}{3} = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} (0.005^3 a^3)$\n*   The `$a^3$` terms cancel out:\n    $P_{interval} \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3 = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n*   Now, calculate the numerical value (using `π² ≈ 9.8696`):\n    $P_{interval} \\approx \\frac{16 \\times 9.8696}{3} \\times 1.25 \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 52.638 \\times 1.25 \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 65.797 \\times 10^{-7}$\n*   Rewriting in standard scientific notation:\n    $P_{interval} \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Quantum State:** Ensure you are using `n=2` for the wavefunction. The location of nodes and antinodes depends critically on `n`. For `n=2`, the center of the box (`x=a/2`) is a node.\n2.  **Probability vs. Wavefunction:** The probability is determined by the square of the wavefunction, `$|ψ(x)|^2$`, not the wavefunction itself.\n3.  **Nature of the Interval:** The problem involves a small interval centered at a node. This is a special case. A simple point-approximation (`Prob ≈ P(center)Δx`) will fail and give a zero probability, which is incorrect.\n4.  **Approximation Method:** Since the interval is small, Taylor series expansion is the appropriate tool. The small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ` for small `θ`) is the first term of the Taylor series and is sufficiently accurate here.\n5.  **Use of Radians:** All arguments for trigonometric functions in physics formulas are in radians.\n6.  **Careful Arithmetic:** The calculation involves small numbers and exponents (`(0.005)³`), so care must be taken to avoid errors. `(0.005)³ = (5×10⁻³)³ = 125×10⁻⁹ = 1.25×10⁻⁷`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
