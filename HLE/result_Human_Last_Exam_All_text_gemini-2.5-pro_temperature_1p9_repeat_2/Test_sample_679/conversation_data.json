    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nFor a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with 7 carbons, the formula would be $C_nH_{2n+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\nDoU = (Number of H in saturated alkane - Number of H in molecule) / 2\nDoU = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This indicates that two carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal. The hint also supports this.\n*   **Chemical Shifts ($\\delta$):**\n    *   The signals at $\\delta = 145$ and $\\delta = 112$ are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which accounts for the DoU of 1.\n*   **Multiplicities (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):** The letters s, t, d, q indicate the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n    *   **s (singlet):** A carbon with no attached hydrogens (quaternary, C).\n    *   **t (triplet):** A carbon with two attached hydrogens (methylene, CH₂).\n    *   **d (doublet):** A carbon with one attached hydrogen (methine, CH).\n    *   **q (quartet):** A carbon with three attached hydrogens (methyl, CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Carbon Skeleton Fragments**\n\n1.  **Alkene Structure:**\n    *   The signal at **145(s)** is a quaternary ($>C<$) $sp^2$ carbon.\n    *   The signal at **112(t)** is a methylene ($-CH_2-$) $sp^2$ carbon.\n    *   Together, these form a disubstituted terminal alkene group: $>C=CH_2$.\n\n2.  **Number of Carbons and Hydrogens from Signals:**\n    Let's count the atoms assuming no signal overlap initially:\n    *   1 C (from s)\n    *   2 CH₂ (from two t signals)\n    *   1 CH (from d)\n    *   2 CH₃ (from two q signals)\n    *   Total: 6 Carbons and (0 + 2*2 + 1 + 2*3) = 11 Hydrogens.\n    The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens. This means that the overlapping signal must be from an additional CH₃ group. Therefore, one of the quartet signals (at 22 or 21 ppm) represents two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n\n3.  **Complete list of Carbon Fragments:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule is composed of the following fragments:\n    *   One quaternary C (from 145s, part of C=C)\n    *   One $sp^2$ CH₂ (from 112t, part of C=C)\n    *   One $sp^3$ CH₂ (from 48t)\n    *   One $sp^3$ CH (from 27d)\n    *   Three $sp^3$ CH₃ (from 22q and 21q, where one signal is for two equivalent carbons)\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments into a Structure**\n\n1.  The core of the molecule is the $>C=CH_2$ unit. The remaining 5 carbon atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms are attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond as two separate alkyl groups (R and R').\n2.  The `sp³` fragments to be assembled are: one CH₂, one CH, and three CH₃ groups (two of which are equivalent).\n3.  The two equivalent methyl groups must be attached to the same carbon to be equivalent. The only fragment that can accommodate this is the CH group. This forms an **isopropyl group**, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This assembly uses the `CH` fragment and the two equivalent `CH₃` fragments.\n4.  The remaining fragments are one CH₂ group and one CH₃ group. Connecting these gives an **ethyl group**, `-CH₂CH₃`.\n5.  Therefore, the two alkyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond are an ethyl group and an isopropyl group.\n\n    The resulting structure is:\n          (CH₃)₂CH — C — CH₂CH₃\n                       ||\n                       CH₂\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nTo name this alkene, we must find the longest continuous carbon chain that *contains* the double bond.\n\n*   Let's number the chain starting from the terminal =CH₂ carbon as C1. The quaternary carbon is C2.\n        (CH₃)₂CH(3') — C(2) — CH₂(3) — CH₃(4)\n                           ||\n                           CH₂(1)\n*   There are two possible parent chains of equal length (4 carbons):\n    1.  **Chain A:** Following the ethyl group: H₂C(1)=C(2)-CH₂(3)-CH₃(4). This gives a **but-1-ene** backbone with an isopropyl group as a substituent at position 2. The name would be 2-isopropylbut-1-ene. This gives **one substituent**.\n    2.  **Chain B:** Following the isopropyl group: H₂C(1)=C(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₃(4). This also gives a **but-1-ene** backbone. The substituents are an ethyl group at position 2 and a methyl group at position 3. The name would be 2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene. This gives **two substituents**.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, when two or more chains have the same maximum length, the one with the greater number of substituents is chosen as the parent chain.\n*   Therefore, Chain B is the correct choice for the parent chain.\n\nThe final IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**.\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   **Structure:** 2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Symmetry:** Contains two equivalent methyl groups in the `3-methyl` part (which is `(CH₃)₂CH-` group attached to C2). This leads to 6 signals, which matches the data.\n*   **Multiplicities:**\n    *   `=CH₂` -> t (112 ppm)\n    *   `=C(Et)(...)` -> s (145 ppm)\n    *   `-CH₂-` of ethyl group (allylic) -> t (48 ppm)\n    *   `-CH(CH₃)₂` group (allylic) -> d (27 ppm)\n    *   `-CH₃` of ethyl group -> q (e.g., 22 ppm)\n    *   Two equivalent `-CH₃` of the isopropyl unit -> q (e.g., 21 ppm, double intensity)\n    All assignments are consistent with the provided data.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
