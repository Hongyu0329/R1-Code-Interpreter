    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European verb *seh₂gieti.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **Form:** *seh₂gieti\n*   **Analysis:** This is a 3rd person singular present indicative verb.\n    *   **Root:** *seh₂g- ('to track, seek out'). The *h₂ is a laryngeal consonant.\n    *   **Suffix:** *-ie/o-*, a common suffix used to form present tense stems (in this case, for a causative or stative verb).\n    *   **Ending:** *-ti*, the 3rd person singular primary active ending.\n*   **Cognates:** The given examples, Latin *sāgīre* ('to perceive keenly, be keen-nosed') and Hittite *sākizzi* ('gives a sign'), confirm the root.\n\n**2. Derivation into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nWe must apply the characteristic sound laws that mark the transition from PIE to Proto-Germanic.\n\n*   **Laryngeals and Vowels:**\n    1.  The laryngeal *h₂ \"colors\" an adjacent *e to *a. So, *seh₂g- becomes *sah₂g-.\n    2.  The laryngeal is then lost. When lost between a vowel and a consonant (*VHC*), it lengthens the preceding vowel. So *sah₂g-* becomes *sāg-.\n    3.  The PIE long vowel *ā becomes *ō in Proto-Germanic. Therefore, the PIE root *sāg-* becomes the PGmc root **\\*sōk-**.\n\n*   **Consonants (Grimm's Law):**\n    1.  PIE voiced stops become voiceless stops in PGmc. Therefore, PIE *g becomes PGmc **\\*k**.\n    2.  The initial PIE *s remains *s in PGmc.\n    3.  Combining these, the PIE root *seh₂g-* yields the PGmc root **\\*sōk-**.\n    4.  *(Careful Point):* Verner's Law, which voices fricatives when the PIE accent does not precede them, does not apply here because the consonant in question (*k*) originates from a PIE voiced stop (*g*), not a PIE voiceless stop that became a fricative.\n\n*   **Verb Morphology:**\n    1.  The PIE suffix *-ie/o-* forms a Class 1 weak verb in Germanic, with an infinitive in **\\*-ijanan** and a stem in **\\*-ija-**.\n    2.  The PIE ending *-ti* becomes **\\*-þi** and then **\\*-þ** in PGmc for the 3rd person singular present.\n    3.  For Class 1 weak verbs with a long/heavy root syllable like *sōk-, the stem for the 3rd person singular is *\\*sōkī-*. The full form is thus *\\*sōkīþ*. The resulting verb is *\\*sōkijaną*, meaning 'to seek'.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **\\*sōkiþ** '(s)he seeks'.\n\n**3. Derivation into Daughter Languages**\n\n**A. Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Vowel Change:** PGmc *ō regularly diphthongizes to **uo** in OHG (e.g., PGmc *brōþēr* > OHG *bruoder*).\n*   **Consonant Change (High German Consonant Shift):** PGmc *k shifts to the voiceless fricative **hh** when it occurs between vowels (e.g., in the infinitive *\\*suohhen* < *sōkijaną*) or **h** after the root vowel in the 3sg.\n*   **Morphology:** The PGmc 3sg ending *-iþ* becomes **-it** in OHG.\n*   **(Careful Point):** In Old High German, i-umlaut (the fronting of a back vowel caused by a following *i* or *j*) did not consistently apply to *uo* in this verb class in the early period. Thus, the root remains *suohh-*.\n*   **Old High German Result:** **suohhit** '(s)he seeks'. The infinitive is *suohhen*.\n\n**B. Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Vowel Change (i-umlaut):** The *i/j* in the PGmc suffix (*-ija-*, *-ī-*) causes i-umlaut on the root vowel. PGmc *ō* is fronted to **ē** (often written with an accent, *é*).\n*   **Consonant Change (Palatalization):** The PGmc consonant *k*, when followed by a new front vowel like *ē*, is palatalized (softened) in Old English to **ċ**, pronounced /tʃ/ (the \"ch\" sound in \"church\").\n*   **Morphology:** The PGmc ending *-iþ* becomes **-eþ** or contracts to **-þ**.\n*   **Old English Result:** **sēċeþ** (or the contracted form *sēċþ*) '(s)he seeks'. The infinitive is *sēcan*.\n\n**C. Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Vowel Change (i-umlaut):** Like in Old English, the *i/j* from the suffix causes i-umlaut. PGmc *ō* is fronted and rounded to **œ̄** (written as **œ**).\n*   **Consonants:** PGmc *k* remains *k* in Old Norse in this position.\n*   **Morphology:** The 3rd person singular present indicative ending in Old Norse for weak verbs is typically **-r**.\n*   **Old Norse Result:** **sœkir** '(s)he seeks'. The infinitive is *sœkja*.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step phonological and morphological analysis, the PIE verb *seh₂gieti develops as follows:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkiþ\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkir\n*   **Old English:** sēċeþ (or sēċþ)\n*   **Old High German:** suohhit\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ; Old Norse: sœkir; Old English: sēċeþ; Old High German: suohhit>>>"
