    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the physicist in question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks to identify a specific physicist based on a set of clues. The core components of the question are:\n1.  **Profession:** The individual is a physicist.\n2.  **Primary Field:** They are \"better known\" for their work in microscopy.\n3.  **Discovery:** They discovered an optical effect.\n4.  **Discovery Context:** The effect pertains to \"real imagery\".\n5.  **Origin Story:** The discovery was prompted by an accidental observation made by a custodial worker.\n6.  **Equipment Involved:** The worker was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n### Step 2: List All the Careful Points\n*   The phrase \"better known for\" is subjective but important. The physicist may be famous for other work too, but microscopy must be a significant part of their legacy.\n*   The anecdote about the custodial worker is a very specific and unusual detail. This is likely the most crucial clue for identifying the correct person and event.\n*   The technical details \"optical effect,\" \"real imagery,\" and \"concave mirrors\" place the discovery squarely within the field of classical optics. A real image is one that can be projected onto a surface, which is something concave mirrors are capable of producing.\n*   We need to identify not just the physicist but also the specific optical effect and ensure all parts of the story align.\n\n### Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n1.  **Start with the most unique clue:** The story about the custodial worker observing an effect while cleaning concave mirrors. A search for this anecdote in the history of physics points to the story of the **Schlieren effect**.\n2.  **Identify the Schlieren effect:** This is an optical method used to visualize transparent phenomena, such as variations in air temperature or pressure (like heat rising from a hand or shockwaves from a jet). These phenomena are normally invisible because they don't block light, but they do bend it slightly.\n3.  **Connect the effect to the equipment:** Schlieren photography setups (Schlierenscopes) often use large, precisely ground concave mirrors to collimate light and then refocus it. An image is formed at the focal point. This fits the \"concave mirrors\" and \"real imagery\" clues.\n4.  **Connect the effect to the story:** The famous story involves the American physicist **Robert W. Wood** while he was at Johns Hopkins University. He had a large concave telescope mirror in his lab. A janitor/custodial worker was polishing the mirror, and Wood noticed that the heat rising from the worker's head was visible as streaks against the mirror's surface. This was a demonstration of the Schlieren effect. While the effect had been described earlier by others (like August Toepler, who named it), Wood's use of it and this particular story are well-known.\n5.  **Verify the final clue:** Was Robert W. Wood \"better known for work in the microscopy field\"? Wood was an extremely versatile experimental physicist, famous for pioneering work in infrared and ultraviolet photography, developing diffraction gratings, and studying fluorescence. He also made significant, though less famous, contributions to microscopy. He invented a \"phase-contrast\" method before Frits Zernike (who later won a Nobel Prize for it) and did important work in ultraviolet microscopy. Given his wide range of accomplishments, it is plausible to say his microscopy work is a major part of his legacy, even if he's also known for other areas of optics. The combination of all the other clues points unequivocally to him.\n\nTherefore, the physicist who fits all the criteria is Robert W. Wood.\n\n<<<Robert W. Wood>>>"
