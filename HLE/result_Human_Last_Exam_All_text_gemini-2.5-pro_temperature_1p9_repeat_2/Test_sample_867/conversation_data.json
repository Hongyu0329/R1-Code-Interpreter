    "To determine the number of *sissone fermes* Svetlana Zakharova performed in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, a step-by-step analysis of the specific choreography is required.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Performance and Choreography**\nThe question specifies the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, with Svetlana Zakharova as Odette. This specific performance is well-documented, most notably in the \"Live from the Bolshoi\" cinema broadcast recorded on January 25, 2015, which is the widely available version representing this period. The choreography by Grigorovich is distinct and has set sequences.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Act II Odette Variation**\nIn Act II (the \"White Act\"), after the *grand pas de deux adagio*, Odette performs a solo variation. This variation showcases her sorrow, grace, and bird-like quality through a series of demanding steps.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Ballet Step: Sissone Ferme**\nA *sissone* is a jump that takes off from two feet. A *sissone ferme* (closed sissone) specifically refers to a sissone where the dancer lands on one foot, and the other foot quickly closes to it, typically into the 5th position. In this variation, Odette performs them moving forward (*en avant*).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation Step-by-Step**\nObserving Zakharova's performance of this variation reveals the following structure:\n1.  The variation begins with a sequence of turns and slow *développés*.\n2.  This is followed by a diagonal sequence of traveling steps, which are *piqué* turns and *fouetté sautés*, not *sissone fermes*.\n3.  The central part of the variation, where the specific step in question appears, involves a sequence moving directly downstage (towards the audience).\n4.  Starting from upstage center, Zakharova performs a set of three *sissone fermes en avant* on one side. Each one is a clear jump from two feet, opening into the air, and closing crisply upon landing.\n5.  After these three steps, she performs a small connecting jump sequence (*entrechat quatre* followed by a *changement*), which serves to switch the working leg.\n6.  She then immediately repeats the sequence of three *sissone fermes en avant* on the other side.\n7.  The rest of the variation consists of other steps, including *ronds de jambe en l'air sautés*, a famous sequence of *petits battements*, and turns, with no further *sissone fermes*.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number**\nBy counting the steps in the key sequences identified in Step 4:\n*   First sequence moving downstage: **3** *sissone fermes*.\n*   Second sequence moving downstage (after changing feet): **3** *sissone fermes*.\n*   Total count = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nTherefore, Svetlana Zakharova performed a total of 6 *sissone fermes* in this variation.\n\n<<<6>>>"
