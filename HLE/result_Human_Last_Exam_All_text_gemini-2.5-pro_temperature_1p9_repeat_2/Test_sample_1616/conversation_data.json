    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define Trisyllabic Laxing:** Trisyllabic laxing (or shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel or diphthong becomes a short (lax) vowel if it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word. For this rule to apply, a word must be at least three syllables long.\n\n2.  **Analyze each word against the definition:**\n\n    *   **derivative:**\n        *   Syllables: de-riv-a-tive (4 syllables).\n        *   Related word: `derive` /dɪˈraɪv/, with a long diphthong sound /aɪ/.\n        *   In `derivative` /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/, the vowel is in the antepenultimate (third-to-last) syllable, `-riv-`.\n        *   The sound has changed from /aɪ/ to a short /ɪ/.\n        *   Conclusion: `derivative` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n    *   **serenity:**\n        *   Syllables: se-ren-i-ty (4 syllables).\n        *   Related word: `serene` /səˈriːn/, with a long vowel /iː/.\n        *   In `serenity` /səˈrɛnəti/, the vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable, `-ren-`.\n        *   The sound has changed from /iː/ to a short /ɛ/.\n        *   Conclusion: `serenity` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n    *   **gratitude:**\n        *   Syllables: grat-i-tude (3 syllables).\n        *   Related word: `grateful` /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/, with a long diphthong sound /eɪ/. (The root is Latin `grātus` with a long `ā`).\n        *   In `gratitude` /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/, the vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable, `grat-`.\n        *   The sound has changed from /eɪ/ to a short /æ/.\n        *   Conclusion: `gratitude` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n    *   **southern:**\n        *   Syllables: south-ern (2 syllables).\n        *   This word is only two syllables long. By definition, it cannot undergo **trisyllabic** laxing, which requires a third-from-last syllable. While there is vowel shortening from `south` (/aʊ/) to `southern` (/ʌ/), the mechanism is not trisyllabic laxing.\n\n    *   **pleasant:**\n        *   Syllables: pleas-ant (2 syllables).\n        *   This word is also only two syllables long and cannot undergo **trisyllabic** laxing. The shortening from `please` (/iː/) to `pleasant` (/ɛ/) is a different phonological process, often called pre-cluster shortening.\n\n    *   **shadow:**\n        *   Syllables: shad-ow (2 syllables).\n        *   This word is only two syllables long, so it cannot have undergone **trisyllabic** laxing.\n        *   More fundamentally, let's look at its etymology. `Shadow` comes from Old English `sceadu`, where the first vowel (`æ`) was already short. It has remained a short /æ/ throughout its history. The related word `shade` (/ʃeɪd/), which has a long vowel, is a later development (a back-formation). Therefore, the word `shadow` never had a long vowel in the first place that could be shortened.\n\n**Careful Points & Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   Three words (`derivative`, `serenity`, `gratitude`) are at least three syllables long and clearly demonstrate trisyllabic laxing. They are incorrect answers.\n*   The other three words (`southern`, `pleasant`, `shadow`) are all only two syllables long, so by definition, none of them could have undergone **trisyllabic** laxing.\n*   However, the question asks for the single best answer. We must distinguish between the remaining three. Both `southern` and `pleasant` *did* undergo a form of vowel shortening when compared to their roots (`south`, `please`).\n*   `Shadow` is unique because its root form in Old English already had a short vowel. It never possessed a long vowel that needed shortening. Thus, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing, nor has it undergone any other historical vowel shortening process. This makes it the strongest and most definitive answer.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
