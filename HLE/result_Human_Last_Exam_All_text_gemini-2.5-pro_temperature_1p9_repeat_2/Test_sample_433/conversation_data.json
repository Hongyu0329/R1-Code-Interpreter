    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Key Terms**\n\n*   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** As defined by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), this is a container intended for a single use, for a single patient. It lacks an antimicrobial preservative. An ampule is a type of SDC.\n*   **Ampule:** A hermetically sealed glass container that holds a sterile liquid. It is opened by breaking the neck. Crucially, once opened, an ampule **cannot be resealed**.\n*   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to an ISO Class 5 environment, such as a Laminar Airflow Workbench (LAFW) or a Compounding Aseptic Isolator (CAI), as required by USP General Chapter <797> for sterile compounding.\n*   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** The date and time after which a preparation shall not be used. For an opened SDC, this refers to how long it can be used after it has been opened or punctured.\n*   **Puncture:** While the term \"puncture\" is typically used for vials with rubber stoppers, for an ampule, the equivalent action is breaking it open.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Critical Factor**\n\nThe most critical factor in determining the BUD for an opened ampule is its physical design. Unlike a vial, which has a rubber stopper that reseals after a needle is withdrawn, an ampule is an open container once broken. It is fully exposed to the surrounding environment.\n\n**Step 3: Consulting the Governing Standard (USP <797>)**\n\nUSP Chapter <797> provides the standards for sterile compounding and the handling of sterile containers. The guidelines are very specific regarding ampules:\n\n*   Because ampules cannot be resealed after opening, the contents are directly exposed to the environment.\n*   This exposure creates a significant risk of microbial contamination.\n*   There is also a risk of introducing glass particulates into the solution when the ampule is broken.\n*   For these reasons, the standards mandate that the contents of an opened ampule must be used immediately.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguishing Ampules from Vials**\n\nIt is important not to confuse the rule for ampules with the rule for single-dose *vials*.\n\n*   **Single-Dose Vial:** According to the 2023 USP <797> standards, a single-dose vial that is punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment may be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture. This is because the vial's rubber stopper provides a protective barrier.\n*   **Single-Dose Ampule:** This 12-hour rule **does not apply** to ampules. Their open nature after breaking presents an unacceptable risk for storage.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **No Storage Permitted:** The central principle is that an opened ampule cannot be stored for any period. The term BUD in this context does not imply a storage time.\n2.  **Immediate Use:** \"Immediate use\" means that the withdrawal of the drug from the ampule and its subsequent use or preparation should be a continuous process without delay.\n3.  **Discard Remainder:** Any medication left in the ampule after the dose has been withdrawn must be discarded immediately. It cannot be saved for a later dose.\n4.  **Risk of Contamination:** The primary reason for this strict rule is the high risk of contamination from airborne microbes and glass particles from the breaking process. A filter needle is typically required to withdraw medication from an ampule to remove glass particulates.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of pharmaceutical standards and the physical properties of the container, an opened single-dose ampule has no storage time. The contents must be used immediately.\n\n***\nThe contents must be used **immediately**, and any unused portion must be discarded. The opened ampule cannot be stored for any period."
