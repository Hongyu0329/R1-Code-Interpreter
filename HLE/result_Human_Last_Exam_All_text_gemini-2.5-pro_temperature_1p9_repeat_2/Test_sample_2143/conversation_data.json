    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Clues:** The question provides several key pieces of information:\n    *   **Source of Interpretation:** The analysis is attributed to \"Veronika Campan\". She is a French psychoanalyst whose work often intersects with theology and scripture.\n    *   **The Subject:** The subject is a male figure, referred to as \"HE\".\n    *   **The Work:** The subject is credited with a significant \"work\", likely a foundational text or code of laws.\n    *   **Location within the Work:** The specific passage in question is \"at the end of HIS work\".\n    *   **Content of the Passage:** The passage addresses \"another's material possessions\".\n    *   **Methodology:** The subject (\"HE\") accomplishes this by \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\".\n\n2.  **Identify the \"Prohibition Against Representation\":** This is a very specific and famous religious injunction. It is most widely known as the Second Commandment in the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) found in the Bible (Exodus 20:4): \"You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath...\" This commandment forbids the creation of idols or visual representations, especially of God.\n\n3.  **Identify the Work and the Passage on Material Possessions:** The most famous code of laws that includes the prohibition against representation and ends with a rule about material possessions is the Ten Commandments.\n    *   The \"work\" is the Decalogue (The Ten Commandments).\n    *   The end of this work contains the Tenth Commandment (Exodus 20:17): \"You shall not covet your neighbor’s house... you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This directly addresses \"another's material possessions\".\n\n4.  **Synthesize with Veronika Campan's Interpretation:** Now, we connect the clues to the psychoanalytic interpretation mentioned.\n    *   The Second Commandment establishes a rule against *making* images.\n    *   The Tenth Commandment, by explicitly *listing* the desirable objects one should not covet (\"house\", \"wife\", \"ox\", \"donkey\"), forces the listener or reader to *imagine* them. This creates a mental *representation* of those very things.\n    *   According to this interpretation, the final commandment, in order to function, must evoke mental imagery, thereby \"naturally ignoring\" the spirit of the absolute prohibition on representation stated earlier in the text.\n\n5.  **Identify \"HE\":** The figure who, according to biblical tradition, delivered this \"work\" (the Ten Commandments) to his people after receiving it from God on Mount Sinai is the prophet and lawgiver **Moses**. He is the \"HE\" referred to in the question.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** All clues point to Moses. His work is the Law containing the Ten Commandments. At the end of the Commandments, he addresses coveting another's possessions. The method described matches a known psychoanalytic reading of how the Tenth Commandment's text functions in relation to the Second Commandment. The question asks for his full name, which in this context is simply his well-known single name.\n\n***\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The key is linking \"prohibition against representation\" with the Second Commandment and \"another's material possessions\" with the Tenth Commandment.\n*   Recognizing that \"Veronika Campan\" points toward a psychoanalytic interpretation of a religious text is crucial.\n*   The phrase \"naturally ignoring\" is the core of the interpretation: the text's own structure and language create an effect that seems to bypass an earlier rule.\n*   The \"end of HIS work\" is a direct reference to the placement of the Tenth Commandment as the last of the ten.\n*   The question asks for the full name. For historical/biblical figures like this, their given name is considered their full name.\n***\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
