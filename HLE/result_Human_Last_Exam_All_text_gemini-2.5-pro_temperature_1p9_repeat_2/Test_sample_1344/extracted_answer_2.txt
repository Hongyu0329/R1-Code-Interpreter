The optimal combination is a **single-site zirconium hydride catalyst supported on dehydroxylated silica (Zr-H / SiO₂) a**.

*   **Metal:** **Zirconium (Zr)** is the ideal Group IV metal, balancing high activity for polymerization with the required reactivity for C-C bond cleavage.
*   **Ligand & Support:** A **high-surface-area silica (SiO₂) support** serves a dual role. It is not merely a support but also functions as a robust, thermally stable macro-ligand. The zirconium atom is chemically grafted to the surface via covalent siloxy (≡SiO) bonds, creating a site-isolated, single-site catalyst with exceptional thermal stability that is not achievable with traditional molecular organic ligands.
*   **Active Species:** The active site is a **zirconium hydride (Zr-H)**, formed by activating a grafted zirconium precursor with H₂. This Zr-H species is capable of initiating olefin polymerization at lower temperatures and catalyzing the hydrogenolysis (degradation) of polyolefins into short alkanes at higher temperatures and H₂ pressures.
