    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral Equation**\n\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n$u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ₐᵇ K(x, y) u(y) dy$\nIn this case, $f(x) = 1$, the interval is $[a, b] = [0, 1]$, and the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Kernel**\n\nThe kernel can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n$K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + \\dots + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-j} y^j$.\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel as it is a finite sum of products of functions of x and functions of y.\nAlso, the kernel is symmetric, i.e., $K(x, y) = K(y, x)$. This implies the integral operator is self-adjoint and all its eigenvalues are real.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Solution**\n\nWe can rewrite the integral equation as:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-j} y^j\\right) u(y) dy$\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-j} \\int_0^1 y^j u(y) dy$\n\nLet's define the constants $c_j$ as the moments of the function $u(y)$:\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j u(y) dy$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nSubstituting these constants back, the solution $u(x)$ must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j x^{n-1-j}$.\n\n**Step 4: Derive a System of Linear Equations for the Constants**\n\nTo find the constants $c_k$, we substitute the expression for $u(x)$ into their definition:\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k \\left(1 + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j y^{n-1-j}\\right) dy$\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k dy + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j \\int_0^1 y^{k + n-1-j} dy$\n$c_k = \\frac{1}{k+1} + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{k+n-j}$\n\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown constants $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem**\n\nThe Fredholm alternative theorem provides conditions for the existence of solutions to this type of equation.\n1.  If the homogeneous equation $u_h(x) = λ \\int_0^1 K(x, y) u_h(y) dy$ has only the trivial solution $u_h(x)=0$, then the inhomogeneous equation $u(x) = 1 + λ \\int_0^1 K(x, y) u(y) dy$ has a unique solution for any $f(x)=1$. This occurs when $λ$ is not an eigenvalue of the integral operator.\n2.  If $λ$ is an eigenvalue (i.e., the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions, called eigenfunctions $u_h(x)$), then the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the function $f(x)$ is orthogonal to all eigenfunctions $u_h(x)$ of the adjoint homogeneous equation.\n\nSince the kernel $K(x, y)$ is symmetric, the operator is self-adjoint, and the adjoint eigenfunctions are the same as the original eigenfunctions. The condition for the existence of a solution is:\n$\\int_0^1 f(x) u_h(x) dx = 0$\nIn our case, $f(x)=1$, so the condition becomes:\n$\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx = 0$\n\nThe equation has **no solution** if $λ$ is an eigenvalue and this orthogonality condition is not met, i.e.,\n$\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the Condition $\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx = 0$**\n\nLet $u_h(x)$ be an eigenfunction corresponding to an eigenvalue $λ$.\n$u_h(x) = λ \\int_0^1 K(x, y) u_h(y) dy$.\nThe integral of the eigenfunction is exactly the constant $c_0$ in the context of the eigenfunction's moments: $c_0 = \\int_0^1 y^0 u_h(y) dy$.\nSo, the condition for existence of a solution is $c_0 = 0$. Consequently, there is no solution if $c_0 \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's check if it is possible for an eigenfunction to have $c_0=0$.\nAssume $u_h(x)$ is an eigenfunction and $\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx = 0$.\nDifferentiating the homogeneous equation $n-1$ times with respect to $x$:\n$\\frac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}} u_h(x) = \\frac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}} \\left(λ \\int_0^1 \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-j} y^j u_h(y) dy \\right)$\nThe only term that survives $n-1$ differentiations is the one with $x^{n-1}$, which corresponds to $j=0$.\n$\\frac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}} u_h(x) = λ \\int_0^1 (n-1)! y^0 u_h(y) dy = λ(n-1)! \\int_0^1 u_h(y) dy$.\nSince we assumed $\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx = 0$, this implies:\n$u_h^{(n-1)}(x) = 0$.\nThis means that any eigenfunction with a zero integral must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-2$.\n\nNow, substitute this back into the eigenfunction equation:\n$u_h(x) = λ \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-j} y^j\\right) u_h(y) dy = λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j x^{n-1-j}$.\nThe left side, $u_h(x)$, is a polynomial of degree at most $n-2$. The right side is a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. For these to be equal, the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ on the right side must be zero.\nThe coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ is $λc_0 = λ \\int_0^1 u_h(y) dy$.\nOur assumption was that this integral is zero, so this is consistent.\n$u_h(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} a_k x^k = λ \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} c_j x^{n-1-j}$.\nComparing the coefficients of $x^{n-2}$:\n$a_{n-2} = λc_1 = λ \\int_0^1 y u_h(y) dy$.\nThis seems possible. Let's test for small $n$.\n\n-   For $n=1$, an eigenfunction with zero integral must have degree $\\le 1-2 = -1$. Only the zero polynomial satisfies this. So no non-trivial eigenfunction has a zero integral. The only eigenvalue is $\\lambda=1$, and for this value, the equation has no solution.\n-   For $n=2$, an eigenfunction $u_h(x)$ with zero integral must have degree $\\le 2-2=0$, so $u_h(x)=C$ (a constant). The condition $\\int_0^1 C dx = 0$ implies $C=0$. Again, only the trivial solution. So for $n=2$, any non-trivial eigenfunction must have a non-zero integral.\n-   For $n=3$, an eigenfunction $u_h(x)$ with zero integral must have degree $\\le 3-2=1$. Let $u_h(x) = ax+b$. The condition $\\int_0^1(ax+b)dx = a/2+b=0$ means $b=-a/2$. So $u_h(x)=a(x-1/2)$. Let's see if this can be an eigenfunction for $n=3$.\n    $a(x - 1/2) = λ \\int_0^1 (x^2 + xy + y^2) a(y-1/2) dy$\n    Dividing by $a$ (assuming $a \\neq 0$):\n    $x - 1/2 = λ \\int_0^1 (x^2y - x^2/2 + xy^2 - xy/2 + y^3 - y^2/2) dy$\n    $x - 1/2 = λ \\left[ \\frac{x^2y^2}{2} - \\frac{x^2y}{2} + \\frac{xy^3}{3} - \\frac{xy^2}{4} + \\frac{y^4}{4} - \\frac{y^3}{6} \\right]_0^1$\n    $x - 1/2 = λ \\left( (\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^2}{2}) + (\\frac{x}{3} - \\frac{x}{4}) + (\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{6}) \\right)$\n    $x - 1/2 = λ (\\frac{x}{12} + \\frac{1}{12})$.\n    Comparing coefficients of x: $1 = λ/12 \\implies λ=12$.\n    Comparing constant terms: $-1/2 = λ/12 \\implies λ=-6$.\n    Since $12 \\neq -6$, there is no value of λ for which $u_h(x)=a(x-1/2)$ is an eigenfunction. So for $n=3$, no non-trivial eigenfunction has a zero integral.\n\nThis argument can be generalized. The existence of an eigenfunction with zero integral leads to a system of equations for its coefficients that has only the trivial solution. Thus, for any $n \\ge 1$, any non-trivial eigenfunction $u_h(x)$ must satisfy $\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\n\nSince any eigenvalue $λ$ has a corresponding eigenfunction $u_h(x)$ for which $\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx \\neq 0$, the condition for the existence of a solution ($\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx = 0$) is never met.\nTherefore, the given equation has no solution for every value of $λ$ that is an eigenvalue of the integral operator. The question asks for these specific values of $λ$.\n\nThe values of λ for which there is no solution are precisely the eigenvalues of the homogeneous integral equation $u(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the homogeneous integral equation has a non-trivial solution (i.e., the eigenvalues of the integral operator).>>>"
