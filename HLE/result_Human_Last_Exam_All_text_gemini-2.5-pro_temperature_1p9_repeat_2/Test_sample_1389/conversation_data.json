    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine confers complete immunity to a certain fraction of the vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection at all to the remaining fraction. Let's denote the fraction of vaccinated people who become fully immune as `p`. The remaining fraction, `1-p`, receives no benefit and remains fully susceptible, just like unvaccinated individuals.\n    *   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_p):** This measures the reduction in the risk of infection from a *single* exposure to the pathogen for a vaccinated individual compared to an unvaccinated one.\n    *   **Incidence Rate (I):** This is the rate at which new cases occur in a population over time (e.g., cases per 100 person-years).\n    *   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (I_v) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (I_u). IRR = I_v / I_u.\n    *   **The Estimator in Question:** The question asks about the quantity `1 - IRR`, which is the standard formula for overall vaccine efficacy (VE).\n\n2.  **Analyze Per-Exposure Efficacy (VE_p) for an All-or-Nothing Vaccine:**\n    *   For the fraction `p` of vaccinated individuals who are fully immune, their probability of infection per exposure is 0. Their per-exposure efficacy is 100% (or 1).\n    *   For the fraction `1-p` of vaccinated individuals who are not protected, their probability of infection per exposure is identical to that of an unvaccinated person. Their per-exposure efficacy is 0%.\n    *   In the context of an all-or-nothing vaccine model, the \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" is conceptually equivalent to the proportion of the vaccinated population that is rendered fully immune. Therefore, for this model, **VE_p = p**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Incidence Rates for Each Group:**\n    *   Let's denote the force of infection (the rate at which susceptible individuals are exposed and infected) as `λ`. We assume `λ` is the same for both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, meaning they have similar exposure patterns.\n    *   **Unvaccinated Group (Incidence Rate I_u):** All individuals in this group are susceptible. The rate at which new infections occur is directly proportional to the force of infection. Thus, **I_u = λ**.\n    *   **Vaccinated Group (Incidence Rate I_v):** In this group, only the fraction `1-p` is susceptible to infection. The fraction `p` is immune and contributes zero new cases. Therefore, new infections only occur within the susceptible subgroup. The overall incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group is the force of infection (`λ`) acting on the proportion that is susceptible (`1-p`). Thus, **I_v = λ * (1 - p)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Estimator `1 - IRR`:**\n    *   First, calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):\n        IRR = I_v / I_u = [λ * (1 - p)] / [λ]\n    *   The force of infection, `λ`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n        IRR = 1 - p\n    *   Now, calculate the final estimator `1 - IRR`:\n        1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - p) = 1 - 1 + p = **p**\n\n5.  **Compare the Estimator to the True Value:**\n    *   From Step 4, we found that the estimator `1 - IRR` is equal to `p`.\n    *   From Step 2, we established that the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p) for an all-or-nothing vaccine is also equal to `p`.\n    *   Since the value calculated from the incidence rates (`p`) is identical to the parameter we want to estimate (`p`), the `1 - IRR` formula **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Model Dependency:** This conclusion holds true specifically for the \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine model (and also, as it happens, for the \"leaky\" vaccine model). The relationship between different VE measures can change with more complex models (e.g., vaccines that reduce severity but not infection).\n*   **Key Assumption:** The analysis relies on the crucial assumption that the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups have the same risk of exposure (i.e., the same force of infection `λ`). If, for example, vaccinated individuals change their behavior to be riskier, this would violate the assumption and bias the result.\n*   **No Waning Immunity:** We assume that the immunity status (fully protected or fully susceptible) does not change over the observation period.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe estimator `1 - IRR` yields the value `p`, and the true parameter `VE_p` is also `p`. Therefore, the estimator is unbiased and correctly estimates the parameter in question.\n\n<<<C>>>"
