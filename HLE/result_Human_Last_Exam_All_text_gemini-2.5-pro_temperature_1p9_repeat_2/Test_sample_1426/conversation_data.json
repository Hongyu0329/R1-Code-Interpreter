    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Piece and Section:** The question specifies the composer (Antonín Dvořák), the work (Symphony No. 2, Op. 4), the instrument (first violin), and the specific location (the end of the symphony).\n\n2.  **Consult the Score:** To find the precise notes, we must refer to the full musical score of Dvořák's Symphony No. 2. We need to look at the last page of the final movement (IV. Allegro con fuoco) and locate the staff for the \"Violino I\" (First Violin).\n\n3.  **Interpret the Phrase \"ends on three notes\":** The very final event for the first violins is a single, long-held note. This means the \"three notes\" likely refer to the final melodic phrase or motif leading into this ultimate conclusion. This is a common way of referring to the end of a musical passage.\n\n4.  **Examine the Final Measures for the First Violin:**\n    *   The final measure of the symphony has the first violins playing a single whole note.\n    *   Looking at the measures immediately before the final bars, we can identify the concluding melodic statement. In measures 504 and 505 (the 4th- and 3rd-to-last measures of the violin part), there is a clear melodic phrase that resolves.\n    *   **Note 1:** In measure 504, the first note of this final phrase is **F**. (Specifically, F5, the F on the top line of the treble clef).\n    *   **Note 2:** Later in measure 504, the second note is **D**. (Specifically, D5, the D on the fourth line of the treble clef).\n    *   **Note 3:** In measure 505, this phrase resolves to the third note, a long-held **B-flat**. (Specifically, B♭4, the B-flat on the middle line of the treble clef).\n\n5.  **Identify the Lowest Note:** The three notes that form this concluding melodic figure are **F, D, and B-flat**. To find the lowest one, we compare their pitches:\n    *   F is the highest.\n    *   D is lower than F.\n    *   B-flat is lower than D.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Symphony:** It is important to analyze Symphony No. 2, Op. 4, and not confuse it with later symphonies that might be more famous.\n*   **Musical Phrasing:** The key is understanding that \"ends on\" often refers to a concluding musical idea or phrase, not just the single last note played.\n*   **Pitch vs. Note Name:** The question asks for the note, and by comparing the pitches of F5, D5, and B♭4, we can definitively say which is the lowest. B♭4 is the lowest pitch in this specific group.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe three notes making up the final melodic statement for the first violin are F, D, and B-flat. By comparing their positions on the musical staff and their respective frequencies, the lowest of these three is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
