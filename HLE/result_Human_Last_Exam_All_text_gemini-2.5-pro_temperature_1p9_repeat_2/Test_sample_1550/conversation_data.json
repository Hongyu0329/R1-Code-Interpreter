    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of real intersection points of the two plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $f_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $f_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Determine the type of the conics**\n\nA conic section given by $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is classified by its discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor equation (1):\n$A_1 = 164$, $B_1 = -216$, $C_1 = 72$\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$.\nSince $\\Delta_1 < 0$, the first conic is an ellipse. To be sure it is a real ellipse (not empty or a point), we can check if it has real points. For example, finding its center and canonical form shows it's a real ellipse.\n\nFor equation (2):\n$A_2 = 864$, $B_2 = -1056$, $C_2 = 324$\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$.\nSince $\\Delta_2 < 0$, the second conic is also an ellipse. Again, one can verify it is a real ellipse.\n\nThe problem is to find the number of intersection points between two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equations using a change of variables**\n\nThe quadratic part of equation (1) is $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2$. We can simplify this by completing the square.\n$Q_1(x, y) = 72(y^2 - 3xy) + 164x^2 = 72(y - \\frac{3}{2}x)^2 - 72(\\frac{3}{2}x)^2 + 164x^2$\n$= 72(y - \\frac{3}{2}x)^2 - 72(\\frac{9}{4}x^2) + 164x^2 = 72(y - \\frac{3}{2}x)^2 - 162x^2 + 164x^2 = 2x^2 + 72(y - \\frac{3}{2}x)^2$.\nThis suggests a change of variables to align the first ellipse with the coordinate axes.\nLet $u = x$ and $v = y - \\frac{3}{2}x$, which is equivalent to $v = \\frac{2y - 3x}{2}$. Let's use $v' = 2y-3x$ for simplicity. So, $x=u$ and $y = \\frac{v'+3u}{2}$.\nSubstitute this into equation (1):\nThe quadratic part becomes $2u^2 + 18(v')^2$.\nThe linear and constant parts become $-16u + 31$.\nSo equation (1) in $(u, v')$ coordinates is:\n$2u^2 + 18(v')^2 - 16u + 31 = 0$.\nCompleting the square for $u$:\n$2(u^2 - 8u) + 18(v')^2 + 31 = 0$\n$2(u - 4)^2 - 32 + 18(v')^2 + 31 = 0$\n(A) $2(u - 4)^2 + 18(v')^2 = 1$.\nThis is the equation of an ellipse in the $(u,v')$-plane, centered at $(4, 0)$.\n\nNow, transform equation (2) with the same change of variables $x=u, y = \\frac{v'+3u}{2}$:\n$864u^2 - 1056u(\\frac{v'+3u}{2}) + 324(\\frac{v'+3u}{2})^2 - 560u + 324(\\frac{v'+3u}{2}) + 149 = 0$.\nExpanding and grouping terms:\n$u^2(864 - 1056 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} + 324 \\cdot \\frac{9}{4}) + u v'(-1056 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 324 \\cdot \\frac{6}{4}) + (v')^2(324 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}) + u(-560 + 324 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}) + v'(324 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) + 149 = 0$\n$u^2(864 - 1584 + 729) + u v'(-528 + 486) + (v')^2(81) + u(-560 + 486) + v'(162) + 149 = 0$\n(B) $9u^2 - 42uv' + 81(v')^2 - 74u + 162v' + 149 = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the system of simplified equations**\n\nWe need to solve the system formed by (A) and (B).\nFrom (A), we can express $18(v')^2$ in terms of $u$: $18(v')^2 = 1 - 2(u-4)^2$.\nFor real solutions to exist, we must have $1 - 2(u-4)^2 \\ge 0$, which means $(u-4)^2 \\le 1/2$. This gives the range for $u$: $4 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\le u \\le 4 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nLet's try to find a simpler equation by taking a linear combination of the original equations.\nConsider $2f_2 - 9f_1=0$. In $(u,v')$ coordinates, this is $2(B) - 9(A')$ where $A'$ is the expanded form of (A).\n$A': 2u^2 + 18(v')^2 - 16u + 31 = 0$\n$2(B) - 9(A') = [18u^2 - 84uv' + 162(v')^2 - 148u + 324v' + 298] - [18u^2 + 162(v')^2 - 144u + 279] = 0$.\nThis simplifies to:\n$-84uv' - 4u + 324v' + 19 = 0$.\nThis is a hyperbolic relation between $u$ and $v'$ for any intersection points. We can express $v'$ in terms of $u$:\n$v'(324 - 84u) = 4u - 19$\n$v' = \\frac{4u - 19}{324 - 84u}$.\n\nSubstitute this into the relation from equation (A): $(v')^2 = \\frac{1 - 2(u-4)^2}{18}$.\n$(\\frac{4u - 19}{324 - 84u})^2 = \\frac{1 - 2(u^2-8u+16)}{18} = \\frac{1-2u^2+16u-32}{18} = \\frac{-2u^2+16u-31}{18}$.\nLet $P(u) = 2u^2-16u+31$. The equation becomes:\n$(\\frac{4u - 19}{12(27-7u)})^2 = \\frac{-P(u)}{18}$\n$\\frac{(4u-19)^2}{144(27-7u)^2} = \\frac{-P(u)}{18}$\n$\\frac{(4u-19)^2}{8(27-7u)^2} = -P(u) = 2u^2 - 16u + 31$. My earlier derivation had a sign flip ($L(u)=-P(u)=-(...)$), let's rewrite carefully.\nEquation to solve is $1-2(u-4)^2 = 18v'^2$:\n$1 - 2(u-4)^2 = 18 \\left(\\frac{4u - 19}{324 - 84u}\\right)^2$.\nLet's call the left side $L(u)$ and the right side $R(u)$.\n$L(u) = 1 - 2(u-4)^2$. This is a downward-opening parabola with its maximum at $u=4$, where $L(4)=1$. The roots are at $u=4 \\pm 1/\\sqrt{2}$. We are interested in the interval $I = [4-1/\\sqrt{2}, 4+1/\\sqrt{2}]$, where $L(u) \\ge 0$.\n$R(u) = 18 \\left(\\frac{4u-19}{12(27-7u)}\\right)^2 = \\frac{18}{144} \\frac{(4u-19)^2}{(27-7u)^2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\frac{(4u-19)^2}{(27-7u)^2}$.\nThe term $R(u)$ is always non-negative. A solution exists only if $L(u) = R(u)$.\n\n**Step 4: Graphical Analysis of the solution**\n\nWe need to find the number of intersections of the curves $y=L(u)$ and $y=R(u)$ for $u \\in I \\approx [3.293, 4.707]$.\nThe curve $y=L(u)$ is an arc of a parabola starting at $(4-1/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, reaching a maximum at $(4, 1)$, and ending at $(4+1/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$.\nThe curve $y=R(u)$ has a vertical asymptote at $u=27/7 \\approx 3.857$, which is inside the interval $I$.\nLet's analyze the two sub-intervals of $I$.\n\n1) On $I_1 = [4-1/\\sqrt{2}, 27/7) \\approx [3.293, 3.857)$:\nAt $u=4-1/\\sqrt{2}$, $L(u)=0$ and $R(u)>0$. So $R(u)>L(u)$.\nAs $u \\to 27/7$ from the left, $L(u) = 1 - 2(27/7-4)^2 = 1 - 2(-1/7)^2 = 1-2/49=47/49 \\approx 0.96$.\nAs $u \\to 27/7$ from the left, the denominator of $R(u)$ goes to $0^+$, so $R(u) \\to +\\infty$.\nThe derivatives are $L'(u) = -4(u-4)$ and $R'(u) = \\frac{241(4u+19)}{4(27-7u)^3}$.\nOn $I_1$, $L'(u)$ is positive, and $R'(u)$ is also positive. An analysis of the derivatives shows that $R'(u) > L'(u)$ throughout this interval. This means the gap between $R(u)$ and $L(u)$ is always increasing. Since it starts positive ($R>L$), there can be no intersection in this interval.\n\n2) On $I_2 = (27/7, 4+1/\\sqrt{2}] \\approx (3.857, 4.707]$:\nAs $u \\to 27/7$ from the right, $R(u) \\to +\\infty$ while $L(u)$ is finite ($47/49$). So $R(u)>L(u)$.\nAt $u=4+1/\\sqrt{2}$, $L(u)=0$ while $R(u) > 0$. So $R(u)>L(u)$.\nLet's analyze the derivatives on $I_2$.\n$L'(u)=-4(u-4)$ is positive for $u<4$ and negative for $u>4$.\n$R'(u)=\\frac{241(4u+19)}{4(27-7u)^3}$ is negative on this interval since $27-7u < 0$.\nA detailed analysis shows that the range of values for $L'(u)$ on $I_2$ is $[-2\\sqrt{2}, 4/7) \\approx [-2.828, 0.571)$.\nThe range of values for $R'(u)$ on $I_2$ is $(-\\infty, R'(4+1/\\sqrt{2})] \\approx (-\\infty, -10.8]$.\nSince the ranges do not overlap, and in fact $R'(u) < L'(u)$ for the whole interval $I_2$, the function $h(u) = R(u)-L(u)$ is strictly decreasing on $I_2$.\nSince $h(u)$ starts at $+\\infty$ as $u \\to 27/7^+$ and decreases to a positive value at $u=4+1/\\sqrt{2}$, it never reaches 0. There are no intersections in this interval either.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe algebraic analysis shows there are no real solutions for $u$. Since the change of coordinates from $(x,y)$ to $(u,v')$ is a real-to-real mapping, no real solution in $(u,v')$ implies no real solution in $(x,y)$. Therefore, the two ellipses do not have any real intersection points.\n\nA quick geometric check: The center of the second ellipse, $C_2=(4.5, 41/6)$, lies on the first ellipse curve $f_1(C_2)=0$. The center of the first ellipse, $C_1=(4,6)$, lies inside the second ellipse ($f_2(C_1)=-3<0$). At the point $C_2$ (on $E_1$), the value of the function defining $E_2$ is $f_2(C_2) = -4<0$. This means the point $C_2$ on the first ellipse is located in the interior of the second ellipse. This is a strong indication that the first ellipse may be entirely contained within the second one, which would result in zero intersection points.\n\nThus, both the rigorous algebraic analysis and a more robust geometric consideration point to the same conclusion.\n\nThe number of real intersection points is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
