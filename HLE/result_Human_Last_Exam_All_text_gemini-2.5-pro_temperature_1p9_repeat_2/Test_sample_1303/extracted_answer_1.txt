The ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817 represents the **SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro)**, a critical enzyme for the virus's replication. Small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with it are typically inhibitors that block its function. Key examples include:
1.  **Nirmatrelvir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4649726):** The highly potent active ingredient in the approved COVID-19 drug, Paxlovid. It acts as a covalent inhibitor of Mpro.
2.  **Ensitrelvir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL5076639):** A potent non-covalent Mpro inhibitor used in an oral antiviral drug for COVID-19, approved in Japan.
3.  **GC-376 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL3934484):** A broad-spectrum covalent inhibitor of coronavirus proteases, originally developed for a feline coronavirus, that was an important early research compound for SARS-CoV-2.
4.  **Boceprevir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL1416):** A repurposed drug for Hepatitis C that was found to have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
5.  **Ritonavir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL837):** An HIV protease inhibitor co-administered with Nirmatrelvir. It has very weak interaction with Mpro itself but is essential as a pharmacokinetic booster to increase Nirmatrelvir levels in the body.
