    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Threat:** The question specifies a threat from an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer\". In cryptography, this implies a quantum computer that can successfully run known quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm against cryptographic systems.\n\n2.  **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography:**\n    *   **Asymmetric cryptography** (like RSA or ECC) is based on mathematical problems that are hard for classical computers but easy for quantum computers. Shor's algorithm, for instance, can break RSA and ECC relatively easily. This means current asymmetric encryption is not quantum-resistant.\n    *   **Symmetric cryptography** (like AES) uses the same key for encryption and decryption. The main way to attack a symmetric cipher, if there are no other known vulnerabilities, is a brute-force attack—trying every possible key.\n\n3.  **Classical Brute-Force Attack:**\n    *   For a symmetric key of length *n* bits, there are 2^n possible keys.\n    *   A classical computer would need to perform, on average, 2^(n-1) operations to find the key. The computational complexity is considered to be on the order of O(2^n).\n    *   A 128-bit key (like in AES-128) provides 2^128 possible keys. This level of security is considered completely unbreakable by any existing or foreseeable classical computer.\n\n4.  **Quantum Brute-Force Attack (Grover's Algorithm):**\n    *   The most efficient known quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric ciphers is **Grover's algorithm**.\n    *   Grover's algorithm provides a **quadratic speedup** for searching an unstructured database (like the space of all possible keys).\n    *   Instead of taking O(N) time like a classical search, Grover's algorithm takes approximately O(√N) time.\n    *   For an *n*-bit symmetric key, where the number of keys is N = 2^n, a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm can find the key in approximately √(2^n) = 2^(n/2) operations.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Required Security Level:**\n    *   This means that a quantum computer effectively halves the security strength of a symmetric key, when measured in bits.\n    *   For a 128-bit key, the effective security against a quantum computer is reduced to 2^(128/2) = 2^64. While 2^64 is a very large number, it is considered potentially within reach of a powerful adversary, and therefore not secure enough for long-term protection.\n    *   To maintain a security level that is considered robust for the long term (even against classical attacks), we aim for a minimum security level of 128 bits. This means an attacker would need to perform at least 2^128 operations.\n\n6.  **Finding the Minimum Quantum-Resistant Key Length:**\n    *   We need to find the key length *n* such that the effective quantum security is at least 128 bits.\n    *   The effective quantum security is *n*/2.\n    *   We set up the equation: *n*/2 ≥ 128.\n    *   Solving for *n*: *n* ≥ 256.\n    *   Therefore, to achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least **256 bits** long. A 256-bit key provides an effective quantum security of 2^(256/2) = 2^128.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinguish between symmetric and asymmetric crypto attacks:** Quantum computers are a catastrophic threat to current asymmetric standards (RSA, ECC) but are only a significant, though manageable, threat to symmetric standards (AES).\n*   **Identify the correct quantum algorithm:** The relevant algorithm for breaking symmetric keys is Grover's algorithm, not Shor's algorithm.\n*   **Understand the nature of the speedup:** Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup (√N), not an exponential speedup. This is a crucial difference. It weakens the cipher but does not break it outright in the way Shor's algorithm breaks RSA.\n*   **Establish a baseline for \"secure\":** The generally accepted minimum security level for long-term data protection is 128 bits of effective security. This means an attacker must perform at least 2^128 computational operations.\n*   **Focus on the *minimum* required length:** The question asks for the minimum key length. While a 512-bit key is also secure, 256 bits is the standard minimum recommendation to achieve 128-bit post-quantum security. This is why organizations like NIST recommend transitioning to AES-256 for data requiring long-term confidentiality.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, a 128-bit symmetric key's security is reduced to 64 bits by a quantum computer, which is not considered safe. To achieve the industry-standard minimum of 128 bits of security against a quantum computer, the original key length must be at least 256 bits.\n\n<<<A>>>"
