The proposed filtering strategy involves four main command-line implementable steps. First, generate a reference list of highly-expressed genes from an independent RNA-seq profile of the cancer cell line used in the co-culture; this is the "contaminant signature." Second, perform the differential expression analysis on your experimental data (`CAR-IL15` vs `CAR-only`) and create a list of genes that are significantly upregulated in the `CAR-only` group (e.g., log2FC < -2 and adjusted p-value < 0.05), as these are potential contaminants. Third, find the intersection of these two gene lists to create a high-confidence list of contaminating genes. Fourth, filter your complete differential expression results table by removing all genes present in this final high-confidence contaminant list. This produces a cleaned result set that is free from the primary confounding artifact.
