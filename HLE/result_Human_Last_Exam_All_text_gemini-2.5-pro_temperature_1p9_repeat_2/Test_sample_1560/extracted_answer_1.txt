After the gate Q is applied and a measurement is performed, the system collapses to one of the following basis states with the specified probabilities:
- The final state is $|0\rangle$ with probability $2/11$.
- The final state is $|1\rangle$ with probability $2/11$.
- The final state is $|2\rangle$ with probability $9/22$.
- The final state is $|3\rangle$ with probability $2/11$.
- The final state is $|4\rangle$ with probability $1/22$.
