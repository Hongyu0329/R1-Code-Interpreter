    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the equation and find a better model.**\n\nLet the curve be $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThe coefficients are integers, so this equation defines a model over $\\mathbb{Z}$. We want to study its reduction modulo 2.\nThe equation modulo 2 is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$, or $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This is a non-reduced line, which is not a stable curve. We need to find a better model, typically by a change of variables.\n\nThe branch points of the hyperelliptic map are the roots of $f(x)$ and the point at infinity. Analyzing the 2-adic valuations of these roots is key to understanding the stable reduction.\nThe roots of $f(x)$ have different 2-adic valuations. Some are poles from a 2-adic perspective (they are not in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$). To handle this, we seek a coordinate change on $\\mathbb{P}^1$ that makes all branch points integral.\n\nLet's try the substitution $x=z/2$.\n$y^2 = 8(z/2)^5 + 4(z/2)^4 + 4(z/2)^3 + (z/2)^2 + 8(z/2)$\n$y^2 = 8(z^5/32) + 4(z^4/16) + 4(z^3/8) + z^2/4 + 4z$\n$y^2 = z^5/4 + z^4/4 + z^3/2 + z^2/4 + 4z$\nTo get an integral model, we multiply by 4:\n$4y^2 = z^5 + z^4 + 2z^3 + z^2 + 16z$\nLet $Y = 2y$. The equation becomes:\n$Y^2 = z^5 + z^4 + 2z^3 + z^2 + 16z$\nLet $g(z) = z^5 + z^4 + 2z^3 + z^2 + 16z$. This gives us a new model of the curve, $C': Y^2 = g(z)$, which is birationally equivalent to the original curve. All coefficients of $g(z)$ are in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the roots of the new polynomial $g(z)$.**\n\nThe stable reduction is determined by how the roots of $g(z)$ coalesce under reduction modulo 2. We use the Newton polygon to find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $g(z)$.\nFirst, factor out $z$: $g(z) = z(z^4 + z^3 + 2z^2 + z + 16)$.\nOne root is $r_0 = 0$.\nLet $P(z) = z^4 + z^3 + 2z^2 + z + 16$. We construct the Newton polygon for $P(z)$ at $p=2$. The points are $(i, v_2(a_i))$ where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $z^i$:\n*   $a_0=16 \\implies (0, v_2(16)) = (0,4)$\n*   $a_1=1 \\implies (1, v_2(1)) = (1,0)$\n*   $a_2=2 \\implies (2, v_2(2)) = (2,1)$\n*   $a_3=1 \\implies (3, v_2(1)) = (3,0)$\n*   $a_4=1 \\implies (4, v_2(1)) = (4,0)$\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,4)$ to $(1,0)$. The slope is $(0-4)/(1-0) = -4$. The horizontal length is 1. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $z_1$, with valuation $v_2(z_1) = -(\\text{slope}) = 4$.\n2.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(4,0)$ (passing through $(3,0)$). The slope is $(0-0)/(4-1)=0$. The horizontal length is 3. This corresponds to three roots, let's call them $u_1, u_2, u_3$, each with valuation $v_2(u_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = 0$. A valuation of 0 means these roots are 2-adic units.\n\nSo the five roots of $g(z)$ are $\\{0, z_1, u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ with valuations $v_2(0)=\\infty$, $v_2(z_1)=4$, and $v_2(u_{1,2,3})=0$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate root valuations to the stable reduction.**\n\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by the 2-adic distances, $v_2(r_i-r_j)$, between the roots.\n*   For any two unit roots $u_i, u_j$, their difference $u_i-u_j$ is either a unit or has $v_2(u_i-u_j)>0$. The reduction of $P(z)$ modulo 2 is $z^4+z^3+z = z(z^3+z^2+1)$. The roots are $0$ and the three distinct roots of $z^3+z^2+1$, which is irreducible. Therefore, the reductions of $u_1, u_2, u_3$ are distinct and non-zero. So $v_2(u_i-u_j)=0$.\n*   $v_2(u_i - 0) = v_2(u_i) = 0$.\n*   $v_2(u_i - z_1) = \\min(v_2(u_i), v_2(z_1)) = \\min(0, 4) = 0$.\n*   $v_2(z_1 - 0) = v_2(z_1) = 4$.\n\nAll pairs of roots are \"far apart\" (valuation 0), except for the pair $(0, z_1)$. The bad reduction is entirely caused by these two roots coalescing modulo 2 (since $v_2(z_1-0)=4>0$, they both reduce to 0).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of double points.**\n\nThe number of double points (nodes) formed by a pair of roots $(r_i, r_j)$ that coalesce is determined by their 2-adic distance $n = v_2(r_i-r_j)$. According to the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves (especially the \"cluster graph\" model or specific results on resolving singularities):\nIf the distance $n$ is an even integer, say $n=2m$, the pair of roots contributes $m$ double points to the stable reduction.\nIf the distance $n$ is an odd integer, say $n=2m+1$, it contributes $m$ double points.\n\nIn our case, the only pair contributing to bad reduction is $(0, z_1)$, and their distance is $n=4$. Since $n$ is even, we set $n=2m$, which gives $4=2m$, so $m=2$.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has 2 double points. These nodes arise from the coalescence of the roots 0 and $z_1$. The rest of the curve reduces to a smooth component on which the other branch points lie.\n\nFinal Answer is 2.\n\n>>>2"
