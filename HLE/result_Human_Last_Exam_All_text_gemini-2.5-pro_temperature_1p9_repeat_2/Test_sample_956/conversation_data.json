    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the group G**\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations $a, b, c$ acting on the set $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z\\}$ of size 12.\n\nLet's analyze the generators:\n1.  $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$ is a cycle of length 11. As a permutation, its sign is $(-1)^{11-1} = 1$, so it's an even permutation. The order of $a$ is $|a|=11$.\n2.  $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$ is a product of two disjoint 4-cycles. Its sign is $(-1)^{4-1} \\cdot (-1)^{4-1} = (-1)^3 \\cdot (-1)^3 = (-1)(-1) = 1$, so it's an even permutation. The order of $b$ is $|b| = \\text{lcm}(4, 4) = 4$.\n3.  $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$ is a product of six disjoint transpositions (2-cycles). Its sign is $(-1)^6 = 1$, so it's an even permutation. The order of $c$ is $|c| = 2$.\n\nSince all three generators $a, b, c$ are even permutations, the group $G = \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ they generate is a subgroup of the alternating group on 12 elements, $A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of G**\n\nThe set of generators is characteristic of one of the sporadic simple groups, the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. We can verify this by examining the properties of $G$.\n\n*   **Transitivity:** The generator $a$ is an 11-cycle that connects all elements of $\\Omega$ except for $z$. Specifically, the orbit of 1 under $\\langle a \\rangle$ is $\\{1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x\\}$. The generator $c$ maps an element of this orbit, 3, to $z$ (since $c(3) = z$). Therefore, the orbit of 1 under $G$ includes all 12 elements of $\\Omega$. Thus, $G$ is a transitive group of degree 12.\n\n*   **Point Stabilizer:** Let's consider the stabilizer of the point $z$, denoted $G_z$. The generators $a$ and $b$ both fix $z$ (i.e., $a(z)=z, b(z)=z$). So, the subgroup $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G_z$. $H$ acts on the remaining 11 points $\\Omega' = \\Omega \\setminus \\{z\\}$.\n    *   On $\\Omega'$, $a$ is an 11-cycle, so $H$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_{11}$.\n    *   A transitive subgroup of $S_p$ (for prime $p$) containing a $p$-cycle is either doubly transitive or a subgroup of the affine group $AGL(1,p)$. The group $AGL(1, 11)$ has order $11 \\cdot 10 = 110$, and does not contain elements of order 4 (element orders are divisors of 10, or 11). Since $|b|=4$, $H$ cannot be a subgroup of $AGL(1, 11)$.\n    *   Thus, $H$ is a doubly transitive group of degree 11.\n    *   Furthermore, both $a$ and $b$ are even permutations when acting on $\\Omega'$, so $H \\le A_{11}$.\n    *   A theorem by C. Jordan, refined by others, states that a transitive group of degree 11 containing an element of order 4 must be one of $M_{11}$, $PSL(2, 11)$, $A_{11}$, or $S_{11}$.\n    *   We know $H \\le A_{11}$. $PSL(2, 11)$ does not contain elements of order 4. This leaves $H$ as either $M_{11}$ or $A_{11}$.\n    *   The generators $a$ and $b$ are, up to relabeling, standard generators for the Mathieu group $M_{11}$. The group they generate is not $A_{11}$. Thus, we can identify $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle \\cong M_{11}$.\n\n*   **Identification of G:** We have shown $G$ is a transitive group of degree 12, and the stabilizer of a point, $G_z$, contains a subgroup $H \\cong M_{11}$. The generator $c$ is in $G$ but not in $G_z$ (since $c(z)=3$). The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem states $|G| = |\\text{Orbit}(z)| \\cdot |G_z| = 12 \\cdot |G_z|$. Since $M_{11} \\le G_z$, we have $|G| \\ge 12 \\cdot |M_{11}| = 12 \\cdot 7920 = 95040$.\n    The group $M_{12}$ is defined as a transitive group of degree 12 whose point stabilizer is $M_{11}$. Its order is $|M_{12}| = 95040$. Since $G \\le A_{12}$ has these properties, we can conclude that $G \\cong M_{12}$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Schur Multiplier of G**\n\nThe question defines $A$ as the Schur multiplier of $G$. Since we have identified $G \\cong M_{12}$, we need to find the Schur multiplier of $M_{12}$. The Schur multiplier of a group $K$ is denoted $M(K)$ or $H_2(K, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nFor the Mathieu group $M_{12}$, the Schur multiplier is a well-known result from the theory of finite simple groups.\n$M(M_{12}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\nSo, the abelian group $A$ is isomorphic to $C_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism**\n\nWe have $A \\cong C_2$. We need to find the number of its proper subgroups, up to isomorphism.\n\n*   **Subgroups of A:** As a cyclic group of prime order 2, $C_2$ has only two subgroups by Lagrange's Theorem:\n    1.  The trivial subgroup, $\\{e\\}$, of order 1.\n    2.  The group itself, $C_2$, of order 2.\n\n*   **Proper subgroups of A:** A proper subgroup of a group is any subgroup except the group itself. Therefore, the only proper subgroup of $A \\cong C_2$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\n*   **Number of subgroups up to isomorphism:** We are asked to count the number of isomorphism classes of these proper subgroups.\n    *   The only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n    *   The trivial subgroup is isomorphic to the trivial group, often denoted $C_1$.\n    *   Thus, there is only one isomorphism class for the proper subgroups of $A$.\n\nThe number of proper subgroups of $A$, up to isomorphism, is 1."
