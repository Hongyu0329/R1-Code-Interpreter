    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the terminology and the group structure**\n\n*   **Power Subgroup**: A subgroup H of a group G is called a \"power subgroup\" if it can be generated by a single element of G. This is the definition of a **cyclic subgroup**. So, the question is asking for the number of cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512.\n*   **Semidihedral Group**: The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ (for $n \\ge 4$) is denoted by $SD_{2^n}$. Its presentation is given by:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{-1+2^{n-2}} \\rangle$.\n*   **Our Specific Group**: The size is 512, which is $2^9$. So, we are dealing with $SD_{2^9}$, which means $n=9$.\n    The presentation is:\n    $G = SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{-1+2^{7}} = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    Since $s^2=1$, we have $s=s^{-1}$, so the relation can also be written as $srs = r^{127}$.\n\nThe elements of the group can be partitioned into two sets:\n1.  The elements of the cyclic subgroup $C = \\langle r \\rangle = \\{r^j \\mid 0 \\le j < 256\\}$. This is a normal subgroup of order 256.\n2.  The elements not in $C$, which form the coset $sC = \\{sr^j \\mid 0 \\le j < 256\\}$. There are 256 such elements.\n\nWe will count the cyclic subgroups by categorizing them into two types: those that are contained within $C$ and those that are not.\n\n**Step 2: Count the cyclic subgroups contained in C**\n\nThe subgroup $C = \\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256.\nA fundamental property of cyclic groups is that for any divisor $d$ of the group's order, there exists exactly one subgroup of order $d$.\nTo find the number of subgroups of $C$, we need to find the number of divisors of its order, 256.\nThe order is $256 = 2^8$. The divisors are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$.\nThere are $8+1=9$ divisors.\nTherefore, there are **9** cyclic subgroups contained within $C$. These are the subgroups $\\langle r^{256/d} \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of 256. They have orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.\n\n**Step 3: Count the cyclic subgroups not contained in C**\n\nAny subgroup not contained in $C$ must be generated by an element from the coset $sC$, i.e., an element of the form $g = sr^j$ for some $j \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$. Let's determine the orders of these elements.\n\nWe need to calculate $g^2 = (sr^j)^2$. We use the relation $sr = r^{127}s$.\nA more general and useful relation is $s r^k s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^k$. Since $s=s^{-1}$, we have $sr^k s = (srs)^k = (r^{127})^k = r^{127k}$.\nSo, $sr^j s = r^{127j}$.\nNow, we compute the square of $g$:\n$g^2 = (sr^j)^2 = sr^j s r^j = (sr^j s) r^j = r^{127j} r^j = r^{128j}$.\n\nWe analyze the order of $g$ based on whether $j$ is even or odd:\n*   **Case 1: j is even.**\n    Let $j=2m$, where $m \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 127\\}$.\n    $g^2 = r^{128(2m)} = r^{256m} = (r^{256})^m = 1^m = 1$.\n    So, if $j$ is even, the element $sr^j$ has order 2.\n    There are 128 even numbers for $j$ in the range $\\{0, ..., 255\\}$. Each of these 128 elements of order 2 generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2 (e.g., $\\langle sr^{2a} \\rangle$ and $\\langle sr^{2b} \\rangle$ are different if $a \\neq b$).\n    Thus, there are **128** cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by these elements.\n\n*   **Case 2: j is odd.**\n    Let $j$ be an odd number.\n    $g^2 = r^{128j}$. Since $j$ is odd, $\\gcd(j, 2)=1$. The order of $r^{128j}$ is $o(r) / \\gcd(128j, 256) = 256 / 128 = 2$.\n    So, $g^2 = r^{128j} \\neq 1$, but $(g^2)^2 = (r^{128j})^2 = r^{256j} = 1$.\n    This means $g^4=1$, so the element $sr^j$ has order 4 when $j$ is odd.\n    There are 128 odd numbers for $j$ in the range $\\{0, ..., 255\\}$. So, we have 128 elements of order 4.\n    A cyclic group of order 4 has two generators (the element and its inverse). We need to find how many distinct subgroups these 128 elements generate.\n    Let $H_j = \\langle sr^j \\rangle$. Its other generator is $(sr^j)^3 = (sr^j)^{-1} = r^{-j}s^{-1} = r^{-j}s$.\n    We can write $r^{-j}s$ in the form $sr^k$:\n    $r^{-j}s = s(sr^{-j}s) = s((r^{127})^{-j}) = s r^{-127j}$.\n    So the two generators of $H_j$ are $sr^j$ and $sr^{-127j}$.\n    Two subgroups $H_j$ and $H_k$ are the same if and only if $k$ is in the set $\\{j, -127j\\} \\pmod{256}$.\n    Since $-127 \\equiv 129 \\pmod{256}$, the pair of exponents is $\\{j, 129j\\} \\pmod{256}$.\n    Since $129^2 = (128+1)^2 = 128^2 + 2 \\cdot 128 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{256}$, the mapping $j \\mapsto 129j$ is an involution. It has no fixed points for odd $j$ (as $128j \\equiv 0 \\pmod{256}$ is not possible for odd $j$).\n    This involution pairs up the 128 odd values of $j$. Each pair of exponents corresponds to a single cyclic subgroup.\n    The number of such subgroups is the number of pairs, which is $128 / 2 = 64$.\n    Thus, there are **64** cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by these elements.\n\n**Step 4: Summing up the counts**\n\nThe sets of subgroups we counted are disjoint:\n1.  Subgroups contained in $C$.\n2.  Subgroups of order 2 not in $C$.\n3.  Subgroups of order 4 not in $C$.\n\nThe total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from these three sets.\nTotal Number = (Subgroups in C) + (Subgroups of order 2 not in C) + (Subgroups of order 4 not in C)\nTotal Number = $9 + 128 + 64$\nTotal Number = $201$\n\nTherefore, there are 201 power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the semidihedral group of size 512."
