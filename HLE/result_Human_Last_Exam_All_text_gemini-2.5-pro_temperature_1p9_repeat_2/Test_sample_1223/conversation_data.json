    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the objects in the question\n\n*   **$X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum:**\n    *   A **continuum** is a non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable** means $X$ cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Hereditary indecomposable** means that every subcontinuum of $X$ is also indecomposable. This is a very strong property. A famous example is the **pseudo-arc**.\n    *   **Metric** means the topology is given by a metric, which implies $X$ is second-countable and Hausdorff.\n\n*   **$x \\in X$:** A point in the space $X$.\n\n*   **$Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** The space $X$ with the point $x$ removed. Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space.\n\n*   **The Stone-Cech compactification of $Y$, $\\beta Y = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$:** This is the largest (in a categorical sense) compact Hausdorff space that contains $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n\n*   **The Stone-Cech remainder, $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$:** This is the set of points added to $Y$ to form its Stone-Cech compactification. It is a compact (and thus closed) subset of $\\beta Y$.\n\n*   **Composants of the Stone-Cech remainder:** We need to find the number of composants of the remainder $R$.\n    *   A **composant** of a continuum $K$ is a maximal set $C \\subseteq K$ with the property that for any two points $p, q \\in C$, there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ that contains both $p$ and $q$.\n    *   Equivalently, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $K$ that contain $p$.\n    *   The question asks for the maximum possible number of distinct composants in the continuum $R$.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the basic properties of the remainder $R$\n\nThe space $X$ is a compactification of $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$. By the universal property of the Stone-Cech compactification, there is a unique continuous surjective map $f: \\beta Y \\to X$ which is the identity on $Y$. The remainder $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ is precisely the preimage of the point $x$ under this map, i.e., $R = f^{-1}(x)$.\n\nA crucial theorem in continuum theory states that for a continuum $K$ and a point $p \\in K$, the remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is itself a continuum if and only if $p$ is not a cut point of any subcontinuum of $K$ that contains it.\nIn our case, $X$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum. A property of indecomposable continua is that they have no cut points. Since every subcontinuum of $X$ is indecomposable, no subcontinuum of $X$ has a cut point. Therefore, $x$ is not a cut point of any subcontinuum of $X$ containing it.\nAs a result, the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a continuum.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the possible number of composants\n\nWe are asked for the maximum possible number of composants of the continuum $R$. Let's analyze the number of composants a general non-trivial continuum can have.\nThe number of composants of a continuum can be:\n*   1 (e.g., the Hilbert cube).\n*   2 (e.g., two pseudo-arcs joined by identifying a proper subcontinuum in each).\n*   Countably infinite (this is also possible, though less common in introductory examples).\n*   $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). This occurs for indecomposable continua (like the pseudo-arc) and also for some decomposable ones (like the circle $S^1$).\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum possible* number. The largest possible value is $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. To show that this is the maximum possible number in our specific setting, we must show that it is an *attainable* number. That is, we need to find an example of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ for which its remainder $R$ has $c$ composants.\n\n### Step 4: Finding an example that achieves the maximum\n\nTo show that $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is an attainable number of composants for $R$, a good strategy is to find an example of a hereditarily indecomposable continuum $X$ for which the remainder $R$ is an **indecomposable continuum**. This is because any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has exactly $c$ pairwise disjoint, dense composants.\n\n1.  **Choose a specific hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum for $X$.**\n    The **pseudo-arc** is the prime example of a hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum. A key additional property of the pseudo-arc is that it is **chainable** (or arc-like).\n\n2.  **Use a theorem about remainders of chainable continua.**\n    A fundamental theorem by David P. Bellamy (1987) states: If $K$ is a chainable continuum and $p \\in K$, then the remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n3.  **Apply the theorem to our chosen example.**\n    Let $X$ be the pseudo-arc. Since the pseudo-arc is a chainable continuum, we can apply Bellamy's theorem. For any point $x$ in the pseudo-arc, the corresponding remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n4.  **Count the composants of the resulting remainder.**\n    The remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum. Every non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is known to be the union of $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ pairwise disjoint composants. Therefore, for this choice of $X$, the remainder $R$ has $c$ composants.\n\n### Step 5: Final conclusion\n\nWe have shown that it is possible to choose a hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum $X$ (namely, the pseudo-arc) such that the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is an indecomposable continuum. This indecomposable remainder has $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. Since $c$ is the maximum possible number of composants for any continuum, this is the maximum possible number in this case as well.\n\nThe maximum possible number of composants is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<$2^{\\aleph_0}$>>>"
