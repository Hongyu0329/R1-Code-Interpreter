    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron and its Orientation**\n*   An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron made up of 20 identical equilateral triangle faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   A key property of the icosahedron (like all Platonic solids) is its high degree of symmetry. It has a center of symmetry, meaning that for any point on its surface, there is an identical point on the opposite side, found by drawing a line through the center of the solid. This implies that for every face, there is a parallel face on the opposite side.\n*   The problem states the icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces\". This sets the orientation: one of its triangular faces is horizontal and forms the base. Due to the symmetry mentioned above, there is a corresponding parallel triangular face at the top.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Location of the Water Surface**\n*   The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, any plane that passes through its geometric center will divide the solid's volume into two equal halves.\n*   The surface of water in a container under gravity is always a horizontal plane.\n*   Combining these facts, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the exact geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Water Surface Plane to the Icosahedron's Structure**\n*   The water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron.\n*   The base of the icosahedron is also a horizontal plane (a triangular face).\n*   Therefore, the water surface forms a cross-section of the icosahedron that is parallel to its base and top faces, located exactly midway between them.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   To find the shape of the water surface, we need to determine the shape of this central cross-section.\n*   Imagine looking down at the icosahedron from directly above. The outline you would see is the projection of the widest part of the solid. In this orientation (standing on a face), the widest part is an \"equator\" of 6 vertices.\n*   The central slicing plane intersects the edges that connect the lower half of the icosahedron to the upper half.\n*   In this specific orientation, there is a \"belt\" of 6 edges that zig-zag around the middle of the icosahedron. The horizontal plane passing through the center intersects each of these 6 edges.\n*   Because the plane is central and the icosahedron is perfectly symmetric, the plane cuts each of these 6 edges at its exact midpoint.\n*   The points of intersection (the vertices of the shape of the water surface) will form a regular polygon due to the high symmetry of the icosahedron.\n*   Since the plane cuts 6 edges, the resulting polygon has 6 vertices. A regular 6-sided polygon is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhen the icosahedron tank is half-filled, the water surface is a plane passing through the center, parallel to the base. This cross-section of an icosahedron is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
