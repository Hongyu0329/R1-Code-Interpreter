    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Context:** Painted after an escape/release from the Gestapo (or early Nazi authorities).\n*   **Question:** What object is he holding, and what does it symbolize as an act of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork and its context.**\nThe painting in question is one of Curt Querner's most famous works, often titled *Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife* (Self-Portrait with Pipe), created in 1933. Querner, who was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), was arrested and severely beaten by the Nazi SA (Sturmabteilung) in Dresden in March 1933. This self-portrait was painted immediately following his release, and it unflinchingly depicts his swollen and bruised face.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the object held by the artist in the portrait.**\nBy examining the painting *Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife*, it is clear that Curt Querner is holding a smoking pipe in his mouth.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object within the given context.**\n*   **The Act of Defiance:** The most striking feature of the portrait is Querner's battered face, a direct result of Nazi brutality. By painting himself engaged in the mundane, everyday act of smoking a pipe, he creates a powerful contrast. This act serves as a symbol of his unbroken spirit. It suggests that despite the physical violence inflicted upon him, his inner self, his resolve, and his identity remain intact.\n*   **Resilience and \"Trotz\":** In German, this can be described as a \"Trotz-Haltung\"â€”an attitude of defiance or \"in spite of.\" In spite of the pain and humiliation, he calmly smokes his pipe. It's an assertion of personal dignity and a refusal to be psychologically defeated by his persecutors.\n*   **Reclaiming Normalcy:** The simple ritual of smoking a pipe is a way of reclaiming a small piece of normalcy and humanity in the face of a dehumanizing experience. It is a quiet but powerful act of resistance against the terror intended to break him.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn his 1933 self-portrait, painted after being tortured by the Nazi SA, Curt Querner holds a pipe. This object symbolizes his defiant and unbroken spirit, his personal resilience, and his refusal to be crushed by the regime's brutality.\n\n<<<a pipe>>>"
