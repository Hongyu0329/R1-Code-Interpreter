    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nThe question asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the set of integers $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ where $N = 823564528378596$. The set is ordered by the divisibility relation, forming a partially ordered set (poset), often called the divisor poset.\n\n*   **Poset:** A set with a partial order relation. Here, the set is $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ and the relation is 'divides' (e.g., $a \\le b$ if $a|b$).\n*   **Antichain:** A subset of $S$ where no two distinct elements are related. In this case, for any two numbers $a, b$ in an antichain, neither $a|b$ nor $b|a$.\n*   **Chain:** A subset of $S$ where all elements are totally ordered. In this case, a set of numbers $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k\\}$ is a chain if $x_1 | x_2 | \\dots | x_k$. The length of this chain is $k$.\n*   **Union of 20 Antichains:** A subset $A \\subseteq S$ that can be written as $A = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup A_{20}$, where each $A_i$ is an antichain.\n\n### Step 2: Connection to Chain Length using Dual of Dilworth's Theorem\n\nA key result in poset theory connects the decomposition of a set into antichains with the length of the longest chain within that set. A generalization of Mirsky's Theorem (the dual of Dilworth's Theorem) states:\n\nA subset $A$ of a poset can be expressed as a union of $k$ antichains if and only if the longest chain in $A$ has a length of at most $k$.\n\nIn our problem, $k=20$. So, we are looking for the largest subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ that contains no chain of length 21.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing the Set of Numbers with Long Chains\n\nLet's define the \"length\" of a number $n \\in S$, denoted as length($n$), to be the length of the longest chain in the poset $S$ that starts with $n$.\nA chain of length $m$ starting with $n$ is a sequence $n=x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m$ where $x_i \\in S$ for all $i$ and $x_1 | x_2 | \\dots | x_m$.\n\nThe problem is now to find the size of the largest subset $A \\subseteq S$ such that for any chain $c \\subseteq A$, the length of $c$ is at most 20.\n\nConsider the set $U_{20} = \\{n \\in S \\mid \\text{length}(n) \\le 20\\}$.\nAny chain in $U_{20}$ starting with an element $x_1$ has its length bounded by length($x_1$), which is at most 20. A non-starting element in a chain has an even shorter max-length chain starting from it. Let $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m$ be a chain. Then length($x_1$) > length($x_2$) > ... > length($x_m$). If all $x_i \\in U_{20}$, then length($x_1$) $\\le 20$, which implies $m \\le 20$. So $U_{20}$ contains no chain of length 21.\n\nIt is a known result from poset theory that $U_k$ is the largest such set. The size of the set we're looking for is $|U_{20}|$.\nCalculating $|U_{20}|$ is easier by computing the size of its complement: $|S| - |\\{n \\in S \\mid \\text{length}(n) > 20\\}|$.\nThe condition length($n$) > 20 is equivalent to length($n$) $\\ge 21$.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying Numbers with Long Chains\n\nAn integer $n \\in S$ has length($n$) $\\ge 21$ if and only if there exists a chain $n=x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{21}$ with all $x_i \\in S$.\nFor such a chain to exist, we must have $x_1 | x_2 | \\dots | x_{21}$. Since all elements are distinct integers, for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 20\\}$, $x_{i+1}$ must be a multiple of $x_i$, so $x_{i+1} = c_i x_i$ for some integer $c_i \\ge 2$.\n\nThis gives a lower bound on the last element of the chain:\n$x_{21} = c_{20} x_{20} = c_{20} c_{19} x_{19} = \\dots = (c_1 c_2 \\dots c_{20}) x_1$.\nSince each $c_i \\ge 2$, their product is at least $2^{20}$.\nSo, $x_{21} \\ge 2^{20} x_1 = 2^{20} n$.\n\nSince every element of the chain must be in $S = \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, we must have $x_{21} \\le N$.\nCombining these, we get $2^{20} n \\le N$, which implies $n \\le N / 2^{20}$.\nThis shows that any number $n$ with length($n$) $\\ge 21$ must satisfy $n \\le \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n\nNow, let's check the other direction. Let $n$ be an integer such that $1 \\le n \\le \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\nCan we construct a chain of length 21 starting with $n$?\nConsider the sequence: $n, 2n, 4n, \\dots, 2^{20}n$.\nThis is a sequence of $21$ distinct numbers.\nLet $x_i = 2^{i-1} n$ for $i=1, \\dots, 21$.\nFor any $i$, $x_i = 2^{i-1} n | 2^i n = x_{i+1}$. So this is a chain.\nWe must verify that all elements of this chain are in $S$. The largest element is $x_{21} = 2^{20} n$.\nSince we assumed $n \\le \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$, we have $n \\le N/2^{20}$, which means $2^{20}n \\le N$.\nAll other elements in the chain are smaller than $x_{21}$, so they are also less than or equal to $N$.\nThus, for any $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor\\}$, length($n$) is at least 21.\n\nSo, the set of numbers $\\{n \\in S \\mid \\text{length}(n) \\ge 21\\}$ is precisely $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor\\}$.\nThe size of this set is $\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculation\n\nThe size of the largest union of 20 antichains is:\n$|U_{20}| = N - |\\{n \\in S \\mid \\text{length}(n) \\ge 21\\}| = N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n\nLet's compute the values:\n*   $N = 823564528378596$\n*   $2^{10} = 1024$\n*   $2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = 1024^2 = 1048576$\n\nNow, we perform the integer division:\n$\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 823564528378596 / 1048576 \\rfloor$\n\n$823564528378596 \\div 1048576 = 785412847.9...$\n\nSo, $\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor = 785412847$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the size of the desired set:\n$N - 785412847 = 823564528378596 - 785412847 = 823563742965749$.\n\nThe specific prime factorization of $N$ ($N = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 71$) is irrelevant to this method, which works for any integer $N$. It serves to uniquely define the number $N$ for the problem.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe largest union of 20 antichains is a set of size $N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\nThe final calculation gives:\n$823564528378596 - 785412847 = 823563742965749$.\n\n<<<823563742965749>>>"
