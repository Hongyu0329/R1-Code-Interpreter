    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the core problem:**\nThe question asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is context that identifies this specific matrix `A`. Since the matrix is explicitly provided, we can proceed directly with the calculation of its determinant.\n\n**2. List Careful Points and Observations:**\n*   **Linear Dependence:** A crucial property to look for in a matrix before computing its determinant is linear dependence among its rows or columns. If rows or columns are linearly dependent, the determinant is zero.\n*   **Row Sums:** Let's calculate the sum of the elements in each row of matrix A.\n    *   Sum of Row 1: \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Sum of Row 2: \\( -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Sum of Row 3: \\( -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n*   **Column Sums:** Since the matrix is symmetric, the sum of elements in each column is also zero.\n    *   Sum of Column 1: \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Sum of Column 2: \\( -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Sum of Column 3: \\( -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n*   **Implication of Zero Sums:** The fact that the sum of the columns is the zero vector means the columns are linearly dependent. Specifically, if we denote the columns as \\( \\mathbf{c_1}, \\mathbf{c_2}, \\mathbf{c_3} \\), we have \\( \\mathbf{c_1} + \\mathbf{c_2} + \\mathbf{c_3} = \\mathbf{0} \\). This is a linear combination of the columns that equals the zero vector, with coefficients (1, 1, 1) not all being zero.\n*   **Fundamental Theorem:** A square matrix has a determinant of zero if and only if its column vectors (or row vectors) are linearly dependent.\n*   **Conclusion from observation:** Based on this property, we can immediately conclude that the determinant of matrix A must be 0.\n\n**3. Verification through Direct Calculation (Cofactor Expansion):**\nTo be absolutely certain, we can compute the determinant using the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix. The determinant of \\( A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\) is \\( a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\).\n\nFor our matrix \\(A\\):\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n*   First minor determinant: \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   Second minor determinant: \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   Third minor determinant: \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 3 \\)\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the main formula:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2(3) - (-1)(-3) - 1(3)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 0\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm the result. The analysis shows that the matrix is singular, and its determinant is 0.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<0>>>"
