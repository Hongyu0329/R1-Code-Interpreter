    "This is a theoretical question about game mechanics, which can be answered by analyzing the mathematical formulas used in the game's code.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:** First, we need the standard, non-Expert Mode health of the Eye of Cthulhu. According to the Terraria source code, the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu is **2,800 HP**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Expert Mode Multiplier:** In Expert Mode, the health of all bosses is multiplied by a specific factor. This factor, referred to in the code as `Main.expertNPCHitpointsScale`, is **2.0**.\n    *   Single-player Expert Mode health = Base Health × 2.0 = 2,800 × 2.0 = **5,600 HP**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Multiplayer Health Scaling:** In Expert Mode, boss health increases further based on the number of players in the world. This mechanic ensures the boss remains a challenge for larger groups. The formula for this health multiplier, based on the number of players (`P`), is:\n    *   Multiplayer Multiplier = `1 + (P - 1) * 0.35`\n    *   This formula adds a 35% health bonus (based on the initial Expert health) for each player after the first. For a single player (`P=1`), the multiplier is `1 + (1 - 1) * 0.35 = 1.0`, so there is no change. For two players (`P=2`), the multiplier is `1.35`, and so on.\n\n4.  **Create the Final Health Formula:** Now we can combine these parts into a single formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's total health in Expert Mode for `P` players.\n    *   Total Health(`P`) = (Base Health) × (Expert Mode Multiplier) × (Multiplayer Multiplier)\n    *   Total Health(`P`) = 2,800 × 2.0 × (1 + (P - 1) × 0.35)\n    *   Total Health(`P`) = 5,600 × (1 + 0.35P - 0.35)\n    *   Total Health(`P`) = 5,600 × (0.65 + 0.35P)\n    *   This can be expanded to the linear equation: Total Health(`P`) = 3,640 + 1,960P\n\n5.  **Calculate the Theoretical Maximum for Infinite Players:** The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This means we must find the limit of the health formula as `P` approaches infinity (lim P→∞).\n    *   `lim (P→∞) [3,640 + 1,960P]`\n    *   In this linear function, as `P` increases without any upper limit, the term `1,960P` also increases without any limit. The constant `3,640` becomes insignificant in comparison.\n    *   Therefore, the value of the function approaches infinity.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Theoretical vs. Practical:** The question is purely theoretical. In a real game, the number of players is capped (at 255), and the health value is capped by the maximum value of a 32-bit integer (`2,147,483,647`). The prompt's use of \"infinite number of players\" requires us to ignore these practical engine limitations and follow the logic of the formula.\n*   **Linear Scaling:** The key takeaway is that the health scales linearly with the player count. A linear function with a positive slope (`1,960`) is unbounded, meaning it does not have a maximum value.\n\nBased on the unbounded linear scaling of boss health per player in Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health with an infinite number of players is also infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
