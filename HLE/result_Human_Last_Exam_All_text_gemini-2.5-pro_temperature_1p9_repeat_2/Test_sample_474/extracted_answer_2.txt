The approach is not valid. The ecological function of bumblebee mimicry is dependent on the perception of their primary predators, which are mainly birds. Avian vision is fundamentally different from human vision; most importantly, birds can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Two species that appear identical to a human may have different UV patterns, allowing birds to distinguish them easily. Therefore, they would not belong to the same functional mimicry ring. By relying on human undergraduates, the study is measuring similarity to humans, not similarity to the predators that actually drive the evolution and maintenance of mimicry syndromes. Thus, the resulting clusters may not reflect the true, ecologically functional mimicry groups.
