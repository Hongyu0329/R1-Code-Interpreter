    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the very first statute passed by the modern State of Israel that explicitly contained the concept of \"good faith\".\nKey elements to consider:\n*   **\"first statute\"**: This requires chronological accuracy. We are looking for the earliest law that meets the criteria.\n*   **\"modern State of Israel\"**: This sets the time frame to laws passed after Israel's independence in 1948. This excludes laws from the British Mandate or the Ottoman Empire that were inherited, even if they were later re-enacted. The focus is on new, original Israeli legislation.\n*   **\"explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must use the words \"good faith\" or its Hebrew equivalent (\"תום לב\", *tom lev*). The concept cannot merely be implied or established later through judicial interpretation of that statute.\n*   **Formatting requirements**: The final answer must not include \"the\" at the beginning or the year of the statute.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nThe concept of \"good faith\" is a cornerstone of modern Israeli civil law, particularly contract law. Several major statutes are famous for this principle.\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**: This is perhaps the most famous example. Its sections 12 (good faith in negotiation) and 39 (good faith in performance of contract) are seminal. However, its year, 1973, suggests it might not be the absolute first.\n*   **Sale Law, 1968**: This law also explicitly requires good faith. Section 6 states that rights and obligations from a contract of sale must be exercised and fulfilled in the customary manner and in good faith. This predates the Contracts Law of 1973.\n*   **Agency Law, 1965**: This law governs the relationship between a principal and an agent. A review of this statute shows that it also explicitly uses the concept. For instance, it addresses the protection of a third party who dealt with an agent in \"good faith\" (*be-tom lev*). This law predates both the Sale Law (1968) and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Candidates and Select the First**\nComparing the dates of these key pieces of legislation:\n*   Agency Law: 1965\n*   Sale Law: 1968\n*   Contracts (General Part) Law: 1973\n\nThe Agency Law was enacted in 1965, making it earlier than the other two major statutes that explicitly enshrined the good faith principle. While some inherited Mandate-era laws (like the Bills of Exchange Ordinance) used a similar concept, the Agency Law is considered a primary example of an *original* statute of the modern State of Israel that began the process of codifying and introducing this principle into its new body of civil law. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formatting**\nThe question requires the name of the statute without the definite article (\"the\") and without the year.\n*   Correct Statute: Agency Law, 1965\n*   Formatted Answer: Agency Law\n\n<<<Agency Law>>>"
