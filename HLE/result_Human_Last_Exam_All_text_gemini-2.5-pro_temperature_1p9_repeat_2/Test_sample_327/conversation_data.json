    "This problem asks for the number of red and blue pieces required to represent the dyadic rational number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in the game of Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Represent the number in binary:**\n    First, we express the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ as a sum of powers of $\\frac{1}{2}$, which is equivalent to finding its binary representation.\n    $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8 + 4 + 1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{0}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$\n    In binary form, this is $0.1101_2$.\n\n2.  **Use the additive property of Hackenbush games:**\n    A fundamental property of combinatorial games, including Hackenbush, is that the value of a position consisting of several disjoint (side-by-side) games is the sum of the values of the individual games.\n    So, the Hackenbush representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the disjoint union of the games for $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    $H\\left(\\frac{13}{16}\\right) = H\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + H\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + H\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)$\n    The total number of pieces will be the sum of the pieces used for each of these component games.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of pieces for each component game $H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right)$:**\n    There is a standard, canonical construction for games with values of the form $\\frac{1}{2^k}$.\n    *   **For $k=1$: $H\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$**\n        The game with value $\\frac{1}{2}$ is represented by a single blue piece (stalk) placed on top of a single red piece. This game has 1 red piece and 1 blue piece.\n        Total pieces = 2.\n    *   **For $k=2$: $H\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$**\n        The game for $\\frac{1}{4}$ is constructed recursively. It consists of the game for $\\frac{1}{2}$ placed on top of a blue-on-red structure. This forms a single stack of 4 alternating pieces (blue on red on blue on red). It consists of 2 red pieces and 2 blue pieces.\n        Total pieces = 4.\n    *   **Generalizing for $H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right)$:**\n        The canonical game for $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ is built by a recursive process. The game for $H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{k+1}}\\right)$ is constructed by placing the game for $H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right)$ on top of a blue-on-red structure. This means that the number of pieces follows a simple arithmetic progression:\n        Number of pieces for $H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right)$ = Number of pieces for $H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}\\right) + 2$.\n        Starting with $H(\\frac{1}{2})$ having 2 pieces, the number of pieces for $H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right)$ is $2k$. Each such game has $k$ red pieces and $k$ blue pieces.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of pieces for the required components:**\n    *   For $H\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^1}\\right)$, $k=1$. Number of pieces = $2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n    *   For $H\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^2}\\right)$, $k=2$. Number of pieces = $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   For $H\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) = H\\left(\\frac{1}{2^4}\\right)$, $k=4$. Number of pieces = $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n5.  **Sum the pieces to find the total:**\n    Total number of pieces = (pieces for $\\frac{1}{2}$) + (pieces for $\\frac{1}{4}$) + (pieces for $\\frac{1}{16}$)\n    Total number of pieces = $2 + 4 + 8 = 14$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The representation of a number must be the canonical one. For dyadic rationals, this corresponds to the standard binary expansion ($13/16=0.1101_2$, not something like $1 - 3/16$).\n*   The additive property of games is crucial, allowing us to consider the binary components separately.\n*   The number of pieces for the fundamental games $H(1/2^k)$ follows a well-established pattern ($2k$). Miscalculating the value of these game structures is easy, but the construction and resulting piece count are standard.\n\nFinal calculation is summing the pieces needed for each term in the binary expansion of the number.\nThe total number of pieces needed is $2+4+8 = 14$."
