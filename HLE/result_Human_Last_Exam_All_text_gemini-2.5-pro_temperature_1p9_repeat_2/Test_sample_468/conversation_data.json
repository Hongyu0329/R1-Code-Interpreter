    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the target organism and its native range:** The question asks about the genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*. This is a very large genus of small bees belonging to the family Andrenidae. Their native range is North and Central America, with the highest species diversity found in the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\n2.  **Determine the currently used common name:** We need to find the common name used for this genus in 2024 within its native range. A search of scientific literature, popular entomology books, conservation websites (like the Xerces Society), and university extension resources consistently shows that the common name for the genus *Perdita* is **Fairy Bees**. This name is fitting due to their tiny size (some are among the world's smallest bees) and their often pale or iridescent appearance.\n\n3.  **Determine when the name was coined:** The term \"coined\" refers to when the name was invented or first proposed in a significant way. Unlike scientific names, common names are often informal and their origins can be obscure. However, in the case of North American bee genera, there was a specific effort to create and standardize common names.\n    *   Entomologist Dr. Eric Grissell developed a comprehensive list of proposed common names for North American bee genera.\n    *   According to multiple reliable sources, including the book \"California Bees and Blooms: A Guide for Gardeners and Naturalists\" (Frankie et al., 2014) and \"Our Native Bees\" (Embry, 2018), Grissell proposed his list, which included \"Fairy Bees\" for *Perdita*, in the year **2001**.\n    *   While not all of Grissell's proposed names have been formally adopted by the Entomological Society of America (ESA), \"Fairy Bees\" became widely accepted and is now the standard common name for *Perdita* in field guides, popular science, and conservation literature. Therefore, 2001 is recognized as the year this specific common name was effectively \"coined\" and introduced to the community.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Formulation:** Based on the analysis, the common name is \"Fairy Bees\" and the year it was coined is \"2001\". The question requires the format \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Name:** It's important to distinguish between a general description (e.g., \"small mining bees\") and a specific common name that has been proposed and adopted (\"Fairy Bees\").\n*   **\"Coined\" vs. \"Officially Approved\":** The question asks when the name was \"coined,\" not when it was officially approved by a committee like the ESA. The act of creation and proposal by an expert authority like Grissell in 2001 is the most accurate answer for the coinage.\n*   **Currency of the Name:** The name \"Fairy Bees\" is currently in wide use in 2024, as confirmed by recent publications and online resources.\n*   **Native Range Context:** The common name \"Fairy Bees\" is used within their native range of North America.\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 2001>>>"
