No. It is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics deals with physical observables and states of physical systems, while Gödel's ontological proof operates within the abstract realm of modal logic and metaphysics. The core concepts of Gödel's proof, such as "positive properties" and "necessary existence," have no representation or equivalent within the mathematical language of quantum mechanics (e.g., as operators on a Hilbert space). It is a category error to attempt to use the tools of a physical theory to prove a theorem of formal metaphysics.
