    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**\n\nThe problem describes a triangle $A B C$ where we are given one side $BC$, the angle adjacent to it $\\angle B$, and we are considering various lengths for the side opposite to $\\angle B$, which is $AC$. This is a classic Side-Side-Angle (SSA) configuration. The question asks for the number of integer lengths of side $AC$ that result in there being exactly two possible lengths for the third side, $AB$.\n\n**Step 2: The Condition for Two Triangles (The Ambiguous Case)**\n\nThe existence of two possible triangles in the SSA case is known as the \"ambiguous case\". Let's analyze this geometrically and trigonometrically.\n\n*   Let $a = BC = S$, $b = AC$, and $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n*   Let $h$ be the length of the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$. In the right triangle formed by this altitude, we have $\\sin B = h/a$, which means $h = a \\sin B$.\n*   For a triangle $ABC$ to exist, side $AC$ (with length $b$) must be at least as long as this altitude $h$.\n    *   If $b < h$, side $AC$ is too short to reach the line containing $AB$, so no triangle can be formed.\n    *   If $b = h$, side $AC$ is exactly the length of the altitude. This forms a unique right-angled triangle where $\\angle A = 90^{\\circ}$. So, there is only one possible triangle.\n    *   If $b > h$, side $AC$ can intersect the line containing $AB$ at one or two points.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** For two distinct triangles to be formed, side $AC$ must be long enough to intersect the line containing $AB$ at two points, but not so long that one of the intersection points lies on the wrong side of vertex B. This happens precisely when the length of side $AC$ is strictly greater than the altitude $h$ and strictly less than the length of the other given side, $BC$.\n\nSo, the condition for two possible values for side length $AB$ is $h < b < a$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Given Values to Find the Inequality**\n\nWe substitute the given values into the condition derived in Step 2:\n\n*   $a = BC = S$\n*   $b = AC$\n*   $h = a \\sin B = S \\sin(30^{\\circ})$\n*   Since $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 1/2$, the altitude is $h = S/2$.\n\nThe inequality $h < b < a$ becomes:\n$S/2 < AC < S$\n\n**Step 4: Count the Number of Integer Values for AC**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of $AC$ that satisfy the inequality $S/2 < AC < S$. Let's call this number $N$. To find $N$, we need to count the integers in the open interval $(S/2, S)$.\n\n*   The smallest integer strictly greater than $S/2$ is $\\lfloor S/2 \\rfloor + 1$.\n*   The largest integer strictly less than $S$ is $S-1$ (assuming $S$ is an integer, which is a reasonable assumption for a side length given as a named variable).\n\nThe number of integers $N$ is the count from $\\lfloor S/2 \\rfloor + 1$ to $S-1$.\n$N = (S-1) - (\\lfloor S/2 \\rfloor + 1) + 1 = S - 1 - \\lfloor S/2 \\rfloor$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Let's analyze this formula for even and odd values of S.\n*   **Case 1: S is an even integer.** Let $S = 2k$ for some integer $k$.\n    The inequality is $2k/2 < AC < 2k$, which simplifies to $k < AC < 2k$.\n    The integers for $AC$ are $k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 2k-1$.\n    The number of these integers is $N = (2k-1) - (k+1) + 1 = k-1$.\n    Since $k=S/2$, we have $N = S/2 - 1$.\n*   **Case 2: S is an odd integer.** Let $S = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$.\n    The inequality is $(2k+1)/2 < AC < 2k+1$, which simplifies to $k+0.5 < AC < 2k+1$.\n    The integers for $AC$ are $k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 2k$.\n    The number of these integers is $N = 2k - (k+1) + 1 = k$.\n    Since $k=(S-1)/2$, we have $N = (S-1)/2$.\n\nA single formula that covers both cases is $N = \\lfloor(S-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Value of S and Compute the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem states $S=SNYWR$. This is a variable whose value is not provided in the prompt. To find a numerical answer, we must know the value of $S$. Let's assume a common value used in such contest problems, for instance, $S=84$.\n\n*   Since $S=84$ is an even number, we use the formula $N = S/2 - 1$.\n*   $N = 84/2 - 1 = 42 - 1 = 41$.\n\nAlternatively, using the general formula:\n*   $N = \\lfloor(84-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor 83/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 41.5 \\rfloor = 41$.\n\nThus, for $S=84$, there are 41 possible integer values for AC.\n\n<<<41>>>"
