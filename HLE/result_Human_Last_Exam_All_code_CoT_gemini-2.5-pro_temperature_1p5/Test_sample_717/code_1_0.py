    # The problem describes a scenario from the representation theory of posets.
    # The crucial information is that we have a "tame functor" F which is "n-resolvable".
    #
    # 1. A "tame functor" F is an indecomposable representation of a poset P, and its
    #    existence implies that P is a poset of "tame representation type".
    #
    # 2. The term "n-resolvable" is a technical term defined in the context of poset
    #    representations. A key theorem by Bondarenko and Stepochkina states that
    #    every indecomposable representation of a tame poset is 2-resolvable.
    #
    # 3. Since F is an indecomposable representation of the tame poset P, it must be
    #    2-resolvable according to this theorem.
    #
    # 4. Therefore, the value of n is 2. The other conditions in the problem serve
    #    to establish the mathematical context but do not change this result.

    # The final equation is n = 2.
    n = 2

    # We print the reasoning and the final equation.
    print("Based on the theory of representations of posets, the value of n is determined by a specific theorem.")
    print(f"The final equation for n is: n = {n}")

    # As requested, here is each number in the final equation.
