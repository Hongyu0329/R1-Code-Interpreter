    print("- In CDH, abdominal organs herniate into the chest cavity, compressing the lung.")

    print("\nStep 3: Identify the underlying anatomical defect for a CDH.")
    print("- A congenital diaphragmatic hernia is most commonly caused by a failure of the pleuroperitoneal membrane to fuse properly during development.")

    print("- The macrosomia ({weight_lb} lb {weight_oz} oz baby) and micrognathia are important clues pointing to a likely underlying cause, such as maternal diabetes (Answer D). Maternal diabetes is a risk factor for CDH.")
    print("- However, the question asks for the 'most likely anatomical defect' in the patient, not the maternal condition or a consequence like pulmonary hypoplasia.")
