def solve_domain_model_problem():
    """
    Analyzes the provided options for implementing a domain model and identifies the inappropriate ones.

    The analysis is based on Martin Fowler's description of the Domain Model pattern,
    which favors rich domain objects that encapsulate both data and behavior.

    - Option A: Putting business logic in a Controller is the 'Fat Controller' anti-pattern.
      The controller's role is to handle requests and delegate, not to contain business rules.
      This is inappropriate.

    - Option B: Putting all logic into the Order class creates a 'God Object' and violates
      the Single Responsibility Principle. Logic like customer discount calculation belongs to the
      Customer entity, not the Order. This is inappropriate.

    - Option C: Distributing logic to the most relevant entities (Customer for discounts,
      Book for inventory) is the core idea of a rich Domain Model. This is an appropriate design.

    - Option D: Putting all logic into a service leads to an 'Anemic Domain Model' anti-pattern,
      where domain objects are just bags of data. This is inappropriate.

    - Option E: A hybrid approach where entities have their own intrinsic logic and domain
      services orchestrate complex operations across multiple entities is a common and robust
      pattern in Domain-Driven Design. This is an appropriate design.

    The inappropriate implementations are A, B, and D.
