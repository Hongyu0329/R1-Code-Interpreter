def solve_fourier_restriction_exponent():
    """
    This function calculates the smallest possible value of c based on the
    problem description.

    The derivation is as follows:
    1. The problem is a Fourier restriction problem on algebraic curves.
    2. A scaling argument transforms the problem into estimating the decay of a
       Fourier integral operator with a large parameter lambda = R^2. The
       inequality becomes norm <= lambda^(c-1) * other_terms.
    3. The decay rate of the Fourier transform of a measure on an algebraic
       curve is limited by its degree. The Fourier transform of a measure on
       a curve with maximal order of contact k decays like |eta|^(-1/k).
    4. For an algebraic curve of degree d, the maximal order of contact k
       with a line is at most d. The problem gives a maximal degree of 100.
    5. The L^2 norm on the left-hand side of the scaled inequality involves
       the square of the Fourier transform, so it decays like lambda^(-2/k).
    6. To find the sharp exponent c, we must consider the worst case, which
       is the slowest decay, corresponding to the largest possible k. Here,
       the maximum degree is 100, so k_max = 100.
    7. The relationship lambda^(-2/k_max) <= lambda^(c-1) must hold.
    8. This implies the inequality on the exponents: -2/k_max <= c - 1,
       which gives c >= 1 - 2/k_max. The smallest possible value for c is
       therefore 1 - 2/k_max.
