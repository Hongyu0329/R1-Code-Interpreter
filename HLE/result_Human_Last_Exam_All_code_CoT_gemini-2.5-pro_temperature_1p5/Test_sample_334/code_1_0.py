  Analyzes the cybersecurity requirements and selects the best solution.

  The problem states that biometric authentication is vulnerable because biometric traits
  are unique but not secret. The solution must address four key requirements:
  1. Prevention of spoofing and replay attacks.
  2. An unwilling (coerced) user will NOT authenticate.
  3. The system remains secure even if the biometric data is stolen.
  4. The solution is applicable to a wide range of biometric types.

  Let's evaluate the winning option:
  I. Strong Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): This approach augments biometrics ("something you are") with other authentication factors, like a PIN ("something you know") and a hardware token ("something you have").

  - Analysis against requirements:
  1. Spoofing/Replay Prevention: Met. An attacker who spoofs the biometric still needs the PIN and the hardware token. The system is not compromised by a single point of failure.
  2. Duress/Coercion Prevention: Met. The system can be designed with a special "duress PIN" which appears to work but silently triggers an alarm. The description explicitly mentions it "prevents unauthorized use under duress scenarios."
  3. Resilience to Data Exposure: Met. If the database of biometric templates is stolen, it is useless to an attacker without the other authentication factors. The other factors are also revocable (PIN can be changed, token can be deactivated).
  4. Multi-Modality Support: Met. This architectural approach is independent of the specific biometric modality used. It can be paired with face, fingerprint, voice, etc.

  This solution is the best fit because it directly addresses the core weakness of biometrics (being a single, non-secret factor) by applying the fundamental security principle of defense-in-depth.

  The best solution is I: Strong Multi-Factor Authentication.

  Here's why it meets all the requirements:
  - Requirement 1 (Spoofing/Replay): An attacker with a spoofed biometric is stopped because they also need the secret PIN and the physical hardware token.
  - Requirement 2 (Duress): The system can use a duress PIN or protocol to detect coercion, as mentioned in the description. An unwilling user can enter a specific code that denies access while appearing to cooperate.
  - Requirement 3 (Data Exposure): Stolen biometric data is insufficient for a breach. The security of the system relies on all three factors, and the PIN and token are revocable.
  - Requirement 4 (Multi-modality): This solution is an architectural approach that complements any type of biometric authentication.
