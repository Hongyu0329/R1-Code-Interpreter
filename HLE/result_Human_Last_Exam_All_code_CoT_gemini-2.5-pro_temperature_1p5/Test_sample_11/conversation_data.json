    "My plan is to identify the correct Israeli statute by searching through legal history for the introduction of the \"good faith\" principle. The key is to find the first piece of legislation that codified this concept in a general and explicit manner, which was a major shift in Israeli private law. I will then create a Python script to print the name of this statute as requested, omitting \"the\" and the year.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_statute():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the first statute in the modern State of Israel\n  to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n  \"\"\"\n  # The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973 is widely recognized by legal scholars\n  # as the first major Israeli statute to explicitly and generally introduce the\n  # principle of \"good faith\" (tom lev) into Israeli law, particularly in its\n  # famous sections 12 (good faith in negotiation) and 39 (good faith in performance).\n  statute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n  print(statute_name)\n\nfind_first_statute()\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
