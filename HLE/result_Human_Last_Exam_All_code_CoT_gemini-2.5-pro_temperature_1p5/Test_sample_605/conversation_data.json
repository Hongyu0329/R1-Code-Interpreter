    "To determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Weights and Number of Variables:** The ambient space is a 4-dimensional weighted projective space, $\\mathbb{P}^4$, which means there are $n=5$ complex variables ($z_1, ..., z_5$). The corresponding weights are given as $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d):** A polynomial is called quasi-homogeneous or weighted homogeneous if all its monomials have the same weighted degree. We calculate this for each term in the given polynomial $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$:\n    *   deg($z_1^8z_3$) = $8 \\cdot 22 + 1 \\cdot 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n    *   deg($z_1^4z_2^3z_3$) = $4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 1 \\cdot 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$\n    *   deg($z_1z_2^7$) = $1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$\n    All other terms also have a weighted degree of 225. The second term's degree is anomalous, strongly suggesting a typo in the problem statement. For the hypersurface to be a well-defined Calabi-Yau manifold, the polynomial must be quasi-homogeneous, and its degree `d` must equal the sum of the weights. Let's check the sum of weights: $d = \\sum w_i = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$. This confirms that the intended degree of the polynomial is `d = 225`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the link of a Calabi-Yau cone defined by a polynomial of degree `d` in $\\mathbb{P}^{n-1}(w_1, ..., w_n)$ is given by the formula:\n    $$cn = \\frac{d^{n-1}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$\n\n4.  **Calculate and Simplify:** I will now write a Python script to substitute the values ($d=225$, $n=5$, and the given weights) into the formula. The script will compute the numerator ($225^{5-1} = 225^4$) and the denominator ($22 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 75$), and then simplify the resulting fraction to its lowest terms. The script will print the entire calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define weights and number of variables\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    n = len(weights)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the degree 'd'\n    # Based on the analysis in the text above, the degree is 225.\n    d = 225\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Apply the formula and calculate\n    # Numerator is d^(n-1)\n    # Denominator is the product of weights\n    \n    numerator = d**(n - 1)\n    \n    denominator = 1\n    for w in weights:\n        denominator *= w\n\n    # Simplify the fraction by dividing by the greatest common divisor (GCD)\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n    simplified_numerator = numerator // common_divisor\n    simplified_denominator = denominator // common_divisor\n\n    # Step 5: Present the result\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is calculated using the formula: d^(n-1) / (w1 * ... * wn)\")\n    print(f\"For degree d = {d} and n = {n} variables with weights = {weights}, the equation is:\")\n    \n    # Building the string for the denominator product\n    denominator_str = \" * \".join(map(str, weights))\n    \n    print(f\"{d}^{n-1} / ({denominator_str})\")\n    print(f\"= {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"= {simplified_numerator} / {simplified_denominator}\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```\n<<<1366875 / 62524>>>"
