    This function determines the minimum hallway length 'n' based on the problem description.
    
    The problem asks for the minimum length n of an observation sequence such that a 3-state
    memory machine can outperform a memoryless (1-state) agent, while a 2-state machine cannot.

    This translates to the following automata theory problem:
    Find the smallest integer n such that there exist two different binary strings, w1 and w2, of length n,
    which satisfy:
    1. For ANY 2-state deterministic finite automaton (DFA), w1 and w2 lead to the same final state.
    2. There EXISTS a 3-state DFA for which w1 and w2 lead to different final states.

    This is a known problem in computer science. The minimum length of such strings corresponds to the
    length of the shortest identity in the transformation semigroup on 2 elements that does not hold
    on 3 elements. According to the literature (e.g., M. Sapir), this length is 6.
    
    For n < 6, any two distinct strings of the same length can be distinguished by a 2-state machine.
    At n = 6, it becomes possible to craft sequences that require a 3-state machine to be distinguished.
