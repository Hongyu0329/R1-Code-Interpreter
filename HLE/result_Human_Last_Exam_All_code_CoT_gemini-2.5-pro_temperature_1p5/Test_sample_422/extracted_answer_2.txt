1. **The Regress Problem of Justification**: The "Justification" condition is not self-contained. Any attempt to justify a belief requires further justifications, leading to an infinite regress where no ultimate foundation for the justification is ever reached.
2. **The Circularity Problem**: The definition is circular because "Justification" itself often relies on pre-existing knowledge. To justify a belief 'P' with evidence 'E', one must already *know* that 'E' is true and relevant, meaning knowledge is required to satisfy a condition for knowledge.
