    Analyzes the clinical scenario and determines the most appropriate treatment.

    The patient's presentation with necrotic tissue and vital signs indicating shock
    (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea) points to septic shock originating from
    a severe soft tissue infection (like necrotizing fasciitis).

    The pillars of management are:
    1.  Resuscitation with IV Fluids (A) to correct shock.
    2.  Broad-spectrum IV Medication (B), i.e., antibiotics.
    3.  Urgent Surgical Debridement (C) to control the source of infection.

    All three (A, B, C) are critically important and should be initiated nearly simultaneously.
    We must evaluate the given choices:
    - F (A & B): Resuscitation and antibiotics. This stabilizes the patient but does not
      remove the source of the infection, so the patient will not recover.
    - G (B & C): Antibiotics and surgical debridement. This addresses the infection
      systemically and removes the source. This represents the definitive, curative
      treatment plan. While performing surgery on a hypotensive patient is risky,
      delaying surgery in this condition is associated with extremely high mortality.
      Therefore, the combination that includes the definitive surgical intervention is
      the most critical plan.
    """
    # The chosen answer is G, as it combines systemic treatment with the definitive
    # source control (surgery), which is the most critical element for survival in this scenario.

    explanation = "The patient is in septic shock from necrotic tissue. The definitive, life-saving treatment is surgical debridement (C) to remove the source of the infection, combined with intravenous antibiotics (B) to treat the systemic sepsis. While intravenous fluids (A) are also critical for resuscitation, the combination of B & C represents the core, curative strategy."
