    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are a system of partial differential equations that describe fluid flow.\n2.  The symmetries of these equations are transformations of the independent variables (time and space) and dependent variables (velocity and pressure) that leave the form of the equations unchanged.\n3.  These symmetries form a Lie group. The dimension of the Lie group is the number of independent, one-parameter symmetry transformations, which is equivalent to the dimension of its Lie algebra.\n4.  It's a known, though non-trivial, result from the theory of symmetry analysis of differential equations that the full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional. This is due to a \"gauge-like\" symmetry where the pressure `p` can be shifted by an arbitrary function of time `f(t)`.\n5.  However, the question usually refers to the maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra of physically significant symmetries, often called the kinematical invariance group.\n6.  I will write a Python script to list the generators of this finite-dimensional group and sum their counts to find the total dimension. The script will explicitly show each number in the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The full Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional.\")\n    print(\"This arises from the fact that the pressure `p` can be replaced by `p + f(t)` for any arbitrary\")\n    print(\"function `f(t)` of time, as pressure only appears under a spatial gradient in the equations.\")\n    print(\"\\nHowever, the standard question about the 'dimension' refers to the maximal finite-dimensional\")\n    print(\"subalgebra of kinematical symmetries.
