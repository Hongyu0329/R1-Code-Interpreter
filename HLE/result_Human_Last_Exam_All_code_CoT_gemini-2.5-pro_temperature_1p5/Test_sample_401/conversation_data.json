    "This is a theoretical question from the field of point-set topology. To answer it with code, I will create a Python script that explains the reasoning step-by-step and then prints the final numerical answer.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the definition of a \"continuum.\" In standard topology, a continuum is a compact, connected, and Hausdorff space. For such spaces, the number of composants in an indecomposable continuum is always uncountable.\n\nHowever, the prompt's hint \"(not necessarily metric)\" suggests we might consider a more general definition of a continuum as simply a compact and connected space, without the Hausdorff requirement. By dropping the Hausdorff condition, we can escape the consequences of the Baire Category Theorem and construct spaces with a finite number of composants.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, I will show why an indecomposable continuum cannot have just one composant. This holds true for any continuum, Hausdorff or not.\n2.  Next, I will construct a simple non-Hausdorff indecomposable continuum that has exactly two composants.\n3.  Since the number cannot be 1, and I can provide an example for 2, the smallest possible number must be 2.\n4.  The Python code will articulate these steps and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest number of composants\n    an indecomposable continuum can have.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: State the definitions and the key insight ---\n    print(\"Analyzing the topological problem...\")\n    print(\"A 'continuum' is a compact, connected topological space.\")\n    print(\"An 'indecomposable continuum' cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\"A 'composant' of a point x is the union of all proper subcontinua that contain x.\")\n    print(\"The crucial part of the question is that the continuum is 'not necessarily metric',\")\n    print(\"which allows for non-Hausdorff spaces.
