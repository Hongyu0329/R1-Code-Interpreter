    print("  Hypothesis: Assume H can compute Ω.")
    print("    - If H computes Ω, it has successfully performed a computation for Ω.")
    print("    - This directly CONTRADICTS Ω's definition ('Ω cannot be computed by H').")
    print("    - Therefore, the initial hypothesis must be false.")
    print("\n  Logical Conclusion: The hypercomputer H cannot compute Ω.")
    print("    - This conclusion is CONSISTENT with Ω's definition.")

    print("\nStep 3: Relate the logical conclusion to Set S.")
    print("  - Question: Is Ω in S?")
    print("  - We concluded that H cannot compute Ω.")
    print("  - Since H is more powerful than a standard Turing Machine, if H cannot compute Ω, then a standard Turing machine also cannot compute Ω.")
    print("  - By definition, S only contains numbers computable by a Turing machine.")
    print("  - Therefore, Ω is a non-computable number and is NOT in the set S (Ω ∉ S).")

    print("\nStep 4: Analyze why the hypercomputer fails to give this answer.")
    print("  - The problem states that H 'halts without providing a definitive answer'.")
    print("  - Although we logically deduced that Ω ∉ S, H itself cannot output this. Why?")
    print("  - This is the core of the paradox: The self-referential definition creates a statement that is true but unprovable *by the system it refers to* (H).")
    print("  - For H to formally prove 'Ω ∉ S', it must resolve properties of Ω based on its definition. This act of resolution is a form of 'computation' which is forbidden by the definition of Ω.")
    print("  - H is caught in a logical impasse: It 'knows' it cannot compute Ω, but it cannot formalize and output this knowledge as a definitive result without violating the premise.")

    print("\nStep 5: Evaluate the answer choices.")
    print("  - A. Ω is a non-computable number outside the recursively enumerable set S due to its self-referential nature, and the hypercomputer cannot resolve this paradox.")
    print("    - This matches our analysis perfectly. Ω is non-computable (so outside S), and the failure is due to the unresolved paradox.")
    print("  - B. Ω is a computable number...")
    print("    - This is false. If Ω were computable, it would lead to a direct contradiction.")
    print("  - C. The set S is not well-defined...")
    print("    - This is false. The set of computable numbers is a cornerstone of computability theory and is well-defined.")
    print("  - D. Ω ... indicates the existence of a new hierarchy of computation.")
    print("    - While the existence of a number H cannot compute does imply a hierarchy (related to Turing degrees), option A is a more direct and complete explanation of the *specifics* of the problem posed.")
    print("  - E. ...Ω is both inside and outside the set S simultaneously...")
    print("    - This is incorrect. The logic clearly points to Ω being outside S. The issue is provability, not that it's in a state of being both true and false.")
