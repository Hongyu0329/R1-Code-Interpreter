def solve_fourier_extension_problem():

    This function determines the smallest possible dimension n for which the given
    Fourier extension inequality does not hold.

    The problem described is a known one in harmonic analysis, related to the
    endpoint Fourier restriction conjecture for the paraboloid. The inequality is:
    ||Ef||_{L^{2n/(n-1)}(X)} <= C_epsilon * R^epsilon * ||f||_2

    The validity of this inequality depends on the dimension n.
    - For n = 2 (the parabola in R^2), the corresponding estimates (related to
      bilinear restriction and decoupling) are known to hold. The geometric
      constraints in two dimensions are strong enough to prevent the formation of
      effective "hairbrush" counterexamples that would cause the inequality to fail.
    - For n >= 3, it is known that a "hairbrush" counterexample can be constructed.
      This geometric arrangement of wave packets leads to a structural failure of the
      estimate, causing the operator norm to grow polynomially with R, which violates
      the R^epsilon bound.

    Therefore, the behavior changes at n = 3. The inequality holds for n = 2 but
    fails for n = 3. The smallest dimension for which it fails is 3.
