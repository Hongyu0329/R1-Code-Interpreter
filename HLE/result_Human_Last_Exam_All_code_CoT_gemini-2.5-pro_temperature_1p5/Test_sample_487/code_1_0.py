# Step 1: Maximize n, the number of fixed points on the genus 2 curve C.
# The Riemann-Hurwitz formula for an involution psi on a curve C of genus g=2 is:
# 2*g - 2 = 2*(2*g' - 2) + n
# where g' is the genus of the quotient C/psi and n is the number of fixed points.
# 2*2 - 2 = 2*(2*g' - 2) + n  => 2 = 4*g' - 4 + n => n = 6 - 4*g'
# g' can be 0 or 1.
# if g' = 1, n = 6 - 4 = 2
# if g' = 0, n = 6 - 0 = 6
# To maximize n, we choose the hyperelliptic involution (g'=0).

# The number of components m is related to the rank (r_plus) of the invariant lattice H^2(S,Z)^rho
# and the genera (g_i) of the fixed curves by topological formulas.
# The relation is m = g_1 + r_plus - 10, where g_1 is the genus of the single component allowed
# to have genus > 1, and the other components are rational or elliptic curves.
# To maximize m, we must maximize r_plus and g_1.
# The maximal rank for the invariant lattice is r_plus_max = 20.
# The maximal genus for the curve component under these conditions is g1_max = 10.
