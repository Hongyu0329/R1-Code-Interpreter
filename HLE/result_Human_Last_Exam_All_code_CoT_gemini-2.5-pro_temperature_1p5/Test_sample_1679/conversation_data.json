    "To identify the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **List Best Picture Winners:** I'll start by listing the winners chronologically, beginning with the first awards.\n2.  **Identify Key Locations:** The two Luxor Obelisks are in Luxor, Egypt, and the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. I will search for winning films set in or featuring these locations.\n3.  **Analyze Candidates:** I'll examine the winners set in these locations to determine which one was the first to actually show the obelisk on-screen.\n    *   *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set in Paris, but was filmed on studio backlots, and a clear shot of the obelisk is not confirmed.\n    *   *An American in Paris* (1951) is a musical explicitly celebrating the city. It contains prominent, stylized depictions of Parisian landmarks, including a confirmed on-screen appearance of the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde during its famous ballet sequence.\n    *   Later films, such as *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), also feature the obelisk but were released after *An American in Paris*.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The first confirmed winner to depict the obelisk is *An American in Paris*.\n\nI will now write a Python script to automate this chronological search and output the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    This is based on a chronological review of winners and knowledge of their on-screen content.\n    The Luxor Obelisks are located in Paris, France, and Luxor, Egypt.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary of Best Picture winners by the year the award was for.\n    # The list is extensive enough to find the first instance.\n    best_picture_winners = {\n        1928: \"Wings\",\n        1929: \"The Broadway Melody\",\n        1930: \"All Quiet on the Western Front\",\n        1931: \"Cimarron\",\n        1932: \"Grand Hotel\",\n        1933: \"Cavalcade\",\n        1934: \"It Happened One Night\",\n        1935: \"Mutiny on the Bounty\",\n        1936: \"The Great Ziegfeld\",\n        1937: \"The Life of Emile Zola\",\n        1938: \"You Can't Take It with You\",\n        1939: \"Gone with the Wind\",\n        1940: \"Rebecca\",\n        1941: \"How Green Was My Valley\",\n        1942: \"Mrs. Miniver\",\n        1943: \"Casablanca\",\n        1944: \"Going My Way\",\n        1945: \"The Lost Weekend\",\n        1946: \"The Best Years of Our Lives\",\n        1947: \"Gentleman's Agreement\",\n        1948: \"Hamlet\",\n        1949: \"All the King's Men\",\n        1950: \"All About Eve\",\n        1951: \"An American in Paris\",\n        1952: \"The Greatest Show on Earth\",\n        1953: \"From Here to Eternity\",\n        1954: \"On the Waterfront\",\n        1955: \"Marty\",\n        1956: \"Around the World in 80 Days\",\n        1957: \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\",\n        1958: \"Gigi\",\n    }\n\n    # This set represents researched knowledge of which films show a Luxor Obelisk.\n    # \"An American in Paris\" is the first chronological winner with a confirmed depiction.\n    films_with_confirmed_obelisk = {\n        \"An American in Paris\", \n        \"Around the World in 80 Days\", \n        \"Gigi\"\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through the winners chronologically to find the first match.\n    sorted_years = sorted(best_picture_winners.keys())\n    \n    for year in sorted_years:\n        title = best_picture_winners[year]\n        if title in films_with_confirmed_obelisk:\n            print(f\"Based on film history, the first Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk was '{title}'.\")\n            print(f\"It won the award for the year {year}.\")\n            print(\"The film prominently features the obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\")\n            return\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_first_winner_with_obelisk()\n\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
