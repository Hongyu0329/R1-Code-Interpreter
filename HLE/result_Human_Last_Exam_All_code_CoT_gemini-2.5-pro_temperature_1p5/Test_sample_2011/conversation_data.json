    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will analyze the structure of the set of induced clique sizes in any given graph `G`. I will show that if a graph has an induced clique of size `k`, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes smaller than `k`.\n2.  This simplifies the problem to finding the maximum possible size of the largest induced clique (the clique number) in a graph with `n=128` vertices.\n3.  I will then determine this maximum possible clique number. This involves stating the upper bound and showing that this bound can be achieved by a specific graph construction.\n4.  Finally, based on this reasoning, I will write a Python script that calculates and prints the result for `n=128`.\n\nHere are the steps in detail:\n\nLet `G` be a graph with `n` vertices. An induced clique of size `k` is a set of `k` vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge in `G`.\n\n**Step 1: The structure of the set of induced clique sizes**\nLet `S(G)` be the set of all integers `k` for which `G` has an induced clique of size `k`. We want to maximize the size of this set, `|S(G)|`.\n\nLet `k_max` be the size of the largest induced clique in `G`. This is known as the clique number of `G`, denoted `omega(G)`. By definition, `k_max` is the largest value in the set `S(G)`.\n\nNow, consider an induced clique of size `k_max`. Let the set of its vertices be `C_max`, with `|C_max| = k_max`. Since this is an induced clique, the subgraph `G[C_max]` is a complete graph `K_{k_max}`.\n\nFor any integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= k_max`, we can choose a subset `C_k` of `C_max` with `|C_k| = k`. The subgraph induced by `C_k`, which is `G[C_k]`, is a subgraph of `G[C_max]`. Since all vertices in `C_max` are connected to each other, all vertices in its subset `C_k` must also be connected to each other. Thus, `G[C_k]` is a complete graph of size `k`, or `K_k`.\n\nThis shows that if a graph has an induced clique of size `k_max`, it must also have an induced clique of every size `k` from 1 to `k_max`. Therefore, the set of all induced clique sizes `S(G)` is always of the form `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`. The number of different clique sizes is `|S(G)| = k_max = omega(G)`.\n\n**Step 2: Maximizing the clique number**\nThe problem is now simplified to finding the maximum possible value of `omega(G)` for a graph `G` on `n` vertices.\n\nA clique is a set of vertices. The size of a clique cannot be greater than the total number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, for any graph `G` on `n` vertices, `omega(G) <= n`.\n\n**Step 3: Achieving the maximum**\nThe upper bound `n` for the clique number can be achieved. Consider the complete graph on `n` vertices, `K_n`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The set of all `n` vertices itself forms a clique. Therefore, for this graph, `omega(K_n) = n`.\n\nThis means the maximum possible clique number for a graph on `n` vertices is indeed `n`.\n\n**Step 4: Final conclusion and code**\nBased on the reasoning above, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is `n`. For `n=128`, the answer is 128.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to state this result. The \"equation\" mentioned in the prompt is trivial in this case: `maximum_number_of_sizes = n`. The script will print the resulting number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with n vertices.\n\n    The logic is as follows:\n    1.  The set of induced clique sizes in any graph G is {1, 2, ..., omega(G)},\n        where omega(G) is the size of the largest clique in G.\n    2.  Thus, the number of different clique sizes is omega(G).\n    3.  The problem is to find the maximum possible value of omega(G) for a graph\n        on n vertices.\n    4.  The clique size is limited by the number of vertices, so omega(G) <= n.\n    5.  The complete graph K_n has a clique of size n, so the maximum is n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of vertices in the graph is given.\n    n = 128\n\n    # The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is n.\n    max_sizes = n\n\n    # The final equation is simply max_sizes = n.\n    # The number we are interested in is the result.\n    print(max_sizes)\n\nsolve_max_clique_sizes()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
