    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. Let's break it down to construct the character.\n\n*   **\"A wooden stick\"**: This describes the Chinese radical for \"wood\" or \"tree\", which is **木** (mù).\n*   **\"hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center\"**: This part describes another character that sits on top of the \"wooden stick\". A \"square box\" is **口** (kǒu). A \"ladder placed in the center\" is like a cross, **十** (shí). When you put the cross (ladder) inside the box, you get the character for \"field\", which is **田** (tián).\n*   **Combination**: When you place the character **田** on top of the character **木**, you form the character **果** (guǒ).\n\nThe final character is **果**, which means \"fruit\".\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into components.\n    \"\"\"\n    part1_desc = \"A wooden stick\"\n    part1_char = \"木\"\n    part2_desc = \"a square box, a ladder placed in the center\"\n    part2_char = \"田\"\n    final_char = \"果\"\n\n    print(f\"The riddle describes the components of the character '{final_char}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"'{part1_desc}' refers to the radical for wood/tree: {part1_char}\")\n    print(f\"'{part2_desc}' refers to the character for field: {part2_char}\")\n    print(\"This is because '田' is composed of a square box (口) with a cross (十) inside, resembling a ladder.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"By placing the 'field' on top of the 'wooden stick', we form the final character.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation of Components:\")\n    print(f\"{part2_char} (field)\")\n    print(\"+\")\n    print(f\"{part1_char} (wood)\")\n    print(\"=\")\n    print(f\"{final_char} (fruit)\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<果>>>"
