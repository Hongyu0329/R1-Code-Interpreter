# --- Given Information ---
# The total experimental second osmotic virial coefficient (B22_total).
# This value represents the net effect of all interactions (repulsive and attractive).
B22_total = -7.585  # in mL/g

# --- Known Physical Properties & Principles ---
# The second osmotic virial coefficient (B22) can be expressed as the sum of a
# repulsive steric component (B22_HS) and an interaction component (B22_int).
# B22_total = B22_HS + B22_int

# The steric component (B22_HS) is an intrinsic property of the molecule's size and shape.
# For a monoclonal antibody (a globular protein), it can be approximated using its
# partial specific volume (v_bar).
# A typical v_bar for a monoclonal antibody is 0.73 mL/g.
partial_specific_volume = 0.73  # in mL/g

# The approximation formula is: B22_HS = 8 * v_bar
# This represents the contribution from the excluded volume of the molecules.

# --- Calculation ---
# 1. Calculate the steric-only component (B22_HS)
B22_HS = 8 * partial_specific_volume

# 2. Calculate the interaction component (B22_int) for completeness
B22_int = B22_total - B22_HS

# --- Output the Results ---
