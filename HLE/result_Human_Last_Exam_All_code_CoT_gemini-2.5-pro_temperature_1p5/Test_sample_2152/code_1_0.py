def calculate_cross_section_ratio():
    """
    Calculates the ratio of differential cross-sections for scattering
    by a magnetic monopole and a magnetic dipole.

    The problem asks for the ratio:
    R = (d(sigma)/d(Omega))_mono / (d(sigma)/d(Omega))_dip

    The derivation, using the first Born approximation and averaging over dipole
    orientations, leads to the following formula for the ratio:
    R = (m_e/m)^2 * (12/625) * (c/v)^2 * (1/alpha^2) * sin^2(pi*alpha/8)

    where:
    - m is the projectile mass, and m_e is the electron mass.
    - c/v is the ratio of the speed of light to the projectile's speed.
    - alpha is the fine-structure constant.
    - The numbers 12 and 625 come from constants in the problem and derivation
      (e.g., mu = 25*mu_B -> 25^2 = 625).

    We assume the projectile is an electron (m=m_e), a common simplification for
    such problems where the projectile mass isn't specified and electron-related
    constants like the Bohr magneton (mu_B) are used.

    For a small argument x, sin(x) approx x. The argument here is pi*alpha/8,
    which is very small since alpha ~ 1/137. So, sin^2(pi*alpha/8) approx (pi*alpha/8)^2.

    The ratio simplifies to:
    R_approx = (12/625) * (c/v)^2 * (1/alpha^2) * (pi*alpha/8)^2
             = (12 * pi^2) / (625 * 64) * (c/v)^2
             = (3 * pi^2) / (625 * 16) * (c/v)^2
             = (3 * pi^2 / 10000) * (c/v)^2

    Given v = c/100, (c/v)^2 = 100^2 = 10000.
    The final simplified result is R = 3 * pi^2.
