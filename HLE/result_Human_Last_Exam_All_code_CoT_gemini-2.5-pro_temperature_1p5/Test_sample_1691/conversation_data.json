    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$. For small positive $\\epsilon$, the denominator becomes very small when the term $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$ is close to zero. This happens at $x=0$. This means the main contribution to the integral comes from a small region around $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the Integrand**: In this small region near $x=0$, the lowest power of $x$ in $f(x)$ will dominate. So, we can approximate $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$. This simplifies the denominator to $\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the Integral**: We can now approximate the integral as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$. Since the value of this approximate integrand decreases rapidly as $x$ increases (like $1/x^5$), the error from extending the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ is negligible. This makes the integral solvable in a standard form: $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n4.  **Solve the Approximate Integral**: This integral can be solved analytically.\n    *   First, we use the substitution $u = 9.0 x^5$. This gives $x = (u/9)^{1/5}$ and $dx = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5} \\cdot 5} u^{-4/5} du$.\n    *   The integral transforms into a form involving $\\epsilon$ and a standard integral: $\\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{\\epsilon + u} du$.\n    *   By substituting $u = \\epsilon t$, we can separate the $\\epsilon$ dependency: $\\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{-4/5}}{1+t} dt$.\n    *   The remaining integral is a well-known result related to the Gamma and Beta functions: $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{z-1}}{1+t} dt = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$. For $z = 1/5$, this is $\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final Formula**: By combining all the constants and the $\\epsilon$ dependency, we get the final asymptotic formula for $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime. The result will be of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{-p}$.\n\n6.  **Provide Python Code**: I will provide a Python script that calculates the numerical values of the constant $C$ and the exponent $p$ and prints out the final analytical formula with all the relevant numbers.\n\nNow, here is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script develops and presents an analytical approximation for the integral\n    I(eps) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1/(eps + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8) dx\n    for the small epsilon regime.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Constants from the problem's integrand ---\n    # The term f(x) in the denominator is 9.0*x^5.0 + 5.0*x^6.0 + 9.0*x^8.0\n    # For small x, the leading term is a*x^p\n    p0 = 5.0\n    a0 = 9.0\n\n    # --- Derivation of the exponent p ---\n    # The exponent in the approximation I(eps) ~ eps^(-p) is given by\n    # p = (p0 - 1) / p0\n    p_num = p0 - 1.0\n    p_den = p0\n    p = p_num / p_den\n\n    # --- Derivation of the constant C ---\n    # The coefficient C is given by the formula: C = pi / (p0 * a0^(1/p0) * sin(pi/p0))\n    try:\n        c_val = math.pi / (p0 * (a0**(1.0/p0)) * math.sin(math.pi/p0))\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error calculating C: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # --- Presenting the final formula ---\n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates the integral I(epsilon) for small epsilon is developed as follows:\")\n    print(\"1.
