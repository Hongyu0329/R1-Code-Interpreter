    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. At steady state, as time $t$ approaches infinity ($t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. This means their derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, become zero.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Set up the system of linear equations:** By setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ in the given Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, we transform the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n2.  **Incorporate the normalization condition:** The sum of all probabilities must equal 1, i.e., $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$. This equation is necessary to find a unique solution.\n3.  **Solve the linear system:** We will construct the system in matrix form, $A \\cdot \\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{P}$ is the vector of unknown probabilities $[P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3]^T$. We will use Python with the NumPy library to solve this system efficiently and accurately.\n4.  **Calculate the final sum:** Once we have the values for $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$, we will compute the required sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# Step 2: Set up the system of linear equations for the steady state (P_i' = 0)\n# From P0'(t) = 0:  -lambda_01*P0 + lambda_10*P1 = 0\n# From P2'(t) = 0:  lambda_12*P1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*P2 = 0\n# From P3'(t) = 0:  lambda_23*P2 - lambda_31*P3 = 0\n# Normalization:    P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\n# We can express this system in the matrix form A*P = b\n\n# Step 3: Construct the matrix A and vector b\n# P = [P0, P1, P2, P3]^T\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system for the probability vector P\ntry:\n    P_inf = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    P0_inf = P_inf[0]\n    P1_inf = P_inf[1]\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the required sum\n    result = P0_inf + P1_inf\n\n    # Print the individual probabilities and the final equation\n    print(f\"Calculated steady-state probabilities:\")\n    print(f\"P0(+inf) = {P0_inf}\")\n    print(f\"P1(+inf) = {P1_inf}\")\n    print(f\"P2(+inf) = {P_inf[2]}\")\n    print(f\"P3(+inf) = {P_inf[3]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = {P0_inf} + {P1_inf}\")\n    print(f\"Result = {result}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations is singular and cannot be solved.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339462>>>"
