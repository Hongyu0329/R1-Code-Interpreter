    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Edge Squares:** First, I'll determine the total number of squares on the perimeter of a standard 8x8 chessboard. The formula is `(side_length * 4) - 4` to account for the four corner squares that are counted twice.\n2.  **Determine Maximum Bishops:** The core of the problem is to find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares without any bishop attacking another. Bishops attack along diagonals of the same color.\n    *   I will analyze the white edge squares and black edge squares separately, as bishops on different colors can never attack each other.\n    *   An 8x8 board has 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n    *   On the white edge squares, squares on the same diagonal form pairs (e.g., `h1` and `a8`). There are 7 such pairs. Since you can only place one bishop per pair, a maximum of 7 bishops can be placed on the white edge squares.\n    *   By symmetry, the same logic applies to the 14 black edge squares, allowing for a maximum of 7 bishops.\n    *   The total number of bishops is the sum from both colors (7 + 7).\n3.  **Calculate Empty Squares:** Finally, I'll subtract the maximum number of bishops from the total number of edge squares to find how many are left empty.\n4.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard after placing\n    the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on them.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares on an N x N board.\n    # Formula: 4 * (N - 1)\n    total_edge_squares = 4 * (board_size - 1)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    # An 8x8 board has 28 edge squares (14 white, 14 black).\n    # Bishops on squares of different colors never attack each other.\n    # For each color, the 14 edge squares form 7 pairs of squares that\n    # lie on the same diagonal. From each pair, only one bishop can be placed.\n    # Therefore, we can place 7 bishops on white squares and 7 on black squares.\n    max_bishops_on_white_edges = 7\n    max_bishops_on_black_edges = 7\n    total_placed_bishops = max_bishops_on_white_edges + max_bishops_on_black_edges\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate how many edge squares are empty.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - total_placed_bishops\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.\n    print(f\"A standard {board_size}x{board_size} chessboard has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on these squares is {total_placed_bishops}.\")\n    print(\"The number of empty edge squares is the difference between these two numbers.\")\n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {total_placed_bishops} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
