    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the corresponding Python code to find the equilibrium values for the energy and entropy of a photon gas.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Fundamental Principle**: The equilibrium state of an isolated system, like a collection of photons (light quanta) at a fixed total energy, is the one with the maximum number of accessible microstates. This is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy, `S = k_B * log(Ω)`, where `Ω` is the number of microstates and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant. This principle is rigorously grounded in large deviation theory (like Sanov's theorem), which shows that deviations from this most probable state are exponentially unlikely.\n\n2.  **System Definition**: We consider a gas of photons in a volume `V`. Photons are bosons, so any number of them can occupy the same energy state. The total number of photons is not conserved. The only constraint on the system is the total energy, `E = Σ_j n_j * ε_j`, where `n_j` is the number of photons in the energy level `ε_j`.\n\n3.  **Entropy Maximization**: We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize the entropy `S` subject to the energy constraint. This procedure yields the famous Planck distribution for the average occupation number `⟨n_j⟩` of an energy state `ε_j` (with degeneracy `g_j`):\n    `⟨n_j⟩ = g_j / (exp(ε_j / (k_B * T)) - 1)`\n    Here, `T` is the temperature, which arises from the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint.\n\n4.  **From Discrete States to Continuous Energy**: For a macroscopic volume, the energy levels are so closely spaced that we can replace the sum over states `Σ_j` with an integral over energy `∫ dε`. This requires the density of states function, `g(ε)`, which tells us how many states exist per unit energy interval. For photons in a 3D box, this is:\n    `g(ε) = (V / (π² * ħ³ * c³)) * ε²`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Calculating Equilibrium Energy and Entropy**:\n    *   The **Mean Energy (E)** is found by integrating the energy of each state multiplied by its occupation number:\n        `E = ∫[0 to ∞] ε * g(ε) / (exp(ε / (k_B * T)) - 1) dε`\n    *   The **Entropy (S)** can be derived from the thermodynamic relation `S = E/T + k_B * log(Z)`, where `Z` is the partition function. This leads to the integral form:\n        `S = E/T - k_B * ∫[0 to ∞] g(ε) * log(1 - exp(-ε / (k_B * T))) dε`\n\n6.  **Implementation**: The Python code below will numerically compute these integrals for a given temperature `T` and volume `V` to find the equilibrium values of `E` and `S`. It will then print the final results and the components of the entropy equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import constants, integrate\n\ndef solve_photon_gas_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium mean energy and entropy of a photon gas\n    in a given volume and at a given temperature.\n    \n    The calculation is based on the principles of statistical mechanics for a\n    Bose gas (photons) and uses numerical integration over the density of states.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define System Parameters ---\n    T = 500.0  # Temperature in Kelvin (e.g., surface of a hot plate)\n    V = 1.0    # Volume in cubic meters\n\n    print(f\"--- System Parameters ---\")\n    print(f\"Temperature (T): {T} K\")\n    print(f\"Volume (V):      {V} m^3\\n\")\n\n    # --- Physical Constants ---\n    k_B = constants.k      # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\n    hbar = constants.hbar  # Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\n    c = constants.c        # Speed of light (m/s)\n\n    # Lagrange multiplier beta\n    beta = 1.0 / (k_B * T)\n\n    # --- Density of States Function ---\n    # g(epsilon) = (V / (pi^2 * hbar^3 * c^3)) * epsilon^2\n    # We define the constant factor first for efficiency.\n    g_factor = V / (np.pi**2 * hbar**3 * c**3)\n\n    # --- Integrands for Energy and Entropy Calculation ---\n    \n    # Integrand for mean energy E\n    # integrand_E = epsilon * g(epsilon) / (exp(beta*epsilon) - 1)\n    def integrand_E(epsilon):\n        # Use np.expm1 for better numerical stability for small arguments\n        return (g_factor * epsilon**3) / np.expm1(beta * epsilon)\n\n    # Integrand for the log(Z) term in the entropy calculation\n    # log(Z) = -Integral[g(epsilon) * log(1 - exp(-beta*epsilon))] d_epsilon\n    # So we integrate g(epsilon) * log(1 - exp(-beta*epsilon))\n    def integrand_logZ_term(epsilon):\n        # Use np.log1p for better numerical stability\n        return g_factor * epsilon**2 * np.log1p(-np.exp(-beta * epsilon))\n\n    # --- Numerical Integration ---\n    # We integrate from 0 to infinity\n    E, E_err = integrate.quad(integrand_E, 0, np.inf)\n    \n    # Note: log(Z) is negative.
