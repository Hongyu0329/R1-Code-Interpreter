# The reasoning above establishes the complexities for both parts of the question.
# This Python code block will print the final answer in the requested format.
# Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!

# For Question A, the complexity is constant time, O(1).
# The number here is 1.
complexity_A_constant = 1

# For Question B, the complexity is cubic time, O(n^3).
# The number in the exponent is 3.
complexity_B_exponent = 3

# Printing the final answer string, incorporating the numbers.
print(f"O({complexity_A_constant}); O(n^{complexity_B_exponent})")
