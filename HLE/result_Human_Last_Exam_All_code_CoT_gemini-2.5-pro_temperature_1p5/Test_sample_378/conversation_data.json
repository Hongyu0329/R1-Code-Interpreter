    "Based on my research, the user's question is based on a common misconception. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full and official name does not include \"Azikiwe\". There are no credible public records, speeches, or official documents where he has identified himself by that name. The name is sometimes incorrectly attributed to him.\n\nTherefore, the event the user is asking about—Goodluck Jonathan publicly identifying as Azikiwe—never happened. A script cannot find a year for an event that did not occur. The following Python code will print a clear explanation of this fact.\n\n```python\ndef explain_name_facts():\n  \"\"\"\n  Addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan and the name 'Azikiwe'.\n  \"\"\"\n  fact1 = \"Based on all available public records, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's official name does not include 'Azikiwe'.\"\n  fact2 = \"There is no record of him ever publicly identifying with or adopting the name 'Azikiwe'.\"\n  conclusion = \"Therefore, the event you are asking about did not happen, and there is no year to provide.\"\n\n  print(fact1)\n  print(fact2)\n  print(conclusion)\n\n# Run the function to provide the explanation.\nexplain_name_facts()\n```\n<<<The event described did not happen as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name does not include 'Azikiwe'.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
