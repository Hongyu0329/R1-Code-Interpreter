    "This is a problem in point-set topology, specifically continuum theory. Let's break it down.\n\n### My plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Define the key terms:** I need to be clear on what a \"nondegenerate continuum\" and a \"composant\" are.\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space. \"Nondegenerate\" means it contains more than one point.\n    *   For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the **composant** of `p` is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. The set of composants partitions the entire space `X`.\n\n2.  **Relate the composants of the product to the composants of the factors:** I will use a fundamental theorem from continuum theory that describes the composants of a product space. The theorem states that if `X` and `Y` are continua, the composants of the product space `X x Y` are precisely the Cartesian products of the a composant of `X` and a composant of `Y`.\n    *   This means: `Number of composants of (X x Y) = (Number of composants of X) * (Number of composants of Y)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the maximum number of composants for a single continuum:** To maximize the product, I need to find the maximum possible number of composants a single nondegenerate continuum can have.\n    *   Locally connected continua (like a line segment or a circle) have only 1 composant.\n    *   However, so-called *indecomposable continua* can have many more. The maximum possible number of composants a continuum can have is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum (the \"number\" of real numbers, `2^ℵ₀`). Examples of continua with **c** composants include the Knaster continuum (or \"buckethandle continuum\").\n\n4.  **Calculate the final result:** Using the rule from step 2 and the maximum from step 3, I will choose two continua, `X` and `Y`, that each have **c** composants. The number of composants in their product `X x Y` will be `c * c`.\n\n5.  **Use cardinal arithmetic:** The product `c * c` is a multiplication of infinite cardinal numbers. In cardinal arithmetic, `c * c = c`.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants is **c**. I will write a Python script to formalize and present this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composant_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the topological problem about the number of composants\n    in a product of two continua.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The maximum number of composants for a single nondegenerate continuum is\n    # 'c', the cardinality of the continuum.
