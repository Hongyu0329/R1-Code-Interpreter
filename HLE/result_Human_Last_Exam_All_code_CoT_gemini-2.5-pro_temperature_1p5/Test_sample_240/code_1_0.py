That's an excellent observation, and it points to a key difference between a simple resonant circuit and a modern MRI receive coil. The reason a perfectly functional coil might not show resonance on your VNA is usually due to active electronic circuits designed to protect the coil and ensure its proper function *within the MRI scanner environment*.

Here are the most common reasons:

1.  **Active Transmit/Receive (T/R) Detuning Circuits:** This is the most likely cause. During an MRI scan, a very powerful radiofrequency (RF) pulse is transmitted to excite the patient's protons. The receive coil, being extremely sensitive, must be 'detuned' during this transmit phase. If it weren't, it would absorb a massive amount of energy, which could damage the coil's sensitive preamplifier and even potentially create unsafe RF heating in the patient.
    *   **Mechanism:** This detuning is typically accomplished using PIN diodes. When the scanner is about to transmit, it sends a DC bias voltage to the coil, which turns the PIN diodes 'on'. These diodes then either short-circuit the coil's capacitor or add resistance, which completely spoils or shifts the resonance.
    *   **On the Bench:** When you test the coil on the bench with your VNA, it is not connected to the scanner. In many coil designs, the default, unpowered state for these T/R switching circuits is the 'detuned' or 'safe' state. Without the specific 'receive mode' control signal from the scanner, the PIN diodes remain in their detuning configuration, and therefore, you will see no resonance.

2.  **Integrated Preamplifiers:** Modern coils have low-noise preamplifiers (LNAs) integrated directly into the coil housing, very close to the resonant element.
    *   **Impedance Loading:** The coil is not designed to be resonant in open air; it is designed to be resonant and impedance-matched to the input of this preamplifier. When the coil is unpowered on the bench, the preamplifier is off. The input impedance of an unpowered LNA is not what the coil is designed to see. This 'wrong' impedance load can dramatically lower the coil's quality factor (Q) or shift its resonance, making the resonance peak very broad, shallow, or non-existent.

3.  **Coil Geometry and Shielding:**
    *   **Specialized Designs:** Some coils are not simple loops. For example, 'gradiometer' coils are designed to reject uniform magnetic fields and are only sensitive to field gradients. Your small sniffer loop might be creating a relatively uniform field that the coil is designed to ignore.
    *   **RF Shielding:** The coil might be enclosed in a housing with an RF shield to prevent it from picking up external noise. This shield can also prevent the field from your sniffer coil from effectively coupling to the internal resonant elements.

In summary, a 'functional' MRI coil is an active, complex system that often requires power and control signals from the scanner to enter its sensitive 'receive' state. Your VNA and sniffer coil are testing the coil in its passive, default, and often deliberately non-resonant 'safe' state.
