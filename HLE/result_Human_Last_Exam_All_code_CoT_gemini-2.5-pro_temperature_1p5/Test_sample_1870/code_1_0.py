# Step 1: Understanding the Problem
# The problem asks for the minimal length δ of a tower ⟨x_α : α < δ⟩ with the following properties:
# 1. Each x_α is an uncountable subset of ω₁ (the first uncountable ordinal).
# 2. For any α < β < δ, the set difference |x_β \setminus x_α| is countable (less than ω₁). This means x_β is an "almost-subset" of x_α, which we can write as x_β ⊆* x_α. The tower is a ⊆*-descending chain.
# 3. The tower is maximal: there is no uncountable set y ⊆ ω₁ such that y ⊆* x_α for all α < δ.

# Step 2: Proving the minimal length δ must be greater than ω₁
# We will prove this by contradiction. Assume that a maximal tower of length δ = ω₁ exists.
# Let this tower be ⟨x_α : α < ω₁⟩.
# We will show that this tower cannot be maximal by constructing an uncountable set 'y' such that y ⊆* x_α for all α < ω₁.

# Step 2a: Simplify the tower
# For any α < ω₁, let x'_α = ∩_{β≤α} x_β. Since this is a countable intersection of uncountable sets where each differs from the next by a countable set, each x'_α is still uncountable and x'_α ⊇ x'_γ for α < γ. It is equivalent to work with this cleaned-up, truly descending tower. For simplicity, let's just assume our x_α sequence is already descending (x_α ⊇ x_β for α < β).

# Step 2b: Use Club Sets
# A "club" set in ω₁ is a set that is Closed and Unbounded. All club sets are uncountable.
# A key fact is that any uncountable subset of ω₁ contains a club set.
# So, for each α < ω₁, we can choose a club set C_α such that C_α ⊆ x_α.

# Step 2c: Construct the Diagonal Intersection
# We define a new set 'y' using the diagonal intersection of these club sets:
# y = {β ∈ ω₁ : for all α < β, β ∈ C_α}

# Step 2d: Show 'y' is a valid pseudo-intersection
# A major theorem in set theory states that the diagonal intersection of ω₁ club sets in ω₁ is itself a club set. Therefore, 'y' is uncountable.
# Now, we must show that y ⊆* x_α for every α < ω₁. Let's fix an arbitrary α.
# Consider any element β ∈ y such that β > α.
# By the definition of 'y', since β is in 'y' and β > α, it must be that β ∈ C_α.
# Since we chose C_α to be a subset of x_α, it follows that β ∈ x_α.
# This means that any element in 'y' larger than α is also in 'x_α'.
# Therefore, the set difference y \ x_α can only contain elements β ≤ α. The set of ordinals up to α is a countable set.
# So, for every α < ω₁, |y \ x_α| is countable.

# Step 3: Reaching a Contradiction
# We have constructed an uncountable set 'y' that is an "almost-subset" of every x_α in the tower.
# This contradicts the maximality condition (property #3).
# Our initial assumption that a maximal tower of length ω₁ exists must be false.
# Thus, the minimal length δ must be strictly greater than ω₁.

# Step 4: Final Answer
# The smallest ordinal number greater than ω₁ is ω₂.
# It is a theorem of ZFC set theory that a maximal tower of this type of length ω₂ can indeed be constructed.
# Therefore, the minimal possible value for δ is ω₂.
