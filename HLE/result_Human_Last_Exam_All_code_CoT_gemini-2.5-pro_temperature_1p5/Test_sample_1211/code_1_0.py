    print("Statement II: Subutex (buprenorphine alone) is often considered safer for specific patient populations, like pregnant women or those with a known naloxone sensitivity, because it eliminates any risk associated with the naloxone component.")
    print("Statement III: When taken sublingually as prescribed, Suboxone and Subutex have similar safety profiles. This is because buprenorphine is the main active ingredient, and the naloxone in Suboxone has poor bioavailability when taken this way.")
    print("Statement V: The relative safety depends on the route of administration. Suboxone is designed to be safer by deterring intravenous misuse (due to the naloxone), while both are similarly safe when used correctly.")
