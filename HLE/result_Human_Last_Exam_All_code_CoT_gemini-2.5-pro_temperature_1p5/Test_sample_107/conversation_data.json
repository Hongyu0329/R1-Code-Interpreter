    "My plan is to find the smallest single network block (supernet) that can encompass both of the provided networks. This will represent the most efficient single Access Control List (ACL) entry.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Parse the input networks**: I'll take the two network strings, `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\n2.  **Determine the full range**: I'll calculate the first IP address of the first network and the last IP address (broadcast address) of the second network. This defines the total address space that needs to be covered.\n3.  **Find the common prefix**: By comparing the binary representations of the starting and ending IP addresses of the total range, I'll find the longest string of matching bits from the left. The length of this common prefix determines the subnet mask of our summary route.\n4.  **Calculate the supernet**: Using the common prefix length, I'll determine the network address and wildcard mask for the supernet. The network address is found by taking the starting IP and setting all bits after the common prefix to zero. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask derived from the prefix length.\n5.  **Format the output**: I'll present the final result as a network address followed by a wildcard mask, which is the standard format for an ACL entry.\n\nI will use Python's `ipaddress` library to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef solve_acl_summary():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest appropriate ACL entry (supernet) to cover two given networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
