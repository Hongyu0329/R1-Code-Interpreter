    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe poem *Sir Launfal*, a Middle English romance by Thomas Chestre, is preserved in a single famous manuscript. My plan is to identify that manuscript and then examine its other contents to find the text that can be described as a \"book of manners\". The Python code below will store the names of the relevant works and print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_accompanying_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the book of manners\n    that was preserved in the same manuscript as the poem 'Sir Launfal'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The romance 'Sir Launfal' by Thomas Chestre is found in the\n    # British Library manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii.\n    sir_launfal = \"Sir Launfal\"\n\n    # This manuscript is a collection of various Middle English texts,\n    # including a famous book on etiquette and manners for young people.\n    book_of_manners = \"The Babees Book\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a complete sentence.\n    print(f\"The poem '{sir_launfal}' was preserved alongside the book of manners known as '{book_of_manners}'.\")\n\nfind_accompanying_book()\n```\n<<<The Babees Book>>>"
