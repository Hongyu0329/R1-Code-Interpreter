print("This is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:")
print("\nStep 1: Identify the set of possible cofinalities, X.")
print("The problem asks for the order type of the set X of possible cofinalities for the cardinality of the continuum (2^omega).")
print("Let lambda = cf(2^omega). Based on the given information and axioms of set theory:")
print(" - lambda is a regular cardinal.")
print(" - By Konig's Theorem, lambda must be an uncountable cardinal (lambda > aleph_0).")
print(" - From the problem statement, lambda < 2^omega < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.")
print("Set theory results (specifically, from forcing) show that any cardinal lambda satisfying these conditions is a possible value for cf(2^omega).")
print("Thus, X is the set of all regular uncountable cardinals less than aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.")

print("\nStep 2: Relate the order type of X to the order type of its indices.")
print("The order type of X is determined by the order type of the set of indices of these cardinals. Let's call this set I.")
print("I = {alpha | 1 <= alpha < omega_{omega+5} and aleph_alpha is a regular cardinal}.")
print("An infinite cardinal aleph_alpha is regular if alpha is a successor ordinal or a regular limit ordinal.")

print("\nStep 3: Calculate the order type of I.")
print("Let gamma = omega_{omega+5}. We need to find the order type of the set of successor ordinals and regular limit ordinals less than gamma.")
print("A proof by transfinite induction demonstrates that for any initial ordinal of the form delta = omega_beta, the order type of the set of regular cardinal indices less than delta is, in fact, delta.")
print("This holds because the 'gaps' left by removing singular limit ordinals are not large enough to reduce the overall order type of the set.")

print("\nStep 4: Final Conclusion.")
print("Applying this result to our specific case, the order type of the set of regular cardinals below aleph_{omega_{omega+5}} is omega_{omega+5}.")
