    "To solve the competitive programming problem, we first need to devise a C program that is as memory-efficient as possible. Then, we will calculate the total memory in bytes used by the variables in that program.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Core**: The task is to compare two strings lexicographically while ignoring the case of the letters.\n2.  **Input Structure**: The two strings are provided on separate lines. This is a critical detail because it means we must read and store the first string entirely before we can access the second string. This makes it impossible to compare the strings character-by-character \"on the fly\" without storing at least one of them in a buffer. The most straightforward approach is to store both.\n3.  **Memory-Efficient C Program Design**:\n    *   **Variables**:\n        *   We need two character arrays (buffers) to store the input strings. The maximum length is 100 characters. In C, a string requires an extra byte for the null terminator (`\\0`). Therefore, we need `char s1[101];` and `char s2[101];`.\n        *   We need a loop counter to iterate through the strings. An `int i;` is suitable for this.\n    *   **Logic**:\n        1.  Read the two strings into `s1` and `s2` using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` or a similar function.\n        2.  Iterate from `i = 0` as long as `s1[i]` is not the null terminator.\n        3.  In each iteration, convert `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` to lowercase using the `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>`.\n        4.  Compare the lowercase characters.\n        5.  If they differ, print \"-1\" or \"1\" accordingly and terminate the program.\n        6.  If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal, so print \"0\".\n4.  **Memory Calculation (m)**:\n    The total memory `m` is the sum of the sizes of the variables declared. We will assume a standard 32-bit or 64-bit system where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, which is common in competitive programming environments.\n    *   Memory for `s1` (`char[101]`): 101 * 1 byte = 101 bytes.\n    *   Memory for `s2` (`char[101]`): 101 * 1 byte = 101 bytes.\n    *   Memory for `i` (`int`): 4 bytes.\n    *   **Total (m)** = 101 + 101 + 4 = 206 bytes.\n\nThe following Python script will explain this reasoning and calculate the final answer `m`.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the memory usage of an efficient C program for the described problem\n    and prints the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This is a step-by-step analysis to find the memory usage 'm' for the most memory-efficient C program.\")\n    print(\"\\n1. C Program Variable Requirements:\")\n    print(\"   - The problem requires reading two strings from separate lines. This necessitates storing them in memory buffers.\")\n    print(\"   - The maximum string length is 100. In C, a null terminator ('\\\\0') is needed, so the buffer size must be 101.\")\n    print(\"   - Thus, we need 'char s1[101];' and 'char s2[101];'.\")\n    print(\"   - A loop counter, 'int i;', is also needed for iteration.\")\n\n    # Define the size in bytes for each variable type on a typical system.\n    char_size = 1\n    int_size = 4\n\n    # Calculate memory for each variable.\n    s1_memory = 101 * char_size\n    s2_memory = 101 * char_size\n    i_memory = int_size\n\n    total_memory = s1_memory + s2_memory + i_memory\n\n    print(\"\\n2. Memory Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"   - Memory for 'char s1[101]': 101 * {char_size} byte/char = {s1_memory} bytes.\")\n    print(f\"   - Memory for 'char s2[101]': 101 * {char_size} byte/char = {s2_memory} bytes.\")\n    print(f\"   - Memory for 'int i': {i_memory} bytes.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n3. Final Equation for Total Memory (m):\")\n    # Output the final equation with each number explicitly mentioned.\n    print(f\"   m = (memory for s1) + (memory for s2) + (memory for i)\")\n    print(f\"   m = {s1_memory} + {s2_memory} + {i_memory}\")\n    print(f\"   m = {total_memory} bytes\")\n\n    # The final answer in the required format.\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{total_memory}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
