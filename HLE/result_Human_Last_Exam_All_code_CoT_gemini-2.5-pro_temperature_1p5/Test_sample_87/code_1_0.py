# Given values from the problem statement
I_XY = 3
I_XZ_given_Y = 5

# Step 1: Find the maximum possible value for I(X;W|Y).
# W is a function of Z. Due to the Data Processing Inequality, I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y).
max_I_XW_given_Y = I_XZ_given_Y

# Step 2: Find the minimum possible value for I(X;W).
# Mutual information is always non-negative, so its minimum is 0.
min_I_XW = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the maximum value of the difference term in the identity
# I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W).
# The maximum difference is max(I(X;W|Y)) - min(I(X;W)).
max_difference = max_I_XW_given_Y - min_I_XW

# Step 4: Calculate the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W).
largest_I_XY_given_W = I_XY + max_difference

# Print the final equation with all the numbers
print(f"The largest possible value is found using the identity I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + (I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)).")
print(f"We maximize the term (I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)) by choosing an optimal W=f(Z).")
print(f"max(I(X;W|Y)) is bounded by I(X;Z|Y), which is {I_XZ_given_Y}.")
print(f"min(I(X;W)) is {min_I_XW}.")
print(f"So, the maximum difference is {max_I_XW_given_Y} - {min_I_XW} = {max_difference}.")
