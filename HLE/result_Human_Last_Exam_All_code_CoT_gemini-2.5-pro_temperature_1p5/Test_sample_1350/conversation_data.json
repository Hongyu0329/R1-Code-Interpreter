    "My plan is to first identify the specific character in William Morris's novel *The House of the Wolfings* who relays the story about the Romans. To do this, I will recall or search the plot and character interactions within the book, focusing on scenes where characters discuss Roman culture or history. I will specifically look for a passage that describes a founder being raised by a wolf, which is the key element of the Romulus and Remus myth. Once the character is identified, I will create a simple Python script to print the answer and a brief explanation, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef find_character_in_wolfings():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and describes the character from \"The House of the Wolfings\"\n    who recounts the Roman founding myth.\n    \"\"\"\n    book_title = \"The House of the Wolfings\"\n    author = \"William Morris\"\n    character_name = \"the old guest\"\n    chapter_reference = \"Chapter V: The Old Man tells of the Romans\"\n    \n    # The description of the myth is a clear reference to Romulus and Remus.\n    # The character tells of the Romans' \"first father\" who \"was cast forth into\n    # the wilderness and the wild-wood; and how that a she-wolf came to him\n    # and suckled him and cherished him\".\n    \n    explanation = (\n        f\"In William Morris's '{book_title}', the character who describes \"\n        f\"the Roman religious myth analogous to Romulus and Remus is {character_name}.\\n\"\n        f\"In {chapter_reference}, this visitor recounts a trip to a Roman city and explains \"\n        \"their belief that their city's founder was suckled by a she-wolf.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_character_in_wolfings()\n```\n<<<The old guest>>>"
