    print("\n[Step 1] Interpretation of the premises:")
    print("  - Premise 1 ('no cycles with non-zero sum') implies that the edge signal x^1 is a gradient flow.")
    print("    In matrix terms, this means x^1 is in the image of the gradient operator B1^T, so x^1 ∈ Im(B1^T).")
    print("  - Premise 2 ('B1 * x^1 * 1^T = 0') implies that the divergence of x^1 is zero.")
    print("    In matrix terms, this means x^1 is in the kernel of the divergence operator B1, so x^1 ∈ Ker(B1).")

    print("\n[Step 2] Combining the implications:")
    print("  - The subspaces Im(B1^T) (gradient flows) and Ker(B1) (divergence-free flows/cycles) are orthogonal complements.")
    print("  - The only vector that can be in two orthogonal subspaces is the zero vector.")
    print("  - Therefore, we must conclude that the edge signal x^1 is the zero vector: x^1 = 0.")

    print("\n[Step 3] Relating to the vertex signal x^0 and Total Variation:")
    print("  - Premise 3 states that for each edge e={u,v}, x^1_e = |x^0_u - x^0_v|.")
    print("  - Since x^1 = 0, it follows that |x^0_u - x^0_v| = 0 for every edge.")
    print("  - The Total Variation (TV) of the vertex signal x^0 is defined as the sum of these absolute differences over all edges.")
