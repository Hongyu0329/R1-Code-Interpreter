    print("---------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("An 'accident scenario' implies several challenges:")
    print("  - Time Evolution: The simulation must be transient (time-dependent).")
    print("  - Complex Geometry: Accidents can involve distorted or melted core components, requiring high geometric fidelity.")
    print("  - Coupled Physics: The simulation must account for the feedback between neutronics (power), thermal-hydraulics (heat removal), and fuel behavior.")

    # Evaluate 3D Diffusion
    print("\n[E] 3D Diffusion:")
    print("  - Pro: Computationally fast.")
    print("  - Con: It's an approximation of transport theory and is inaccurate in regions with high absorption, leakage, or material heterogeneity (e.g., near control rods, fuel-coolant boundaries, or in a damaged core).")
    print("  - Verdict: Generally unsuitable for high-fidelity accident analysis.")
    
    # Evaluate Deterministic Transport (Pn, Sn)
    print("\n[A] Pn Transport & [B] Discrete Ordinates (Sn):")
    print("  - Pro: More accurate than diffusion theory.")
    print("  - Con: These methods require a spatial mesh. Meshing the complex and evolving geometries of a severe accident scenario is extremely difficult and computationally intensive.")
    print("  - Verdict: Capable, but less flexible and potentially less accurate than Monte Carlo for severely distorted geometries.")
    
    # Evaluate Monte Carlo methods
    print("\n[C] & [D] Monte Carlo Methods (Serpent, MCNP):")
    print("  - Pro: Can handle arbitrary and complex 3D geometries with no geometric approximation. This is a critical advantage for modeling damaged reactor cores.")
    print("  - Pro: Uses continuous-energy nuclear data, providing the highest fidelity physics simulation.")
    print("  - Pro: Modern codes can be coupled with thermal-hydraulics solvers for transient analysis.")
    print("  - Verdict: This methodology is the 'gold standard' for complex problems and is best suited for this task.")

    print("  - [D] MCNP with ENDF/B-VIII.1 Data")
    print("Both Serpent and MCNP are state-of-the-art Monte Carlo codes. However, ENDF/B-VIII.1 is the successor to ENDF/B-VII.1, representing a more recent, re-evaluated, and improved data set.")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion")
    print("----------")
    print("The Monte Carlo method is the most suitable due to its unparalleled geometric flexibility. Between the two Monte Carlo options, the one using the more modern ENDF/B-VIII.1 nuclear data library represents the most current and highest-fidelity approach.")
