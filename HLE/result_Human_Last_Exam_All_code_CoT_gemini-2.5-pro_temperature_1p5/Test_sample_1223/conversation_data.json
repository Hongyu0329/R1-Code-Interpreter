    "This is a problem in advanced topology, specifically in continuum theory. The solution does not involve a numerical calculation but rather the application of established theorems. Here is my plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the object of study:** The question asks about the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum. Let's call this remainder $R$. So, $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n2.  **Recall a key theorem:** A fundamental theorem in continuum theory, largely due to the work of R.H. Bing and others, describes the structure of such remainders. The theorem states that if $K$ is a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continuum, then for any point $x \\in K$, the Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta(K \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is itself a hereditary indecomposable continuum.\n\n3.  **Analyze the properties of the remainder:** Since $X$ is a continuum (compact and connected), $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is locally compact but not compact. Therefore, its Stone-Cech remainder $R$ is non-empty. As a continuum, it cannot be a finite set of more than one point, so it must be an uncountable set. This means $R$ is a *non-degenerate* hereditary indecomposable continuum.\n\n4.  **Recall the theorem on the number of composants:** Another fundamental theorem states that any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is the union of its composants. The number of these pairwise disjoint, dense subsets is always $c$, the cardinality of the continuum ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n5.  **Synthesize and conclude:** Since the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate (hereditary) indecomposable continuum, it must have exactly $c$ composants. This value is fixed by the topological nature of the remainder. Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is $c$.\n\n6.  **Create the Python script:** The script will not compute a value but will use `print` statements to present this line of reasoning and state the final symbolic answer, as the result is a transfinite cardinal number, not a standard integer or float.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_composant_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to a problem in continuum theory\n    regarding the number of composants of a Stone-Cech remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Problem Analysis:\")\n    print(\"Let X be a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and x be a point in X.\")\n    print(\"We need to find the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder, R,\")\n    print(\"where R = Î²(X \\\\ {x}) \\\\ (X \\\\ {x}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Characterize the Remainder R\")\n    print(\"A major theorem in continuum theory states that for a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable\")\n    print(\"continuum X, the remainder R is itself a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continuum.\")\n    print(\"(Non-degenerate means it consists of more than one point).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: State the properties of composants\")\n    print(\"A fundamental property of any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is that it is\")\n    print(\"partitioned into a collection of dense, pairwise disjoint subsets called composants.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the number of composants\")\n    print(\"It is a standard result that the number of composants in any non-degenerate\")\n    print(\"indecomposable continuum is exactly 'c', the cardinality of the continuum.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"Since the remainder R is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, it must have 'c' composants.\")\n    print(\"This number is a fixed result of the structure of R, so the maximum possible number is 'c'.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the number of composants is based on these mathematical constants:\")\n    \n    # Define the symbolic 'numbers' for the final equation printout\n    num_composants_symbol = \"c\"\n    base = 2\n    exponent = \"aleph_0\" # Unicode for aleph is \\u2135, but we'll use a string for clarity.\n    \n    print(f\"Number of composants = {num_composants_symbol} = {base}^({exponent})\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the reasoning and the answer.\nsolve_composant_problem()\n\n# The final answer is c, the cardinality of the continuum.\n# In the required format, we provide the symbol for this number.\nprint(\"\\n<<<c>>>\")\n```"
