    Solves the problem of finding for how many natural numbers n the described
    matrices exist.

    The problem is equivalent to finding the values of n for which there exists
    an n-dimensional division algebra over the real numbers. A fundamental theorem
    in mathematics states that such algebras only exist for dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8.

    - n=1: The real numbers. We can choose A_1 = [1]. For any non-zero x in R, A_1*x = x is linearly independent.
    - n=2: The complex numbers. Matrices representing multiplication by 1 and i work.
    - n=4: The quaternions. Matrices representing multiplication by 1, i, j, k work.
    - n=8: The octonions. Matrices representing multiplication by the basis elements work.
    - For odd n >= 3, it can be shown that such matrices do not exist using a topological argument (Intermediate Value Theorem on a sphere).
    - For other even n, the non-existence is a deep result from algebraic topology.
