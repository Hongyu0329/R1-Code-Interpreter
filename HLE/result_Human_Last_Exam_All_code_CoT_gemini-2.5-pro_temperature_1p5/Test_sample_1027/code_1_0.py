    # Step 1: Decompose the group G.
    # The group G is generated by g and h. We can define a homomorphism
    # phi: G -> R^2 by looking at the asymptotic translations.
    # phi(f) = (a, b) if f(x) ~ x+a at -infinity and f(x) ~ x+b at +infinity.
    # For the generators:
    # g(x) = x+1 for x < 0, g(x) = x for x > 2. Thus, phi(g) = (1, 0).
    # h(x) = x for x < 0, h(x) = x+2 for x > 2. Thus, phi(h) = (0, 2).
    # The image of phi is a lattice isomorphic to Z^2.
    # Let K be the kernel of phi. K is the normal subgroup of elements with compact support.
    # This gives a short exact sequence of groups: 1 -> K -> G -> Z^2 -> 1.

    # Step 2: Use the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre (LHS) spectral sequence.
    # For this group extension, the LHS spectral sequence relates the homology of K, Z^2, and G.
    # The E^2 page is given by E^2_{p,q} = H_p(Z^2, H_q(K)).
    # This sequence converges to H_{p+q}(G).
    # We are interested in H_31(G), so we need to analyze terms with p+q = 31.

    # Step 3: Analyze the homology of Z^2 and K.
    # The homology of Z^2 with real coefficients is known:
    # H_p(Z^2) is non-zero only for p=0, 1, 2.
    # The group K is a subgroup of PL_{c,+}(R), the group of compactly supported,
    # orientation-preserving, piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the real line.
    # A deep result states that for such groups, the higher homology often vanishes.
    # For PL_{c,+}(R) itself, H_q(PL_{c,+}(R); R) = 0 for q >= 2.
    # We can assume that its subgroup K also has this property.
    explanation.append("\nStep 3: We assume H_q(K; R) = 0 for q >= 2.")
    explanation.append("This is based on known results for larger groups of homeomorphisms containing K.")


    # Step 4: Compute the E^2 page terms for p+q = 31.
    # We only need to consider p=0, 1, 2.
    # For p=0, q=31: E^2_{0,31} = H_0(Z^2, H_31(K)).
    # For p=1, q=30: E^2_{1,30} = H_1(Z^2, H_30(K)).
    # For p=2, q=29: E^2_{2,29} = H_2(Z^2, H_29(K)).
    # Since H_q(K) = 0 for q = 29, 30, 31, all these E^2 terms are 0.
    explanation.append("\nStep 4: All terms E^2_{p,q} on the anti-diagonal p+q=31 are zero.")


    # Step 5: Conclude the dimension of H_31(G).
    # If all terms on an anti-diagonal of the E^2 page are zero, the corresponding
    # homology group of the total space is also zero.
    # Therefore, H_31(G) = 0. The dimension is 0.
