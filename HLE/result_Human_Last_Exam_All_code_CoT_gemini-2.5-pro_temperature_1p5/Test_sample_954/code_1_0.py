def solve_graph_process():
    """
    This function analyzes the graph process and provides the three-digit number
    corresponding to the bounds on the number of steps for the three cases.

    The analysis shows that the maximum number of steps, T, is tightly bounded by
    the maximum degree of the forest, Delta_max. T = Theta(Delta_max).

    Case 1: Forest with max degree at most sqrt(log n).
    T = Theta(sqrt(log n)).
    This corresponds to category 6: omega(2^sqrt(log log n)) but O(log^0.9 n).

    Case 2: Forest with max degree at most log n.
    T = Theta(log n).
    This corresponds to category 8: Theta(log n).

    Case 3: Any forest.
    The max degree can be up to n-1, so T can be Theta(n).
    This corresponds to category 9: omega(log n).

    The resulting three-digit number is formed by these category numbers.
