    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a d=3 system using the epsilon expansion, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Epsilon (ϵ) Parameter**: The epsilon expansion is a technique used to study critical phenomena near the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. For the Ising universality class (which is the standard assumption for this type of question), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as the difference `d_c - d`.\n2.  **State the Model**: The question relates to universal scaling exponents, so we use the O(N) model. For the simplest case of a scalar order parameter (like the Ising model), we set `N=1`.\n3.  **Use the First-Order Expansion Formula**: We will use the established formula for the exponent `α` calculated to the first order in `ϵ`:\n    `α = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Calculate the Result**: Substitute the values `d=3`, `d_c=4`, `N=1` into the formula to find the numerical value for `α`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, showing each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\n#\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the parameters for the epsilon expansion calculation.\n#    - N: The number of components of the order parameter (N=1 for the Ising model).\n#    - d: The spatial dimension of the system.\n#    - d_c: The upper critical dimension for this model.\n# 2. Calculate the expansion parameter, epsilon = d_c - d.\n# 3. Use the first-order expansion formula for the specific heat exponent alpha.\n#    alpha = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * epsilon\n# 4.
