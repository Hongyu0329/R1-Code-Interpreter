# The user wants to identify the strategy that does NOT help mitigate
# the identifiability issue in time-varying birth-death models.

# The options are:
# A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces
# B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework
# C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined par polynomials of degree 5
# D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors...
# E. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate
# F. Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny...
# G. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate

# Reasoning:
# - Strategies B, D, E, F, and G are known methods to address the identifiability issue.
# - Priors (B) add information to constrain the parameter space.
# - Fossils (D, F) add direct evidence of extinction, breaking the ambiguity.
# - Reparametrization (E, G) shifts the inference target to quantities that are identifiable from the data.
# - Strategy A simplifies the model, which is a form of regularization. While it doesn't solve the core problem within each piece, simplification is a common approach to handle ill-posed problems. It attempts to mitigate, even if weakly.
# - Strategy C, however, makes the model vastly more complex. Adding flexibility and parameters to an already unidentifiable model makes the problem worse, not better. It increases the number of parameter combinations that can yield the same likelihood.
# - Therefore, strategy C is the one that does not help.

correct_answer = 'C'

print(f"The strategy that does NOT help mitigate the identifiability issue is C.")
print("This is because fitting an extremely complex and flexible model (like one with high-degree polynomials) to a problem that is already unidentifiable in its simpler form will only exacerbate the issue by creating an even larger set of parameter combinations that yield the same likelihood.")
