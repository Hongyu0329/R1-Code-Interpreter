# The problem asks for the smallest value 'z' such that for any positive semidefinite
# matrix 'A' with unit diagonal, there exist a "nice" matrix 'B' and a positive
# semidefinite matrix 'C' satisfying A = z*B - C.

# A "nice" matrix is the covariance matrix of unbiased +/-1 Bernoulli random variables.
# This means its elements B_ij are E[X_i * X_j] for X_i in {-1, 1}. The set of
# such matrices is the convex hull of rank-one matrices x*x^T where x is a vector
# of -1s and 1s. This is also known as the cut polytope.

# A is a correlation matrix (positive semidefinite with 1s on the diagonal).

# The condition A = z*B - C can be rewritten as z*B - A = C.
# Since C must be positive semidefinite, this is equivalent to z*B >= A in the
# Loewner order (meaning the matrix z*B - A is positive semidefinite).

# This problem is a standard one in semidefinite programming, and the smallest
# such 'z' is a famous mathematical constant called the Grothendieck constant, K_G.
# It is defined as the supremum of a ratio derived from a dual formulation of this
# very problem.
#
# z = sup_{n, P} [ max_{A is correlation} Tr(P*A) ] / [ max_{x in {-1,1}^n} x^T * P * x ]
# where the supremum is over all dimensions n and all non-zero positive semidefinite
# matrices P. This constant is precisely K_G.

# The exact value of K_G is unknown. However, there are well-known bounds:
# 1.6769 < K_G <= pi / (2 * ln(1 + sqrt(2))) ~= 1.7822
# The answer choice C, 1.783, is a numerical approximation of K_G.
# The answer choice E, K_G, is the exact symbolic answer.

# To fulfill the request for code outputting an equation, we will use the
# approximate numerical value of K_G. We can illustrate the equation
# A = z*B - C with a simple 1x1 case.
# Let A = [1]. A is psd and has a unit diagonal.
# Let B = [1]. B is a "nice" matrix (from x=[1]).
# Let z be the constant K_G.
# Then C = z*B - A = z*1 - 1 = z-1.
# Since K_G > 1, C is a positive number, and the 1x1 matrix [C] is positive semidefinite.
# This confirms the relationship holds in this simple case.
