    "To solve this problem, we will reduce the discrete-time system to its observer canonical form using the principle of duality. The process involves these main steps:\n\n1.  **Form the Dual System**: The observer design problem for a system `(A, C)` is dual to the controller design problem for a system `(A_d, B_d)`, where `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n2.  **Transform the Dual System**: We will find a state transformation `z_d = T_c * x_d` that converts the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` into its controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`.\n3.  **Find the New C Matrix**: The matrices for the observer canonical form of the original system, `(A_o, C_o)`, are the transposes of the controller canonical form matrices. Specifically, the new output matrix `C_o` is the transpose of `B_c`. `C_o = B_c^T`.\n\nThe procedure for finding the transformation matrix `T_c` for the multi-input dual system is as follows:\na.  Construct the controllability matrix of the dual system, `Co = [B_d, A_d*B_d, ...]`.\nb.  Select `n` (where `n=3` is the system order) linearly independent column vectors from `Co` in the specific order `[b_1, b_2, ..., A_d*b_1, A_d*b_2, ...]`. This forms a basis matrix `M`.\nc.  Calculate the inverse of `M`.\nd.  Construct the transformation matrix `T_c` using specific rows of `M_inv` and `A_d`, based on the controllability indices of the system.\ne.  Calculate `B_c = T_c * B_d`.\nf.  Finally, obtain the new C matrix for the observer canonical form by `C_o = B_c^T`.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to compute the new C matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set print options for better readability\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)\n\n# Step 1: Define the original system matrices\nA = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n              [2, 1, 1],\n              [0, 2, 0]])\n\nC = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n              [1, 1, 0]])\n\n# Step 2: Form the dual system\n# The dual system is x_d(k+1) = A_d*x_d(k) + B_d*u_d(k)\n# where A_d = A^T and B_d = C^T\nA_d = A.T\nB_d = C.T\n\n# Step 3: Find the transformation matrix T_c for controller canonical form\n# First, we select n=3 linearly independent columns from the controllability matrix\n# Co = [B_d, A_d*B_d, ...].\n# The columns of B_d are b1 and b2.\nb1 = B_d[:, 0]\nb2 = B_d[:, 1]\nAd_b1 = A_d @ b1\n\n# The standard procedure for selecting linearly independent vectors is to check\n# b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ... in order.\n# The set {b1, b2, A_d*b1} is linearly independent for this system.\n# We form the matrix M from these vectors.\nM = np.column_stack([b1, b2, Ad_b1])\n\n# This selection implies controllability indices mu_1=2 (from the b1 chain)\n# and mu_2=1 (from the b2 chain). The sum is 3, the order of the system.\n\n# The transformation matrix T_c is constructed using rows from the inverse of M.\nif np.linalg.matrix_rank(M) == A.shape[0]:\n    M_inv = np.linalg.inv(M)\n\n    # The transformation T_c depends on rows from M_inv corresponding to the end of each\n    # vector chain used to build M.
