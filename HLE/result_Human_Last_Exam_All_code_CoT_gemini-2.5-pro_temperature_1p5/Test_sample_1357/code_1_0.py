    """
    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves
    with good Jacobian reduction.

    This is a combinatorial problem based on two main constraints:
    1. Good reduction of the Jacobian implies the dual graph of the stable
       reduction is a tree. This means the sum of the genera of the
       irreducible components equals the total genus, 4.
    2. The stability condition requires that any genus-0 component (a rational
       curve) must connect to the other components at 3 or more points. In
       the dual graph, this means a genus-0 vertex must have a degree of at least 3.

    The method is to enumerate all partitions of 4 into non-negative integers (genera)
    and, for each partition, count the number of valid tree structures.
