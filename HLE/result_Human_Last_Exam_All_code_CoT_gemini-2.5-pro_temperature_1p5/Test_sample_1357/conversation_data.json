    "This problem asks for the number of combinatorial types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve under the specific condition that its Jacobian has good reduction. I will solve this by using the properties of stable curves and the implications of good Jacobian reduction.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the \"Good Jacobian Reduction\" Constraint:** The Semistable Reduction Theorem, particularly the work of Raynaud, establishes a deep connection between the reduction of a curve and its Jacobian. A key result states that if the Jacobian of a curve has good reduction, the dual graph of its stable reduction must be a tree. This means it has no cycles.\n\n2.  **Apply the Genus Formula:** For a stable curve `C` with `r` irreducible components `C_i` of geometric genera `g_i` and `δ` nodes, its arithmetic genus `p_a(C)` is given by the formula:\n    `p_a(C) = Σ g_i + δ - r + 1`\n    The term `δ - r + 1` is the first Betti number of the dual graph, `b_1(G)`. The condition that the dual graph is a tree implies `b_1(G) = 0`.\n    Given that the arithmetic genus of the reduction is `p_a(C) = 4`, the formula simplifies to:\n    `4 = Σ g_i + 0`, so `Σ g_i = 4`.\n    This means we need to find all partitions of the number 4 into a sum of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the genus of a component curve.\n\n3.  **Apply the Stability Condition:** A stable curve requires that any rational component (a component with genus `g_i = 0`, which is a `P^1`) must be stable. This means it must intersect the other components in at least 3 points. In the dual graph, this translates to the condition that any vertex corresponding to a `g_i = 0` component must have a degree of at least 3.\n\n4.  **Enumerate and Count:** I will systematically enumerate all possible configurations by:\n    a.  Finding all partitions of the integer 4 into sums of positive integers `g_i > 0`. For each partition, find all possible tree structures for the dual graph.\n    b.  Considering partitions that include `g_i = 0` components. For each such case, find all tree structures that satisfy the degree condition for the genus-0 vertices.\n\n5.  **Python Script:** I will implement this enumeration in a Python script. The script will outline the logic for each case and sum the number of valid types to find the final answer. As requested, the script will print out the numbers that add up to the total.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves\n    with good Jacobian reduction.\n\n    This is a combinatorial problem based on two main constraints:\n    1. Good reduction of the Jacobian implies the dual graph of the stable\n       reduction is a tree. This means the sum of the genera of the\n       irreducible components equals the total genus, 4.\n    2. The stability condition requires that any genus-0 component (a rational\n       curve) must connect to the other components at 3 or more points. In\n       the dual graph, this means a genus-0 vertex must have a degree of at least 3.\n\n    The method is to enumerate all partitions of 4 into non-negative integers (genera)\n    and, for each partition, count the number of valid tree structures.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Finding the number of stable reduction types for a genus 4 curve with good Jacobian reduction.\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to finding all possible dual graph structures satisfying the stability conditions.\\n\")\n\n    # A 'type' is a unique combination of a genus partition and a valid tree graph.\n    \n    types = []\n\n    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # Case 1: Components with genus > 0 only.\n    # In this case, there's no degree constraint on the vertices.\n    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Counting types where all components have genus > 0.\")\n    \n    # Genus Partition: (4).
