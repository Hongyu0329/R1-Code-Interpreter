    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, considering both its dissolution and the formation of a complex ion.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Chemical Reactions**: The dissolution of solid Al(OH)₃ is governed by two main equilibrium reactions in water:\n    *   The simple dissolution into ions:\n        `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)` with equilibrium constant `K_sp`.\n    *   The formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion from the dissolved aluminum ion:\n        `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)` with equilibrium constant `K_f`.\n\n2.  **Define Solubility (S)**: The total molar solubility (S) is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n    *   `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n3.  **Establish Charge Balance**: For the solution to remain electrically neutral, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges. The ions in solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    *   `3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n4.  **Express Concentrations in Terms of [OH⁻]**: Using the equilibrium constant expressions, we can write the concentrations of the aluminum species and H⁺ as functions of the hydroxide concentration, [OH⁻].\n    *   From K_sp: `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n    *   From K_sp and K_f: `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n    *   From the autoionization of water (Kw): `[H+] = Kw / [OH^-]`\n\n5.  **Solve for [OH⁻]**: Substitute the expressions from Step 4 into the charge balance equation from Step 3. This will yield a single polynomial equation with [OH⁻] as the only unknown variable. Solving this equation gives the equilibrium hydroxide concentration.\n\n6.  **Calculate Solubility (S)**: Once the equilibrium [OH⁻] is known, substitute its value back into the equations from Step 4 to find the concentrations of [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻]. The sum of these concentrations gives the total solubility, S.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nK_sp = 5.3 * 10**(-27)\nK_f = 1.1 * 10**31\nKw = 1.0 * 10**(-14)  # Autoionization constant of water\n\n# --- 1. Derivation of the equation for [OH-] ---\n# The charge balance equation is: 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n# We substitute the expressions for each concentration in terms of [OH-]:\n# [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3\n# [Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH-]\n# [H+] = Kw / [OH-]\n#\n# Substituting these gives:\n# 3 * (K_sp / [OH-]^3) + (Kw / [OH-]) = [OH-] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH-])\n#\n# Multiplying by [OH-]^3 to clear denominators gives a polynomial in [OH-]:\n# 3*K_sp + Kw*[OH-]^2 = [OH-]^4 + K_sp*K_f*[OH-]^4\n#\n# Rearranging into a standard form:\n# (1 + K_sp*K_f)*[OH-]^4 - Kw*[OH-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\n#\n# This is a quadratic equation for the variable x = [OH-]^2.\n# A*x^2 + B*x + C = 0 where:\nA = 1 + K_sp * K_f\nB = -Kw\nC = -3 * K_sp\n\n# --- 2. Solve the quadratic equation for [OH-]^2 ---\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = (-B + sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n# We take the positive root because concentration squared must be positive.\ndiscriminant = B**2 - 4 * A * C\nOH_conc_squared = (-B + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * A)\n\n# --- 3. Calculate [OH-] ---\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(OH_conc_squared)\n\n# --- 4. Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species ---\nAl3_conc = K_sp / (OH_conc**3)\nAlOH4_conc = K_sp * K_f * OH_conc\n\n# --- 5. Calculate the total solubility (S) ---\nsolubility = Al3_conc + AlOH4_conc\n\n# --- 6.
