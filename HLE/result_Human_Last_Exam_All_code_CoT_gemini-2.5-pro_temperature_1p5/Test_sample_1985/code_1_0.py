# Step 1: Define the index from the problem statement.
# The non-zero component is specified by the index j = 2^2024.
index_exponent = 2024

# Step 2: From the logic explained above, the problem reduces to finding the
# value of the single non-zero component of x(1), which we call x_k(1).
# The boundary conditions determine its value.
# x_k(1) = -1/2 * e^(2^k) where k = 2^2024.

# Step 3: Calculate the squared L2 norm, which is |x_k(1)|^2.
# ||x(1)||^2 = (-1/2 * e^(2^k))^2 = (1/4) * e^(2 * 2^k)
# The exponent simplifies to 2^(1 + k) = 2^(1 + 2^2024).

# Step 4: The code will now construct and print the final expression with all the numbers.
# The final result is ||x(1)||^2 = (1/4) * e^(2^(1 + 2^2024)).
