    "My plan is to identify the shortest forced checkmating sequence for Black from the given chess position.\n\n1.  **Reconstruct the Board**: I will first process the sequence of moves provided to set up the final board state. To ensure accuracy, I'll use the `python-chess` library, which can parse game notations reliably.\n2.  **Analyze the Position**: The White King is on g5, which is highly exposed. This suggests that a mating attack is likely. A \"mate in X\" problem requires finding a sequence that forces a win against the opponent's best possible defense (i.e., the one that delays the mate the longest).\n3.  **Identify the Mating Sequence**: Through analysis, I've found a forced mate-in-4. The sequence begins with a check (`...h5+`) which forces White into a difficult situation. While White has responses that can lead to a slightly faster mate, the best defense prolongs the game to a mate on Black's fourth move.\n4.  **Generate the Code**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Sets up the board to the correct position.\n    *   Programmatically executes the moves of the determined mating sequence.\n    *   For each move, it will generate the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), as requested.\n    *   Finally, it will print the full sequence of moves for both Black and White, without move numbers.\n\n```python\nimport chess\nimport chess.pgn\nimport io\n\ndef find_mating_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function sets up a chess board from a given PGN, finds the shortest\n    forced mating sequence, and prints it in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The PGN of the game leading to the puzzle position.\n    pgn_string = \"1. e4 c6 2. c4 e6 3.
