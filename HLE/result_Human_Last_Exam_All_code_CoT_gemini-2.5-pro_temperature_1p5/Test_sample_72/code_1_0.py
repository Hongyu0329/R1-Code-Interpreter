# The puzzle is to find the single grammatically incorrect sentence.
# My analysis suggests a system of rules. The key inconsistency is found
# by comparing sentence 7 and sentence 9.

# Let's outline the core rules for transitive sentences with 'esku'.
# Noun Groups: Group 1 = {Dokuj, Ketan}, Group 2 = {Ezsu, Kergo}.
# This grouping is derived from which sentences use 'kaij' (same group) vs 'kosaij' (different groups).

# Sentences 7, 8, 9, 11 are transitive sentences with 'esku'.
# S7: Ezsuet(G2) kergoet(G2) esku otazsij kaij. (Same group -> kaij)
# S8: Kergoet(G2) dokujet(G1) esku otazsij kosaij. (Diff group -> kosaij)
# S9: Dokujet(G1) ketanne(G1) esku otazsij kaij. (Same group -> kaij)
# S11: Dokujet(G1) ezsuet(G2) esku otazsij kosaij. (Diff group -> kosaij)

# The rule for particles 'kaij' vs 'kosaij' is perfectly consistent.
# Now let's examine the case of the object noun in these sentences.
# Case endings: -et (Ergative), -e (Absolutive).

# S7 Object: kergoet (Ergative case)
# S8 Object: dokujet (Ergative case)
# S11 Object: ezsuet (Ergative case)

# In sentences 7, 8, and 11, the object is consistently in the Ergative (-et) case.
# Let's hypothesize a rule: "In a transitive sentence with 'esku', the object must be in the Ergative case."

# Now let's check Sentence 9 against this rule.
# S9 Object: ketanne (Absolutive case)

# Sentence 9 violates this rule. The object 'ketanne' is in the Absolutive case, while
# all other comparable sentences (7, 8, 11) have their object in the Ergative case.
# Therefore, sentence 9 is the one that is not grammatically well-formed.

incorrect_sentence_number = 9
print(f"The grammatically incorrect sentence is number {incorrect_sentence_number}.")
print(f"Let's break down the logic:")
print(f"Rule: In complex transitive sentences (containing 'esku'), the object noun takes the '-et' (Ergative) case.")
print(f"Sentence 7: Ezsuet kergoet esku otazsij kaij. -> Object 'kergoet' ends in '-et'. This is consistent.")
print(f"Sentence 8: Kergoet dokujet esku otazsij kosaij. -> Object 'dokujet' ends in '-et'. This is consistent.")
print(f"Sentence 11: Dokujet ezsuet esku otazsij kosaij. -> Object 'ezsuet' ends in '-et'. This is consistent.")
print(f"Sentence 9: Dokujet ketanne esku otazsij kaij. -> Object 'ketanne' ends in '-e'. This is the violation.")
print(f"Final Answer: {incorrect_sentence_number}")
