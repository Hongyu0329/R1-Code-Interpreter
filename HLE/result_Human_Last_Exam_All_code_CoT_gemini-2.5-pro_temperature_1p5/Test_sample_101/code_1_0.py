    print("1. Identify the core concepts: The question links a specific type of feedback (concrete, next-steps) with long-term interest development within Hidi and Renninger's model.")
    print("2. Analyze the feedback's purpose: This feedback is designed to build competence and provide clear guidance, which fosters self-efficacy.")
    print("3. Evaluate the feedback's impact at each phase:")
    print("   - Triggered Interest: A student's engagement is too brief and fragile for this feedback to have a lasting impact.")
    print("   - Maintained Interest: Feedback is useful for task engagement, but the interest is still situational and externally driven.")
    print("   - Emerging Individual Interest: This is the critical transition point. The student is internally motivated but needs to build skills. Concrete feedback provides the exact support needed to turn this fragile interest into a stable, long-term one. This is the stage of maximum impact.")
    print("   - Well-Developed Interest: The student is already self-sufficient. Feedback is helpful but not as developmentally critical for establishing the interest itself.")

    correct_answer_key = "C"
    explanation = (
        "A student with emerging individual interest (Phase 3) is at the most critical juncture for long-term interest development. "
        "They have started to value the topic personally and engage voluntarily, but their knowledge and skills are still developing. "
        "Receiving concrete feedback with immediate next steps provides the perfect support to build their competence and self-efficacy. "
        "This success reinforces their positive feelings and personal connection to the subject, making it highly likely to solidify their interest for the long term, pushing them towards a well-developed individual interest."
