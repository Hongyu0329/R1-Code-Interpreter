    "The problem asks for the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. This number corresponds to the dimension of the 10th-degree homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements (X and Y).\n\nThis dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} mu(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order (degree), which is 10 in this case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `mu(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nThe steps to solve this are:\n1.  Identify the parameters: `n=10`, `k=2`.\n2.  Find all divisors of `n=10`. The divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n3.  Calculate the Möbius function `mu(d)` for each divisor `d`:\n    *   `mu(1) = 1`\n    *   `mu(2) = -1` (2 is prime)\n    *   `mu(5) = -1` (5 is prime)\n    *   `mu(10) = mu(2*5) = mu(2)*mu(5) = (-1)*(-1) = 1`\n4.  Apply Witt's formula by summing the terms `mu(d) * k^(n/d)` for each divisor `d`.\n5.  Divide the final sum by `n=10`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\n    Returns None if a factor is repeated (e.g., for 12 = 2*2*3).\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        if temp_num % d == 0:\n            if d in factors:\n                return None # Repeated factor\n            factors[d] = 1\n            temp_num //= d\n            # Check if the factor is repeated\n            if temp_num % d == 0:\n                return None\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        if temp_num in factors:\n            return None # Repeated factor\n        factors[temp_num] = 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    mu(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    mu(n) = 1 for n=1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    \n    if factors is None: # Has a squared prime factor\n        return 0\n    \n    # Square-free, return (-1)^k where k is the number of prime factors\n    return (-1) ** len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coeffs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients for a given order in the BCH expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order of the expansion\n    k = 2   # Number of non-commuting variables (X and Y)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    term_strings = []\n    value_strings = []\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (k ** power)\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        term_strings.append(f\"mu({d})*({k}^{power})\")\n        value_strings.append(f\"{mu_d}*({k**power})\")\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients is given by Witt's formula L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum_{{d|n}} mu(d) * k^(n/d)\")\n    print(f\"For n={n} and k={k}, the divisors of {n} are: {divisors}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(term_strings) + \" )\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(value_strings).replace(\"+-\", \"- \") + \" )\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ( {total_sum} )\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = {result}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bch_coeffs()\n    print(\"<<<99>>>\")\n\n```"
