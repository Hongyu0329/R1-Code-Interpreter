No. The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric. Materials with this type of crystal symmetry have a second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of zero, which forbids them from exhibiting second-order nonlinear optical processes like spontaneous parametric downconversion.
