    "This is a conceptual question about material properties. My plan is to first explain the physical requirements for a material to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Then, I will examine the known properties of free-standing boron nanosheets to see if they meet these requirements. The core of the analysis hinges on crystal symmetry.\n\n1.  **SPDC Requirements**: SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. For it to occur, the material must have a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  **Symmetry Rule**: Materials that possess a center of inversion (are centrosymmetric) are forbidden by symmetry from having a non-zero χ⁽²⁾. Therefore, only non-centrosymmetric materials can exhibit SPDC.\n3.  **Boron Nanosheet Structure**: I will check the crystal structure of the common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (also known as borophene).\n4.  **Conclusion**: By determining if these structures are centrosymmetric, I can conclude whether they are expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\nI will use a Python script to print this explanation step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef explain_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains, based on physical principles, whether free-standing boron\n    nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Introduction to the core physical process\n    print(\"Analysis: Can Boron Nanosheets Exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"1.
