    "My plan is to answer this biological question based on established cephalopod neuroanatomy. Since the prompt requires a code-based solution, I will create a simple Python script that prints the answer to the user's question. The script will store the names of the relevant brain regions in a list and then print them in a formatted sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the brain regions posterior to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \n    This information is based on established neuroanatomical research on cephalopods,\n    particularly of the genus Sepia.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The palliovisceral lobe is part of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n    # The lobes located adjacent and posterior to it are primarily the giant fiber lobes\n    # and the posterior chromatophore lobes.\n    \n    posterior_regions = [\"giant fiber lobes\", \"posterior chromatophore lobes\"]\n    \n    answer = f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the {posterior_regions[0]} and the {posterior_regions[1]}.\"\n    \n    print(answer)\n\nfind_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the giant fiber lobes and the posterior chromatophore lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
