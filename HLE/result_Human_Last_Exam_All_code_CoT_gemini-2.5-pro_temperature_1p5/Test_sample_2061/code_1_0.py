    # The problem as stated leads to no positive real solutions.

    # We assume a typo in the sign of B to demonstrate the solution method.
    B_val = -0.5 * (10**20) / (99**2)

    # Step 2: Establish the relationship y_0^4 = K - x_0^4.
    # From perturbation analysis, the solvability condition is:
    # (x_0^4 + y_0^4) * (1 - exp(-3T))/3 = alpha
    # So, K = (x_0^4 + y_0^4) = 3 * alpha / (1 - np.exp(-3*T))

    # Step 3: Evaluate the integral.
    # The integral is I = integral from 0 to A of (K - x_0^4) * x_0^3 dx_0.
    # Using substitution u = x_0^4, the integral evaluates to:
    # I = (K * A^4 / 4) - (A^8 / 8)

    # Step 4: Express A and K in terms of alpha.
