No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is entirely dependent on the perception of natural predators (like birds), not humans. Human visual systems differ fundamentally from those of many predators, most notably in our inability to see the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which is a key component of bee coloration and warning signals. Therefore, using human-perceived similarity as a proxy for functional mimicry is a critical flaw, as it ignores the sensory and cognitive world of the predators that the signals are meant to influence.
