# The problem asks for the number of positive integers n for which the n-cube [0,1]^n
# fails to occur as the set of non-block points of any continuum.

# --- Step 1: Topological Simplification ---
# A key theorem states that the set of non-block points N(X) of a continuum X is dense in X.
# If N(X) were homeomorphic to [0,1]^n, it would be compact.
# A dense and compact subset of a Hausdorff space must be the space itself.
# Thus, X must be homeomorphic to [0,1]^n.
# The problem reduces to: For which n is the set of non-block points of [0,1]^n,
# N([0,1]^n), not equal to the entire space [0,1]^n?

# --- Step 2: Analysis of n ---
# We analyze the two distinct cases for n.

# Case n = 1: The Interval [0,1]
# For n=1, any point p in the interior (0,1) is a "cut point".
# Removing it disconnects the space [0,1] into [0, p) U (p, 1].
# A disconnected space cannot contain a continuum-connected dense subset.
# Therefore, these interior points are not non-block points.
# So, N([0,1]^1) is not equal to [0,1]^1.
# This means n=1 is a value for which the property fails.
n_is_1_fails = True
count_for_n1 = 1 if n_is_1_fails else 0
failing_values = [1]

# Case n >= 2: The n-cube [0,1]^n
# For n >= 2, removing any point p from [0,1]^n leaves a space that is still
# path-connected. One can always construct a path between any two points
# that avoids p.
# A path-connected space is also continuum-connected.
# Thus, for any p, [0,1]^n \ {p} contains a continuum-connected dense subset (itself).
# Therefore, every point is a non-block point, and N([0,1]^n) = [0,1]^n for n >= 2.
# This means for n>=2, the property holds.
count_for_n_greater_than_1 = 0

# --- Step 3: Final Calculation ---
total_failing_n_count = count_for_n1 + count_for_n_greater_than_1
