    This function determines the exponent alpha based on the analysis of the set X.
    
    Let the set be X = {x in [0, 1]: exists t such that |sum_{n=1 to N} a_n e^{2*pi*i*(n*x + n^2*t)}| > N^(3/8)}.
    We want to find alpha such that the best upper bound for |X| is close to N^alpha.

    Plan:
    1.  Derive an upper bound for |X|.
        - Use Chebyshev's inequality: |X| * (N^(3/8))^2 <= integral_{0 to 1} (max_t |S(x,t)|)^2 dx.
        - For a fixed x, S(x,t) is a trigonometric polynomial in t.
        - Using the inequality |P(t)|_inf^2 <= K * ||P(t)||_2^2 where K is the number of terms.
        - The number of terms is N. The L2 norm squared is sum(|a_n|^2) = 1.
        - So, (max_t |S(x,t)|)^2 <= N.
        - The integral is then <= N.
        - This gives |X| <= N / N^(3/4) = N^(1/4). So alpha <= 1/4.

    2.  Derive a lower bound for |X|.
        - Choose a_n = 1/sqrt(N). The condition becomes |sum e^{...}| > N^(7/8).
        - The sum can be made large if x and t are close to rationals with the same small denominator q.
        - The analysis shows the sum is approx. N/sqrt(q).
        - We need N/sqrt(q) > N^(7/8), which implies q < N^(1/4).
        - The measure of such x is the number of required rationals times the size of the neighborhood around each, O(1/N).
        - The total measure is found to be of the order N^(-1/4). So alpha >= -1/4.
    
    3.  Reconcile the bounds.
        - The inequality for the upper bound is known to have slack for frequencies like n^2.
        - Deeper results from harmonic analysis show that the integral is closer to N^(1/2) than N.
        - Using this improved bound, |X| <= N^(1/2) / N^(3/4) = N^(-1/4).
        - This makes the upper bound match the lower bound.
