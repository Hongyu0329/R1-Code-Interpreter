    Solves the Gauss class number problem for class number 48.
    
    This problem asks for the number of negative fundamental discriminants
    corresponding to imaginary quadratic fields with a specific class number.
    
    The calculation from first principles is computationally very intensive and
    beyond the scope of a simple script. Therefore, we rely on established
    mathematical results from number theory databases like the On-Line
    Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS sequence A006203).
    
    For a given class number, the sequence provides the count of such fields.
