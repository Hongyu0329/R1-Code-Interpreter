    Calculates the critical exponent nu (ν) in the G₄-theoretical (Landau-Ginzburg) framework.

    The derivation gives the mean-field value, which is exact for spatial dimensions d >= 4.
    For d < 4, this value is a first approximation that is corrected by fluctuation effects.
    Given the general d-dimensional context without specifying d < 4, the mean-field result is the fundamental answer from the theory.
