    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM) reaction followed by an electrophilic quench.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  **Identify the starting material:** The substrate is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. It has a benzene ring with two functional groups that can direct the reaction: a diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) at position 1 and a dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3.\n2.  **Analyze the first reaction step:** The reagent system is sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium) and TMEDA. This is a powerful base combination used for deprotonation, specifically for creating an organolithium species. The directing groups on the aromatic ring will guide this deprotonation to an ortho position. Both the amide and the amine are strong ortho-directing groups. The proton at position 2 is ortho to both groups, making it the most acidic and the prime site for deprotonation (lithiation).\n3.  **Analyze the second reaction step:** The intermediate organolithium compound, which is a strong nucleophile, is then reacted with methyl iodide (CH₃I). Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The nucleophilic carbon on the benzene ring (at position 2) will attack the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n4.  **Determine the final product:** A methyl group will be added to the benzene ring at position 2. I will then write a Python script to print the full name of the resulting compound.\n\n```python\ndef get_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the product of a two-step organic reaction.\n    Step 1: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-BuLi/TMEDA.\n            This is a directed ortho-metalation. The most acidic proton is at C-2,\n            as it is ortho to both the strong directing diethylamide group and the\n            dimethylamino group. Lithiation occurs at this position.\n    Step 2: The resulting organolithium intermediate is quenched with methyl iodide (CH3I).\n            The nucleophilic lithiated carbon attacks the electrophilic methyl group,\n            substituting the lithium with a methyl group.\n    \"\"\"\n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    # The reaction adds a methyl group at position 2.\n    final_product_name = \"N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    print(f\"The final compound obtained is: {final_product_name}\")\n\nget_reaction_product()\n```\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
