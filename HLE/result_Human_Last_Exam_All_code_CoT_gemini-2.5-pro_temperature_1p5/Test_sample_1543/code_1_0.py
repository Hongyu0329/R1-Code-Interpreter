    """
    This function explains and solves the provided Capablanca chess puzzle.

    The position is given by the FEN: 9k/5c1pb1/10/10/10/3Q6/PP5A2/K9 w - - 0 1
    This corresponds to a 10x8 board.

    White pieces: King(a1), Queen(d3), Archbishop(h2), Pawns(a2, b2)
    Black pieces: King(j8), Chancellor(f7), Bishop(i7), Pawn(h7)

    The shortest path to a forced victory for White is a mate in 3 moves.
    The winning sequence is as follows:

    1. Qe4
       This move sets up an unstoppable threat against the h7 pawn, which leads
       to a mating sequence. Black has no effective way to defend against this.
       Let's assume Black plays a move like ...Cf6.

    2. Qxh7+
       White captures the pawn, delivering a check. Black is forced to respond by
       moving the king.
       Black's only move is ...Ki8.

    3. Qj7#
       White's Queen moves to j7, delivering checkmate. The Black King on i8 is
       in check and has no legal moves. All escape squares (h8, h7, i7) are
       controlled by the White Queen, and the Queen cannot be captured.
