# Step 1: Calculate the total number of unique instructions.
# There is 1 'stop' instruction, 2 'turn left' speeds, 2 'turn right' speeds,
# 4 'forward' speeds, and 2 'backward' speeds.
num_stop = 1
num_left = 2
num_right = 2
num_forward = 4
num_backward = 2

total_unique_instructions = num_stop + num_left + num_right + num_forward + num_backward

print(f"1. Calculating the number of unique instructions:")
print(f"   The total number of unique instructions is {num_stop} + {num_left} + {num_right} + {num_forward} + {num_backward} = {total_unique_instructions}.\n")

# Step 2: Calculate the minimum bits needed to represent one instruction.
# We need to find the smallest integer 'n' where 2^n >= total_unique_instructions.
# This can be calculated using the logarithm base 2.
bits_per_instruction = math.ceil(math.log2(total_unique_instructions))

print(f"2. Calculating the bits per instruction:")
print(f"   To represent {total_unique_instructions} unique states, we need {bits_per_instruction} bits per instruction.\n")

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of instructions for one Martian day.
# A Martian day (sol) is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds long.
# An instruction is sent each Earth minute.
hours_in_sol = 24
minutes_in_sol = 39
seconds_in_sol = 35.244

total_minutes = (hours_in_sol * 60) + minutes_in_sol + (seconds_in_sol / 60)
# We need to round up to ensure we cover the entire day.
total_instructions_for_day = math.ceil(total_minutes)

print(f"3. Calculating the total number of instructions for a Martian day:")
print(f"   A Martian day lasts {hours_in_sol} hours, {minutes_in_sol} minutes, and {seconds_in_sol} seconds, which is {total_minutes:.2f} Earth minutes.")
print(f"   Therefore, we need {total_instructions_for_day} instructions to cover the whole day.\n")

# Step 4: Calculate the total bits needed for the entire day.
total_bits = total_instructions_for_day * bits_per_instruction

print(f"4. Calculating the total bits for the day:")
print(f"   Total bits = {total_instructions_for_day} instructions * {bits_per_instruction} bits/instruction = {total_bits} bits.\n")

# Step 5: Convert the total bits to bytes.
# There are 8 bits in a byte.
bits_in_byte = 8
total_bytes = math.ceil(total_bits / bits_in_byte)

print(f"5. Converting bits to bytes:")
print(f"   Total bytes = {total_bits} bits / {bits_in_byte} bits/byte = {total_bytes} bytes.\n")

print("Final Answer:")
print(f"The smallest size of memory required is {total_bytes} bytes.")
