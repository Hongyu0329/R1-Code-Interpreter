    print("Reasoning:")
    print("  A coadjoint orbit O_lambda of a compact Lie group G is a homogeneous space G/L.")
    print("  These spaces are known to be projective algebraic varieties, which means they possess a natural complex structure.")

    # Question (b)
    print("(b) For G = SU(n), with lambda in the Weyl alcove, is the second Betti number b_2(O_lambda) always given by n - 1?")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("  The value of b_2(O_lambda) depends on the specific choice of lambda, which determines the stabilizer of the orbit.")

    b2_regular = 2
    print(f"  In this case, the second Betti number is indeed b_2(SU(3)/T) = {b2_regular}, which matches n - 1.")
    print("  However, if lambda is 'singular' (e.g., two components are equal), the orbit can be the complex projective space CP^{n-1} = CP^2.")
    b2_singular = 1
    print(f"  The second Betti number of CP^2 is b_2(CP^2) = {b2_singular}.")
    print(f"  Here, {b2_singular} != {betti_rank}. Since we have found a counterexample, the statement is not always true.")

    print(f"Conclusion: The statement is {answer_b}.\n")


    # Question (c)
    print("(c) If O_lambda is endowed with a natural equivariant Kähler metric, must the corresponding equivariant cohomology ring H_G*(O_lambda; R) be isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a GKM graph (Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson graph)?")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("  GKM theory provides a combinatorial description for the T-equivariant cohomology ring H_T*(M), where T is a maximal torus, not the G-equivariant cohomology H_G*(M).")
    print("  While coadjoint orbits O_lambda are indeed GKM manifolds with respect to the T-action (meaning H_T*(O_lambda) is a GKM ring), the relationship between H_T*(O_lambda) and H_G*(O_lambda) is complex.")
    print("  The natural map H_T*(O_lambda)^W -> H_G*(O_lambda) (where W is the Weyl group) is not an isomorphism in general for singular orbits.")
    print("  Furthermore, the ring of invariants of a GKM ring is not generally a GKM ring itself. Therefore, there is no guarantee for H_G*(O_lambda) to be isomorphic to a GKM ring.")
