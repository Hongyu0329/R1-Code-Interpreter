    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we need to find the number of independent logical qubits, let's call it `k`. The GSD will then be `2^k`. We'll assume the code is on a sphere (a surface with genus g=0) that has been punctured to create these holes, which act as boundaries.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Logical Qubits:** In the toric code, a logical qubit is defined by a pair of non-local operators, a logical `X` (`bar{X}`) and a logical `Z` (`bar{Z}`), that commute with the Hamiltonian but anticommute with each other.\n\n2.  **Boundaries and Logical Operators:** The presence of boundaries changes which non-local operators commute with the Hamiltonian.\n    *   **Smooth boundaries:** At a smooth boundary, the star operators are complete, but plaquette operators are truncated. This allows strings of `Z` operators to terminate at these boundaries.\n    *   **Rough boundaries:** At a rough boundary, the plaquette operators are complete, but star operators are truncated. This allows strings of `X` operators to terminate at these boundaries.\n\n3.  **Qubits from Smooth Holes:** With `n` smooth holes, we can construct logical qubits. Let's pick one hole, say `S_n`, as a reference.\n    *   For each other hole `S_i` (where `i` goes from 1 to `n-1`), we can define a logical `Z` operator, `bar{Z}_i`, as a string of Pauli-Z operators connecting hole `S_i` to `S_n`.\n    *   The corresponding logical `X` operator, `bar{X}_i`, is a loop of Pauli-X operators that encircles the hole `S_i`.\n    *   This `bar{X}_i` and `bar{Z}_i` pair anticommutes, forming a valid qubit. We can create `n-1` such independent qubits. This construction is valid for `n >= 1` (if `n=1`, `n-1=0`, so 0 qubits).\n\n4.  **Qubits from Rough Holes:** The same logic applies to the `m` rough holes. Let's pick one hole, say `R_m`, as a reference.\n    *   For each other hole `R_j` (where `j` goes from 1 to `m-1`), we can define a logical `X` operator, `bar{X}_j`, as a string of Pauli-X operators connecting hole `R_j` to `R_m`.\n    *   The corresponding logical `Z` operator, `bar{Z}_j`, is a loop of Pauli-Z operators that encircles the hole `R_j`.\n    *   This gives us `m-1` independent qubits from the rough holes. This construction is valid for `m >= 1`.\n\n5.  **Total Number of Qubits:** The set of logical operators associated with smooth holes can be defined on parts of the lattice that do not interfere with the operators for the rough holes. Therefore, the two sets of qubits are independent. The total number of logical qubits `k` is the sum of the qubits from each sector:\n    `k = (qubits from smooth holes) + (qubits from rough holes)`\n    `k = (n-1) + (m-1)`\n    `k = n + m - 2`\n\n6.  **Ground Space Degeneracy:** With `k = n + m - 2` logical qubits, the ground space degeneracy is `2^k`.\n    `GSD = 2^(n+m-2)`\n\nThis formula matches one of the provided answer choices. This derivation assumes that both `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`, which is implied by the problem statement mentioning both types of holes.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that takes `n` and `m` as symbolic inputs and prints the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef ground_space_degeneracy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symbolic ground space degeneracy for the toric code\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define n and m as symbolic variables\n    n = sympy.Symbol('n')\n    m = sympy.Symbol('m')\n\n    # The number of logical qubits, k, is (n-1) + (m-1)\n    k = n + m - 2\n\n    # The ground space degeneracy is 2^k\n    # We will print this in a readable format.\n    print(\"The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is given by the formula:\")\n    \n    # We want to print the equation GSD = 2^(n+m-2), including each number\n    base = 2\n    n_coeff = 1\n    m_coeff = 1\n    constant = -2\n    \n    # Print the equation part by part\n    print(f\"GSD = {base}^({n_coeff}*n + {m_coeff}*m + ({constant}))\")\n    \n    # A cleaner print using sympy for the expression\n    # This shows the logic more clearly.\n    print(\"\\nSymbolic representation of the exponent k:\")\n    print(f\"k = (n - 1) + (m - 1) = {k}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal formula:\")\n    # Print the final expression 2^(n+m-2)\n    final_expression_base = 2\n    final_expression_exponent = k\n\n    print(f\"GSD = {final_expression_base}^({final_expression_exponent})\")\n    # To satisfy the output format of \"each number in the final equation\"\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation with Numbers Explicit:\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^(n + m - 2)\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ground_space_degeneracy()\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
