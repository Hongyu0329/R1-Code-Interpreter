    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Problem Reformulation:** The initial problem is about finding the minimum area of a convex domain `K` that intersects a specific family of lines. We can simplify this by assuming the domain `K` is symmetric about the origin. This is a reasonable assumption because if `K` is a solution, its centrally symmetrized version `1/2(K-K)` is also a solution with an equal or smaller area. For a centrally symmetric `K`, the condition of intersecting `px+qy=1` for all coprime integers `p,q` is equivalent to its support function `h_K(u)` being at least 1 for all primitive integer vectors `u=(p,q)`.\n\n2.  **Dual Problem and Key Theorems:** This problem can be analyzed in the \"dual\" space using the concept of a polar body `K*`. The condition on `K` implies that the interior of `K*` cannot contain any primitive integer lattice points. Two key theorems from convex geometry are crucial here:\n    *   A theorem based on Minkowski's work states that any origin-symmetric convex body in the plane with an area greater than 4 must contain a primitive integer point in its interior. This implies that the area of our polar body, `Area(K*)`, must be less than or equal to 4.\n    *   Mahler's theorem states that for any origin-symmetric convex body `K` in the plane, the product of its area and the area of its polar, `Area(K) * Area(K*)`, is at least 8.\n\n3.  **Finding the Minimum Area:** By combining these two theorems, we can find a lower bound for the area of `K`:\n    `Area(K) >= 8 / Area(K*)`.\n    Since `Area(K*) <= 4`, we have `Area(K) >= 8 / 4 = 2`.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Optimal Shape:** This minimum area of 2 is achieved if a shape `K` exists that turns both inequalities into equalities. This happens if `K` is a parallelogram (for which `Area(K)Area(K*)=8`) and its polar `K*` has an area of 4.\n    *   The square `K*` defined by `[-1, 1] x [-1, 1]` has an area of 4 and its interior contains no primitive integer points.\n    *   The polar of this square is the domain `K` defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| <= 1`. This shape is a diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees), which is a parallelogram.\n    *   This domain `K` meets the required condition (`h_K(p,q) = max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The final step is to calculate the area of this diamond-shaped domain `K`. The following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_minimal_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of the convex domain K defined by |x| + |y| <= 1.\n    This domain is the proven solution for the minimal area.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The minimal convex domain is described by the inequality: |x| + |y| <= 1\")\n    print(\"This shape is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\")\n    \n    # We can calculate the area by seeing it as a square with diagonals of length 2.\n    # The diagonals run from (-1,0) to (1,0) and from (0,-1) to (0,1).\n    d1 = 2\n    d2 = 2\n    area_from_diagonals = 0.5 * d1 * d2\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe area of a rhombus (like our rotated square) is (d1 * d2) / 2.\")\n    print(f\"The lengths of the diagonals are d1 = {d1} and d2 = {d2}.\")\n    print(f\"Area = (0.5 * {d1} * {d2}) = {area_from_diagonals}\")\n    \n    # Alternatively, we can calculate the side length and square it.\n    # The side length is the distance between (1,0) and (0,1).\n    side_length = math.sqrt((1-0)**2 + (0-1)**2)\n    area_from_side = side_length ** 2\n\n    print(\"\\nAlternatively, calculating from the side length:\")\n    # Using 'g' format specifier to handle floating point representation cleanly.\n    print(f\"Side length = sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2) = {side_length:g}\")\n    print(f\"Area = (side length)^2 = ({side_length:g})^2 = {area_from_side:.1f}\")\n\ncalculate_minimal_area()\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
