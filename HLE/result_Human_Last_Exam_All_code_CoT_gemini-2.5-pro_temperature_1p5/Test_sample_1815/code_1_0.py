        "4. By the problem's condition, since any sequence from H converges, it must be eventually constant.",
        
        "5. Subgroups of Z are of the form mZ for some integer m >= 0. If H = mZ for m > 0, H is infinite. The sequence (m, 2m, 3m, ...) is a sequence of distinct elements in H. This sequence is not eventually constant, which contradicts our finding from step 4.",

        "6. This means H cannot be an infinite subgroup. The only finite subgroup of Z is {0}. Therefore, H must be {0}.",

        "9. Let's show that any such topology must have a nontrivial convergent sequence. The completion of (Z, tau), call it A, is a compact, metrizable, Hausdorff group, and Z is a dense subgroup of A.",

        "10. Since tau is not discrete, A is an infinite compact metric space. Its identity element, e, cannot be isolated. So, there is a sequence (a_n) in A \\ {e} that converges to e.",

        "11. As Z is dense in A, for each n, we can find an integer x_n such that its image phi(x_n) in A is in a shrinking neighborhood of e, and phi(x_n) != e. This implies x_n != 0. The sequence (x_n) in Z converges to 0.",

        "12. This sequence (x_n) cannot be eventually constant. If it were eventually some constant c, then since it converges to 0 and the topology is Hausdorff, c must be 0. But this contradicts x_n != 0.",

        "13. So, (x_n) is a sequence that is not eventually constant and converges to 0. This is a nontrivial convergent sequence.",
        
        "14. The existence of such a sequence contradicts the initial condition. Therefore, no such topology tau can exist.",
