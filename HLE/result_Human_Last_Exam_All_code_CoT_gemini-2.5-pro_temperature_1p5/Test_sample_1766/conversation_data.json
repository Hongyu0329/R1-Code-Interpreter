    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1` and the spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum quantum number `j` can take values from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps. We will calculate these possible `j` values.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j)**: For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues**:\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $J^2$ are given by the formula `j(j + 1) * hbar^2`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $J_z$ are given by the formula `m_j * hbar`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: A Python script will be created to perform these calculations and print the results for each possible state `(j, m_j)`. The output will clearly display the state and the corresponding eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$, including the formula with the specific numbers plugged in.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital angular momentum l = {l} and spin s = {s}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(\"The possible states are:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Iterate through each possible j and its corresponding m_j values to find the eigenvalues\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue of J^2\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        # Determine the possible m_j values for the current j\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n\n        print(f\"For the state with total angular momentum quantum number j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Print J^2 eigenvalue calculation\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1) * hbar^2\")\n        print(f\"  = ({j}) * ({j} + 1) * hbar^2 = {j_squared_eigenvalue} * hbar^2\")\n        \n        # Iterate through m_j values and print J_z eigenvalue\n        print(f\"  The corresponding common eigenvalues of J_z are:\")\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            j_z_eigenvalue = m_j\n            print(f\"    For m_j = {m_j}, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = {j_z_eigenvalue} * hbar\")\n        \n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n<<<\nFor a p-electron with orbital angular momentum l = 1 and spin s = 0.5.\n\nThe possible states are:\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFor the state with total angular momentum quantum number j = 0.5:\n  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1) * hbar^2\n  = (0.5) * (0.5 + 1) * hbar^2 = 0.75 * hbar^2\n  The corresponding common eigenvalues of J_z are:\n    For m_j = -0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = -0.5 * hbar\n    For m_j = 0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = 0.5 * hbar\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFor the state with total angular momentum quantum number j = 1.5:\n  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1) * hbar^2\n  = (1.5) * (1.5 + 1) * hbar^2 = 3.75 * hbar^2\n  The corresponding common eigenvalues of J_z are:\n    For m_j = -1.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = -1.5 * hbar\n    For m_j = -0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = -0.5 * hbar\n    For m_j = 0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = 0.5 * hbar\n    For m_j = 1.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = 1.5 * hbar\n------------------------------------------------------------\n>>>"
