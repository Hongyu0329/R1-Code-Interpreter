For a p-electron with orbital angular momentum l = 1 and spin s = 0.5.

The possible states are:
------------------------------------------------------------
For the state with total angular momentum quantum number j = 0.5:
  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1) * hbar^2
  = (0.5) * (0.5 + 1) * hbar^2 = 0.75 * hbar^2
  The corresponding common eigenvalues of J_z are:
    For m_j = -0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = -0.5 * hbar
    For m_j = 0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = 0.5 * hbar
------------------------------------------------------------
For the state with total angular momentum quantum number j = 1.5:
  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1) * hbar^2
  = (1.5) * (1.5 + 1) * hbar^2 = 3.75 * hbar^2
  The corresponding common eigenvalues of J_z are:
    For m_j = -1.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = -1.5 * hbar
    For m_j = -0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = -0.5 * hbar
    For m_j = 0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = 0.5 * hbar
    For m_j = 1.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar = 1.5 * hbar
