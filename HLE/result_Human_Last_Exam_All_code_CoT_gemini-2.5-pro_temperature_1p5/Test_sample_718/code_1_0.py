    # Step 1: Interpret the structure of an upper semilattice in categorical terms.
    # A partially ordered set (poset) 'J' can be viewed as a small category.
    # The condition that 'J' is an upper semilattice means that for any two objects x, y in J,
    # their pushout exists (it is their join, or least upper bound).

    # Step 2: State the relevant theorem from homological algebra.
    # A theorem by L. Gruson states that if a small category 'C' has all pushouts, then
    # the global dimension of the category of functors from C to vector spaces, Func(C, Vect_K),
    # is at most 2.
    # In symbols: gl.dim(Func(C, Vect_K)) <= 2

    # Step 3: Apply the theorem to the specific case of the poset J.
    # Since J is an upper semilattice, the category J has pushouts.
    # Therefore, the global dimension of Func(J, Vect_K) is at most 2.

    # Step 4: Relate global dimension to n-resolvability.
    # A functor 'f' is n-resolvable if its projective dimension, pd(f), is at most n.
    # The global dimension of a category is the maximum projective dimension of any object within it.
    # Since gl.dim(Func(J, Vect_K)) <= 2, it follows that for any functor f: J -> Vect_K,
    # we have pd(f) <= 2.
    # This result holds for all functors, including those described as "tame".

    # Step 5: Conclude the value of n.
    n = 2
