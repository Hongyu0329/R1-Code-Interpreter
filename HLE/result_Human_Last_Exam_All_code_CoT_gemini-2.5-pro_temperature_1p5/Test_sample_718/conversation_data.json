    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: The user is asking for the value of `n` such that a \"tame functor\" `f` from an \"upper semilattice\" `J` to the category of vector spaces `Vect_K` is \"n-resolvable\".\n\n2.  **Interpret the Terms**:\n    *   **n-resolvable**: In homological algebra, a module or functor `f` is `n`-resolvable if there exists a projective resolution of `f` of length `n`. This means that the projective dimension of `f`, denoted `pd(f)`, is less than or equal to `n`. The question asks for a universal value of `n` that works for any such `f` and `J`.\n    *   **Upper Semilattice (J)**: A partially ordered set where every pair of elements `{x, y}` has a least upper bound (a join), denoted `x \\/ y`.\n    *   **Categorical Interpretation**: A poset can be viewed as a small category where objects are the elements of the poset and there is a unique morphism from `x` to `y` if and only if `x \\le y`. The condition that `J` is an upper semilattice is equivalent to the categorical property that the category `J` has all pushouts.\n    *   **Tame Functor**: This term is potentially ambiguous. It could refer to a functor in a category of tame representation type. A key insight is that finite upper semilattices are always of tame (or finite) representation type, so this condition might be redundant. The solution should ideally hold for *any* functor on `J`.\n\n3.  **Apply a Key Theorem**: There is a fundamental theorem in the homological algebra of functor categories, originally due to L. Gruson. It states that if a small category `C` has all pushouts, then the global dimension of the functor category `Func(C, Vect_K)` is at most 2.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Solve**:\n    *   Since `J` is an upper semilattice, the category `J` has pushouts.\n    *   Applying Gruson's theorem, the global dimension of `Func(J, Vect_K)` is at most 2.\n    *   The global dimension is the maximum projective dimension of any functor in the category. Therefore, for any functor `f: J -> Vect_K`, we have `pd(f) <= 2`.\n    *   This means that any such functor `f` (whether it's called \"tame\" or not) is 2-resolvable.\n    *   Thus, the answer is `n = 2`.\n\n5.  **Construct the Code**: I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final conclusion as an equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_resolvability():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the value 'n' for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.\n\n    The solution is based on a key result in the homological algebra of functor categories.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Interpret the structure of an upper semilattice in categorical terms.\n    # A partially ordered set (poset) 'J' can be viewed as a small category.\n    # The condition that 'J' is an upper semilattice means that for any two objects x, y in J,\n    # their pushout exists (it is their join, or least upper bound).\n\n    # Step 2: State the relevant theorem from homological algebra.\n    # A theorem by L.
