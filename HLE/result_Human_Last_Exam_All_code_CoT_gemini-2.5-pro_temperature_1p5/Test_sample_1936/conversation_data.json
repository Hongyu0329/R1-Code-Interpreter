    "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer `n` for which we can define a binary operation `.` on a set `G` of size `n` such that `(G, .)` is not a group.\n\nA group is a set `G` with a binary operation that must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, existence of an identity element, and existence of an inverse for every element. We will assume the standard definition that a group must be non-empty, so we will start our search from `n=1`.\n\nOur plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Start with `n=1` and check if it's possible for a set of this size to *not* be a group.\n2.  The script will systematically generate every possible binary operation for the set size `n`.\n3.  For each generated operation, it will check the group axioms (associativity, identity, inverse). Closure is guaranteed by how we define the operation.\n4.  If it finds an operation that fails any axiom, it will print the details of this counterexample and declare `n` as the answer.\n5.  If all possible operations for a given `n` result in a group, it will move on to `n+1`.\n\nThis programmatic approach will find the smallest `n` by construction.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the smallest integer n >= 1 such that there exists a set G of n\n    elements and a binary operation that is not a group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def check_group_axioms(n, table):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a given Cayley table of size n forms a group.\n        Returns (is_group, reason, details).\n        \"\"\"\n        elements = range(n)\n\n        # 1.
