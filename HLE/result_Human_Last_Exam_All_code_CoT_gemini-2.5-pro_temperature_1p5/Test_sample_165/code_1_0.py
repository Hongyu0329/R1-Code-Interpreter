    # Step 1: Analyze the properties of the operation.
    # Let Q(S) be the sum of the squares of the elements in a set S.
    # Q(S) = sum(s*s for s in S).
    
    # Step 2: Observe how Q(S) changes.
    # When we replace x and y with x+y and x-y:
    # Q_new = Q_old - x^2 - y^2 + (x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2
    # Q_new = Q_old - x^2 - y^2 + (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2)
    # Q_new = Q_old + x^2 + y^2

    # Step 3: Use this property to determine reachability.
    # The initial set S_0 has n > 1 distinct integers. This means at least one
    # element is non-zero, so the initial sum of squares Q_0 is strictly positive.
    # The operation always increases the sum of squares, unless x=0 and y=0.
    # The target state S_final = {0, 0, ..., 0} has a sum of squares Q_final = 0.
    # Since Q starts at a positive value and can only increase, it can never reach 0.
    # Therefore, it is impossible for ANY valid initial set S to reach the all-zero state.

    # Step 4: Count the number of impossible sets.
    # This means the number of impossible sets is the total number of possible initial sets.
    # An initial set S is formed by choosing n distinct integers from the range [-k, k].
    # The number of integers in [-k, k] is k - (-k) + 1 = 2k + 1.
    # The number of ways to choose n distinct integers is C(2k + 1, n).
