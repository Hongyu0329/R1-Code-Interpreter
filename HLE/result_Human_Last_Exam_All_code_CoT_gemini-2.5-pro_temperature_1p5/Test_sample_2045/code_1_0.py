# 2. Consequence of the lesion:
# The right brain processes the left visual field.
# The main optic radiation (not Meyer's loop) processes the inferior visual field.
# Therefore, the lesion causes blindness in the lower left visual field.

# 3. Observed Behavior:
# The primate accurately reaches for a stimulus in the lower left quadrant.
# This shows unconscious visual processing of the target's location.
action = "Accurate reaching"

# The primate simultaneously signals that it sees no stimulus.
# This shows a lack of conscious perception.

# 4. Definition of Blindsight:
# Blindsight is the ability to respond to visual stimuli without conscious awareness.

# 5. Conclusion:
# The primate demonstrates the ability to react to a stimulus in its blind spot
# (the lower left quadrant) while reporting that it does not see it.
