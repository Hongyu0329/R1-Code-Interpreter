    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Sequence**: The problem describes a sequence `a(n)` representing the number of certain Feynman diagrams. I'll identify this sequence using known mathematical and physics resources. This corresponds to sequence A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n2.  **Find the Recurrence Relation**: The OEIS entry for A005411 provides a recurrence relation to calculate the terms of the sequence. The formula is:\n    `a(n) = (2n-1)!! - Î£ [a(k) * (2(n-k)-1)!!]` for k from 1 to n-1.\n    The sequence starts with `a(0) = 1`, and `(2n-1)!!` is the double factorial (e.g., `5!! = 5 * 3 * 1`).\n3.  **Plan the Calculation**: To find `a(3)`, we need the values of `a(0)`, `a(1)`, and `a(2)`.\n    *   `a(0) = 1` (by definition)\n    *   `a(1)` can be calculated using `a(0)`.\n    *   `a(2)` can be calculated using `a(0)` and `a(1)`.\n    *   `a(3)` can be calculated using `a(0)`, `a(1)`, and `a(2)`.\n4.  **Write the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Implements a function for the double factorial.\n    *   Calculates `a(1)` and `a(2)` as intermediate steps.\n    *   Uses these values to calculate `a(3)`.\n    *   Prints the final equation showing how `a(3)` is derived from the previous terms, including all the numerical values involved in the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef double_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the double factorial n!!.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Double factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n    if n == 0 or n == -1:\n        # By convention, 0!! = 1 and (-1)!! = 1\n        return 1\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(n, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\n# The sequence a(n) is for the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\n# of order 2n. We want to find a(3).\n# The recurrence relation is:\n# a(n) = (2n-1)!! - sum_{k=1..n-1} a(k) * (2(n-k)-1)!!\n# The base case is a(0) = 1.\n\n# Store computed values of a(n)\na = {}\n\n# a(0) is the base case\na[0] = 1\n\n# Calculate a(1)\n# a(1) = (2*1-1)!! = 1!!\na[1] = double_factorial(1)\n\n# Calculate a(2)\n# a(2) = (2*2-1)!! - a(1) * (2*(2-1)-1)!!\n# a(2) = 3!! - a(1) * 1!!\na[2] = double_factorial(3) - (a[1] * double_factorial(1))\n\n# Now, calculate a(3) using the previously computed values\n# a(3) = (2*3-1)!! - [a(1)*(2*(3-1)-1)!! + a(2)*(2*(3-2)-1)!!]\n# a(3) = 5!! - [a(1)*3!! + a(2)*1!!]\ndf5 = double_factorial(5)\ndf3 = double_factorial(3)\ndf1 = double_factorial(1)\nterm1 = a[1] * df3\nterm2 = a[2] * df1\na[3] = df5 - (term1 + term2)\n\n# Print the final equation with all numbers filled in.\nprint(f\"To find a(3), we first need a(1) and a(2):\")\nprint(f\"a(1) = 1!! = {a[1]}\")\nprint(f\"a(2) = 3!! - (a(1) * 1!!) = {df3} - ({a[1]} * {df1}) = {a[2]}\")\nprint(\"\\nNow we can calculate a(3):\")\nprint(f\"a(3) = 5!! - (a(1) * 3!! + a(2) * 1!!)\")\nprint(f\"a(3) = {df5} - ({a[1]} * {df3} + {a[2]} * {df1})\")\nprint(f\"a(3) = {df5} - ({term1} + {term2})\")\nprint(f\"a(3) = {df5} - {term1 + term2}\")\nprint(f\"a(3) = {a[3]}\")\n\n```\n<<<10>>>"
