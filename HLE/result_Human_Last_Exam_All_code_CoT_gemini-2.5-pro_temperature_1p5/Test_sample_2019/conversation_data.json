    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to find the total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n2.  **Define Toroidal Chessboard Rules:**\n    *   A 5x5 board has 25 squares.\n    *   \"Toroidal\" means the board wraps around on its edges. A queen moving off the right edge reappears on the left, and a queen moving off the bottom edge reappears on the top.\n    *   A queen at position `(r, c)` attacks any square `(qr, qc)` if they share a row, column, or a wrapped diagonal.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Attack Conditions Mathematically:**\n    For any two queens at `(r, c)` and `(qr, qc)` on an N x N toroidal board (here N=5), they attack each other if any of these conditions are true:\n    *   **Row Attack:** `r == qr`\n    *   **Column Attack:** `c == qc`\n    *   **Main Diagonal Attack:** `(r - c) % N == (qr - qc) % N`\n    *   **Anti-Diagonal Attack:** `(r + c) % N == (qr + qc) % N`\n\n4.  **Choose the Right Algorithm:**\n    The problem is a classic combinatorial search problem. The total number of ways to place 4 queens on 25 squares is `C(25, 4) = 12,650`, which is small enough to be solved computationally. I will use a **backtracking algorithm**.\n\n5.  **Algorithm Outline:**\n    *   I will write a recursive function that attempts to place queens one by one.\n    *   The function will explore placing a queen on each of the 25 squares. To avoid duplicates (since the order of placement doesn't matter), I'll ensure that we only place queens on squares with a higher index than the previously placed queen.\n    *   For each potential placement, I'll check if it's \"safe\" (i.e., not attacked by any previously placed queens) using the toroidal rules defined above.\n    *   If the placement is safe, I'll proceed recursively to place the next queen.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when all 4 queens have been successfully placed. When this happens, I increment a counter for the number of valid solutions.\n    *   The final count will be the answer to the problem.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place K non-attacking queens on an\n    N x N toroidal chessboard using a backtracking algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5  # The size of the board (N x N)\n    K = 4  # The number of queens to place\n\n    def is_safe(r, c, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a queen at (r, c) is safe with respect to existing\n        placements on the toroidal board.\n        \"\"\"\n        for qr, qc in placements:\n            # Check for row or column attacks\n            if r == qr or c == qc:\n                return False\n\n            # Check for toroidal diagonal attacks.\n            # (a % N + N) % N is a robust way to compute a modulo n \n            # for both positive and negative a.\n            if ((r - c) % N + N) % N == ((qr - qc) % N + N) % N:\n                return False\n            if (r + c) % N == (qr + qc) % N:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def count_placements_recursive(queens_to_place, start_index, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively finds the number of valid ways to place the remaining queens.\n\n        :param queens_to_place: The number of queens yet to be placed.\n        :param start_index: The board square index (0-24) to start searching from.\n                            This avoids counting permutations of the same placement.\n        :param placements: A list of (row, col) tuples for queens already on the board.\n        :return: The number of valid placements found from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If all K queens have been placed, we found one valid solution.\n        if queens_to_place == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Iterate through squares, starting from 'start_index' to find a valid\n        # spot for the next queen.\n        for i in range(start_index, N * N):\n            r = i // N\n            c = i % N\n\n            # If it's safe to place a queen here...\n            if is_safe(r, c, placements):\n                # ...place it and recurse to find placements for the rest of the queens.\n                new_placements = placements + [(r, c)]\n                count += count_placements_recursive(queens_to_place - 1, i + 1, new_placements)\n        \n        return count\n\n    # Start the calculation\n    total_ways = count_placements_recursive(K, 0, [])\n\n    # The problem asks to \"output each number in the final equation!\". \n    # Since the answer is a single number, this is the final result of our calculation.\n    print(total_ways)\n\n\nsolve_n_queens_toroidal()\n```\n<<<300>>>"
