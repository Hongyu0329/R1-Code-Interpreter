    "Of course. I will provide a step-by-step derivation for the partition function Z of the given system.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will start with the general definition of the grand canonical partition function, `Z = Tr[exp(-β(H - μN))]`.\n2.  I will substitute the specific Hamiltonian you provided, `H = -μN`, and simplify the expression inside the trace.\n3.  The calculation of the trace depends on the statistics of the particles in the system (whether they are bosons or fermions). I will evaluate the partition function for both cases, considering a single quantum state that can be occupied.\n4.  Finally, I will briefly explain how this result connects to the path integral formalism by stating the corresponding action `S`.\n\nThe Python code below will print this derivation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z\n    for a system with Hamiltonian H = -μN in the grand canonical ensemble.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Derivation of the Partition Function Z\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Definition of the Grand Canonical Partition Function\n    print(\"Step 1: The grand canonical partition function Z is defined as a trace over the system's states:\")\n    print(\"Z = Tr[exp(-β * (H - μ*N))]\")\n    print(\"Here, β is the inverse temperature, μ is the chemical potential, H is the Hamiltonian, and N is the number operator.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Substitute the given Hamiltonian\n    print(\"Step 2: Substitute the given Hamiltonian H = -μ*N into the formula.\")\n    print(\"Z = Tr[exp(-β * ((-μ*N) - μ*N))]\")\n    print(\"This simplifies the term in the exponent:\\n\")\n    print(\"-β * (-μ*N - μ*N) = -β * (-2*μ*N) = 2*β*μ*N\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Simplified expression for Z\n    print(\"Step 3: The expression for Z becomes:\")\n    print(\"Z = Tr[exp(2*β*μ*N)]\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Evaluate the Trace\n    print(\"Step 4: The trace is evaluated by summing over a basis of states.
