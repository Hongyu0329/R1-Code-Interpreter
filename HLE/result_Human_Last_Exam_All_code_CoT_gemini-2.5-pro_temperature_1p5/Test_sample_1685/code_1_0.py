# Step 1: Set up the equation for the coefficient A based on the dominant balance analysis.
# The homogeneous ODE for large x is y''' approx y^4 + (y')^4.
# Assuming a solution of the form y(x) = A * x^n, we found n = -1.
# The coefficient equation is n*(n-1)*(n-2)*A = A^4.
# For n = -1, this simplifies to -6*A = A^4, which for A != 0 gives A^3 = -6.

# Step 2: Calculate the value of A.
# A is the real cube root of -6.
A_cubed = -6.0
A = math.copysign(pow(abs(A_cubed), 1/3), A_cubed)

# Step 3: Round the coefficient to two decimal places as requested.
A_rounded = round(A, 2)

# Step 4: Formulate and print the final analytical expression.
# The expression is y(x) = A / x.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
numerator = A_rounded
denominator_power = 1

# So I'll just print the equation string inside the desired format. Let's make it more specific as required by the prompt's last instruction.
