def solve_visual_pathway_puzzle():
    """
    Analyzes potential information pathways in the monkey visual system to find the impossible route.

    The analysis is based on established neuroanatomical principles:
    1.  **Main Hierarchy:** The general flow in the ventral "what" pathway is posterior-to-anterior,
        from the occipital lobe to the temporal lobe. A simplified core path is V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> TEO -> TE.
    2.  **Anatomical Position:** Area TEO is the posterior inferotemporal cortex, while TE is the anterior
        inferotemporal cortex. Information flows FROM TEO TO TE. VTF (Ventral Temporal Fissure) is also an
        inferotemporal cortex area, generally considered at a stage after V4 and alongside or after TEO.
    3.  **Parallel Pathways:** Bypassing areas is possible (e.g., V1 can project to V3, skipping V2).
    4.  **Feedback Loops:** Connections are often bidirectional, allowing for loops (e.g., V4 -> V3 -> V4).

    The script will evaluate each choice against these rules to find the one that violates the fundamental
    posterior-to-anterior anatomical hierarchy.
