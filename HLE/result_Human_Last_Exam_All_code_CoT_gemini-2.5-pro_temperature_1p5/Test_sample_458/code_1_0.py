# The task is to identify dragonfly species from a list that are expected to have reduced pterostigmata based on their ecology.
# The key ecological trait linked to reduced pterostigmata is a highly specialized gliding flight, typical of long-distance migratory dragonflies in the tribe Pantalini.

# Species with this ecology from the list:
# 4) Pantala flavescens (Globe Skimmer): The archetypal migratory glider with a known reduced pterostigma.
# 10) Tholymis tillarga (Coral-tailed Cloudwing): Another member of the Pantalini tribe, also a migratory glider with a reduced pterostigma.

# The other species, while some are migratory, do not fit this specific "glider" profile and possess normal-sized pterostigmata for flutter damping in their respective flight styles.

# The final answer consists of the indices of the identified species.
