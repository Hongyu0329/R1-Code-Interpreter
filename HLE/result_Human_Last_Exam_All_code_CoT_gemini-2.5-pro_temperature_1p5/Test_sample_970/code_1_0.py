    This function determines the necessary assumptions for a Bayesian agent's
    expected information gain to approach zero and formats the answer in
    Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The problem asks for assumptions that guarantee the expected information gain (EIG) for a Bayesian agent converges to zero almost surely.
    2.  Assumption (a), finite prior entropy, is sufficient. The total expected information gain is bounded by the prior entropy. If this is finite, the sum of EIGs converges, which implies the terms must go to zero.
    3.  Assumption (c), convergence of the state occupancy distribution, is also sufficient. If the agent's behavior stabilizes, it effectively observes a stationary data stream. Bayesian learning converges on such streams, causing the EIG to go to zero, even if the total prior entropy is infinite (by restricting learning to a subset of the model).
    4.  Since either (a) or (c) is sufficient on its own, their disjunction (a OR c) is a sufficient condition.
    5.  This condition is also necessary. If both are false (infinite entropy AND a perpetually novelty-seeking policy), it is possible to construct counterexamples where the EIG does not converge to zero.
    6.  Therefore, the necessary assumption is (a OR c).
    7.  This is formatted in CNF as [(a OR c)].
