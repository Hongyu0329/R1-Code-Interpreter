    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: I will first determine the degree of unsaturation from the molecular formula $C_7H_{14}$ to know if the compound contains double bonds or rings.\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**: I will examine the number of signals, the chemical shifts (ppm), and the multiplicities (s, t, d, q) provided.\n    *   The chemical shifts indicate the electronic environment of the carbons (e.g., alkene, alkane).\n    *   The multiplicities (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling) tell us the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon: s = quaternary C, d = CH, t = CH2, q = CH3.\n    *   I will note that there are 6 signals for 7 carbons, which implies that two carbons are chemically equivalent.\n3.  **Identify Molecular Fragments**: I will translate each NMR signal into a specific structural fragment (e.g., 112(t) -> vinylic CH2 group, `=CH2`).\n4.  **Determine the Overlapping Signal**: By comparing the total hydrogen count from the unique signals to the molecular formula, I will determine which signal must correspond to the two equivalent carbons.\n5.  **Assemble the Structure**: I will piece together the fragments to form a complete, valid chemical structure. I'll need to make sure the connectivity results in the observed chemical equivalency. I will test possible isomers and eliminate those that do not match the data (for example, by having the wrong number of signals due to chirality).\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: Once the correct structure is determined, I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name the compound.\n7.  **Generate the Final Output**: I will write a Python script that prints this reasoning step-by-step and then provides the final IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided chemical data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"Determining the structure of C7H14 from its 13C NMR spectrum.\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(\"The molecular formula is C7H14.\")\n    print(\"This follows the general formula C(n)H(2n), which indicates one degree of unsaturation.\")\n    print(\"This means the compound must contain either one double bond (an alkene) or one ring (a cycloalkane).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(\"The 13C NMR data is: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\")\n    print(\" - There are 6 distinct signals for 7 carbons, so one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons.\")\n    print(\" - The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm), confirming the compound is an alkene.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Identify Molecular Fragments ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Translating NMR data into molecular fragments\")\n    print(\"Let's break down each signal based on its shift and multiplicity (s=C, d=CH, t=CH2, q=CH3):\")\n    print(\" - 145(s): A quaternary (s) carbon in the alkene region.
