    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Γ), we can analyze the possible structures of the corresponding quotient groups. A subgroup of index 4 leads to a group action on 4 elements. The image of this action must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group S₄. Since the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group (every element has an order that is a power of 2), the image of any homomorphism from it must also be a 2-group.\n\nThe transitive 2-subgroups of S₄ are:\n1.  The Klein four-group, V₄ (isomorphic to ℤ₂ × ℤ₂).\n2.  The dihedral group of order 8, D₄.\n\nWe can count the number of subgroups corresponding to each case.\n\n**Case 1: The action's image is V₄**\nThis corresponds to subgroups H where Γ/core(H) ≅ V₄. An action by V₄ on 4 elements is regular, meaning the point stabilizer is trivial. Thus, H = core(H), which implies that H must be a normal subgroup of index 4. A normal subgroup of index 4 gives a quotient group of order 4. Since the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is Γ_ab ≅ (ℤ₂)³, any abelian quotient of order 4 must be isomorphic to V₄. The number of such normal subgroups is equal to the number of subgroups of index 4 in Γ_ab. This is equivalent to finding the number of subgroups of order 8/4 = 2 in (ℤ₂)³. A subgroup of order 2 is generated by an element of order 2. There are 2³ - 1 = 7 non-identity elements in (ℤ₂)³, all of order 2. Each generates a distinct subgroup. Thus, there are 7 such subgroups.\n\n**Case 2: The action's image is D₄**\nThis corresponds to subgroups H where Γ/core(H) ≅ D₄. It is a known property that the Grigorchuk group has a unique normal subgroup N such that Γ/N ≅ D₄. For any subgroup H in this case, its core must be this unique normal subgroup N. The subgroup H itself corresponds to a point stabilizer in the action of D₄ on 4 elements. This action is the standard action on the vertices of a square. The stabilizer of a vertex is a non-normal subgroup of order |D₄|/4 = 2. The group D₄ has exactly 4 such non-normal subgroups of order 2. Therefore, there are 4 subgroups of this type.\n\nThese two cases are mutually exclusive because the subgroups in Case 1 are normal, while the subgroups in Case 2 are not. The total count is the sum of the numbers from both cases.\n\nThe following Python code performs the calculation based on this plan.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n# The calculation is based on group-theoretic properties of this group.\n\n# Case 1: Subgroups corresponding to an action with image V_4 (Klein four-group).\n# This is equivalent to the number of normal subgroups of index 4.\n# This equals the number of subgroups of order 2 in the abelianization (Z/2Z)^3.\nnum_elements = 2**3\n# Every non-identity element has order 2 and generates a unique subgroup of order 2.\nnum_normal_subgroups = num_elements - 1\nprint(f\"Number of normal subgroups of index 4 (V_4 type): {num_normal_subgroups}\")\n\n# Case 2: Subgroups corresponding to an action with image D_4 (dihedral group of order 8).\n# This equals the number of non-normal subgroups of order 2 in D_4, as there is a unique D_4 quotient of the Grigorchuk group.\n# D_4 has 5 elements of order 2. One generates the center (a normal subgroup), and 4 generate non-normal subgroups.\nnum_non_normal_subgroups = 4\nprint(f\"Number of non-normal subgroups of index 4 (D_4 type): {num_non_normal_subgroups}\")\n\n# The total number is the sum of the two disjoint cases.\ntotal = num_normal_subgroups + num_non_normal_subgroups\n\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of these two cases:\")\nprint(f\"{num_normal_subgroups} + {num_non_normal_subgroups} = {total}\")\n```\n<<<11>>>"
