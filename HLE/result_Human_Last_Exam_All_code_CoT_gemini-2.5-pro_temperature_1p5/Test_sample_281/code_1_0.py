# Set up a coordinate system to describe the drawing process.
# The first ruled line is at y=0, and lines descend into negative y values.
# The leftmost line is at x=0.
# The description implies "1 inch" is equal to "3 ruled line spaces" to form a square, so we'll use a 3x3 coordinate space for the main body.
