# Based on the analysis of the properties of chromatic and orbital chromatic roots,
# the true statements from the given list are A, B, and D.

# A. True: This is the Cameron-Jackson Theorem.
# B. True: Chromatic polynomials can have non-real complex roots (e.g., K_3,3).
# C. False: The alternating signs of the coefficients of a chromatic polynomial prevent any negative roots.
# D. True: W. T. Tutte showed that non-integer values like the square of the golden ratio can be chromatic roots.
# E. False: It is a known theorem that chromatic polynomials have no roots in the interval (0, 1).

# The final answer is the sorted string of the true statements' labels.
