# The minimal possible area is the area of an equilateral triangle
# with a height of 1/2.
# Let h be the height.
h = 0.5

# The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated from its height
# using the formula: Area = h^2 / sqrt(3).
# Another way is to first calculate the side length 'a'.
# a = (2 * h) / sqrt(3)
# And then use the area formula: Area = (1/2) * a * h.
# A simpler final expression for the area is sqrt(3) / 12.

numerator = math.sqrt(3)
denominator = 12.0
area = numerator / denominator
