    This function counts the number of 2-bridge knots with a crossing number
    of at most 13 that are also composite knots.

    Based on mathematical theorems:
    1. A knot has two disjoint, non-parallel, minimal genus Seifert surfaces
       if and only if it is a composite knot.
    2. All 2-bridge knots are prime knots.
    A knot cannot be both prime and composite. Thus, the expected number is 0.
