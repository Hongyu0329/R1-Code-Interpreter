    "This is a fascinating question that lies at the intersection of number theory, harmonic analysis, and fractal geometry. To determine the answer, we need to understand the key concepts and combine known mathematical results.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define a Sidon Set:** First, I'll clarify the definition of a Sidon set as it applies to real numbers, not just integers.\n2.  **Explain Hausdorff Dimension:** I'll briefly describe what Hausdorff dimension represents.\n3.  **State the Known Bounds:** I will cite the established mathematical results concerning the Hausdorff dimension of Sidon sets. This involves two parts: a classical upper bound and a more recent result confirming that this bound can be achieved.\n4.  **Synthesize the Answer:** Based on these results, I will state the final answer.\n5.  **Provide Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that programmatically prints out this explanation and the final result, satisfying the user's request for a coded solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hausdorff_dimension_of_sidon_set():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the maximum Hausdorff dimension\n    of a Sidon set in the real numbers between 0 and 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"--- The Maximum Hausdorff Dimension of a Sidon Set in [0, 1] ---\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1.
