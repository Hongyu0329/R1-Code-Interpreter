    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of irreducible representations and the total number of indecomposable representations for the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. The percentage will be the ratio of these two numbers.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object:** The question refers to the \"small\" quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, often denoted $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, with $q$ being a primitive third root of unity, which means the order $\\ell$ is 3. The category $C$ consists of all finite-dimensional indecomposable representations of this algebra.\n2.  **Count the irreducible representations:** I will determine the number of non-isomorphic simple (irreducible) modules for this algebra. The classification of simple modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at an $\\ell$-th root of unity is a standard result in representation theory.\n3.  **Count the total indecomposable representations:** I will determine the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. The representation type of the algebra (finite, tame, or wild) is crucial here. The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is of tame representation type, which informs the number of its indecomposable modules.\n4.  **Calculate the percentage:** With the two counts from the previous steps, I will calculate the percentage using the formula:\n    Percentage = (Number of Irreducible Objects / Total Number of Indecomposable Objects) * 100.\n\nThe code below will print out the numbers and the reasoning to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_representation_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of irreducible representations among all\n    indecomposable representations of u_q(sl_2) for q a primitive 3rd root of unity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The parameter 'q' is a primitive 3rd root of unity.\n    # In the theory of quantum groups at roots of unity, the key parameter is the\n    # smallest integer l > 1 such that q^l = 1.
