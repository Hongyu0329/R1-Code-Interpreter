    "My plan is to identify the numerical imprints for each of the specified capsules based on publicly available drug identification data. Then, I will write a Python script that stores these numbers in variables and prints them in a sentence to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\n# The imprint number for Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\nimprint_10mg = 3104\n\n# The imprint number for Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\nimprint_20mg = 3105\n\n# Print the different numbers found on the capsules.\nprint(f\"The different numbers imprinted on the capsules are {imprint_10mg} and {imprint_20mg}.\")\n\n```\n<<<The different numbers imprinted on the capsules are 3104 and 3105.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
