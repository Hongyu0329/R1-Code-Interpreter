Step 1: Define the 2D Atomic Model
- Electrons are spin-1/2 fermions, so each orbital holds 2 electrons.
- In 2D, the number of orbitals per subshell differs from 3D:
  - 's' subshell (l=0) is non-degenerate: 1 orbital, capacity = 1 * 2 = 2 electrons.
  - 'p','d','f',... subshells (l>0) are two-fold degenerate: 2 orbitals, capacity = 2 * 2 = 4 electrons.
- The electron filling order (Aufbau principle) is interpreted as filling by principal quantum number 'n', then by azimuthal quantum number 'l'.
  Order: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, ...
