    "The protein you are asking about is **CD33**.\n\nHere is a brief explanation of its role. CD33 is a type of protein known as an inhibitory receptor, which is found on the surface of immune cells in the brain called microglia. These microglia act as the brain's macrophages. The CD33 protein essentially acts as a \"brake\" or a \"don't eat me\" signal, dampening the microglia's ability to engulf and clear away cellular debris, including the amyloid-beta plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWhen the function of CD33 is inhibited, blocked by a drug, or the protein is absent (i.e., \"broken down\" in a functional sense), this braking signal is removed. This allows the microglia to become more active and effective at engulfing and clearing the amyloid plaques. Therefore, inhibiting CD33 is a key therapeutic strategy being explored for treating Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHere is a simple script to print this information.\n```python\ndef get_protein_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the protein whose inhibition\n    allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid plaques.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"CD33\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"The protein is CD33 (Siglec-3). It is an inhibitory receptor on microglia \"\n        \"(the brain's version of macrophages). When its function is 'broken down' or inhibited, \"\n        \"it removes a brake on the microglia's phagocytic (engulfing) activity, \"\n        \"thereby allowing for enhanced clearance of amyloid plaques.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Protein: {protein_name}\")\n    print(f\"Function: {explanation}\")\n\nget_protein_info()\n```\n<<<CD33>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
