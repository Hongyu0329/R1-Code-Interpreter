    "To find the number of real intersection points for the given plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of two quadratic equations with two variables, x and y.\n\nThe equations are:\n1) `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n2) `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nThese equations represent two conic sections, specifically ellipses, as their `B^2 - 4AC` discriminant is negative. The number of intersection points can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nA robust method to solve such a system is to eliminate one variable to obtain a single polynomial in the other variable. This can be achieved using resultants. By eliminating `y`, we get a polynomial in `x`. The real roots of this polynomial correspond to the x-coordinates of the intersection points. For each real `x`, we can then find the corresponding real `y`-coordinate(s).\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to carry out this procedure. It will:\n1.  Define the two equations as symbolic polynomials.\n2.  Compute the resultant of the two polynomials to eliminate the variable `y`.\n3.  Find the numerical real roots of the resulting polynomial in `x`.\n4.  For each real root of `x`, substitute it back into the original equations and solve for `y`.\n5.  Count the number of unique pairs `(x, y)` where both `x` and `y` are real numbers. This count gives the number of real intersection points.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef count_real_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of real intersection points between two quadrics.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y = sp.symbols('x y', real=True)\n\n    # The first equation: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    eq1_coeffs = [164, -216, 72, -16, 0, 31]\n    eq1 = eq1_coeffs[0]*x**2 + eq1_coeffs[1]*x*y + eq1_coeffs[2]*y**2 + eq1_coeffs[3]*x + eq1_coeffs[4]*y + eq1_coeffs[5]\n    print(\"Equation 1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\")\n\n    # The second equation: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n    eq2_coeffs = [864, -1056, 324, -560, 324, 149]\n    eq2 = eq2_coeffs[0]*x**2 + eq2_coeffs[1]*x*y + eq2_coeffs[2]*y**2 + eq2_coeffs[3]*x + eq2_coeffs[4]*y + eq2_coeffs[5]\n    print(\"Equation 2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\")\n\n    # Treat equations as polynomials in y to eliminate y\n    p1 = sp.Poly(eq1, y)\n    p2 = sp.Poly(eq2, y)\n\n    # Compute the resultant to eliminate y\n    res = sp.resultant(p1, p2)\n    \n    # Find the real roots of the resultant polynomial in x numerically\n    # We use a high precision for nroots and a small threshold for checking if imaginary part is zero\n    x_roots = [r for r in sp.nroots(res, n=30) if abs(sp.im(r)) < 1e-20]\n    \n    real_solutions = []\n    # Tolerance for checking if two solutions are the same\n    tol = 1e-9\n\n    # For each real x, solve for y and check if the solution is consistent\n    for x_val in x_roots:\n        # Substitute x_val into both equations\n        eq1_at_x = eq1.subs(x, x_val)\n        eq2_at_x = eq2.subs(x, x_val)\n        \n        # Find real roots for y from the first equation\n        y_sols1 = [r for r in sp.nroots(eq1_at_x, n=30) if abs(sp.im(r)) < 1e-20]\n        \n        # Check which of these y values also satisfy the second equation\n        for y_val in y_sols1:\n            # Check if y_val satisfies the second equation within a small tolerance\n            if abs(eq2_at_x.subs(y, y_val)) < 1e-9:\n                # Check if this solution is new\n                is_new = True\n                for sol_x, sol_y in real_solutions:\n                    if abs(sol_x - x_val) < tol and abs(sol_y - y_val) < tol:\n                        is_new = False\n                        break\n                if is_new:\n                    real_solutions.append((x_val, y_val))\n\n    num_real_intersections = len(real_solutions)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe number of real intersection points is: {num_real_intersections}\")\n\ncount_real_intersections()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
