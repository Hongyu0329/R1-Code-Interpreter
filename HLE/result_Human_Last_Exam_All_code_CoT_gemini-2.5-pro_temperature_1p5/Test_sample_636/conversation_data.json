    "To find the state feedback gain `F` that places the eigenvalues of `A + BF` at the desired locations, we will follow the pole placement procedure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define System and Targets:** We'll start by defining the system matrices `A` and `B`, and the desired eigenvalues (`-1 + j` and `-1 - j`) in a Python script using the `numpy` library.\n2.  **Determine Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial. For a 2x2 system with eigenvalues `λ1` and `λ2`, this polynomial is `(s - λ1)(s - λ2) = s^2 - (λ1 + λ2)s + (λ1 * λ2) = 0`. For the desired eigenvalues `-1 ± j`, the sum is `-2` and the product is `2`. Thus, the target characteristic polynomial is `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n3.  **Formulate Closed-Loop System Polynomial:** We'll define the feedback gain matrix `F` with unknown elements `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`. Then, we'll form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`. The characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` will be `s^2 - trace(A_cl)s + det(A_cl) = 0`. The trace and determinant will be expressions containing the unknown elements of `F`.\n4.  **Set up and Solve Equations:** By equating the coefficients of the closed-loop polynomial with those of our target polynomial, we get a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`).\n    - `-(trace(A_cl)) = 2`\n    - `det(A_cl) = 2`\nSince this system is underdetermined (infinite solutions), we can simplify it by choosing values for two of the variables. We'll set `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This will leave us with a system of two linear equations in `f1` and `f2`, which we can solve.\n5.  **Construct and Verify:** Once we find the values for `f1` and `f2`, we will construct the full matrix `F`. The script will then print the resulting `F`. As a final check, it will compute the eigenvalues of the final closed-loop system `A + BF` to confirm they are at the desired locations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set print options for better readability\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)\n\n# 1.

Simplify by setting f3=0 and f4=0. The system of equations becomes:\n# f1 + f2 = -1\n# -f1 - 2*f2 = 3\n# We can write this as M * x = v, where x = [f1, f2]\nM = np.array([[1., 1.], \n              [-1., -2.]])\nv = np.array([-1., 3.])\n\n# 4.
