    "An elegant explanation of your method to solve the problem, followed by the complete code.\n\nThe user wants to find the values of `λ` for which the following integral equation has no solution:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel `K(x,y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it can be expanded into a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`: `K(x, y) = Σₖ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ yᵏ`.\n\nThe structure of the equation implies that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. By substituting a generic polynomial `u(x) = a₀ + a₁x + ... + aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹` into the equation and equating the coefficients for each power of `x`, the problem can be transformed into a system of `n` linear equations. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n\n`(I - λM)a = f`\n\nwhere `a` is the vector of the polynomial coefficients `[a₀, ..., aₙ₋₁]`, `f` is a constant vector `[1, 0, ..., 0]`, and `M` is an `n x n` matrix whose entries are constants derived from the integral operator.\n\nThe system fails to have a unique solution when its determinant is zero, i.e., `det(I - λM) = 0`. This condition gives a polynomial equation in `λ`. The roots of this polynomial are the characteristic values of `λ`. For these values, the system is generally inconsistent, meaning there is no solution for the coefficients `a`, and thus no solution `u(x)` for the original integral equation.\n\nSince the integer `n` is not specified in the problem, I will solve for the smallest non-trivial case, `n=2`. For this case, the kernel is `K(x,y) = x+y`. I will use Python with the `sympy` library to symbolically construct the matrix `M` for `n=2`, derive the polynomial equation for `λ`, and find its roots. These roots are the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution.\n\nThe final code will print the derived polynomial equation and then its solutions.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution,\n    for a specific integer n.\n\n    The method involves converting the integral equation into a system of linear equations\n    of the form (I - lambda*M)a = f.
