# Step 1: Identify the opera based on the Marietta Alboni clue.
opera_title = "La Favorite"
alboni_performance_year = 1843

# Step 2: Identify the year of the relevant Enrico Caruso performance.
caruso_performance_year = 1905

# Step 3: Calculate the minimum year for the new revival based on the time gap.
time_gap = 70
revival_minimum_year = caruso_performance_year + time_gap

# Step 4: Identify the actual NYC revival that fits the criteria.
# The New York City Opera staged a famous revival of "La Favorite" in 1978,
# which is the first major production after the calculated minimum year of 1975.
nyc_revival_year = 1978

# Step 5: Identify the bass singer from the 1978 New York City Opera production.
# The principal bass role in "La Favorite" is Baldassarre.
bass_role = "Baldassarre"
bass_singer = "James Morris"

# Print the final conclusion
