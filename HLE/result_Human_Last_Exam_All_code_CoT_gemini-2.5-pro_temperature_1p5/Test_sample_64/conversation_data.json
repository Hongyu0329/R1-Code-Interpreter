    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otōto), we can consult a Japanese pitch accent dictionary. I will write a Python script that simulates looking up this word in such a dictionary and explains the resulting pattern.\n\nThe standard accent for 「弟」 is Heiban (平板), which is represented numerically as [0]. In this pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), and then stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates this lookup:\n\n```python\ndef get_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple dictionary to store and retrieve pitch accent information.\n    Accent patterns are represented numerically:\n    [0] -> Heiban (平板): Low-High-High...\n    [1] -> Atamadaka (頭高): High-Low-Low...\n    [n] -> Nakadaka (中高) or Odaka (尾高): Accent on the nth mora.\n    \"\"\"\n    accent_database = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"reading\": \"おとうと\",\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Heiban\",\n            \"pattern_number\": 0,\n            \"morae_count\": 4,\n            \"explanation\": \"The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and remains high.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    if word in accent_database:\n        info = accent_database[word]\n        print(f\"Word: 「{word}」\")\n        print(f\"Reading: {info['reading']}\")\n        print(f\"Pattern Name: {info['pattern_name']}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n        print(\"Pitch accent can be represented numerically by the position of the accent kernel.\")\n        print(\"For Heiban, the accent kernel is on position 0, meaning there is no downstep in pitch within the word.\")\n        print(f\"Numerical Pattern: [{info['pattern_number']}]\")\n        print(\"\\nPronunciation Pattern (L = Low, H = High):\")\n        print(\"Mora 1 (お): L\")\n        print(\"Mora 2 (と): H\")\n        print(\"Mora 3 (う): H\")\n        print(\"Mora 4 (と): H\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Pitch accent for '{word}' not found.\")\n\n# Find the pitch accent for 「弟」\nget_pitch_accent(\"弟\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
