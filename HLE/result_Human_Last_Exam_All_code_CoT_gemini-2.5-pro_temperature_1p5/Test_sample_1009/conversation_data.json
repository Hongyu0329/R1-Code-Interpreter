    "Of course, I can help you with this question. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nI will determine the largest possible weight by analyzing the structure of the topological group $G$. The key insight is to consider the quotient group $K = G/H$, where $H$ is the closure of the identity element, $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. This quotient group $K$ is Hausdorff, even though $G$ may not be. The properties of $G$ being compact and first-countable are inherited by $K$, which places strong constraints on $K$. By using well-known theorems from the theory of topological groups, I will find an upper bound for the weight of $G$. Then, I will show that this upper bound is achievable by constructing a group that meets all the specified conditions.\n\nThe final calculation will be presented within a Python script, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_weight():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides a step-by-step derivation for the largest possible weight\n    of a compact, first-countable topological group G of cardinality 2^(2^c).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define Cardinals ---\n    # We use string representations for the relevant infinite cardinal numbers.\n    aleph_0 = \"aleph_0\"\n    c = \"c\" # The cardinality of the continuum, 2^aleph_0.\n\n    # --- Problem Statement ---\n    card_G = f\"2^(2^{c})\"\n    print(\"Problem parameters:\")\n    print(f\"1.
