    Analyzes the relationship between orbital overlap and covalency to determine

    # Introduction to the key principle
    principle = "In chemical bonding, covalency is a measure of how electrons are shared between atoms. This sharing is facilitated by the overlap of atomic orbitals. A greater degree of orbital overlap leads to stronger electron sharing and, consequently, a stronger covalent character."

    # Given information from the problem statement
    fact_CeF6 = "CeF6²⁻ has greater 4f orbital overlap with F 2p orbitals."
    fact_CeCl6 = "CeCl6²⁻ has lesser 4f orbital overlap with Cl 3p orbitals."

    # Logical deduction
    conclusion = "Because CeF6²⁻ exhibits greater orbital overlap, it will have a more significant sharing of electrons between the Cerium (Ce) and Fluorine (F) atoms. This results in a stronger covalent character."

    # Final Answer
    answer = "Therefore, CeF6²⁻ would display stronger covalency compared to CeCl6²⁻."
