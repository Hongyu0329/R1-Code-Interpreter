# We have analyzed the five statements about State Enumeration Graphs (SEG)
# and Logical Attack Graphs (LAG) to find the incorrect one.
#
# A. Correct - Both have exponential worst-case time complexity.
# B. Correct - SEG is more expressive for non-monotonic paths.
# C. Correct - Monotonicity is the primary reason for LAG's compactness.
# D. Incorrect - Probability calculation in cyclic graphs is possible, especially for SEGs using Markov chain models.
# E. Correct - LAGs' monotonicity conflicts with dynamic negation.
#
# The task is to identify and output the letter of the incorrect statement.
# The only incorrect statement is D.
