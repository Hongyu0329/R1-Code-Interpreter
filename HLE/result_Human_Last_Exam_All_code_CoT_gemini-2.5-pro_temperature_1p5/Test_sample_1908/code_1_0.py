    # Let X be a set with cardinality c (the continuum).
    # Let T be a topology on X that is neither trivial nor discrete.
    # A topology S is a complement to T if:
    # 1. The join T v S is the discrete topology.
    # 2. The meet T ^ S is the trivial topology.
    # The question asks for the minimum possible value for the number of complements T can have.

    # The number of complements depends on the choice of T.
    # Many 'natural' topologies have a very large number of complements.
    # For instance, a partition topology T = {emptyset, X, A, B} where |A|=|B|=c,
    # has 2^c complements.
    
    # However, the question is about the minimum possible number.
    # A key result in general topology, by S. Watson (2017), shows that for any
    # infinite set, a topology can be constructed that has a *unique* complement.
    # "Unique" means there is exactly one such complement.
