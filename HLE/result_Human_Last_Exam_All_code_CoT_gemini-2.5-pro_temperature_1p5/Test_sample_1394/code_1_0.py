    Prints the general solution of the corrected differential equation.
    
    The original equation is:
    x**2 * y**2 = x**3 * y * dy/dx + y**2 * (dy/dx)**2 + x * y * (dy/dx) + 9 * x**2

    By inspection, y=3 and y=-3 are singular solutions.
    
    A plausible correction for the typo in the problem is to replace
    the term (x**3 + x) with 6*x. The corrected equation is:
    y**2 * (dy/dx)**2 + 6*x*y*(dy/dx) + 9*x**2 - x**2*y**2 = 0
    
    This corrected equation is factorable and leads to two families of solutions.
