    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the total number of electrons ($N_{elec}$)**: We sum the electrons for each atom in the molecule.\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron per atom\n    *   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n    *   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n    *   For $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$, which has 1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, and 1 F, the total is $6 + (3 \\times 1) + 14 + 9 = 32$ electrons.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of spatial orbitals ($N_{orb}$)**: This is equal to the total number of basis functions in the 6-31G** basis set for this molecule.\n    *   For H: The 6-31G** basis (also written as 6-31G(d,p)) provides 2 's' functions and 1 'p' polarization function set (3 functions). Total: $2+3=5$ basis functions.\n    *   For C: The 6-31G** basis provides 9 functions (from 6-31G) and 1 'd' polarization function set (6 functions). Total: $9+6=15$ basis functions.\n    *   For F: Same as Carbon, it's a second-row atom. Total: $9+6=15$ basis functions.\n    *   For Si: The 6-31G** basis provides 13 functions (from 6-31G) and 1 'd' polarization function set (6 functions). Total: $13+6=19$ basis functions.\n    *   Total for $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ is $1 \\times (\\text{C}) + 3 \\times (\\text{H}) + 1 \\times (\\text{Si}) + 1 \\times (\\text{F}) = 15 + (3 \\times 5) + 19 + 15 = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$ basis functions. So, $N_{orb} = 64$.\n\n3.  **Determine the spin state (S)**: The molecule has 32 electrons (an even number), and we are interested in the ground state, which is a singlet. Therefore, the total spin quantum number $S=0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of CSFs**: For a singlet state ($S=0$), the number of CSFs is given by the formula:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{N_{orb} + 1} \\binom{N_{orb} + 1}{k} \\binom{N_{orb} + 1}{k + 1}$\n    where $k = N_{elec} / 2$.\n    *   Plugging in our values: $N_{orb}=64$, $N_{elec}=32$, so $k=16$.\n    *   The equation becomes: $N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17}$.\n\nThe following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define molecular parameters and calculate total electrons and orbitals\n# Molecular formula: CH2SiHF (1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F)\n# Basis set: 6-31G** (or 6-31G(d,p))\n\n# Number of electrons for each atom\ne_C = 6\ne_H = 1\ne_Si = 14\ne_F = 9\n\n# Number of basis functions for each atom with 6-31G**\nbf_C = 15  # 9 (6-31G) + 6 (d-functions)\nbf_H = 5   # 2 (6-31G) + 3 (p-functions)\nbf_Si = 19 # 13 (6-31G) + 6 (d-functions)\nbf_F = 15  # 9 (6-31G) + 6 (d-functions)\n\n# Total number of electrons (N_elec)\nN_elec = 1 * e_C + 3 * e_H + 1 * e_Si + 1 * e_F\nprint(f\"Total number of electrons (N_elec): {N_elec}\")\n\n# Total number of basis functions / spatial orbitals (N_orb)\nN_orb = 1 * bf_C + 3 * bf_H + 1 * bf_Si + 1 * bf_F\nprint(f\"Total number of spatial orbitals (N_orb): {N_orb}\")\n\n# Step 3: Define spin state\nS = 0\nprint(f\"Total spin (S): {S} (singlet state)\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of CSFs for a singlet state\nif N_elec % 2 != 0:\n    print(\"Full CI for an odd number of electrons is not considered here.\")\nelse:\n    k = N_elec // 2\n    N_orb_p1 = N_orb + 1\n    k_p1 = k + 1\n\n    # The formula is N_CSF = (C(N_orb+1, k) * C(N_orb+1, k+1)) / (N_orb+1)\n    \n    # Calculate the binomial coefficients\n    # Using math.comb for accurate calculation with large numbers\n    comb1 = math.comb(N_orb_p1, k)\n    comb2 = math.comb(N_orb_p1, k_p1)\n\n    # Calculate the final number of CSFs.\n    # The result of the multiplication is guaranteed to be divisible by (N_orb + 1).\n    num_csf = (comb1 * comb2) // N_orb_p1\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the number of CSFs using the formula:\")\n    print(f\"N_CSF = (C({N_orb_p1}, {k}) * C({N_orb_p1}, {k_p1})) / {N_orb_p1}\")\n    print(f\"N_CSF = ({comb1} * {comb2}) / {N_orb_p1}\")\n    print(f\"The number of CSFs is: {num_csf}\")\n\n```\n<<<83288015551712711076923084800>>>"
