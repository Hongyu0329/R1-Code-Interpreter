    print("Here is a step-by-step analysis of each statement:")
    print("="*60)

    # --- Statement 1 Analysis ---
    print("Statement 1: 'There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured.'")
    print("Analysis: The problem explicitly states that the phenotype has 'no bearing on fitness' and that 'all genotypes have equal fitness.'")
    print("This is the definition of a scenario with no natural selection acting on the trait.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 1 MUST be true.\n")

    # --- Statement 2 Analysis ---
    print("Statement 2: 'Parents will not raise their offspring.'")
    print("Analysis: The model assumes 'discrete and non-overlapping generations.' This means that the parental generation dies and is replaced by the offspring generation.")
    print("While this implies parents are not alive when their offspring reach adulthood, it does not strictly forbid all forms of parental care (e.g., provisioning a nest before dying).")
    print("As the statement makes a strong claim about a specific behavior that is not an absolute consequence of the model's assumptions, it does not necessarily have to be true.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 2 does not HAVE to be true.\n")

    # --- Statement 3 Analysis ---
    print("Statement 3: 'The population will never speciate even in future generations.'")
    print("Analysis: Speciation requires evolutionary change. The primary forces of evolution are mutation, selection, genetic drift, and gene flow.")
    print("The problem specifies:")
    print("  - No mutation ('no mutations')")
    print("  - No selection ('no bearing on fitness')")
    print("  - No genetic drift ('infinitely large population')")
    print("  - No gene flow ('no movement of individuals')")
    print("Without any of these evolutionary mechanisms, the population's genetic makeup cannot change. Therefore, it cannot speciate.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 3 MUST be true.\n")
    
    # --- Statement 4 Analysis ---
    print("Statement 4: 'The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals.'")
    print("Analysis: The trait's heritability is HÂ²=0.7, meaning 30% of phenotypic variation is due to environmental factors (Vp = Vg + Ve).")
    print("Random mating across the entire region ensures the genetic component (Vg) is uniform. However, the problem does not state the environment is uniform.")
    print("It is possible for systematic environmental differences to exist between the west and east, which would cause a difference in the average phenotype.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 4 does not HAVE to be true.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("="*60)
    print("Final Summary:")
    print("Only statements 1 and 3 must always be true based on the information given.")
    print("The correct answer choice is the one that includes only statements 1 and 3.")
