    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the range from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n-   $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n-   $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nThe integral must be split at $x=3$ because the function definition changes at that point.\n\nThe total integral is:\n$\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} p(x) dx + \\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx$\n\nSo we will calculate the two integrals separately and then add them up.\n\n1.  **First integral (from 0 to 3):**\n    $\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx$\n\n2.  **Second integral (from 3 to 4):**\n    $\\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)} dx$\n\nI will use Python with the `scipy` library to perform the numerical integration for both parts and then sum the results to get the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the first part of the function for the interval [0, 3]\ndef p_first_part(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function definition for 0 <= x <= 3.\n    p(x) = 2*x**3 / 8\n    \"\"\"\n    return (x**3) / 4\n\n# Define the second part of the function for the interval [3, 5]\ndef p_second_part(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function definition for 3 <= x <= 5.\n    p(x) = e**x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))\n    \"\"\"\n    # Note: np.sin and np.cos work with radians, which is standard for calculus.\n    return np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x)) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first part, from x = 0 to x = 3\nintegral_part1, error_part1 = quad(p_first_part, 0, 3)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second part, from x = 3 to x = 4\nintegral_part2, error_part2 = quad(p_second_part, 3, 4)\n\n# Calculate the total integral\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n# Print the results in the required format\nprint(f\"The integral is calculated by splitting it into two parts:\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 0 to 3 of (x^3 / 4) dx = {integral_part1}\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 3 to 4 of (e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))) dx = {integral_part2}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe total integral from 0 to 4 is the sum of these two parts:\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {integral_part1} + ({integral_part2}) = {total_integral}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.4622316817766>>>"
