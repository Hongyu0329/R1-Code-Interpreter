# The python code will print the final derived equation for the force per unit area.

# The derivation involves applying magnetostatic boundary conditions to solve for the
# magnetic field in the air gap and then using the Maxwell stress tensor to find the
# force on the perfect conductor.
# The numeric constant '2' appears in the denominator of the final formula.
