    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **State the Knowns:**\n    *   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n    *   The orbit is the first Bohr orbit, so the principal quantum number (n) is 1.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n    *   We'll use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2.\n    *   To find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n    *   ħ (reduced Planck's constant) ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p):**\n    *   The angular momentum in a Bohr orbit is quantized: L = mvr = nħ.\n    *   Linear momentum (p) is mv, so p = nħ / r.\n    *   For the first orbit (n=1), the radius (r₁) is the Bohr radius (a₀).\n    *   a₀ ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n    *   Therefore, p = ħ / a₀.\n\n4.  **Find the Ratio (Δp / p):**\n    *   Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)\n    *   By simplifying the expression, the ħ terms cancel out:\n    *   Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\n    *   We will substitute the known values for a₀ and Δx into this simplified formula to calculate the final ratio.\n\n5.  **Write Python Code:**\n    *   The code will define the constants, calculate the ratio using the simplified formula, and print the values used in the calculation along with the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum\n    in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants\n    # Bohr radius (a0) in meters\n    a0 = 5.29177e-11\n    \n    # Given uncertainty in position (delta_x) in meters\n    delta_x_pm = 10\n    delta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12\n\n    # The simplified final equation is: Ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n    \n    # Calculate the ratio\n    ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x_m)\n    \n    print(\"This script calculates the ratio of momentum uncertainty to momentum for an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\")\n    print(\"The simplified equation for the ratio is: Ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\\n\")\n    print(f\"Value of Bohr radius (a0): {a0:.5e} m\")\n    print(f\"Value of uncertainty in position (delta_x): {delta_x_m:.5e} m\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {a0:.5f} / (2 * {delta_x_m})\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {ratio:.4f}\")\n\ncalculate_momentum_ratio()\n<<<2.6459>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit if the uncertainty of its position is 10 pm.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
