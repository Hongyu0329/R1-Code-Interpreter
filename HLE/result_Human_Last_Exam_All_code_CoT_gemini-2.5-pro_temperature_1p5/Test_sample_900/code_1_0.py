# The number of times Svetlana Gileva performed a step formally named "pas de Balanchine".
# This is a conceptual problem rather than a computational one.
# The term "pas de Balanchine" refers to a stylistic quality or sequence,
# not a single, countable step in the official ballet terminology.
# While the solo is deeply influenced by Balanchine's style, there is no
# official step called "pas de Balanchine" to count.
# Therefore, the literal count is 0.
