    "To solve this, I will determine the symmetry factor for the most common Feynman diagram that fits the description: a \"figure-eight\" vacuum bubble diagram in `φ⁴` theory. This diagram consists of two vertices connected by four propagators.\n\nThe symmetry factor, `S`, of a diagram is the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram unchanged. A larger `S` indicates a higher degree of symmetry.\n\nMy plan to calculate `S` is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Vertex Symmetry:** The diagram has two identical vertices. Since swapping them results in the same diagram, this contributes a factor of `2!`.\n2.  **Identify Propagator Symmetry:** All four propagators connect the same two vertices, making them indistinguishable. Permuting these four lines among themselves leaves the diagram unchanged, contributing a factor of `4!`.\n3.  **Calculate Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the individual symmetry factors identified in the previous steps.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan, calculating each factor and then multiplying them to find the final symmetry factor `S`, displaying the full final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with 2 vertices\n    and 4 propagators connecting them (a \"figure-eight\" diagram).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the diagram's components\n    num_vertices = 2\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factor (S) for a 'figure-eight' Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"This diagram has 2 vertices and 4 propagators connecting them.\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Vertex Permutation Symmetry ---\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate the factor from permuting the {num_vertices} identical vertices.\")\n    # The two vertices are identical and can be swapped.
