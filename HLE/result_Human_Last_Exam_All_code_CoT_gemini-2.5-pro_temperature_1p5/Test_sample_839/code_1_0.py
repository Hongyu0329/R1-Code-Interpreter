        "aqueous layer at the particle surface. Within this unique interfacial environment, "
        "the arrangement of ammonium and sulfate ions is drastically different from that in a "
        "dilute bulk solution. This 'redistribution of local charges' enhances the reactivity "
        "of the surface by altering the local thermodynamics. Essentially, the specific "
        "ion arrangement at the interface lowers the overall energy of the system post-reaction, "
        "making the reaction spontaneous and allowing it to proceed without the external energy "
        "it would typically require in other conditions."
