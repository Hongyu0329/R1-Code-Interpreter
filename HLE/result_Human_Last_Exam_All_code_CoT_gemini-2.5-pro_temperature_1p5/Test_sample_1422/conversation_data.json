    "To find the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we will make the standard assumption that the interaction is of the `phi^4` type. The solution can be found by using the topological rules that govern these diagrams.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will start with the two fundamental formulas for connected Feynman diagrams: one relating loops, vertices, and internal lines, and another specific to the `phi^4` interaction which relates vertices to the number of connected lines.\n2.  I will set the number of loops to 2, as required by the problem.\n3.  I will solve this system of equations to express the number of vertices (`V`) in terms of the number of external lines (`E`).\n4.  The formula will show that to minimize `V`, we must minimize `E`. The minimum possible value for `E` is 0 (a \"vacuum diagram\").\n5.  Finally, I will calculate the minimum number of vertices by setting `E=0`.\n\nThe following Python code carries out this plan, printing each step of the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for an interacting scalar field theory (phi^4).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To determine the minimum number of vertices, we will use the topological rules for Feynman diagrams, assuming a phi^4 interaction theory.\")\n    print(\"The variables are: V = number of vertices, I = number of internal lines, E = number of external lines, and L = number of loops.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: State the general formula for the number of loops.\n    print(\"1.
