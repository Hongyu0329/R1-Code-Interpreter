    The self-stabilizing effect is driven by the perception of knowledge gaps.
    - Early Phase: Few perceived gaps, weak effect.
    - Intermediate Phase: Many new gaps perceived, effect grows stronger.
    - Late Phase: Deep knowledge allows for the discovery of more complex and nuanced gaps,
      sustaining a very high level of interest. This is where the effect can be considered to peak.
