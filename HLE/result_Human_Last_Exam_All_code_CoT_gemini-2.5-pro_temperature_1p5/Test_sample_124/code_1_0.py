    # A is false (approximate methods can be more efficient).
    # B is false (it's not resilient to high treewidth).
    # C is true (nodes are cliques, and it uses their joint distributions/potentials).
    # D is false (premise is false).
    # E is true (this is its main limitation).
    # F is false (identical to D).
    # G is true (correctly links the lack of resilience to its mechanism).
    # H is false (the relationship is exponential, not linear).
    # I is true (cost is exponential in the size of the largest clique).
    # J is false.
    # L is true (this is a correct definition of the running intersection property).
