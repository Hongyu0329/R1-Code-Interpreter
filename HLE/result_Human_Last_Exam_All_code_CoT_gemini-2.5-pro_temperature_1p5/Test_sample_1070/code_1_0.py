# The final answer needs to be presented in a specific format.
# The determined first move is Bd3.
# The number of moves for checkmate is 6.
# I will format this into the required "move, number" format.

move = "Bd3"
number_of_moves = 6

print(f"{move}, {number_of_moves}")

# The prompt also asks to output each number in the final equation.
# Since the output is just a string and a number, I will interpret this
# as simply making sure the final number is printed.
# My print statement above already handles this.
