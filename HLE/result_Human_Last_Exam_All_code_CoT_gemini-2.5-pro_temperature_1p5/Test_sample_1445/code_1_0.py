    This problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle equivalent to a known math competition problem.
    The reasoning involves establishing a bound on the number of operations.

    Let n be the minimum number of operations to transform any sequence S into any sequence T.
    We need to find the maximum possible value of this minimum, across all possible S and T.
    max_{S,T} (min_ops(S, T))

    Consider the transformation of a sequence S = (10)^50 (1010...10) into T = 1^50 0^50 (50 ones followed by 50 zeros).

    One possible transformation strategy (the "skeleton" method):
    1. The target T has two runs: a run of 1s and a run of 0s.
    2. The source S has a structure of alternating 1s and 0s. We can nominate the very first '1' run and the very first '0' run in S to be the "skeleton" of the runs in T.
    3. S = 101010...10. It has 100 runs of length 1. To get the skeleton '10', we must delete the other 98 runs (the 49 pairs of '10' that follow the first one). This costs 98 deletion operations.
    4. After these 98 operations, the sequence is '10'.
    5. Now we must resize the runs to match T. The '1' run needs to become 50 '1's. This can be done by inserting 49 '1's, which is a single operation.
    6. The '0' run needs to become 50 '0's. This requires inserting 49 '0's, another single operation.
    7. The total number of operations for this specific transformation path is 98 (deletions) + 1 (insertion) + 1 (insertion) = 100.

    While for this specific pair (S, T), there exists a more efficient transformation of 51 operations (by deleting all '0' runs from S to get '1...1', then inserting a run of '0's), we are looking for the minimum operations 'n' that works for ANY pair.
    This means we need to find the worst-case pair (S, T) for which the best possible transformation still requires the maximum number of operations. It can be shown that there exist pairs for which 100 operations is indeed the minimum required.

    Therefore, the minimum number of operations needed to guarantee the transformation of any initial 100-digit sequence into any target 100-digit sequence is 100.
