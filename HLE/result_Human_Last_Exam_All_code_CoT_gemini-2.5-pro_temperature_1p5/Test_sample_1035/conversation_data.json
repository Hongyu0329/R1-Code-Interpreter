    "The user's question, \"What is the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ where n = 35?\", is phrased in a non-standard way. The term \"number of vertices in a family of graphs\" is ambiguous. The most common and standard interpretation of such a problem in graph theory is to ask for the minimum *number of bipartite graphs* in the family that are required to cover all edges of $K_n$. I will proceed with this interpretation.\n\nThis classic problem is equivalent to finding the **bipartite dimension** of the complete graph $K_n$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Formula**: The minimum number of bipartite subgraphs of $K_n$ needed to cover all its edges is given by the formula $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n2.  **Explain the Formula**:\n    *   **Upper Bound**: We can assign a unique binary string of length $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ to each of the $n$ vertices. For each bit position $i$ (from 1 to $k$), we can create a bipartite graph $B_i$. In $B_i$, the vertices are partitioned into two sets: those with a '0' at bit position $i$ and those with a '1' at bit position $i$. Any edge $(u, v)$ from $K_n$ must have endpoints with different binary labels. These labels must differ in at least one bit position, say position $j$. Therefore, the edge $(u, v)$ will be included in the bipartite graph $B_j$. This construction shows that $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ graphs are sufficient.\n    *   **Lower Bound**: To show this is the minimum, assume we have a covering with $k$ bipartite graphs. We can assign a binary vector of length $k$ to each vertex based on which side of the partition it falls into for each of the $k$ graphs. If two vertices had the same binary vector, they would always be on the same side of the partition in every graph, meaning the edge between them would never be covered. Since all edges must be covered, every vertex must have a unique binary vector. With $k$ bits, we can create $2^k$ unique vectors. To assign a unique vector to each of the $n$ vertices, we need $2^k \\ge n$, which implies $k \\ge \\log_2 n$. Since $k$ must be an integer, $k \\ge \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n3.  **Calculation**: I will write a Python script to calculate this value for $n=35$. The script will show the formula, substitute the value of $n$, and print the result of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_bipartite_covering():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover\n    all edges of a complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # The formula is k = ceil(log2(n))\n    log_val = math.log2(n)\n    result = math.ceil(log_val)\n\n    print(\"The problem is interpreted as finding the minimum number of bipartite graphs (k) needed to cover all edges of the complete graph K_n.\")\n    print(\"The formula for this is: k = ceil(log_2(n))\\n\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the calculation is as follows:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with the value of n\n    print(f\"k = ceil(log_2({n}))\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with the intermediate value of log_2(n)\n    print(f\"k = ceil({log_val})\")\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"k = {result}\")\n\nsolve_bipartite_covering()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
