    explanation = """
    The provided Rust code will not compile due to multiple violations of Rust's borrow checking rules. These errors occur in the `backward` methods of the `MultiHeadAttention` and `FeedForward` structs.

    1. In `MultiHeadAttention::backward`:
       The code attempts to update the weight matrices with lines like:
       `self.w_o = self.w_o.subtract(&d_w_o.mul_scalar(learning_rate));`

       Here's the problem:
       - The method `subtract` is called on `self.w_o`, which creates an immutable borrow (`&self.w_o`) that lasts for the duration of the method call.
       - The assignment `self.w_o = ...` tries to mutate `self.w_o`.
       - The borrow checker forbids mutating a value while it is already immutably borrowed. This results in a compilation error. This error is repeated for `w_q`, `w_k`, and `w_v`.

    2. In `FeedForward::backward`:
       The code attempts to update weights with lines like:
       `self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - ...);`

       Here's the problem:
       - To evaluate the arguments for the `set` call, the `self.w2.get(j, k)` method is called first, creating an immutable borrow of `self.w2`.
       - The `set` method itself requires a mutable borrow of `self.w2` (its signature is `fn set(&mut self, ...)`).
       - It is illegal to have a mutable borrow (`&mut self.w2`) at the same time as an immutable borrow (`&self.w2`). The borrow for `get` must end before the one for `set` can begin, but they overlap in this single statement. This will also cause a compilation error.

    Because these are fundamental borrow checking errors, the compiler will stop and report them. The code will not compile.
