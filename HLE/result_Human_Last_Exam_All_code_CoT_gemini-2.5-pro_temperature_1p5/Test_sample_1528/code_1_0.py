# This code is intended to be run in a SageMath environment,
# as standard Python does not have the necessary algebraic number theory functionalities.
# You can use a free online SageMath tool like SageMathCell.

# 1. Define the polynomial ring over the rational numbers.
R.<x> = QQ['x']

# 2. Define the polynomial f(x) corresponding to the right-hand side of the curve's equation.
f = x**6 + 4*x**5 + 6*x**4 + 2*x**3 + x**2 + 2*x + 1

# 3. Create the hyperelliptic curve object from the polynomial.
C = HyperellipticCurve(f)

# 4. The conductor of a curve is the conductor of its Jacobian variety.
J = C.jacobian()

# 5. Compute the conductor. This is the main calculation.
conductor_value = J.conductor()

# 6. Print the result.
# The following print statement includes all the coefficients from the original equation
# to satisfy the requirement of outputting each number in the final equation.
print("For the curve y^2 = (1)*x^6 + (4)*x^5 + (6)*x^4 + (2)*x^3 + (1)*x^2 + (2)*x + (1):")
print(f"The conductor is {conductor_value}")
