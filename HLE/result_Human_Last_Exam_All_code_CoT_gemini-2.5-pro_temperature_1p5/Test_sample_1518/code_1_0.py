    implication = """
This principle provides a powerful, non-perturbative check on the physics of a theory. It means that any proposed low-energy effective theory, describing composite particles like pions or baryons, must contain the correct set of massless particles to precisely reproduce the anomaly calculated from the fundamental particles (like quarks) in the high-energy theory.

If a proposed IR theory fails this matching test, it is invalidated. Therefore, the most significant physical implication is that the condition places a strong constraint on the possible forms a low-energy effective theory can take, limiting the spectrum and interactions of its massless degrees of freedom.

    analysis = """
- Choice B ('Consistency of UV and IR anomalies') and I ('Ensures IR fields replicate anomalies') describe what the condition *is*, not what its *implication* is.
- Choice C ('Constraint on low-energy effective theories') perfectly captures the main consequence. The condition limits the possibilities for the IR physics.
- Choices F, G, H, and J are all correct consequences that stem from this primary constraint, but C is the most fundamental and overarching statement.
