# The problem statement gives the equation 2^omega_3 = omega_4.
# The task asks to output each number in the final equation.
# Interpreting "the final equation" as the one provided in the problem statement,
# the numbers are 2, 3, and 4.

# The derivation shows the largest cardinality is omega_4. This result is
# consistent with the given equation.
