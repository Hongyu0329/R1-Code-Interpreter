    Calculates the value of the complex integral based on the provided theoretical framework.
    
    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Perform a change of variables in the integral from omega to z. The term z'(omega)d(omega) becomes dz.
    2.  This transforms the integral to the z-plane over a contour N. The new integrand is F(z).
    3.  Analyze the poles of F(z). Poles can occur when omega(z) = mu_0, which corresponds to z=0.
    4.  The problem states the contour N encloses a part of the positive real axis but does not enclose z=0.
    5.  Other potential poles and branch cuts are also outside the contour N.
    6.  Since the integrand is analytic inside the integration contour, by Cauchy's Integral Theorem, the integral is zero.
    7.  The result is an M x M zero matrix, as the integrand is matrix-valued.
