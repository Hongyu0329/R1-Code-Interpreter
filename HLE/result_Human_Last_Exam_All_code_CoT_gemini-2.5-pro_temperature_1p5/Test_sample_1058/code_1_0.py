# Experimental Data Points
ps_amplitude_ap_rat = -0.38  # mV, alcohol-preferring
ps_amplitude_sp_rat = -0.17  # mV, sucrose-preferring
ps_amplitude_knockdown_rat = -0.37 # mV, Slc6a11 knockdown in sucrose-preferring rat

# --- Logical Deduction Step-by-Step ---

# 1. Determine relative neuronal activity in the amygdala.
# A larger absolute population spike (PS) amplitude indicates higher synchronous firing and thus higher network activity/excitability.
activity_conclusion = ""
if abs(ps_amplitude_ap_rat) > abs(ps_amplitude_sp_rat):
    activity_conclusion = "increased neuronal activity"
else:
    activity_conclusion = "decreased neuronal activity"

# 2. Interpret the gene knockdown experiment.
# The gene Slc6a11 codes for a GABA transporter. Knocking it down increases extracellular GABA.
# The knockdown phenotype (-0.37 mV) mimics the alcohol-preferring phenotype (-0.38 mV).
# This implies the mechanism in alcohol-preferring rats is similar.
gaba_level_conclusion = "higher extracellular GABA"
tonic_inhibition_conclusion = "increased tonic inhibition"

# 3. Propose a pharmacological intervention.
# The alcohol-preferring state is linked to the effects of high GABA (increased tonic inhibition and excitability).
# To counteract this, one would block GABA receptors, not activate them further.
treatment_conclusion = "GABA receptor antagonist"

# 4. Evaluate the answer choices based on our deductions.
