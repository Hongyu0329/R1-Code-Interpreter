    "I will solve this problem by designing a deadbeat observer. A deadbeat observer is designed such that the observer error converges to zero in the shortest possible time. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of the observer error dynamics matrix at the origin of the z-plane.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Define the system matrices `A` and `C`.\n2.  The observer error dynamics are described by `e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`, where `L` is the observer gain matrix we need to find.\n3.  To achieve a deadbeat response, all eigenvalues of the matrix `(A - LC)` must be placed at 0. So, our desired poles are `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n4.  This is a pole placement problem. We can solve it using the principle of duality. The problem of finding `L` to place the poles of `(A - LC)` is dual to the problem of finding a state-feedback gain `K_dual` to place the poles of `(A^T - C^T * K_dual)`.\n5.  I will use the `place_poles` function from the `scipy.signal` library to find this `K_dual` for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)`.\n6.  The required observer gain `L` is simply the transpose of the calculated `K_dual`.\n7.  The final Python script will define the matrices, perform the calculation, and print the resulting gain matrix `L`. This calculation is possible because the system `(A, C)` is observable.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.signal import place_poles\n\n# Define the system matrices A and C based on the problem description.\n# The system is x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k), y(k) = Cx(k).\n# We are designing an observer, so the B matrix is not needed for the gain calculation.\nA = np.array([\n    [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 1, 0, -1],\n    [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n])\n\nC = np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1]\n])\n\n# The state vector has dimension n.\nn = A.shape[0]\n\n# For a deadbeat observer, the error must go to zero in the shortest number of steps.\n# This requires placing all eigenvalues (poles) of the error dynamics matrix (A - LC) at the origin.\ndesired_poles = np.zeros(n)\n\n# We can find the observer gain L using pole placement on the dual system.\n# The eigenvalues of (A - LC) are the same as the eigenvalues of (A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T * L^T.\n# We can use a standard pole placement function to find K_dual = L^T for the system (A^T, C^T).\n# The place_poles function finds K such that the eigenvalues of (A - BK) are p.\n# For our dual problem, we use A.T for A, C.T for B, and K_dual for K.\ntry:\n    placement_result = place_poles(A.T, C.T, desired_poles)\n    K_dual = placement_result.gain\n\n    # The observer gain L is the transpose of the calculated gain K_dual for the dual system.\n    L = K_dual.T\n\n    # Print the resulting observer gain matrix L.\n    print(\"The gain matrix L for the deadbeat observer is:\")\n    print(L)\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An error occurred during pole placement.
