# My plan is to identify all organisms from the provided list that are known
# to perform any type of photochemical synthesis as part of their own metabolism.
# This includes photosynthesis (oxygenic and anoxygenic) and other light-driven
# synthesis processes. I will ignore processes carried out by symbionts.
# After identifying the correct indices, I will print them in a comma-separated list.

# 1) Acanthella cavernosa: A marine sponge (animal). Does not photosynthesize.
# 2) Gloeochaete wittrockiana: A glaucophyte alga. Performs oxygenic photosynthesis. (Yes)
# 3) Homo sapiens: An animal. Performs photochemical synthesis of Vitamin D in the skin using UV light. (Yes)
# 4) Riftia pachyptila: A tube worm (animal). Relies on chemosynthetic, not photosynthetic, symbionts. Does not perform it itself.
# 5) Halapricum salinum: A haloarchaeon. Known to be phototrophic, using light to generate energy (photochemical synthesis of ATP). (Yes)
# 6) Aphanothece castagnei: A cyanobacterium. Performs oxygenic photosynthesis. (Yes)
# 7) Baileya pleniradiata: A flowering plant. Performs oxygenic photosynthesis. (Yes)
# 8) Acanthella pulchra: A marine sponge (animal). Does not photosynthesize.
# 9) Ectothiorhodosinus mongolicus: A purple sulfur bacterium. Performs anoxygenic photosynthesis. (Yes)
# 10) Chlorobaculum tepidum: A green sulfur bacterium. Performs anoxygenic photosynthesis. (Yes)
# 11) Stygichthys typhlops: A blind cavefish (animal). Lives in darkness and does not photosynthesize.
# 12) Gemmatimonas phototrophica: The first identified phototrophic member of the Gemmatimonadetes phylum. Performs anoxygenic photosynthesis. (Yes)
# 13) Myonera garretti: A bivalve mollusc (animal). Does not photosynthesize.

# The indices of the organisms that perform photochemical synthesis are:
qualifying_indices = [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12]

# Prepare the output string as per the user's request.
output_string = ",".join(map(str, qualifying_indices))

# Print the final result.
print(output_string)
