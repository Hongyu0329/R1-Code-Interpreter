    print(" - δ 8.69 (t, J = 5.7 Hz, 1H): This triplet is an N-H proton coupled to the adjacent methylene group (δ 4.73). This confirms the presence of a benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-Ph).")

    print("---------------------------------------------------------")
    print(" - The problem states 'tertbutyl hydrazine' was used. However, a product with a hydrazinyl group (-NH-NH-tBu) would likely show two distinct NH protons for that group. The provided spectra fit better with a simpler tert-butylamino group (-NH-tBu).")
    print(" - Assuming the product has a tert-butylamino group, the singlet at δ 8.11 can be assigned to its N-H proton.")
    print(" - This leaves the singlet at δ 8.24 as a single C-H proton on the heterocyclic ring.")
    print(" - A heterocyclic core with two amine substituents and one C-H proton that fits the 13C data (especially the downfield C's at δ 156.89, 154.96, 152.80) is a purine ring.")
    print(" - The structure is consistent with 2,6-disubstituted purine. The C-H proton is at the C8 position.")
    print(" - Therefore, the final product is most likely 2-(tert-butylamino)-6-(benzylamino)purine (or its isomer).")

    print(" - The synthesis involves two sequential reactions where nucleophiles (tert-butylamine/hydrazine and benzylamine) are added.")
    print(" - This indicates a nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism where the amines replace leaving groups on the purine ring.")
    print(" - The most common and reactive leaving groups for this type of chemistry are halogens, specifically chlorine.")
