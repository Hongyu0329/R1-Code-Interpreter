    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against a quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric encryption, which is Grover's algorithm.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Establish the Security Baseline:** The current industry standard for strong encryption against classical (non-quantum) computers is a security level of 128 bits. This means a classical computer would need to perform approximately 2^128 operations to break the key, which is considered computationally infeasible. We want to maintain this same level of difficulty for a quantum computer.\n2.  **Understand the Quantum Threat (Grover's Algorithm):** Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, such as brute-forcing a symmetric key. For a key of `k` bits, a classical computer needs roughly 2^k operations. A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm only needs about sqrt(2^k) operations, which is equal to 2^(k/2).\n3.  **Formulate the Equation:** This effectively means that a quantum computer halves the security level of a symmetric key in terms of bits. To achieve a quantum security level equivalent to our 128-bit classical baseline, the key length (`k`) must satisfy the equation: `k / 2 = 128`.\n4.  **Calculate the Required Key Length:** Solving for `k`, we get `k = 128 * 2`, which equals 256. Therefore, to achieve 128 bits of security against a quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and explains the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length needed to resist attacks\n    from a powerful quantum computer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the target security level in bits.\n    # This is the strength we want to maintain, equivalent to strong classical encryption.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    # 2. Define the quantum speedup factor for symmetric key search.\n    # Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup, which halves the effective\n    # bit strength of a key. This corresponds to a factor of 2.\n    grover_speedup_factor = 2\n\n    # 3. Calculate the required key length.\n    # To counteract the halving of security, we must double the key length.\n    # Equation: Required Key Length = Target Security Level * Grover's Speedup Factor\n    required_key_length = target_security_level * grover_speedup_factor\n\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(\"A quantum computer can use Grover's algorithm to attack symmetric keys.\")\n    print(\"This algorithm effectively halves the security strength of the key.\")\n    print(\"To maintain a desired security level against a quantum computer, we must double the key length.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"Desired Security Level: {target_security_level} bits\")\n    print(f\"Grover's Algorithm Security Reduction Factor: {grover_speedup_factor}\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {required_key_length} = {target_security_level} * {grover_speedup_factor}\")\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: To achieve {target_security_level}-bit security against a quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least {required_key_length} bits long.\")\n\ncalculate_quantum_resistant_key_length()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
