    "My plan is to analyze the training methodologies of the ballet schools listed in the answer choices, specifically focusing on their approach to pointe work during barre exercises. I will then write a Python script that stores this information and identifies which school is most known for having its female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. The script will print the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_school_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet school training methods to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    schools = {\n        'A': {\n            \"name\": \"La Scala\",\n            \"info\": \"Follows the Italian Cecchetti method, which emphasizes a gradual and systematic build-up of strength.
