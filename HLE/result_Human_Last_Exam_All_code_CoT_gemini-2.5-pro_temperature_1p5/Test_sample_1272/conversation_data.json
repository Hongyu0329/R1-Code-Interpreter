    "To determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam, we need to examine his military campaigns during the Ming occupation.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific historical event:** Mu Sheng's significant defeat occurred during the Lam Sơn War (1418–1427), not the initial invasion (1406–1407), which was largely successful for the Ming.\n2.  **Pinpoint the battle:** In late 1427, two Ming armies were sent to relieve the besieged city of Dongguan (modern-day Hanoi). One, under Liu Sheng, was famously destroyed at Chi Lăng. The other, led by Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan.\n3.  **Locate the defeat:** Upon hearing of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat, Mu Sheng's army panicked. They were subsequently ambushed and decisively defeated by Vietnamese forces under Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả at Lãnh Câu Pass (Ải Lưu) and Đan Xá, forcing them to retreat.\n4.  **Map to modern-day province:** Historical sources place Lãnh Câu Pass (Ải Lưu) in the area of modern-day Văn Bàn District.\n5.  **Final conclusion:** This district is located within the present-day **Lào Cai Province**.\n\nThe following Python script will print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng\n    experienced his first major defeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    general = \"Ming General Mu Sheng\"\n    year_of_defeat = 1427\n    battle_location_historical = \"Lãnh Câu Pass (Ải Lưu)\"\n    modern_province = \"Lào Cai Province\"\n\n    print(f\"The first major defeat for {general} in Vietnam occurred in the year {year_of_defeat}.\")\n    print(f\"His army was ambushed and routed at {battle_location_historical}.\")\n    print(f\"This historical site is located in the modern-day Vietnamese province of: {modern_province}\")\n\nfind_defeat_location()\n```\n<<<Lào Cai Province>>>"
