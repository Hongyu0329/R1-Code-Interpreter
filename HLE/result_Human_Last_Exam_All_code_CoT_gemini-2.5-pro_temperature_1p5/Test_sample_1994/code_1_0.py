# The target number
N = 10**100

# 1. Calculate the number of sequences, interpreted as the number of terms in the sum.
# This is equivalent to counting the set bits ('1's) in the binary representation of N.
num_sequences = bin(N).count('1')

# 2. Find the largest term. This corresponds to the largest exponent 'c' in the sum N = sum(2^c).
# The largest exponent is the position of the most significant bit of N.
# For an integer N, its MSB position is floor(log2(N)), which is N.bit_length() - 1.
c_max = N.bit_length() - 1

# 3. Calculate a1 and b1 for this largest term.
# The relationship is c_max = 2^(a1-1) + b1, with b1 < 2^(a1-1).
# From this, a1 - 1 = floor(log2(c_max)).
a1_exponent = c_max.bit_length() - 1
a1 = a1_exponent + 1

# And b1 is the remainder.
# b1 = c_max - 2^(a1-1) = c_max - 2^(a1_exponent)
b1 = c_max - (1 << a1_exponent)

# 4. Print the final results as requested.
# The output format is: count_of_sequences a1 b1
