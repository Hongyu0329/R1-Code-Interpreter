# The problem asks for the largest possible dimension of the quotient ring R/I.
# R is the polynomial ring C[x_1, ..., x_10].
# G is a finite group of order 10000.
# The action of G on R is defined by a group homomorphism (a representation) rho: G -> GL_10(C).
# The group that effectively acts on the polynomial ring is the image of this representation, H = rho(G).
# I is the ideal in R generated by all homogeneous G-invariant (or more precisely, H-invariant)
# polynomials of positive degree.

# A fundamental theorem in invariant theory states that the dimension of the coinvariant algebra R/I
# is equal to the order of the acting group H.
# dim(R/I) = |H|

# Our goal is to find the maximum possible value for dim(R/I), which is equivalent to maximizing |H|.

# The order of the group G is given.
order_G = 10000

# According to the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, the image of a homomorphism rho
# is isomorphic to the quotient of the domain by the kernel: H is isomorphic to G/ker(rho).
# This implies a relationship between their orders: |H| = |G| / |ker(rho)|.

# To maximize the order of H, we must minimize the order of the kernel of rho.
# The kernel of a homomorphism is a subgroup, so its order must be at least 1
# (the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element).
min_ker_rho_order = 1

# Therefore, the maximum possible order for H is |G| divided by the minimum kernel order.
max_order_H = order_G / min_ker_rho_order

# This maximum is achievable if and only if there exists a group G of order 10000 that
# has a faithful 10-dimensional representation (a representation with a trivial kernel).
#
# We can demonstrate that such a group and representation exist.
# Let G be the cyclic group of order 10000, G = C_10000.
# Let g be a generator of G, and let zeta = exp(2*pi*i/10000) be a primitive 10000-th root of unity.
# The group G has a faithful 1-dimensional representation chi: G -> C*, where chi(g) = zeta.
# We can extend this to a faithful 10-dimensional representation rho: G -> GL_10(C) by defining:
# rho(g^k) = diag(chi(g^k), 1, 1, ..., 1).
# This representation rho is faithful because rho(g^k) being the identity matrix implies chi(g^k) = 1,
# which, because chi is faithful, implies g^k is the identity element of G.
#
# Since a faithful 10-dimensional representation of a group of order 10000 exists,
# the maximum possible order for H is indeed |G| = 10000.
largest_dimension = max_order_H
