    "My plan is to write a Python script that solves this problem by performing the following steps:\n\n1.  **Fetch the Text**: Download the full text of Chaucer's \"The Book of the Duchess\" from a public source (Project Gutenberg).\n2.  **Process the Text**: Clean the text by removing headers, footers, and punctuation. Then, split the poem into individual lines. For each line, I will identify the last word, as this is where rhymes occur.\n3.  **Define a Rhyme Checker**: I will create a simple function to determine if two words from Middle English are likely to rhyme. A good starting point (heuristic) is to check if the last three letters of the words are identical.\n4.  **Analyze Target Words**: The script will iterate through each of the provided words (Wente, Here, Fool, Hool, Countour). For each word, it will search the entire poem to see if it appears at the end of a line.\n5.  **Find a Rhyming Pair**: If the target word is found at the end of a line, the script will check if the adjacent line's last word forms a rhyme with it, according to the rhyme checker. Since the poem is mostly in rhyming couplets, checking the next line is the most reliable method.\n6.  **Draw a Conclusion**: If at least one instance of a target word is found within a rhyming pair, it is considered a rhymed word. If a word appears at the end of a line but never in a rhyming pair, it is the answer. The script will print its findings for each word and state the final conclusion.\n\nThis process will systematically verify which word, according to the specified text and rules, Chaucer fails to rhyme.\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\nimport re\nimport string\n\ndef solve_chaucer_rhyme():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes Chaucer's \"The Book of the Duchess\" to find which\n    of a given list of words is not used in a rhyming couplet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define target words from the multiple-choice question.\n    target_words = {\n        'A': 'wente',\n        'B': 'here',\n        'C': 'fool',\n        'D': 'hool',\n        'E': 'countour'\n    }\n    print(\"Task: Find the word Chaucer does NOT make a rhyme with from the following choices:\")\n    for key, word in target_words.items():\n        print(f\"  {key}. {word.capitalize()}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2: Download the text from Project Gutenberg.\n    try:\n        url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2418/2418-0.txt\"\n        with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:\n            # Use utf-8-sig to handle potential Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the file start\n            raw_text = response.read().decode('utf-8-sig')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Failed to download the text of the poem.
