    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who is known for their work in semiotics and the theory of signs.\n2.  I will then confirm that this philosopher's work includes the specific distinction between \"symptoms\" (natural signs causally related to their object) and \"signals\" (conventional signs) as components of the broader notion of a \"hallmark\" or sign.\n3.  Finally, I will create a simple Python script to store this philosopher's name in a variable and print it as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_philosophy_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher\n    who distinguished between symptoms and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The philosopher known for this specific work in the theory of signs\n    # is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. He analyzed the concept of a sign (or hallmark)\n    # and broke it down into different types, including symptoms (indices) and\n    # signals (conventional signs).\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals is: {philosopher}\")\n\nsolve_philosophy_question()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
