    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Cubes**: I will represent the two cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. To make the calculations straightforward, I'll assume the cubes' sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. I'll define the first cube (C1) as occupying the region `[0, 1] x [0, 1] x [0, 1]`. It has a side length of 1.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Shift**: For a cube in this orientation, a \"main diagonal\" connects opposite corners, like `(0, 0, 0)` and `(1, 1, 1)`. A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is best interpreted as a shift vector of `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This means the second cube (C2) is displaced from the first by 0.5 units along the x-axis, 0.5 units along the y-axis, and 0.5 units along the z-axis.\n\n3.  **Define the Second Cube**: By applying this shift to C1, the second cube (C2) will occupy the region from `0.5` to `1.5` on each axis: `[0.5, 1.5] x [0.5, 1.5] x [0.5, 1.5]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Intersection Region**: The volume of the intersection is the region where both cubes overlap. I can find this by determining the overlap along each axis independently.\n    *   **x-axis**: The overlap between C1's range `[0, 1]` and C2's range `[0.5, 1.5]` is `[0.5, 1]`. The length of this overlap is `1 - 0.5 = 0.5`.\n    *   **y-axis**: The overlap is identical to the x-axis, with a length of `0.5`.\n    *   **z-axis**: The overlap is also identical, with a length of `0.5`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Volume**: The intersection of the two cubes forms a new, smaller cube with a side length of 0.5. The volume of this intersection is simply the side length cubed: `0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5`.\n\n6.  **Code the Solution**: I will create a Python script to perform this calculation and print the logic, the final equation with all its components, and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cube_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two cubes shifted along a main diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Each cube has a side length of 1.\n    side_length = 1\n\n    # The shift along the main diagonal is 1/2.\n    # In an axis-aligned system, this corresponds to a shift of 1/2 in each dimension.\n    shift = 0.5\n\n    # The intersection of two axis-aligned boxes is another axis-aligned box.\n    # To find its volume, we first find the length of its sides.\n\n    # Let the first cube occupy the range [0, 1] on an axis.\n    # The second, shifted cube occupies the range [0.5, 1.5] on that same axis.\n    # The intersection is the range [0.5, 1].\n    # The length of this intersection is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n    \n    # In general, for a side length S and a shift d, the overlap is S - d.\n    intersection_side_length = side_length - shift\n\n    # The volume of the intersection (which is a cube) is its side length cubed.\n    volume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the initial parameters.\")\n    print(f\"Side length of each cube = {side_length}\")\n    print(f\"Shift along each axis = {shift}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine the side length of the intersection volume.\")\n    print(\"The intersection forms a smaller cube. Its side length is the overlap in any single dimension.\")\n    print(f\"Intersection side length = (Original side length) - (Shift)\")\n    print(f\"Intersection side length = {side_length} - {shift} = {intersection_side_length}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the volume of the intersection cube.\")\n    print(\"Volume = (Intersection side length)^3\")\n    print(f\"Volume = ({side_length} - {shift})^3 = {intersection_side_length}^3 = {volume}\")\n\nsolve_cube_intersection()\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
