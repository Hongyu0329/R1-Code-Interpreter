    "To determine the rule activation level of a fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule with the membership value of the consequent part. The problem specifies using a t-norm operation for this combination.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The firing strength of the rule's antecedent, `Phi_k(x′)`, is 0.7.\n    *   The membership grade of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)`, is 0.9.\n2.  **Select the T-norm:** A t-norm is a function that models the logical \"AND\" in fuzzy logic. While there are several types of t-norms (e.g., product, Lukasiewicz), the most commonly used one is the **minimum t-norm**. We will use this for the calculation.\n3.  **Apply the t-norm:** The rule activation level is calculated by taking the minimum of the two given values.\n    *   Activation Level = `min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   Activation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** A simple Python script will be created to define the variables, perform the `min()` operation, and print the full equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# The firing strength of the antecedent part of the fuzzy rule.\nphi_k = 0.7\n\n# The membership value of the consequent part of the fuzzy rule.\nmu_g = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm operation is used to combine these values to find the rule activation level.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operation.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_g)\n\nprint(\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm operation:\")\nprint(f\"min({phi_k}, {mu_g}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
