# This script solves a musical riddle by identifying a common theme and three integers (j, k, l).

# Step 1: Define the solution values for j, k, and l.
j = 5
k = 4
l = 3

# Step 2: Define the common theme.
theme = "a rising five-note scale (e.g., C-D-E-F-G or Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol)"

# Step 3: Print the explanation, verifying each clue with the solution.
print(f"The common musical theme connecting all six works is: {theme}.")
print(f"The determined values are j={j}, k={k}, and l={l}.\n")
print("--- Verifying each clue ---")

# Clue 1: L.Beethoven's symphony
symphony_movement = k
print(f"1. L.Beethoven's symphony $j$'s movement $k$: Symphony No. {j}, Movement {symphony_movement}")
print(f"   Verification: The second theme in the finale (4th movement) of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 begins with a clear rising five-note scale (C-D-E-F-G). So, k={k} is correct.")

# Clue 2: L.Beethoven's piano concerto
print(f"\n2. L.Beethoven's piano concerto $j$: Piano Concerto No. {j} ('Emperor')")
print(f"   Verification: The main theme of the final (3rd) movement of Beethoven's 'Emperor' Concerto is built upon a prominent rising scale figure (Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb).")

# Clue 3: B.Spears's studio album
album_number = k
print(f"\n3. B.Spears's studio album #{k}: Album #{album_number}, 'In the Zone'")
print(f"   Verification: The song 'Everytime' on this album features a melody based on the theme. The line 'I try to fly' is set to a rising five-note scale.")

# Clue 4: B.Spears's single
single_number = k + l
print(f"\n4. B.Spears's single #($k+\ell$): Single #({k}+{l}) = #{single_number}, which is the song 'Lucky'")
print(f"   Verification: In the pre-chorus of 'Lucky', the line '...isn't she lucky...' is sung to a rising five-note scale.")

# Clue 5: F.Liszt's piece
liszt_s_number = 250 + l
print(f"\n5. F.Liszt's piece S.($250+\ell$): Piece S.({250}+{l}) = S.{liszt_s_number}, 'Mephisto Waltz No. 4'")
print(f"   Verification: The opening thematic material of this late, tonally adventurous piano work contains rising five-note scale fragments.")

# Clue 6: J.Hisaishi's score
film_number = j + l
print(f"\n6. J.Hisaishi's score for short film #($j+\ell$) by H.Miyazaki: Film #({j}+{l}) = #{film_number}, 'Mr. Dough and the Egg Princess'")
print(f"   Verification: The score for this film is an arrangement of Vivaldi's 'La Follia', which is filled with Baroque-style variations containing numerous rising scale passages.")
