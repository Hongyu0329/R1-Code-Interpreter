    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve Type**: The curve is a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. In our case, `x(t) = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, so we have `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n2.  **Use the Standard Formula**: For a Lissajous curve of the form `x = cos(at), y = sin(bt)`, there's a well-established formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points, provided that `a` and `b` are relatively prime integers (their greatest common divisor is 1). The formula is:\n    `Number of intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n\n3.  **Verify the Conditions**:\n    *   `a = 9` and `b = 5` are integers.\n    *   We check if they are relatively prime by finding their greatest common divisor (GCD). `GCD(9, 5) = 1`.\n    *   Since the conditions are met, the formula is applicable.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result**: We will substitute `a = 9` and `b = 5` into the formula and compute the result.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of self-intersection points for the\n    Lissajous curve defined by (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters from the curve equations\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections of a Lissajous curve\n    # (cos(at), sin(bt)) for coprime integers a and b is (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n    \n    # Check if a and b are coprime\n    if math.gcd(a, b) == 1:\n        # Calculate the components of the formula\n        a_minus_1 = a - 1\n        b_minus_1 = b - 1\n        numerator = a_minus_1 * b_minus_1\n        num_intersections = numerator // 2\n\n        print(\"The number of self-intersection points for the curve (cos(at), sin(bt)) is calculated using the formula:\")\n        print(\"N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2\")\n        print(f\"\\nFor the given curve, a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n        print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n        print(f\"N = ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {a_minus_1} * {b_minus_1} / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {numerator} / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {num_intersections}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The parameters a={a} and b={b} are not coprime, so the standard formula does not apply.\")\n\n# Run the calculation\nfind_lissajous_intersections()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
