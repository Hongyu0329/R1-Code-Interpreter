    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Consult a definitive source:** The primary repository for microRNA sequences and annotation is miRBase. I will use the information from this database.\n2.  **List the members:** Based on miRBase, I will identify all the unique members of the let-7 family in humans (*Homo sapiens*). This includes let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n3.  **Write a Python script:** I will create a script that stores these members in a list. The script will then calculate the length of the list to get the total count.\n4.  **Display the results:** The script will first print each member and then show the final count as a sum of each member, making the calculation clear as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_human_let7_family():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function lists the members of the human let-7 microRNA family\n    and prints the total count.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The let-7 family members in humans are well-established.\n    # Data is based on the miRBase database, the primary repository for microRNA data.\n    # The members are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i,\n    # and miR-98.
