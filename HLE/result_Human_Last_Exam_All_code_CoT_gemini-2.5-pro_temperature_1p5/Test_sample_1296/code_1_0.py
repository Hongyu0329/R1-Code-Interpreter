    # (a) If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    #
    # G acts quasiprimitively on the face set F. By definition, this means every
    # non-trivial normal subgroup of G is transitive on F. The socle N is a
    # non-trivial normal subgroup, so it must be transitive on F.
    # The faces of the quotient dessin D_N are the orbits of N on F.
    # Since N is transitive, there is only one orbit.
    # Therefore, D_N has only one face and is unicellular.
    # This is true regardless of the structure of G/N.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # (b) Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group of D.
    #
    # The automorphism group G of a regular dessin must be 2-generated.
    # HA (Holomorph of an Abelian group): Yes, affine groups are a classic example
    # of 2-generated groups that are automorphism groups of regular dessins.
    # AS (Almost Simple): Yes, many almost simple groups (like PSL(2,p)) are
    # 2-generated and act as automorphism groups of regular dessins.
    # TW (Twisted Wreath product): No. A group G = T wr Z_l where T is a non-abelian
    # simple group is not 2-generated. Therefore, it cannot be the automorphism
    # group of a regular dessin.
    answer_b = "HA, AS"

    # (c) True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
    #
    # As established in (b), a group G of type TW cannot be the automorphism group
    # of a regular dessin D because it is not 2-generated.
    # Thus, the premise of the statement ("G is of type TW...") is false within
    # the context of the problem.
    # In logic, an implication with a false premise (P -> Q where P is false) is
    # always considered true. This is a "vacuously true" statement.
    # The condition l <= 5 is irrelevant.
    answer_c = "True"
