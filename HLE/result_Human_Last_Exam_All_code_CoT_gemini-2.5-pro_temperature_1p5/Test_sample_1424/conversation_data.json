    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, as in other formulations of quantum many-body theory, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function $G_0$ has a distinct functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Explanation of the Relationship\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ describes the propagation of a single particle with momentum $k$ and energy $\\omega$ through a non-interacting system. Its mathematical form in energy-momentum space is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nHere is a breakdown of the terms:\n*   **$G_0(k, \\omega)$**: The bare Green's function.\n*   **$\\omega$**: The energy of the particle being added to or removed from the system.\n*   **$\\epsilon_k$**: The single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum (or wavevector) $k$. This is the quantity you asked about.\n*   **$\\mu$**: The chemical potential, which defines the Fermi energy at zero temperature. States with $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$ are occupied, and states with $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$ are empty.\n*   **$\\eta$**: An infinitesimally small positive number ($\\eta \\to 0^+$) that correctly positions the poles of the Green's function in the complex plane, ensuring causality.\n*   **sgn($x$)**: The sign function, which is +1 for $x>0$ and -1 for $x<0$.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the bare Green's function **is inversely proportional to the energy of the probe particle, $\\omega$, minus the system's single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$** (shifted by the chemical potential $\\mu$). The function diverges (has a pole) when $\\omega$ is close to the energy required to create a particle or a hole at the energy level $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Python Demonstration\n\nThe following Python code defines a function for $G_0(k, \\omega)$ and demonstrates the calculation for both an occupied and an unoccupied state. It prints the step-by-step calculation, showing how the final value depends explicitly on $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, mu, eta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0(k, omega).\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The probe particle energy.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        mu (float): The chemical potential.\n        eta (float): A small positive infinitesimal.\n\n    Returns:\n        complex: The value of the Green's function.\n    \"\"\"\n    energy_diff = epsilon_k - mu\n    sign = np.sign(energy_diff)\n    \n    # Handle the case where epsilon_k == mu, where the sign is 0\n    if sign == 0:\n        # At the Fermi level, the pole structure is more complex.\n        # For this demonstration, we can treat it as the unoccupied case,\n        # but in reality it's a mix of both.
