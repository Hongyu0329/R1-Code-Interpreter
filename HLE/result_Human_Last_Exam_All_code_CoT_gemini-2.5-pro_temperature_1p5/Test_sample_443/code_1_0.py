# The final result is derived from the logical steps above.
# The question is a known, non-trivial result from real algebraic geometry.
# The area of the general surface inside a cylinder can scale as D^2, unlike the O(D) scaling inside a ball.
# The condition on the tangent plane angle does not reduce this worst-case complexity.
# The construction of a surface requiring Ω(D^2) balls provides the lower bound.
# The general area bound for surfaces in a cylinder provides the upper bound.
# So, the smallest possible value for k is 2.
