# Define the parameters given in the problem
n = 2024  # The number of sets
k = 45    # The size of each set

# As derived in the reasoning, the condition n-1 > k*(k-1) forces a unique
# structure for the sets, known as a sunflower. In this structure, all sets
# share a single common element, and the rest of their elements are unique.

# The total size of the union is the central element (1) plus the sum of
# the sizes of the non-shared parts of each set (n * (k-1)).
union_size = 1 + n * (k - 1)
non_shared_per_set = k - 1
total_non_shared = n * non_shared_per_set

# Print the step-by-step calculation as a final equation
