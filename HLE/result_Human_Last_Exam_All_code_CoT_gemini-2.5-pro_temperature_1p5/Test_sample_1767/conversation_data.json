    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For a system composed of multiple non-interacting or weakly coupled subsystems, the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual subsystems. This property is known as the additivity of the Chern number.\n2.  **Assign variables:** Let's denote the Chern number of the first insulator as `C1` and the second insulator as `C2`. According to the problem, `C1 = 1` and `C2 = 1`.\n3.  **Formulate the equation:** The total Chern number of the junction, `C_total`, is `C_total = C1 + C2`.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a simple Python script that defines `C1` and `C2`, calculates their sum, and prints an explanation along with the final equation, showing all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators\nC1 = 1\nC2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number is an additive topological invariant.\n# For a junction of two systems with negligible interaction or tunneling,\n# the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers\nprint(\"The Chern number of a junction is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual systems.\")\nprint(f\"The equation for the total Chern number (C_total) is: C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"Given C1 = {C1} and C2 = {C2}, the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{C1} + {C2} = {C_total}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe Chern number of this junction is {C_total}.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
