    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a wonderful riddle that combines wordplay and basic arithmetic.\n\nHere is my plan to solve it:\n1.  First, I will decode the numerical clues hidden within each line of the haiku.\n2.  The line \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" suggests our starting number, which is `2 * 15 = 30`.\n3.  The line \"An August tempest\" suggests a number to be subtracted. August is the 8th month of the year, so we get the number 8.\n4.  The line \"A divine one yields\" suggests another subtraction. \"Yields\" means to give way, and \"a divine one\" is the number 1.\n5.  I will then construct the equation `30 - 8 - 1` and find the result.\n6.  The result of the equation is a number that corresponds to a letter in the alphabet (where A=1, B=2, etc.).\n7.  This letter is the answer to the question in the title, \"The Bays,\" because of its shape.\n8.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation, print out the full equation, and reveal the final letter.\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef solve_haiku_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle presented in the haiku \"The Bays\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Decode the numbers from the haiku clues.\n    # \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n    start_number = 2 * 15\n    # \"An August tempest\"\n    first_subtraction = 8\n    # \"A divine one yields\"\n    second_subtraction = 1\n\n    # 2. Perform the calculation.\n    final_number = start_number - first_subtraction - second_subtraction\n\n    # 3. Find the corresponding letter of the alphabet.\n    # A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26\n    # string.ascii_uppercase is a string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    # The index will be final_number - 1 since string indices are 0-based.\n    if 1 <= final_number <= 26:\n        alphabet = string.ascii_uppercase\n        final_letter = alphabet[final_number - 1]\n    else:\n        final_letter = \"Invalid\"\n\n    # 4. Print the logic, the equation, and the final answer.\n    print(\"The haiku provides clues for a simple math problem.\")\n    print(f\"The starting number comes from 'Twice fifteen': {2} * {15} = {start_number}\")\n    print(f\"A number to subtract comes from 'An August tempest', as August is the 8th month: {first_subtraction}\")\n    print(f\"Another number to subtract comes from 'A divine one yields': {second_subtraction}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{2} * {15} - {first_subtraction} - {second_subtraction} = {final_number}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe resulting number, {final_number}, corresponds to a letter in the alphabet.\")\n    print(f\"The {final_number}st letter of the alphabet is '{final_letter}'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis letter answers the title's question, 'The Bays', because bays are often U-shaped.\")\n\nsolve_haiku_riddle()\n```\n<<<U>>>"
