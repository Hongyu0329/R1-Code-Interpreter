    # Statement I Analysis
    print("\nOption I: 'Vaping is a better option for her son than cigarettes. It is ok for him to continue vaping, as long as he is trying to cut down.'")
    print("Analysis: This is incorrect. The goal for adolescents is zero nicotine use. Endorsing vaping, which is highly addictive and has unknown long-term effects on youth, is inappropriate counseling.")

    # Statement II Analysis
    print("\nOption II: 'It would be good for her son to start using nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges instead of vaping.'")
    print("Analysis: This is a good recommendation. It suggests replacing an unregulated, appealing nicotine delivery system (vape) with a medically approved, safer, and more controlled Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) as a tool for cessation.")

    # Statement III Analysis
    print("\nOption III: 'Vaping’s risks and benefits are well understood in adults, but not in children, so her son should not vape at all.'")
    print("Analysis: This is an excellent and crucial counseling point. It correctly highlights the unknown dangers for adolescents and establishes the primary goal: complete cessation. It helps the mother understand why her positive experience as an adult smoker does not translate to her son.")

    # Statement IV Analysis
    print("\nOption IV: 'Vaping’s risks and benefits remain poorly understood in children, but it has been shown vaping has clear benefits over cigarettes in children.'")
    print("Analysis: This is incorrect. Claiming 'clear benefits' for children is a dangerous misrepresentation. The goal is not to switch one harmful habit for another; it is to stop all nicotine and tobacco use.")
    
    # Statement V Analysis
    print("\nOption V: 'Consider initiating bupropion and varenicline depending on her son’s needs.'")
    print("Analysis: This is a plausible option for a medical provider to consider, as these are effective prescription medications. However, as an initial counseling point for the mother, suggesting more accessible options like NRT (Option II) is often a better first step.")

    # Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion: The best counseling approach combines the clear goal from Statement III with the practical tool from Statement II.")
    print("The ideal advice is that the son should not vape at all (III) and should consider using NRT products to help him quit (II).")
