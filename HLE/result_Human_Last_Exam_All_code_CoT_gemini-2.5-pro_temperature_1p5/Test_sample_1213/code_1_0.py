def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes a specific Go problem to find the killing move for White.

    The problem involves a classic life-and-death situation (tsumego). Instead of
    building a full Go engine, this solution uses logical deduction based on the
    principles of the game to identify the vital point and the correct sequence of moves.

    The Black group's potential eye shape is centered around the points A1, B1, B2, and A3.
    A direct attack on this eye space is necessary.

    - Moves like W@A1, W@B1, or W@A3 allow Black to respond at B2, connecting the
      stones into a large group that can easily make two eyes and live.
    - The correct move is a tesuji (clever play) at B2. This move is a sacrifice
      that forces Black into a sequence of moves that destroys its own eye shape,
      leaving the entire group with only one eye.

    The killing sequence is as follows:
    1. W at B2 (throw-in)
    2. B at B1 (forced capture)
    3. W at B2 (places the corner in atari)
    4. B at A1 (forced save, creating one eye)
    5. W at A3 (removes all other eye potential)

    Therefore, the only move that initiates a kill sequence is B2.

    # List of moves for White that initiate a kill sequence.
    # Based on the analysis, only one move is correct.
    killing_moves = ["B2"]

    # Format the output string as a comma-delimited list in curly brackets.
