def find_correct_statements():
    """
    This function identifies the correct statements about multichannel quantum scattering.

    Based on the principles of scattering theory:
    - Statement 1 is correct because a trivially coupled potential (diagonalizable by a constant matrix) leads to a trivially coupled S-matrix. The contrapositive holds.
    - Statement 5 is correct based on known results from inverse scattering theory, where nontrivially coupled potentials can be constructed to have diagonal Jost matrices.
    - Statement 3 is incorrect because Statement 5 provides a direct counterexample.
    - Statement 2 is incorrect because the counterexample from Statement 5 (V_nontrivial -> F_diagonal -> S_diagonal) shows a diagonal S-matrix can arise from a nontrivially coupled potential.
    - Statement 4 is incorrect because it is mathematically possible for a non-diagonal Jost matrix F(E) to produce a diagonal S-matrix if its elements satisfy certain algebraic conditions.
