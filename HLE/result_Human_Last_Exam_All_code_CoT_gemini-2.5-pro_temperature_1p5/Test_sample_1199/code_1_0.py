# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the first virtual call's optimization potential.
# 2. Analyze the second virtual call, considering the effect of `escape(a)`.
# 3. Analyze the third virtual call, considering the effect of placement new.
# 4. Sum the number of required v-table loads for the final answer.

# --- Analysis ---

# Call 1: a->foo()
# Immediately after `new A()`, the compiler has definitive proof that the dynamic type of `*a` is `A`.
# A "perfectly optimizing" compiler will use this information to perform devirtualization,
# converting the virtual call into a direct call to `A::foo()`. A direct call does not load the v-table.
loads_call_1 = 0
print(f"Loads for first call (a->foo()): {loads_call_1}")

# Call 2: a->foo()
# The `escape(a)` function is an optimization barrier. The compiler must assume the dynamic type
# of `*a` could have changed to anything. It has no special knowledge.
# Therefore, it must perform a standard virtual dispatch, which requires loading the v-table.
loads_call_2 = 1
print(f"Loads for second call (a->foo()): {loads_call_2}")

# Call 3: b->foo()
# The placement new expression `new(a) B` explicitly constructs a `B` object at the given address.
# The compiler knows with certainty that the dynamic type of `*b` is now `B`.
# It will devirtualize this call to a direct call to `B::foo()`, avoiding a v-table load.
loads_call_3 = 0
print(f"Loads for third call (b->foo()): {loads_call_3}")

# --- Total ---
total_loads = loads_call_1 + loads_call_2 + loads_call_3
print(f"\nTotal virtual table loads = {loads_call_1} + {loads_call_2} + {loads_call_3} = {total_loads}")
