# Plan: Calculate the number of non-Clifford gates based on the overhead from
# magic state distillation, a critical process in topological quantum computing.

# serves as a proxy for the required fidelity of the operation.

# requires a basic level of error correction, corresponding to one level of distillation.

# --- Scenario 2: d=5 code ("implemention") ---
# A distance-5 code is more robust and suggests a more demanding task.
# We assume this "implementation" requires a higher-fidelity gate, corresponding
# to two levels of distillation.
