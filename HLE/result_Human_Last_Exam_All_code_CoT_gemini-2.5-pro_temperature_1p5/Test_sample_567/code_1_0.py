# The problem asks for the value of 'a' where the symplectic embedding capacity c(a)
# of the ellipsoid E(1,a) into a ball is determined solely by the volume constraint.
#
# The volume constraint requires the capacity c(a) to be at least sqrt(a).
# The question is: for what value of 'a' is c(a) = sqrt(a)?
#
# A known theorem in symplectic geometry states that this equality holds if and only if
# 'a' is a perfect square (a = m^2 for an integer m).
#
# This gives infinitely many solutions (e.g., a = 1, 4, 9, ...). However, the case a=1 is unique.
# When a=1, the ellipsoid E(1,1) is a ball. The embedding of a ball into another ball
# is only restricted by their radii, which is directly equivalent to the volume constraint.
# For any other perfect square, the reason is a much deeper, non-obvious cancellation
# of infinitely many other geometric obstructions.
#
# Thus, a=1 is the most fundamental answer.

# We set m=1 to get the fundamental case a = m^2.
m = 1
a = m**2
