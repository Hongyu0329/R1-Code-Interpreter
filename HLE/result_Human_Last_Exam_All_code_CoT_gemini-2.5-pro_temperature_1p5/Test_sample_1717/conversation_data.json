    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\nNext, I will find the formula the game uses to scale boss health based on the number of players in Expert Mode.\nThe user's request for an \"infinite number of players\" would mathematically result in infinite health. However, the prompt specifies to solve this \"according to the source code\". The Terraria source code has a hard-coded limit on the number of players it can handle for these calculations. This limit is 255. Therefore, the \"theoretical maximum health\" is the value calculated with the maximum number of players the game engine supports.\nFinally, I will write a Python script that uses these values (base health, scaling factor, and maximum players) to calculate the theoretical maximum health and print out the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_terraria_boss_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n    According to the Terraria source code:\n    1. The base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is 3640.\n    2. Boss health scales with the number of players. The formula is:\n       Total Health = Base Health * (1 + 0.35 * (Number of Players - 1))\n    3. The \"theoretical maximum\" based on the source code is limited by the maximum\n       number of players the game engine supports, which is 255.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Base health of Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health = 3640\n    \n    # The maximum number of players supported by the Terraria engine.\n    num_players = 255\n    \n    # The health scaling factor per additional player in Expert Mode.\n    scaling_factor = 0.35\n    \n    # The number of players beyond the first who contribute to health scaling.\n    additional_players = num_players - 1\n    \n    # Calculate the total health using the game's formula.\n    total_health = base_health * (1 + scaling_factor * additional_players)\n\n    # Print the equation with all the numbers filled in.\n    print(f\"Base Health * (1 + Scaling Factor * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    print(f\"{base_health} * (1 + {scaling_factor} * ({num_players} - 1)) = {int(total_health)}\")\n\ncalculate_terraria_boss_health()\n```\n<<<327236>>>"
