# This script calculates the numerical coefficient of the scalar curvature R in the
# second term of the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor.

# 1. The Lichnerowicz-Weitzenboeck formula shows that the square of the Dirac
#    operator D^2 contains a term proportional to the scalar curvature R.
#    The coefficient of R*I in the formula for D^2 is 1/4.
coeff_weitzenboeck = Fraction(1, 4)

# 2. The universal formula for the second Seeley-DeWitt heat kernel coefficient
#    (a_2) for an operator of the form -Delta + Q has a term (1/6)*R.
coeff_heat_kernel = Fraction(1, 6)

# 3. The total coefficient for R inside the trace is the sum of these two parts.
#    The gauge field part of the operator has zero trace over spinor indices
#    and does not contribute to this coefficient.
total_coeff_in_trace_R = coeff_weitzenboeck + coeff_heat_kernel

# 4. To get the coefficient in the final action, we must perform the trace
#    over the spinor space. The trace of the identity is the dimension of
#    the spinor space, which is 4 in 4 dimensions.
spinor_dim = 4

# 5. The final coefficient is the product of the coefficient within the trace
#    and the dimension of the spinor space.
#    Note: This result would be further multiplied by the dimension of the gauge group
#    representation, but as that is not specified, we compute the base numerical value.
final_coeff = total_coeff_in_trace_R * spinor_dim
