    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x^5+4x^4+4x^3+x^2+8x$ over the prime $p=2$, we need to find a \"minimal model\" of the curve and analyze its reduction. The number of double points, or nodes, is an invariant of the stable reduction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Model:** The given equation is $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. Reducing this equation modulo 2 gives $\\bar{y}^2 = \\bar{x}^2$, or $(\\bar{y}-\\bar{x})^2 = 0$. This represents a \"double line,\" which is a highly singular reduction and not stable.\n\n2.  **Find a Better Model (First Transformation):** To resolve this singularity, we can perform a change of variables. Notice that $y^2 - x^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$, which is divisible by 4. Since the reduction mod 2 implies $y \\equiv x \\pmod 2$, we can define a new integer variable $Y = (y-x)/2$. Substituting $y = 2Y+x$ into the original equation gives us a new model.\n\n3.  **Find the Minimal Model (Second Transformation):** The new model might still not be minimal. We will analyze its equation and apply further transformations of the form $x \\to 2X$, $Y \\to 2W$ to find a model that is minimal at $p=2$. A key invariant for minimality is the valuation of the discriminant of the curve's equation at $p=2$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stable Reduction Type:** Once we have a minimal model, we can determine the type of stable reduction. The theory of reduction for hyperelliptic curves (in this case, of genus 2) provides a classification based on the invariants of the minimal model. This classification tells us the geometric form of the stable reduction, including the number of its components and its double points.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We will use the properties of our minimal model to identify the structure of the stable reduction and count its double points.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step reasoning and derive the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points\n    in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define variables\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n\n    # Step 1: Initial Equation\n    f_orig = 8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 8*x\n    curve_orig = sympy.Eq(y**2, f_orig)\n    print(\"Step 1: The original curve equation is:\")\n    print(f\"y**2 = {f_orig}\")\n    print(\"\\nReducing modulo 2, we get y**2 = x**2, or (y-x)**2 = 0.\")\n    print(\"This is a 'double line', which is an unstable reduction.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: First Transformation\n    # We introduce Y = (y-x)/2, so y = 2Y+x\n    Y = sympy.symbols('Y')\n    curve_step2_lhs = (2*Y + x)**2\n    curve_step2_rhs = f_orig\n    # Expand and simplify\n    # 4*Y**2 + 4*Y*x + x**2 = 8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 8*x\n    # 4*Y**2 + 4*Y*x = 8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + 8*x\n    # Y**2 + Y*x = 2*x**5 + x**4 + x**3 + 2*x\n    f_step2 = 2*x**5 + x**4 + x**3 + 2*x\n    curve_step2 = sympy.Eq(Y**2 + Y*x, f_step2)\n    print(\"Step 2: We apply the transformation y = 2*Y + x.\")\n    print(\"The new model of the curve is:\")\n    print(f\"{curve_step2.lhs} = {curve_step2.rhs}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe reduction of this model mod 2 is Y**2 + Y*x + x**4 + x**3 = 0.\")\n    print(\"This curve factors into two parabolas that intersect at one point (a node).\")\n    print(\"However, the arithmetic genus of this reduction is 0, but the curve's genus is 2.
