# The problem is a classic in combinatorial geometry (Putnam 1960, B-6).
# The solution comes from a specific configuration of 5 points.
# The largest possible value for r is given by the formula:
# r = 1 / (2 * cos(18 degrees))

# The numbers in the final equation are 1, 2, and 18.
num1 = 1
num2 = 2
angle_deg = 18

# Calculate the value of r
# Convert degrees to radians for Python's math functions
angle_rad = math.radians(angle_deg)
cos_val = math.cos(angle_rad)
r_value = num1 / (num2 * cos_val)

# Output the result
print("The problem asks for the largest real number r for a specific arrangement of 5 points in a unit square.")
