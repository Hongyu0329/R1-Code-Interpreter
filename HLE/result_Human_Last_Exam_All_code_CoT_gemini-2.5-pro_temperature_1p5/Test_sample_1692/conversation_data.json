    "To solve this problem, we need to find an elementary cellular automaton rule (a number from 0 to 255) and a binary sequence for the intermediate step that connects the given top row to the given bottom row. Since the rule is unknown, we will test every possibility.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Iterate through all 256 possible rules** of elementary cellular automata.\n2.  For each rule, perform a two-step evolution:\n    a.  First, apply the rule to the initial row (`01101001`) to generate a candidate for the intermediate row. We will assume periodic boundary conditions, which is standard practice (the grid wraps around).\n    b.  Second, apply the same rule to this newly generated intermediate row.\n3.  **Compare the result** of the second step with the given final row (`10000111`).\n4.  If they match, we have found the correct rule and the unique intermediate row. The problem statement guarantees that there is only one valid solution.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 2-step elementary cellular automaton evolution\n    by testing all possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    top_row_str = \"01101001\"\n    bottom_row_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    top_row = [int(c) for c in top_row_str]\n    bottom_row = [int(c) for c in bottom_row_str]\n    n = len(top_row)\n    \n    solution_found = False\n\n    # 1.
