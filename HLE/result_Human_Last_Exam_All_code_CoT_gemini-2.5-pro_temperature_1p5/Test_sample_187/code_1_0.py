    Identifies the line numbers in the provided triangle.py file that contain programming errors

    The errors identified are:
    1. Use of `^` (bitwise XOR) for exponentiation instead of `**`. This affects lines 11, 29, 30, 31.
    2. Use of `/` (float division) for integer division where a precise rational number is expected.
