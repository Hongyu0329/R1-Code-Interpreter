    "To solve the definite integral $I=\\int_0^{\\pi}{(\\csc x)(\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x})}dx$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the integrand**: The term $\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$ can be simplified using trigonometric identities. I will show that it is equal to $\\arctan(\\sin x)$.\n2.  **Rewrite the Integral**: The integral becomes $I = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\csc(x) \\arctan(\\sin x) dx$.\n3.  **Use Feynman's Trick (Leibniz Integral Rule)**: This is a powerful technique for solving definite integrals. I will introduce a parameter '$a$' into the integral, creating a function $I(a) = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\csc(x) \\arctan(a \\sin x) dx$. The original integral is $I(1)$.\n4.  **Differentiate with respect to the parameter**: I'll compute the derivative $I'(a) = \\frac{dI}{da}$. This will result in a simpler integral.\n5.  **Evaluate the new integral**: The integral for $I'(a)$ will be evaluated.\n6.  **Integrate the result**: I'll integrate $I'(a)$ with respect to '$a$' from $0$ to $1$ to find the value of $I(1) = I$.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan using the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic mathematics.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the definite integral I = ∫[0,π] csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2)) dx\n    using symbolic mathematics with sympy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols\n    x = sp.Symbol('x')\n    a = sp.Symbol('a')\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Simplify the integrand and rewrite the integral ---\n    # The term arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2)) simplifies to arctan(sin(x)).\n    # Let's briefly show why:\n    # Let y = arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2)).
