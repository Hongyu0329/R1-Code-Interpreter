    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the linguistic changes from Proto-Indo-European to the various Germanic languages, followed by the code to present the results.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form:** The provided PIE verb is `*seh₂gieti`. We'll focus on the root `*seh₂g-`.\n2.  **Apply Grimm's Law:** This set of sound changes differentiates Proto-Germanic (PGmc) from PIE. The PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the PGmc voiceless stop `*k`. The laryngeal `*h₂` colors the preceding `*e` vowel to `*a` and then disappears, creating a long vowel. So, `*seh₂g-` becomes `*sāk-`.\n3.  **Proto-Germanic Vowel Shift:** In Proto-Germanic, PIE `*ā` becomes `*ō`. Therefore, the root becomes `*sōk-`.\n4.  **Reconstruct the Proto-Germanic Verb:** The PIE suffix `*-ie-` forms a Class 1 weak verb in Proto-Germanic, with the suffix `*-ja-`. The infinitive form is `*sōkijaną`. The meaning shifts from 'to follow a sign' to 'to seek'.\n5.  **Trace to Daughter Languages:**\n    *   **Old Norse (ON):** The `*j` in `*sōkijaną` causes i-umlaut, changing the root vowel `*ō` to `*œ` (often written `ǿ`). The result is `sœkja`.\n    *   **Old English (OE):** I-umlaut also occurs, changing `*ō` to `*ē`. The `*k` followed by `*j` is palatalized to `[tʃ]` (spelled `ċ`). The `*j` is then lost. This results in `sēċan` (to seek).\n    *   **Old High German (OHG):** Proto-Germanic `*ō` becomes `uo`. The High German Consonant Shift changes PGmc `*k` to the voiceless fricative `hh` (`[xx]`). This gives `suohhen`.\n\nThis entire derivation will be presented clearly in the Python script's output.\n\n```python\ndef solve_linguistic_derivation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function traces the derivation of a Proto-Indo-European root\n    through Proto-Germanic into its daughter languages and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    pie_form = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    pie_meaning = \"'(s)he gives a sign, tracks'\"\n    \n    pgmc_form = \"*sōkijaną\"\n    on_form = \"sœkja\"\n    oe_form = \"sēcan\"\n    ohg_form = \"suohhen\"\n    \n    print(\"This shows the derivation of a PIE root into the early Germanic languages.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"1.
