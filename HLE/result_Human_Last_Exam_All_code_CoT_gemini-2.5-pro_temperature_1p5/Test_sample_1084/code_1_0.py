    This function determines the truthfulness of six statements about graph properties.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    Let A be the number of 4-cycles (more precisely, injective homomorphisms from C4) and
    B be the number of C6' subgraphs (a 6-cycle with a chord between antipodal vertices).
    The graph is d-regular on n vertices.

    1. We establish an asymptotic relationship between A and B by considering a family of graphs,
       for instance, Cayley graphs of Z_n or random d-regular graphs.
       - A can be estimated by counting pairs of paths of length 2 between the same two vertices.
         This typically yields A = Theta(n * d^3) in many graph families.
       - B can be estimated by counting pairs of disjoint paths of length 3 between two connected vertices.
         This typically yields B = Theta(n * d^4).
       - This suggests a general relationship A = Theta(B/d).

    2. We test each statement against this derived relationship A ~ B/d. A statement is
       false if we can find a family of graphs for which it does not hold.
       Using A ~ n*d^3 and B ~ n*d^4:

       - Statement 1: A = O(B/d^0.5 + nd^2) -> n*d^3 = O(n*d^4/d^0.5) = O(n*d^3.5). This is true.
       - Statement 2: A = O(B/d^0.99 + nd^2) -> n*d^3 = O(n*d^4/d^0.99) = O(n*d^3.01). This is true.
       - Statement 3: A = O(B/d + nd^2) -> n*d^3 = O(n*d^4/d) = O(n*d^3). This is true.
       - Statement 4: A = O(B/d^1.5 + nd^2) -> n*d^3 = O(n*d^4/d^1.5) = O(n*d^2.5). This is false for large d.
       - Statement 5: A = O(B/d^1.3 + n*d^2.6) -> n*d^3 = O(n*d^4/d^1.3) = O(n*d^2.7). This is false for large d.
    
    3. We check the additive term. The term nd^2 is proportional to the number of paths of length 2,
       which is a natural 'base' quantity for A (number of C4s), since a C4 is formed by two
       such paths sharing endpoints. It is known that A can be O(nd^2) in some graphs while B is small or zero.
       - Statement 6: A = O(B/d + n*d^1.5). If we hypothesize a graph where B=0 and A = Theta(n*d^2),
         this statement becomes n*d^2 = O(n*d^1.5), which is false. This makes statement 6 likely false in general.
         The additive term in (3) is more appropriate.

    So, statements 1, 2, 3 are True ('Y'), and 4, 5, 6 are False ('N').
