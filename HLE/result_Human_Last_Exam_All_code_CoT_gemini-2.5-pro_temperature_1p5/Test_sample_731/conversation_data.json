    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python script that carries out the calculation and prints the result.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Request**: The goal is to find the number of \"power subgroups\" in the semidihedral group of order 512. A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n\n2.  **Identify the Group**: The semidihedral group of order 512 is denoted as SD_512 or SD_9, as 512 = 2^9. Its structure is given by the presentation:\n    SD_9 = <r, s | r^(2^(9-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(9-2)-1)>\n    SD_9 = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>\n\n3.  **Method for Counting Cyclic Subgroups**: A standard method is to first count the number of elements of each possible order `d` in the group. Let's call this count `N(d)`. The number of distinct cyclic subgroups of a specific order `d` is then given by `N(d) / φ(d)`, where `φ` is Euler's totient function. The total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of these values over all possible orders `d`.\n\n4.  **Determine Element Orders**: The elements of SD_9 are of two forms:\n    *   **Elements of the form `r^i`**: These form a cyclic subgroup `<r>` of order 256. For any divisor `d` of 256, there are exactly `φ(d)` elements of order `d` in this subgroup.\n    *   **Elements of the form `r^i * s`**: There are 256 such elements. We can determine their orders:\n        *   If `i` is even, the element `r^i * s` has order 2. There are 128 even values for `i` (0, 2, ..., 254).\n        *   If `i` is odd, the element `r^i * s` has order 4. There are 128 odd values for `i` (1, 3, ..., 255).\n\n5.  **Calculate and Sum**:\n    *   Combine the counts to find the total number of elements `N(d)` for each possible order `d`. The possible orders are powers of 2.\n    *   For each order `d`, calculate the number of subgroups: `N(d) / φ(d)`.\n    *   Sum these counts to get the total number of power subgroups.\n\n6.  **Implement in Python**: Write a script to perform these calculations, display the breakdown for each order, print the final summation, and output the total count.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    For n=2^k, phi(n) = n / 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Check if n is a power of 2, which is true for all our orders > 1\n    if n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0:\n        return n // 2\n    # A general implementation is not strictly necessary here but included for completeness.\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\n# The semidihedral group is SD_n of order 2^n.\n# Order = 512 = 2^9, so n = 9.\nn = 9\n\n# N(d): A dictionary to store the number of elements of order d.\nN = {}\n\n# Step 1: Count elements from the cyclic subgroup <r> of order 2^(n-1) = 256.\n# For each divisor d of 256 (i.e., d=2^k for k=0..8), there are phi(d) elements of order d.\nfor k in range(n): # k from 0 to 8\n    d = 2**k\n    N[d] = phi(d)\n\n# Step 2: Add elements of the form r^i * s.\n# There are 2^(n-2) = 128 elements of order 2 (where i is even).\n# There are 2^(n-2) = 128 elements of order 4 (where i is odd).\nnum_s_type_half = 2**(n - 2)\n\n# Add 128 elements to the count for order 2\nN[2] += num_s_type_half\n# Add 128 elements to the count for order 4\nN[4] += num_s_type_half\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of subgroups for each order and the total.\nsubgroup_counts_per_order = []\ntotal_subgroups = 0\n\norders = sorted(N.keys())\n\nprint(\"The number of power subgroups is the sum of the number of cyclic subgroups of each possible order.\")\nprint(\"Number of subgroups of order d = (Number of elements of order d) / phi(d)\\n\")\n\nfor d in orders:\n    elements_of_order_d = N[d]\n    phi_d = phi(d)\n    subgroups_of_order_d = elements_of_order_d // phi_d\n    \n    subgroup_counts_per_order.append(subgroups_of_order_d)\n    \n    print(f\"Order d={d}:\")\n    print(f\"  Number of elements = {elements_of_order_d}\")\n    print(f\"  phi({d}) = {phi_d}\")\n    print(f\"  Number of subgroups = {elements_of_order_d} / {phi_d} = {subgroups_of_order_d}\\n\")\n    \ntotal_subgroups = sum(subgroup_counts_per_order)\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation and result, as requested.\nequation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, subgroup_counts_per_order))\nprint(f\"The final calculation is the sum of the number of subgroups for each order:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the total number of power subgroups is:\")\nprint(total_subgroups)\n```\n<<<201>>>"
