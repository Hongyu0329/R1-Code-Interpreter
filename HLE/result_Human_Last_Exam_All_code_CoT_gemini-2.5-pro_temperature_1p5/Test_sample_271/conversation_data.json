    "Here is a plan to determine the possible degrees of the intermediate normal field extensions:\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial**: The first step is to simplify the polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ by finding its factors.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: We'll find the Galois group of the splitting field $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This involves analyzing the Galois groups of the factors and how they combine. This step is crucial as it dictates the structure of all subfields.\n3.  **Apply Galois Theory**: The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory establishes a one-to-one correspondence between intermediate fields of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ and subgroups of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ correspond to normal subgroups of $G$.\n4.  **Find Normal Subgroups and Degrees**: We will identify all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of a normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the index of its corresponding normal subgroup in $G$.\n5.  **List the Degrees**: We will collect all possible degrees calculated in the previous step.\n\nThe following Python script will walk through these steps, explain the reasoning, perform necessary calculations, and print the final list of possible degrees.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding all possible degrees of intermediate normal\n    field extensions for the splitting field of P(x) over Q.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the polynomial P(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6.\")\n    print(\"By inspection, we can factor the polynomial.
