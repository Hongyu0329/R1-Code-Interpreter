# Parameters from the problem description
# The defect group D is elementary abelian of order 16.
# This is isomorphic to a 4-dimensional vector space over the field F_2.
n = 4  # dimension of the vector space
p = 2  # size of the field (from characteristic two)

# The highest possible order for the inertial quotient E is the order of
# the general linear group GL(n, F_p), which is Aut(D).
# The formula for |GL(n, p)| is (p^n - p^0) * (p^n - p^1) * ... * (p^n - p^(n-1)).

# Calculate the individual terms of the product
term1 = p**n - p**0  # 16 - 1
term2 = p**n - p**1  # 16 - 2
term3 = p**n - p**2  # 16 - 4
term4 = p**n - p**3  # 16 - 8

# Calculate the final result
highest_order = term1 * term2 * term3 * term4

# Print the final equation with all numbers, as requested
print("The highest possible order for E is |GL(4, F_2)|.")
print("The calculation is the product of the number of choices for each basis vector.")
print(f"The equation is: {term1} * {term2} * {term3} * {term4} = {highest_order}")
print(f"Thus, the highest possible order that E can have is {highest_order}.")
