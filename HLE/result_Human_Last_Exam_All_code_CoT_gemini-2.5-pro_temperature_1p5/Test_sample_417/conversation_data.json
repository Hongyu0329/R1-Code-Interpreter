    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C3 rotational axis passing through the center of the central benzene ring. This means the three large substituents attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent, as are the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton environments within one of the three identical arms and the unique protons on the central core.\n2.  **Count Peaks from the Central Core:** The central core is a 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexasubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal.\n3.  **Count Peaks from One of the Three Identical Arms:** Each arm consists of a methylene (`-CH2-`) linker and a chiral camphor-derived indazole group.\n    *   **Methylene Linker:** The two protons on the `-CH2-` group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center (the entire indazole unit). This means they are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two separate signals.\n    *   **Camphor-Indazole Unit:** This is a rigid, chiral moiety with no internal symmetry. All its protons and methyl groups will be in unique chemical environments. We count them as follows:\n        *   One proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole ring.\n        *   One proton at the C4 bridgehead.\n        *   Two diastereotopic protons on the C5 methylene group.\n        *   Two diastereotopic protons on the C6 methylene group.\n        *   One methyl group at the C7 bridgehead.\n        *   Two diastereotopic methyl groups at the C8 position (gem-dimethyl bridge).\n4.  **Sum the Peaks:** The total number of peaks is the sum of peaks from the central core and one of the identical arms.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this counting process.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its symmetry and structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Molecule: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the central benzene core.\n    # The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\n    core_methyl_peaks = 1\n    \n    # Step 2: Analyze one of the three identical arms attached to the core.\n    # The arm consists of a methylene linker and a camphor-indazole unit.\n    \n    # The two protons on the methylene (-CH2-) linker are diastereotopic.\n    linker_methylene_peaks = 2\n    \n    # The camphor-indazole unit is chiral and rigid, leading to distinct signals for each non-equivalent proton.\n    # - 1H on the pyrazole ring\n    indazole_pyrazole_H_peaks = 1\n    # - 1H at the bridgehead (C4)\n    indazole_bridgehead_H_peaks = 1\n    # - 2H at the C5 position (diastereotopic)\n    indazole_C5_H_peaks = 2\n    # - 2H at the C6 position (diastereotopic)\n    indazole_C6_H_peaks = 2\n    # - 3H from the methyl group at C7\n    indazole_C7_methyl_peaks = 1\n    # - 6H from the two diastereotopic methyl groups at C8\n    indazole_C8_gem_dimethyl_peaks = 2\n    \n    # Sum the peaks from the indazole unit\n    total_indazole_peaks = (indazole_pyrazole_H_peaks + \n                          indazole_bridgehead_H_peaks + \n                          indazole_C5_H_peaks + \n                          indazole_C6_H_peaks + \n                          indazole_C7_methyl_peaks + \n                          indazole_C8_gem_dimethyl_peaks)\n\n    # Step 3: Sum all the peaks.\n    total_peaks = core_methyl_peaks + linker_methylene_peaks + total_indazole_peaks\n\n    # Print the detailed breakdown of the calculation.\n    print(\"Analysis of expected 1H NMR peaks:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    print(f\"1.
