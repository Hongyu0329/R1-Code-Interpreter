    # A "valid k-vector" corresponds to a "nowhere-zero k-flow". The problem asks for the
    # smallest k, which is the "flow number" phi(G) of the graph G.

    # The flow number for a 3-regular graph depends on its specific structure:
    # 1. phi(G) = 3, if G is bipartite.
    # 2. phi(G) = 4, if G is 3-edge-colorable but not bipartite.
    # 3. phi(G) = 5, if G is not 3-edge-colorable (i.e., G is a "snark").

    # The problem specifies G is a 20-vertex, 3-regular, bridgeless graph.
    # Graphs of all three types above exist with these properties. For example, the Flower
    # Snark J5 is a 20-vertex graph for which the flow number is 5. A bipartite
    # 3-regular graph on 20 vertices also exists, for which the flow number is 3.

    # Since the problem asks for a single value of k that applies to "a" graph G with
    # these properties, we interpret this as finding the smallest k that works for ANY such
    # graph. This is the maximum flow number possible for this class of graphs.

    # requiring k=5 exists in this class, the maximum possible flow number is 5.
