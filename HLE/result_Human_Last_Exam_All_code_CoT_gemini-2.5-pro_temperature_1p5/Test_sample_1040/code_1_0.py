def solve_math_problem():
    """
    This function determines which identities necessarily follow from the given
    algebraic assumptions.

    The problem states:
    Let M be a commutative, idempotent monoid and G an abelian group.
    Let there be an additive monoid action of M on G.
    Let Phi: M -> G satisfy Phi(m1*m2) = Phi(m1) + m1.Phi(m2).
    Let Phi^n be defined inductively by Phi^n(m1;...;mn) = Phi^(n-1)(m1;...;m(n-1)) - mn.Phi^(n-1)(m1;...;m(n-1)).
    Let Psi(k;l;m) = Phi(k) + Phi(l) + Phi(m) - Phi(klm).
    Assume Psi(k;l;m) = 0 for some k,l,m.

    Based on a step-by-step derivation:
    - Options 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 are proven false by counterexample.
    - Option 6 is proven true by leveraging the symmetry of Psi.
    - Option 10 is proven true using a key consequence of the symmetry of Psi, which is Phi^2(x;y) = Phi^2(y;x) for x,y in {k,l,m}.
    - Options 7, 8, 11, 12 are proven to be tautologies within the given algebraic structure (they are always true, regardless of the assumption), and therefore they necessarily follow.

    The correct identities are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12.
