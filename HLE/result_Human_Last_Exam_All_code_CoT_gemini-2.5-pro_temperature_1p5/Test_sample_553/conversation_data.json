    "This is a music theory question that can be solved by analyzing the chord progressions of The Beatles' songs. The most famous song that fits this description, despite a slight imprecision in the technical music theory term, is \"Help!\".\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will identify the song \"Help!\" as the most likely answer.\n2.  I will determine the key of the song, which is A major.\n3.  The tonic chord (I) in the key of A major is A major.\n4.  The chord progression at the start of the song features a dramatic jump from this A major tonic chord to a series of minor chords that create a sense of urgency and distress.\n5.  I will explain that while the progression is not technically to the \"minor fifth\" (v) chord, it is the most iconic example of this type of harmonic shift in the band's work, matching the spirit of the question. The code will print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_beatles_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a music theory description\n    and prints the analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Help!\"\n    key = \"A Major\"\n    tonic_chord_name = \"A Major\"\n    tonic_chord_numeral = \"I\"\n    following_chord_name = \"F# minor\"\n    following_chord_numeral = \"vi\"\n    actual_minor_fifth_name = \"E minor\"\n    actual_minor_fifth_numeral = \"v\"\n\n    print(\"The Beatles song that famously starts with a chord jump from the tonic to a minor harmony is 'Help!'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the musical breakdown:\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(f\"It starts with the first word, 'Help!', sung over the powerful tonic chord: {tonic_chord_name} (the '{tonic_chord_numeral}' chord).\")\n    print(f\"The harmony then makes a dramatic 'jump' to a descending progression, with the first main change being to {following_chord_name} (the '{following_chord_numeral}' chord).\")\n    print(f\"This immediate shift from the strong major tonic to a sadder-sounding minor chord is a defining feature of the song's opening.\")\n    print(f\"\\nNote: While the jump is not to the technical 'minor fifth' chord ({actual_minor_fifth_name}, the '{actual_minor_fifth_numeral}' chord), this is the most famous example that fits the description.\")\n\nsolve_beatles_riddle()\n```\n<<<Help!>>>"
