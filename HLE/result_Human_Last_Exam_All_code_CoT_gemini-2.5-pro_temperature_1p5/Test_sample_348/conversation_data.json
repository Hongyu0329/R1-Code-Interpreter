    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Functions**: First, we will define the given supply `P_S(Q) = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and demand `P_D(Q) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions in Python.\n\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: The market equilibrium occurs where supply equals demand (`P_S(Q) = P_D(Q)`). We will find the equilibrium quantity `Q_e` by numerically solving the equation `ln(Q^3 - 2) - 18 * e^(-arctan(Q)) = 0`. Once `Q_e` is found, the equilibrium price `P_e` can be calculated by substituting `Q_e` into either function.\n\n3.  **Determine Integration Limits**:\n    *   The demand curve is defined for `Q >= 0`.\n    *   The supply curve `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined when `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. Let's call this minimum quantity `Q_min`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: Total Welfare (TW) is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS). It can be calculated by finding the area between the demand and supply curves.\n    *   **Total Value to Consumers**: This is the integral of the demand curve from 0 to `Q_e`. `∫[0 to Q_e] P_D(Q) dQ`.\n    *   **Total Cost to Producers**: This is the integral of the supply curve over the range it's defined, from `Q_min` to `Q_e`. `∫[Q_min to Q_e] P_S(Q) dQ`.\n    *   **Total Welfare Formula**: `TW = ∫[0 to Q_e] P_D(Q) dQ - ∫[Q_min to Q_e] P_S(Q) dQ`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Code**: We will use Python's `scipy` library to perform the numerical root-finding (`fsolve`) and integration (`quad`). The code will calculate all the necessary components and print the final equation with the computed values.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# 1. Define the supply and demand functions\ndef demand_P(Q):\n    \"\"\"Demand function P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q))\n\ndef supply_P(Q):\n    \"\"\"Supply function P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n    # Use np.maximum to avoid domain errors during solving\n    # The actual integration will use the correct lower bound.\n    return np.log(np.maximum(Q**3 - 2, 1e-9))\n\n# 2.

Determine the integration limit for the supply curve\n# Supply is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0 => Q > 2^(1/3)\nQ_min = 2**(1/3)\n\n# 4.
