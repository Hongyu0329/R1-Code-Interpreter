    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we will construct the canonical representation, which is a single stalk of red and blue pieces.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Representation:** A dyadic rational number (a fraction with a denominator that is a power of 2) can be uniquely represented by a simple stalk of red and blue pieces in Hackenbush.\n2.  **Construction Algorithm:** We will build this stalk from the ground up, adding one piece at a time.\n    *   We start with an empty stalk, which has a value of 0.\n    *   We then iteratively add pieces to the top. The color of the piece is chosen to move the value of the stalk closer to our target number, $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n    *   If the target value is greater than the current stalk's value, we add a **Blue** piece.\n    *   If the target value is less than the current stalk's value, we add a **Red** piece.\n3.  **Value Calculation:** The value of a stalk is calculated using the rules of surreal numbers. The value is the \"simplest\" number that lies between the values of the game options for the Left player (Blue) and the Right player (Red). For these simple stalks, this is equivalent to $\\{ \\text{max Left options} | \\text{min Right options} \\}$.\n4.  **Execution:** We will use a Python script to automate this construction process. The script will simulate the addition of pieces, calculate the value at each step, and stop once the value equals $\\frac{13}{16}$. The total number of pieces in the resulting stalk is our answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\n# Memoization table to store computed values of stalks for efficiency\nmemo = {(): fractions.Fraction(0)}\n\ndef get_simplest_number(L, R):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the simplest number {max(L)|min(R)}.\n    For the dyadic rationals generated by this stalk construction, this is\n    a known recursive formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_L = max(L) if L else None\n    min_R = min(R) if R else None\n\n    if max_L is None and min_R is None:\n        return fractions.Fraction(0)\n    # { | R } form, e.g., {|0} = -1\n    if max_L is None:\n        return min_R - 1\n    # { L | } form, e.g., {0|} = 1\n    if min_R is None:\n        return max_L + 1\n    \n    # { L | R } form.
