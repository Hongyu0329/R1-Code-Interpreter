    "In tournament poker, this situation (16 big blinds UTG+1 near the money bubble) is a classic \"push-or-fold\" scenario. Your decision should be based on established push/fold charts, which are derived from Game Theory Optimal (GTO) and Independent Chip Model (ICM) calculations. The money bubble adds a layer of complexity: opponents are likely to play tighter to avoid busting, which increases your \"fold equity\" and allows you to profitably shove a slightly wider range of hands than you normally would.\n\nHere is my plan to determine the correct hand to shove:\n1.  Define a standard GTO/ICM-based shoving range for a player with 16bb in an early position (UTG+1) at a 9-handed table, considering the bubble factor. A widely accepted range for this spot is approximately: `66+, ATs+, KJs+, QJs, JTs, AJo+, KQo`.\n2.  Represent the hands from the answer choices: QJs, 99, AJo, and AKo.\n3.  Write a Python script that will systematically check which of these hands fall into the defined shoving range.\n4.  The script will evaluate each hand:\n    *   **Pocket Pairs:** e.g., `66+` means pairs of 6s or higher.\n    *   **Suited Hands:** e.g., `ATs+` means AT-suited, AJ-suited, AQ-suited, and AK-suited.\n    *   **Offsuit Hands:** e.g., `AJo+` means AJ-offsuit, AQ-offsuit, and AK-offsuit.\n5.  The script will print the analysis for each hand, showing which ones are correct shoves. Since GTO strategy often includes multiple hands from the list, the script will then identify the strongest, most premium hand among the correct options as the most likely intended answer for a multiple-choice question.\n\n```python\ndef get_hand_details(hand_str):\n    \"\"\"Parses a hand string like 'AKo' or '99' into its components.\"\"\"\n    if len(hand_str) == 2:\n        # It's a pocket pair\n        return {'type': 'pair', 'rank1': hand_str[0], 'rank2': hand_str[1]}\n    \n    rank1, rank2, suit_info = hand_str[0], hand_str[1], hand_str[2]\n    \n    if suit_info == 's':\n        return {'type': 'suited', 'rank1': rank1, 'rank2': rank2}\n    elif suit_info == 'o':\n        return {'type': 'offsuit', 'rank1': rank1, 'rank2': rank2}\n    return None\n\ndef is_hand_in_range(hand_details, range_components):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a hand falls within a GTO range component like '77+' or 'ATs+'.\"\"\"\n    card_rank = \"23456789TJQKA\"\n    rank1_val = card_rank.find(hand_details['rank1'])\n    \n    for comp in range_components:\n        # Check pairs, e.g., '66+'\n        if hand_details['type'] == 'pair' and len(comp) == 3 and comp.endswith('+'):\n            if hand_details['rank1'] == hand_details['rank2']:\n                min_rank_val = card_rank.find(comp[0])\n                if rank1_val >= min_rank_val:\n                    return True\n        # Check specific pairs, e.g. '99'\n        elif hand_details['type'] == 'pair' and len(comp) == 2:\n            if hand_details['rank1'] == comp[0]:\n                return True\n        \n        # Check suited hands, e.g., 'ATs+' or 'KJs'\n        elif hand_details['type'] == 'suited' and comp.endswith('s'):\n            comp_rank1 = card_rank.find(comp[0])\n            comp_rank2 = card_rank.find(comp[1])\n            hand_rank1 = card_rank.find(hand_details['rank1'])\n            hand_rank2 = card_rank.find(hand_details['rank2'])\n            \n            # For Axs+ type ranges\n            if comp.endswith('s+'):\n                if hand_rank1 == comp_rank1 and hand_rank2 >= comp_rank2:\n                    return True\n            # For specific suited hands\n            elif hand_rank1 == comp_rank1 and hand_rank2 == comp_rank2:\n                return True\n\n        # Check offsuit hands, e.g., 'AJo+' or 'KQo'\n        elif hand_details['type'] == 'offsuit' and comp.endswith('o'):\n            comp_rank1 = card_rank.find(comp[0])\n            comp_rank2 = card_rank.find(comp[1])\n            hand_rank1 = card_rank.find(hand_details['rank1'])\n            hand_rank2 = card_rank.find(hand_details['rank2'])\n            \n            # For Axo+ type ranges\n            if comp.endswith('o+'):\n                if hand_rank1 == comp_rank1 and hand_rank2 >= comp_rank2:\n                    return True\n            # For specific offsuit hands\n            elif hand_rank1 == comp_rank1 and hand_rank2 == comp_rank2:\n                return True\n    return False\n\n# --- Main Program ---\n\n# Situation: 16bb, UTG+1, Near the money bubble\n# GTO Push/Fold range for this spot is roughly: 66+, ATs+, KJs+, QJs, JTs, AJo+, KQo\nshoving_range = ['66+', 'ATs+', 'KJs+', 'QJs', 'JTs', 'AJo+', 'KQo']\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"QJs\",\n    \"B\": \"None of these\",\n    \"C\": \"99\",\n    \"D\": \"AJo\",\n    \"E\": \"AKo\"\n}\n\nprint(f\"Analyzing shove options for 16bb UTG+1 on the bubble...\")\nprint(f\"Based on a standard GTO shoving range of: {', '.join(shoving_range)}\\n\")\n\ncorrect_shoves = []\nfor key, hand in options.items():\n    if key == \"B\":\n        continue\n    \n    # Sort ranks for consistency (e.g., KQs -> QKs is not ideal)\n    ranks = sorted(hand[:2], key=lambda x: \"23456789TJQKA\".find(x), reverse=True)\n    if len(hand) == 3: # Suited or offsuit\n        hand_str = \"\".join(ranks) + hand[2]\n    else: # Pair\n        hand_str = \"\".join(ranks)\n\n    details = get_hand_details(hand_str)\n    \n    if is_hand_in_range(details, shoving_range):\n        result = \"is a profitable shove.\"\n        correct_shoves.append((key, hand))\n    else:\n        result = \"is NOT a standard shove in this spot.\"\n    \n    print(f\"Hand '{hand}': {result}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\nif not correct_shoves:\n    print(\"Based on the defined range, none of the hands are a standard shove.\")\n    # In this specific case we know this isn't true, but it's good practice\nelse:\n    print(\"According to GTO/ICM strategy, multiple hands listed are correct shoves:\")\n    for key, hand in correct_shoves:\n        print(f\"- {hand} ({key})\")\n    \n    # In a quiz, you often have to select the 'best' option.\n    # AKo is the most premium hand on the list.\n    print(\"\\nWhile several options are correct, 'AKo' (E) is the strongest premium hand among them.\")\n    print(\"It dominates other broadway hands and has excellent equity when called.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, it is the most standard and non-debatable shove.\")\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
