# The squared mass of the five degrees of freedom is m^2.
# Let's define the value m^2 symbolically for our equation.
m_squared = "m^2"

# Our derivation shows that the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom (M_6^2)
# is -1 times m^2.
coefficient = -1

# The final equation for the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom is:
# M_6^2 = coefficient * m^2
print(f"The equation for the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom (M_6^2) is:")
print(f"M_6^2 = ({coefficient}) * {m_squared}")

# The numbers in the final equation are -1 and 2 (from m^2).
print(f"The numerical coefficient is: {coefficient}")
