    "To find the value of K, we need to determine the slice rank of the given tensor and then compare it to the provided asymptotic formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the tensor**: The function $f(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$ for $(x, y, z) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ defines the entries of a tensor $T_n$ in the space $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n}$ where $V = \\mathbb{C}^2$.\n2.  **Calculate the slice rank**: The slice rank of a tensor is the smallest number of \"slice\" tensors that sum up to it. We can calculate the slice rank of $T_n$ by finding the dimension of the space spanned by its matrix slices. Let's consider the slices along the first mode. For each $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$, we get a matrix slice $M_x(y,z) = T_n(x,y,z)$.\n3.  **Show linear independence**: The slice rank along the first mode, denoted $SR_1(T_n)$, is the dimension of the span of these $2^n$ matrices. We will show that these matrices are linearly independent, which implies that $SR_1(T_n) = 2^n$.\n4.  **Determine the overall slice rank**: By the symmetry of the tensor $T_n$ with respect to its three modes, the slice ranks along the other modes are also $2^n$. Therefore, the slice rank of $T_n$ is $2^n$.\n5.  **Solve for K**: We are given that the slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. By equating this with our calculated slice rank, $2^n$, we can solve for $K$.\n    $2^n = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$\n    Taking the n-th root and the limit as $n \\to \\infty$, we get:\n    $2 = 3/2^K$\n    $2^{K+1} = 3$\n    $K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n    $K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\n6.  **Final code**: The Python code will compute this value of K and display the steps of the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: The problem is to find K from the slice rank expression.\n# The slice rank is given as (3/2^K)^n * e^(o(n)).\n# Our analysis shows that the slice rank of the tensor is exactly 2^n.\n\n# Step 2: Equate the two expressions for the slice rank.\n# 2^n = (3 / (2^K))^n * e^(o(n))\n# Taking the n-th root of both sides and letting n -> infinity, we get:\n# 2 = 3 / (2^K)\n\n# Step 3: Solve the equation for K.\n# 2 * 2^K = 3\n# 2^(K+1) = 3\n# K + 1 = log2(3)\n# K = log2(3) - 1\n\n# The code below calculates and prints the value of K.\n\n# The numbers in the final equation K = log2(3) - 1 are K, 2, 3, and 1.\nlog_3_base_2 = math.log2(3)\none = 1\nK = log_3_base_2 - one\n\nprint(\"The final equation for K is: K = log\\u2082(3) - 1\")\nprint(f\"We compute the values: log\\u2082(3) = {log_3_base_2}, and 1 = {one}\")\nprint(f\"So, K = {log_3_base_2} - {one}\")\nprint(f\"The value of K is: {K}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.5849625007211563>>>"
