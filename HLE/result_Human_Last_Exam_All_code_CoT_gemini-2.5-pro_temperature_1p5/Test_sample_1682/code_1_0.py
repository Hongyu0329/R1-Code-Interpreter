    This function analyzes statements about Chinese wedding traditions to find the incorrect one.

    analysis = """
Step-by-step analysis:
1.  The goal is to identify the incorrect statement among the given choices about Chinese wedding history.
2.  Statement A claims the 'dragon and phoenix robe' (longfeng gua) was formalized during the Ming Dynasty. While Ming Dynasty bridal wear was elaborate and featured the phoenix crown and xiapei, the specific 'longfeng gua' style became popular much later, during the late Qing Dynasty. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.
3.  Statement B correctly states that brides in the Zhou Dynasty were veiled, a practice documented in ancient ritual texts.
4.  Statement C correctly notes the Tang and Song dynasty custom of brides using a fan to cover their faces upon leaving home.
5.  Statement D is correct in that the phoenix crown and xiapei became the standard ceremonial attire for high-ranking women after the Song dynasty, which commoners could emulate for their weddings.
6.  Statement E provides a correct description of common Han Chinese bridal attire during the Qing Dynasty.

Conclusion: The most historically inaccurate statement is A.
