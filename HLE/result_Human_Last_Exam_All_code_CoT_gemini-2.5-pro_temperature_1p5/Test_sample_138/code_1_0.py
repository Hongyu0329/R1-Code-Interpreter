# The properties of the lattice are:
n = 17 # Dimension
d = 2  # Determinant
# The lattice is positive definite, so its signature is the dimension.
sigma = 17

# According to a theorem on even lattices, there must exist a
# characteristic vector w in the lattice such that its norm (squared length)
# satisfies: w_dot_w = sigma (mod 8).
# For this lattice, this means w_dot_w = 17 (mod 8), which simplifies to
# w_dot_w = 1 (mod 8).
# This implies that w_dot_w must be an odd integer.

# However, by the definition of an even lattice, the norm of EVERY vector
# in the lattice must be an even integer. Since the characteristic vector w
# is part of the lattice, w_dot_w must be an even integer.

# This is a contradiction: a number cannot be both odd and even.
# Therefore, no such lattice can exist.

# We represent this conclusion as a simple equation resulting in 0.
number_of_lattices = 0
dim = 17
det = 2

# The equation shows that despite the given dimension and determinant, the number of lattices is zero.
