    "My plan is to determine if such a lattice can exist by checking for contradictions in its required mathematical properties.\n\n1.  **Identify Key Properties**: I will start by listing the given properties of the lattice:\n    *   Dimension $n = 17$.\n    *   Determinant $d = 2$.\n    *   It is a positive definite lattice. This means its signature $\\sigma$ (number of positive eigenvalues minus negative eigenvalues of the Gram matrix) is $\\sigma = 17 - 0 = 17$.\n    *   It is an even lattice, meaning the squared length (or \"norm\") of every lattice vector is an even integer.\n\n2.  **Use the Characteristic Vector Theorem**: There is a fundamental theorem in lattice theory concerning a special vector called the \"characteristic vector\". For any even lattice $L$, there exists a characteristic vector $w$ within the lattice itself ($w \\in L$) whose norm satisfies the congruence $w \\cdot w \\equiv \\sigma \\pmod 8$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Theorem**: I will apply this theorem to the lattice in question. We have $\\sigma = 17$, so the theorem implies that there must be a vector $w$ in our lattice such that $w \\cdot w \\equiv 17 \\pmod 8$. This simplifies to $w \\cdot w \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n\n4.  **Check for Contradiction**:\n    *   From the theorem, the norm $w \\cdot w$ must be an integer that is congruent to 1 modulo 8 (e.g., 1, 9, 17, 25,...). All such numbers are odd.\n    *   From the definition of an even lattice, the norm of any vector in the lattice must be an even integer. Since the characteristic vector $w$ is in the lattice, its norm $w \\cdot w$ must be even.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: This leads to a contradiction: the norm of the vector $w$ must be both odd (from the characteristic vector theorem) and even (from the definition of an even lattice). This is impossible. Therefore, the initial assumption that such a lattice exists must be false.\n\nThe number of such lattices is zero. I will now write a Python script to formalize and print this result. The calculation will represent that the impossibility of satisfying the conditions leads to a count of zero.\n\n```python\n# The properties of the lattice are:\nn = 17 # Dimension\nd = 2  # Determinant\n# The lattice is positive definite, so its signature is the dimension.\nsigma = 17\n\n# According to a theorem on even lattices, there must exist a\n# characteristic vector w in the lattice such that its norm (squared length)\n# satisfies: w_dot_w = sigma (mod 8).\n# For this lattice, this means w_dot_w = 17 (mod 8), which simplifies to\n# w_dot_w = 1 (mod 8).\n# This implies that w_dot_w must be an odd integer.\n\n# However, by the definition of an even lattice, the norm of EVERY vector\n# in the lattice must be an even integer. Since the characteristic vector w\n# is part of the lattice, w_dot_w must be an even integer.\n\n# This is a contradiction: a number cannot be both odd and even.\n# Therefore, no such lattice can exist.\n\n# We represent this conclusion as a simple equation resulting in 0.\nnumber_of_lattices = 0\ndim = 17\ndet = 2\n\n# The equation shows that despite the given dimension and determinant, the number of lattices is zero.\nprint(f\"({number_of_lattices}) * dimension({dim}) * determinant({det}) = 0\")\nprint(\"Number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2:\")\nprint(number_of_lattices)\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"
