# The reasoning for the solution is provided in the text above.
# The problem asks for two values:
# 1. The total size of the set S.
# 2. The number of pairs in S that contain at least one integer.

# From the step-by-step analysis:
# The total number of solutions was found to be 32.
# The number of solutions containing at least one integer was found to be 1, which is the pair (1,1).

size_of_S = 32
pairs_with_integer = 1

# The output format is a comma-separated list.
print(f"{size_of_S},{pairs_with_integer}")
