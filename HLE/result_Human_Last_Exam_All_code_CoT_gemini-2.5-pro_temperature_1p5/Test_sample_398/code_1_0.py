    print("3. A known theorem states that for a maximal planar G, the crossing number of G' is exactly 1.")
    print("This means G' can be drawn with exactly one crossing, which is the minimum possible.")
    print("This narrows down the answer to B or E.")

    print("\nThe only edge missing from G (between existing vertices) is e = (1, 5).")

    print("In a plane drawing of G, the cycle C = (2,3,4) separates the plane. We can place vertex 1 inside C and vertex 5 outside C.")
    print("To draw the new edge e = (1, 5), it must cross the boundary of the cycle C.")
    print("The edges of cycle C are (2,3), (3,4), and (4,2). The new edge can cross any one of them.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Since we have found two valid drawings of G' with one crossing, but the crossing occurs between different pairs of edges, the drawing is NOT unique.")
    print("Therefore, the correct statement is: G' can be drawn in the plane with at most one crossing, but this is not unique.")
