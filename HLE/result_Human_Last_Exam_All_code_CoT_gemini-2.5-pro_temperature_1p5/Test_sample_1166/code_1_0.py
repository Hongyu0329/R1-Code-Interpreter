    """
    Analyzes which functions from a given list are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.

    A function f is defined as Lebesgue integrable on a set E if:
    1. f is a measurable function.
    2. The Lebesgue integral of its absolute value is finite: ∫_E |f| dμ < ∞.

    This script evaluates each option against these two conditions.

              "No. The domain of the function is not specified, so it could be a set of infinite measure, like the real line ℝ. "
              "Counterexample: The function f(x) = 5 for all x in ℝ is bounded (by 5) and measurable. "

              "Counterexample: On the interval [0,1], let f(x) = 1/x for x in (0, 1] and f(0) = 0. f is measurable, but ∫_[0,1] |1/x| dμ = ∞."),

              "Therefore, ∫_[a,b] |f| dμ ≤ M * (b-a). For example, if |f(x)| ≤ 10 on [0, 2], the integral is at most 10 * 2 = 20, which is finite. Both conditions for integrability are met."),

               "Here, |f(x)| = 1 on [0, 1]. |f| is measurable and ∫|f|dμ = 1, so |f| is integrable. "
               "But f is not measurable because the preimage f⁻¹({1}) = P is not a measurable set. Thus, f is not Lebesgue integrable."),

              "Yes. Continuous implies measurable. The function is bounded, so |f(x)| ≤ M for some number M. The domain (a,b) has finite measure b-a. "
