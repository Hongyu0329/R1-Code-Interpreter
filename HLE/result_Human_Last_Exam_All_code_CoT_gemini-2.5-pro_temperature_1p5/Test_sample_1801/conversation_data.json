    "This is a factual question that can be answered by recalling specific historical information. My plan is to first identify the two Nobel laureates from my knowledge base. Then, as requested, I will write a simple Python script to store these names and print them out in a formatted sentence to answer the user's question directly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_enron_commercial_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in a 2000 Enron commercial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two Nobel laureates in Economics featured in the commercial\n    laureate1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\n    laureate2 = \"Amartya Sen\"\n    \n    # The company and tagline for context\n    company = \"Enron\"\n    tagline = \"Ask Why\"\n    year = 2000\n\n    print(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous {year} commercial for {company}, with the tagline \\\"{tagline}\\\", were:\")\n    print(f\"1. {laureate1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {laureate2}\")\n\nsolve_enron_commercial_question()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Amartya Sen>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
