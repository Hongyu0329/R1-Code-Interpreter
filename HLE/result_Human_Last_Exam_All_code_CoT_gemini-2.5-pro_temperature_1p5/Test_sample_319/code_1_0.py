    # 1. Lower Bound: A construction can be made with N planes, creating Omega(N^m) special points.
    #    This shows c must be at least m.
    # 2. Upper Bound: An incidence counting argument shows that for any configuration of N planes,
    #    the number of special points is at most O(N^m). This shows c must be at most m.
    #
    # Combining both arguments, we conclude that the largest possible value of c is m.
