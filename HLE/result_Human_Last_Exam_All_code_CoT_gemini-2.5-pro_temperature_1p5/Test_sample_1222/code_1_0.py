    print("\nAnswer: Yes.")
    print("\nExplanation:")
    print("The problem statement defines g's action from the outset: 'The map g acts as a reflection on Q with g . e_i = e_{n-d-i}'.")
    print("This means 'g acts by a reflection' is a given premise. In logic, if a statement Q is true, then the implication P => Q is always true, regardless of the statement P.")

    print("Question: Provide a condition on d for which sigma(a) != 0 must hold for all a in Q_1.")
    print("\nAnswer: The condition is that (n - d) must be an odd number.")
    print("\nExplanation:")
    print("1. From the properties of the action g, we can deduce that g composed with itself is the identity. Applying the sigma map definition twice shows that for a non-zero sigma to exist, we must have lambda^2 = 1. The interesting case to consider is when lambda = -1.")
    print("2. The key defining relation for sigma is: sigma(g . a) = -g . sigma(a).")
    print("3. Let's consider an arrow 'a' that is a fixed point of the map g, which means g . a = a. For such an arrow, the relation simplifies to sigma(a) = -g . sigma(a).")
    print("4. An arrow a going from vertex i to j (a: i -> j) is a fixed point if and only if its endpoints are fixed points, meaning g . i = i and g . j = j.")
    print("5. A vertex i is a fixed point if it satisfies the equation derived from the definition of g's action: n - d - i = i.")
    print("6. This equation can be rearranged to find the condition for a vertex 'i' to be a fixed point:")
    print("   n - d = 2 * i")
    print("7. If an arrow 'a' is a fixed point of g, it's a standard assumption in this context that sigma(a) is also fixed by g's action (i.e., g . sigma(a) = sigma(a)).")
    print("8. If this holds, the relation from step 3 becomes sigma(a) = -sigma(a), which implies 2 * sigma(a) = 0. Assuming the base field's characteristic is not 2, this forces sigma(a) = 0.")
    print("9. If sigma(a) is forced to be 0 for some 'a', then the condition 'sigma(a) != 0 for all a' is violated.")
    print("10. To ensure that sigma(a) can be non-zero for all 'a', we must set a condition on 'd' that prevents any arrow 'a' from being a fixed point.")
    print("11. This is guaranteed if no vertex 'i' is a fixed point. This means the equation from step 6, n - d = 2 * i, should have no integer solution for 'i'.")
    print("12. This is always true if the left side of the equation, (n - d), is an odd number, because an odd number can never be equal to an even number (2 * i).")
    print("\nTherefore, the required condition on d is that (n - d) must be odd. We can express this condition with the following equation, where k is any integer:")
    print("n - d = 2 * k + 1")
