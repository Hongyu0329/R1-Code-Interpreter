    "To determine the binding affinity of the specified compound to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), I will perform a programmatic search of the ChEMBL database, which is a major public repository for bioactive drug-like small molecules.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Use the `chembl_webresource_client` library in Python to connect to the ChEMBL database.\n2.  Identify the molecule. Instead of using its long chemical name, I will use its standard InChIKey (`FFBYZBHUDGUPCR-CQSZACIVSA-N`), which is a unique structural identifier, to find its entry in the database. The common name for this compound is SY-1365.\n3.  Identify the protein target, Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), using its UniProt accession ID (`P50613`).\n4.  Query the database for all recorded activity assays linking this specific molecule to this specific target. I will look for standard binding affinity measurements, such as IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration).\n5.  Print the retrieved binding affinity values. The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\", which I will interpret as displaying the values found in the database.\n6.  Finally, I will compare the found values to the given answer choices to determine the correct range.\n\nThis script requires the `chembl_webresource_client` library.
