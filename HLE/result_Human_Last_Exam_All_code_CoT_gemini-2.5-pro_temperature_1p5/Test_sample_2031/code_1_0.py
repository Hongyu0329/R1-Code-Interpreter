    Analyzes the significance of 'opals' in the poem.

    1.  The poem describes a woman haunted by memories of a vibrant, complex, and secret-filled past.
    2.  Her present state is "bedbound" and her skin is "moonstone silver, always silver, always cold," suggesting stillness or death.
    3.  In stark contrast, her "keepsake eyes are opals."
    4.  Opals are gemstones known for their "play-of-color"â€”a shifting, multi-colored internal fire and depth that changes with the light.
    5.  This visual quality of the opal serves as a powerful metaphor. While her body is cold and static, her eyes (representing her inner self and memories) still contain the deep, complex, and shifting light of her past.
    6.  This directly connects to other light imagery like the "fractured light from chandeliers" in her dreams and the way secrets "flew like moths."
    7.  Therefore, the opals symbolize the dynamic, multifaceted, and non-static nature of her memories from deep in her past. "The shifting depth of memories" is the most accurate description of this significance.
