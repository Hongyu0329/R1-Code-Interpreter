    This function identifies the most historically and archaeologically accurate
    statement about the Mausoleum of Augustus from a given list of choices.

    The correct statement is F because:
    1.  Architectural Influence: It correctly identifies that the Mausoleum's design
        was influenced by the monumental tombs of Hellenistic (eastern) kings,
        a point of consensus among scholars for interpreting Augustan-era architecture.
    2.  Res Gestae Inscription: It states that the Res Gestae Divi Augusti was
        inscribed on bronze pillars at the entrance. This is a primary historical fact,
        confirmed by Augustus's own writing and the discovery of the text's copies.

    This combination of a major scholarly interpretation and a documented fact gives
    it the most backing.
