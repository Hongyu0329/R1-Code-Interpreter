    # --- Step 1 & 2: Analyze the Board and Find White's Weaknesses ---
    # The key insight is that the white stones are not one connected group.
    # They form four distinct groups:
    # Group 1: {(2, 5)} -> Liberties at (1, 5), (2, 4)
    # Group 2: {(1, 4)} -> Liberties at (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4)
    # Group 3: {(3, 4), (3, 3)} -> Liberties at (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2)
    # Group 4: {(2, 2)} -> Liberties at (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
    #
    # The point (2, 4) is a critical weakness as it is a shared liberty for the first three groups.

    # --- Step 3 & 4: Evaluate the Best Move and Simulate ---
    # We will analyze the move (2, 4).
    #
    # Move: Black plays at (2, 4).
    #
    # Immediate Consequences:
    # - White's stone at (2, 5) is put into "atari" (it has only one liberty left at (1, 5)).
    # - Other white groups are also weakened.
    #
    # This forces White's hand. White must play at (1, 5) to save the stone.
    # If White plays elsewhere, Black simply captures the stone at (2, 5), leading to a collapse of the other White positions.
    #
    # The sequence demonstrates Black's advantage:
    # 1. B(2, 4) -> White must respond to the atari.
    # 2. W(1, 5) -> White saves the stone, but now Black has the initiative ("sente").
    # 3. B(1, 3) -> Black continues to attack, creating more weak points for White.
    #
    # This initial move at (2, 4) initiates a forcing sequence that Black can use to
    # systematically capture all white stones. No other move is as powerful.
