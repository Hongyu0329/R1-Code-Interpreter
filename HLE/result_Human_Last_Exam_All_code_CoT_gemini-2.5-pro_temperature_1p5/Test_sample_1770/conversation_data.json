    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you need to identify and knock out the gene responsible for the first step in its catabolic pathway. In *C. glutamicum*, p-coumaric acid is primarily degraded by a phenolic acid decarboxylase (PDC), which converts it into 4-vinylphenol. The code below will print the name of the gene encoding this enzyme.\n\n```python\ndef find_knockout_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the gene to knock out in Corynebacterium glutamicum to prevent\n    p-coumaric acid degradation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The product, p-coumaric acid, is degraded via a specific catabolic pathway.\n    # The first and key step in this degradation is the decarboxylation of\n    # p-coumaric acid to 4-vinylphenol.\n    enzyme = \"Phenolic Acid Decarboxylase (PDC)\"\n    \n    # This enzyme is encoded by a specific gene in the C. glutamicum genome.\n    # In the reference strain C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, this gene is cg3064.\n    # It is also commonly referred to as 'pdc'.\n    gene_to_knockout = \"cg3064 (pdc)\"\n\n    print(\"To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in Corynebacterium glutamicum, you should knock out the gene that encodes the enzyme responsible for its initial breakdown.\")\n    print(f\"The primary degradation enzyme is: {enzyme}\")\n    print(f\"This enzyme converts p-coumaric acid into 4-vinylphenol.\")\n    print(f\"The gene encoding this enzyme in C. glutamicum is: {gene_to_knockout}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, knocking out this gene will block the degradation pathway and lead to the accumulation of p-coumaric acid.\")\n\nfind_knockout_target()\n\n```\n<<<cg3064 (pdc)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
