    This function analyzes the relationship between the spectra of two
    supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians to find the maximum number
    of differing energy levels.

    Problem Setup:
    We are given two Hamiltonians, H_0 and H_1, related by factorization:
    H_0 = L_plus * L - alpha
    H_1 = L * L_plus - alpha
    where L = d/dx - W(x) and L_plus = -d/dx - W(x).

    Analysis Steps:

    1. Mapping from H_0 to H_1:
    Let psi_0 be an eigenstate of H_0 with energy E.
    H_0 * psi_0 = E * psi_0
    (L_plus * L - alpha) * psi_0 = E * psi_0
    
    Applying L to this equation shows that (L * psi_0) is an eigenstate of H_1
    with the same energy E:
    H_1 * (L * psi_0) = E * (L * psi_0)

    2. The Exceptional State (for H_0):
    This mapping creates a one-to-one correspondence of energy levels, unless
    the new state is zero, i.e., L * psi_0 = 0.
    If L * psi_0 = 0, the state psi_0 does not have a partner in H_1's spectrum.
    Let's find the energy of this state. From the H_0 eigenvalue equation:
    L_plus * (L * psi_0) = (E + alpha) * psi_0
    L_plus * 0 = (E + alpha) * psi_0
    Since psi_0 is not zero, this requires E + alpha = 0, so E = -alpha.
    Conclusion: A state of H_0 with energy E = -alpha is an unpaired level.

    3. Symmetric Analysis for H_1 to H_0:
    Similarly, any eigenstate psi_1 of H_1 maps to an eigenstate of H_0 with
    the same energy, unless L_plus * psi_1 = 0.
    This exceptional case also occurs if and only if the state's energy is E = -alpha.
    Conclusion: A state of H_1 with energy E = -alpha would also be an unpaired level.

    4. Uniqueness of the Unpaired State:
    The question is whether both H_0 and H_1 can have an unpaired state at E = -alpha.
    This would mean both equations L * psi = 0 and L_plus * phi = 0 have normalizable
    solutions. In quantum mechanics on a given interval with regular potentials,
    it can be shown that at most one of these equations can have a valid,
    normalizable solution.
    Therefore, at most one of the two Hamiltonians can possess the state with
    energy E = -alpha.

    5. Final Conclusion:
    The spectra of H_0 and H_1 are identical, except for a possible single state
    at energy E = -alpha. This state can belong to either H_0 or H_1, but not both.
    Therefore, the maximum number of levels of the spectrum that can differ is 1.
