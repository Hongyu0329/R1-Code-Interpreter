# Plan:
# 1. The precipitation of the probe indicates poor water solubility.
# 2. Water solubility can be estimated by the chemical property logP. A lower logP means higher water solubility.
# 3. The probe's '6-chlorohexyl' group is a major contributor to its hydrophobicity.
# 4. We will follow the user's suggestion to incorporate a PEG group by modeling the replacement of the
#    hydrophobic '6-chlorohexyl' tail with a hydrophilic tail made of three PEG units.
# 5. The script calculates the logP contribution for each tail and the total change (delta logP).
# 6. A large negative delta logP will strongly indicate that the modification will solve the precipitation problem.

# Define standard fragment contribution values for logP calculation (approximate).
logP_contribution_ch2 = 0.5  # Contribution of one -CH2- (methylene) group
logP_contribution_cl = 0.7   # Contribution of a Chlorine atom on an alkyl chain
logP_contribution_peg_unit = -0.1 # Contribution of one -(CH2CH2O)- (PEG) unit, which is highly hydrophilic
logP_contribution_oh = -1.1   # Contribution of a terminal -OH (hydroxyl) group
