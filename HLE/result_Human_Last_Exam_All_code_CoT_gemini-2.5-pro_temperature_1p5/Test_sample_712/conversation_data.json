    "The user is asking for the genus of a bacterium known for producing a chemical compound that displays triboluminescent properties.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Access my knowledge base to identify the specific bacterium. The phenomenon in question is triboluminescence, which is the emission of light when a material is mechanically broken.\n2.  The bacterium is *Photorhabdus luminescens*. This bacterium is primarily known for its bioluminescence, produced by the enzyme luciferase.\n3.  When the luciferase from this bacterium is purified and crystallized, these crystals exhibit triboluminescence. Smashing the crystals causes them to flash.\n4.  Therefore, the genus is *Photorhabdus*.\n5.  I will write a Python script that stores this information in a variable and prints it in a clear, informative sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_bacterium_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the genus of a bacterium\n    associated with triboluminescence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus of the bacterium is Photorhabdus.\n    # It produces luciferase, which when crystallized, exhibits triboluminescence.\n    genus = \"Photorhabdus\"\n    \n    # Print the answer in a full sentence for clarity.\n    print(f\"The genus of bacterium that produces a chemical compound exhibiting triboluminescent properties is: {genus}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_bacterium_genus()\n```\n<<<Photorhabdus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What genus of bacterium produces a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
