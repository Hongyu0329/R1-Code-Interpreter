    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nIn finite-temperature quantum field theory, the partition function `Z` for a given field is calculated using a functional integral over all possible field configurations. For a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, this is written as:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`\n\nHere, `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action for the scalar field. The task is to express this action in the form `S_E = (1/2)(ϕ, D_ϕ)`, and then identify the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Start with the standard Euclidean action for a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m`.\n2.  Use integration by parts to rearrange the derivative terms. This will naturally reveal the differential operator `D`.\n3.  Identify the full expression for the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n4.  Present this final mathematical expression using a Python script, as requested. The script will print the formula and break down its components, including all numerical coefficients, to make it clear.\n\nHere is the Python script to display the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the mathematical expression for the inner product\n    (ϕ, D_ϕ) for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function Z for a neutral scalar field ϕ is given by the functional integral:\")\n    print(\"  Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])\")\n    print(\"where S_E is the Euclidean action.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe action is commonly written in the quadratic form S_E = (1/2)(ϕ, D_ϕ).\")\n    print(\"The inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is therefore twice the action.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- The Final Equation ---\n    print(\"\\nThe inner product in position space is given by the following integral:\")\n    \n    # Define the components of the mathematical expression\n    integral_part = \"∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x\"\n    field = \"ϕ(τ, x)\"\n    \n    # Define the terms of the differential operator D\n    # The coefficients are the numbers in the equation\n    coeff_time_deriv = -1\n    op_time_deriv = \"(∂/∂τ)²\"\n    \n    coeff_space_deriv = -1\n    op_space_deriv = \"∇²\"\n    \n    coeff_mass_term = 1\n    op_mass_term = \"m²\"\n    \n    # Construct and print the full equation string\n    # We display the numbers (coefficients) 1 and -1 explicitly in the final equation's breakdown.\n    final_equation = f\"(ϕ, D_ϕ) = {integral_part} {field} * [ -{op_time_deriv} - {op_space_deriv} + {op_mass_term} ] {field}\"\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + final_equation + \"\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Explanation of Terms ---\n    print(\"Where the components of the final equation are:\")\n    print(f\"  - `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`: The inner product.\")\n    print(f\"  - `{integral_part}`: The integral over Euclidean spacetime.\")\n    print(f\"      - `τ`: Imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β (where β = 1/T, and T is temperature).\")\n    print(f\"      - `x`: The 3 spatial coordinates, integrated over all space.\")\n    print(f\"  - `{field}`: The neutral scalar field.\")\n    print(f\"  - `D = -{op_time_deriv} - {op_space_deriv} + {op_mass_term}`: This is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.
