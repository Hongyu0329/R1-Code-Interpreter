    """
    Calculates and prints the formula for the Joule heat dissipated by a shrinking, leaking sphere.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The initial electrostatic energy (U) of a sphere with radius 'a' and potential 'V' is U = 2 * pi * epsilon_0 * a * V^2.
    2. This energy is converted into Joule heat (H) and mechanical work (W) done by the field on the shrinking sphere. So, U = H + W.
    3. The mechanical work (W) is done on the gas inside, which is then vented. We assume this work is also converted to heat in the atmosphere.
    4. Therefore, the total heat dissipated in the atmosphere is H_total = H + W = U.
    5. The final answer is the initial stored energy.

    # The problem provides variables 'a' and 'V' without numerical values.
    # The answer is a formula in terms of these variables and physical constants.
    
    # The final equation for the total dissipated heat (H_total) is:
    # H_total = 2 * pi * epsilon_0 * a * V^2

    # The prompt requires outputting each number/constant in the final equation.
