    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method:** I will first detail the key principles of a cambré derrière in the Vaganova method. This technique emphasizes precise body alignment, strength, and stability. A crucial element is keeping the hips square to the direction the dancer is facing.\n2.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method:** Next, I will describe the characteristics of a cambré derrière in the Balanchine style. This method prioritizes speed, musicality, and creating long, dramatic lines. To achieve a more extreme backbend, the Balanchine method often permits the hip to open or lift.\n3.  **Compare and Contrast:** I will compare the key characteristics of both methods against the provided answer choices (A, B, C, D, E).\n4.  **Identify the Primary Difference:** The most fundamental structural difference that distinguishes the two styles in this specific movement is the handling of the hips. This difference in hip placement directly affects the degree of the backbend and the overall aesthetic line.\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:** Based on the comparison, I will identify the most accurate answer choice and present it in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the differences between Vaganova and Balanchine\n    methods for a cambré derrière and selects the correct answer choice.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the characteristics of each method.\n    vaganova_characteristic = \"Hips must remain square and aligned, using the upper and middle back for the bend.
