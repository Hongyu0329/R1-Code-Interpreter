# The fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene" is interpreted as a central benzene ring
# with three other benzene rings attached, resembling the Mercedes-Benz logo.
# This structure is chemically known as 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.

# 1. Define the number of carbons in the central benzene ring.
central_ring_carbons = 6

# 2. Define the number of attached rings (the "points" of the star).
num_attached_rings = 3

# 3. Define the number of carbons in each attached benzene ring.
carbons_per_ring = 6

# 4. Calculate the total number of carbon atoms.
total_carbons = central_ring_carbons + (num_attached_rings * carbons_per_ring)

# 5. Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final equation.
