    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is the plan to compute the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$:\n\n1.  **Define the Generalized Markov Number**: The generalized Markov number $m_{r/s}$ associated with a rational number $r/s$ is given by the formula $m_{r/s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{r^2 + 4s^2}}{s}$.\n2.  **Calculate $m_{4/7}$**: I will substitute $r=4$ and $s=7$ into the formula and simplify the expression.\n    *   $m_{4/7} = \\frac{\\sqrt{4^2 + 4 \\cdot 7^2}}{7} = \\frac{\\sqrt{16 + 4 \\cdot 49}}{7} = \\frac{\\sqrt{16 + 196}}{7} = \\frac{\\sqrt{212}}{7}$.\n    *   Since $212 = 4 \\cdot 53$, the expression simplifies to $m_{4/7} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{53}}{7}$.\n3.  **Compute the Continued Fraction**: The number $\\frac{2\\sqrt{53}}{7}$ is a quadratic irrational, so its continued fraction is periodic. I will use the standard algorithm to find the sequence of coefficients. This involves repeatedly taking the integer part of the number and then the reciprocal of the fractional part.\n4.  **Present the Python Code**: I will provide a Python script that automates this calculation. The script will compute the coefficients and then print the derivation and the final continued fraction in the required format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the computation and display the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n\ndef compute_cfrac_for_markov_number(r, s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{r/s}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
