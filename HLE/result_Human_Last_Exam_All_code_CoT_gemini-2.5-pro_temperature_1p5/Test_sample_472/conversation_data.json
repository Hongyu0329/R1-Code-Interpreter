    "This task requires scanning a line of Latin poetry, which means identifying each syllable as either long or short. The meter of this line, which comes from the early comic playwright Turpilius, is a Trochaic Septenarius, which consists of seven trochaic feet (`L S`) or their metrical equivalents.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the scansion:\n1.  **Identify Elision**: In Latin poetry, when a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, the first vowel is typically dropped. In our line, `bene esse` is treated as a single phonetic unit, `benesse`. This reduces the syllable count.\n2.  **Syllabify the Line**: After elision, the line is spoken as `et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male`. This gives a total of 14 syllables.\n3.  **Determine Syllable Quantity**: Each of the 14 syllables is determined to be Long (L) or Short (S) based on two main rules:\n    *   A syllable is **long by nature** if its vowel is a diphthong (like `ae`) or naturally long (like `ō` in `sōlī`).\n    *   A syllable is **long by position** if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (e.g., the `e` in `et` is followed by the `t` in `et` and the `t` in `tibi`).\n    *   Otherwise, a syllable is **short**.\n4.  **Group into Feet**: The 14 syllables are grouped into seven 2-syllable feet. While the ideal foot is a trochee (L S), substitutions like a spondee (L L) or pyrrhic (S S) are common.\n\nHere is the detailed scansion:\n*   `et ti` | `bi be` | `nes se` | `so li` | `quom si` | `bi sit` | `ma le`\n*   L S | S S | L S | L L | L S | S L | S S\n\nThe following Python script will print this final result.\n\n```python\ndef print_scansion():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the metrical scansion for the Latin line:\n    \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    'L' represents a long syllable and 'S' represents a short syllable.\n    The syllables are grouped into metrical feet separated by spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    line = \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n    # The scansion is a Trochaic Septenarius, broken down into seven feet.\n    # The analysis results in the following feet:\n    # 1. et(L) ti(S)\n    # 2. bi(S) be(S) (from ti'bi' and 'be'nesse)\n    # 3. nes(L) se(S) (from be'nes''se')\n    # 4. so(L) li(L)\n    # 5. quom(L) si(S)\n    # 6. bi(S) sit(L)\n    # 7. ma(S) le(S)\n\n    foot1 = \"L S\"\n    foot2 = \"S S\"\n    foot3 = \"L S\"\n    foot4 = \"L L\"\n    foot5 = \"L S\"\n    foot6 = \"S L\"\n    foot7 = \"S S\"\n\n    print(f\"Line: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n    print(\"Scansion:\")\n    # We print each symbol of the final result by assembling the string.\n    print(f\"{foot1} {foot2} {foot3} {foot4} {foot5} {foot6} {foot7}\")\n\nprint_scansion()\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
