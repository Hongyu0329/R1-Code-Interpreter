    print("Orange is a mixture of Red and Yellow colors.")

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the Color Sources ---
    print("Source of Red color:")

    print("Evaluating the two possible original colors for a microbe missing only Enzyme B:")
    print("")
    print("Scenario 1: Original patch was YELLOW.")
    print("  - The microbe would convert the Yellow pigment to Red intermediate (Yellow --(A)--> Red).")
    print("  - The original Yellow pigment would be completely consumed in this process.")
    print("  - Final Color: Red. (This is not Orange).")
    print("")
    print("Scenario 2: Original patch was BLUE.")
    print("  - The microbe uses Enzyme D to convert Blue pigment to a Yellow product (Blue --(D)--> Yellow).")
    print("  - It then uses Enzyme A to convert this new Yellow product to a Red intermediate (Yellow --(A)--> Red).")
    print("  - Because Enzyme B is missing, the Red intermediate accumulates.")
    print("  - This results in a mixture of the Yellow product and the Red intermediate.")
    print("  - Final Color: Yellow + Red = Orange. (This matches the observation).")
    print("")

    # --- Step 4: Conclusion ---
    print("Conclusion: The microbe is missing Enzyme B, and the original patch was Blue.")
