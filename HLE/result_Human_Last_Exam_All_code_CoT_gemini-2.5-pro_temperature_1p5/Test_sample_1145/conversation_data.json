    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a given interval. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Wavefunction**: The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by Ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a).\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density**: The probability of finding the particle at a specific position x is given by the square of the wavefunction, |Ψn(x)|². This is the probability density function, P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a).\n3.  **Set up the Integral**: The probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ to x₂ is calculated by integrating the probability density function over that interval: P = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a) dx.\n4.  **Substitute Values**: For this problem, the quantum state is n = 2, and the interval is from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a.\n5.  **Calculate the Integral**: The integral to be solved is P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx. We can solve this integral numerically using Python's SciPy library, which is a reliable and accurate method. I will write a Python script that defines the probability density function and then uses the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to compute the definite integral.\n\nThe script will print out all the parameters used in the calculation and the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants for the problem.\n# The quantum number n.\nn = 2\n# The length of the box 'a'. We can set it to 1.0 since the 'a'\n# dependency cancels out and the probability is dimensionless.\na = 1.0\n# The lower bound of the interval.\nx1 = 0.495 * a\n# The upper bound of the interval.\nx2 = 0.505 * a\n\n# Step 2: Define the probability density function, |psi(x)|^2.\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the probability density for a particle in a 1D box.\n  |psi(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a)\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the probability by numerically integrating the\n# probability density function over the interval [x1, x2].\n# The quad function returns the result of the integral and an estimate of the error.\nprobability, error_estimate = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# Step 4: Print the inputs and the final calculated probability.\nprint(\"Calculating the probability that the particle in a 1D box is located in an interval from x1 to x2.\")\nprint(f\"Quantum state (n): {n}\")\nprint(f\"Interval start (x1): {x1}a\")\nprint(f\"Interval end (x2): {x2}a\")\nprint(\"\\nThe probability is the integral of (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a) from x1 to x2.\")\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated Probability = {probability}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.000006579736591723325>>>"
