    "This is a knowledge-based question rooted in Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker strategy. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The situation is a 100 big blind (BB) deep, rake-free No-Limit Hold'em cash game. The action is an open-raise from the Button (BTN) position. The raise size is 2.5x the big blind.\n\n2.  **Understand the Position:** The Button is the most powerful position in poker because you are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street. This positional advantage allows you to play a very wide and aggressive range of hands profitably. You can \"steal\" the blinds pre-flop or use your position to out-maneuver opponents after the flop.\n\n3.  **Consider the Game Conditions:**\n    *   **100BB Depth:** This is the standard stack depth for cash games, and most GTO pre-flop charts are built for this depth.\n    *   **Rake-Free:** The absence of rake (the fee taken by the house) increases the expected value (EV) of playing every hand. This means you should play a slightly wider/looser range of hands than you would in a raked game.\n\n4.  **Consult GTO Ranges:** Modern poker strategy relies on GTO solvers to create balanced pre-flop ranges. For a BTN open at 100BB, the GTO range is extremely wide, often including 45-50% of all possible starting hands.\n\n5.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Suited Jack:** We need to find the suited Jack with the lowest kicker that is still considered a standard, profitable open-raise in this spot. The suited Jack hands, in descending order of strength, are AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. According to standard GTO charts, a BTN open range at 100BB is so wide that it includes *all* suited Jacks. If a hand like J2s is a profitable open *with* rake (which it is in most modern solutions), it is definitely a profitable open in a *rake-free* environment.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since all suited Jacks are part of a standard Button opening range, the \"worst\" one (the one with the lowest equity that is still a standard open) is the one with the lowest possible kicker: Jack-Two suited.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n    Based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker strategy, the button's opening range is very wide.\n    This range includes all suited Jack combinations because of the powerful positional advantage.\n    The suited Jacks are ranked by their kicker: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    The \"worst\" hand in this category that is still a standard open-raise is the one with the lowest kicker.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    worst_suited_jack = \"J2s\"\n    \n    # The abbreviated hand format is the card rank followed by the kicker and 's' for suited.\n    # J = Jack\n    # 2 = Two\n    # s = suited\n    \n    print(f\"The worst suited Jack to open from the button in this scenario is: {worst_suited_jack}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
