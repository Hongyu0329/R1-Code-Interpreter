    Solves the conceptual questions about the two-matrix model.

    (a) Superintegrability for n=3: The matrix model Z_{-n}(t) with potential (1/n)Tr(Φ₂ⁿ)
        is known to satisfy Wₙ-algebra constraints. For n=3, the potential is cubic,
        leading to W₃-constraints. The combination of being a KP/Toda tau-function and satisfying
        W-constraints defines superintegrability in this context. Thus, Z_{-3}(t) is superintegrable.

    (b) Necessity of W-algebra for n=4: For n=4, the potential is quartic, leading to
        W₄-constraints. The W₄ algebra includes a spin-4 generator, which is not present in
        the W₃ algebra (for n=3). These new constraints are independent and necessary to fully
        characterize the partition function Z_{-4}(t). Thus, the W₄-structure is necessary.
