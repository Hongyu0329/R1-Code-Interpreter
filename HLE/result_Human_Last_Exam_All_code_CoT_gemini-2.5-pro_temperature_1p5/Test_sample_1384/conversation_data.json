    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to express this very small number in scientific notation. Let the number be $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. We want to find its representation in the form $c \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le c < 10$ is the significand (or mantissa) and $k$ is an integer exponent. The first two non-zero digits of $N$ will be the first two digits of $c$.\n\nWe can find $c$ and $k$ by taking the base-10 logarithm of $N$:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nLet's call this value $L$. So, $L = \\log_{10}(N)$. Any real number $L$ can be decomposed into its integer and fractional parts:\n$L = \\lfloor L \\rfloor + \\{L\\}$\nwhere $\\lfloor L \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $L$ (the floor of L), and $\\{L\\}$ is the fractional part, satisfying $0 \\le \\{L\\} < 1$.\n\nSince $N = 10^L$, we can substitute the decomposed form of $L$:\n$N = 10^{\\lfloor L \\rfloor + \\{L\\}} = 10^{\\{L\\}} \\times 10^{\\lfloor L \\rfloor}$\n\nBy comparing this with the scientific notation form $N = c \\times 10^k$, we can identify:\n- The exponent $k = \\lfloor L \\rfloor = \\lfloor -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e) \\rfloor$\n- The significand $c = 10^{\\{L\\}} = 10^{L - \\lfloor L \\rfloor}$\n\nSince $0 \\le \\{L\\} < 1$, it follows that $10^0 \\le 10^{\\{L\\}} < 10^1$, which means $1 \\le c < 10$. This confirms that $c$ is exactly the significand whose first two digits we need to find.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Calculate $7^{13}$.\n2.  Calculate $L = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$ using high-precision arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n3.  Determine the fractional part of $L$, which we'll call $f$, where $f = L - \\lfloor L \\rfloor$.\n4.  Compute the significand $c = 10^f$.\n5.  Extract the first two digits from the resulting value of $c$.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan using the `decimal` module, which is suitable for high-precision floating-point arithmetic. The code will print each component of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef find_first_two_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of e^(-7^13)\n    by finding its scientific notation c * 10^k.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a high precision for the decimal calculations to ensure accuracy.\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = 100\n\n    # The final equation is of the form: e^(-(base^exponent)) = 10^f * 10^k\n    # We need to find the numbers that make up this equation.\n    base = 7\n    exponent = 13\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate base^exponent, which is 7^13\n    power_val = decimal.Decimal(base) ** exponent\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate log10(e).
