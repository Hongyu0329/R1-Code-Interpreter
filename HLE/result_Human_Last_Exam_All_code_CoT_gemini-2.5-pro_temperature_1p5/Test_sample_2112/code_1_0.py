# The problem appears to have a trick solution related to its constants.
# A plausible candidate for r_0 > 15 is constructed from the coefficient '4'
# present in the equation, as 4^2 = 16.

# Let the coefficient be a
a = 4
# The proposed solution r_0 is a^2
r_0 = a**2

# We need to present the equation and its solution.
# The equation is r_0 = 4^2.
