    "My plan is to solve this by first understanding the relationship between colors and music as defined by Isaac Newton's color circle.\n\n1.  **Identify the Colors:** The question mentions two points on the color circle to define a range.\n    *   The first point is the color produced by mixing yellow and blue. In additive color mixing (light), this is green.\n    *   The second point is the color blue.\n\n2.  **Determine the Range:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the \"range between\" green and blue. On Newton's circle, the colors are arranged in the order of the rainbow (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). The segment that lies between the yellow/green boundary and the green/blue boundary is the segment for the color **Green**.\n\n3.  **Map Color to Musical Note:** Newton mapped the seven colors of the spectrum to the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale. The standard mapping is:\n    *   Red -> C\n    *   Orange -> D\n    *   Yellow -> E\n    *   **Green -> F**\n    *   Blue -> G\n    *   Indigo -> A\n    *   Violet -> B\n\n4.  **Find the Answer:** Based on this mapping, the color Green corresponds to the musical note **F**.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that defines this mapping in a dictionary. The script will identify the target color based on the problem's description and then look up the corresponding note to print the final answer and the reasoning. I will represent the final mapping as an \"equation\" as requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_color_note_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the musical note corresponding to a color range on Newton's circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to musical notes.\n    # This is based on his division of the visible spectrum into seven colors,\n    # corresponding to the seven notes of a Western musical scale.\n    color_to_note_map = {\n        \"Red\": \"C\",\n        \"Orange\": \"D\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"Green\": \"F\",\n        \"Blue\": \"G\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"Violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the question to determine the target color.\n    # The question asks for the note in the range between \"the colour produced\n    # when combining yellow and blue\" and \"blue\".\n    # The color produced by mixing yellow and blue is Green.\n    # On Newton's circle (in order R,O,Y,G,B,I,V), the range *between* Green\n    # and Blue is the segment for Green itself.\n    target_color = \"Green\"\n    note_for_target_color = color_to_note_map[target_color]\n\n    # Step 3: Print the logic and the final answer.\n    # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    # As there are no numbers, we will show the key and value from the\n    # mapping as the final \"equation\".\n    print(\"Finding the musical note based on Newton's color circle.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"1.
