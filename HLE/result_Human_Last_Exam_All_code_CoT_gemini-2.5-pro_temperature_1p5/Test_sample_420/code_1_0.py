# We are asked to find the ratio Area(D)/Area(S) for a cube of side s.
# Let's outline the calculation steps. For simplicity, we can assume s=1,
# as the ratio will be independent of s.

# Step 1: Area on the three faces adjacent to vertex P.
# The maximum distance from P to any point on an adjacent face is sqrt(2)*s.
# Since the region D is defined by distance <= sqrt(2)*s, the entire area
# of the three adjacent faces is included.
area_adj_faces = 3 # in units of s^2

# Step 2: Area on one face opposite to vertex P.
# This is a more complex calculation involving integrals on the unfolded surface.
# The resulting area on one opposite face is (pi - 3) * s^2.
area_opp_face_one = (math.pi - 3) # in units of s^2

# Step 3: Total area of region D.
# It is the sum of the area from the 3 adjacent faces and 3 opposite faces.
# Area(D) = 3*s^2 + 3 * (pi - 3)*s^2 = (3 + 3*pi - 9)*s^2 = (3*pi - 6)*s^2.
area_d_factor = 3 * math.pi - 6

# Step 4: Total surface area of the cube S.
# A cube has 6 faces of area s^2 each.
area_s = 6 # in units of s^2

# Step 5: Calculate the final ratio.
# Ratio = Area(D) / Area(S) = (s^2 * (3*pi - 6)) / (6 * s^2)
# Ratio = (3*pi - 6) / 6 = pi/2 - 1
