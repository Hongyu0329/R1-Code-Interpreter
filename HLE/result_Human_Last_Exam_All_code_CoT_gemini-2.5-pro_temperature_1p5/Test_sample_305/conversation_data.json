    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of binary operations on a set of 3 elements that are both commutative and associative. We can do this by programmatically generating all possible commutative operations and then testing each one for associativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Set**: Let the set be S = {0, 1, 2}. A binary operation is a function that takes two elements from S and returns an element from S. This can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table (also known as a Cayley table).\n\n2.  **Handle Commutativity**: The commutative property states that for any two elements `x` and `y` in S, `op(x, y) = op(y, x)`. This means the multiplication table must be symmetric across its main diagonal. To define a commutative operation, we only need to specify the values for the pairs `(i, j)` where `i <= j`. For n=3, there are `3 * (3+1) / 2 = 6` such pairs: `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, and `(2,2)`.\n\n3.  **Count Commutative Operations**: Since each of these 6 entries can be any of the 3 elements in S, the total number of distinct commutative operations is 3^6 = 729.\n\n4.  **Test for Associativity**: The associative property states that for any three elements `x, y, z` in S, `op(op(x, y), z) = op(x, op(y, z))`. We will iterate through all 729 commutative operations. For each operation, we will check if the associativity equation holds for all possible `3 * 3 * 3 = 27` combinations of `(x, y, z)`.\n\n5.  **Count and Output**: We'll use a counter to keep track of how many of the 729 operations are also associative. The final count will be our answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of a given size n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n\n    # For a commutative operation, we only need to define the operation\n    # for pairs (i, j) where i <= j.
