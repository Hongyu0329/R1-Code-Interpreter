    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nHere is my plan to answer your question. The question asks for a specific historical fact. I will access my knowledge base to find information about the Piazza della Rotonda's history, specifically focusing on architectural or infrastructural changes around the year 1950.\n\nTo fulfill your request for a code-based solution, I will provide the answer using a Python script. The script will simply use the `print()` function to output the answer as a text string.\n\n```python\ndef solve_history_puzzle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the answer to the historical question about the Piazza della Rotonda.\n  \"\"\"\n  feature = \"the tram line\"\n  location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n  year = 1950\n\n  # The tramway was a prominent feature of the square, with tracks running near the fountain.\n  # It was removed as part of a post-war city plan to modernize traffic and remove tram lines\n  # from the historic center of Rome.\n  \n  answer = f\"The unique architectural feature that was removed from the {location} around {year} was {feature}.\"\n  print(answer)\n\nsolve_history_puzzle()\n```\n<<<The tram line>>>"
