# The problem is to find the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (ghtw)
# of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.

# Based on theoretical analysis, this value is a constant.
# Let H be a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges e1, e2, e3.

# 1. Lower Bound: For any decomposition of H, there must be a bag
#    containing the union of pairwise intersections of the hyperedges.
#    Let I = (e1 intersect e2) union (e1 intersect e3) union (e2 intersect e3).
#    So, ghtw(H) >= |I| - 1 (using the width definition max|bag_size|-1).

# 2. Construction for a high lower bound: We can construct a hypergraph H*
#    with 3 edges where this lower bound is 3.
#    Let V12, V13, V23, V123 be four distinct vertices.
#    e1 = {V12, V13, V123}
#    e2 = {V12, V23, V123}
#    e3 = {V13, V23, V123}
#    For this hypergraph, the set I is {V12, V13, V23, V123}, so |I|=4.
#    This gives ghtw(H*) >= 4 - 1 = 3.

# 3. Upper Bound: A known theorem in hypergraph theory states that
#    ghtw(H) <= |E|, where |E| is the number of hyperedges.
#    For any hypergraph with 3 edges, ghtw(H) <= 3.

# From (2) and (3), we conclude that the maximum generalized hypertreewidth
# for a hypergraph with 3 edges is 3.
