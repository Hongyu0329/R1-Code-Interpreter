# Final Answer Calculation

# The problem is to find lim P(V_n > 2/3) as n -> infinity.
# Let p be the limiting value (in probability) of the sausage density V_n.
# Based on the analysis of the conditioned Brownian motion, we determined the
# asymptotic sausage density.
p = 1

# The threshold value given in the problem statement.
c = sympy.Rational(2, 3)

# Since V_n converges to p, the probability P(V_n > c) converges to:
# 1 if p > c
# 0 if p < c
# 1/2 if p = c (under assumptions of a Central Limit Theorem)

# Here, we compare the values of p and c.
if p > c:
    final_answer = 1
elif p < c:
    final_answer = 0
else:
    final_answer = sympy.Rational(1, 2)

# The question asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The "equation" is the comparison p > c, which leads to the final answer.
