    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to compute the determinant of the given matrix:\n\n1.  **Identify the Matrix and Formula:** The given adjacency matrix is a 3x3 matrix. The standard formula to calculate the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n    `A = [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]` is `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n2.  **Assign Values:** I will assign the values from the given matrix to the variables `a, b, c, ... i`.\n3.  **Show the Calculation:** The Python code will substitute these values into the determinant formula and print each step of the calculation, as requested.\n4.  **Final Result:** The final computed determinant will be printed at the end.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix and shows the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given matrix is:\n    # A = [[2, -1, -1],\n    #      [-1,  2, -1],\n    #      [-1, -1,  2]]\n\n    # Assign elements to variables\n    a, b, c = 2, -1, -1\n    d, e, f = -1, 2, -1\n    g, h, i = -1, -1, 2\n\n    print(\"The given matrix A is:\")\n    A = np.array([[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]])\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nThe determinant is calculated using the formula for a 3x3 matrix:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Substitute the matrix values into the formula.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n    # Calculate the 2x2 sub-determinants\n    sub_det1 = e * i - f * h\n    sub_det2 = d * i - f * g\n    sub_det3 = d * h - e * g\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the values of the 2x2 determinants.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a})*({sub_det1}) - ({b})*({sub_det2}) + ({c})*({sub_det3})\")\n\n    # Multiply by the top row elements\n    term1 = a * sub_det1\n    term2 = b * sub_det2\n    term3 = c * sub_det3\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Perform the multiplications.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({term1}) - ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\n\n    # Calculate the final determinant\n    determinant = term1 - term2 + term3\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Sum the terms to get the final result.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {term1} - {term2} + {term3} = {determinant}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(f\"The determinant of the matrix is: {determinant}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
