    "My plan is to solve this problem by using modular arithmetic to construct the set $A$. This is a powerful technique for problems in additive combinatorics.\n\nFirst, I'll formulate a constructive approach. I'll define the set $A$ as the collection of all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that fall into specific residue classes modulo an integer $m$. Let $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$ be a set of residue classes. Then $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$. The density of this set $A$ is $|R|/m$, so we want to find $m$ and $R$ that maximize this ratio.\n\nThe condition is that for any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1+a_2$ is not a perfect square. If $a_1 \\equiv r_1 \\pmod m$ and $a_2 \\equiv r_2 \\pmod m$ (with $r_1, r_2 \\in R$), then $a_1+a_2 \\equiv r_1+r_2 \\pmod m$. If a number $K$ is a perfect square, then $K \\pmod m$ must be a quadratic residue modulo $m$. Let $S_m$ be the set of these quadratic residues. If we can find a set $R$ such that the sumset $R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod m \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$ contains no elements from $S_m$, then no sum $a_1+a_2$ can be a perfect square.\n\nSo, the task is reduced to finding an integer $m$ and a set of residues $R$ that maximizes $|R|/m$, subject to $(R+R) \\cap S_m = \\emptyset \\pmod m$.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform this search for small values of $m$. The script will:\n1.  Iterate through a range of moduli $m$.\n2.  For each $m$, calculate the set of squares, $S_m$.\n3.  Search for the largest possible set $R$ that satisfies the condition. Since this search is computationally intensive (equivalent to the maximum independent set problem on a special hypergraph), I will perform it for a limited range of $m$.\n4.  Track the best ratio $|R|/m$ found.\n5.  Finally, I will present the results from the code and provide the concluding answer based on its findings and established mathematical results.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_moser_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script tackles the problem of finding the maximum density 'c' of a set A\n    where A+A contains no square numbers.
