    "To determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore, we need to identify its start and end years.\n\n1.  **Start Year**: The war begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* in the year **2504**.\n2.  **End Year**: The main conflict concludes with the defeat of the primary antagonist, Amon, at the end of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* in the year **2506**.\n3.  **Calculation**: To find the duration in years, accounting for the fact that the war spanned across these calendar years, we subtract the start year from the end year and add one. This counts every calendar year that the war was active in. The \"rounded up\" instruction implies we should count any part of a year as a full year for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nThe calculation is: `2506 - 2504 + 1`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore started in the year 2504.\nstart_year = 2504\n\n# The war is considered to have ended with the main events of Legacy of the Void in 2506.\nend_year = 2506\n\n# The question asks for the duration in years, rounded up.\n# The most straightforward interpretation that honors the \"rounded up\" clause\n# is to count the number of calendar years the war was active in.\n# For example, a war from late 2001 to early 2003 was active in 2001, 2002, and 2003 (3 years).\n# The formula for this is: end_year - start_year + 1\nduration = (end_year - start_year) + 1\n\n# We use math.ceil to formally round up, although our calculation method already handles this.\n# For example, 2506 - 2504 = 2. But the war took place *during* 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n# This is a duration of 3 calendar years.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(f\"The Second Great War began in {start_year} and ended in {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation for the total number of calendar years the war spanned is: {end_year} - {start_year} + 1 = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the duration of the war, rounded up, was {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<3>>>"
