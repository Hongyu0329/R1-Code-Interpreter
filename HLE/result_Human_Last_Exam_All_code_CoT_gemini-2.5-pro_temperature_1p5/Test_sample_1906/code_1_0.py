    # Step 1: Understand the premise.
    # The category in question has two major sets of properties:
    # 1. Abelian: Has a zero object, biproducts, kernels, cokernels, and Hom-sets are abelian groups.
    # 2. Cartesian Closed: Has a terminal object, products, and exponential objects (internal Hom).
    
    # Step 2: The key insight.
    # A famous result in category theory states that if a category is both abelian and cartesian closed,
    # it must be a "trivial category" (equivalent to the category with one object and one identity morphism).
    
    # Step 3: Sketch of the proof leading to triviality.
    # - In such a category, for any object A, the functor (A x -) must preserve the initial object 0.
    # - This means A x 0 must be an initial object, which in an abelian category is a zero object. So, A x 0 is isomorphic to 0.
    # - This property can be used to show that the identity morphism id_A is equal to the zero morphism 0_{A,A} for any object A.
    # - If id_A = 0_{A,A}, it follows that every morphism in the category is a zero morphism,
    #   and that all objects are isomorphic to the zero object. The category is trivial.
    
    # Step 4: Evaluate the given options for a trivial category.
    # A trivial category has one object (let's call it 'Z') and one morphism (id_Z).
