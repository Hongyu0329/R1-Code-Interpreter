# Time Complexity Analysis of IMAG(n, c)

To determine the computational time complexity, we analyze the number of basic operations the algorithm performs as a function of its inputs, primarily `n` and `c`.

### 1. Cost of Basic Operations

- **Initialization (Step 1):** The lines `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;` involve a fixed number of assignments and elementary arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction). Assuming these operations take constant time for standard integer sizes, the complexity of this step is **O(1)**.

- **Inside the Loop (Step 2.1):** The body of the `while` loop, `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`, also consists of a fixed number of constant-time operations. Thus, each single iteration of the loop has a complexity of **O(1)**.

### 2. Number of Loop Iterations

The algorithm's overall complexity depends on how many times the `while` loop executes. The loop runs as long as `q > 0`.

- Let's track the value of the variable `q`.
  - Before the loop: `q` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`.
  - After 1st iteration: The new `q` is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is `⌊n/(c^2)⌋`.
  - After 2nd iteration: The new `q` is `⌊(⌊n/(c^2)⌋)/c⌋`, which is `⌊n/(c^3)⌋`.
  - After `k-1` iterations: `q` is `⌊n/(c^k)⌋`.

- The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/(c^k)⌋ = 0`, which is true when `n/(c^k) < 1`.

- To find the number of iterations `k`, we can solve the inequality:
  `n / c^k < 1`
  `n < c^k`
  `log_c(n) < k`

- This shows that the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`, which is O(log_c(n)).

### 3. Total Complexity

We can now calculate the total time complexity by combining the parts:

Total Complexity = (Complexity of Initialization) + (Number of Iterations) × (Complexity per Iteration)
Total Complexity = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) × O(1)
Total Complexity = O(1) + O(log_c(n))

In Big O notation, we only keep the most significant term. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is **O(log_c(n))**.

### The Final Equation for Complexity is:

T(n, c) = O(log_c(n))

The components of this final equation are:
- The function is a logarithm: log
- The base of the logarithm is the variable: c
- The complexity is a function of the input number: n
