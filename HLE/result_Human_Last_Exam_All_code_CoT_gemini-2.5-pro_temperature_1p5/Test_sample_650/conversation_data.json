    "My plan to determine the time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Individual Operations:** I will examine the computational cost of each step in the algorithm. The operations outside the loop (initialization) and inside the loop (assignments, arithmetic) will be evaluated. I expect these to be constant time, O(1), operations.\n2.  **Analyze the Loop:** The core of the complexity lies in the `while` loop. I need to determine how many times the loop iterates. I'll trace how the loop's control variable, `q`, changes with each iteration in relation to the inputs `n` and `c`.\n3.  **Formulate the Complexity Relation:** I'll observe that the value of `n` is effectively divided by the base `c` in each step. This repeated division suggests a logarithmic relationship. I will formalize this relationship to find the number of iterations, `k`, as a function of `n` and `c`.\n4.  **Combine and Finalize:** By combining the cost of the initial step with the total cost of the loop (number of iterations multiplied by the cost per iteration), I will derive the overall time complexity of the algorithm.\n5.  **Code the Explanation:** I will write a Python script to print this step-by-step analysis as its output, ensuring the final result is clearly stated, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef explain_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a detailed step-by-step analysis of the computational time\n    complexity for the IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n# Time Complexity Analysis of IMAG(n, c)\n\nTo determine the computational time complexity, we analyze the number of basic operations the algorithm performs as a function of its inputs, primarily `n` and `c`.\n\n### 1. Cost of Basic Operations\n\n- **Initialization (Step 1):** The lines `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;` involve a fixed number of assignments and elementary arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction). Assuming these operations take constant time for standard integer sizes, the complexity of this step is **O(1)**.\n\n- **Inside the Loop (Step 2.1):** The body of the `while` loop, `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`, also consists of a fixed number of constant-time operations. Thus, each single iteration of the loop has a complexity of **O(1)**.\n\n### 2. Number of Loop Iterations\n\nThe algorithm's overall complexity depends on how many times the `while` loop executes. The loop runs as long as `q > 0`.\n\n- Let's track the value of the variable `q`.\n  - Before the loop: `q` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`.\n  - After 1st iteration: The new `q` is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is `⌊n/(c^2)⌋`.\n  - After 2nd iteration: The new `q` is `⌊(⌊n/(c^2)⌋)/c⌋`, which is `⌊n/(c^3)⌋`.\n  - After `k-1` iterations: `q` is `⌊n/(c^k)⌋`.\n\n- The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/(c^k)⌋ = 0`, which is true when `n/(c^k) < 1`.\n\n- To find the number of iterations `k`, we can solve the inequality:\n  `n / c^k < 1`\n  `n < c^k`\n  `log_c(n) < k`\n\n- This shows that the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`, which is O(log_c(n)).\n\n### 3. Total Complexity\n\nWe can now calculate the total time complexity by combining the parts:\n\nTotal Complexity = (Complexity of Initialization) + (Number of Iterations) × (Complexity per Iteration)\nTotal Complexity = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) × O(1)\nTotal Complexity = O(1) + O(log_c(n))\n\nIn Big O notation, we only keep the most significant term. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n### The Final Equation for Complexity is:\n\nT(n, c) = O(log_c(n))\n\nThe components of this final equation are:\n- The function is a logarithm: log\n- The base of the logarithm is the variable: c\n- The complexity is a function of the input number: n\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_complexity()\n```\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
