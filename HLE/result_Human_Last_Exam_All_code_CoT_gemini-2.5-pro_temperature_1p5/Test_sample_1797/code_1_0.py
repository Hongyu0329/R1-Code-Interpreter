# The task is to identify the incorrect statement from the provided options.
# After analyzing each statement:
# A, B, D, and E are well-established facts about attack graph analysis.
# C incorrectly claims that the generation of attack graphs is an NP-hard problem.
# The primary issue is the exponential size of the state space, not the
# inherent computational complexity class of the generation algorithms themselves.

# Therefore, the incorrect statement is C.
# This script will print the final answer.

incorrect_statement = "C"
print(incorrect_statement)
