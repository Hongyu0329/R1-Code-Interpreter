# The user wants to select the correct conclusion from a list of choices based on experimental data.
# The code's role is to act as a placeholder for the reasoning process, and then print the final answer.
# The reasoning process is done in the text preceding the code block.

# Analysis of the data leads to the following key points:
# 1. SSRIs reversed the anxiety phenotype seen in mice with the ber2 mutation (deltaber2 and the double knockout).
#    This supports "The effects of mutations in ber1 and ber2 may be reversed by treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)".
# 2. Mice with only the ber2 gene knocked out (deltaber2) did not show a change in cell proliferation (3500 cells, same as WT).
#    This supports "Mice with defects in ber2 may not have a decrease in cell proliferation".
# 3. Only the double knockout mice (delta-ber1, delta-ber2) showed a decrease in cell proliferation (2850 cells).
#    This supports "Gene ber1 and ber2 regulate cell proliferation" (in a redundant manner).

# All three statements in choice A are supported by the data. Let's re-verify the other choices are incorrect.
# Choice C is incorrect because 'Gene ber2 regulates cell proliferation' is false; ber2 knockout alone had no effect.
# Choice E is incorrect because it claims SSRIs 'may not' reverse the effects, but the data shows they did for anxiety.
# Choice F is incorrect because ber2 knockout alone did not cause a decrease in cell proliferation.
# Choice H is incorrect because there is no data to support the conclusion that 'Anhedonia can be treated with SSRIs'.
