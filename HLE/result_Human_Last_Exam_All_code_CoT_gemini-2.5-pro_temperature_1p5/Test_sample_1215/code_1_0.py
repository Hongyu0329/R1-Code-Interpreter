def solve_logic_problem():
    """
    This function explains and solves the logic problem based on deduction.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of variables in a formula `psi`
    that is logically equivalent to a formula `phi`.

    Let `n` be the number of variables in `phi` (n >= 2).
    Let `k` be the number of variables `phi` actually depends on.
    Let `m` be the number of satisfying assignments for the underlying k-variable function.

    The number of satisfying assignments for `phi` is given as 2^(n-1).
    This number can also be expressed as `m * 2^(n-k)`.
    By equating these, we get: m * 2^(n-k) = 2^(n-1).
    Solving for `m`, we find the core equation relating `m` and `k`:
    m = 2^(k-1)

    We need to find the minimum integer `k >= 1` for which a boolean function
    of `k` variables can have `m = 2^(k-1)` satisfying assignments.

    k = 1
    m = 2**(k-1)
