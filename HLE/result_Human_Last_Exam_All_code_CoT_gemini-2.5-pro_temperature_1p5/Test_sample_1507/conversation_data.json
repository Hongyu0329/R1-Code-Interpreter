    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shape of the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron and then count the number of triangles on its surface.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Outer-Hull:** The outer-hull, or more formally the convex hull, of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The vertices of the great icosahedron are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the Outer-Hull's Surface:** A regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron whose surface is already composed of 20 equilateral triangles.\n3.  **Triangulation:** Since the surface is already made of triangles, the minimal triangulation is simply the set of its existing faces.\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Faces:** We can calculate the number of faces (triangles) of a regular icosahedron from its vertex properties.\n    *   A regular icosahedron has `V = 12` vertices.\n    *   At each vertex, `k = 5` triangles (and 5 edges) meet.\n    *   Each triangle has 3 vertices.\n5.  **The Formula:** We can find the total number of faces (F) using the formula `F = (V * k) / 3`.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the resulting equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the regular icosahedron, which is the\n# outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n# Number of vertices (V)\nV = 12\n# Number of triangular faces meeting at each vertex (k)\nk = 5\n# Number of vertices per triangular face (n_verts_per_face)\nn_verts_per_face = 3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of faces (F).\n# Each vertex is a part of 'k' faces. If we multiply V * k, we count each\n# face 'n_verts_per_face' times (once for each of its vertices).\n# So, we divide by 'n_verts_per_face' to get the correct number of faces.\nF = (V * k) / n_verts_per_face\n\n# Step 3: Print the explanation and the final equation.\nprint(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"The number of visible triangles is the number of faces on this icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"\\nWe can calculate the number of faces (F) using its vertex properties:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Vertices (V) = {V}\")\nprint(f\"Faces meeting at each Vertex (k) = {k}\")\nprint(f\"Vertices per Face = {n_verts_per_face}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe equation to find the total number of faces is: F = (V * k) / 3\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values:\")\n# Using int() for clean output as the result is a whole number.\nprint(f\"F = ({V} * {k}) / {n_verts_per_face} = {int(F)}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, the minimal number of triangles needed is {int(F)}.\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
