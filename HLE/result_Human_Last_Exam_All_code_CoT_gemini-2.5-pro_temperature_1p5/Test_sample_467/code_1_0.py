    Calculates the Morse index of a minimal surface given its properties.

    The problem asks for the Morse index of a minimal surface M with the following properties:
    1. It is conformally equivalent to the complex plane C. This implies the surface has
       genus g=0 and one end (k=1). The end corresponds to the point at infinity in the
       complex plane parameterization.
    2. Its Gauss map is g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).

    For a complete minimal surface of genus zero, the Morse index can be calculated using a
    formula by López and Ros:
    Index(M) = |P \ E| + |Z \ E| - 1
    where:
    - P is the set of poles of the Gauss map g(z).
    - Z is the set of zeros of the Gauss map g(z).
    - E is the set of ends of the surface. In this case, E = {infinity}.
    - |P \ E| is the number of finite poles (poles in C).
    - |Z \ E| is the number of finite zeros (zeros in C).

    We will now calculate these values.
