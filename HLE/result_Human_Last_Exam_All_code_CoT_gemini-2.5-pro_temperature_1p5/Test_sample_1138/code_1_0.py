    print("Analysis: Due to ECDSA's malleability, an adversary can easily compute a new signature 'sig' from an existing 'sig'. The probability of success is very high (essentially 1), not negligible.")

    print("Statement: For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.")

    print("\n--- Analyzing Option C ---")
    print("Statement: For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.")
    print("Analysis: This describes a universal forgery. While such insecure schemes might exist, this property does not hold for ECDSA, which is the primary example provided in the question. For ECDSA, this is infeasible. Therefore, this option is less relevant and certain than Option B.")

    print("Analysis: This claims that message recovery from a signature is always hard. This is false. A counterexample is textbook RSA signatures (without hashing), where sig = m^d mod N. Anyone with the public key can compute m = sig^e mod N, easily recovering the message.")
