    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to answer the question. The final conclusion is that if a Schwartz function has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function. The proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(z)$ of the Schwartz function $f(x)$ for a complex variable $z$.\n2.  Show that because $f$ is a Schwartz function, $\\hat{f}(z)$ is an entire (analytic on the whole complex plane) function.\n3.  Relate the given condition, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$, to the derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin, $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)$.\n4.  Use the fact that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(z)$ at $z=0$ are zero to conclude that $\\hat{f}(z)$ must be the zero function everywhere.\n5.  By the injectivity of the Fourier transform on Schwartz space, conclude that $f(x)$ must also be the zero function.\n\nThis logical progression will be presented in the Python code below.\n\n```python\ndef solve_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by providing a step-by-step mathematical proof.\n\n    The question is: If f is a Schwartz function such that all its moments\n    are zero, does it follow that f must be identically zero?\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Yes, it follows that f = 0.
