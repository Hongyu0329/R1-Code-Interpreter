    print("Yes, it follows that f = 0. Here is the proof:\n")

    print("Let f(x) be a Schwartz function. The Fourier transform of f is defined as:")
    print("  f_hat(xi) = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * exp(-2 * pi * i * x * xi) dx")
    print("Because f(x) is a Schwartz function (decays faster than any polynomial),")
    print("its Fourier transform can be extended to an entire function on the complex plane C:")
    print("  f_hat(z) = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * exp(-2 * pi * i * x * z) dx, for z in C.")

    print("  d^k/dz^k [f_hat(z)] = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * d^k/dz^k [exp(-2 * pi * i * x * z)] dx")
    print("  d^k/dz^k [f_hat(z)] = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * (-2 * pi * i * x)^k * exp(-2 * pi * i * x * z) dx")

    print("  f_hat^(k)(0) = (-2 * pi * i)^k * (integral from -inf to +inf of x^k * f(x) dx)\n")

    print("Step 3: Use the given condition")
    print("We are given that all moments of f(x) are zero:")
    print("  integral from -inf to +inf of x^k * f(x) dx = 0, for all k = 0, 1, 2, ...")
    print("Substituting this into our equation for the derivatives of the Fourier transform:")
    # The loop prints the equation for a few values of k to demonstrate the result.

    print("  ... and so on for all k.")
    print("This means that all the derivatives of the function f_hat(z) at the point z = 0 are zero.\n")

    print("The Fourier transform is an isomorphism on the space of Schwartz functions, meaning it is a one-to-one mapping.")
    print("The only function whose Fourier transform is the zero function is the zero function itself.")
