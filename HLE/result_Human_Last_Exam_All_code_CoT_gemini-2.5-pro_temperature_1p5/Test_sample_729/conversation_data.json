    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Group:** The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$. This group can be defined by the presentation $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. This is denoted as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Powers of Elements:** We will compute the set $G^k$ for different integers $k$. We can classify the integers $k$ into two cases: odd and even.\n    *   **Case 1: $k$ is odd.** For any element $g \\in Q_{128}$, its $k$-th power $g^k$ will be computed. It can be shown that the set of all such powers, $G^k$, is equal to the entire group $Q_{128}$ itself. This gives us one unique power subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2: $k$ is even.** For any even integer $k$, the set $G^k$ forms a cyclic subgroup within the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$. Specifically, $G^k = \\langle x^{\\text{gcd}(k, 64)} \\rangle$. Since $k$ must be even, the greatest common divisor, $\\text{gcd}(k, 64)$, must be an even divisor of 64.\n\n4.  **Count the Subgroups:** By identifying all possible distinct subgroups arising from these two cases, we can find the total count.\n    *   The odd exponents give 1 subgroup ($Q_{128}$).\n    *   The even exponents give subgroups corresponding to the even divisors of 64. The even divisors of 64 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Each of these gives a distinct cyclic subgroup. This gives us 6 more subgroups.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 128\n\n    # The generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n} has order 2^n.\n    # For Q_128, 128 = 2^7, so n=7.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n\n    # The presentation of Q_{2^n} is <x, y | x^(2^(n-1)) = 1, x^(2^(n-2)) = y^2, ...>\n    # The order of the cyclic subgroup <x> is 2^(n-1).\n    cyclic_subgroup_order = 2**(n - 1)\n\n    print(f\"For the generalized quaternion group Q_{group_order}:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Case 1: The exponent k is odd.\n    # For any odd k, the power subgroup G^k = {g^k | g in G} is the group G itself.\n    # This accounts for one power subgroup.\n    count_from_odd_exponents = 1\n    print(\"1.
