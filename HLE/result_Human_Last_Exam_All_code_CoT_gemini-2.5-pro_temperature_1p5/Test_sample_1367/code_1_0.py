def solve_vertex_algebra_questions():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the theoretical questions about the vertex algebra V(p).
    The logic for each answer is as follows:

    (a) The vertex algebra V(p), known as the singlet algebra, is simple if and only if the integer p > 1.
        For p=1, V(p) is not simple. Therefore, the statement "V(p) is simple for all p >= 1" is false.

    (b) A non-trivial ideal in a vertex algebra with a conformal vector is, by definition, a module for the
        associated Virasoro algebra (L_k(sl_2) in this case). Furthermore, the existence of such an ideal
        relies on the presence of a singular vector that generates it. Thus, an ideal must meet both conditions.

    (c) Simplicity of a vertex algebra is a stronger condition than its irreducibility as a module over a subalgebra
        (like the Virasoro algebra). For p >= 2, V(p) is simple as a vertex algebra, but it decomposes into a
        direct sum of multiple irreducible L_k(sl_2)-modules. A direct sum of modules is a reducible module.
        Therefore, simplicity does not imply irreducibility.
