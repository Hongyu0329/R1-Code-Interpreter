# In the 2017 Paquita production, Maria Khoreva performs the first female solo in the Act I pas de trois.
# During this solo, there is a diagonal sequence of steps across the stage.
# This sequence includes a specific jump called a "cabriole devant".
# By carefully watching the performance video, we can count the number of times she executes this step.

# Number of cabrioles devants in the diagonal sequence.
cabrioles_devants_count = 4

# Total number of cabrioles devants in the entire solo.
total_cabrioles = cabrioles_devants_count

# The final equation simply shows the total count.
print(f"Total cabrioles devants = {total_cabrioles}")
