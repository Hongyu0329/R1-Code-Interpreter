# The total number of colors available.
total_colors = 3

# The number of colors that cannot be in the x,y plane.
# As per the rules, an Orange cube can only be placed adjacent to a White cube in the z-direction,
# meaning it will always be on a different z-level from the White cube it attaches to.
# Therefore, Orange cubes cannot be part of the plane itself.
excluded_colors = 1

# Calculate the number of colors available for constructing the plane.
plane_colors_count = total_colors - excluded_colors

# The final result is the cardinality of the set of colors in the plane.
# We need at least two colors {White, Blue} because a plane of only White cubes cannot be constructed
# (the rule for adding a White cube requires two neighbors of different colors).
# Thus, the minimum number of colors required is 2.
