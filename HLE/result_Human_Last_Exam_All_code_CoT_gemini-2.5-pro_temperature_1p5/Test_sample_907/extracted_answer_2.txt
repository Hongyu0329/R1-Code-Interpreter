The equation for the absorption cross-section (σ_abs) for a chain of molecules is given by:

Symbols represent:
  C: Proportionality constant
  N: Number of molecules
  μ₀: Transition dipole moment of a single molecule
  E_trans: Transition energy of a single molecule
  ħ: Reduced Planck constant
  ω_L: Laser pulse central frequency
  τ: Laser pulse duration
  J: Near-neighbor coupling energy

----------------------------------------------------------
a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected:
----------------------------------------------------------
         │ 2│   ⎛         2⎞
         │μ₀│ ⋅ ⎜  (E_trans - ħ⋅ω_L) ⋅τ ⎟
σ_abs = C⋅N   ⋅ℯ⎝- ──────────────────────⎠
           2 
          ħ  

Here, the absorption peak is centered at the single-molecule transition energy E_trans.

----------------------------------------------------------
b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered:
----------------------------------------------------------
         │ 2│   ⎛           2⎞
         │μ₀│ ⋅ ⎜(2⋅J + E_trans - ħ⋅ω_L) ⋅τ⎟
σ_abs = C⋅N   ⋅ℯ⎝- ─────────────────────────⎠
            2 
           ħ  

Here, the absorption peak is shifted to E_trans + 2J due to exciton formation.
