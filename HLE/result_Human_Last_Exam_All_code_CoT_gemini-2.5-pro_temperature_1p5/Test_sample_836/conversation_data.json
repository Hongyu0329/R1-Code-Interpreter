    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the function you are referring to, which is the generalized pair correlation function, typically denoted as $g(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, t)$. This function represents the probability density of detecting a neutron at position $\\mathbf{r}_2$ at time $t$, given that a neutron was detected at position $\\mathbf{r}_1$ at time $t=0$.\n\nSecond, I will define the mathematical operation you requested: a space-time, double Fourier transform. This involves applying a Fourier transform with respect to both spatial variables ($\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$) and the time variable ($t$).\n\nThird, under the common and physically relevant assumption of a homogeneous system (where the physics are the same everywhere), the correlation function simplifies. It no longer depends on the absolute positions $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$, but only on their relative separation vector, $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$. The function becomes $g(\\mathbf{r}, t)$.\n\nFinally, applying the Fourier transform to this simplified function, $g(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, with respect to both $\\mathbf{r}$ and $t$ yields a new function of wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ and frequency $\\omega$. I will provide the common name for this resulting function, which is well-established in both physics and nuclear engineering.\n\nThe Python code below will print out this step-by-step reasoning and state the final name for the transformed function.\n\n```python\ndef get_transform_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and identifies the space-time Fourier transform of the\n    generalized pair correlation function in nuclear criticality.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
