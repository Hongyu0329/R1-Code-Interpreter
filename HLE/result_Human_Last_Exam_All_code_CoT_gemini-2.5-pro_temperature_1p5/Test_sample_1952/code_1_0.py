    # By Koenig's theorem, k < cf(2^k), which implies k+ <= 2^k.

    # Substituting the values: |max({cov(N_k), 2^k}) \ cov(N_k)|.
    # Since cov(N_k) <= 2^k, this is |2^k \ cov(N_k)|.
    print(f"Step 3: Evaluate the expression |max({{lambda, mu}}) \\ lambda|.")

    # Step 4: Maximize the result.
    # The cardinality |2^k \ cov(N_k)| is 2^k if 2^k > cov(N_k), and 0 otherwise.
    # To maximize this, we need a model of ZFC where 2^k > cov(N_k).
    # Such models exist. For instance, it's consistent that cov(N_k) = k+ while 2^k = k++.
    # In such a model, the value is 2^k.
    # This is the maximum possible value.
