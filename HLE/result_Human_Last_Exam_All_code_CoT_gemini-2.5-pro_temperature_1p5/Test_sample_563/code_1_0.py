    This function provides the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups
    for compact, connected Riemann surfaces of genus g = 2, 3, and 4.
    
    The problem of classifying these groups is a complex mathematical one. The values
    provided here are based on established and published results in algebraic geometry
    and group theory, compiled from sources such as papers by S. A. Broughton
    and E. Bujalance et al.
