    # Evidence 2: DRN Inhibition Experiment
    print("2. Evidence from the 'DRN Inhibition' experiment:")
    print("   - Action: Inhibiting DRN activity.")
    print("   - Result: Neural stem cell reactivation is DELAYED, but not blocked.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This suggests the pathway to the DRNs (A) modulates the process, but is not the primary driving source. If it were, reactivation would fail, not just be delayed.")

    # Evidence 3: Bovine Insulin Experiment
    print("3. Evidence from the 'Bovine Insulin' experiment:")
    print("   - Action: An isolated brain is incubated in bovine insulin (a Dilp2 analog).")
    print("   - Result: Neural stem cells are reactivated.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This demonstrates that an external, circulating factor is SUFFICIENT to cause reactivation, strongly supporting the role of hemolymph Dilp2.")

    # Final Synthesis
    print("Synthesis:")
    print("The hemolymph pathway (B) is shown to be both necessary and sufficient to drive reactivation.")
    print("The neuronal pathway to DRNs (A) appears to be modulatory, affecting the timing, but is not sufficient on its own, nor is its blockage enough to prevent reactivation entirely.")
    print("\nTherefore, the primary source of Dilp2 that drives reactivation is the one secreted into the hemolymph.")
    print("\nThe correct answer is B.")
