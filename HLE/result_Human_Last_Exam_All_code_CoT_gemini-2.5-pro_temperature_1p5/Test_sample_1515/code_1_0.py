    explanation = """
The Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (NSVZ) beta function is an exact expression for the running of the gauge coupling in certain supersymmetric gauge theories. Its validity is not absolute but depends critically on the chosen regularization and renormalization scheme.

The core of N=1 supersymmetry lies in its holomorphic structure. Key objects, such as the superpotential and the gauge kinetic function, are holomorphic functions of chiral superfields and the complex gauge coupling, respectively. The powerful non-renormalization theorems of supersymmetry are a direct consequence of this holomorphy.

The NSVZ beta function can be derived by relating the beta function to the anomalous dimensions of the matter fields. This derivation crucially relies on Ward identities that are only maintained if the regularization procedure respects the underlying holomorphic structure of the theory.

If a scheme (like standard dimensional regularization) breaks holomorphy, the simple and exact form of the NSVZ beta function is lost. However, in schemes that are designed to preserve it (so-called "holomorphic schemes" like dimensional reduction), the relationship holds exactly.

Therefore, the precise condition for the NSVZ beta function to be exact and compatible with non-renormalization theorems is that the regularization scheme must preserve the holomorphy properties of the theory.
