    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### **Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compute the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. The 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n2.  **Interpret the Task:** Computing an N-point DFT of a sequence with more than N points is not standard. The common interpretation in digital signal processing is to first reduce the longer sequence to an N-point sequence through a process called **time-aliasing**. This involves \"wrapping\" the sequence and adding it to itself.\n    So, we'll create a new 4-point sequence, `z(n)`, by adding the second half of `y(n)` to its first half:\n    `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n3.  **Construct the Aliased Sequence `z(n)`:**\n    Let's write out the terms for `z(n)`:\n    *   `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n    *   `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n    *   `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n    *   `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\n4.  **Relate `Z(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`:**\n    We need to find `Z(k)`, the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`. Instead of first finding `x(n)` and `h(n)` by inverse DFT (which can be tedious and reveals an inconsistency in the problem's given `H(k)` values), we can find a direct relationship between `Z(k)` and the given DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n    Let's analyze the expression for each `Z(k)` term:\n    *   `Z(0) = z(0) + z(1) + z(2) + z(3)`\n        `= (x(0)+x(2)) + (h(0)+h(2)) + (x(1)+x(3)) + (h(1)+h(3))`\n        `= (x(0)+x(1)+x(2)+x(3)) + (h(0)+h(1)+h(2)+h(3))`\n        Since `X(0) = Σx(n)` and `H(0) = Σh(n)`, we get:\n        `Z(0) = X(0) + H(0)`\n\n    *   `Z(2) = z(0) - z(1) + z(2) - z(3)`\n        `= (x(0)+x(2)) - (h(0)+h(2)) + (x(1)+x(3)) - (h(1)+h(3))`\n        `= (x(0)+x(1)+x(2)+x(3)) - (h(0)+h(1)+h(2)+h(3))`\n        `Z(2) = X(0) - H(0)`\n\n    *   `Z(1) = z(0) - j*z(1) - z(2) + j*z(3)`\n        `= (x(0)+x(2)) - j*(h(0)+h(2)) - (x(1)+x(3)) + j*(h(1)+h(3))`\n        `= (x(0)-x(1)+x(2)-x(3)) - j*(h(0)-h(1)+h(2)-h(3))`\n        Since `X(2) = x(0)-x(1)+x(2)-x(3)` and `H(2) = h(0)-h(1)+h(2)-h(3)`, we get:\n        `Z(1) = X(2) - j*H(2)`\n\n    *   `Z(3) = z(0) + j*z(1) - z(2) - j*z(3)`\n        `= (x(0)+x(2)) + j*(h(0)+h(2)) - (x(1)+x(3)) - j*(h(1)+h(3))`\n        `= (x(0)-x(1)+x(2)-x(3)) + j*(h(0)-h(1)+h(2)-h(3))`\n        `Z(3) = X(2) + j*H(2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Values:**\n    Now we can substitute the given values for `X(k)` and `H(k)` into these derived formulas to get the final answer.\n    *   Given `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n    *   Given `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\n    This approach is robust because it relies only on the given frequency-domain data and the properties of the DFT.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 4-point DFT for the specified interleaved sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\n    H = np.array([0, 1+1j, 1, 1-1j])\n\n    # The resulting 4-point DFT, which we will calculate\n    Z = np.zeros(4, dtype=np.complex128)\n\n    print(\"Thinking Steps and Formulas:\")\n    print(\"1.

The aliased 4-point sequence z(n) can be related to X(k) and H(k) in the frequency domain.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate Z(0)\n    Z[0] = X[0] + H[0]\n    print(f\"Z[0] = X[0] + H[0] = {X[0].real} + {H[0].real} = {Z[0]}\")\n\n    # Calculate Z[1]\n    Z[1] = X[2] - 1j * H[2]\n    print(f\"Z[1] = X[2] - j*H[2] = ({X[2]}) - 1j*({H[2]}) = {Z[1]}\")\n\n    # Calculate Z(2)\n    Z[2] = X[0] - H[0]\n    print(f\"Z[2] = X[0] - H[0] = {X[0].real} - {H[0].real} = {Z[2]}\")\n\n    # Calculate Z(3)\n    Z[3] = X[2] + 1j * H[2]\n    print(f\"Z[3] = X[2] + j*H[2] = ({X[2]}) + 1j*({H[2]}) = {Z[3]}\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Final 4-point DFT Z(k):\")\n    print(Z)\n\nsolve_dft_problem()\n```\n<<<[ 1.+0.j -1.-1.j  1.+0.j -1.+1.j]>>>"
