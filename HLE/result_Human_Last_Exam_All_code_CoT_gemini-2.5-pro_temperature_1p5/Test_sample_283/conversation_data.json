    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the HSS Matrix Structure:** A Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix is represented by a tree structure. For this problem, we'll assume the standard binary tree partitioning of matrix indices.\n2.  **Interpret \"Depth 4\":** In computer science, a tree's depth is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. A root node is at level 0. A tree with \"depth 4\" has its leaves at level 4, meaning it has levels 0, 1, 2, 3 (internal nodes) and 4 (leaf nodes).\n3.  **Count Submatrices for a Single HSS Matrix:** An HSS matrix is defined by two types of submatrices:\n    *   **Off-diagonal blocks:** For each *internal node* in the tree, its corresponding matrix block is partitioned, creating two off-diagonal blocks that are represented in a compressed low-rank format. We count each of these as one submatrix. The number of internal nodes at level `k` in the binary tree is `2^k`.\n    *   **Diagonal blocks:** At the *leaf nodes* of the tree, the corresponding diagonal blocks are stored as standard dense matrices. The number of leaf nodes at depth `d` is `2^d`.\n4.  **Count for Matrix Multiplication:** The operation `C = A * B` requires accessing the defining submatrices of both input matrices, `A` and `B`. Therefore, the total number of accessed submatrices is twice the number of submatrices in a single HSS matrix representation.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python script will calculate these quantities step-by-step:\n    *   Calculate the number of internal nodes by summing `2^k` from `k=0` to `d-1` (where `d=4`).\n    *   Calculate the number of off-diagonal blocks (`2 * number of internal nodes`).\n    *   Calculate the number of leaf blocks (`2^d`).\n    *   Sum these to find the submatrices per matrix, then multiply by 2 for the total.\n    *   Finally, print the step-by-step calculation in a clear equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_multiplication():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two HSS matrices represented by a tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the HSS tree, as specified in the problem.\n    # A tree of depth 4 has levels 0, 1, 2, 3 (internal) and level 4 (leaves).\n    depth = 4\n\n    # --- Calculation for one HSS matrix ---\n\n    # 1.
