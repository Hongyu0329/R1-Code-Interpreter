# Plan:
# 1. Define the composer's surname.
# 2. Define the opus number of the concerto.
# 3. Define the string representing the range of measures for the musical joke.
# 4. Print the three elements in a comma-separated format.

composer_surname = "Beethoven"
opus_number = 15
measure_range = "365-368"

# The musical joke occurs in the Rondo of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, Op. 15.
# In measure 365, the cellos and basses begin a flourish that is one beat too long.
# This causes them to be off-beat for measures 366 and 367.
# They recover in measure 368 by skipping a beat.

print(f"{composer_surname}, {opus_number}, {measure_range}")
