# Based on the mathematical derivation, the rank of the equivariant cohomology group
# H_{SO(4)}^k(SO(4) \ X) is 0 for all degrees k.
# Therefore, the sum of the ranks for k from 0 to 100 is also 0.
# The python code will simply output this result.

total_rank = 0

# The problem asks us to show the final equation.
# In this case, the calculation is conceptually derived rather than numerically computed.
# The sum can be represented as:
# Total Rank = sum_{k=0 to 100} rank(H^k)
# Since rank(H^k) = 0 for all k, the sum is 0.
