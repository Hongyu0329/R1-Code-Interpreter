    "My plan is to solve this problem by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Theory**: The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula.\n\n2.  **Generate Partitions**: I will first write a function to generate all integer partitions of $n=25$. An integer partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers. For example, for $n=4$, the partitions are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), and (1,1,1,1).\n\n3.  **Implement the Hook Length Formula**: For each partition, I will calculate the dimension of its corresponding irrep. The formula is:\n    $$ \\text{dim}(\\lambda) = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h(i,j)} $$\n    where the product in the denominator is over the hook lengths of all the boxes in the Young diagram of the partition $\\lambda$. The hook length of a box is the number of boxes to its right, plus the number of boxes below it, plus the box itself. I will implement this calculation using integer arithmetic to maintain precision with the large numbers involved (like $25!$).\n\n4.  **Filter and Count**: I will iterate through all partitions of 25. For each one, I'll calculate its dimension. If the dimension is strictly less than 500,000, I will count it and print the details of the calculation as requested.\n\n5.  **Final Output**: Finally, I will print the total count of such irreps.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_partitions(n, min_part=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n.\n    Yields partitions with parts in non-decreasing order.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        yield []\n        return\n    if n < min_part:\n        return\n    \n    # Iterate through possible first parts `i`\n    for i in range(min_part, n + 1):\n        # Recursively find partitions for the remainder `n-i`\n        for sub_partition in generate_partitions(n - i, i):\n            yield [i] + sub_partition\n\ndef calculate_dimension_and_hooks(partition, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of an irrep of S_n using the Hook Length Formula.\n    The input partition must be sorted in descending order.\n    \n    Returns a tuple containing:\n    (dimension, numerator, denominator, list_of_hook_lengths)\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = math.factorial(n)\n    denominator = 1\n    hook_lengths = []\n    \n    for r in range(len(partition)):  # r is the 0-indexed row number\n        for c in range(partition[r]):  # c is the 0-indexed column number\n            \n            # 1.
