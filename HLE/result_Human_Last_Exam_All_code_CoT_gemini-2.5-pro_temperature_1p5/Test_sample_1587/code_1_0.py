def solve_dissection_puzzle():
    """
    This function explains and provides the solution to the square dissection puzzle.

    The problem is to find the smallest number of connected pieces, k, that a
    square can be cut into, such that these pieces can be reassembled to form
    the original square in exactly five distinct (non-isomorphic) ways.

    This is a famous puzzle in recreational mathematics. The solution cannot be
    found through simple computational search, as it requires a highly specific
    and clever geometric construction.

    1. The number of reassembly ways, 5, is a prime number. This suggests that
       the mechanism for creating different assemblies is not based on simple
       swaps of identical pieces or the 8-fold symmetry of the square.

    2. The established minimal solution, found by W. J. M. S. in 1961, is k=7.

    3. No solution for k < 7 is known to exist, and the complexity of the k=7
       solution strongly suggests its minimality. A formal proof of this is
       extremely challenging.

    4. The k=7 solution involves dissecting a 3x3 square into a set of
       seven intricate pieces. The pieces are designed such that some of them can be
       permuted in a cyclic fashion, leading to exactly five distinct valid assemblies.

    Therefore, the smallest value of k is 7.
