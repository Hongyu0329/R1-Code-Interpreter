    This function calculates the coefficient of the 3rd term of the nonlinear frequency correction.
    
    The nonlinear frequency correction coefficient, Omega, is derived using the method of multiple scales
    on the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. The result is a function of the polytropic index gamma.
    
    The expression for Omega(gamma) is:
    Omega(gamma) = C1 * gamma^(5/2) + C2 * gamma^(3/2) + C3 * gamma^(1/2)
    
    This function calculates the coefficients C1, C2, and C3, and based on the interpretation
    that the "3rd term" refers to the third component of this expression, it returns the value of C3.
