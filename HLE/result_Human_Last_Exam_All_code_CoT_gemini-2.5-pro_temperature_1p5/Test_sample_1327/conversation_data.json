    "To solve this problem, I will find the underlying pattern in the sequence.\n\n### Step-by-step Deriviation:\n1.  **Analyze the sequence**: The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  **Look for a simple pattern**: Simple arithmetic or geometric progressions do not fit. For example, the differences are 9, 12, 28, 68, which doesn't follow a simple rule.\n3.  **Look for a more complex pattern**: Let's try to relate each term `a_n` to a power of 2, as this is common in such puzzles. I'll test the hypothesis that the terms are close to powers of 2.\n    *   `11` is close to `2^3 = 8`. `11 = 8 + 3`.\n    *   `23` is close to `2^4 = 16`. `23 = 16 + 7`.\n    *   `51` is close to `2^5 = 32`. `51 = 32 + 19`.\n    *   `119` is close to `2^6 = 64`. `119 = 64 + 55`.\n4.  **Identify the primary pattern**: The pattern appears to be `a_n = 2^(n+1) + b_n` for `n â‰¥ 2` (where `a_2` is the second term, etc.). The sequence of added numbers `b_n` is 3, 7, 19, 55.\n5.  **Identify the secondary pattern**: Now, let's find the rule for the sequence `b_n` = (3, 7, 19, 55).\n    *   `7 = 3 * 3 - 2`\n    *   `19 = 3 * 7 - 2`\n    *   `55 = 3 * 19 - 2`\n    The pattern is `b_k = 3 * b_{k-1} - 2`. This holds true for the entire sequence `b`.\n6.  **Apply the pattern to find the next term**:\n    *   First, we need to find the next number in the secondary sequence (`b_5`): `3 * 55 - 2 = 165 - 2 = 163`.\n    *   Next, we apply the primary pattern to find the next term in the main sequence (`a_6`): This will be `2^(6+1) + 163`.\n    *   `2^7 + 163 = 128 + 163 = 291`.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this logic by verifying the pattern and then calculating the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a two-part pattern.\n    The main pattern is a_n = 2^(n+1) + b_k\n    The secondary pattern for b_k is b_k = 3 * b_{k-1} - 2\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"Given sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Discovering the pattern.\")\n    print(\"The pattern (starting from the 2nd term) is: a_n = 2^(n+1) + b, where b follows its own pattern.\")\n    \n    # Verify the pattern for existing terms\n    # n=2: a_2 = 11. b is 11 - 2^(2+1) = 11 - 8 = 3\n    b = 3\n    print(f\"For n=2: {sequence[1]} = 2^(2+1) + {b} = 8 + {b}\")\n\n    # n=3: a_3 = 23.
