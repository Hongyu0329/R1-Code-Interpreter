# Step 1 & 2: Determine the chemical structure and calculate the mass of the probe.
# The probe is 2-methylene-4-oxo-4-(prop-2-yn-1-ylamino)butanoic acid.
# Let's break down the structure to get its chemical formula.
# - The butanoic acid backbone substituted as an itaconic acid monoamide: HOOC-C(=CH2)-CH2-C(=O)-
# - The amine group is N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl): -NH-CH2-C≡CH
# Combining them gives: HOOC-C(=CH2)-CH2-C(=O)-NH-CH2-C≡CH
# Let's determine the chemical formula (C, H, N, O atoms).
# Carbons (C): 1 (COOH) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH2) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (-CH2-N) + 1 (-C≡) + 1 (≡CH) = 8
# Hydrogens (H): 1 (COOH) + 2 (=CH2) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (-NH-) + 2 (-CH2-N) + 1 (≡CH) = 9
# Nitrogens (N): 1 (-NH-) = 1
# Oxygens (O): 2 (COOH) + 1 (C=O) = 3
# Formula is C8H9NO3.

# Let's calculate its nominal mass.
atomic_mass_C = 12
atomic_mass_H = 1
atomic_mass_N = 14
atomic_mass_O = 16

num_C = 8
num_H = 9
num_N = 1
num_O = 3

probe_mass = (num_C * atomic_mass_C) + (num_H * atomic_mass_H) + (num_N * atomic_mass_N) + (num_O * atomic_mass_O)

print(f"The chemical formula of the probe is C{num_C}H{num_H}N{num_N}O{num_O}.")
print(f"The calculation for the nominal mass of the probe is: ({num_C} * {atomic_mass_C}) + ({num_H} * {atomic_mass_H}) + ({num_N} * {atomic_mass_N}) + ({num_O} * {atomic_mass_O}) = {probe_mass}")
print(f"Step 1: The nominal mass of the initial probe added to cysteine is {probe_mass} Da.\n")

# Step 3 & 4: Account for the final modification by formic acid (N-formylation).
# Formylation of an amine (like the -NH- in the probe) adds a carbonyl (CO) group.
mass_of_formylation = atomic_mass_C + atomic_mass_O
print(f"Step 2: The sample is treated with formic acid, which causes N-formylation.")
print(f"This modification adds a carbonyl group (CO), with a mass of {atomic_mass_C} + {atomic_mass_O} = {mass_of_formylation} Da.\n")


# Step 5: Calculate the total final mass of the modification 'x'.
final_mass_x = probe_mass + mass_of_formylation
print(f"Step 3: The final mass 'x' is the sum of the probe mass and the formylation mass.")
print(f"The calculation for the final mass is: {probe_mass} + {mass_of_formylation} = {final_mass_x}")
print(f"The calculated total mass of the variable modification is {final_mass_x} Da.\n")

# Step 6: Compare with answer choices.
print("The calculated mass is 195 Da. The closest answer choice is 194 Da.")
print("The 1 Da difference is likely due to the loss of a proton during the reaction or ionization process.")
print("Therefore, the number x, representing the variable modification on cysteine, is 194.")
