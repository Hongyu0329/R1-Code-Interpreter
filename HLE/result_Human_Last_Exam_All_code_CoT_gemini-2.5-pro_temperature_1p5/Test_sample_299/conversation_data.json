    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the properties of f.**\n    *   Show that $f$ must be injective (one-to-one). If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp$ is injective, $x_1=x_2$.\n    *   Since $f$ is a continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n    *   Rule out the case where $f$ is decreasing. A continuous, decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point (its graph must cross the line $y=x$). If $f(x_0) = x_0$ for some $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would mean $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$, but this equation has no real solutions. Therefore, $f$ cannot be decreasing.\n    *   Conclude that any solution $f$ must be strictly increasing.\n\n2.  **Characterize the solutions.**\n    *   Since $f$ is increasing, if $f(x) \\le x$ for some $x$, then $f(f(x)) \\le f(x) \\le x$, which means $\\exp(x) \\le x$. This is never true. Thus, $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Consider the value of $f(0)$. Let $a = f(0)$. Since $f(x)>x$, we have $a > 0$.\n    *   From the original equation, $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$. This means $f(a) = 1$.\n    *   Since $f$ is strictly increasing and $a>0$, we have $f(a) > f(0)$, which implies $1 > a$. So, for any solution $f$, its value at $x=0$ is a constant $a \\in (0,1)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the set of solutions.**\n    *   The construction of a solution $f$ depends on the choice of $a=f(0) \\in (0,1)$ and the behavior of $f$ on the interval $[0, a]$.\n    *   The function $f$ maps the interval $[0,a]$ to the interval $[f(0), f(a)] = [a,1]$. Since $f$ is continuous and strictly increasing, this mapping, let's call it $h = f|_{[0,a]}$, is a bijection from $[0,a]$ to $[a,1]$.\n    *   It turns out that any continuous, strictly increasing bijection $h: [0,a] \\to [a,1]$ can be used to define a unique global solution $f$. The function $f$ can be extended from its definition on $[0,a]$ to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the relations $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$ and a necessary derived property, $f(\\exp x) = \\exp(f x)$.\n    *   This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of solutions and the set of pairs $(a, h)$, where $a \\in (0,1)$ and $h: [0,a] \\to [a,1]$ is a continuous increasing bijection.\n\n4.  **Determine the cardinality.**\n    *   The number of choices for $a \\in (0,1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n    *   For any fixed $a$, the number of possible functions $h$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$. We can, for example, define a different function for each possible value of $h(a/2) \\in (a,1)$.\n    *   The total number of solutions is the cardinality of the set of these pairs, which is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the problem.\n\n    The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of continuous functions\n    f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n\n    Let S be the set of such functions.\n\n    1. Any function f in S must be strictly increasing.\n       - f is injective, so it's strictly monotonic.\n       - If f were decreasing, it would have a fixed point x_0.\n         f(x_0) = x_0 => f(f(x_0)) = x_0 => exp(x_0) = x_0, which has no solution.\n       - Thus, f must be strictly increasing.\n\n    2. For any f in S, f(x) > x for all x.\n       - If f(x) <= x, then f(f(x)) <= f(x) <= x, which means exp(x) <= x, which is false.\n\n    3. For any f in S, let a = f(0).\n       - From f(x) > x, we get a = f(0) > 0.\n       - f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1, which means f(a) = 1.\n       - Since f is increasing and a > 0, we have f(a) > f(0), which implies 1 > a.\n       - So, for each solution f, there's a unique number a = f(0) in (0, 1).\n\n    4. The construction of a solution f depends on:\n       a) The choice of a = f(0) from the interval (0, 1).\n       b) The choice of a continuous, strictly increasing bijection h from [0, a] to [a, 1].\n          This h defines f on the interval [0, a].\n\n    5. The entire function f can be uniquely extended to all of R from its definition\n       on [0, a]. This establishes a bijection between the set of solutions S and the\n       set of all possible pairs (a, h).\n\n    6. The cardinality of the set of choices is calculated as follows:\n       - The number of choices for 'a' in (0, 1) is the cardinality of the continuum, c.\n       - For each 'a', the number of choices for the function 'h' is also c.\n       - The total number of solutions is c * c = c.\n\n    The cardinality of the set of these continuous functions is c, the cardinality of the continuum.\n    The continuum is the set of real numbers, and its cardinality is also denoted by 2^{\\aleph_0}.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The cardinality is that of the continuum.\n    # It is denoted by 'c' or |R| or 2^aleph_0.\n    cardinality_symbol = \"c\"\n    cardinality_description = \"the cardinality of the continuum\"\n    \n    print(f\"The cardinality of the set of continuous functions f(f(x)) = exp(x) is {cardinality_symbol} ({cardinality_description}).\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<c>>>"
