    This function explains the solution to the problem.

    The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of continuous functions
    f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).

    Let S be the set of such functions.

    1. Any function f in S must be strictly increasing.
       - f is injective, so it's strictly monotonic.
       - If f were decreasing, it would have a fixed point x_0.
         f(x_0) = x_0 => f(f(x_0)) = x_0 => exp(x_0) = x_0, which has no solution.
       - Thus, f must be strictly increasing.

    2. For any f in S, f(x) > x for all x.
       - If f(x) <= x, then f(f(x)) <= f(x) <= x, which means exp(x) <= x, which is false.

    3. For any f in S, let a = f(0).
       - From f(x) > x, we get a = f(0) > 0.
       - f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1, which means f(a) = 1.
       - Since f is increasing and a > 0, we have f(a) > f(0), which implies 1 > a.
       - So, for each solution f, there's a unique number a = f(0) in (0, 1).

    4. The construction of a solution f depends on:
       a) The choice of a = f(0) from the interval (0, 1).
       b) The choice of a continuous, strictly increasing bijection h from [0, a] to [a, 1].
          This h defines f on the interval [0, a].

    5. The entire function f can be uniquely extended to all of R from its definition
       on [0, a]. This establishes a bijection between the set of solutions S and the
       set of all possible pairs (a, h).

    6. The cardinality of the set of choices is calculated as follows:
       - The number of choices for 'a' in (0, 1) is the cardinality of the continuum, c.
       - For each 'a', the number of choices for the function 'h' is also c.
       - The total number of solutions is c * c = c.

    The cardinality of the set of these continuous functions is c, the cardinality of the continuum.
    The continuum is the set of real numbers, and its cardinality is also denoted by 2^{\aleph_0}.
