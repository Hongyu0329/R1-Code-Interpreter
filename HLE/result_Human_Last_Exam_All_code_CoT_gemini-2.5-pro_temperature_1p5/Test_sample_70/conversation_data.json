    "This task requires us to determine the linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark and then find which flags of African nations have the same rank.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the Danish Flag**: First, I will represent the flag of Denmark as a numerical matrix. The problem states to choose values to maximize the rank, so I'll use distinct prime numbers for each color to avoid any accidental linear dependencies.\n2.  **Calculate Denmark's Rank**: I'll determine the rank of the Danish flag's matrix. The rank is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in the matrix.\n3.  **Analyze African Flag Structures**: I will analyze the geometric structures of various African flags to determine their rank.\n    *   **Rank 1**: Simple designs like horizontal or vertical tricolors typically have a rank of 1, as all their rows (or columns) are just multiples of one another.\n    *   **Rank > 2**: Flags with complex patterns, central emblems (like stars or shields), or diagonal elements tend to introduce three or more linearly independent row types, resulting in a rank of 3 or higher.\n    *   **Rank 2**: A rank of 2, like Denmark's, arises from a specific structure that creates exactly two linearly independent row types. This happens, for example, in designs with both vertical and horizontal elements that intersect, such as a cross or a vertical band next to horizontal stripes.\n4.  **Identify and Confirm Matches**: I'll identify African flags that have a geometric structure likely to produce a rank of 2. I'll then create matrices for these flags to confirm their rank.\n5.  **Provide Code and Final Answer**: I will provide a Python script that implements this analysis, calculating the ranks for Denmark and key examples of African flags to demonstrate the principle and arrive at the final answer.\n\nThe following Python script carries out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_flag_rank_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes flag matrices to find African flags with the same rank as Denmark's.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use distinct prime numbers for colors to prevent accidental linear dependencies.\n    # e.g., if red=2, blue=4, a blue stripe would be 2 * a red stripe.
