A finite nilpotent group G is filled if and only if G is not a 2-group of order greater than 2 whose exponent is also greater than 2. Equivalently, the finite filled nilpotent groups are: (1) all finite nilpotent groups whose order is not a power of 2; (2) the trivial group and the cyclic group of order 2; and (3) all elementary abelian 2-groups (groups of order 2^k where every non-identity element has order 2).
