  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nThe problem, despite its narrative, is a mathematical puzzle about information encoding. The computational times and other details are distractors. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1.  **Identify the Information Source:** The Ching contains the encrypted message. It has 9999 unique symbols. This means it can represent at most 9999 different states or values.\n2.  **Identify the Message Alphabet:** The decrypted message is written using a set of 120 unique Chinese characters from the Shu. This is our alphabet size.\n3.  **Formulate the Equation:** We need to find the maximum length of a message, let's call it `L`, that can be written with an alphabet of 120 characters, given that we only have 9999 unique symbols to represent it.\n    *   The number of possible messages of length `L` using an alphabet of 120 characters is `120^L`.\n    *   This number must be less than or equal to the number of available symbols in the Ching.\n    *   This gives us the inequality: `120^L <= 9999`.\n4.  **Solve for L:** To find the maximum integer `L` that satisfies this inequality, we can use logarithms.\n    *   `log(120^L) <= log(9999)`\n    *   `L * log(120) <= log(9999)`\n    *   `L <= log(9999) / log(120)`\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Since `L` must be an integer (as it represents the length of the message), we will calculate the value of the expression and take its floor to find the maximum possible integer length.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform this calculation and explain the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_message_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum possible length of a secret message\n    based on the principles of information encoding.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of unique symbols available for encoding (from the Ching)\n    num_encoding_symbols = 9999\n\n    # Size of the alphabet for the decoded message (from the Shu)\n    message_alphabet_size = 120\n\n    print(\"To find the maximum message length (L), we need to determine the largest integer L for which the number of possible messages does not exceed the number of available encoding symbols.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe formula is: (alphabet_size)^L <= num_encoding_symbols\")\n    print(f\"In our case: {message_alphabet_size}^L <= {num_encoding_symbols}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo solve for L, we can use logarithms:\")\n    print(f\"L * log({message_alphabet_size}) <= log({num_encoding_symbols})\")\n    print(f\"L <= log({num_encoding_symbols}) / log({message_alphabet_size})\")\n\n    # Calculate the upper bound for L\n    # We use math.log (natural logarithm), but any base would work\n    max_l_float = math.log(num_encoding_symbols) / math.log(message_alphabet_size)\n\n    # Since the length of a message must be an integer, we take the floor\n    # of the result to find the maximum valid integer length.\n    max_l_integer = math.floor(max_l_float)\n\n    print(f\"\\nCalculating the value:\")\n    print(f\"L <= {max_l_float:.4f}\")\n    print(\"\\nSince L must be an integer, we take the floor of this value.\")\n    print(f\"Maximum message length = floor({max_l_float:.4f}) = {max_l_integer}\")\n    \n    # Check the result\n    print(f\"\\nVerification:\")\n    power_check_pass = message_alphabet_size ** max_l_integer\n    power_check_fail = message_alphabet_size ** (max_l_integer + 1)\n    print(f\"{message_alphabet_size}^{max_l_integer} = {power_check_pass}, which is <= {num_encoding_symbols} (Correct)\")\n    print(f\"{message_alphabet_size}^{max_l_integer + 1} = {power_check_fail}, which is > {num_encoding_symbols} (Correct)\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_message_length()\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
