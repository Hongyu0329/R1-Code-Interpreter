    print(" - B. Arthritis of the wrist: Gout is a form of arthritis, but this is a general term. The question asks for the specific abnormality causing the nerve symptoms.")
    print(" - C. Pronator syndrome: This is median nerve compression in the forearm, not the hand. The location does not match the findings.")
    print(" - D. Ulnar neuropathy: The ulnar nerve runs through the wrist and hand (in Guyon's canal). It is susceptible to compression from masses like gouty tophi. Compression here directly explains the symptoms of numbness and weakness in the hand.")
    print(" - E. De Quervain tendinosis: This affects tendons on the thumb side of the wrist and causes pain, not widespread numbness and weakness.")
    print("\nStep 4: Conclude the most likely diagnosis.")
    print(" - The most logical conclusion is that the gouty masses in the hands are compressing the ulnar nerve, leading to ulnar neuropathy.")
