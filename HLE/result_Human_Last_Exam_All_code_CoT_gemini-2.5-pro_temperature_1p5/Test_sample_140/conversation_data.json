    "My plan is to solve this problem by simulating a packing strategy called the \"greedy algorithm\". I will calculate the number of blocks that can be placed by repeatedly slicing the cube, packing one section, and then proceeding to pack the remaining space.\n\n1.  **First Slice:** I will take the initial 15x15x15 cube and place the 9x1x1 blocks with their 9-unit length aligned along one of the cube's edges. This completely fills a `9x15x15` volume. I'll calculate how many blocks fit in this volume.\n\n2.  **Second Slice:** This first step leaves a remaining volume of `6x15x15`. The blocks' 9-unit length is too long to fit along the 6-unit edge, so I must align them along one of the 15-unit edges. This fills a `6x9x15` volume within the remaining space. I'll calculate the number of blocks for this section.\n\n3.  **Third Slice:** This leaves a smaller remaining volume of `6x6x15`. Again, I'll align the blocks' 9-unit side with the longest available edge, which is 15 units. This fills a `6x6x9` volume. I will calculate the number of blocks here.\n\n4.  **Final Space:** The last remaining space will be a `6x6x6` cube. A `9x1x1` block cannot fit in this space, as its longest side is greater than any dimension of the remaining cube.\n\n5.  **Total:** The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from the first three steps. I will print the full calculation and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit inside a 15x15x15 cube\n    using a greedy slicing algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    cube_dim = 15\n    block_len = 9\n    block_w = 1\n    block_h = 1\n\n    print(f\"Starting with a cube of size {cube_dim}x{cube_dim}x{cube_dim} and blocks of size {block_len}x{block_w}x{block_h}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Pack the first section\n    print(\"Step 1: Pack a 9x15x15 section of the cube.\")\n    dim1 = block_len\n    dim2 = cube_dim\n    dim3 = cube_dim\n    blocks_step1 = (dim1 // block_len) * (dim2 // block_w) * (dim3 // block_h)\n    print(f\"Number of blocks in this section: ({dim1}/{block_len}) * ({dim2}/{block_w}) * ({dim3}/{block_h}) = {blocks_step1}\")\n    remaining_dim1 = cube_dim - block_len\n    print(f\"Remaining space is a {remaining_dim1}x{cube_dim}x{cube_dim} cuboid.\\n\")\n\n\n    # Step 2: Pack the remaining 6x15x15 space\n    print(\"Step 2: Pack the remaining 6x15x15 section.\")\n    print(\"The 9-unit block length must be aligned with a 15-unit edge.\")\n    # Dimensions of this section are (remaining_dim1, cube_dim, block_len) = (6, 15, 9)\n    dim1 = remaining_dim1\n    dim2 = block_len\n    dim3 = cube_dim\n    blocks_step2 = (dim1 // block_w) * (dim2 // block_len) * (dim3 // block_h)\n    print(f\"Number of blocks in this section: ({dim1}/{block_w}) * ({dim2}/{block_len}) * ({dim3}/{block_h}) = {blocks_step2}\")\n    remaining_dim2 = cube_dim - block_len\n    print(f\"Remaining space is a {remaining_dim1}x{remaining_dim2}x{cube_dim} cuboid.\\n\")\n\n\n    # Step 3: Pack the remaining 6x6x15 space\n    print(\"Step 3: Pack the remaining 6x6x15 section.\")\n    print(\"The 9-unit block length must be aligned with the 15-unit edge.\")\n    # Dimensions of this section are (remaining_dim1, remaining_dim2, block_len) = (6, 6, 9)\n    dim1 = remaining_dim1\n    dim2 = remaining_dim2\n    dim3 = block_len\n    blocks_step3 = (dim1 // block_w) * (dim2 // block_h) * (dim3 // block_len)\n    print(f\"Number of blocks in this section: ({dim1}/{block_w}) * ({dim2}/{block_h}) * ({dim3}/{block_len}) = {blocks_step3}\")\n    remaining_dim3 = cube_dim - block_len\n    print(f\"Remaining space is a {remaining_dim1}x{remaining_dim2}x{remaining_dim3} cuboid.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Final remaining space\n    print(\"Step 4: The final remaining space is 6x6x6.\")\n    blocks_step4 = 0\n    print(\"A 9x1x1 block cannot fit into this space.
