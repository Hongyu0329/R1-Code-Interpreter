    "Here is a step-by-step plan to answer the question:\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This concept refers to the proportion of the total phenotypic variance in a population that can be explained by the additive effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically across the entire genome. It represents the *theoretical upper limit* or ceiling on how much of a trait's variation can be predicted using only SNP data.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability:** A PGS is a tool constructed to predict a phenotype. It is built using the effect sizes of SNPs estimated from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability of this score is typically measured by R², which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain in a separate, independent test sample.\n\n3.  **Compare the Concepts:** The key difference is that SNP heritability is a theoretical maximum based on the *true* effects of all SNPs, while a PGS is a practical model built on *estimated* effects from a finite sample. These estimations always contain some degree of error. Because of this estimation error, plus other factors like imperfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) modeling, a PGS will inevitably be an imperfect predictor. It can only capture a fraction of the total genetic signal that theoretically exists.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the variance explained by a PGS (its R²) must be less than or equal to the total SNP heritability (h²_SNP). It can only approach the SNP heritability as the sample size of the GWAS used to build the score becomes infinitely large, which is not practically achievable. Thus, the predictive ability of a polygenic score is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n```python\ndef explain_pgs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the relationship between SNP heritability and Polygenic Score (PGS) predictive ability.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the total proportion of phenotypic variance\n    # explained by all considered SNPs.
