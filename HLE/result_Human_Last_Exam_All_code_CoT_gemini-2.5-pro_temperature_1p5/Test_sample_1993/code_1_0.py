    # Reasoning
    # The phenotype strongly resembles Turner Syndrome.
    # However, the 46,XX karyotype rules out the classic 45,X cause.
    # A Turner-like phenotype with a normal karyotype points to a structural abnormality
    # of one X chromosome that is not a change in number.
    # The key features (short stature and ovarian dysgenesis) are linked to genes on the
    # short arm of the X chromosome (Xp).
    # Therefore, a deletion in this specific region explains the symptoms.
