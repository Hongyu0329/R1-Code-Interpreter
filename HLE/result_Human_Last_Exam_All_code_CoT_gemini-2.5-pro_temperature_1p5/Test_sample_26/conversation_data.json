    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the topological properties of X.**\n    $X$ is a complex surface (real dimension 4) embedded in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. We use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, which implies that $X$ is simply connected (i.e., $\\pi_1(X) = 0$). This is a crucial starting point.\n\n2.  **Use a formula for the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**.\n    For a simply connected space like $X$, rational homotopy theory provides a powerful formula that relates the rank of its third homotopy group to its homology groups. The formula is:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})) + \\text{rank}(\\ker(\\cup))$\n    where $\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is the cup product map on the second rational cohomology group.\n\n3.  **Compute the Betti numbers of X**.\n    To use the formula, we need the Betti numbers of $X$ ($b_k(X) = \\text{rank}(H_k(X))$).\n    *   $b_0(X) = 1$ since $X$ is connected.\n    *   $b_1(X) = 0$ since $X$ is simply connected.\n    *   For a smooth hypersurface of dimension $n-1$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, its Betti numbers match those of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$ except for the middle one. Here, $X$ is a surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so we compare it to $\\mathbb{CP}^2$. Thus, $b_3(X) = b_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2) = 0$. This implies $\\text{rank}(H_3(X)) = 0$.\n    *   By PoincarÃ© duality, $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$.\n    *   To find $b_2(X)$, we compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. For a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the formula is $\\chi(X) = \\frac{(1-d)^{n+1}-1}{d} + n+1$. For our quintic ($d=5$) in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ ($n=3$), this gives $\\chi(X) = 55$.\n    *   Since $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$, we can solve for $b_2$: $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 \\implies b_2 = 53$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the rank of the kernel of the cup product**.\n    *   The map is $\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n    *   The dimension of the domain is $\\dim(\\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})) = \\binom{b_2}{2} = \\binom{53}{2}$.\n    *   The dimension of the codomain is $\\dim(H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})) = b_4 = 1$.\n    *   The intersection form on $X$ is non-degenerate, so the cup product map is non-trivial and thus surjective (its image has dimension 1).\n    *   By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\text{rank}(\\ker(\\cup)) = \\dim(\\Lambda^2 H^2) - \\dim(\\text{Im}(\\cup)) = \\binom{53}{2} - 1$.\n\n5.  **Assemble the final result**.\n    Combining the pieces, we get $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 0 + \\left(\\binom{53}{2} - 1\\right)$.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a smooth\n    quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters of the problem\n    # n is the dimension of the ambient complex projective space CP^n\n    n = 3\n    # d is the degree of the quintic hypersurface\n    d = 5\n\n    # Step 1: Compute Betti numbers of X.\n    # b_k(X) are the ranks of the homology groups H_k(X).\n    # X is connected.\n    b0 = 1\n    # By Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, X is simply connected, so b1=0.\n    b1 = 0\n    # For a hypersurface in CP^n, b_k matches CP^{n-1} for k != n-1.\n    # Here n=3, dim(X)=2.
