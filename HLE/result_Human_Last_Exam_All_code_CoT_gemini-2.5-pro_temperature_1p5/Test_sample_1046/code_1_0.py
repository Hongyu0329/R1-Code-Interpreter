    Option B is the most comprehensive explanation because it combines both accelerating factors. The process would be:
    
    Step 1: A rare mutation occurs in Bacterium 2.
    
    Step 2: This single mutation happens to provide CROSS-RESISTANCE, making the bacterium resistant to a wide range of drugs simultaneously.
    
    Step 3: COMPENSATORY MUTATIONS follow, eliminating any fitness cost from the initial resistance mutation.
    
    Result: The final strain of Bacterium 2 is not only resistant to multiple drugs but is also highly fit, allowing it to spread through its population as rapidly as a resistance plasmid might spread through the population of Bacterium 1.
