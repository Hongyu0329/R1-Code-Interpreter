# Define the known values from the problem.
dots_cell_8 = 3.0
shape_cell_9 = "Triangle"

# Step 1: Calculate the number of dots for cell 9.
# The pattern is that the dot count of the third cell in a group is either
# double or half of the second cell's dot count, alternating with each group.
# Group 1 (Circle): 4 -> 2 (halved)
# Group 2 (Square): 1.5 -> 3 (doubled)
# Group 3 (Triangle) should be halved again.
dots_cell_9 = dots_cell_8 / 2.0

# Step 2: Calculate the arrow position for cell 9 based on the number of dots.
# The formula is: Radians = Dots * (pi / 3)
position_radians = dots_cell_9 * (math.pi / 3.0)

# Step 3: Convert the position to degrees as it's not divisible by pi/3.
# (pi/2) / (pi/3) = 1.5, which is not an integer.
position_degrees = position_radians * (180.0 / math.pi)

# Step 4: Format the final string, printing the numbers used in the final "equation".
# The format for 1.5 dots is '1½'.
dots_string = "1½"
