As $t \rightarrow \infty$, the edges of the image become progressively smoother and straighter. This process, known as motion by mean curvature, rounds off sharp corners and causes closed convex shapes to shrink and eventually disappear, as the system evolves to minimize the total length of the boundary between black and white regions.
