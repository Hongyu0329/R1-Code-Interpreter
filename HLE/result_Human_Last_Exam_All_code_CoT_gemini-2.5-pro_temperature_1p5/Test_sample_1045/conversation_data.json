    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the basis set (6-31G) for each atom type.**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** As a second-row element, the 6-31G basis set assigns basis functions as follows:\n        *   Core (1s orbital): 1 contracted function.\n        *   Inner Valence (2s, 2p orbitals): 1 s-type function + 3 p-type functions = 4 contracted functions.\n        *   Outer Valence (2s, 2p orbitals): 1 s-type function + 3 p-type functions = 4 contracted functions.\n        *   Total per Carbon atom = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 functions.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** As a first-row element, the 6-31G basis set splits the valence 1s orbital into two parts:\n        *   Inner Valence (1s orbital): 1 contracted function.\n        *   Outer Valence (1s orbital): 1 contracted function.\n        *   Total per Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = 2 functions.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total based on the molecular formula (C7H8).**\n    *   Toluene has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total functions from Carbon = 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63.\n    *   Total functions from Hydrogen = 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16.\n    *   Grand Total = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\nfuncs_per_C = 9  # 1 for core 1s, 4 for inner valence (2s,2p), 4 for outer valence (2s,2p)\nfuncs_per_H = 2  # 1 for inner valence 1s, 1 for outer valence 1s\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from each element\ntotal_C_funcs = num_C * funcs_per_C\ntotal_H_funcs = num_H * funcs_per_H\n\n# Calculate the total for the molecule\ntotal_funcs = total_C_funcs + total_H_funcs\n\nprint(\"To calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for Toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(\"We sum the functions for all atoms.\")\nprint(f\"Total = (Atoms of C * Functions per C) + (Atoms of H * Functions per H)\")\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated numbers\nprint(f\"Calculation: ({num_C} * {funcs_per_C}) + ({num_H} * {funcs_per_H}) = {total_funcs}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is: {total_funcs}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
