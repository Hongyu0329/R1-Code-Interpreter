    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integral is of the form `∫ (f'(x) / f(x)) dx`. This is a standard form whose antiderivative is `ln|f(x)|`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1. This gives `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(0)**:\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Calculate F₃(1)**:\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n5.  **Calculate the Value (V)**: The value of the integral is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`. Since `F₃(x)` is always positive for `x` in `[0, 1]`, we can ignore the absolute value bars. The final expression for `V` is `ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: I will use a Python script to compute the numerical value of `V`, multiply it by 10000, and find the closest integer. The script will also display the intermediate values used in the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the function F3(x) based on the problem description.\ndef F3(x):\n    F0_x = x\n    F1_x = math.sin(F0_x)\n    F2_x = math.exp(F1_x)\n    F3_x = math.log(1 + F2_x)\n    return F3_x\n\n# Step 2: Calculate F3(0) and F3(1).\nF3_0 = F3(0)  # This simplifies to math.log(2)\nF3_1 = F3(1)\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0)).\n# The integral of F3'(x)/F3(x) is ln(F3(x)).\n# By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0)).\nln_F3_0 = math.log(F3_0)\nln_F3_1 = math.log(F3_1)\nV = ln_F3_1 - ln_F3_0\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final result as the closest integer to 10000 * V.\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\n# Step 5: Print the results, including the numbers in the final equation.\nprint(\"--- Step-by-step Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(2) ≈ {F3_0:.6f}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ {F3_1:.6f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe value of the integral is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"V ≈ ln({F3_1:.6f}) - ln({F3_0:.6f})\")\nprint(f\"V ≈ {ln_F3_1:.6f} - ({ln_F3_0:.6f})\")\nprint(f\"V ≈ {V:.6f}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Answer Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"The required value is 10000 * V ≈ 10000 * {V:.6f} ≈ {final_value:.6f}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {closest_integer}\")\n\n<<<5486>>>\n```"
