    "This is a classic wordplay riddle that relies on a phonetic link between Russian and English. The code will walk you through the logic to solve it.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to explain the steps of the deduction:\n1.  Identify the key elements of the riddle: Vienna's boulevards, a Russian description, and an English poet's name.\n2.  Focus on a likely Russian description for Vienna's leafy boulevards.\n3.  Establish the phonetic pun between the Russian descriptive word and an English surname.\n4.  Identify an English poet with that surname to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the logical steps to solve the riddle\n    about the English poet's surname found in a Russian text about Vienna.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The riddle points to the 'wide boulevards of Vienna'. Vienna's boulevards, part of the Ringstrasse, are famous for being lush and green.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: In the Russian language, a very common way to describe something green, like a leafy boulevard, is with the adjective 'зелёный' (zelyonyy).\")\n    \n    description_in_russian = \"зелёный бульвар\"\n    print(f\"   The full phrase for 'green boulevard' would be: '{description_in_russian}'.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: The key to the riddle is a phonetic pun. The Russian word 'зелёный' (zelyonyy) sounds very much like the English surname 'Greene'.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: We need to find an English poet with this surname. Robert Greene (1558–1592) was a prominent English poet and playwright.\")\n\n    final_surname = \"Greene\"\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the surname of the English poet that appears in the description is Greene.\")\n\n# The following lines simulate the final equation by showing the numbered steps that lead to the answer.\nprint(\"Final logical chain:\")\nprint(\"1 (Vienna's Green Boulevards) leads to\")\nprint(\"2 (Russian description 'зелёный') which sounds like\")\nprint(\"3 (The surname of English poet Robert Greene).\")\n\n# Using sys.stdout.write to prevent an extra newline and have the answer appear on a fresh line\n# as if it's the only output, per some platform requirements.\n# sys.stdout.write(final_surname)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Greene>>>"
