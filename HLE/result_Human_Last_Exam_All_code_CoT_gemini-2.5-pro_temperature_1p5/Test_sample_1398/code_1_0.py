    Solves the grid transformation puzzle by discovering the rule from examples
    and applying it to the test grid.

    The discovered rule is a cellular automaton rule:
    The new state of a cell is 1 if the sum of its 8 neighbors is 2 or 3.
    Otherwise, the new state is 0. The original state of the cell itself is ignored.
