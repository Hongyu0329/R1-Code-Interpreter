    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation Rule:** I will examine the provided input and output grid pairs to deduce the underlying transformation rule. I'll focus on how a single cell's value in the output grid relates to its value and the values of its neighbors in the input grid.\n2.  **Hypothesize the Rule:** Based on the analysis, I will form a hypothesis about the rule. It seems to be a type of cellular automaton. I'll test the hypothesis that the new state of any given cell is determined solely by the sum of its eight neighbors. By checking several cells from the examples, I can determine the specific conditions on this sum that result in an output of '1'.\n3.  **Verify the Rule:** I will verify the hypothesized rule by applying it to one or two of the provided example grids to ensure it consistently produces the correct output grid.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to apply the confirmed rule to the sixth test input grid.\n    *   The script will represent the grid as a 2D array.\n    *   It will iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n    *   For each cell, it will calculate the sum of its eight neighbors, handling the grid boundaries correctly (assuming cells outside the grid are 0).\n    *   It will determine the new cell value based on the discovered rule.\n    *   To meet the requirements, the script will print the step-by-step calculation for each cell, showing the neighbor sum and the resulting output value.\n5.  **Generate Final Output:** Finally, the script will print the complete output grid and then flatten it into the requested 25-character binary string format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the transformation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_grid_transformation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the grid transformation puzzle by discovering the rule from examples\n    and applying it to the test grid.\n\n    The discovered rule is a cellular automaton rule:\n    The new state of a cell is 1 if the sum of its 8 neighbors is 2 or 3.\n    Otherwise, the new state is 0.
