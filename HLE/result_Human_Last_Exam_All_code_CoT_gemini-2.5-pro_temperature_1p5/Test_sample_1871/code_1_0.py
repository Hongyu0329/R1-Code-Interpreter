# The problem asks for the partial derivative of the signed distance function rho
# with respect to its first argument, evaluated at a point (alpha, beta).
# Let R be the desired quantity, D_x rho(alpha, beta).
# Let X be an auxiliary variable, D_x x_c(alpha, beta), where x_c is the
# x-coordinate of the nearest point on the curve y=x^5 to (alpha, beta).

# As derived from the problem's conditions, R and X must satisfy a system
# of two linear equations. The point (alpha, beta) is located such that
# the closest point on the curve is (1, 1), leading to the following system
# evaluated at x_c = 1:
#
# Equation 1: R = X - 1
# Equation 2: R = -5 * X
#
# We will now solve this system for R.
