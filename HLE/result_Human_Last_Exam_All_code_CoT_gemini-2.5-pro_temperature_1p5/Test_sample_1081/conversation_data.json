    "My plan to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for a group of type $E_8$ is as follows:\n\n1.  First, I will state the general mathematical formula for counting the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori (up to conjugacy) in a reductive group $G$. This number is determined by the structure of the group's Weyl group, $W$, and the action of the Frobenius endomorphism, $F$. Specifically, it is the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in $W$.\n2.  Next, I will apply this formula to the specific case of a group of type $E_8$. A key property of $E_8$ is that its Dynkin diagram has no symmetries. This implies that any group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is of the \"split\" form. For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group.\n3.  This trivial action greatly simplifies the formula: the number of $F$-conjugacy classes becomes equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n4.  Finally, the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a well-known result in mathematics. I will provide a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final constant, which is the answer to the problem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_e8_tori_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n    in a reductive group of type E_8 over the finite field F_q.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Introduction to the problem\n    print(\"This program determines the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a reductive group G of type E_8.\")\n    print(\"The number of such tori, up to conjugacy by elements of G(F_q), is given by a specific formula from algebraic group theory.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: The general formula\n    print(\"Step 1: State the general formula.\")\n    print(\"The number of G(F_q)-conjugacy classes of maximal tori defined over F_q is equal to the number of F-conjugacy classes in the group's Weyl group W.\")\n    print(\"An F-conjugacy class is an equivalence class for the relation w1 ~ w2 if w1 = g * w2 * F(g)^-1 for some g in W, where F is the Frobenius endomorphism.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2: Specialize to the case of E_8\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the formula to a group of type E_8.\")\n    print(\"A group of type E_8 is always 'split' over any field F_q.
