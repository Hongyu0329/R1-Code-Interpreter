# The solutions to the three parts of the puzzle based on literary analysis and the mathematical constraint.
# (A) The story is "The Priory School". The fake shoes were in the shape of cow hooves, thus "belonging" to the imitated creature.
num_A = 6
# (B) Kinbote, an academic, uses scholarly tools to mislead the reader about the poem's meaning.
num_B = 3
# (C) Nabokov's most extensive work of "back-referencing" is his massive commentary on Pushkin's novel.
num_C = 7

# Print the three numbers in the specified format
print(f"{num_A} {num_B} {num_C}")

# As requested, output the final equation showing that the sum is a multiple of 8
total = num_A + num_B + num_C
print(f"The equation is: {num_A} + {num_B} + {num_C} = {total}")
