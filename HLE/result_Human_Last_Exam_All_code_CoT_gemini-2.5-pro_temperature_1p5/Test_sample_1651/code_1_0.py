# The user wants to find the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points
# of the Stone-Cech lift of a continuous function f: R -> R in the remainder.

# PLAN:
# 1. This is a problem in advanced topology, not a typical coding problem.
#    The Stone-Cech compactification and its remainder are abstract mathematical spaces.
#    We cannot represent them directly in code.
# 2. The solution relies on finding a specific continuous function `f` for which
#    the number of fixed points in the remainder is minimized and non-zero.
# 3. We will reason about the properties of the extension of `f` to find this number.
# 4. A key idea is to analyze how `f` behaves at infinity, as this determines
#    the mapping of points in the remainder. The points in the remainder can be
#    thought of as "points at infinity".
# 5. We will argue that the function f(x) = x^2 results in exactly one
#    fixed point in the remainder.
#    - For any sequence (x_n) such that |x_n| -> infinity (which corresponds to
#      any point in the remainder), the sequence f(x_n) = (x_n)^2 always tends to
#      +infinity.
#    - This means the extension `F` maps *every* point `p` in the remainder `R*`
#      to the single point `p_+infinity` (the point at positive infinity).
#    - A fixed point `p` must satisfy F(p) = p.
#    - Substituting F(p) = p_+infinity, we get p = p_+infinity.
#    - Thus, there is only one fixed point in the remainder: `p_+infinity`.
# 6. The number of fixed points is 1. Since the question asks for the smallest
#    *non-zero* number, and we have found a case with 1 fixed point, this must be
#    the minimum.

# Let's define the final equation based on our reasoning.
# Let N be the number of fixed points of F in the remainder R*.
# We are looking for the minimum of N over all continuous functions f, such that N > 0.
# min { N | N > 0 } = ?
# Our analysis with f(x) = x^2 shows that N can be 1.
# Since 1 is the smallest positive integer, this is the minimum non-zero value.

smallest_nonzero_fixed_points = 1

# Final equation: Smallest_nonzero_number_of_fixed_points = 1
print("The smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points is given by the equation:")
print(f"Smallest_nonzero_number_of_fixed_points = {smallest_nonzero_fixed_points}")
