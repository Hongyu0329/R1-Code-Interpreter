    "My plan is to identify the most likely answer to this mycology trivia question. While a true blue spore print is not scientifically documented, the question points towards a specific genus known for its distinct blue characteristics, which often leads to this common misconception. I will write a Python script that stores this genus name in a variable and then prints it as the answer, along with a brief explanation for clarity.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mycology_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the mushroom genus most famously associated with the color blue,\n    which is the common answer to the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The question implies there is one specific genus with a blue spore print.\n    # In mycology, this is a point of confusion. No known genus produces a\n    # truly blue spore print.\n    # However, the genus Lactarius, and specifically the species Lactarius indigo,\n    # is famous for its vibrant blue latex (milk) when cut.
