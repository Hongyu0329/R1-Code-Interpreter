    "Of course. Let's explore the equilibrium in a quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Classical Prisoner's Dilemma**: Briefly state the classical problem and its suboptimal equilibrium (`Defect, Defect`).\n2.  **Quantum Game Setup**: I will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a standard model for quantizing this game.\n    *   The game starts with a shared maximally entangled state created by an operator `J`.\n    *   Players' strategies are no longer just \"Cooperate\" (C) or \"Defect\" (D), but any unitary transformation on their respective qubits. We will focus on three key strategies: the classical `C` and `D`, and a new quantum strategy `Q`.\n3.  **The Equilibrium Point**: In the quantum version, a new Nash Equilibrium emerges: `(Q, Q)`. At this equilibrium, both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`. This outcome is Pareto optimal, meaning it's better for both players than the classical `(D, D)` outcome and neither can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy. The payoff matches the ideal, but unstable, `(C, C)` outcome.\n4.  **Python Implementation**: I will write a Python script using `numpy` to model the quantum game. The code will:\n    *   Define the payoff matrix and the necessary quantum operators (`J`, `C`, `D`, `Q`).\n    *   Calculate the final state of the game when both players choose the `Q` strategy.\n    *   Determine the probabilities of the classical outcomes (`CC`, `CD`, `DC`, `DD`).\n    *   Calculate the final payoff for both players at the `(Q, Q)` equilibrium.\n    *   Print the final payoff equation.\n\nThe core idea is that the initial entanglement allows players' choices to be correlated in a way that is not possible in the classical world, enabling them to achieve the cooperative outcome as a stable equilibrium.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the payoff at the quantum equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef quantum_prisoners_dilemma_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the payoff for the quantum equilibrium point\n    in the Prisoner's Dilemma using the EWL protocol.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
