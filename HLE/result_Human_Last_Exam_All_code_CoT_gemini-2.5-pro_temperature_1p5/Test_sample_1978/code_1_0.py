# This is determined by the size of the matrix A, which is 202000x202000.
n = 202000

# Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions, l.
# We can represent the given conditions in a matrix form, where rows are conditions
# and columns correspond to the variables x_i(0) and x_i(T).
# The relevant variables are x_1, x_2, and x_2024.
# Let the columns be [x_1(0), x_2(0), x_2024(0), x_1(T), x_2(T), x_2024(T)]
# We construct the coefficient matrix for the 6 given conditions.

# Condition 1: -x_1(0) + x_1(T) = 0
# Condition 2: -x_2(0) + x_2(T) = 0
# Condition 3: -5*x_2(0) + 5*x_2(T) = 0
# Condition 4: -100*x_2(0) + 100*x_2(T) = 0
# Condition 5: 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0
# Condition 6: -100*x_2024(0) + 100*x_2024(T) = 0
