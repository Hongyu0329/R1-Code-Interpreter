    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the order of the system (n):** The order of the system of differential equations is determined by the dimension of the vector `x(t)`. The matrix `A` is given as a `202000 x 202000` matrix, which implies that the system consists of 202000 equations. Therefore, `n = 202000`.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (l):** The problem provides a list of six boundary conditions. We need to check for redundancy and find the number of unique, linearly independent conditions.\n    *   `x₁(T) - x₁(0) = 0`\n    *   `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`\n    *   `5x₂(T) - 5x₂(0) = 0`, which simplifies to `5 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`. This is linearly dependent on the second condition.\n    *   `100x₂(T) - 100x₂(0) = 0`, which is `100 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`. Also linearly dependent on the second condition.\n    *   `1000x₂(0) - 1000x₂(T) = 0`, which is `-1000 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`. Also linearly dependent on the second condition.\n    *   `100x₂₀₂₄(T) - 100x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`, which simplifies to `x₂₀₂₄(T) - x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`. This condition is on a different component (`x₂₀₂₄`) and is linearly independent of the others.\n\n    Counting the unique, independent conditions, we have one for `x₁`, one for `x₂`, and one for `x₂₀₂₄`. Thus, there are `l = 3` linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the index:** The index of a linear boundary-value problem is defined as `index = n - l`, where `n` is the order of the system and `l` is the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\nWe can use a Python script to formally determine `l` by calculating the rank of the coefficient matrix of the boundary conditions and then compute the index.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the dimension of the system, n.\n# This is determined by the size of the matrix A, which is 202000x202000.\nn = 202000\n\n# Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions, l.\n# We can represent the given conditions in a matrix form, where rows are conditions\n# and columns correspond to the variables x_i(0) and x_i(T).\n# The relevant variables are x_1, x_2, and x_2024.\n# Let the columns be [x_1(0), x_2(0), x_2024(0), x_1(T), x_2(T), x_2024(T)]\n# We construct the coefficient matrix for the 6 given conditions.\n\n# Condition 1: -x_1(0) + x_1(T) = 0\n# Condition 2: -x_2(0) + x_2(T) = 0\n# Condition 3: -5*x_2(0) + 5*x_2(T) = 0\n# Condition 4: -100*x_2(0) + 100*x_2(T) = 0\n# Condition 5: 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0\n# Condition 6: -100*x_2024(0) + 100*x_2024(T) = 0\n\nboundary_conditions_matrix = np.array([\n    [-1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, -5, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n    [0, -100, 0, 0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 1000, 0, 0, -1000, 0],\n    [0, 0, -100, 0, 0, 100]\n])\n\n# The number of linearly independent boundary conditions is the rank of this matrix.\nl = np.linalg.matrix_rank(boundary_conditions_matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem.\n# The index is defined as n - l.\nindex = n - l\n\n# Output the final calculation.\nprint(f\"The dimension of the system is n = {n}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of linearly independent boundary conditions is l = {l}.\")\nprint(\"The index of the problem is calculated as n - l.\")\nprint(f\"Index = {n} - {l} = {index}\")\n\n```\n<<<201997>>>"
