    This function identifies the correct statements about language model inference.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    - A) Correct. Combining top-k and nucleus sampling results in a pool that is the intersection of the two, which is the more restrictive set.
    - B) Incorrect. b=1 beam search is identical to greedy search, regardless of ties.
    - C) Correct. Temperature > 1 flattens the distribution, requiring more tokens to meet the cumulative probability p, potentially including new ones.
    - E) Correct. Renormalizing probabilities (p_i / sum(p_kept)) preserves the ratios (p_i/p_j) for all kept tokens.
    - F) Incorrect. The mass excluded by nucleus sampling can be larger than that excluded by top-k.
    - G) Correct. The final pool is an intersection of two sets, and intersection is commutative.
    - H) Incorrect. Beam search explores more hypotheses than greedy search (which has one), thus offering more diversity.
    - I) Incorrect. Temperature < 1 sharpens the distribution, making it *more* likely that beams converge, not less.
    - J) Incorrect. Length normalization is a heuristic that mitigates but does not "completely eliminate" the beam curse.
    - K) Incorrect. Repetition penalties are equivalent to *increasing* temperature for specific tokens, not lowering it.
    - L) Incorrect. Nucleus sampling with p=1 considers the entire vocabulary, which is always equivalent to standard multinomial sampling.
    - M) Correct. With fixed seeds and deterministic algorithms, all computations, including MoE routing, can be made deterministic.
    - O) Correct. Different GPU architectures have different floating-point arithmetic hardware, which can cause results to diverge.
    - P) Correct. Non-deterministic expert pruning changes the computational graph, altering the final probabilities and thus the nucleus sample set.
    - Q) Incorrect. Non-determinism can arise from sources other than routing and attention (e.g., FFN layers), so the condition is not sufficient.
    - R) Correct. Variable sequence lengths and padding can alter GPU kernel dispatch and floating-point behavior, causing non-determinism.
    - S) Incorrect. The entropy of a mixture of distributions can be greater than the entropy of any individual component.
    - T) Incorrect. Quantization can alter the relative ranking of tokens with close probabilities.
    - W) Incorrect. If all experts produce the same distribution, the mixture is unchanged, so the "effective temperature" is not "always" higher.
    - X) Correct. The order of summation in attention is non-deterministic on parallel hardware, leading to numerical differences.
    - Y) Correct. Recomputing activations during checkpointing is not guaranteed to be bit-identical to the original computation due to floating-point effects.
