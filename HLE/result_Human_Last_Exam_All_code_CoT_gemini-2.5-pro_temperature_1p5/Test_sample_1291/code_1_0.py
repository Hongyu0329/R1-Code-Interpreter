        "### Step 1: Understanding the Berkovich Projective Line over C_p",
        "The Berkovich projective line, P^{1, an}, over a complete non-Archimedean field is a space of seminorms.",
        "Its points are classified into four types. However, the field in question is C_p, the completion of the algebraic closure of Q_p.",
        "C_p is not only algebraically closed but also spherically complete. A key consequence of spherical completeness is that there are no nested sequences of disks with an empty intersection.",
        "This means that for the Berkovich projective line over C_p, there are only three types of points:",
        "  - Type 1: Classical points, which correspond to the points of P^1(C_p). These can be thought of as disks D(a, r) with radius r = 0.",
        "  - Type 2: Disks D(a, r) with center a in C_p and radius r belonging to the value group of the base field, p^Q. These are disks with 'rational' radii.",
        "  - Type 3: Disks D(a, r) with center a in C_p and radius r > 0 that is not in p^Q. These are disks with 'irrational' radii.",
        "  - Type 4 points do not exist over C_p.",
        
        "\n### Step 2: Mapping from C_p^x * C_p to Berkovich Points",
        "The problem defines a subset of P^{1, an} as the quotient of C_p^x * C_p by an equivalence relation.",
        "A natural way to map a point (z_0, z) from C_p^x * C_p to a geometric object in the Berkovich space is to associate it with a disk.",
        "The pair (z_0, z) can define an affine map x -> z_0*x + z. In this context, it's standard to associate (z_0, z) with a disk D(a, r) where:",
        "  - The center is a = z / z_0",
        "  - The radius is r = 1 / |z_0|_p",
        "The equivalence relation is designed to make this association well-defined, so that each equivalence class corresponds to a single point in the Berkovich line.",

        "\n### Step 3: Characterizing the Set of Disks",
        "We need to determine what kinds of disks D(a, r) are produced by our mapping:",
        "  - Center 'a': Since z can be any element in C_p and z_0 can be any non-zero element in C_p, their ratio a = z / z_0 can be any element in C_p.",
        "  - Radius 'r': The p-adic norm |.|_p on C_p can take any non-negative real value. Since z_0 is in C_p^x, |z_0|_p can be any positive real number. Consequently, the radius r = 1 / |z_0|_p can also be any positive real number (r > 0).",

        "\n### Step 4: Classifying the Included Points",
        "The set of points included in the subset is the set of all disks D(a, r) with a in C_p and r in R_{>0}. Let's classify them:",
        "  - Can we get Type 1 points? No. Type 1 points correspond to r = 0. Our radius r = 1 / |z_0|_p is always strictly positive because z_0 is non-zero.",
        "  - Can we get Type 2 points? Yes. These correspond to disks with radius r in p^Q_{>0}. Since r can be any positive real number, we can certainly choose z_0 such that r = 1 / |z_0|_p is in this set.",
        "  - Can we get Type 3 points? Yes. These correspond to disks with radius r > 0 that is not in p^Q. Since r can be any positive real number, we can choose z_0 to produce such a radius.",
        "  - Can we get Type 4 points? No. As established in Step 1, they do not exist over C_p.",

        "\n### Step 5: Conclusion",
        "The subset of the Berkovich projective line isomorphic to the given quotient space consists of all disks with a center in C_p and any positive radius.",
        "This collection precisely corresponds to all points of Type 2 and Type 3.",
