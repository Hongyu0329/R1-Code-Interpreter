    "In this problem, we will calculate the symmetry factors for all connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory. A symmetry factor, denoted by $S$, is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting when enumerating Feynman diagrams. The final contribution of a diagram to an amplitude is inversely proportional to its symmetry factor. We will calculate the symmetry factor for each distinct diagram topology and then sum these factors.\n\nThere are two such diagrams:\n1.  **The \"Sunset\" Diagram:** This diagram consists of two vertices connected by four propagators.\n2.  **The \"Figure-8\" Diagram:** This diagram has two vertices. At each vertex, two lines form a loop, and the other two lines connect to the other vertex, forming two propagators between them.\n\nMy plan to calculate the symmetry factor for each diagram is as follows:\n1.  Identify all possible permutations of the diagram's components (vertices and propagators) that leave the diagram's topology unchanged.\n2.  The symmetry factor is the total number of such permutations (the order of the diagram's automorphism group).\n3.  Calculate the symmetry factor for the Sunset diagram.\n4.  Calculate the symmetry factor for the Figure-8 diagram.\n5.  Sum the resulting symmetry factors.\n\nThe code will perform these calculations and print out each step, showing how each factor is derived, and then present the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for the two connected second-order\n    vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 scalar field theory and sums them.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Calculating symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubbles in phi^4 theory.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: The \"Sunset\" Diagram ---\n    # This diagram has two vertices and four propagators connecting them.\n    # The symmetry factor S is the product of:\n    # 1.
