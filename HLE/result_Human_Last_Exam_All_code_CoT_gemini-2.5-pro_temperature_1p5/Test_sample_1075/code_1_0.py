    # 1. Define the core facts of the case.
    buyer = "Lewis"
    seller = "Marcel"
    contract_subject_description = "A very detailed and large landscape painting of Algonquin Park or Hudson Bay during Autumn."
    stated_purpose = "To hang as the centrepiece of their living room."
    item_delivered = "A very small, hastily painted picture that clearly resembled a nearby creek."
    price_paid = 5000

    # 2. Analyze the legal issues based on the Sale of Goods Act (SGA).

    # Issue A: Does the SGA apply?
    # The contract is for a tangible item (a painting), making it a contract for the sale of goods.
    # The service (painting) is incidental to producing the good. So, the SGA applies.
    # This eliminates options A and B which claim it's a services contract.
    analysis_sga_applies = True

    # Issue B: Was there a breach of an implied condition?
    # The SGA has an implied condition of "fitness for purpose". This applies if:
    #   i) The buyer communicates the purpose (Lewis did: "centrepiece").
    #  ii) The buyer relies on the seller's skill (Lewis did: Marcel is a "highly regarded artist").
    # The small, hasty painting of a different location is not fit for the purpose of being a "centrepiece".
    #
    # The SGA also has an implied condition that goods match their description.
    # The painting delivered did not match the description: "Algonquin Park or Hudson Bay", "large", "detailed".
    analysis_breach_of_condition = True

    # Issue C: Does the contract need to explicitly mention the SGA?
    # No. The point of the SGA is that its conditions are *implied* by law into contracts for the sale of goods,
    # unless expressly excluded. They do not need to be mentioned to be included.
    # This eliminates option E.
    analysis_explicit_mention_needed = False

    # Issue D: Was the breach insignificant?
    # No. The difference between what was ordered and what was delivered is substantial.
    # A painting of a local creek is not a substitute for a large painting of Algonquin Park.
    # This eliminates option C.
    analysis_breach_is_significant = True

    # 3. Conclusion based on the analysis.
    # Lewis's understanding is correct. The SGA applies, and there has been a breach of a major condition
    # (both fitness for purpose and correspondence with description).
    # A breach of condition allows the buyer to repudiate the contract and demand a full refund.
    # Therefore, Option D is the correct legal advice.
    correct_option = "D"
    explanation = f"The lawyer will inform Lewis that his interpretation of the SGA is correct and that he will be able to require Marcel to return the amount that Lewis paid for the painting because the painting delivered by Marcel breached the implied condition of fitness for purpose found in the SGA."
