    # 2. The Local Search Phase
    # The algorithm starts with a random proof and iteratively tries to improve it by
    # flipping one bit at a time. It decides which bit to flip based on whether
    # the flip reduces the verifier's rejection probability, p_rej.
    # A potential problem is that this search could get stuck in a "local minimum".
    #
    # However, let's analyze when a step is guaranteed to succeed.
    # Suppose we are at proof 'pi' with distance d = delta(pi, Pi(x)).
    # There exists a neighbor 'pi_prime' (one bit flip away) with distance
    # d_prime <= d - 1/m.
    #
    # We can detect this improvement if p_rej(pi_prime) is guaranteed to be less than p_rej(pi).
    # This requires that the upper bound for p_rej(pi_prime) is less than the lower bound for p_rej(pi):
    #   C * d_prime < c * d
    #   C * (d - 1/m) < c * d
    #   C*d - C/m < c*d
    #   (C - c) * d < C/m
    #   d < (C / (C - c)) / m
    #
    # This inequality shows that local search might fail to find an improvement if the
    # current proof is already very close to a correct one. Let K = C / (C-c).
    # The search is guaranteed to work as long as d*m > K.
    # This means the local search phase can efficiently find a proof 'pi' that is
    # at a Hamming distance of at most K from a correct proof.
