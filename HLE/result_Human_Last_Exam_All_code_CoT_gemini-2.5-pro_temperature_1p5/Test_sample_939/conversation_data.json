    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If the resulting sRGB values for any channel (R, G, or B) fall outside the valid range, the color cannot be represented. The valid range for sRGB values, before being encoded into 8-bit integers (0-255), is [0.0, 1.0].\n\nHere is the plan for the Python script:\n1.  **Define Conversion Matrices:** We will use standard color science matrices to perform the conversion. The process involves converting from ROMM RGB to the standard CIE XYZ color space, applying a chromatic adaptation transform to change the white point from D50 (for ROMM) to D65 (for sRGB), and finally converting from CIE XYZ to sRGB. These will be combined into a single matrix.\n2.  **Linearize ROMM values:** The input ROMM RGB values are non-linear. They must first be converted to linear values by raising them to the power of their gamma, which is 1.8.\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** The linearized ROMM RGB vector is multiplied by the combined conversion matrix to obtain the linear sRGB values.\n4.  **Check Gamut:** For each color, we'll check if any of the resulting linear sRGB values are less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0. If they are, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n5.  **Output Results:** The script will process each color, print the calculated sRGB values, and state whether it can be represented. Finally, it will list the numbers of all colors that are out of gamut.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# A color is unrepresentable in sRGB if, after conversion, any of its R, G, B\n# components are outside the range [0.0, 1.0]. This script performs the standard\n# conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB and checks this condition for each color.\n\n# 1.
