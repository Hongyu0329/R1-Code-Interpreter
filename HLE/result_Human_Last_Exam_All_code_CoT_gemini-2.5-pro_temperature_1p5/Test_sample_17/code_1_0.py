    print("Let the regular super-differential partial^+_hat J(mu_bar) be non-empty.")

    print("\nStep 4: Combine the inequalities.")
    print("For any given path with tangent v, we can combine the two inequalities:")
    print("  J(mu_bar) + <xi, v> + o(W_2) <= J(mu_t) <= J(mu_bar) + <zeta, v> + o(W_2)")

    print("\nSubtracting and rearranging gives:")
    print("  <zeta - xi, v> + o(W_2) >= 0")

    print("\nStep 5: Generalize over the tangent space.")
    print("The previous inequality must hold for ANY tangent vector v in the tangent space at mu_bar.")
    print("Let's consider the tangent vector -v. Substituting this into the inequality gives:")

    zeta_minus_xi = "zeta - xi"

    print("\nStep 7: Final Conclusion.")
    print("We have shown that if a regular super-gradient (zeta) and a sub-gradient (xi) both exist, they must be equal.")
    print("This means the intersection of the sub-differential and super-differential, partial J(mu_bar) AND partial^+ J(mu_bar), contains the unique element xi=zeta.")
    print("This is the definition of J being differentiable at mu_bar.")
