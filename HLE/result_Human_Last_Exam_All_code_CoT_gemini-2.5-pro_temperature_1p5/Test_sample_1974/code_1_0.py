    print("The set of all such polynomials can be effectively enumerated and put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (a process known as Gödel numbering).")
    print("Therefore, the set of all Diophantine equations is countably infinite, with cardinality Aleph_0.")

    print("This statement psi is known to be consistent with ZFC (if ZFC is) but unprovable in ZFC.")
    print("The existence of a model for a theory implies its consistency. If psi is true, an omega-model for ZFC exists.")
    print("This model is also a model for T_1, T_2, and so on for all standard natural numbers n.")
    print("Therefore, ZFC + psi proves Con(T_n) for all n, which means it proves the unsolvability of D_n for all n.")


    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion")
    print("We have constructed a scenario where the set S contains the countably infinite set {D_0, D_1, D_2, ...}.")
    print("This means the cardinality of S can be at least Aleph_0.")
    print("Combining this with the result from Step 1 (|S| <= Aleph_0), we conclude that the maximum possible cardinality is Aleph_0.")
