    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the expression, followed by the Python code to present the result.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** The problem is set within the context of Quantum Field Theory, specifically the `ϕ^4` theory, which is a model used to study critical phenomena and particle interactions. We are interested in the behavior of this theory near four spacetime dimensions.\n2.  **Use the Renormalization Group (RG):** The concept of a \"fixed point coupling\" comes from the Renormalization Group. The RG describes how the coupling constants of a theory change as we change the energy scale at which we observe the system. A fixed point is a value of the coupling that does not change under this transformation.\n3.  **Find the Beta Function:** The change in the coupling constant `u` with the energy scale `μ` is described by the beta function, `β(u) = μ * du/dμ`. To find the leading order expression, we need to calculate the beta function to the one-loop level in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, where `ϵ` is a small parameter.\n4.  **Calculate the one-loop Beta Function:** The standard one-loop calculation for a single-component `ϕ^4` theory yields the beta function:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + 3u² / (16π²)`.\n    *   The first term, `-ϵu`, arises from the fact that the coupling `u` has a mass dimension of `ϵ` in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions.\n    *   The second term, `3u² / (16π²)`, is the quantum correction calculated from one-loop Feynman diagrams. The factor of 3 comes from the three possible ways (s, t, and u channels) to connect four external lines in a loop.\n5.  **Solve for the Fixed Point:** A fixed point `u*` is a solution to the equation `β(u*) = 0`.\n    `-ϵu* + 3(u*)² / (16π²) = 0`\n6.  **Find the Non-trivial Solution:** This equation has two solutions. One is `u* = 0`, the trivial \"Gaussian\" fixed point corresponding to a free, non-interacting theory. The other, non-trivial solution (known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point) is found by solving:\n    `ϵ = 3u* / (16π²)`.\n    Rearranging for `u*` gives the desired leading-order expression.\n7.  **Generate Python Code:** The Python code will programmatically construct and print this final expression, clearly showing each numerical component as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the leading order expression for the \n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final expression for u* is derived from the one-loop beta function\n    # β(u) = -ϵu + 3u² / (16π²).\n    # Setting β(u*) = 0 for the non-trivial fixed point gives u* = (16π² / 3) * ϵ.\n\n    # Components of the expression\n    numerator_constant = 16\n    denominator_constant = 3\n    pi_symbol = \"π\"\n    pi_exponent = 2\n    epsilon_symbol = \"ϵ\"\n\n    print(\"The fixed point coupling u* is found by solving β(u*) = 0.\")\n    print(\"For ϕ⁴ theory in d=4-ϵ dimensions, the one-loop beta function is:\")\n    print(f\"β(u) = -{epsilon_symbol}u + ({denominator_constant}u²) / ({numerator_constant}{pi_symbol}²)\\n\")\n    print(\"Solving for the non-trivial fixed point u* yields the following expression:\")\n    \n    # Final equation is constructed from the individual numbers and symbols\n    # to fulfill the requirement of outputting each number.\n    print(f\"u* = ( {numerator_constant} * {pi_symbol}^{pi_exponent} / {denominator_constant} ) * {epsilon_symbol}\")\n\nsolve_fixed_point_coupling()\n<<<u* = (16 * π**2 / 3) * ϵ>>>"
