    Determines the necessary AI capabilities for replicating the Visual Cliff and Swinging Room experiments.

    The function breaks down the requirements for each experiment and evaluates each listed capability.
    I.   Goal-driven locomotion: Needed to test the choice to cross the cliff.
    II.  MST analogue (optic flow): Needed for motion parallax (cliff) and is the core of the room illusion.
    III. Relative size evaluation: Needed for the texture gradient cue on the cliff.
    IV.  Binocular disparity: A primary depth cue for the cliff.
    V.   Posture control: The core mechanism being tested and measured in the swinging room.
