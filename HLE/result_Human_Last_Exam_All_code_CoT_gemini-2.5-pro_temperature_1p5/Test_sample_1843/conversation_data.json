    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order, we can follow a systematic approach based on number theory.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Decomposition by Prime Factors**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$, and $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is the prime factorization of $N$. The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters $\\chi_i$.\n\n2.  **Prime Factorization**: We start by finding the prime factorization of the conductor $N = 36036$. This will break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts for each prime power factor.\n\n3.  **Count Primitive Characters by Order**: For each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we need to determine the number of primitive characters that exist for each possible order. This depends on the structure of the group of characters modulo $p^a$.\n    *   For $p=2, a=2$ (i.e., conductor 4), there is one primitive character, which has order 2.\n    *   For a prime $p>2$ and $a=1$, all non-trivial characters are primitive. The number of characters of order $k$ (where $k | p-1$ and $k>1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n    *   For a prime $p>2$ and $a \\ge 2$, the primitive characters are those whose order $k$ divides $\\phi(p^a)$ but does not divide $\\phi(p^{a-1})$. For each such $k$, there are $\\phi(k)$ characters.\n\n4.  **Combinatorial Counting with Mobius Inversion**: We need to count the number of combinations of these component characters such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6. A robust method for this is using the Mobius inversion formula, which is a generalization of the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The number of characters of order exactly $K$ is:\n    $$ \\text{Count} = \\sum_{d|K} \\mu\\left(\\frac{K}{d}\\right) N(d) $$\n    Here, $N(d)$ is the total number of primitive characters whose order divides $d$. $N(d)$ is calculated by multiplying the counts of characters from each prime power factor whose order divides $d$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We will compute $N(d)$ for all divisors $d$ of our target order $K=6$. Then, we will apply the Mobius inversion formula to get the final count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will calculate the result step-by-step and print the details of the calculation, including the final equation derived from the Mobius inversion formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = defaultdict(int)\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] += 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] += 1\n    return dict(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\nmemo_phi = {}\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n in memo_phi:\n        return memo_phi[n]\n    if n == 1:\n        memo_phi[1] = 1\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    memo_phi[n] = result\n    return result\n\nmemo_mobius = {}\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n in memo_mobius:\n        return memo_mobius[n]\n    if n == 1:\n        memo_mobius[1] = 1\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            memo_mobius[n] = 0\n            return 0\n    result = (-1)**len(factors)\n    memo_mobius[n] = result\n    return result\n\ndef count_primitive_orders(p, a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo p^a by their order.\n    Returns a dictionary {order: count}.\n    \"\"\"\n    if p == 2:\n        if a == 1: return {}\n        if a == 2: return {2: 1}\n        # For a >= 3, all 2^(a-2) primitive characters have order 2^(a-2).\n        return {2**(a - 2): 2**(a - 2)}\n    \n    # p is an odd prime\n    if a == 1:\n        m = p - 1\n        orders = {}\n        divs = get_divisors(m)\n        for k in divs:\n            if k > 1:\n                orders[k] = phi(k)\n        return orders\n    else: # a >= 2\n        m = phi(p**a)\n        m_non_primitive = phi(p**(a - 1))\n        \n        orders = {}\n        divs_m = get_divisors(m)\n        for k in divs_m:\n            if k > 0 and m_non_primitive % k != 0:\n                orders[k] = phi(k)\n        return orders\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters\n    of conductor N and order K.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    K = 6\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order K = {K}.\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of N\n    factors_N = get_prime_factorization(N)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: The prime factorization of N is {N} = {' * '.join([f'{p}^{a}' for p, a in factors_N.items()])}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Get orders for primitive characters for each factor\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: For each prime power factor p^a, we count the primitive characters by their order.\")\n    char_orders_by_factor = {}\n    for p, a in sorted(factors_N.items()):\n        pa_val = p**a\n        char_orders_by_factor[pa_val] = count_primitive_orders(p, a)\n        print(f\"  - For conductor {pa_val}: {char_orders_by_factor[pa_val]}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Use Mobius inversion.
