# The problem is designed to simplify algebraically, making the large value of p irrelevant
# other than to satisfy certain properties (e.g., being a large prime).
# The final result of the expression f(p) is 2^81.
# The calculation steps are outlined in the thought process.

# The final simplified equation is f(p) = 2^81.
# Here we calculate the value of 2^81.

base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result
result = base ** exponent

# As per the instructions, print the numbers in the final equation.
# The final equation is essentially result = base ^ exponent
print(f"{base}^{exponent} = {result}")
