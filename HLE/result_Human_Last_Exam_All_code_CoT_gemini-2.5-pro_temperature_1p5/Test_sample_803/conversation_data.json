    "To determine the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and a natural number $m$, we will follow a plan based on established group theory results.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the structure of groups of order $2q^m$**: A group $G$ of this order has a Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ of order $q^m$ and a Sylow 2-subgroup $P$ of order 2. By Sylow's theorems, since $q$ is an odd prime, the Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ is unique and therefore normal in $G$. This means $G$ is a semidirect product, $G = Q \\rtimes P \\cong Q \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$. For $G$ to be nonabelian, this semidirect product must be non-trivial.\n2.  **Use a known theorem about filled groups**: A key theorem by V. A. Petrov states that a finite group $G$ of order $2k$ with $k$ odd is a filled group if and only if its normal subgroup of order $k$ is not a union of two of its own conjugacy classes.\n3.  **Apply the theorem to our case**: Here, the order is $2q^m$, so $k = q^m$ which is odd. The normal subgroup of order $k$ is the Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$. The theorem implies that our group $G$ is filled if and only if $Q$ is not a union of two of its conjugacy classes.\n4.  **Prove that Q cannot be a union of two conjugacy classes**: We will show this by contradiction.\n    *   Assume $Q$ is a union of two of its conjugacy classes, $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n    *   The identity element, $1_Q$, forms its own conjugacy class, $\\{1_Q\\}$, of size 1. So, one of the classes, say $C_1$, must be $\\{1_Q\\}$.\n    *   This forces the other class, $C_2$, to contain all other elements of $Q$. Thus, the size of $C_2$ is $|Q| - 1 = q^m - 1$.\n    *   A fundamental property of groups is that the size of any conjugacy class must divide the order of the group. Therefore, $|C_2|$ must divide $|Q|$, which means $q^m - 1$ must divide $q^m$.\n    *   The greatest common divisor of $q^m$ and $q^m - 1$ is 1. For $(q^m - 1)$ to divide $q^m$, it must be equal to 1.\n    *   If $q^m - 1 = 1$, then $q^m = 2$. This is impossible since $q$ is an odd prime.\n5.  **Conclusion**: The assumption is false. $Q$ can never be the union of two conjugacy classes. Therefore, by the theorem, *any* group of order $2q^m$ (nonabelian or abelian) is a filled group.\n\nThe question asks specifically for the nonabelian ones. Our conclusion means that every nonabelian group of order $2q^m$ is a filled group. The following Python script demonstrates the core argument for specific values of $q$ and $m$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_filled_groups_of_order_2q_m(q: int, m: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains why all nonabelian groups of order 2*q**m \n    are filled, for a given odd prime q and natural number m.
