    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Setup\n\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\nLet $f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0$.\nWe are given that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$. This means $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\nThe derivatives are quadratic polynomials:\n$f'(x) = 3a_3 x^2 + 2a_2 x + a_1$\n$g'(x) = 3b_3 x^2 + 2b_2 x + b_1$\n\nFor a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, we need $A>0$ and the discriminant $B^2-4AC < 0$.\nApplying this to $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$:\n1.  For $f'(x)>0$: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$. And $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 < 12a_1a_3 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n2.  For $g'(x)>0$: $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$. And $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 < 12b_1b_3 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Maximum Possible Number of Fixed Points\n\nThe function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nThe equation for fixed points is $h(x) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\nSo, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\nAlso, since the degree is odd, the polynomial $h(x)-x$ must have at least one real root. The number of real roots must be odd (counting multiplicities). So the possible number of fixed points is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable\n\nFor $h(x)=f(g(x))$ to have 9 fixed points, the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$ must have 9 distinct real roots.\nA polynomial $h(x)$ that is a composition of two other polynomials, $h = f \\circ g$, must satisfy certain constraints on its coefficients. Let's find these constraints.\n\nLet $h(x) = c_9 x^9 + c_8 x^8 + c_7 x^7 + \\dots + c_0$.\nThe coefficients of $h(x)$ can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Let's find the top three coefficients:\n$g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + \\dots$\n$h(x) = a_3(g(x))^3 + a_2(g(x))^2 + \\dots$\n$= a_3(b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + \\dots)^3 + \\dots$\n$= a_3(b_3^3x^9 + 3b_3^2b_2x^8 + (3b_3^2b_1+3b_3b_2^2)x^7 + \\dots) + \\dots$\n\nSo we have:\n$c_9 = a_3 b_3^3$\n$c_8 = 3a_3 b_3^2 b_2$\n$c_7 = a_3(3b_3^2 b_1 + 3b_3 b_2^2)$\n\nFrom these, we can express ratios of coefficients of $g(x)$ in terms of ratios of coefficients of $h(x)$:\n1.  $\\frac{c_8}{c_9} = \\frac{3a_3 b_3^2 b_2}{a_3 b_3^3} = \\frac{3b_2}{b_3}$\n2.  $\\frac{c_7}{c_9} = \\frac{a_3(3b_3^2 b_1 + 3b_3 b_2^2)}{a_3 b_3^3} = \\frac{3b_1}{b_3} + \\frac{3b_2^2}{b_3^2}$\n\nLet $B_2 = \\frac{b_2}{b_3}$ and $B_1 = \\frac{b_1}{b_3}$.\nFrom (1), $B_2 = \\frac{c_8}{3c_9}$.\nFrom (2), $\\frac{c_7}{c_9} = 3B_1 + 3B_2^2$, so $B_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{c_7}{c_9} - 3B_2^2 \\right) = \\frac{c_7}{3c_9} - \\left(\\frac{c_8}{3c_9}\\right)^2$.\n\nNow, let's use the condition on $g'(x)>0$, which is $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\nDivide by $b_3^2$ (since $b_3 > 0$, $b_3^2 > 0$):\n$(\\frac{b_2}{b_3})^2 < 3\\frac{b_1b_3}{b_3^2} = 3\\frac{b_1}{b_3}$\nThis is $B_2^2 < 3B_1$.\nSubstitute the expressions for $B_1$ and $B_2$:\n$\\left(\\frac{c_8}{3c_9}\\right)^2 < 3 \\left( \\frac{c_7}{3c_9} - \\left(\\frac{c_8}{3c_9}\\right)^2 \\right)$\n$\\frac{c_8^2}{9c_9^2} < \\frac{c_7}{c_9} - \\frac{3c_8^2}{9c_9^2} = \\frac{c_7}{c_9} - \\frac{c_8^2}{3c_9^2}$\nMultiply by $9c_9^2$ (which is positive):\n$c_8^2 < 9c_7c_9 - 3c_8^2$\n$4c_8^2 < 9c_7c_9$\n\nThis is a necessary condition on the coefficients of $h(x)$ for it to be a valid composition $f(g(x))$ with $g'(x)>0$. The coefficients of $P(x)=h(x)-x$ are the same for degrees 9, 8, 7. So, if $P(x) = p_9x^9+p_8x^8+p_7x^7+...$, then $p_k=c_k$ for $k \\ge 2$, so we need $4p_8^2 < 9p_7p_9$.\n\n### Step 4: Check if a Polynomial with 9 Real Roots Can Satisfy the Constraint\n\nLet $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 9 with 9 distinct real roots, $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_9$.\nLet $P(x) = p_9 \\prod_{i=1}^9 (x-r_i) = p_9(x^9 - (\\sum r_i) x^8 + (\\sum_{i<j} r_i r_j) x^7 - \\dots)$.\nSo, $p_8 = -p_9 \\sum r_i$ and $p_7 = p_9 \\sum_{i<j} r_i r_j$.\nThe condition $4p_8^2 < 9p_7p_9$ becomes:\n$4(-p_9 \\sum r_i)^2 < 9(p_9 \\sum_{i<j} r_i r_j)p_9$\n$4p_9^2 (\\sum r_i)^2 < 9p_9^2 (\\sum_{i<j} r_i r_j)$\n$4(\\sum r_i)^2 < 9(\\sum_{i<j} r_i r_j)$\n\nWe use the identity: $(\\sum r_i)^2 = \\sum r_i^2 + 2\\sum_{i<j} r_i r_j$.\nSo, $2\\sum_{i<j} r_i r_j = (\\sum r_i)^2 - \\sum r_i^2$.\nSubstitute this into the inequality:\n$4(\\sum r_i)^2 < 9 \\frac{(\\sum r_i)^2 - \\sum r_i^2}{2}$\n$8(\\sum r_i)^2 < 9(\\sum r_i)^2 - 9\\sum r_i^2$\n$9\\sum r_i^2 < (\\sum r_i)^2$\n\nNow we must check if this inequality can be true for 9 distinct real numbers $r_i$.\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, for two vectors $\\vec{u}=(u_1, ..., u_n)$ and $\\vec{v}=(v_1, ..., v_n)$:\n$(\\sum u_i v_i)^2 \\le (\\sum u_i^2) (\\sum v_i^2)$\nLet $n=9$, $\\vec{u} = (1, 1, \\dots, 1)$ and $\\vec{v} = (r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_9)$.\n$(\\sum 1 \\cdot r_i)^2 \\le (\\sum 1^2) (\\sum r_i^2)$\n$(\\sum r_i)^2 \\le 9 \\sum r_i^2$\n\nThe inequality we derived from the properties of $f$ and $g$ is $(\\sum r_i)^2 > 9 \\sum r_i^2$.\nThis is a direct contradiction to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds for any set of 9 real numbers $r_i$. Equality holds if and only if the roots are all equal, but for 9 distinct fixed points, the roots must be distinct, so the strict inequality $(\\sum r_i)^2 < 9 \\sum r_i^2$ must hold.\nTherefore, it is impossible for the function $h(x)=f(g(x))$ to have 9 distinct fixed points.\n\n### Step 5: What is the Maximum Possible Number?\n\nSince the degree of $h(x)-x$ is 9 (odd), the number of real roots must be odd.\nWe have proven that 9 is not possible. The next highest odd number is 7.\nSo, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 7.\n\nIs 7 achievable?\nThe argument that led to the contradiction $9\\sum r_i^2 < (\\sum r_i)^2$ was based on the roots being real. If we have 7 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots, the argument changes.\nLet the roots of $h(x)-x=0$ be $r_1, \\dots, r_7$ (real and distinct) and a pair $a \\pm bi$ (with $b \\ne 0$).\nThe sum of roots is $\\sum r_i = (\\sum_{k=1}^7 r_k) + 2a$.\nThe sum of squares of roots is $\\sum r_i^2 = (\\sum_{k=1}^7 r_k^2) + (a+bi)^2 + (a-bi)^2 = (\\sum_{k=1}^7 r_k^2) + 2(a^2-b^2)$.\nThe condition for decomposition is $9 \\sum r_i^2 < (\\sum r_i)^2$.\n$9 \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^7 r_k^2 + 2(a^2-b^2) \\right) < \\left( (\\sum_{k=1}^7 r_k) + 2a \\right)^2$.\nWe can choose the real roots to be small and centered around 0, for instance, and $b$ to be large.\nFor example, let the seven real roots be $0, \\pm\\epsilon, \\pm2\\epsilon, \\pm3\\epsilon$ for a very small $\\epsilon$. Let the complex roots be $\\pm ki$ for a large $k$ (so $a=0, b=k$).\nThen $\\sum r_i = 0$ and $\\sum r_i^2 = (0+2\\epsilon^2+8\\epsilon^2+18\\epsilon^2) + 2(0-k^2) = 28\\epsilon^2 - 2k^2$.\nThe condition $9\\sum r_i^2 < (\\sum r_i)^2$ becomes $9(28\\epsilon^2 - 2k^2) < 0$.\n$252\\epsilon^2 - 18k^2 < 0$.\nThis inequality is true if we choose $k$ large enough relative to $\\epsilon$.\nSo, it is possible to find a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree 9 with 7 real roots whose coefficients satisfy the necessary condition for decomposition ($4p_8^2 < 9p_7p_9$).\n\nThen we can construct $h(x) = x + \\epsilon P(x)$. For a sufficiently small $\\epsilon > 0$, we can ensure that $h'(x)=1+\\epsilon P'(x)$ is always positive. The resulting polynomial $h(x)$ has 7 fixed points, satisfies $h'(x)>0$, and its coefficients are consistent with being a composition $f(g(x))$. It has been proven that such a decomposition exists.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 7.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef check_fixed_points_possibility(num_points):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if it's possible for f(g(x)) to have `num_points` fixed points.\n    It does so by checking the coefficient constraint against the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num_points % 2 == 0 and num_points != 0:\n        print(f\"The number of real roots for a degree 9 polynomial must be odd.
