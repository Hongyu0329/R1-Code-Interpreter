    # Define the propositions for the correct answer choice, C.

    Q = "The dog barked."
    R = "The dog was asleep."

    # Explanation of the logical resolution.
    explanation = """
The core of the problem is to explain the contradiction: The dog detected an intruder (P), but the dog did not bark (¬Q). The initial rule 'If P then Q' (P→Q) must be incomplete. Answer C provides the most logical and valid explanation.

The chosen logical statement is:
[(P ∧ ¬R)→Q] ∧ (¬Q ∧ P), ∴ R

This can be broken down as follows:
1.  A refined premise: (P ∧ ¬R)→Q
    This translates to: "If the dog detects an intruder AND is NOT asleep, THEN it will bark." This is a more realistic rule than simply P→Q.

2.  The observed facts: (¬Q ∧ P)
    This translates to: "The dog did not bark AND the dog detected an intruder." This is the paradox we need to resolve.

3.  The logical conclusion: ∴ R
    This means the argument validly concludes: "Therefore, the dog was asleep."

The argument is valid because if we accept the refined premise and the observed facts, the only way for both to be true is if the dog was asleep (R). If the dog was not asleep (¬R), its detection of the intruder (P) would have forced it to bark (Q), which contradicts the fact that it did not bark (¬Q).

This successfully resolves the paradox by introducing a logical and plausible reason (R) for why the expected outcome did not occur.
