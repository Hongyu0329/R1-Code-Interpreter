    The solution to this problem proceeds in several steps:

    Step 1: Characterize the space P(X).
    The space X is a compact, connected metric space with more than one point. Such a space is called a continuum and has the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by c or 2^aleph_0.
    The space P(X) consists of all sets of the form {x_1, x_2, ...} U {x}, where x_n is a sequence of points in X that converges non-trivially to x.
    A set of this form is a compact set with exactly one limit point (the point x). Conversely, any compact set with exactly one limit point must be of this form.
    So, P(X) is the subspace of 2^X consisting of compact sets with exactly one limit point.

    Step 2: Show that P(X) is a Baire space.
    The question concerns the intersection of a countable number of open dense subsets, which strongly suggests using the Baire Category Theorem. This theorem states that in a Baire space, such an intersection is dense.
    - The space 2^X (of non-empty closed subsets of X with the Hausdorff metric) is a compact metric space, and therefore a complete metric space.
    - A key result in hyperspace theory is that for a continuum X, the set of all subsets with exactly one limit point is a G_delta set in 2^X. A G_delta set is a countable intersection of open sets.
    - A G_delta subset of a complete metric space is itself completely metrizable, which implies it is a Baire space.
    - Thus, P(X) is a Baire space.

    Step 3: Apply the Baire Category Theorem.
    Let {G_n} be a countable collection of open dense subsets of P(X). Since P(X) is a Baire space, their intersection G = cap G_n is a dense subset of P(X).

    Step 4: Determine the cardinality of the intersection G.
    To find the smallest possible cardinality of G, we need to find the cardinality of P(X).
    - The space X is separable (since it's a compact metric space). This implies that P(X) is also separable.
    - As a completely metrizable and separable space, P(X) is a Polish space.
    - P(X) contains no isolated points; it is a perfect space. Given any convergent sequence F in P(X), we can always construct another distinct sequence F' arbitrarily close to F in the Hausdorff metric.
    - Therefore, P(X) is a perfect Polish space. A fundamental theorem of descriptive set theory states that any non-empty perfect Polish space has the cardinality of the continuum.
    - The intersection G is a dense G_delta subset of the perfect Polish space P(X). This implies that G is also a perfect Polish space and thus must also have the cardinality of the continuum.
    - This result is independent of the specific choice of X (as long as it meets the conditions) and the specific open dense sets. Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is fixed.

    Step 5: Final Conclusion.
    The smallest possible cardinality of the intersection is the cardinality of the continuum. We can express this in the following equation:

    # The problem involves mathematical concepts that are not represented by standard numerical types.

    print(explanation)
    print("Final Equation:")
    # "output each number in the final equation"
    print(f"|G| = {base}^({exponent_symbol})")
    print(f"\nThe smallest possible cardinality is the cardinality of the continuum, {cardinality_symbol} or {cardinality_expression}.")
