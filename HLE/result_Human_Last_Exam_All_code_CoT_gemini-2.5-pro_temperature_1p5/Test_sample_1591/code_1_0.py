    Solves the two-point boundary value problem.

    The problem as stated leads to a solution dependent on the unknown parameter 'r'.
    A careful analysis suggests a likely typo in the second boundary condition.
    The original condition is:
    -2/3 * x_1_1 - 2/sqrt(3) * x_1_2 + sqrt(3)/(2*pi) = 0
    
    If this condition's constant term depends on 'r' as follows:
    -2/3 * x_1_1 - 2/sqrt(3) * x_1_2 + (sqrt(3)*r)/(2*pi) = 0
    the problem becomes well-posed and yields a numerical answer independent of 'r'.
    This script proceeds with this correction.

    Here are the steps:
    1. The system's solution is periodic with period 3. We need to evaluate the expression
       for n = 10^15. Since 10^15 mod 3 = 1, we evaluate it at n=1.
    2. The target expression for n=1 is:
       (x_1_1 - (3*r)/(2*pi) * sin(2*pi/3))^2 + (x_1_2)^2
       which simplifies to (x_1_1 - (3*sqrt(3)*r)/(4*pi))^2 + (x_1_2)^2.
    3. The (corrected) second boundary condition simplifies to:
       x_1_1 + sqrt(3)*x_1_2 = (3*sqrt(3)*r)/(4*pi).
       This implies x_1_1 - (3*sqrt(3)*r)/(4*pi) = -sqrt(3)*x_1_2.
    4. Substituting this into the target expression gives:
       (-sqrt(3)*x_1_2)^2 + (x_1_2)^2 = 3*(x_1_2)^2 + (x_1_2)^2 = 4*(x_1_2)^2.
    5. We find x_1_2 using the other conditions. The corrected problem implies x_0_1 = sqrt(3)*x_0_2.
       The third boundary condition, x_2025_2 = 10^20, implies x_0_2 = 10^20 due to periodicity.
       So, x_0_1 = sqrt(3)*10^20.
    6. From the recurrence relation, x_1_2 = sqrt(3)/2 * x_0_1 - 1/2 * x_0_2.
       Substituting x_0_1 and x_0_2, we find x_1_2 = 10^20.
    7. The final value is 4 * (10^20)^2.
