    "To find the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixels that form the line. Then, we can find the pixel in the middle of that sequence.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Implement Bresenham's Algorithm:** Write a function that takes the start and end coordinates, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and generates the list of all pixels on the line. For the given coordinates (1, 1) and (11, 5), the slope is between 0 and 1, so we'll iterate along the x-axis and decide when to increment the y-axis.\n2.  **Calculate Deltas:** Find the change in x (dx) and y (dy).\n    *   dx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   dy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n3.  **Initialize Decision Parameter:** The initial decision parameter `p` is calculated as `2 * dy - dx`.\n4.  **Generate Pixels:** Starting from (1, 1), loop `dx` times. In each step, we increment `x` and use the decision parameter to determine if `y` should also be incremented. We'll store each generated pixel in a list.\n5.  **Find the Central Pixel:** Once the list of all pixels is generated, the central pixel is the one at the middle index of the list. For a list with an odd number of elements, this is straightforward. The total number of pixels will be `dx + 1 = 11`. The middle index will be `(11 - 1) / 2 = 5` (using 0-based indexing).\n6.  **Print the Result:** The final script will print the list of all generated pixels and then the coordinates of the central pixel.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates all pixels on a line using Bresenham's algorithm and finds the central one.\n    This implementation is for slopes between 0 and 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Decision parameter\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n    \n    # Store points on the line\n    points = []\n    \n    x, y = x1, y1\n\n    # Loop for dx steps\n    for _ in range(dx + 1):\n        points.append((x, y))\n        \n        if x == x2:\n            break\n            \n        x += 1\n        if p < 0:\n            # y doesn't change\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n        else:\n            # y increments\n            y += 1\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n\n    print(\"All pixels on the line using Bresenham's algorithm:\")\n    print(points)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Find the central pixel\n    mid_index = len(points) // 2\n    central_pixel = points[mid_index]\n\n    print(f\"Total number of pixels: {len(points)}\")\n    print(f\"The central pixel is the {mid_index + 1}th pixel in the list.\")\n    print(f\"The coordinates of the central pixel are: {central_pixel}\")\n\n# Given line coordinates\nstart_point = (1, 1)\nend_point = (11, 5)\n\nfind_central_pixel(start_point[0], start_point[1], end_point[0], end_point[1])\n<<<(6, 3)>>>\n```"
