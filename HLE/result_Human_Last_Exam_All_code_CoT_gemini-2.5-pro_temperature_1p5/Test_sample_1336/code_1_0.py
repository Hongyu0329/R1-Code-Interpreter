    Calculates the total number of smooth coverings for a given prime p > 5.

    The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings of D(PSL(2,p), b, w)
    by D(SL(2,p), b, w). This number corresponds to the degree of the covering map
    between the groups SL(2,p) and PSL(2,p).

    The degree of this covering is the order of the kernel of the projection
    homomorphism from SL(2,p) to PSL(2,p). The kernel is the center of SL(2,p).

    The order of the center of SL(n, q) is given by gcd(n, q-1).
    For SL(2,p), this is gcd(2, p-1).

    For any prime p > 5, p is an odd prime. Therefore, p-1 is an even number.
    The greatest common divisor of 2 and any even number is 2.
