    "Of course. The task is to identify a specific Oscar-nominated film from a clue about a key scene.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the film and the specific scene based on the clue provided. The clue is about a character saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus (or similar public transit), which seals their fate.\n2.  The film is \"The Fugitive\" (1993). In a pivotal scene, Dr. Richard Kimble is on a Chicago 'L' train and overhears the one-armed man, Frederick Sykes, say \"Thank you.\" This allows Kimble to finally place the man at the scene of his wife's murder, which ultimately leads to the villain's downfall.\n3.  Write a Python script that prints this information as the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_movie_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the film based on the provided clue.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"The Fugitive\"\n    scene_description = (\n        \"In this 1993 Oscar-nominated film, the character Frederick Sykes (the 'one-armed man') \"\n        \"is identified by the hero, Dr. Richard Kimble. While boarding a Chicago 'L' train \"\n        \"(often misremembered as a bus), Sykes says 'Thank you.' Kimble overhears this, \"\n        \"recognizes the voice from the night of his wife's murder, and this realization seals Sykes' fate.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"The film you are looking for is: {film_title}\")\n    print(\"\\nScene Explanation:\")\n    print(scene_description)\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nsolve_movie_trivia()\n```\n<<<The Fugitive>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
