# - Molecular Weight: ~258 g/mol
# - Heavy Atoms: 18 (12 C, 6 O)
# - Valence Electrons: 102
# - Rings: 3 saturated heterocycles in a bridged bicyclic system
# - Functional Groups: 1 ketone, 5 ethers
# - H-bond acceptors: 6 (all oxygens)
# - H-bond donors: 0
# - Rotatable Bonds: 0
# - All other forbidden groups and structural features are absent.
