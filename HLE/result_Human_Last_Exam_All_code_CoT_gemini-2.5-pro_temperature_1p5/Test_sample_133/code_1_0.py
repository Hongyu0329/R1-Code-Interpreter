def find_optimal_connect4_move():
  """
  This function determines the optimal move for 'O' in the given Connect 4 board state.

  Based on a step-by-step analysis:
  1. There are no moves that result in an immediate win for 'O'.
  2. The move 'f' (placing a token at f4) creates a forced win.
     - It creates a horizontal threat (d4-e4-f4) that 'X' must block at either c4 or g4.
     - Regardless of how 'X' blocks, 'O' can play in column 'f' again on the next turn.
     - This second move in column 'f' places a token at f3, completing a winning diagonal (c6-d5-e4-f3).
  3. No other move provides a similarly forced win.

  Therefore, the single optimal move is 'f', which places a piece at f4.
