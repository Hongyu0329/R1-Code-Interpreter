# The final answer is a choice from the list, not a result of a calculation.
# However, to meet the user's request for a code block, I will print the reasoning.

# Plan:
# 1. Define the criteria for successful co-expression in E. coli using two plasmids:
#    - Compatible origins of replication (e.g., ColE1 and CDF).
#    - Different antibiotic resistance markers for selection.
# 2. Analyze each option against these criteria.
# 3. Identify invalid options due to incompatible origins or improper vector type.
# 4. Compare the valid options to determine the "best" or most powerful and flexible system.
# 5. The combination of a pET vector (ColE1 origin) and a pCDFDuet vector (CDF origin) is ideal.
#    - The origins are compatible.
#    - The selection markers are different.
#    - The Duet vector is specifically designed to express multiple proteins (e.g., a multi-subunit chaperone complex).
