        "     Therefore, cf(c) must be greater than omega. So, gamma > aleph_0.",

        "   - The cardinality of any ordinal alpha < omega_2 is at most aleph_1 (since omega_2 is the first ordinal with cardinality aleph_2).",
        "   - The cofinality of an ordinal, cf(alpha), is a regular cardinal and cf(alpha) <= |alpha|. So, cf(alpha) <= aleph_1.",

        "   - Combining our findings: we have aleph_0 < gamma and gamma <= aleph_1.",

        "   - Therefore, the 'set of possible values' for c is just the singleton set {c}.",
        "   - The order type of a singleton set is 1. So, delta = 1.",
