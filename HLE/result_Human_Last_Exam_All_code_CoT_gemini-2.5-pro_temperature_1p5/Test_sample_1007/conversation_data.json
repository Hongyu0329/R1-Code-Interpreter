    "To solve this, I will analyze the definition of each ballet step to determine if it concludes in the same leg position from which it began. I will use a Python script to structure this analysis. The script will define each step and a key property: whether the feet's starting and ending positions are the same. It will then process this information to identify and print the correct answer with an explanation.\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** An `entrechat` with an even number of beats (like two, four, or six) always returns to the original starting position. Six movements constitute three full changes, bringing the legs back to how they started.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** The term `changé` explicitly means \"changed.\" The dancer starts with one foot in front and lands with the other foot in front.\n*   **Assemblé:** This step involves \"assembling\" the legs in the air. In common forms like `assemblé dessus` (over), the back foot moves to the front, changing the position.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** In this gliding step, the foot that starts in front closes to the back, changing the position.\n*   **Gargouillade:** This is a complex jump that typically results in the feet switching their front/back orientation upon landing.\n\nBased on these definitions, `Entrechat six` is the only step that finishes in the same position it starts. The following Python code will confirm this.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same\n    starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    ballet_steps = [\n        {\n            \"option\": \"A\",\n            \"name\": \"Entrechat six\",\n            \"changes_feet\": False,\n            \"explanation\": \"An even-numbered entrechat (like six) involves a series of beats that returns the legs to their original starting position.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"option\": \"B\",\n            \"name\": \"Échappé battu changé\",\n            \"changes_feet\": True,\n            \"explanation\": \"The word 'changé' explicitly means the feet have changed their position upon landing.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"option\": \"C\",\n            \"name\": \"Assemblé\",\n            \"changes_feet\": True,\n            \"explanation\": \"A standard assemblé (e.g., 'dessus' or 'dessous') involves the working leg changing its position relative to the supporting leg (e.g., moving from back to front).\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"option\": \"D\",\n            \"name\": \"Glissade derrière\",\n            \"changes_feet\": True,\n            \"explanation\": \"In this traveling step, the foot that starts in front finishes in the back, changing the feet.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"option\": \"E\",\n            \"name\": \"Gargouillade\",\n            \"changes_feet\": True,\n            \"explanation\": \"This intricate step typically concludes with the feet in the opposite position from the start.\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n    correct_answer = None\n\n    print(\"Analyzing each ballet step:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n\n    for step in ballet_steps:\n        if not step[\"changes_feet\"]:\n            correct_answer = step\n        \n        position_status = \"Ends in the same position\" if not step[\"changes_feet\"] else \"Ends in a different position\"\n        print(f\"({step['option']}) {step['name']}: {position_status}\")\n        print(f\"   Reason: {step['explanation']}\\n\")\n\n    if correct_answer:\n        print(\"-\" * 75)\n        print(\"Conclusion:\")\n        print(f\"The correct answer is '{correct_answer['name']}', as it is the only step listed that, by definition, has the same starting and ending leg position.\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
