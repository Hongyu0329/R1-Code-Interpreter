The question asks if there exists a smooth, divergence-free, and periodic initial data u_0
for the 2D Navier-Stokes equation,
    ∂_t u + u⋅∇u = Δu - ∇p,  ∇⋅u=0
such that the solution u blows up in finite-time.

The answer to this question is definitively NO.

It is a classical and fundamental result in the mathematical theory of fluid dynamics that for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, solutions starting from smooth initial data exist and remain smooth for all time. This property is known as "global regularity".

Why is this the case?
The proof relies on what are known as "a priori estimates". By taking the L2 inner product of the equation with the solution u, one can show that the kinetic energy is non-increasing:
    (d/dt) ||u(t)||_L2^2 <= 0
This provides a basic level of control.

The crucial step involves analyzing the equation for the vorticity, ω = curl(u). In 2D, the vorticity is a scalar and satisfies the equation:
    ∂_t ω + u⋅∇ω = Δω
A key feature of the 2D equations is that the "vortex stretching" term, which is present in 3D and is the source of the difficulty there, is absent. This allows one to prove that the L^p norms of the vorticity remain bounded for all time. These bounds on the vorticity can then be used to show that all derivatives of the velocity field u also remain bounded for all time.

Conclusion:
Since any smooth initial condition leads to a solution that remains smooth forever, it is impossible for the solution to "blow up" in finite time. Therefore, no such initial data u_0 that causes a finite-time blow-up exists.
