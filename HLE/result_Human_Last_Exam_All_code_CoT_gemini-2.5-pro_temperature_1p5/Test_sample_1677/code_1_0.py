    This function identifies and prints the incorrect or inappropriate options
    explaining the trend in Japanese university entrants.

    Plan:
    1.  Analyze each provided option (A, B, C, D, E) based on factual information about Japanese education and demographics.
    2.  Option A is incorrect because the decline in the 18-year-old population was severe, not smaller than predicted.
    3.  Option B is correct, as the university enrollment rate has significantly increased.
    4.  Option C is a correct, albeit minor, contributing factor.
    5.  Option D is inappropriate because it mischaracterizes the primary role of specialized and junior colleges. They are not primarily "prep schools" for universities.
    6.  Option E is correct, as government policies have supported the expansion of universities.
    7.  The incorrect/inappropriate options are therefore A and D.
    8.  Print the identified letters in alphabetical order, separated by a comma.
