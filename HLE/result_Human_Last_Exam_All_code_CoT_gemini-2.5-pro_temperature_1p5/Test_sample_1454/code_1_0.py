# The reasoning is primarily theoretical and based on fractal geometry.
# A numerical simulation could illustrate the structure of F, but the core
# of the argument lies in analyzing the connectivity of an abstract graph.

# Let's represent the logic in code.
# The vertices of the graph are the elements of D.
D = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]

# We build an adjacency list for the graph.
# An edge (d1, d2) exists if f_d1(F) and f_d2(F) can intersect.
adj = {d: [] for d in D}

# Case 1 & 2: d_x values are the same.
# Intersection is possible if we can find x such that (x,0) and (x,1) are in F.
# We argued this is true (e.g., for x=1).
# This connects d=(dx, j) and d'=(dx, j+1).
for dx in [0, 3]:
    for j in range(3):
        d1 = (dx, j)
        d2 = (dx, j + 1)
        adj[d1].append(d2)
        adj[d2].append(d1)

# Case 3: d_x values are different (0 and 3).
# Intersection is impossible because it would require x1 = x2 + 3 for x1, x2 in [0,1].

# Now we find the number of connected components of the graph using a traversal (like BFS or DFS).
