    "I will scan the Latin hexameter line provided. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Vowel Quantity Analysis**: I will break the line down into its component syllables. Then, I will determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable based on standard rules:\n    *   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong.\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants or a double consonant (x, z).\n\n2.  **Handling Elision**: I will identify and apply elision, where a word ending in a vowel or `-m` is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or `h`. This typically results in the first syllable being dropped or merged with the second.\n\n3.  **Identifying Metrical Feet**: I will group the resulting syllables into six metrical feet. The first four feet can be either a dactyl (long-short-short, D) or a spondee (long-long, S). The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n\n4.  **Code Generation**: Finally, I will create a Python script to print the final scansion clearly, showing the division of the line into feet and representing each foot as either 'D' for dactyl or 'S' for spondee. The script will also print the final pattern.\n\nThis particular line presents some challenges that require careful application of the rules. My analysis indicates the most plausible scansion is Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee (D S S S D S).\n\n```python\ndef print_scansion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of the Latin hexameter line:\n    \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    \n    # Based on metrical analysis, the line is divided into feet as follows.\n    # Elisions are noted: ver(um) ubi, equ(i) atque, convenit i(mago)\n    # The scansion requires some standard poetic licenses.\n    \n    foot1_word = \"verum ubi\"\n    foot1_syllables = \"vē - rŭ - bĭ\"\n    foot1_meter = \"D\"\n    \n    foot2_word = \"equi atque\"\n    foot2_syllables = \"ē - qu'ātque\"\n    foot2_meter = \"S\"\n    \n    foot3_word = \"hominis\"\n    foot3_syllables = \"hōm - nĭs\"\n    foot3_meter = \"S\"\n\n    foot4_word = \"casu\"\n    foot4_syllables = \"cā - sū\"\n    foot4_meter = \"S\"\n    \n    foot5_word = \"convenit i-\"\n    foot5_syllables = \"cŏn - vĕ - nĭt\" #This foot presents a known difficulty.\n                                   # For a more regular scansion let's assume convēnit (perfect)\n    foot5_syllables_alt = \"vē - nĭt - ĭ\"\n    foot5_meter_alt = \"D\"\n    \n    foot6_word = \"-mago\"\n    foot6_syllables = \"mā - gō\"\n    foot6_meter = \"S\"\n    \n    # A highly plausible scansion is D-S-S-S-D-S.
