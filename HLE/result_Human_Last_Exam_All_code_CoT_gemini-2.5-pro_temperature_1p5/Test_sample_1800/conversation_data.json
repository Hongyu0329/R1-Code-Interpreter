    "The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic performance is not a single universal value but depends heavily on the synthesis method, reaction conditions (temperature, pressure), and the specific morphology of the nanoparticles. However, extensive research in catalysis provides a well-established range for optimal performance.\n\nGenerally, a low to moderate nickel loading on the ceria support is most effective. This ensures high dispersion of nickel particles, maximizes the metal-support interface, and leverages the redox properties of ceria (Ce³⁺/Ce⁴⁺ cycling), which is crucial for both the Water Gas Shift and water splitting reactions. A commonly cited optimal composition is around 15 atomic percent (at%) of Nickel.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script to calculate the Ni/Ce molar ratio based on this representative value from the scientific literature.\n\n1.  **Define Atomic Percentages:** I will set the atomic percentage of Ni to 15% and consequently, Ce to 85%.\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio:** The Ni/Ce ratio is calculated by dividing the atomic percentage of Ni by the atomic percentage of Ce.\n3.  **Print the Result:** The script will print a clear explanation along with the calculation, showing each number in the equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_optimal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a representative ideal Ni/Ce ratio based on values\n    frequently reported in scientific literature for high catalytic activity.\n\n    While the absolute optimal ratio can vary, a common composition for\n    highly effective Ni-Ceria catalysts is around 15 atomic percent (at%) Ni.\n    This function calculates the corresponding Ni/Ce molar ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the atomic percentages based on literature data.\n    # Total atoms are Ni + Ce = 100%.\n    ni_atomic_percent = 15.0\n    ce_atomic_percent = 85.0\n\n    # Calculate the molar ratio of Ni to Ce.\n    # For atomic percentages, the ratio is simply the division of the percentages.\n    ni_ce_ratio = ni_atomic_percent / ce_atomic_percent\n\n    print(\"Based on scientific literature, a highly effective composition for Ni-Ceria catalysts is often around 15 at% Ni.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to 85 at% Ce in the metal composition.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the ideal Ni/Ce ratio from these values, we perform the following calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{ni_atomic_percent} (Ni) / {ce_atomic_percent} (Ce) = {ni_ce_ratio:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, a representative ideal Ni/Ce ratio is approximately {ni_ce_ratio:.3f}.\")\n\ncalculate_optimal_ratio()\n\n# The final answer is the numerical value of the ratio.\n# The calculation is 15 / 85\nfinal_answer = 15.0 / 85.0\n# The final answer should be a number.\n# Using .3f for formatting, the answer is 0.176\nfinal_answer = 0.176\n```\n<<<0.176>>>"
