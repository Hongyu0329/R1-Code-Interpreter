    "This problem requires us to compute the Poincaré polynomial for a given 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. The Poincaré polynomial is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Lie algebra structure.** The commutation relations are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$, with all other brackets of basis vectors being zero. This algebra is nilpotent. We can identify a structure that simplifies the computation. The algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be represented as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a}$, where $\\mathfrak{a} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal.\n\n2.  **Use the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.** For a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a}$ with $\\mathfrak{a}$ abelian, the Poincaré polynomial can be computed using a collapsing spectral sequence. In our case, $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathbb{R}e_1$. The result is that the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is related to the Poincaré series of the kernel of the action of $\\mathfrak{h}$ on the exterior algebra of the dual of $\\mathfrak{a}$. The formula is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x) P_{\\ker(ad_{e_1}^*)}(x)$, where $P_{\\ker(ad_{e_1}^*)}(x) = \\sum_{q=0}^{5} \\dim(\\ker(ad_{e_1}^*)|_{\\wedge^q \\mathfrak{a}^*}) x^q$.\n\n3.  **Determine the action of $ad_{e_1}^*$ on $\\mathfrak{a}^*$.** Let $\\{e^1, \\dots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_6\\}$. The action of $L = ad_{e_1}^*$ on a dual vector $e^i$ is given by $(L e^j)(e_k) = -e^j([e_1, e_k])$. We find:\n    *   $L(e^2) = -e^3$\n    *   $L(e^3) = -e^4$\n    *   $L(e^4) = 0$\n    *   $L(e^5) = -e^6$\n    *   $L(e^6) = 0$\n    This action of $L$ extends to the whole exterior algebra $\\wedge \\mathfrak{a}^* = \\wedge(e^2, e^3, e^4, e^5, e^6)$ as a graded derivation of degree 0.\n\n4.  **Decompose the problem.** The space $\\mathfrak{a}^*$ splits into two $L$-invariant subspaces: $V_A = \\text{span}\\{e^2, e^3, e^4\\}$ and $V_B = \\text{span}\\{e^5, e^6\\}$. Let $L_A$ and $L_B$ be the restrictions of $L$ to $V_A$ and $V_B$. Then $\\wedge \\mathfrak{a}^* = (\\wedge V_A) \\otimes (\\wedge V_B)$, and the derivation is $L = L_A \\otimes 1 + 1 \\otimes L_B$. A key property is that the Poincaré series for the kernel of this sum of derivations is the product of the Poincaré series for the individual kernels: $P_{\\ker(L)}(x) = P_{\\ker(L_A)}(x) \\cdot P_{\\ker(L_B)}(x)$.\n\n5.  **Compute $P_{\\ker(L_A)}(x)$ and $P_{\\ker(L_B)}(x)$**.\n    *   For the system on $A = \\wedge V_A = \\wedge(e^2, e^3, e^4)$:\n        *   $\\dim\\ker(L_A|_{\\wedge^0 A}) = 1$ (the element 1)\n        *   $\\dim\\ker(L_A|_{\\wedge^1 A}) = 1$ (spanned by $e^4$)\n        *   $\\dim\\ker(L_A|_{\\wedge^2 A}) = 1$ (spanned by $e^3 \\wedge e^4$)\n        *   $\\dim\\ker(L_A|_{\\wedge^3 A}) = 1$ (spanned by $e^2 \\wedge e^3 \\wedge e^4$)\n        So, $P_{\\ker(L_A)}(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3$.\n    *   For the system on $B = \\wedge V_B = \\wedge(e^5, e^6)$:\n        *   $\\dim\\ker(L_B|_{\\wedge^0 B}) = 1$ (the element 1)\n        *   $\\dim\\ker(L_B|_{\\wedge^1 B}) = 1$ (spanned by $e^6$)\n        *   $\\dim\\ker(L_B|_{\\wedge^2 B}) = 1$ (spanned by $e^5 \\wedge e^6$)\n        So, $P_{\\ker(L_B)}(x) = 1 + x + x^2$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final polynomial.**\n    *   $P_{\\ker(L)}(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)(1 + x + x^2) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n    *   $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x) P_{\\ker(L)}(x) = (1+x)(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$.\n    *   $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe following python code will perform the polynomial multiplication to get the final Poincaré polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# P_ker_A(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3\np_ker_A = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1])\n\n# P_ker_B(x) = 1 + x + x^2\np_ker_B = np.array([1, 1, 1])\n\n# P_ker(x) = P_ker_A(x) * P_ker_B(x)\np_ker = np.polymul(p_ker_A, p_ker_B)\n\n# P_g(x) = (1 + x) * P_ker(x)\np_g = np.polymul(np.array([1, 1]), p_ker)\n\n# Format the output string for the polynomial\n# The coefficients are ordered from highest degree to lowest\ncoeffs = p_g[::-1]\npoly_str = []\nfor i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n    if c == 0:\n        continue\n    # Do not print coefficient if it is 1 and not the constant term\n    coeff_str = \"\" if (c == 1 and i > 0) else str(int(c))\n    \n    # Do not print power if it is 0\n    if i == 0:\n        var_str = \"\"\n    # Do not print power if it is 1\n    elif i == 1:\n        var_str = \"x\"\n    else:\n        var_str = f\"x^{i}\"\n    \n    # Combine coefficient and variable part\n    term = f\"{coeff_str}{var_str}\"\n    \n    poly_str.append(term)\n\nprint(\"The Poincaré polynomial is: P(x) =\", \" + \".join(poly_str))\n# The final task asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# This means we should print the polynomial in its expanded form.\n# The code above already generates the string representation.\n```\n<<<1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6>>>"
