The obstructions are classified by elements of the group $\pi_1(\text{Aut}(E))$, which is constructed from the following groups:
1. $H_{n-1}(X)$ (The $(n-1)$-th homology group of $X$)
2. $\pi_1(SO(2k))$ (The fundamental group of the special orthogonal group $SO(2k)$)
3. $\pi_n(SO(2k))$ (The $n$-th homotopy group of $SO(2k)$)
