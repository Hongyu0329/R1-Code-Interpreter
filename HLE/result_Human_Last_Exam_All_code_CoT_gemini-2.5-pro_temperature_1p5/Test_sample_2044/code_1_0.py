    # The biological principle
    principle = (
        "In the rat olfactory bulb, there is a well-defined spatial map for processing odors, "
        "known as a chemotopic map. For a series of similar odorants that only differ by the "
        "length of their carbon chain (like aliphatic aldehydes), their processing location is organized "
        "along the anterior-posterior (front-to-back) axis."
    )

    # The specific rule
    rule = (
        "Specifically, odorants with SHORTER carbon chains activate glomeruli in the ANTERIOR part of the olfactory bulb. "
        "As the carbon chain gets LONGER, the area of activation shifts systematically to the POSTERIOR part of the bulb."
    )

    analysis_header = "Evaluating the choices based on this principle:"
    choices_analysis = [
        "A. Long chain molecules ... more anteriorly -> Incorrect.",
        "B. Long chain molecules ... more posteriorly -> This is a correct statement.",
        "C. Short chain molecules ... more anteriorly -> This is also a correct statement.",
        "D. Long chain molecules ... more superiorly -> Incorrect. The axis is anterior-posterior.",
        "E. Long chain molecules ... more inferiorly -> Incorrect. The axis is anterior-posterior."

    # Justification for the final choice
    justification = (
        "Both B and C are factually correct. They describe the same organizational gradient from opposite ends. "
        "However, when describing a map, it's common and logical to define its starting point. The map "
        "for carbon chain length starts with short chains at the anterior end. Therefore, C provides a "
        "fundamental description of the rule."
