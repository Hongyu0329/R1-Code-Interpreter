    This function solves the hat puzzle by calculating the guaranteed number of correct guesses

    # n is the number of individuals.

    # The problem states: "Each hat is either black and yellow or blue and white."
    # This implies a binary choice between two types of hats.
    # Therefore, the number of distinct hat choices, k, is 2.
    k = 2

    # --- Scenario 1: N, Simultaneous Guessing ---
    # The optimal strategy is to partition the group to bet on the value of the
    # sum of all hats modulo k. To maximize the guaranteed number of correct
    # guesses, the groups must be as equal in size as possible. The guaranteed
    # number of correct guesses is the size of the smallest group.
    # This is given by the formula floor(n / k).
    N = math.floor(n / k)

    # --- Scenario 2: M, Sequential Guessing ---
    # One person (the speaker) sacrifices their guess to signal information to
    # the other n-1 people (the listeners). The speaker can see the n-1 listeners' hats
    # and announce the sum of their colors modulo k. This allows each of the n-1
    # listeners to deduce their own hat color with certainty.
    # The guaranteed number of correct guesses is the number of listeners.

    # --- Final Calculation ---
    # The question asks for M - N, the number of additional people who will
    # definitely guess correctly in the second scenario.
