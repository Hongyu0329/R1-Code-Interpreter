    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will identify the problem. The user is asking for the value of `a(4)`, where `a(n)` is a mathematical sequence representing the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of `n` variables.\n\nSecond, I will find a formula for `a(n)`. This is a known sequence in digital logic and combinatorics. For values of `n` up to 5, it has been established that `a(n)` is equal to the central binomial coefficient, which is calculated as `C(2n, n)`.\n\nThird, I will apply this formula for the case where `n = 4`. This means calculating `a(4) = C(2*4, 4) = C(8, 4)`.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that performs this calculation and prints out the steps of the equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k),\n    which is n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    # This calculation is efficient for small numbers like the ones in this problem.\n    # It calculates (n * (n-1) * ... * (n-k+1)) / (k * (k-1) * ... * 1)\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    if k > n // 2:\n        k = n - k\n    \n    res = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        res = res * (n - i) // (i + 1)\n    return res\n\n# The problem asks for a(4), where a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants\n# of a Boolean function of n variables.\nn_val = 4\n\n# For n <= 5, a(n) is given by the formula a(n) = C(2n, n), where C is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n# We will calculate a(4) using this identity.\nN = 2 * n_val\nK = n_val\n\n# Calculate the final result.\nresult = combinations(N, K)\n\n# To fulfill the request, we will print out the equation with all numbers.\nnumerator_terms = list(range(N, N - K, -1))\ndenominator_terms = list(range(K, 0, -1))\n\nprint(f\"The maximal number of prime implicants, a(n), for a Boolean function of n variables follows the identity a(n) = C(2n, n) for n <= 5.\")\nprint(f\"For n = {n_val}, the calculation is a(4) = C(2*{n_val}, {n_val}) = C({N}, {K}).\")\nprint(f\"The final equation and its solution are:\")\n\n# Format the equation string.\nequation_str = f\"a(4) = C({N}, {K}) = ({' * '.join(map(str, numerator_terms))}) / ({' * '.join(map(str, denominator_terms))}) = {result}\"\nprint(equation_str)\n```\n<<<70>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables.
