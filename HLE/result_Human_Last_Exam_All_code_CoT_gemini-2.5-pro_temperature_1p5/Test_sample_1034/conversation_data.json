    "This problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines (SSA), where we are given two sides and a non-included angle. For there to be two possible triangles (and thus two possible values for the third side, AB), the length of the side opposite the given angle (AC) must be greater than the altitude from the common vertex (C) but less than the length of the other given side (BC).\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Assign the given values.**\n    *   The side `BC` is given by `S = SNYWR`. On a standard keyboard layout, this corresponds to the numbers 2, 6, 7, 3, and 4. So, `BC = 26734`.\n    *   The angle `m∠B = 30°`.\n\n2.  **Define the condition for two possible triangles.**\n    *   Let `a = BC`, `b = AC`, and `h` be the altitude from vertex C to the line containing side AB.\n    *   The altitude `h` is calculated as `h = a * sin(B)`.\n    *   For there to be two distinct possible triangles, the length of side `b` (which is AC) must satisfy the inequality: `h < b < a`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the bounds for the length of AC.**\n    *   `a = BC = 26734`.\n    *   `B = 30°`, so `sin(B) = 0.5`.\n    *   `h = 26734 * 0.5 = 13367`.\n    *   Therefore, the inequality for the length of AC is `13367 < AC < 26734`.\n\n4.  **Count the number of integer values.**\n    *   We need to find the number of integers that `AC` can be within this range.\n    *   The smallest possible integer for AC is `13367 + 1 = 13368`.\n    *   The largest possible integer for AC is `26734 - 1 = 26733`.\n    *   The total number of integers is `(Last Integer - First Integer) + 1`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Assign the given values.\n# S = SNYWR maps to 26734.\nBC = 26734\nangle_B_degrees = 30\n\n# Step 2: Define the condition for two possible triangles.\n# In triangle ABC, let a = BC, b = AC. The condition for two solutions is h < b < a,\n# where h is the altitude from C, given by h = a * sin(B).\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the bounds for the length of AC.\n# Convert angle B to radians for the sin function.\nangle_B_radians = math.radians(angle_B_degrees)\n# a = BC\na = BC\n# Calculate the altitude h, which is the lower bound for AC.\nh = a * math.sin(angle_B_radians)\n\n# The bounds for AC are (h, a).\nlower_bound = h\nupper_bound = a\n\nprint(f\"For two possible triangles, the length of AC must be between the altitude h and the length of side BC.\")\nprint(f\"Side BC = {upper_bound}\")\nprint(f\"Altitude h = BC * sin(B) = {a} * sin({angle_B_degrees}°) = {lower_bound}\")\nprint(f\"So, the condition is {lower_bound} < AC < {upper_bound}.\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Step 4: Count the number of integer values for AC.\n# The smallest integer value for AC is floor(h) + 1.\n# The largest integer value for AC is ceil(a) - 1.\nfirst_integer_AC = int(lower_bound) + 1\nlast_integer_AC = int(upper_bound) - 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of integers.\ncount = last_integer_AC - first_integer_AC + 1\n\nprint(f\"The number of possible integer values for AC is the count of integers in the range ({first_integer_AC}, {last_integer_AC}), inclusive.\")\nprint(\"The calculation is:\")\n# Output the final equation as requested\nprint(f\"Number of values = {last_integer_AC} - {first_integer_AC} + 1 = {count}\")\n\n```\n<<<13366>>>"
