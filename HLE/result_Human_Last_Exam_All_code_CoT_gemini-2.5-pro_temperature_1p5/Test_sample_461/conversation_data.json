    "The creature you're referring to is the Pterodactyl, which, while technically a pterosaur and not a dinosaur, lived during the same era and went extinct at the same time (around 65 million years ago). Its name was given to a polycyclic hydrocarbon because the molecule's structural formula resembles the shape of a Pterodactyl in flight.\n\nThe molecule is called **Pterodactyladiene**.\n\nHere is a Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_hydrocarbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature that went extinct approximately 65 million years ago.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The creature is the Pterodactyl, and the molecule's shape resembles it.\n    hydrocarbon_name = \"Pterodactyladiene\"\n    \n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is: {hydrocarbon_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_hydrocarbon()\n```\n<<<Pterodactyladiene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
