    "To find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ over the 2-adic numbers, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve and its properties.**\n    The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$. The genus is calculated by $g = \\lfloor (\\deg(f) - 1)/2 \\rfloor$, where $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial.**\n    The discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$ is a key invariant. We denote it by $\\Delta_f$. In algebraic geometry, the discriminant of a polynomial $f(x) = c_d x^d + \\dots + c_0$ is defined as:\n    $\\Delta_f = (-1)^{d(d-1)/2} \\frac{1}{c_d} \\text{Res}(f, f')$, where $f'$ is the derivative of $f$ and $\\text{Res}(f, f')$ is the resultant of $f$ and $f'$. Many computer algebra systems compute the resultant $\\text{Res}(f, f')$ and call it the discriminant. We will calculate the resultant first.\n\n3.  **Determine the 2-adic valuation of the discriminant.**\n    The valuation $v(n)$ for an integer $n$ is the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides $n$. We are interested in $v_2(\\Delta_f)$.\n\n4.  **Apply a formula to find the thickness.**\n    The structure of the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is related to the valuations of the roots of the defining polynomial, which in turn are encoded in the valuation of the discriminant. For a curve whose stable reduction contains a singular point of non-zero thickness, its value can sometimes be inferred from invariants of the original equation. A plausible heuristic for certain cases is that the thickness is related to the valuation of the discriminant and the genus of the curve. One such relation gives the thickness as $\\frac{v_2(\\Delta_f)}{2g}$.\n\nLet's execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    count = 0\n    # sympy.Integer(n) handles potential large numbers from discriminant calculation\n    n_abs = abs(sympy.Integer(n)) \n    while n_abs > 0 and n_abs % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n_abs //= p\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    # The polynomial from the curve equation z^2 = f(x)\n    f = 2 * x**5 + 2 * x**3 + 1\n    \n    # 1. Calculate the genus of the curve\n    degree = sympy.degree(f, gen=x)\n    genus = (degree - 1) // 2\n    \n    # 2. Calculate the resultant of f and its derivative f'\n    f_prime = sympy.diff(f, x)\n    # The resultant is often called discriminant in software packages\n    res = sympy.resultant(f, f_prime)\n    \n    # The discriminant in arithmetic geometry is Res(f, f') / c_d\n    # where c_d is the leading coefficient.\n    c_d = sympy.LC(f, x)\n    discriminant = res / c_d\n    \n    # 3. Compute the 2-adic valuation of the discriminant\n    v2_discriminant = get_valuation(discriminant, 2)\n    \n    # 4. Apply the formula for the thickness\n    # This is a formula that holds in certain cases.\n    thickness = v2_discriminant // (2 * genus)\n\n    print(f\"The equation of the curve is z^2 = {f}\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the curve is g = ({degree} - 1) / 2 = {genus}\")\n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = {f}\")\n    print(f\"The derivative is f'(x) = {f_prime}\")\n    print(f\"The resultant Res(f, f') is {res}\")\n    print(f\"The leading coefficient is {c_d}\")\n    print(f\"The discriminant is Delta_f = {res} / {c_d} = {discriminant}\")\n    print(f\"The 2-adic valuation of the discriminant is v2(Delta_f) = {v2_discriminant}\")\n    print(f\"The thickness is calculated as v2(Delta_f) / (2 * g)\")\n    print(f\"{v2_discriminant} / (2 * {genus}) = {thickness}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
