# Step 1: Define the given physical constants.

E_1s = 1.0  # Resonance peak for the 1s exciton in eV

# Step 2: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton (E_b_1s).
# The exciton resonance energy is the band gap minus the binding energy.
# E_1s = E_g - E_b_1s  =>  E_b_1s = E_g - E_1s
E_b_1s = E_g - E_1s

# Step 3: Calculate the effective Rydberg energy (R_y*).
# For a 2D system, the binding energy is E_b_n = R_y* / (n - 0.5)^2.
# For the ground state (n=1), this becomes E_b_1s = R_y* / (1 - 0.5)^2 = R_y* / (0.5)^2 = 4 * R_y*.
# Therefore, R_y* = E_b_1s / 4.
R_y_star = E_b_1s / 4.0

# Step 4: Calculate the Rydberg energy (binding energy) for n = 3 (E_b_3).
# We use the 2D binding energy formula with n=3.
# E_b_3 = R_y* / (3 - 0.5)^2
E_b_3 = R_y_star / (n - 0.5)**2
