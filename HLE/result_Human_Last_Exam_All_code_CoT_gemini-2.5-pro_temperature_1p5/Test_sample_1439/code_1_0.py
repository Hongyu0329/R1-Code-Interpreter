    """
    Determines the order in the coupling constant 'u' where the critical exponent 'ν'
    receives its first non-vanishing contribution at the non-trivial fixed point.

    In φ⁴ theory, the critical exponent ν is expanded around its mean-field value (ν_0 = 1/2).
    The expansion is in terms of the coupling constant 'u' evaluated at the
    Wilson-Fisher fixed point, u*.

    The general form of the expansion is:
    ν = ν_0 + c_1*(u*)^1 + c_2*(u*)^2 + ...

    We want to find the power of u* in the first correction term, c_1*(u*)^1.
