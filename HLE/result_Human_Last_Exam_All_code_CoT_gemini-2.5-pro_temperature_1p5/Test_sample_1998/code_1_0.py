# Step 1: Define the u-invariant of the residue field k.
# The residue field k is a local field of characteristic 2.
# It is a standard result that the u-invariant of any local field is 4.
u_k = 4
print(f"The residue field k is a local field. Its u-invariant, u(k), is {u_k}.")

# Step 2: Calculate the u-invariant of the field K.
# K is a complete discretely valued field with residue field k.
# By the characteristic 2 version of Springer's Theorem, u(K) = 2 * u(k).
u_K = 2 * u_k

print(f"Its u-invariant, u(K), is calculated by Springer's Theorem: u(K) = 2 * u(k) = 2 * {u_k} = {u_K}.")

# Step 3: Determine the smallest natural number N.
# The problem asks for the smallest N such that every anisotropic quadratic form
# in N variables is surjective. This condition is met if no such forms exist.
# The maximum dimension of an anisotropic form is u(K).
# Therefore, the smallest dimension N for which no anisotropic forms exist is u(K) + 1.
N = u_K + 1
