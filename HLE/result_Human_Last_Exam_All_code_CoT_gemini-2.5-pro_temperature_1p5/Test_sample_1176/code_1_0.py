    Solves the Cordilleran geology quiz by evaluating each statement.

    This function analyzes ten statements about the Cenozoic-Cretaceous geologic history
    of the North American Cordillera. Each statement is classified as either a
    consensus view ('C') or a debated statement ('D'). The final answer is a
    continuous string of these classifications.

    Statement Analysis:
    1. Morrison formation as a foredeep deposit: Consensus (C). It is a classic example of a foreland basin deposit east of the Sevier orogenic belt.
    2. Metamorphic core complexes from a slab window: Debated (D). This is a prominent hypothesis, but other models like gravitational collapse or slab rollback are also heavily debated.
    3. "Nevadaplano" plateau by the end of the Cretaceous: Consensus (C). The concept of a high-elevation plateau in this region during this time is a widely accepted and influential model.
    4. "Arizonaplano" via magmatic thickening: Debated (D). The existence and formation mechanism of a southern plateau in Arizona are much less certain and more controversial than the Nevadaplano.
    5. Laramide structures are inboard of Sevier structures: Consensus (C). This is a fundamental observation of the spatial relationship between thin-skinned (Sevier) and thick-skinned (Laramide) deformation.
    6. Sierra Nevada and Idaho Batholiths from the ancestral arc: Consensus (C). It is a foundational concept that these batholiths are the roots of the Mesozoic Cordilleran magmatic arc.
    7. Eocene ignimbrites propagating southwest: Debated (D). This statement conflates the Eocene volcanic flare-up with the younger, Miocene-to-present southwestward propagation of the Yellowstone hotspot track. The link as a single continuous process is not consensus.
    8. Colorado Plateau at modern elevations by the late Cretaceous: Debated (D). The timing of the Colorado Plateau's uplift is one of the most significant and long-standing debates in North American geology.
    9. Cascades at modern elevation by the late Oligocene: Debated (D). The modern High Cascades are a young Pliocene-Quaternary feature; the older Oligocene arc was distinct and did not have the same elevation or character.
    10. Laramide deformation caused by Shatsky conjugate subduction: Debated (D). While flat-slab subduction is the consensus mechanism for the Laramide orogeny, the *reason* for the slab flattening (e.g., subducting an oceanic plateau) is a major point of debate.
