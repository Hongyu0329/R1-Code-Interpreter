    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish Known Diet:** I will first recall or look up the documented diet of adult Raphidiopterans from entomological sources. It is known that they are primarily predators but also supplement their diet.\n2.  **Evaluate Individual Choices:** I will assess each of the answer choices (A, B, C, D, E) against the established diet.\n    *   **A. Nectar:** Check if nectar consumption is recorded.\n    *   **B. Māhoe pollen:** Check if pollen consumption is recorded.\n    *   **C. Fungus:** Check if fungus consumption is recorded.\n    *   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Check if they are herbivores that eat leaf tissue.\n    *   **E. Totara Aphids:** Check if they are predators of aphids.\n3.  **Evaluate Combined Choices:** Based on the evaluation of the individual choices, I will assess the combined choices (F and G).\n4.  **Conclude:** Select the most accurate and comprehensive answer from the list.\n\nI will implement this logic in a Python script that prints out the step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\ndef find_snakefly_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the established diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # They are known to be predators of small, soft-bodied insects and also to consume plant-based sugars and proteins.\n    known_diet = {\n        \"Predatory\": [\"Aphids\", \"Mites\", \"Insect eggs\", \"Small insect larvae\"],\n        \"Supplementary\": [\"Pollen\", \"Nectar\"]\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate each individual food source from the choices.\n    # Choice A: Nectar\n    choice_A_food = \"Nectar\"\n    is_A_correct = choice_A_food in known_diet[\"Supplementary\"]\n    print(f\"Analyzing Choice A: {choice_A_food}\")\n    print(f\"Result: Raphidiopterans have been recorded feeding on {choice_A_food}.
