    "To find the main projection target of the ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will use the `neuprint-python-eel` library to query the latest *C. elegans* connectome data available on the neuPrint platform (Witvliet et al., 2021).\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Connect to the `c_elegans_isbi_2021:v1` dataset on the neuPrint server.\n2.  Write a Cypher query to find all outgoing connections from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  The query will retrieve the postsynaptic neuron partners and the number of synapses (weight) for each connection.\n4.  I will then process the results using the `pandas` library. I'll group the connections by the postsynaptic neuron and sum the synapse counts from both ASJL and ASJR to find the total synaptic input from ASJ to each target.\n5.  Finally, I will sort these targets in descending order of their total synapse count to identify the main target.\n6.  The code will print the ranked list of targets and then show the detailed calculation for the top target, breaking down the synapse numbers from ASJL and ASJR, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom neuprint import Client\n\ndef find_asj_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Connects to the C. elegans neuPrint server to find the main synaptic\n    target of the ASJ neuron pair.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Connect to the neuPrint server and select the C. elegans dataset\n        # This public dataset does not require an authentication token.\n        c = Client('https://neuprint.org', dataset='c_elegans_isbi_2021:v1')\n        c.fetch_version()\n        print(\"Successfully connected to neuPrint server.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error connecting to neuPrint: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please check your internet connection and the server status.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 2: Define the presynaptic neurons and the Cypher query\n    pre_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n    cypher_query = f\"\"\"\n    MATCH (pre:Neuron)-[r:ConnectsTo]->(post:Neuron)\n    WHERE pre.name IN {pre_neurons}\n    RETURN pre.name AS presynaptic, post.name AS postsynaptic, r.weight AS synapses\n    \"\"\"\n\n    try:\n        # Step 3: Fetch the connection data\n        results_df = c.fetch_cypher(cypher_query)\n        if results_df.empty:\n            print(f\"No connections found for neurons: {pre_neurons}\")\n            return\n\n        # Step 4: Aggregate the results to find the total synapses for each target\n        total_synapses = results_df.groupby('postsynaptic')['synapses'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).astype(int)\n\n        # Step 5: Identify the main target\n        main_target = total_synapses.index[0]\n        total_count = total_synapses.iloc[0]\n\n        # Get the individual synapse counts from ASJL and ASJR for the main target\n        main_target_connections = results_df[results_df['postsynaptic'] == main_target]\n        asjl_row = main_target_connections[main_target_connections['presynaptic'] == 'ASJL']\n        asjr_row = main_target_connections[main_target_connections['presynaptic'] == 'ASJR']\n        \n        asjl_count = asjl_row['synapses'].iloc[0] if not asjl_row.empty else 0\n        asjr_count = asjr_row['synapses'].iloc[0] if not asjr_row.empty else 0\n\n        # Step 6: Print the results clearly\n        print(\"\\n---\")\n        print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ in terms of synapse number is: {main_target}\")\n        print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n        # Print the final equation with each number\n        print(f\"ASJL -> {main_target} ({asjl_count}) + ASJR -> {main_target} ({asjr_count}) = {total_count} synapses\")\n        print(\"\\nFull list of targets ranked by synapse number:\")\n        print(total_synapses.to_string())\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred during data processing: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_asj_main_target()\n<<<AVG>>>\n```"
