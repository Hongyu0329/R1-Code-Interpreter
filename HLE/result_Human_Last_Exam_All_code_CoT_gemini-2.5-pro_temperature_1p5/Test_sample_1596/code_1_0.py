def solve_quaternion_rope():
  """
  This function identifies and returns the correct statements about the Quaternion RoPE formulation.

  After a step-by-step analysis of each statement from A to N based on the
  provided quaternion mathematics and RoPE definitions, the following statements
  are determined to be true:

  - C: The rotation axis must be fixed for the positional encoding to have consistent
       relative properties.
  - E: Rotation by a unit quaternion is an isometry, preserving the norm (magnitude).
  - F: Multiplication by a real scalar is a linear operation that commutes with
       quaternion multiplication.
  - G: The rotation preserves the inner product between any two quaternion vectors,
       and therefore also preserves orthogonality (a special case of inner product being zero).
  - H: The composition of two rotations around the same axis is another rotation around
       that axis, with an angle that is the sum of the original angles.
  - J: The rotation operators R_m and R_n commute because they are coaxial. Their
       commutator is zero, which is a purely imaginary quaternion (real part is zero).
  - L: The trace of the 4x4 matrix representation for left multiplication by a
       quaternion q = a + ... is 4a. For R_m, a = cos(mÎ¸).

  The letters corresponding to the true statements are C, E, F, G, H, J, L.
