# In this problem, we need to calculate the stable amplitude factor chi.
# The derivation shows that chi is a function of the dimensionless product of the
# wavenumber k and the plate thickness h. The formula is:
# chi = (k*h * cosh(k*h)) / (cosh(k*h)^2 + (k*h)^2)
#
# Since the values for k and h are not provided, we cannot calculate a single
# numerical answer. However, we are asked to provide a code solution.
# We will demonstrate the calculation for a representative value of k*h = 2.0.

# Define the value for the dimensionless product k*h
kh = 2.0

# Calculate the components of the equation for chi
cosh_kh = np.cosh(kh)
numerator = kh * cosh_kh
denominator = cosh_kh**2 + kh**2
chi = numerator / denominator

# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
# Here are the components of the calculation for k*h = 2:
print("Calculation for the amplitude factor chi with k*h = 2:")
print(f"Value of k*h = {kh}")
print(f"Value of cosh(k*h) = np.cosh({kh}) = {cosh_kh:.4f}")
print(f"Numerator = {kh} * {cosh_kh:.4f} = {numerator:.4f}")
print(f"Denominator = ({cosh_kh:.4f})^2 + {kh}^2 = {denominator:.4f}")
print(f"chi = {numerator:.4f} / {denominator:.4f} = {chi:.4f}")

# The final answer is the value of chi.
print("\nFinal Answer:")
print(f"<<<{chi:.4f}>>>")
