def solve_limit_size():
    """
    This function demonstrates the calculation of a limit for a specific functor
    to find the smallest possible size of such a limit.

    The problem is to find the smallest possible size of lim_{J^op}F, where:
    - J is a directed poset.
    - F: J^op -> Set is a functor.
    - F(j) is a non-empty set for all j in J.
    - All maps in the image of F are surjective.

    Step 1: Theoretical lower bound.
    A key theorem in category theory states that such a limit is always non-empty.
    This means the size of the limit must be >= 1.

    Step 2: Construct an example to find the minimum.
    We check if a size of 1 is achievable. We can construct a system
    that satisfies the conditions and has a limit of size 1.

    - Let J be the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...} with the usual order <=.
      This is a directed poset.
    - Let F(j) be a singleton set, e.g., {'*'}, for every j in J.
    - The maps F(j1) -> F(j2) for j2 <= j1 are uniquely determined and are surjective.

    This Python code models a finite version of this example.
