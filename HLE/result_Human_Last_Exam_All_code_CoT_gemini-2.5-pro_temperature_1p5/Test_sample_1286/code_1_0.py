    The question asks to identify a feature that has a strong positive effect on word acquisition for children but a strong negative effect for Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and BERT. Let's analyze the options:

    1.  **Effect on Children:** Children's learning is 'grounded' in physical, sensory experience. Therefore, words referring to concrete, tangible things they can see, touch, or interact with are learned earlier and more easily. This means features like 'word concreteness' and 'word imageability' have a strong POSITIVE effect on child language acquisition. In contrast, high frequency is also positive, but complexity and length generally have a negative effect.

    2.  **Effect on LLMs:** LLMs learn from text patterns alone, without any grounding in physical reality. They learn a word's meaning based on its surrounding text (its context).
        *   **Word Frequency (G):** This has a strong POSITIVE effect. The more a model sees a word, the better it learns its statistical distribution.
        *   **Word Concreteness (A):** This has been shown to have a NEGATIVE effect. Abstract words (e.g., 'justice', 'theory') are often defined and explained by other words in the text, providing clear, learnable context for the model. Concrete words (e.g., 'apple', 'ball') are used in a huge variety of contexts but are rarely defined ('an apple is a fruit...'), as it's assumed the reader knows what it is. Without sensory input, the model struggles to pin down a stable meaning from these diverse contexts.

    **Conclusion:**
    Word concreteness is a feature where the effect is inverted between children and LLMs.
    - For Children: Higher concreteness -> Easier to learn (Positive effect)
    - For LLMs: Higher concreteness -> Harder to learn (Negative effect)

    Therefore, 'word concreteness rating' is the correct answer.
