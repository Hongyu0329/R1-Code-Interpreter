    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The gravitational field outside a non-rotating, uncharged, spherically symmetric body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n2.  **Define Coordinates and Metric Tensor**: We use spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$. The Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its non-zero components are:\n    *   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{R_s}{r}\\right)$\n    *   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{R_s}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{22} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n    where $R_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2}$ is the Schwarzschild radius.\n\n3.  **Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are calculated using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n\n4.  **Automated Calculation**: Since manual calculation is prone to errors, we will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform symbolic calculations. The plan for the code is as follows:\n    *   Define the symbolic coordinates and the Schwarzschild radius $R_s$.\n    *   Construct the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and its inverse $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ as `sympy` matrices.\n    *   Implement a nested loop to iterate through all 64 components of the Christoffel symbol tensor $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$.\n    *   Inside the loop, apply the formula to compute each component.\n    *   Simplify the resulting expression and check if it is non-zero.\n    *   Print each non-zero component and its symbolic expression.\n    *   Maintain a counter for the non-zero components and print the total count at the end. This count will be the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
