    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. This method involves forming an augmented matrix by stacking P1 on top of P2, and then using elementary row operations to reduce this matrix to a form where the lower part consists of zero rows. The remaining non-zero rows will form a GCRD.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define Matrices**: First, we define the two polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, using Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`.\n2.  **Form Augmented Matrix**: We create a single matrix `M` by vertically stacking P1 and P2. The dimensions of `M` will be 4x2.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n3.  **Perform Row Reduction**: We apply a series of elementary row operations to `M`. An elementary row operation can be:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero polynomial.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n    The goal is to introduce zero rows at the bottom of the matrix. These operations are equivalent to pre-multiplying `M` by a unimodular matrix.\n4.  **Extract GCRD**: After the reduction process, the remaining non-zero rows will form a matrix `G`. This matrix `G` is a GCRD of P1 and P2. The GCRD is not unique; any matrix `U(s)G(s)` where `U(s)` is a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant) is also a GCRD.\n5.  **Normalize**: We will normalize the resulting GCRD to its simplest canonical form, which is often the identity matrix if the original matrices are right co-prime.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan to find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of\n    two given polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the symbolic variable and matrices\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Step 2: Form the augmented matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n\n    # Step 3: Perform elementary row operations to reduce M\n    # Let the initial rows be R0, R1, R2, R3\n    \n    # Operation 1: R0_new = R0 + s * R3\n    # This zeroes out the first row\n    M_R0 = M.row(0)\n    M_R3 = M.row(3)\n    M.row_del(0)\n    M.row_insert(0, M_R0 + s * M_R3)\n\n    # Operation 2: R1_new = R1 - s^2 * R3 (using the original R1 and R3)\n    # This simplifies the second row\n    M_R1_orig = sympy.Matrix([[-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n    M_R3_orig = sympy.Matrix([[-s - 1, 1]])\n    M.row_del(1)\n    M.row_insert(1, M_R1_orig - (s**2) * M_R3_orig)\n    \n    # After the first two operations, M is:\n    # [[0, 0],\n    #  [s**3 - 1, 0],\n    #  [s, 0],\n    #  [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n    # Now, reduce further using the current state of M\n    # Operation 3: R1_new = R1 - s^2 * R2\n    # Based on Euclidean division of s**3-1 by s\n    M_R1 = M.row(1)\n    M_R2 = M.row(2)\n    M.row_del(1)\n    M.row_insert(1, M_R1 - (s**2) * M_R2)\n\n    # M is now:\n    # [[0, 0],\n    #  [-1, 0],\n    #  [s, 0],\n    #  [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n    # Operation 4: R2_new = R2 + s * R1 (using the new R1)\n    M_R1 = M.row(1)\n    M_R2 = M.row(2)\n    M.row_del(2)\n    M.row_insert(2, M_R2 + s * M_R1)\n\n    # Operation 5: R3_new = R3 - (s+1) * R1 (using the new R1)\n    M_R1 = M.row(1)\n    M_R3 = M.row(3)\n    M.row_del(3)\n    M.row_insert(3, M_R3 - (s+1) * M_R1)\n\n    # The final reduced matrix M is:\n    # [[0, 0],\n    #  [-1, 0],\n    #  [0, 0],\n    #  [0, 1]]\n    \n    # Step 4: Extract the non-zero rows to form the GCRD\n    # The non-zero rows are [-1, 0] and [0, 1].\n    # A GCRD is given by the matrix formed by these rows.\n    G = sympy.Matrix([\n        [-1, 0],\n        [0, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Step 5: Normalize the GCRD.
