    "My plan is to identify the exact verses (bayt) in the classical Islamic poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that list the names of the prophets. To do this, I will:\n\n1.  Pinpoint the standard numbering for the verses in the poem.\n2.  Locate the section dedicated to the prophets (Anbiya').\n3.  Identify the starting verse where the enumeration of names begins.\n4.  Identify the ending verse where the list of names concludes.\n5.  Write a Python script that will clearly state this range using the `print` function and also display the specific verses for the user's reference.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses_in_aqeedat_al_awaam():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and displays the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam\n    that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # According to standard editions of the poem, the enumeration of the 25\n    # prophets begins at verse 30 and ends at verse 33.\n    start_bayt = 30\n    end_bayt = 33\n\n    # The verses (bayt) containing the names of the prophets.\n    # The poem is in Arabic.\n    prophet_verses = {\n        30: \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ * صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n        31: \"لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\",\n        32: \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n        33: \"إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the final answer clearly\n    print(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam, the names of the prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"The specific verses are:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Loop through and print each verse with its number\n    for number, text in prophet_verses.items():\n        print(f\"Bayt {number}: {text}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_prophets_verses_in_aqeedat_al_awaam()\n```\n<<<30-33>>>"
