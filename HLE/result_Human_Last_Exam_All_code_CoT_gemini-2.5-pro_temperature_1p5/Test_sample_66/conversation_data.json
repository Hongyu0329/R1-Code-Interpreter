    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Flag's Structure:** The flag of Tonga is primarily red. It has a white rectangle in the canton (the top-left corner), which contains a red \"couped\" cross.\n2.  **Create a Matrix Model:** We'll represent the flag as a matrix where red pixels have a symbolic value `a` and white pixels have a value `b`. The overall dimensions of the flag don't matter for the rank, only its structure.\n3.  **Identify Row Patterns:** We'll analyze the rows of this matrix. We can observe that due to the flag's simple geometric design, all the rows in the matrix must belong to one of only two distinct patterns:\n    *   **Type 1 (All-Red):** Rows that are entirely red. These correspond to the main red field of the flag and the horizontal bar of the red cross. Every element in this type of row is `a`.\n    *   **Type 2 (Canton-White):** Rows that pass through the white part of the canton. These rows consist of `b`s (for the white field), an `a` (for the vertical bar of the red cross), and `a`s for the part of the row outside the canton.\n4.  **Determine the Rank:** The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows. Since the entire matrix is composed of only two types of rows, its rank can be at most 2. The *maximal* rank will be 2 if we can choose values for `a` and `b` that make these two row types linearly independent.\n5.  **Test for Linear Independence:** The two row types are linearly independent as long as they are not scalar multiples of each other. This is true for almost any choice of `a` and `b`, for example, when `a=1` and `b=2`, or when `a=1` and `b=0`. The only cases where the rank is less than 2 are special cases, like `a=b` or `a=0`.\n6.  **Code the Solution:** We will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to formalize this. The script will symbolically construct a representative matrix and compute its rank for generic values of `a` and `b`, which will give us the maximal possible rank.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the maximal rank.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_tonga_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga\n    by modeling it with symbolic values 'a' (red) and 'b' (white).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Define symbolic variables for the pixel values.\n    a = sympy.Symbol('a')\n    b = sympy.Symbol('b')\n\n    # 2. Define representative dimensions for the flag's structure.\n    # The specific dimensions are not critical, as the rank depends on the pattern.\n    m, n = 12, 18  # Total flag dimensions (height, width)\n    h, w = 6, 9    # Canton dimensions (height, width)\n    cross_row, cross_col = 4, 5 # Position of the red cross (1-indexed)\n\n    # 3. Construct the matrix `M` based on the flag's design.\n    matrix_rows = []\n    for i in range(m):\n        row_list = []\n        for j in range(n):\n            # Check if the pixel is in the canton (top-left section)\n            if i < h and j < w:\n                # Inside the canton, check for the red cross\n                if i == cross_row - 1 or j == cross_col - 1:\n                    row_list.append(a)  # Pixel is part of the red cross\n                else:\n                    row_list.append(b)  # Pixel is in the white field of the canton\n            else:\n                # Outside the canton, the flag is red\n                row_list.append(a)\n        matrix_rows.append(row_list)\n\n    M = sympy.Matrix(matrix_rows)\n\n    # 4. Determine the rank.\n    # The rank of a symbolic matrix in Sympy is calculated for generic values of its symbols.\n    # This corresponds to the maximal possible rank, which occurs when the fundamental\n    # row types are linearly independent (e.g., when a != b and a != 0).\n    max_rank = M.rank()\n\n    # 5. Print the result.\n    print(\"The maximal possible rank of the matrix for the flag of Tonga is:\")\n    print(max_rank)\n\nsolve_tonga_flag_rank()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
