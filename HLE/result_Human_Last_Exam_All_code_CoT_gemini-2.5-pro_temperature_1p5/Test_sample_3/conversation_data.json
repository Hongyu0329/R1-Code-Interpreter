    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to find the answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical context:** The problem is about the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, which is the set of points of finite order. This subgroup is a finite abelian group. The question is specifically about elliptic curves defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n2.  **Recall the structure of torsion subgroups:** For an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$, its torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ is isomorphic to a group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$, where $n_2$ divides $n_1$. The group is non-cyclic if and only if $n_2 > 1$.\n3.  **Use the classification theorem:** There are complete classifications for the possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields, like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. These classifications, established by mathematicians like Kenku, Momose, and Najman, not only list the possible group structures but also specify over which quadratic fields each structure can occur.\n4.  **List possible groups for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** By consulting the known results, we can compile a definitive list of all non-cyclic torsion groups that are possible for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. These are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 4)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 8)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 12)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 24)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 36)\n5.  **Find the maximum order:** The final step is to calculate the order of each group in the list (which is the product of the orders of the cyclic components) and identify the largest one.\n\nThe following Python script implements this final step.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on the classification theorems for torsion subgroups of elliptic curves\n    # over quadratic fields, the following non-cyclic groups are the only ones that\n    # can appear over K = Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    # The groups are represented as tuples (n2, n1) for the structure Z/n2Z x Z/n1Z.\n    possible_groups = [\n        (2, 2),   # Order 4\n        (2, 4),   # Order 8\n        (2, 6),   # Order 12\n        (2, 12),  # Order 24\n        (3, 3),   # Order 9\n        (3, 6),   # Order 18\n        (6, 6)    # Order 36\n    ]\n\n    max_order = 0\n    best_group_n1 = 0\n    best_group_n2 = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the possible group structures to find the one with the largest order.\n    for n2, n1 in possible_groups:\n        order = n1 * n2\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n            best_group_n1 = n1\n            best_group_n2 = n2\n\n    print(f\"The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)) is {max_order}.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to the group structure Z/{}Z x Z/{}Z.\".format(best_group_n2, best_group_n1))\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    # Print each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"{best_group_n2} * {best_group_n1} = {max_order}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
