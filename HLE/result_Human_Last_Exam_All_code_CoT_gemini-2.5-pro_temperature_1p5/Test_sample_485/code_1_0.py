While 25 ml is a common volume for agar plates in general, specific protocols for twitching motility often call for other volumes (e.g., 15 ml or 20 ml) to create a specific, reproducible agar depth. Therefore, claiming 25 ml is 'typically' used for this specific assay is likely incorrect in the context of a multiple-choice question."
