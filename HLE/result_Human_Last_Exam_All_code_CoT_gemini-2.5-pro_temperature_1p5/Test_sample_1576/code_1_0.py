    # Compare remaining options
    # A (IV lorazepam alone): May be insufficient and requires IV access, which is difficult.
    # B (Repeat 5mg olanzapine + 2mg lorazepam): A reasonable option, bringing total olanzapine to 10mg.
    # D (Repeat 10mg olanzapine): Single-agent escalation might be less effective than combination therapy.
    # E (Repeat 10mg olanzapine + 2mg lorazepam): This is the most robust option. It provides a full therapeutic dose of olanzapine (total of 5mg + 10mg = 15mg) and adds the synergistic effect of lorazepam. This combination has the highest likelihood of successfully and rapidly controlling severe, refractory agitation.
