However, you can have consistency in a network that is fundamentally flawed due to a lack of transitivity. So, it is necessary but not sufficient.",
        "C": "Homogeneity: This assumes effect sizes are similar for studies comparing the same two treatments. Its absence (heterogeneity) does not invalidate the NMA; it simply requires a different statistical model (random-effects). Thus, it is not sufficient for the whole network's validity.",
        "D": "Similarity of Effect Modifiers: This is the practical basis for transitivity (Assumption A). Ensuring similar distribution of effect modifiers (like age, disease severity) across trials is how you argue for transitivity. Like transitivity, it is necessary but not sufficient.",
