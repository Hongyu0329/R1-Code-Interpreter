    "Here is my plan to solve this chess puzzle:\n1.  First, I will analyze the provided FEN string `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1` to understand the current state of the board, including piece positions and material balance.\n2.  White's most significant advantage is the advanced passed pawn on d6. However, Black's active queen on c5 is the main obstacle, as it controls the d-pawn.\n3.  The most decisive move for White is to eliminate the defender of the d-pawn, which is the Black queen.\n4.  The move `Qxc5+` forces a queen trade. Black's only legal response is to recapture with its pawn (`...bxc5`).\n5.  After the queen trade, White's d-pawn is free to advance. White's follow-up move, `d7`, creates an unstoppable threat.\n6.  The Black king is too far away to stop the pawn from promoting on the d8 square. This sequence guarantees a win for White.\n7.  My Python script will print out this step-by-step reasoning and explicitly state the number found in the final move notation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given chess position and determines the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    fen = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the chess position: {fen}\")\n    print(\"White has a Queen on f2 and a very strong passed pawn on d6.\")\n    print(\"Black has a Queen on c5, which is currently the only piece preventing the d6 pawn from advancing.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe optimal strategy for White is to remove the Black Queen.\")\n    \n    winning_move = \"Qxc5+\"\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe best move for White is: {winning_move}\")\n    print(\"\\nHere's why:\")\n    print(f\"1.
