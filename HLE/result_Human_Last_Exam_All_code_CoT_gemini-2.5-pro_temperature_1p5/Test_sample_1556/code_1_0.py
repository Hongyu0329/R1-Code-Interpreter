    Calculates the value of |α|² based on the properties of the quantum circuit.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The circuit B squared is the identity (B² = I). This means if B maps |ψ⟩ to |ψ'⟩, then B also maps |ψ'⟩ back to |ψ⟩.
    2. Therefore, the input state |ψ⟩ can also be considered an output state of the circuit B.
    3. Property 1 states that for any output state, the probability of measuring |1⟩, let's call it P(1), is the square of the probability of measuring |0⟩, P(0). So, P(1) = P(0)².
    4. For our input state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, we have P(0) = |α|² and P(1) = |β|².
    5. Because |ψ⟩ must satisfy the output property, we have |β|² = (|α|²)².
    6. The normalization condition for a qubit is |α|² + |β|² = 1.
    7. Substituting (5) into (6) gives: |α|² + (|α|²)² = 1.
    8. Letting x = |α|², we get the quadratic equation x² + x - 1 = 0.
    
    This script solves this equation for x. The given probability of 0.36 is not needed for this calculation.
