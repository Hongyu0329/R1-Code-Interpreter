    "To solve this problem, we can use a powerful result from differential topology called Morse Theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Introduce Morse Theory:** This theory connects the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold (like the torus) to the topological properties of that manifold.\n2.  **Use Betti Numbers:** The key topological invariants we need are the Betti numbers ($b_k$). For a given manifold, $b_k$ intuitively counts the number of $k$-dimensional \"holes\".\n3.  **Apply the Morse Inequality:** For any smooth function on a compact manifold, the total number of critical points ($C$) must be greater than or equal to the sum of its Betti numbers: $C \\ge \\sum_k b_k$. This gives us a lower bound for the number of critical points.\n4.  **Calculate for the 2-Torus ($T^2$):**\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components is 1.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of independent loops (1D holes) is 2 (one around the tube, one through the hole).\n    *   $b_2$: The number of enclosed voids (2D holes) is 1.\n5.  **Find the Minimum:** By summing the Betti numbers, we find the theoretical minimum number of critical points. It has been shown that this minimum can be achieved by constructing a specific function on the torus (e.g., the standard height function of a torus standing upright on a table), confirming that this bound is tight.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum based on the Betti numbers of the 2-torus.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2) are as follows:\n    # b_0: number of connected components\n    b0 = 1\n    # b_1: number of 1-dimensional \"circular\" holes\n    b1 = 2\n    # b_2: number of 2-dimensional \"cavities\"\n    b2 = 1\n    \n    # According to Morse theory, the minimal number of critical points of a\n    # smooth function on a compact manifold is the sum of its Betti numbers.\n    # A simple example function on the torus that achieves this minimum has:\n    # 1 minimum (index 0, corresponding to b0)\n    # 2 saddle points (index 1, corresponding to b1)\n    # 1 maximum (index 2, corresponding to b2)\n    min_critical_points = b0 + b1 + b2\n    \n    # Print the equation that demonstrates this calculation.\n    print(f\"{b0} + {b1} + {b2} = {min_critical_points}\")\n\nsolve_minimal_critical_points()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
