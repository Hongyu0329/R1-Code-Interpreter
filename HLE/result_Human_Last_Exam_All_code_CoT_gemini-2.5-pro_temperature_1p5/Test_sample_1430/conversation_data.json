    "To find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of X, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate $\\rho(X)$ to the curve C:** For a smooth projective curve C of genus $g$, and its n-th symmetric power $X = C^{(n)}$, there is a well-established formula for the rank of the Néron-Severi group (the Picard number), $\\rho(X)$, provided $n$ is sufficiently large compared to $g$. For $g=3$ and $n=15$, the condition is met, and the formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(n)}) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\n    Here, $J(C)$ is the Jacobian of the curve C, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g$.\n\n2.  **Find the range for $\\rho(J(C))$:** The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a curve C of genus $g=3$. The Picard number of an abelian variety $J$ of dimension $g$ is bounded by:\n    $1 \\leq \\rho(J) \\leq h^{1,1}(J)$\n    where $h^{1,1}(J)$ is a Hodge number of J. For an abelian variety of dimension $g$, $h^{1,1}(J) = g^2$.\n\n3.  **Determine the minimum rank:** For $g=3$, we have $1 \\leq \\rho(J(C)) \\leq 3^2 = 9$. The minimum value, $\\rho(J(C))=1$, is achieved for a \"general\" curve C. Such curves correspond to a dense open set in the moduli space of genus 3 curves. Thus, the minimum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1.\n\n4.  **Determine the maximum rank:** The maximum value, $\\rho(J(C))=9$, is achieved for a special curve with maximal complex multiplication (CM). For a curve of genus 3, an example that achieves this maximum is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$. Its Jacobian has a Picard number of 9. Thus, the maximum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 9.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer:** Using the formula from step 1, we can now calculate the smallest and largest ranks for $\\rho(X)$.\n    *   Smallest rank: $1 + \\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   Largest rank: $1 + \\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate and display the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X,\n    the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3\n    n = 15\n\n    print(f\"Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"Let X be its {n}th symmetric power, X = C^({n}).\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, denoted rho(X), is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, rho(J(C)).\")\n    print(\"For n sufficiently large compared to g (our case n=15, g=3 satisfies this), the formula is:\")\n    print(\"rho(X) = 1 + rho(J(C))\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"The Jacobian J(C) is an abelian variety of dimension g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"The rank rho(J(C)) is bounded by 1 <= rho(J(C)) <= h^{1,1}(J(C)), where h^{1,1}(J(C)) = g^2.\")\n    h11_J = g**2\n    print(f\"For g = {g}, the upper bound is g^2 = {g} * {g} = {h11_J}.\")\n    print(f\"So, for a genus {g} curve, 1 <= rho(J(C)) <= {h11_J}.\\n\")\n\n    # Smallest Rank\n    print(\"--- Smallest Possible Rank ---\")\n    print(\"The minimum value, rho(J(C)) = 1, is achieved for a 'general' curve C.\")\n    rho_J_min = 1\n    rho_X_min = 1 + rho_J_min\n    print(\"The smallest possible rank for rho(J(C)) is 1.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the smallest rank of NS(X) = 1 + {rho_J_min} = {rho_X_min}.\\n\")\n\n    # Largest Rank\n    print(\"--- Largest Possible Rank ---\")\n    print(\"The maximum value is achieved for a special curve with a large endomorphism algebra (e.g., a curve with Complex Multiplication).\")\n    print(f\"For genus g = {g}, the maximum possible value rho(J(C)) = {h11_J} can be achieved.\")\n    print(\"An example is the Fermat quartic curve, whose Jacobian has a Picard number of 9.\")\n    rho_J_max = h11_J\n    rho_X_max = 1 + rho_J_max\n    print(f\"The largest possible rank for rho(J(C)) is {h11_J}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the largest rank of NS(X) = 1 + {rho_J_max} = {rho_X_max}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Summary:\")\n    print(f\"The smallest possible rank is {rho_X_min}.\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible rank is {rho_X_max}.\")\n\n\nsolve_neron_severi_rank()\n```\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.>>>"
