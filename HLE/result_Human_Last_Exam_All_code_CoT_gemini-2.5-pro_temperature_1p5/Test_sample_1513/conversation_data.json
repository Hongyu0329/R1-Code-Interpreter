    "My plan to answer this trivia question is as follows:\n1.  Deconstruct the user's query into key factual constraints.\n    *   It's an \"island town.\"\n    *   It is \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island,\" indicating extreme remoteness.\n    *   It \"sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\"\n    *   The town, bay, and likely the caldera, \"shares the town's name.\"\n2.  Use these constraints to search for the correct location. The combination of extreme remoteness and the shared name for the town and the caldera bay is very specific.\n3.  Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is a prime candidate. Its main town is Hanga Roa.\n4.  Verify the facts for Hanga Roa:\n    *   **Island town:** Yes.\n    *   **Remoteness:** The nearest inhabited land is the Pitcairn Islands, which are over 2,000 km away, satisfying the \"> 500 km\" condition.\n    *   **Volcanic Caldera Bay:** The town sits on Hanga Roa bay. The bay is nestled between the island's three main extinct volcanoes, and its geography is directly shaped by them, particularly the nearby Rano Kau caldera.\n    *   **Shared Name:** The town is named Hanga Roa and the bay is named Hanga Roa. This matches perfectly.\n5.  Based on this, Hanga Roa is the correct answer. I will provide the answer within a python `print()` function to meet the user's request format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function solves the trivia question by identifying the island town.\n  Clues:\n  - Very remote island town (> 500km from other inhabited islands).\n  - Located on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n  - The town and bay share the same name.\n\n  The answer is Hanga Roa, the main town on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n  \"\"\"\n  town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n  print(town_name)\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
