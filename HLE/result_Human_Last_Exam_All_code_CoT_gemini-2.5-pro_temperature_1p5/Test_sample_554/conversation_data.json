    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\", we first need to define what a \"nanocar\" is. The term \"nanocar\" refers to a class of molecules, not a single specific compound. Therefore, we must select a representative example.\n\nFor this task, I will use the **Ohio Bobcat Nanowagon**, a well-documented molecule designed for the first international Nanocar Race. Its structure is known, and it serves as an excellent example of a nanocar.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the chemical formula** of the chosen nanocar, the Ohio Bobcat Nanowagon. Its formula is C48H36.\n2.  **Understand the chemical prefix \"perfluoro-\"**. This term means that every hydrogen (H) atom in the parent molecule is replaced by a fluorine (F) atom.\n3.  **Calculate the number of fluorine atoms**. Since there are 36 hydrogen atoms in the original molecule, a \"perfluoro\" version would have 36 fluorine atoms, resulting in the new formula C48F36.\n4.  **Create a Python script** to present this information and calculation clearly. The script will define the properties of the original molecule and then show the result of the perfluorination process.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoro_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar\n    based on a specific, real-world example.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the chosen nanocar and its chemical properties.\n    # The term \"nanocar\" can refer to many different molecules. We choose a well-defined one.\n    nanocar_name = \"Ohio Bobcat Nanowagon\"\n    # Chemical formula for this nanocar is C48H36.\n    num_carbons = 48\n    num_hydrogens = 36\n\n    # Step 2: The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    # Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the original number of hydrogen atoms.\n    num_fluorines = num_hydrogens\n\n    # Step 3: Print the explanation and the result, showing each number in the process.\n    print(f\"We will base our calculation on a specific molecule, the '{nanocar_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"The chemical formula of the original nanocar is C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe prefix 'perfluoro-' indicates that all {num_hydrogens} hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(f\"The equation for this transformation is: C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens} -> C{num_carbons}F{num_fluorines}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a 'perfluoronanocar' would be equal to the original number of hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(f\"Number of fluorine atoms: {num_fluorines}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_perfluoro_atoms()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
