    "My plan is to create a Python script that will print a detailed, step-by-step comparison of polynucleotides and polysaccharides. The script will not perform any complex calculations but will use `print` statements to clearly outline the structural differences between these two types of polymers, focusing on their monomers, backbone composition, and the chemical bonds that link them. This comparative explanation will lead to a definitive answer to your question.\n\n```python\ndef compare_polymers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the structures of polynucleotides and polysaccharides to determine\n    if they belong to the same structural class.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the structural relationship between polynucleotides and polysaccharides.\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define Polysaccharides\n    print(\"1. Structure of a Polysaccharide (e.g., Cellulose):\")\n    print(\"   - It is a polymer made of repeating monomer units.\")\n    print(\"   - Monomer Unit: A simple sugar (monosaccharide), such as glucose.\")\n    print(\"   - Backbone: Composed of a continuous chain of sugar units.\")\n    print(\"   - Linkage: The monomers are joined by Glycosidic Bonds.\")\n    print(\"   - Example equation for a simple disaccharide (2 units): Sugar + Sugar -> Disaccharide + H2O\\n\")\n\n\n    # Step 2: Define Polynucleotides\n    print(\"2. Structure of a Homopolynucleotide (e.g., poly-Adenine):\")\n    print(\"   - It is also a polymer made of repeating monomer units.\")\n    print(\"   - Monomer Unit: A nucleotide. This monomer is complex and has 3 distinct parts:\")\n    print(\"     Part A: A 5-carbon sugar (e.g., ribose)\")\n    print(\"     Part B: A phosphate group\")\n    print(\"     Part C: A nitrogenous base (e.g., adenine)\")\n    print(\"   - Backbone: An alternating sequence of sugar and phosphate groups (a 'sugar-phosphate backbone').\")\n    print(\"   - Linkage: The monomers are joined by Phosphodiester Bonds.\\n\")\n\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude based on the comparison\n    print(\"3.
