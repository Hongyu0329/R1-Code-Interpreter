    print("   - It is a polymer made of repeating monomer units.")
    print("   - Monomer Unit: A simple sugar (monosaccharide), such as glucose.")

    print("   - Linkage: The monomers are joined by Glycosidic Bonds.")
    print("   - Example equation for a simple disaccharide (2 units): Sugar + Sugar -> Disaccharide + H2O\n")

    print("2. Structure of a Homopolynucleotide (e.g., poly-Adenine):")
    print("   - It is also a polymer made of repeating monomer units.")

    print("   - The monomer of a polysaccharide is a simple sugar. The monomer of a polynucleotide is a nucleotide, which is far more complex.")
    print("   - The backbone of a polysaccharide consists only of sugars. The backbone of a polynucleotide is a sugar-phosphate chain.")
    print("   - The bonds are different: Glycosidic bonds vs. Phosphodiester bonds.")
