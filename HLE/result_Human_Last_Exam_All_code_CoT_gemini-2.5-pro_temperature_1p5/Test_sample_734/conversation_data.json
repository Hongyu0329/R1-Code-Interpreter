    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to arrive at the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core of the question, which asks for a specific Christian theologian. The key criteria for this theologian are:\n1.  They were the *first* to develop this specific line of thought.\n2.  They created *specialized terminology* for it.\n3.  The terminology can describe *changes in the laws of nature*.\n4.  It is applicable to both the *virgin birth* and the *Fall*.\n\nBased on these criteria, the theologian in question is Augustine of Hippo. He argued that miracles are not \"against nature\" (*contra naturam*) in an absolute sense, but rather against nature *as we know it*. He proposed that God, in creation, implanted \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons\" (*rationes seminales* or *causales*)â€”latent potentialities within the natural order.\n\n*   **For the virgin birth:** This would not be a violation of a fixed natural law, but the activation by God of a pre-existing, hidden potential within creation for a human to be conceived in this manner.\n*   **For the Fall:** Augustine taught that the state of nature changed after the Fall. For example, humanity became subject to death and decay, and the earth began to produce \"thorns and thistles.\" This represents a shift in the operating principles of the natural world, a change in its laws.\n\nAugustine's framework of *rationes seminales* provides the specialized terminology and conceptual model to understand these events not as arbitrary divine interventions breaking established laws, but as part of a deeper, pre-ordained order unfolding in time.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Christian theologian\n    who first developed a systematic terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature,\n    applicable to both the virgin birth and the effects of the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(theologian_name)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
