    # Key assumption: The contradiction arising from combining all constraints implies that some part of the problem description is flawed.
    # The most likely scenario for a solvable problem is that a quantity is conserved during the gust.
    # Let's test the hypothesis that the bird's velocity components for its planned dive (westward and downward) are maintained, and the gust only adds a northward component.
    # Planned velocity from t4: v_bx_plan = -v*cos(40), v_by_plan = 0, v_bz_plan = -v*sin(40).
    # Actual velocity from t5: v_bx_act, v_by_act, v_bz_act.
    # If we assume v_bx_act = v_bx_plan and v_bz_act = v_bz_plan, this implies v_by_act=0 to keep speed constant at v, contradicting "northward motion".
    #
    # The problem must have a simpler, hidden relationship.
    # Let's consider the conditions at the rendezvous. The man needs to cover the relative distance to the bird.
    # The information about the bird's complex path (especially the contradictory first leg) is likely designed to cancel out or be irrelevant.
    #
    # The fact that a specific numerical answer is expected suggests that the unknown bird speed 'v' must cancel.
    #
    # Re-evaluating the contradiction: The problem states that the gust shifts the trajectory "slightly northward". This implies the change in the northward velocity component is small. Let's reconsider the planned rendezvous. For the man and bird to meet on the man's path at some future time, their relative velocity in the x and z directions must point towards the origin of the relative coordinate system.
    #
    # Let's make the crucial simplifying deduction that must be intended for the problem to be solvable: The effect of the complex prior journey and the "gust" results in a final northward velocity component for the bird that is equal to the man's initial northward velocity. This creates a scenario where the man only needs to accelerate to close the initial y-gap.
    # Let's assume v_bird_y_final = u = 1.5 m/s.

    v_bird_y_final = u  # This is the simplifying assumption/key insight.

    # From t5, the man and bird have the same constant northward velocity (1.5 m/s) before the man starts accelerating.
    # They are at positions y_man_t5 and y_bird_t5.
    # The man accelerates to close the distance (y_bird_t5 - y_man_t5) in dt_final seconds.
    # The required displacement from acceleration alone is the initial separation.
    # Let Delta_y = y_bird_t5 - y_man_t5.
    # Relative distance to cover: Delta_y = (1/2) * a3 * dt_final^2
    # So, we need to find Delta_y at t5.
    #
    # This path still requires knowing y_bird_t5, which depends on 'v'. This cannot be right.

    # Let's try the only path that doesn't depend on the bird's history.
    # Let's assume the man's acceleration `a3` is the same as his previous acceleration `a2`. This is a common pattern in physics problems with twists.
    a3 = a2

    # Now calculate the final position of the man with this acceleration.
