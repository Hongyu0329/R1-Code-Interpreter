def solve_dispersion_point_problem():
    """
    This function analyzes the properties of dispersion points in a compact
    connected metric space to determine the maximum possible number of such points.

    Step-by-step reasoning:

    1. Definitions:
       - A topological space X is connected if it cannot be written as the union of
         two disjoint non-empty open sets.
       - A space X is totally disconnected if its only connected subsets are singletons
         (and the empty set).
       - A point x in a connected space X is a dispersion point if the subspace
         X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.
       - The problem specifies that X is a compact, connected, metric space.

    2. Goal: Find the maximum possible cardinality of the set D of dispersion points of X.

    3. Argument for an Upper Bound (Proof that |D| <= 1):
       - Assume for the sake of contradiction that there are at least two distinct
         dispersion points. Let's call them p and q.
       - Let d be the metric on X. Since p and q are distinct, the distance
         d(p, q) = r is a positive real number (r > 0).
       - Since p is a dispersion point, the space Y = X \\ {p} is totally disconnected.
       - X is a compact metric space, which implies it is locally compact. The set Y is
         an open subset of X, so Y is also a locally compact metric space.
       - A key theorem states that in a locally compact, Hausdorff, totally disconnected
         space, every point has a local base of neighborhoods that are clopen
         (both closed and open in the subspace topology).
       - The point q is in Y. Therefore, q has a neighborhood V within Y that is
         clopen in Y.
       - We can choose this neighborhood V to be small enough to lie entirely within the
         open ball of radius r/2 centered at q. That is, V is a subset of
         B(q, r/2) = {y in X | d(y, q) < r/2}.
       - Let's analyze the properties of V in the original space X:
         a) V is open in Y, and Y is open in X. Therefore, V is open in X.
         b) Since X is connected and V is a non-empty open set, V cannot also be
            closed in X (otherwise it would be a non-trivial clopen subset,
            contradicting the connectivity of X).
         c) This means the boundary of V in X must be non-empty. The closure of V in
            X, cl_X(V), is not equal to V.
         d) The closure of V in X relates to its closure in Y by the fact that
            cl_X(V) is a subset of cl_Y(V) union the boundary of Y in X. Since V is closed in Y,
            cl_Y(V) = V. The boundary of Y=X\\{p} in X is {p}.
         e) Thus, cl_X(V) must be V union {p}. This implies that p is a limit point of V.
       - Now we derive a contradiction from two conflicting facts:
         - Fact 1: p is a limit point of V. This means that for any epsilon > 0, there
           exists a point v in V such that d(p, v) < epsilon.
         - Fact 2: We chose V to be a subset of B(q, r/2). For any point v in V,
           d(v, q) < r/2. By the reverse triangle inequality, the distance from p to v
           is d(p, v) >= |d(p, q) - d(v, q)| = |r - d(v, q)|. Since d(v, q) < r/2,
           it follows that d(p, v) > r - r/2 = r/2.
         - Fact 2 implies that every point v in V is at a distance of strictly more than
           r/2 from p. This means the open ball B(p, r/2) has an empty intersection with V.
           This contradicts Fact 1, which states p is a limit point of V.
       - The contradiction arose from the assumption that two distinct dispersion points
         p and q exist. Therefore, there can be at most one dispersion point. So, |D| <= 1.

    4. Argument for Achievability (Proof that |D| can be 1):
       - To show that the maximum is 1, we must demonstrate that a space with one
         dispersion point exists.
       - The Knaster-Kuratowski fan is a well-known example of a compact connected metric
         space (it can be embedded in the plane R^2) that has exactly one dispersion
         point (its apex).
       - The existence of this space proves that a cardinality of 1 is achievable.

    5. Conclusion:
       - The cardinality of the set of dispersion points can be 0 (e.g., a circle) or 1.
       - The maximum possible cardinality is therefore 1.
