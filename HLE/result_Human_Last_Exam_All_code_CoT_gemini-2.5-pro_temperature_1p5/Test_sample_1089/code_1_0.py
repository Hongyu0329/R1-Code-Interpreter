    # Rationale: The term "build-up of layers" strongly implies restoring material
    # lost from a surface due to wear. Blade tip rub is a classic example of this,
    # where the blade tip loses material from contact with the engine's casing.
    # TIG welding is the standard method to add material back to the tip, which is
    # then re-profiled. While other damage types might be weld-repaired, this
    # description is most characteristic of tip wear repair.
