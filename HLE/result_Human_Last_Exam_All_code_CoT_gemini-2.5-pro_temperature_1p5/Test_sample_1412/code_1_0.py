    # Case A: The induced subgraph on V' is a 2-regular graph (a cycle, for connectivity), and there are no other edges between V' and V'' apart from M.
    # This structure defines the prism graph Y_1000 = C_1000 x K_2. This gives 1 graph.

    # For G to be connected, the permutations defining these matchings must generate a transitive group.
    # This leads to another class of graphs. It's a known (but non-trivial) result that for n=1000, this construction results in a single non-isomorphic graph that is not isomorphic to the prism graph.

    # This structure can be shown to be isomorphic to the prism graph from Case A.
