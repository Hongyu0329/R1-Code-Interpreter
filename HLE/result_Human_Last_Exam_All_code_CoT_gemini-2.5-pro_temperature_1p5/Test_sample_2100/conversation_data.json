    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  I will first analyze the clues given in the text. The key phrases are \"Andrei Voznesensky,\" \"a joy-discovering sailor,\" \"Where is your grave,\" and the grave's discovery \"in the late 1980s.\"\n2.  The poet Andrei Voznesensky famously wrote the libretto for the Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n3.  This opera is based on the life of the Russian explorer and nobleman Nikolai Rezanov. He can be described as a \"sailor\" or explorer.\n4.  Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, in 1807. His original grave was destroyed by the Soviets, and its location became a mystery until it was rediscovered in the late 20th century, which aligns with the \"late 1980s\" clue.\n5.  Therefore, the man is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n6.  I will write a Python script to print the last name.\n\n```python\n# The individual described in the riddle is Nikolai Rezanov.\n# 1. The poet Andrei Voznesensky wrote the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which tells Rezanov's story.\n# 2. Rezanov was a Russian diplomat and explorer, fitting the description of \"a joy-discovering sailor.\"\n# 3. His original gravesite in Krasnoyarsk was lost and then rediscovered in the late 20th century, matching the clues.\n\n# The man's last name is Rezanov.\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\nprint(last_name)\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
