    This function analyzes the behavioral patterns to determine which has the

    # --- Step 1: Define what benefits the plant ---
    # Plant fitness for milkweed is primarily driven by successful pollination.
    # Pollination requires physical contact between the insect and the flower.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the given behaviors from the ethogram ---
    # 1) investigation start, 2) investigation end: Non-contact. No pollination.
    # 3) interaction start, 4) interaction end: Contact. Pollination can occur.
    # 5) feeding start, 6) feeding end: A type of contact. High chance of pollination.

    # We represent durations and frequencies for clarity.
    # duration_investigation = time(2) - time(1)
    # duration_interaction = time(4) - time(3)
    # duration_feeding = time(6) - time(5)
    # freq_investigation = n(1)/hour
    # freq_interaction = n(3)/hour
    # freq_feeding = n(5)/hour

    # --- Step 3: Evaluate each choice ---

    print("Analyzing the behavioral patterns:")

    # Choice A: 4-3 >> 6-5 (duration_interaction >> duration_feeding)
    print("A. 4-3 >> 6-5: Duration of interaction is much greater than duration of feeding.")
    print("   - Meaning: The insect spends a lot of time touching the flower, but not necessarily feeding.")
    print("   - Effect: This is good for pollination, as any contact can be effective. This is a plausible positive trait.")

    # Choice B: 6-5 >> 4-3 (duration_feeding >> duration_interaction)
    print("B. 6-5 >> 4-3: Duration of feeding is much greater than duration of interaction.")
    print("   - Meaning: This is logically impossible. Feeding is a subset of interaction, so its duration cannot be greater.")
    print("   - Effect: Invalid pattern.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Choice C: 4-3 >> 2-1 (duration_interaction >> duration_investigation)
    print("C. 4-3 >> 2-1: Duration of interaction is much greater than duration of investigation.")
    print("   - Meaning: The insect spends the vast majority of its visit time in physical contact with the flower, rather than flying around it.")
    print("   - Effect: This behavior maximizes the opportunity for pollen transfer per visit, making the insect a highly efficient pollinator. This has a very strong positive effect on plant fitness.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Choice D: n(5)/hour >> n(3)/hour (freq_feeding >> freq_interaction)
    print("D. n(5)/hour >> n(3)/hour: The number of feeding events is much greater than the number of interaction events.")
    print("   - Meaning: Impossible. Every feeding event requires an interaction event to have started.")
    print("   - Effect: Invalid pattern.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Choice E: n(1)/hour >> n(3)/hour (freq_investigation >> freq_interaction)
    print("E. n(1)/hour >> n(3)/hour: The number of investigations is much greater than the number of interactions.")
    print("   - Meaning: The insect frequently approaches the flower but rarely lands to make contact.")
    print("   - Effect: This would be a very poor pollinator, having a minimal or negative effect on fitness.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Choice F: n(3)/hour >> n(1)/hour (freq_interaction >> freq_investigation)
    print("F. n(3)/hour >> n(1)/hour: The number of interactions is much greater than the number of investigations.")
    print("   - Meaning: Impossible. An investigation (approach) must precede an interaction (contact).")
    print("   - Effect: Invalid pattern.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # --- Step 4: Final Conclusion ---
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Choices B, D, and F are logically impossible. Choice E describes a poor pollinator.")
    print("The best pattern is between A and C. Choice C (4-3 >> 2-1) describes an efficient pollinator that maximizes contact time relative to non-contact time.")
    print("This maximization of contact time is the most fundamental trait for a successful pollinator, leading to the greatest positive effect on plant fitness.")
