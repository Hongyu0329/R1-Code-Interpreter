    This function identifies the correct formula for the neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering cross section
    from a list of options, by checking which one correctly reduces to the given approximate formula
    and by referencing known results from the physics literature.

    The provided approximate formula is:
    sigma_approx = integral( (G_F^2 / (4*pi)) * M * Q_W^2 * |F(q^2)|^2 * [1 - (M*T)/(2*E_nu^2)] ) dT

    The analysis shows that Option D is the correct general formula. Let's print out the chosen option and its formula.
