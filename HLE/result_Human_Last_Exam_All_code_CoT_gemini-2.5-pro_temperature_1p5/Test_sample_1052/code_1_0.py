def solve():

    This function prints the derived Boolean formula.
    The problem is to find a Boolean formula from which the polynomial 
    ((((d ⊕ c) ⊕ (b ∧ c)) ⊕ (a ∧ d)) ⊕ (a ∧ c)) ⊕ ((a ∧ (b ∧ d)) ⊕ (a ∧ (b ∧ c)))
    is derived, using only the operators (¬, ↑, ↓, ↔, →, ∨).

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  The polynomial is converted to its Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) by analyzing its structure.
        The equivalent DNF is: (b ∧ d) ∨ (¬a ∧ ¬b ∧ (c ⊕ d)).
    2.  This DNF is then transformed into an equivalent formula using only the allowed operators.
        - c ⊕ d is equivalent to ¬(c ↔ d).
        - Conjunctions (∧) are replaced using De Morgan's laws, e.g., A ∧ B = ¬(¬A ∨ ¬B).
    3.  This yields the final formula printed below.
