    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid:\n\n1.  **Research:** I will first research various academic and classical sources to compile a list of rivers mentioned by Virgil in the Aeneid.\n2.  **Gather Data:** For each river identified, I will find its approximate modern length in kilometers.\n3.  **Analyze and Rank:** I will then sort the rivers from this list by length in descending order.\n4.  **Code and Output:** Finally, I will write a Python script to store this data, perform the sorting, and print the names and lengths of the top three longest rivers.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n\n    The function stores a dictionary of major rivers mentioned in the text\n    and their approximate real-world lengths in kilometers. It then sorts\n    these rivers by length to find the top three.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approx. lengths (km).\n    # Sources for mentions include:\n    # Nile (Nilus): Aeneid, Book 8, line 711\n    # Danube (Ister): Aeneid, Book 8, line 727\n    # Euphrates: Aeneid, Book 8, line 726\n    # Rhine (Rhenus): Aeneid, Book 8, line 727\n    # Po (Eridanus): Aeneid, Book 6, line 659\n    # Tiber (Tiberis): Mentioned extensively in the second half of the epic.\n    \n    river_data = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Danube': 2850,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Rhine': 1230,\n        'Po': 652,\n        'Tiber': 406\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary items by length (the second element of the tuple) in descending order\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(river_data.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, based on their real-world lengths, are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {river} (Length: approximately {length} km)\")\n\nfind_longest_rivers_in_aeneid()\n```\n<<<Nile, Danube, Euphrates>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
