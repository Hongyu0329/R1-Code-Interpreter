    # The question asks for the spectral series expansion technique adapted for
    # poloidal dependence in toroidal systems.

    # Step 1: Understand the geometry. A toroidal system is donut-shaped.
    # The poloidal direction refers to the short circular path around the torus cross-section.
    # This path is described by a periodic angle, let's call it θ, from 0 to 2π.
    
    # Step 2: Understand the requirement. We need to represent a function that varies
    # with this periodic angle θ.
    
    # Step 3: Evaluate the mathematical tools. The Fourier series is a method to
    # represent a periodic function as a sum of sines and cosines. This is a perfect
    # fit for a function of a periodic angle.
    
    # Step 4: Conclude the best fit.
