    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square (Manhattan) lattice, starting from an origin. A self-avoiding walk is a path on the lattice that does not visit the same point more than once.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Method**: I will use a recursive backtracking algorithm (a form of depth-first search) to solve this problem. This method systematically explores all possible paths of length 10.\n2.  **State Representation**: The state of our search will be defined by the current path, which is a sequence of visited coordinates. To efficiently check for self-intersections, I'll use a `set` to store the coordinates already on the path.\n3.  **Recursive Function**: I will create a function, let's call it `count_walks`, that takes the current path and the set of visited points as input.\n4.  **Base Case**: The recursion stops when the path reaches the desired length of 10 steps (which means it contains 11 points, including the starting point). When this happens, we have found one valid walk, and the function returns 1.\n5.  **Recursive Step**: From the last point in the current path, the function will try to move in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n6.  **Constraint Check**: For each potential move, it checks if the new point is already in the `visited` set.\n7.  **Exploration**: If the new point has not been visited, the function will add it to the path and the visited set, and then make a recursive call to continue the walk.\n8.  **Backtracking**: After the recursive call returns, the function will remove the last point from the path and visited set. This \"backtracking\" step is crucial, as it allows the search to explore other alternative paths from the previous point.\n9.  **Summation**: The total number of walks is the sum of the results from all valid recursive calls.\n10. **Execution**: The process starts from the origin (0, 0) with an initial path containing just this point. The function will be called to find all valid walks of length 10.\n\nThis approach will systematically count every possible 10-step self-avoiding walk.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's good practice to increase the recursion limit for deep recursion,\n# though it may not be strictly necessary for N=10.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    This implementation uses a recursive backtracking approach.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of steps for the walk.\n    N = 10\n\n    def count_walks(path, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n        Args:\n            path (list): The list of (x, y) tuples representing the current path.\n            visited (set): A set of (x, y) tuples for O(1) checking of visited points.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # A walk of N steps has N+1 points.
