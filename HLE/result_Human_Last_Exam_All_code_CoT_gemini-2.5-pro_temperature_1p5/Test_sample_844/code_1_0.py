    print("C. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")

    print("   Analysis: NOT TRUE. This statement provides an unsupported reason for the outcome. The text never mentions glucose levels in cotton. The most logical reason for decreased galactosidase activity is the lack of its substrate (raffinose), as stated in C. Claiming the cause is 'owing to higher glucose levels' is an unsubstantiated leap in logic.")

    print("   Analysis: True. When the MA aphid moves to watermelon (inferred to be high-raffinose), it is exposed to a new substrate. A common biological response ('differential effect') is the induction (increase) of the relevant enzyme (galactosidase) to try and metabolize the new food source.")
