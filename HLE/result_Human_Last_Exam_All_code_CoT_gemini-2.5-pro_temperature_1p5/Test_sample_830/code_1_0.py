# Plan: The problem asks for the value of a specific limit involving the Euler phi function in a function ring.
# This limit is a known result in analytic number theory for function fields, analogous to Mertens' theorems for integers.
# The value is given by C * e^(-gamma), where gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant and C is a constant that depends on the field.
# The phrasing of the problem points towards the rational function field case (g=0, h=1), for which C=1.
# Therefore, the value of the limit is e^(-gamma).
# This script will calculate this value and, as requested, output the numbers in the final equation.

# The final equation for the limit is e^(-gamma).
# The numbers in this equation are Euler's number 'e' and the Euler-Mascheroni constant 'gamma'.
