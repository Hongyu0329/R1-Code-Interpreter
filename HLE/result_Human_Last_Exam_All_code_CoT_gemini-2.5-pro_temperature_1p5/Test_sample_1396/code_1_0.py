# The problem is to find the most realistic upper bound O for a connected
# epsilon-envy-free cake-cutting allocation among four agents.

# Based on the 2022 paper "The Query Complexity of Cake Cutting" by
# Simina Brânzei and Noam Nisan, a protocol was developed for an exact
# connected envy-free allocation for 4 agents. An exact protocol's complexity
# provides an upper bound for an epsilon-envy-free version.

# The paper provides an overestimate for the total number of cuts required by their protocol.
# This constant is the tightest known upper bound.
O = 203

# The "equation" is the assignment of this research-derived constant.
# We will print the components of this simple assignment.
print(f"Let O be the upper bound.")
print(f"Based on the work of Brânzei and Nisan (2022), the most realistic upper bound is a constant number of cuts.")
print(f"The final equation is:")
print(f"O = {O}")
