1.  The question is about why a duplicated gene is kept (retention) and how it changes (divergence).

2.  Pseudogenization (B) is the loss of the gene, not retention. Gene conversion (A) prevents divergence. Adaptive radiation (E) is a macro-evolutionary pattern, not a mechanism at the gene level. This leaves (C) and (D).

3.  Neofunctionalization (C) is when one copy gains a new function. This is a valid mechanism for retention and divergence.

4.  Subfunctionalization (D) is when the original gene's functions are split between the two new copies. Both copies are then required, ensuring their retention. This also explains divergence as they specialize.

5.  Comparing (C) and (D): Subfunctionalization provides a more immediate path to retention. It relies on common loss-of-function mutations to make both copies essential. Neofunctionalization requires a rarer gain-of-function mutation to occur before the redundant gene is lost. Therefore, subfunctionalization is considered a highly likely and frequent mechanism for preserving gene duplicates.
