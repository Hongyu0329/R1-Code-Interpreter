    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth by percentage, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Noble Gases**: List the naturally occurring noble gases: Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon.\n2.  **Gather Abundance Data**: Find the abundance of each gas. The most common and standardized measure for these gases is their concentration in the Earth's atmosphere, which serves as a reliable proxy for their overall rarity in \"terrestrial matter.\" The relative abundances have not changed meaningfully since 2002.\n3.  **Compare Percentages**: I will use a Python script to store these abundances as percentages and programmatically find the gas with the smallest percentage.\n4.  **Display the Result**: The script will print the name of the rarest gas and its minuscule percentage.\n\nThe Python script below will define the abundances and identify the minimum value.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth based on its\n    atmospheric abundance, which is a proxy for its percentage in all terrestrial matter.\n    The data is valid for 2002 as these concentrations are stable over long periods.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Abundances of noble gases in Earth's atmosphere by percentage.\n    # Sources: NASA, CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.\n    # Radon's abundance is exceptionally low due to its radioactivity and short half-life.\n    noble_gas_percentages = {\n        'Helium': 5.24e-4,      # 0.000524%\n        'Neon': 1.818e-3,       # 0.001818%\n        'Argon': 0.934,         # 0.934%\n        'Krypton': 1.14e-4,     # 0.000114%\n        'Xenon': 8.7e-6,        # 0.0000087%\n        'Radon': 1e-19          # ~0.0000000000000000001%\n    }\n\n    # Find the gas with the minimum percentage\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_percentages, key=noble_gas_percentages.get)\n    rarest_gas_percentage = noble_gas_percentages[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    print(\"Comparison of Noble Gas Abundances (as percentage in atmosphere):\")\n    for gas, percentage in noble_gas_percentages.items():\n        print(f\"- {gas}: {percentage}%\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    # The final \"equation\" is the statement identifying the rarest gas and its value.\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas is {rarest_gas_name} with an abundance of approximately {rarest_gas_percentage}%.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
