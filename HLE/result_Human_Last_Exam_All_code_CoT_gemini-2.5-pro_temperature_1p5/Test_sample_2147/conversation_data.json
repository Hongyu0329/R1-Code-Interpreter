    "Pavel Milyukov, a key political figure in early 20th century Russia, was known for his conservative cultural views. He was a staunch critic of the modern art movements that were emerging from Western Europe and gaining traction among the Russian avant-garde. I will provide a python script that reveals the term he famously derided.\n\n```python\n# Pavel Milyukov was a critic of modernist art.\n# He used the phrase 'stagnant swamp' to attack a particular artistic movement\n# that followed Impressionism and included artists like CÃ©zanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin.\n\n# The term is composed of two parts, which we'll call X and Y.\nX = \"Post\"\nY = \"Impressionists\"\n\n# The script will now print the full term.\nprint(f\"The term X-Y that Pavel Milyukov denounced is: {X}-{Y}\")\n```\n<<<Post-Impressionists>>>"
