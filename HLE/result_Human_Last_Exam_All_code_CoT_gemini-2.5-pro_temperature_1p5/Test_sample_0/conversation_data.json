    "Critical-level views in population ethics evaluate the goodness of a population by summing the welfare of each individual after subtracting a positive \"critical level\" `c`. The value of a population of size `n` with uniform welfare `w` is `n * (w - c)`. A life is only considered a positive addition if its welfare `w` is greater than the critical level `c`.\n\nThe condition these views violate is **Non-Elitism**. Non-Elitism states that for any high welfare level `w1`, you can always find a sufficiently large number of people `n` at a slightly lower welfare level `w2` whose existence is at least as good as the existence of one person at `w1`.\n\nThis leads to a violation when we choose a high welfare level `w1` that is *above* the critical level `c`, and a lower welfare level `w2` that is *below* `c` (but still positive).\n*   The value of one person at `w1` is `1 * (w1 - c)`, which is a positive number.\n*   The value of `n` people at `w2` is `n * (w2 - c)`, which is a negative number for any `n > 0`.\n\nA negative value can never be greater than or equal to a positive value, no matter how large `n` becomes. Therefore, the condition of Non-Elitism is violated.\n\nThe following Python script demonstrates this failure.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef critical_level_value(n, w, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of a population using a critical-level view.\n    Value = n * (w - c)\n    n: number of people\n    w: welfare level of each person\n    c: the critical level\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * (w - c)\n\ndef demonstrate_non_elitism_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates how critical-level views violate Non-Elitism.\n    Non-Elitism: For any w1 > w2 > 0, there exists a number n such that\n                 a population of n people at w2 is at least as good as\n                 one person at w1.\n    Condition: value(n, w2, c) >= value(1, w1, c)\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Setup ---\n    # Define a critical level, c.\n    critical_level = 10.0\n\n    # Define a high welfare level (w1) above the critical level.\n    welfare_high = 20.0\n\n    # Define a lower positive welfare level (w2) below the critical level.\n    welfare_low = 5.0\n\n    print(\"Demonstrating the violation of Non-Elitism by Critical-Level Views.\")\n    print(f\"\\nParameters Used:\")\n    print(f\"  - Critical Level (c): {critical_level}\")\n    print(f\"  - High Welfare Level (w1): {welfare_high}\")\n    print(f\"  - Low Welfare Level (w2): {welfare_low}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Value of the High-Welfare Individual ---\n    # This value must be surpassed by a population at the low-welfare level.\n    value_high_welfare_person = critical_level_value(1, welfare_high, critical_level)\n    print(\"First, calculate the value of the one person at the high welfare level (w1).\")\n    print(f\"Equation: 1 * (w1 - c)\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: 1 * ({welfare_high} - {critical_level}) = {value_high_welfare_person}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Test if the Condition Can Be Met ---\n    print(\"Now, we check if any number of people 'n' at the low welfare level (w2)\")\n    print(\"can have a total value greater than or equal to this.\")\n    print(f\"Condition to satisfy: n * (w2 - c) >= {value_high_welfare_person}\")\n    low_welfare_factor = welfare_low - critical_level\n    print(f\"Substituting values: n * ({welfare_low} - {critical_level}) >= {value_high_welfare_person}\")\n    print(f\"Simplified: n * ({low_welfare_factor}) >= {value_high_welfare_person}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Since w2 is less than c, the term (w2 - c) is negative.\")\n    print(\"A positive number 'n' multiplied by a negative number will always be negative.\")\n    print(\"A negative result can never be greater than or equal to a positive one.\")\n    print(\"Let's test a few large values of 'n':\\n\")\n\n    for n in [1, 100, 10000, 1000000]:\n        value_low_welfare_pop = critical_level_value(n, welfare_low, critical_level)\n        is_met = value_low_welfare_pop >= value_high_welfare_person\n        print(f\"--- For n = {n:,} ---\")\n        print(f\"Equation: {n} * ({welfare_low} - {critical_level}) = {value_low_welfare_pop:,.1f}\")\n        print(f\"Is {value_low_welfare_pop:,.1f} >= {value_high_welfare_person}?
