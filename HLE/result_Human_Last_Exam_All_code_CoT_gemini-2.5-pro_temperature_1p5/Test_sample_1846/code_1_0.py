    print("1. In the KEYNOTE-355 trial, the combination of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab with chemotherapy was compared to chemotherapy alone.")
    print("2. A statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival was demonstrated for the group of patients whose tumors were PD-L1-positive (specifically, a Combined Positive Score [CPS] of 10 or more).")
    print("3. This significant benefit in overall survival was not observed in the broader intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which includes both PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients.")
    print("4. Patients in the PD-L1-negative population did not show a significant survival benefit from the addition of the PD-1 inhibitor.")
    print("\nTherefore, the addition of PD-1 inhibitors to chemotherapy provides a prolonged overall survival benefit specifically for the PD-L1-positive population.")
