    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we can follow this plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Encoding Principle:** For a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits it can robustly store is determined by its topology. Specifically, each \"hole\" or large defect created within the code's lattice structure can encode one logical qubit.\n\n2.  **Calculate Qubits per Patch:** The problem states that each patch of the surface code has two holes. Therefore, a single patch can encode 2 logical qubits.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Qubits:** Since there are two separate and identical patches of the surface code, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the qubits that each patch can encode.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of separate surface code patches\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# Number of holes created in each patch\nholes_per_patch = 2\n\n# For a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of holes.\n# Therefore, the number of qubits for a single patch is:\nqubits_per_patch = holes_per_patch\n\n# The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from all separate patches.\ntotal_logical_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n\nprint(f\"Each of the {num_patches} patches has {holes_per_patch} holes, allowing each to encode {qubits_per_patch} logical qubits.\")\nprint(\"The total number of logical qubits is the sum from both patches.\")\nprint(f\"Total logical qubits = {qubits_per_patch} + {qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
