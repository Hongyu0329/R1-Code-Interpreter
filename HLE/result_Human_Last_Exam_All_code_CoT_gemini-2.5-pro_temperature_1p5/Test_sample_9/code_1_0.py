    # Step 1: Identify the space X.
    # X is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.
    # This space can be described as the quotient X = SL_pm(2, R) / GL(2, Z).
    # where SL_pm(2, R) is the set of real 2x2 matrices with determinant +/- 1,
    # and GL(2, Z) is the modular group.

    # Step 2: Use a standard topological model for X.
    # The space X is known to be homeomorphic to the orbifold H / PGL(2, Z),
    # where H is the upper half-plane and PGL(2, Z) is the modular group
    # acting on it.

    # Step 3: Analyze the topology of the model.
    # The topological space underlying the orbifold H / PGL(2, Z) is
    # homeomorphic to an open disk, which is homeomorphic to R^2.

    # Step 4: Compute the first homology group based on the topology.
    # The singular homology groups of a contractible space are trivial for n > 0.
    # We are interested in H_1(X, Z).
    if is_contractible:
        h1_group = 0  # The trivial group is denoted by 0.

    # The final equation is H_1(X, Z) = 0.
    # We will print the number in this equation.
