    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I will factor the term inside the product, $1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3}$, into a product of three factors using the complex cube roots of unity.\n2.  Next, I will use a well-known identity that connects an infinite product to the Gamma function. This identity, a generalization of the sine product formula, states that $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega^2)}$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity.\n3.  The given product starts from $n=3$, not $n=1$. To account for this, I will adjust the formula by dividing the result for the product from $n=1$ by the first two terms of the product (i.e., the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$).\n4.  Finally, I will construct a Python script that will print out the final derived formula. The script will explicitly define the numbers involved in the formula to satisfy the problem's constraints.\n\nHere is the Python code to generate the solution:\n\n```python\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the symbolic solution for the infinite product\n    product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3 / n^3)\n    by printing the final formula as a string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # These are the numbers that appear in the original problem statement.\n    start_index = 3\n    power = 3\n\n    # The formula for the infinite product from n=1 is based on the Gamma function.\n    # Product_{n=1 to infinity} (1 - z^3 / n^3) = 1 / (Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1-z*w) * Gamma(1-z*w^2))\n    # where w = exp(2*pi*i/3) is a primitive cube root of unity.\n\n    # To get the product from n=3, we must divide by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n    n_term_1 = 1\n    n_term_2 = 2\n\n    # These are the numbers that appear in the terms we divide by.\n    term1_numerator_z_power = 3\n    term1_denominator_n = 1\n    term1_denominator_n_power = 3\n\n    term2_numerator_z_power = 3\n    term2_denominator_n = 2\n    term2_denominator_n_power = 3\n\n    # These are the numbers in the arguments of the Gamma functions.\n    gamma_arg_const_1 = 1\n    gamma_arg_const_2 = 1 # for z*w^1\n    gamma_arg_const_3 = 2 # for z*w^2\n\n    # These are the numbers defining the cube root of unity, w = exp(2*pi*i/3).\n    omega_numerator_pi_coeff = 2\n    omega_denominator = 3\n    \n    # Constructing the final equation string using the numbers defined above.\n    equation = (\n        f\"product_{{n={start_index}}} ^ infinity (1 - z^{power} / n^{power}) = \\n\\n\"\n        f\"1 / ( (1 - z^{term1_numerator_z_power}/{term1_denominator_n}^{term1_denominator_n_power}) * \"\n        f\"(1 - z^{term2_numerator_z_power}/{term2_denominator_n}^{term2_denominator_n_power}) * \"\n        f\"Gamma({gamma_arg_const_1}-z) * \"\n        f\"Gamma({gamma_arg_const_1}-z*exp({omega_numerator_pi_coeff}*pi*i/{omega_denominator})) * \"\n        f\"Gamma({gamma_arg_const_1}-z*exp({gamma_arg_const_3}*{omega_numerator_pi_coeff}*pi*i/{omega_denominator})) )\"\n    )\n\n    print(\"The final formula for the infinite product is:\")\n    print(equation)\n    \n    # For clarity, let's simplify the terms we divide by and the exponents in omega\n    simplified_equation = (\n        f\"\\nOr, in a more simplified form:\\n\\n\"\n        f\"1 / ( (1 - z^3) * (1 - z^3/8) * \"\n        f\"Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1-z*exp(2*pi*i/3)) * Gamma(1-z*exp(4*pi*i/3)) )\"\n    )\n    print(simplified_equation)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_infinite_product()\n\n```\n<<<$1 / ((1 - z^3)*(1 - z^3/8)*Gamma(1-z)*Gamma(1-z*exp(2*pi*i/3))*Gamma(1-z*exp(4*pi*i/3)))$>>>"
