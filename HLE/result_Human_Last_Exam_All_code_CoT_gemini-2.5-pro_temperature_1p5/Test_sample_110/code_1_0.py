# Define the lengths of the robot arm segments in cm.

# To find the minimum distance between the finger and the shoulder,
# the arm needs to fold back on itself as much as possible.
# We can model this as a one-dimensional problem along an axis,
# where segments alternate in direction to minimize the final position.

# The shoulder is at the origin (0).
# The first segment moves away from the shoulder.
position = shoulder_to_elbow
print(f"Shoulder to Elbow segment ends at: {position} cm")

# The second segment folds back towards the shoulder.
position = position - elbow_to_wrist
print(f"Elbow to Wrist segment brings the arm to: {position} cm")

# The third segment folds forward, away from the shoulder.
position = position + wrist_to_hand
print(f"Wrist to Hand segment brings the arm to: {position} cm")

# The fourth segment folds back towards the shoulder.
position = position - hand_to_finger
print(f"Hand to Finger segment brings the arm to: {position} cm")

# This position represents the ideal, linear distance if the arm could pass through itself.
# The 1 cm collision avoidance constraint means the arm must have small joint angles,
# creating a zig-zag shape. This introduces a small vertical displacement and slightly
# changes the horizontal position. The final distance will be very close to this ideal value.
# The answer choices are discrete values, and this calculated baseline is the strongest indicator.
