def solve_continuum_problem():

    This function solves the mathematical problem posed.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection
    of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

    Step 1: Lower Bound Proof
    A decomposable continuum X = A U B always has at least two disjoint
    non-empty open sets, X\A and X\B. The closures of the components
    of these open sets form distinct regular proper subcontinua.
    This proves the cardinality is at least 2.

    Step 2: Existence Proof
    An example can be constructed to show that a cardinality of 2 is achievable.
    A well-known example is derived from the "Lakes of Wada" construction,
    where a continuum is formed by the union of two open "lakes" and their
    shared, common boundary. This construction yields exactly two
    regular proper subcontinua.

    Conclusion:
    The smallest possible cardinality is the combination of the lower bound
    and the existence proof.
