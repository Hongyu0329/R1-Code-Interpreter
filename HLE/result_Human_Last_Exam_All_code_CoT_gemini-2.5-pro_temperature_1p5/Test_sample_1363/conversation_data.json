    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The user wants to know in which ballroom dance it is technically impossible to \"overturn\" a reverse turn. A reverse turn is a left-turning figure. \"Overturning\" means adding more rotation than is standard for the figure. The key constraint is \"without disregarding the technique.\"\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Dance Techniques:**\n    *   **Swing Dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These dances are characterized by rise and fall, body sway, and Contrary Body Movement (CBM). These elements create a flowing, continuous rotation. While a standard reverse turn has a prescribed amount of turn, the underlying technique allows for blending figures and adding rotation. So, overturning is technically *possible*, even if it creates a non-standard variation.\n    *   **Viennese Waltz:** This dance is defined by continuous rotation. The concept of overturning a single, isolated turn doesn't apply in the same way, as each turn flows into the next.\n    *   **European Tango:** This dance is the outlier. Its technique is fundamentally different and is defined by what it *lacks*:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** It's a flat, grounded dance.\n        *   **No Body Sway:** The posture is strong and upright.\n        *   **No CBM for Rotation:** Turns are sharp and staccato, executed as pivots or swivels, not through a gradual, swinging body rotation.\n        *   To \"overturn\" a turn means to add more continuous, swinging rotation. Doing this in Tango would require introducing sway, CBM, and a flowing quality, which are the exact opposite of proper Tango technique. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango reverse turn without completely disregarding its fundamental technical principles.\n\n3.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that models this logic. It will assign a \"Technical Conflict Score\" to each dance. The higher the score, the more an overturn conflicts with the dance's core technique. The script will print out this evaluation, making it clear why Tango is the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballroom dance techniques to determine where overturning a reverse turn is impossible.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    dances = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrot',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    # Technical principles that allow for rotational flexibility (Swing, CBM, Rise & Fall).\n    # A score of 1 means the principle is key to the dance's rotation.\n    # A score of 0 means the principle is absent or contradictory to the technique.\n    technical_properties = {\n        'Viennese Waltz': {'Swing': 1, 'CBM': 1, 'Rise & Fall': 1},\n        'English Waltz':   {'Swing': 1, 'CBM': 1, 'Rise & Fall': 1},\n        'European Tango':  {'Swing': 0, 'CBM': 0, 'Rise & Fall': 0},\n        'Slow Foxtrot':  {'Swing': 1, 'CBM': 1, 'Rise & Fall': 1},\n        'Quickstep':       {'Swing': 1, 'CBM': 1, 'Rise & Fall': 1}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Evaluating the impossibility of overturning a reverse turn based on core techniques.\")\n    print(\"A 'Flexibility Score' is calculated for each dance.
