    "To determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we can analyze its topological structure. The provided field is a classic example of an axisymmetric hopfion. The Hopf charge, a topological invariant, can be calculated for such a field using a simplified method instead of the full Whitehead integral formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the structure**: The vector field is given in a form `n = (sin(G)cos(f), sin(G)sin(f), cos(G))`, where `f` is the azimuthal (toroidal) angle and `G` is a profile function that depends on the poloidal coordinates (distance from the z-axis `ρ` and height `z`).\n2.  **Decompose the Hopf charge**: For this structure, the Hopf charge `H` is the product of two integer winding numbers: the toroidal winding number `k` and the poloidal winding number `P`. The formula is `H = k * P`.\n3.  **Determine the toroidal winding number (k)**: The angle `f` is given by `atan2(y,x)`, which corresponds to the standard azimuthal angle. The field winds exactly once around the z-axis as you make a full circle in the xy-plane. Thus, `k = 1`.\n4.  **Determine the poloidal winding number (P)**: The winding number `P` is determined by the range of the profile function `G`. The formula is `P = (G_boundary - G_core) / π`.\n    *   `G_boundary` is the value of `G` at the spatial boundary (infinity). As `(x,y,z) → ∞`, `r2 → ∞`, and `G = π * exp(-10*r2) → 0`.\n    *   `G_core` is the value of `G` at the center or \"core\" of the structure. This occurs where `r2` is minimized. The minimum value of `r2` is `0`, which happens on the circle defined by `z=0` and `x² + y² = 0.5`. At this core, `G = π * exp(0) = π`.\n5.  **Calculate H**: Substitute the values of `k` and `P` into the formula `H = k * P` to get the final Hopf charge.\n\nThe following Python script implements this analytical calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge for the given vector field based on its topological structure.\n    The Hopf Charge H is the product of the toroidal (k) and poloidal (P) winding numbers.\n    H = k * P\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
