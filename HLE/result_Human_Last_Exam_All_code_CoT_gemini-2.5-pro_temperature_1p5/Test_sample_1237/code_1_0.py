# Define the given constants from the problem
w12 = 100000

# The constant w13 is not needed for the calculation based on our analysis.

# We need the value of tanh(1)
tanh_1 = np.tanh(1)

# The expression to be calculated is derived from the branching equations.
# The term (tanh(c1)/tanh(c2) - 1) is found to be 2 / (w12 * tanh(1)).
# The final expression is 1000 * (2 / (w12 * tanh(1)))**2.

# Let's define the components of the final formula
numerator = 4000
w12_squared = w12**2
tanh_1_squared = tanh_1**2

# Calculate the final result
result = numerator / (w12_squared * tanh_1_squared)

# As requested, output the numbers in the final equation.
