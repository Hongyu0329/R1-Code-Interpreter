    "The task is to identify the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization and present this information using a Python script.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Research the earliest recorded dates in pre-Columbian writing systems. The main contenders are from the Maya and Zapotec civilizations, often recorded using the Long Count calendar or the 260-day sacred calendar (Tzolk'in).\n2.  Identify the specific artifact that holds the record. Key artifacts include Tres Zapotes Stela C, Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, and recent discoveries at the San Bartolo archaeological site in Guatemala.\n3.  Recent archaeological findings (announced in 2022) at San Bartolo have uncovered painted fragments showing a glyph for \"7 Deer\". Radiocarbon dating places these fragments between 300 and 200 BC. This predates the previously known earliest Long Count dates.\n4.  The script will store the information about this discoveryâ€”the artifact, its location, the civilization, the recorded date, and its approximate equivalent in the Gregorian calendar.\n5.  The script will then print this information in a clear, narrative format.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents information about the earliest known date recorded\n    by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system.\n    \"\"\"\n    civilization = \"Maya\"\n    site = \"San Bartolo, Guatemala\"\n    date_notation = \"7 Deer\"\n    calendar_system = \"260-day Tzolk'in (sacred calendar)\"\n    approximate_date = \"c. 250 BC\"\n    context = (\n        \"This discovery, announced in April 2022, was made on painted plaster \"\n        \"fragments from the Las Pinturas pyramid at the San Bartolo archaeological site. \"\n        \"Radiocarbon dating of the charcoal associated with the fragments places them \"\n        \"to between 300 and 200 BC, making the '7 Deer' notation the earliest \"\n        \"secure evidence of a calendar being recorded in the Maya region.\"\n    )\n\n    # For context, this discovery predates the earliest known Long Count date.\n    previous_record_holder = \"Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2\"\n    previous_record_date_long_count = \"7.16.3.2.13\"\n    previous_record_date_gregorian = \"December 10, 36 BC\"\n\n    print(\"--- Earliest Known Pre-Columbian Recorded Date ---\")\n    print(f\"Civilization: {civilization}\")\n    print(f\"Archaeological Site: {site}\")\n    print(f\"Recorded Date Notation: '{date_notation}'\")\n    print(f\"Calendar System: {calendar_system}\")\n    print(f\"Approximate Gregorian Date: {approximate_date}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nContext:\")\n    print(textwrap.fill(context, 70))\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Previous Record Holder (Earliest Long Count Date) ---\")\n    print(f\"Artifact: {previous_record_holder}\")\n    print(f\"Mayan Long Count Date: {previous_record_date_long_count}\")\n    print(f\"Equivalent Gregorian Date: {previous_record_date_gregorian}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_earliest_date()\n\n```\n<<<A glyph representing \"7 Deer\", found on a mural fragment at San Bartolo, Guatemala, dating to approximately 250 BC.>>>"
