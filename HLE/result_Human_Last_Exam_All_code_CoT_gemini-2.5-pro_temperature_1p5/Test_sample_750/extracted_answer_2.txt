The solutions to the equation $z\cdot i=i^z$ are:
1.  Two real solutions: $z = 1$ and $z = -1$.
2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions given by the formula:
    $z_m = -i \frac{W(2\pi m - \frac{\pi}{2})}{2\pi m - \frac{\pi}{2}}$
    for all positive integers $m=1, 2, 3, \ldots$, where $W$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
