    "My approach to solving the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ is to substitute $z = x+iy$ and analyze the resulting system of equations for the real and imaginary parts of $z$.\n\n1.  **Set up the equation**: The equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$. We let $z = x+iy$. The term $i^z$ can be rewritten using the identity $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$. The natural logarithm of $i$ is multi-valued: $\\ln(i) = \\ln|i| + i \\arg(i) = 0 + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$. Let's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. The equation becomes:\n    $(x+iy)i = e^{(x+iy)iC_k}$\n    $-y + ix = e^{-yC_k}e^{ixC_k}$\n    $-y + ix = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$\n\n2.  **Equate Real and Imaginary Parts**: This gives a system of two equations:\n    *   Real part: $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n    *   Imaginary part: $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\n3.  **Solve for Real Solutions ($y=0$)**:\n    *   The first equation becomes $0 = \\cos(xC_k)$, which implies $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. This makes $\\sin(xC_k) = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The second equation becomes $x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n    *   Combining these, we get $x = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Both $z=1$ and $z=-1$ can be verified as solutions for any choice of integer $k$.\n\n4.  **Solve for Purely Imaginary Solutions ($x=0$)**:\n    *   The second equation becomes $0=0$, which is always true.\n    *   The first equation becomes $-y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n    *   Analysis of this equation shows that solutions for $y$ only exist if $C_k < 0$, which means $k$ must be a negative integer ($k \\le -1$).\n    *   For each such $k$, there is a unique solution for $y$, and it is always negative. Let $m = -k$ be a positive integer ($m \\ge 1$). Then $C_k = - (2\\pi m - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. The equation becomes $-y = e^{y(2\\pi m - \\pi/2)}$.\n    *   The solution can be expressed using the Lambert W function, $W(s)e^{W(s)}=s$, as $y_m = -\\frac{W(2\\pi m - \\pi/2)}{2\\pi m - \\pi/2}$.\n\n5.  **Final Solutions**: The solutions found are:\n    *   Two real solutions: $z=1, z=-1$.\n    *   An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions: $z_m = -i \\frac{W(2\\pi m - \\frac{\\pi}{2})}{2\\pi m - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and displays these solutions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\ndef solve_and_print_zi_iz():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints the solutions to the equation z*i = i^z.\n    The solutions are found by representing z as x+iy and solving the resulting\n    system of equations for real and imaginary parts.
