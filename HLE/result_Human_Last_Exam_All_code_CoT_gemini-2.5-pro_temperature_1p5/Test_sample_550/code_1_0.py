# The dimension of the ambient space H^4 over R is n = 4 * 4 = 16.
n = 16

# We are asked for the dimension of the 9th cohomology group, so k = 9.
k = 9

# According to Alexander Duality, the k-th cohomology of the complement of a space A
# is related to the homology of A. The dimension is given by:
# dim H^k(M, Q) = dim H_tilde_{n-k-1}(A, Q)
# where M is the space we are interested in, and A is the union of subspaces.
homology_degree = n - k - 1

# As explained in the reasoning, the union of subspaces A is contractible.
# A contractible space has trivial reduced homology groups in all degrees.
# Therefore, the dimension of the homology group is 0.
dim_homology_A = 0

# The dimension of the cohomology group is equal to the dimension of this homology group.
dim_cohomology_M = dim_homology_A

# Print out the final equation and the result.
