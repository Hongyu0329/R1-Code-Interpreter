# Part (a) Reasoning:
# Two diagonal matrices A and B are similar if and only if B can be obtained
# from A by permuting the diagonal entries. Any permutation of diagonal entries
# corresponds to a change of basis using a permutation matrix P, such that B = PAP⁻¹.
# Having the same diagonal entries up to permutation is equivalent to having the
# same multiset of eigenvalues. This means the multiplicities of each eigenvalue
# must be identical for A and B. Thus, the statement is true.
ans_a = "Yes"

# Part (b) Calculation:
# We need to count the number of multisets of size k=3 with elements
# chosen from a set of n=3 distinct eigenvalues {alpha, beta, gamma}.
# This is a combinations with repetition problem.
# The formula is C(n + k - 1, k).
n = 3
k = 3

# We calculate C(3 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(5, 3).
ans_b = math.comb(n + k - 1, k)
num = n + k - 1
# The simplified calculation is (5 * 4 * 3) / (3 * 2 * 1)
calc_str_b = f"({num} * {num-1} * {num-2}) / ({k} * {k-1} * 1)"

# Part (c) Reasoning:
# The number of similarity classes for n x n diagonal matrices over a field F_q
# is the number of multisets of size n chosen from q elements.
# The formula is C(n + q - 1, n). For a fixed q, this is a polynomial in n of degree q-1.
# Polynomial growth (e.g., n^c) is not exponential growth (e.g., c^n).
# Therefore, the number of classes does not grow exponentially with n.
ans_c = "No"
