    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will identify the key elements from the description to find the correct physicist.\n\n1.  **Field:** Microscopy, but more broadly, optics.\n2.  **Object:** Concave mirrors.\n3.  **Discovery:** An optical effect in real imagery.\n4.  **Origin:** Accidentally observed by a custodial worker/assistant cleaning the mirrors.\n\nThese clues point to the French physicist Léon Foucault. He is famous for the Foucault pendulum and measuring the speed of light, but he also made significant contributions to optics, including the invention of the Foucault knife-edge test. This test allows for the extremely precise measurement of the shape of a concave mirror's surface, revealing imperfections. The story, possibly apocryphal, is that he was inspired after observing a cleaning person wiping a mirror, which highlighted the surface's contours.\n\nI will now provide a python script to print the name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the name of the physicist who matches the description.\n  The physicist is Léon Foucault, known for the Foucault knife-edge test used to\n  check the surface of concave mirrors.\n  \"\"\"\n  physicist_name = \"Léon Foucault\"\n  print(physicist_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Léon Foucault>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
