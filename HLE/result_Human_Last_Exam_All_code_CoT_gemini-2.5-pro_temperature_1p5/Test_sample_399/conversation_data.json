    "The user wants me to solve a first-order ordinary differential equation with an initial value and find the solution at a specific point.\n\n**My plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of differential equation:** The given equation, $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$, is a separable differential equation.\n2.  **Separate the variables:** Rewrite the equation as $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$.\n3.  **Integrate both sides:**\n    *   $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt$\n    *   This yields: $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$, where C is the integration constant.\n4.  **Use the initial condition to find C:**\n    *   We are given $x(0) = -8$. Substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution.\n    *   $-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$\n    *   This simplifies to $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n5.  **Write the particular solution:**\n    *   Substitute $C = \\frac{1}{8}$ back into the equation: $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$.\n    *   Solve for $x(t)$: $x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}$.\n6.  **Calculate x(1):**\n    *   Substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution.\n    *   $x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1^2}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}} = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n7.  **Create a Python script** that performs this final calculation and prints the steps and the result.\n\n```python\n# The initial value problem is x'(t) = (t-1) * x^2(t) with x(0) = -8.\n# The general solution after integration is -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C.\n# Using x(0) = -8, we find C = 1/8.\n# The particular solution is x(t) = 1 / (-t^2/2 + t - 1/8).\n\n# We want to find x(1).\nt = 1\n\n# Define the terms in the denominator of the equation for x(t)\nterm1_val = -t**2 / 2\nterm1_num = -t**2\nterm1_den = 2\n\nterm2_val = t\n\nterm3_val = -1/8\nterm3_num = -1\nterm3_den = 8\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = 1 / (term1_val + term2_val + term3_val)\n\n# Print the calculation steps\nprint(\"To find x(1), we substitute t=1 into the particular solution x(t) = 1 / (-t^2/2 + t - 1/8):\")\nprint(f\"\\nx(1) = 1 / (-({t})^2/{term1_den} + {term2_val} - 1/{term3_den})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 1 / ({term1_val} + {term2_val} + {term3_val})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 1 / (4/8 - 1/8)\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 1 / (3/8)\")\nprint(f\"The final result is: {result}\")\n<<<8/3>>>\n```"
