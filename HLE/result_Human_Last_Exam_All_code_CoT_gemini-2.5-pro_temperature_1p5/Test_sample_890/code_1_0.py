The combination of clinical features, especially the cleft palate, distinctive facial dysmorphisms (midface hypoplasia, micrognathia), and significant speech/developmental delay, is highly characteristic of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a microdeletion on the long arm of chromosome 22.
While other chromosomal abnormalities can cause some of these features, the specific constellation presented in the case points most strongly to an issue with Chromosome 22.
