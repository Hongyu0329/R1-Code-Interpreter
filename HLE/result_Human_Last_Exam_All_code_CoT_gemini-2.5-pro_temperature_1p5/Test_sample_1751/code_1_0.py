    print("Molecule A: C16-dihydroceramide (d18:0/16:0)")
    print("  - Sphingoid base (d18:0): 18 carbons, 0 double bonds (fully saturated).")
    print("  - Fatty acid (16:0): 16 carbons, 0 double bonds (fully saturated).")
    print("  - Conclusion: Both hydrocarbon chains are straight and flexible.\n")

    print("Molecule B: C16-ceramide (d18:1/16:0)")

    print("  - Fatty acid (16:0): 16 carbons, 0 double bonds (fully saturated).")
    print("  - Conclusion: The sphingoid base chain has a slight, rigid kink due to the double bond.\n")

    # Step 2: Explain the principle of molecular packing in a monolayer.
    print("Step 2: Relating molecular structure to packing efficiency\n---------------------------------------------------------")
    print("In a monolayer at an air-water interface, lipids are compressed together.")
    print("The ability of lipids to pack tightly depends on the shape of their hydrophobic tails.")
    print("Saturated chains, being linear and flexible, can align parallel to each other, maximizing attractive van der Waals forces. This results in very dense, ordered packing.")
    print("Unsaturated chains introduce kinks that disrupt this parallel alignment, creating more space between molecules and leading to less dense, disordered packing.\n")

    # Step 3: Compare the two lipids based on the packing principle.
    print("Step 3: Comparing the two lipids\n-----------------------------------")
    print("C16-dihydroceramide, with its two fully saturated chains, can pack very efficiently and form highly ordered domains.")
    print("C16-ceramide has a 'trans' double bond. While less disruptive than a 'cis' bond, this still introduces a structural defect that prevents the chains from packing as tightly as fully saturated ones. This leads to less ordered domains, as stated in the problem description.\n")

    # Step 4: Conclude which lipid has a lower surface area.
    print("Step 4: Final Conclusion\n--------------------------")
    print("Tighter packing means that more molecules can fit into a given area.")
    print("Equivalently, it means that each molecule occupies a smaller surface area upon compression.")
    print("Since C16-dihydroceramide packs more tightly, it will have a lower surface area when compressed in a monolayer.\n")
