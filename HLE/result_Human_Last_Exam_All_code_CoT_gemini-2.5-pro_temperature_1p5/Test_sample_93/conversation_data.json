    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Equation:** The goal is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions ($x_i \\ge 0$) for the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$.\n\n2.  **Optimize the Search:** A naive brute-force approach iterating through all possible values for each of the five variables would be too slow. The search space can be drastically reduced by imposing an order on the variables, such as $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$. This will find unique sets of numbers that solve the equation.\n\n3.  **Count Permutations:** For each unique ordered set of solutions found (e.g., `(a, b, c, d, e)`), the total number of solutions is the number of ways these five numbers can be arranged. This is a permutation calculation. For a set with repeating numbers, the number of permutations is $5! / (n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot ...)$, where $n_i$ is the count of each distinct number in the set.\n\n4.  **Implement the Algorithm:**\n    *   The maximum possible value for any $x_i$ is $\\sqrt{2024} \\approx 44.98$, so we only need to search for integers from 0 to 44.\n    *   Pre-compute the squares of numbers from 0 to 44 to speed up calculations.\n    *   Use five nested loops to search for $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$. The loops will be structured to enforce the order $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5$, which prunes the search space efficiently.\n    *   For each valid combination of $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, calculate the required value for $x_5^2$.\n    *   Check if this value is a perfect square and if the resulting $x_5$ maintains the ordering ($x_5 \\le x_4$).\n    *   If a valid ordered solution is found, store it.\n\n5.  **Calculate and Display the Final Result:**\n    *   Iterate through all the unique ordered solutions found.\n    *   For each one, calculate the number of permutations and add it to a running total.\n    *   The code will print each unique set, the corresponding equation, its number of permutations, and finally the total sum.\n\n### Python Code\n\nHere is the Python script to execute this plan. It will calculate the total number of solutions and print the details of each unique solution set.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom math import factorial\n\ndef solve_diophantine_sum_of_5_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-negative integer solutions for the equation:\n    x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    target = 2024\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(target))\n    \n    # Pre-compute squares for efficiency.\n    squares = [i*i for i in range(limit + 1)]\n    # Use a set for quick checking if a number is a perfect square.\n    perfect_squares = set(squares)\n\n    # This list will store unique ordered solutions where x1>=x2>=x3>=x4>=x5>=0.\n    ordered_solutions = []\n    \n    # We iterate to find the ordered solutions to reduce the search space.\n    for x1 in range(limit, -1, -1):\n        s1 = squares[x1]\n        if s1 > target:\n            continue\n            \n        for x2 in range(x1, -1, -1):\n            s2 = s1 + squares[x2]\n            if s2 > target:\n                continue\n                \n            for x3 in range(x2, -1, -1):\n                s3 = s2 + squares[x3]\n                if s3 > target:\n                    continue\n                    \n                for x4 in range(x3, -1, -1):\n                    s4 = s3 + squares[x4]\n                    if s4 > target:\n                        continue\n                        \n                    remaining = target - s4\n                    \n                    # Check if the remainder is a perfect square and satisfies the order.\n                    if remaining in perfect_squares:\n                        x5 = int(math.sqrt(remaining))\n                        # The final check ensures we only find ordered solutions.\n                        if x5 <= x4:\n                            solution_tuple = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n                            ordered_solutions.append(solution_tuple)\n\n    # --- Calculation of permutations and printing the result ---\n    \n    print(\"The problem is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\")\n    print(\"x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\n\")\n\n    if not ordered_solutions:\n        print(\"No non-negative integer solutions found.\")\n        print(\"\\nTotal number of solutions: 0\")\n        total_count = 0\n    else:\n        print(\"The unique sets of numbers (in descending order) that satisfy the equation are:\")\n        \n        total_count = 0\n        \n        # We sort the list of solutions for a consistent output.\n        for sol in sorted(ordered_solutions):\n            # Count occurrences of each number to handle permutations of non-unique elements.\n            counts = Counter(sol)\n            denominator = 1\n            for count in counts.values():\n                denominator *= factorial(count)\n            \n            perms = factorial(5) // denominator\n            total_count += perms\n            \n            # Display the equation for each unique solution set.\n            equation_str = \" + \".join([f\"{x}^2\" for x in sol])\n            print(f\"Solution set {sol}: {equation_str} = 2024.
