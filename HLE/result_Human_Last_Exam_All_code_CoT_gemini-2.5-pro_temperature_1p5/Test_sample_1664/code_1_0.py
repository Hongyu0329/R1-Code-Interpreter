# The user wants me to analyze a poem and provide the best interpretation from a list of choices.
# My analysis concluded that the phrase "strange tarnished logic of their discipline" refers to the
# overarching theme of the poem: that the act of preservation (the "discipline") is inherently flawed (has "tarnished logic")
# because it ultimately results in decay and degradation (the subjects become "dust").
# This theme applies to both the people in the old photographs and the trapped moths.
# Choice B, "scientific specimen preservation can lead to degradation," is the best expression of this theme.

# The prompt requires me to provide the answer within a Python code block and use a print statement.
# There is no calculation to perform, so I will simply print the letter corresponding to the best answer choice.

best_choice = "B"
