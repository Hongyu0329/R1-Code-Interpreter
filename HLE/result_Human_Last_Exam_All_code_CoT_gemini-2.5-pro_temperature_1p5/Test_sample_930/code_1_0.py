def find_mutualists():
    """
    This function identifies the mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.

    A mutualist is an organism in a relationship where both species benefit. For a flowering
    plant like Asclepias, this typically refers to pollinators who receive nectar in exchange
    for transferring pollen.

    The analysis is as follows:
    - 1: Danaus plexipus (Adult): Pollinator - Mutualist.
    - 2: Megachile frigidus (Adult): Pollinator - Mutualist.
    - 3: Formica rufa (Adult): Nectar robber, not an effective pollinator - Not a mutualist.
    - 4: Sphex ichneumoneus (Adult): Pollinator - Mutualist.
    - 5: Pepsis thisbe (Adult): Pollinator - Mutualist.
    - 6: Megachile ericetorum (Adult): Pollinator - Mutualist.
    - 7: Danaus plexipus (Larva): Herbivore, eats the plant - Not a mutualist.
    - 8-12: The other larvae do not directly interact with the living plant - Not mutualists.
