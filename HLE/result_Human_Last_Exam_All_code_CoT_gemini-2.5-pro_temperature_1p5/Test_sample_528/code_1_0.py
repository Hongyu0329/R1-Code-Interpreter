# The universe of elements is U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
# We need to find the number of tuples of sets (S1, S2, S3, S4) such that:
# 1. S1 is a subset of S2, S2 is a subset of S3, S3 is a subset of S4, and S4 is a subset of U.
# 2. i is in Si for i = 1, 2, 3.

# Let's determine the number of possible placements for each element in U.
# The chain of subsets S1_subset_S2_subset_S3_subset_S4_subset_U creates 5 disjoint regions
# an element can belong to:
# Region 1: S1
# Region 2: S2 \ S1
# Region 3: S3 \ S2
# Region 4: S4 \ S3
# Region 5: U \ S4
# Placing an element in one of these regions determines which of the sets S1, S2, S3, S4 it belongs to.

# We now apply the second condition, i in Si, for i=1, 2, 3.

# For element 1: The condition is 1 in S1.
# This means element 1 must be in Region 1. There is only one choice.
choices_for_1 = 1

# For element 2: The condition is 2 in S2.
# This means element 2 can be in S1 or in S2 \ S1.
# These correspond to Region 1 and Region 2. So, there are two choices.
choices_for_2 = 2

# For element 3: The condition is 3 in S3.
# This means element 3 can be in S1, S2 \ S1, or S3 \ S2.
# These correspond to Region 1, Region 2, and Region 3. So, there are three choices.
choices_for_3 = 3

# For element 4: There is no specific condition.
# It can be placed in any of the 5 regions.
choices_for_4 = 5

# For element 5: There is no specific condition.
# It can be placed in any of the 5 regions.
choices_for_5 = 5

# The total number of ways is the product of the number of choices for each element.
total_sets = choices_for_1 * choices_for_2 * choices_for_3 * choices_for_4 * choices_for_5
