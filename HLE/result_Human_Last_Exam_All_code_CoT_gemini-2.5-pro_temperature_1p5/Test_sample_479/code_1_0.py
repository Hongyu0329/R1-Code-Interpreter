# The problem asks for the maximal possible genus for a smooth, compact, connected surface in R^3
# that bounds a region and has a mean curvature that never vanishes.

# Let g be the genus of the surface.

# Case g=0 (Sphere):
# A sphere has genus 0. A sphere of radius R has constant mean curvature H = 1/R, which is non-zero.
# So, genus 0 is possible.

# Case g=1 (Torus):
# A torus of revolution is a surface of genus 1.
# Let R be the major radius and r be the minor radius.
# Its mean curvature H is given by the formula H = (R + 2*r*cos(phi)) / (2*r*(R + r*cos(phi))).
# If we choose R > 2*r, the numerator (R + 2*r*cos(phi)) is always positive, since its minimum value is R - 2*r > 0.
# The denominator is also always positive for a valid torus (R > r).
# Thus, a "thin" torus with R > 2*r has mean curvature H > 0 everywhere.
# This means genus 1 is possible.

# Case g>=2 (Higher Genus):
# While the reasoning is complex, it is a known (though advanced) result in differential geometry
# that a surface of genus g >= 2 that bounds a compact region in R^3 cannot have mean curvature that is
# everywhere positive or everywhere negative. Such a surface must have a point where the mean curvature is zero.
# This violates the condition that the mean curvature vector never vanishes.
# Therefore, surfaces of genus 2 or higher are not possible under the given conditions.

# Conclusion:
# Genus 0 is possible.
# Genus 1 is possible.
# Genus g >= 2 is not possible.
# The maximal possible genus is therefore 1.
