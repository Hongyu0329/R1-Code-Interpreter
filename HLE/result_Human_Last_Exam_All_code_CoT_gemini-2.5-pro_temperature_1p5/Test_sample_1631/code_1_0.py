    # The problem is to identify the primary scientific basis for using "bypass notches"
    # in sheet metal stamping die design from a list of choices.

    # Step 1: Understand the term "bypass notch".
    # The term itself implies creating a path for material to "bypass" an obstacle.
    # In sheet metal forming, the material from the flat blank must flow into the die cavity.
    # Obstacles to this flow are often sharp corners or complex features in the die geometry
    # that "lock" the sheet and prevent smooth material movement.

    # Step 2: Analyze the consequences of restricted flow.
    # If material cannot flow into an area being deep drawn or stretched, that area will
    # be forced to thin excessively, often leading to fracture or tearing.

    # Step 3: Connect the solution (notch) to the problem (restricted flow).
    # A bypass notch is a strategically placed cutout in the initial blank. It acts as a
    # dedicated channel, allowing material to flow around a restrictive geometric feature
    # and feed into the area where it's needed. This relieves the high tensile strains that
    # would otherwise cause failure.

    # Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding.
    # - Option D: "To counteract issues of material inflow into forming cavities around
    #   complex geometries of the workpiece (e.g. small radii, zero draft angles, etc.)"
    # This option perfectly describes the problem of restricted material flow caused by
    # difficult geometry and implies the notch's function is to improve this inflow.

    # - Other options like (I) "excessive thinning" or (K) "biaxial stretching" describe
    #   the *results* or *symptoms* of poor material flow, but (D) describes the root
    #   cause that the notch directly addresses. Therefore, D is the most fundamental and
    #   accurate answer.

    # The final choice is D. The code will print the logic and the final answer.
    # The prompt's mention of an "equation" is not applicable here, so we will print
    # the final letter choice clearly.

    explanation = """
The scientific basis for using bypass notches is rooted in the management of material flow during the forming process.

1.  **The Challenge of Complex Geometries:** In stamping operations, especially deep drawing, the flat sheet metal must flow and stretch to form a three-dimensional part. When the part has complex geometries like sharp corners, or deep sections adjacent to shallow ones, the material flow can be severely restricted. These features can 'pinch' or 'lock' the material.

2.  **The Problem of Restricted Flow:** When material flow is blocked, the section of the part being formed is starved of material. To make the shape, the available material is forced to stretch excessively, leading to extreme thinning and, ultimately, tearing or splitting.

3.  **The Solution - The Bypass Notch:** A bypass notch is a feature intentionally designed into the initial blank's contour. It acts as a controlled channel or 'bypass' route. This allows material from the blank holder area to flow around the restrictive geometry and feed into the die cavity where it is critically needed. By providing this extra material, the notch prevents excessive localized stretching and failure.

Option D correctly identifies this core function: managing material inflow around complex geometries.
