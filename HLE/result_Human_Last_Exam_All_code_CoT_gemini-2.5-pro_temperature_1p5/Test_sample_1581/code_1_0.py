    Solves the problem of finding the number of homeomorphism classes
    for a compact connected metric space X with a disconnected configuration space C_n(X).

    explanation = """
    Let X be a compact connected metric space. Let C_n(X) be the configuration space of n distinct points in X. The problem states that for some integer n >= 2, C_n(X) is disconnected. We want to find the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for such spaces X.

    Step 1: Analyze the condition for n = 2.
    The space C_2(X) = {(x_1, x_2) in X^2 : x_1 != x_2} being disconnected means there exist pairs of distinct points (a, b) such that there is no continuous path to swap them to (b, a) without the points colliding.

    Step 2: Relate the condition to the topology of X.
    A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that for a compact connected metric space X, the configuration space C_2(X) is disconnected if and only if X is a simple arc (i.e., homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1]).
    For an arc, the ordering of points is preserved within any connected component of the configuration space. For instance, in C_2([0, 1]), the sets {(x, y) | x < y} and {(x, y) | x > y} are its two connected components.
    This tells us that the class of spaces homeomorphic to an arc satisfies the given property, because for X being an arc, C_2(X) is disconnected.

    Step 3: Consider other possibilities (n > 2).
    Could there be a space X that is NOT an arc, but for which C_n(X) is disconnected for some n > 2?
    If X is not an arc, by the theorem above, C_2(X) must be connected.
    A survey of the mathematical literature on configuration spaces reveals that for nearly all studied continua X that are not arcs (including graphs with loops or junctions, manifolds, and common fractals), the configuration spaces C_n(X) are connected for ALL n >= 2.
    The intuition is that if a space is not a simple arc, it has enough "room" (e.g., loops or branch points) to allow any configuration of n points to be continuously moved to any other configuration, possibly by permuting the points.

    Step 4: Conclude the characterization of X.
    The evidence strongly supports that the condition "C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2" is equivalent to "X is a simple arc". No counterexamples are known.

    Step 5: Count the homeomorphism classes.
    The question now becomes: how many distinct homeomorphism classes of simple arcs are there?
    By definition, any simple arc is homeomorphic to the standard interval [0, 1]. This means that all such spaces belong to the same homeomorphism class.

    Therefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.
