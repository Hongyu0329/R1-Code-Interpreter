    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic mathematical problem known as circle packing. Finding the exact analytical solution can be very complex. Instead, we can approach this as an optimization problem and use a Python script to find the solution numerically.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Formulate the Problem**: The task is to find the smallest possible radius, `R`, of a large circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius `r=1`.\n2.  **Optimization Setup**:\n    *   **Variables**: The variables for our optimization will be the `(x, y)` coordinates of the centers of the 14 small circles.\n    *   **Objective**: We want to minimize the radius `R`. The radius `R` is determined by the small circle whose center is farthest from the origin `(0,0)`. Specifically, `R = max(distance_of_center_from_origin) + r`. Since `r` is a constant `1`, our goal is to minimize the maximum distance of any center from the origin.\n    *   **Constraints**: To ensure the circles are \"tightly packed\" without overlapping, the distance between the centers of any two small circles must be at least `2r` (i.e., `2`).\n3.  **Tool Selection**: I will use the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function from Python's SciPy library. It's a powerful tool for solving such constrained numerical optimization problems.\n4.  **Execution**: The script will define the objective function and the constraints, provide a smart initial guess for the circle positions, and then run the optimizer to find the most compact arrangement.\n5.  **Output**: Finally, the code will calculate the radius `R` based on the optimized arrangement and print the final equation and the result rounded to 4 significant digits, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\nfrom math import log10, floor\n\ndef solve_circle_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the circle packing problem for N=14 circles of radius 1.\n    This function uses numerical optimization to find the minimum radius of a\n    larger circle that can contain the smaller circles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of small circles\n    n_circles = 14\n    # Radius of small circles\n    r_small = 1.0\n\n    # --- 1.
