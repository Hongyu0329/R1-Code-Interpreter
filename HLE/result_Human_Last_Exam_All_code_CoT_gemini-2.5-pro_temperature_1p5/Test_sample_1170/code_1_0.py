def solve_algebra_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the posed abstract algebra problem.
    Based on the analysis of the tensor-triangulated category K = D_b(E(C_p)),
    and assuming p=5 from the constraints implied by the list of objects,
    the solution is determined as follows:

    1. The objects that generate a prime tt-ideal are identified. These are:
        - Object 2: kC_p(0)
        - Object 5: gap^1(rad(kC_p))
        - Object 6: gap^{p-1}(rad(kC_p)) which is gap^4 for p=5
        - Object 7: cone(tau)
        - Object 15: The ghost complex S
        This gives the list: 2, 5, 6, 7, 15.

    2. The number of prime tt-ideals not generated by any object on the list is calculated.
       The prime ideals are generated by kC_p(0), cone(tau), S, and gap^j(rad(kC_p)) for j=0..p-1.
       With p=5, the 'gap' primes correspond to j=0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
       The provided list has generators for j=1 and j=4.
       The remaining 'gap' primes correspond to j=0, 2, 3. There are 3 such primes.

    # The number of prime tt-ideals not generated by any of the 20 objects
