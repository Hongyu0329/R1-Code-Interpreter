# Plan:
# 1. Define the knots with at most 4 crossings. We consider the unknot,
#    the trefoil family (right-handed and its mirror), and the figure-eight knot.
# 2. For each knot, determine the distinct homology cobordism elements
#    generated by +1 and -1 integral surgery.
# 3. Sum the number of unique elements from each knot type.

# The knots are:
# - Unknot (0_1): Amphichiral.
# - Trefoil (3_1): Chiral, so we consider 3_1 and its mirror.
# - Figure-eight (4_1): Amphichiral.

# Analysis of elements:
# - Unknot: +1 and -1 surgeries on the unknot both yield S^3, the trivial element '0'.
#   Contribution: 1 element.
