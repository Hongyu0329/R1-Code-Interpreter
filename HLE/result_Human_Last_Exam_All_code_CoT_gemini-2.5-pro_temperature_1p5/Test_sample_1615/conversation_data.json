    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process followed by the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The goal is to find the maximum possible chromatic number ($\\chi(G)$) for a graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph ($K_n$). The chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\n2.  **Establish an upper bound:** For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, we can assign a unique color to each of the $n$ vertices.\n\n3.  **Consider the property of the complete graph:** A graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has a chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is a complete graph ($K_n$). In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, necessitating $n$ distinct colors.\n\n4.  **Apply the problem's constraint:** The problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This gives us an improved upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n5.  **Verify if the upper bound is achievable:** To confirm that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we must show that there exists at least one graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of exactly $n-1$.\n    Let's consider a simple construction:\n    *   Take a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, which we'll call $K_{n-1}$. This subgraph requires $n-1$ colors.\n    *   Add a single, new vertex to the graph, but do not connect it to any of the other vertices. This new vertex is an isolated vertex.\n    *   The resulting graph has $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   This graph is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertices.\n    *   To color this graph, we need $n-1$ colors for the $K_{n-1}$ part. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these colors (or a new one), but the total number of colors is dominated by the $K_{n-1}$ component. The chromatic number of this disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its parts, which is $\\chi(K_{n-1}) = n-1$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We have established that for a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n-1$, and we have demonstrated that a value of $n-1$ can be achieved. Thus, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** For $n = 12345$, the result is $12345 - 1 = 12344$. I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex\n    coloring of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n\n    The logic is as follows:\n    1. A graph with n vertices has a chromatic number of n if and only if it is a\n       complete graph (K_n).\n    2. Since the graph G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be\n       less than n, i.e., chi(G) <= n - 1.\n    3. We can construct a graph with n vertices that is not complete and has a\n       chromatic number of n-1. An example is a complete graph on n-1 vertices\n       plus one isolated vertex.\n    4. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is n - 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    num_vertices = 12345\n    \n    # The maximum number of colors is one less than the number of vertices.\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n    \n    # Print the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {num_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colors needed for a non-complete graph with n vertices is n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_graph_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
