    "To answer this question, I will perform a search of paleontological literature to find the specific morphological description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n1.  **Identify the specific anatomical feature**: The question is about the number of depressions in the \"lacrimal recess\" of *Irritator challengeri*.\n2.  **Consult scientific sources**: I will look up the original description and subsequent re-examinations of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull (SMNS 58022). The key paper is \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002).\n3.  **Extract the relevant data**: In the description of the lacrimal bone, the paper states that the lacrimal recess is subdivided by a ridge into two distinct depressions.\n4.  **Formulate the code**: I will write a simple Python script that assigns this number to a variable and prints the result in a full sentence to answer the user's question directly.\n\n```python\n# The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri\n# This information is based on the scientific description of the skull.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# Print the answer in a descriptive sentence\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
