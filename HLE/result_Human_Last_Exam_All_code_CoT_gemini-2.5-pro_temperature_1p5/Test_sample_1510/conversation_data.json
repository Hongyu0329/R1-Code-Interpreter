    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the 2D crystallographic point groups:** There are 10 such point groups: C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, D1(m), D2(2mm), D3(3m), D4(4mm), and D6(6mm).\n2.  **Determine the order of each point group:** The order of a group is the number of its elements (symmetry operations). We are interested in groups with an order of 2.\n    *   **C2:** This group contains the identity and a 180Â° rotation. Its order is 2.\n    *   **D1 (or m):** This group contains the identity and a single reflection. Its order is 2.\n3.  **List the wallpaper groups for each of these point groups:**\n    *   For point group **C2 (or '2')**, there is 1 wallpaper group: `p2`.\n    *   For point group **D1 (or 'm')**, there are 3 wallpaper groups: `pm`, `pg`, `cm`.\n4.  **Sum the counts:** The total number of wallpaper groups is the sum of the counts from each relevant point group.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the wallpaper groups\n    that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 2D crystallographic point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1 (also denoted as 'm').\n    \n    # List the wallpaper groups associated with each point group of order 2.\n    groups_by_point_group = {\n        \"C2\": [\"p2\"],\n        \"D1 (m)\": [\"pm\", \"pg\", \"cm\"]\n    }\n\n    # Count the number of groups for each point group.\n    count_c2 = len(groups_by_point_group[\"C2\"])\n    count_d1_m = len(groups_by_point_group[\"D1 (m)\"])\n    \n    # Calculate the total.\n    total_groups = count_c2 + count_d1_m\n\n    print(\"The crystallographic point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1 (m).\")\n    print(f\"\\nNumber of wallpaper groups with point group C2: {count_c2}\")\n    print(f\"Number of wallpaper groups with point group D1 (m): {count_d1_m}\")\n\n    # The final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number = {count_c2} (for C2) + {count_d1_m} (for D1) = {total_groups}\")\n\ncount_wallpaper_groups()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
