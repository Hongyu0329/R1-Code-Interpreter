    "To determine the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule**: The reduction of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide cleaves the S-S bond, resulting in two identical molecules of **perylene-3-thiol (C₂₀H₁₂S)**. The calculation will be performed on a single molecule of this product.\n\n2.  **Generate a Graph Representation**: I will use the cheminformatics library RDKit to generate the molecular structure from its SMILES string. As requested, I will include all hydrogen atoms, treating each atom (Carbon, Sulfur, Hydrogen) as a node and each covalent bond as an edge in a graph. This graph will then be analyzed using the NetworkX library.\n\n3.  **Calculate Indices**:\n    *   **Wiener Index (W)**: I will calculate the sum of the shortest path distances between all possible pairs of atoms in the molecular graph.\n    *   **Szeged Index (Sz)**: For every bond (edge) in the molecule, I will count how many atoms lie on each side of the bond. The Szeged index is the sum of the products of these counts over all bonds.\n\n4.  **Compute the Ratio**: Finally, I will compute and print the ratio of the Szeged index to the Wiener index (Sz / W), displaying the values for both indices in the final equation.\n\nThis task requires the `rdkit` and `networkx` python libraries. You can install them using pip:\n`pip install rdkit networkx`\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom rdkit import Chem\n\ndef calculate_indices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for perylene-3-thiol.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
