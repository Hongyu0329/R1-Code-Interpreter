    "Here is my plan to solve this puzzle.\nFirst, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation logic. The inputs are strings representing a grid of numbers. The transformation seems to revolve around the location of the digit '2'.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation Rule:**\n    By comparing `Input_A` with `Output_A`, and `Input_B` with `Output_B`, I've deduced the following rule for the movement of the digit '2':\n    *   The '2' represents a particle that tries to move in each step.\n    *   It first attempts to move diagonally **up and right** (to position `r-1, c+1`). This move is only executed if the target cell is within the grid's boundaries and contains a '0'.\n    *   If the up-right move is not possible (either because the target is out of bounds or not a '0'), it then attempts to move diagonally **up and left** (to position `r-1, c-1`). This move is also only executed if the target cell is within bounds and contains a '0'.\n    *   When a move occurs, the original cell of the '2' becomes '0', and the target cell becomes '2'.\n    *   If no move is possible, the grid remains unchanged (though this case is not present in the examples).\n\n2.  **Apply the Rule to `Input_C`:**\n    *   I will parse `Input_C` ('000000,011120,111111') into a 2D grid.\n    *   The digit '2' is located at row 1, column 4 (0-indexed).\n    *   I will check the first move condition: can it move up-right to row 0, column 5? The cell `grid[0][5]` is '0', so the move is possible.\n    *   I will perform the move: `grid[1][4]` will become '0' and `grid[0][5]` will become '2'.\n    *   Finally, I will convert the modified grid back into a comma-separated string to get the final result.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:**\n    I will write a Python script to implement this logic. The script will take `Input_C` as its input, apply the transformation, and print the resulting string.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by transforming the input grid based on the movement of the digit '2'.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_str = '000000,011120,111111'\n\n    # Parse the input string into a 2D grid of characters\n    rows = input_str.split(',')\n    grid = [list(row) for row in rows]\n    height = len(grid)\n    width = len(grid[0]) if height > 0 else 0\n\n    # Find the location of '2'\n    pos_2 = None\n    for r_idx, row in enumerate(grid):\n        try:\n            c_idx = row.index('2')\n            pos_2 = (r_idx, c_idx)\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            continue\n\n    # If '2' is not found, there is nothing to do.\n    if pos_2 is None:\n        print(input_str)\n        return\n        \n    r, c = pos_2\n    \n    # Rule 1: Attempt to move diagonally up-right\n    # Check if target (r-1, c+1) is within bounds and is '0'\n    if r > 0 and c + 1 < width and grid[r - 1][c + 1] == '0':\n        grid[r][c] = '0'\n        grid[r - 1][c + 1] = '2'\n    # Rule 2: Attempt to move diagonally up-left\n    # Check if target (r-1, c-1) is within bounds and is '0'\n    elif r > 0 and c > 0 and grid[r - 1][c - 1] == '0':\n        grid[r][c] = '0'\n        grid[r - 1][c - 1] = '2'\n\n    # Convert the modified grid back to a string and print it\n    output_rows = [''.join(row) for row in grid]\n    result = ','.join(output_rows)\n    print(result)\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<'000002,011100,111111'>>>"
