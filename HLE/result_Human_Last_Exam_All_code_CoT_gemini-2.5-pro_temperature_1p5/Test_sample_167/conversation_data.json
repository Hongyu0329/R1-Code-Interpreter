    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can use established theorems from graph theory rather than direct computation, as the graph is very large.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I'll explain the key concepts: the chromatic number ($\\chi(G)$), the list chromatic number ($\\chi_l(G)$), and the Alon-Tarsi number ($AT(G)$).\n2.  I'll state the general relationship between these three numbers: $AT(G) \\ge \\chi_l(G) \\ge \\chi(G)$.\n3.  Next, I'll identify the properties of the specific graph $K_{1000,1000}$. It's a complete bipartite graph, which simplifies the problem significantly.\n4.  I will determine the chromatic number of $K_{1000,1000}$, which is 2.\n5.  Then, I will apply a known theorem by Fred Galvin, which states that for any bipartite graph, its list chromatic number is equal to its chromatic number.\n6.  Finally, I will use the fact that the Alon-Tarsi conjecture (which states $AT(G) = \\chi_l(G)$) has been proven to be true for all bipartite graphs.\n7.  By combining these results, I will deduce the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\nThe following Python script will walk through this logical deduction step-by-step and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_k1000_1000():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph K_{1000,1000}\n    by applying established theorems from graph theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    graph_name = \"K_{1000,1000}\"\n    m = 1000\n    n = 1000\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the theoretical background\n    print(f\"Solving for the Alon-Tarsi number of G = {graph_name}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The Alon-Tarsi number, AT(G), is related to the list chromatic\")\n    print(\"number, chi_l(G), and the chromatic number, chi(G), by the\")\n    print(\"following inequality: AT(G) >= chi_l(G) >= chi(G).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the chromatic number of K_{1000,1000}\n    print(f\"Step 2: Determine the chromatic number of {graph_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The graph {graph_name} is a complete bipartite graph.
