# The user wants the shortest possible sequence of commands.
# Let's represent the process as a sequence of 'L' for line and 'C' for circle.

# Initial State:
# - C0: The given circle with center O.
# - P0: Point O, the center of C0.
# - P1: Point A, on the circumference of C0.

# Step 1: Draw a line through O and A to define the first diameter.
# This line intersects C0 at a new point, B.
# We now have points O, A, B.
# Command: L
# Sequence so far: "L"

# Step 2: Construct the perpendicular bisector of the diameter AB.
# This is done by creating two circles of equal radius, centered at A and B.
# The radius must be greater than half the length of AB. We can use the length of AB itself.
# Circle 1: Centered at A, with radius defined by the distance to B.
# Command: C
# Sequence so far: "LC"

# Step 3: Circle 2: Centered at B, with radius defined by the distance to A.
# The two circles from step 2 and 3 will intersect at two new points, P and Q.
# Command: C
# Sequence so far: "LCC"

# Step 4: Draw a line through the new points P and Q. This line is the perpendicular
# bisector of AB and forms the second diameter of the circle.
# This line intersects the original circle C0 at points C and D.
# The points A, C, B, D are the vertices of the inscribed square.
# Command: L
# Final Sequence: "LCCL"

# The problem asks for the shortest possible sequence.
# L: Necessary to define the first diameter. Without the opposite point B,
#    constructing a perpendicular at the center O is much harder.
# CC: Necessary to create the two points (P, Q) that define the perpendicular bisector.
#     A single circle is not sufficient to define a new line.
# L: Necessary to draw the perpendicular bisector line to find the final vertices (C, D).
# Therefore, LCCL appears to be the minimal sequence.
