    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Graph**: A standard 10-node barbell graph is formed by two 5-node complete graphs (K5 cliques) connected by a single \"bridge\" or \"bottleneck\" edge.\n2.  **Count the Edges**: We need to find the total number of edges in this graph.\n    *   First, we'll calculate the number of edges in a single K5 clique using the formula for edges in a complete graph, `E = n(n-1)/2`, where `n` is the number of nodes.\n    *   Then, we'll sum the edges from the two cliques and add the one bridge edge to get the total number of edges in the barbell graph.\n3.  **Calculate the Probability**: In randomized uniform gossiping, an edge is selected uniformly at random from all possible edges. The probability of picking a specific edge (in this case, the single bottleneck edge) is `1 / (Total Number of Edges)`.\n4.  **Code the Solution**: A Python script will be created to perform these calculations and print out the steps, the final equation with all its numerical components, and the resulting probability.\n\n```python\ndef solve_barbell_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A 10-node barbell graph consists of two cliques.\n    # The total number of nodes is 10, so each clique will have 10 / 2 = 5 nodes.\n    nodes_per_clique = 5\n    \n    # The number of edges in a complete graph (clique) with 'n' nodes is n * (n - 1) / 2.\n    edges_in_one_clique = nodes_per_clique * (nodes_per_clique - 1) // 2\n    \n    # The total number of edges is the sum of edges in the two cliques plus the single bottleneck edge connecting them.\n    num_cliques = 2\n    bottleneck_edges = 1\n    total_edges = (num_cliques * edges_in_one_clique) + bottleneck_edges\n    \n    # The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1 / total_edges.\n    numerator = 1\n    denominator = total_edges\n    probability = numerator / denominator\n\n    print(f\"The 10-node barbell graph has two {nodes_per_clique}-node cliques connected by {bottleneck_edges} bridge edge.\")\n    print(f\"The number of edges in one {nodes_per_clique}-node clique is: {edges_in_one_clique}\")\n    print(f\"The total number of edges in the graph is: (2 * {edges_in_one_clique}) + {bottleneck_edges} = {total_edges}\")\n    print(\"\\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, an edge is chosen uniformly at random.\")\n    print(\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the ratio of bottleneck edges to total edges.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"Probability = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe probability is approximately: {probability:.5f}\")\n\nsolve_barbell_probability()\n```\n<<<0.04762>>>"
