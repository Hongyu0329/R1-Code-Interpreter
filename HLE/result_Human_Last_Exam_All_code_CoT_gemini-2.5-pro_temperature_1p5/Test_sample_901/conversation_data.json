    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. The solvent is its conjugate acid, tert-butyl alcohol. This combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base is characteristic of an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reaction:** The E2 mechanism has a strict geometric requirement. The leaving group (in this case, Br) and the beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) that is being removed must be in an *anti-periplanar* conformation. For a cyclohexane ring, this means that both the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must be in *axial* positions on the ring.\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis of the Reactant:**\n    *   The stereochemical descriptor (1S,2R) for 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *trans* to each other.\n    *   Cyclohexane rings exist in two rapidly interconverting chair conformations.\n    *   **More Stable Conformation:** To minimize steric hindrance, bulky groups prefer to be in equatorial positions. For a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, it's possible for both the Br and methyl groups to be equatorial. However, in this stable conformation, the Br is not axial, so the E2 reaction cannot occur.\n    *   **Reactive Conformation:** For the reaction to proceed, the ring must flip to a less stable conformation where the leaving group (Br) is in an axial position. Because the methyl group is trans to the bromine, this ring flip forces the methyl group into an axial position as well. This conformation is higher in energy, but it is the one through which the reaction must proceed.\n\n4.  **Identify Available Beta-Hydrogens:** With the bromine at carbon C1 (axial) and the methyl group at C2 (axial), we examine the hydrogens on the adjacent beta-carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2 (the carbon with the methyl group):** Since the methyl group is axial, the hydrogen on C2 must be equatorial. This hydrogen is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination to form the more substituted Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) is stereochemically forbidden.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens: one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is perfectly positioned anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Product Identification:**\n    *   The bulky base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6.\n    *   Elimination occurs between C1 and C6, forming a double bond there. The methyl group at C2 is unaffected.\n    *   The resulting alkene is named by numbering the double bond carbons as 1 and 2. The methyl group is then located on carbon 3.\n    *   Thus, the sole product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines and prints the name of the product from the reaction of\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.\n    The analysis, based on the stereochemical requirements of the E2 mechanism,\n    conclusively shows that only one product can be formed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Reactant name parts\n    reactant_stereochem = \"(1S,2R)\"\n    reactant_substituents = \"1-bromo-2-methyl\"\n    reactant_parent = \"cyclohexane\"\n\n    # Product name\n    # The elimination is regioselective due to stereochemical constraints.\n    # The double bond forms between C1 and C6, leading to the Hofmann product.\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    \n    # The final equation is:\n    # (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane ---[KOC(CH3)3]--> 3-methylcyclohexene\n    # As requested, the numbers in the final result are included in the printout.\n    \n    print(\"Reactant: {}-{}\".format(reactant_stereochem, reactant_substituents + reactant_parent))\n    print(\"Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide\")\n    print(\"Reaction Type: E2 Elimination\")\n    print(f\"Final Product Name: {product_name}\")\n\n\nidentify_reaction_product()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
