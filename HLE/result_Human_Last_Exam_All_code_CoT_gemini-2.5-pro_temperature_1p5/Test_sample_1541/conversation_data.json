    "Of course! I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem and determine the memory usage for the most efficient C program.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\nMy goal is to solve the problem of sorting the summands in a given string while also determining the minimum memory required for a C program to perform this task.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The input is a string of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) and plus signs, like \"3+1+4+1+2\". The goal is to sort the numbers and print them back in the same format, e.g., \"1+1+2+3+4\".\n\n2.  **Devise a Memory-Efficient C Algorithm:**\n    *   A naive approach would be to read the string, extract the numbers into an integer array, sort the array, and then print the result. This would require an array to store the input string (e.g., `char s[1001]`) and another array to store the numbers (e.g., `int nums[501]`), which is not very memory-efficient.\n    *   A much better approach is to use a variation of Counting Sort. Since we know the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4, we don't need to store the numbers themselves. We only need to count their frequencies. We can read the input character by character, avoiding storing the entire string in memory.\n\n3.  **C Program Memory Optimization:**\n    To write the *most* memory-efficient program, we must carefully select the data types for our variables based on the problem's constraints (string length <= 1000, so at most 500 numbers).\n    *   **Counts Array:** We need an array to store the counts of '1', '2', '3', and '4'. The maximum count for any number is 500 (e.g., a string of 500 '1's). A standard `char` (max value 127) is too small. An `unsigned short int` (typically 2 bytes, max value 65,535) is perfect. So, `unsigned short int counts[4];` will be used.\n    *   **Other Variables:** We will need variables for reading input (`char c`), loop counters, and a flag to handle printing the '+' signs correctly. We can use the smallest possible types for these as well: `char` for the input character, `char` for the outer loop counter (0-3), and `unsigned short int` for the inner loop counter (up to 500).\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Memory (`m`):**\n    Based on the optimized C program design, the memory usage for variables would be:\n    *   `unsigned short int counts[4];`: 4 * `sizeof(unsigned short int)` = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n    *   `char c;`: For reading each character. `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n    *   `char first;`: A flag for printing. `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n    *   `char i;`: Outer loop counter (0-3). `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n    *   `unsigned short int j;`: Inner loop counter (up to 500). `sizeof(unsigned short int)` = 2 bytes.\n    *   **Total Memory (m):** 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **13 bytes**.\n\n### Python Solution\n\nHere is a simple and efficient Python script to solve the Xenia problem. It reads the sum, splits it into numbers, sorts them, and joins them back together.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum string, sorts the numbers, and prints the new sum.\n    Example: 3+2+1 -> 1+2+3\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input string, e.g., \"3+2+1\"\n    s = input()\n    \n    # Split the string by '+' to get a list of number strings: ['3', '2', '1']\n    numbers = s.split('+')\n    \n    # Sort the list of numbers. Lexicographical sort works since they are single digits.\n    # ['3', '2', '1'] becomes ['1', '2', '3']\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Join the sorted list back into a string with '+': \"1+2+3\"\n    new_sum = \"+\".join(numbers)\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(new_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
