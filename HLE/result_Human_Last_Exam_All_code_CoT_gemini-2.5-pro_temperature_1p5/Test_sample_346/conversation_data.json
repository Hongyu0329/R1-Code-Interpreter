    "An elegant way to solve this is to simplify the combinator expression by hand first, but this process is notoriously complex and prone to errors. A more robust method is to write a program that interprets the SKI calculus and evaluates the expression directly.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Represent Combinators**: I'll create Python classes to represent the `S`, `K`, `I` combinators and function application (`App`).\n2.  **Build the Expression**: I will translate the given string expression into a nested structure of these Python objects. This structure will form an expression tree.\n3.  **Implement an Evaluator**: I'll write a function that knows how to reduce SKI expressions according to the rules (`S x y z => x z (y z)`, `K x y => x`, `I x => x`). The evaluation will be done using normal-order reduction (leftmost, outermost), which is crucial for handling potentially non-terminating branches.\n4.  **Evaluate the Church Numeral**: A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes a successor function `f` and a starting value `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. To find the integer value of our expression, I will apply it to a Python lambda `f = lambda i: i + 1` and the integer `x = 0`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Once the expression evaluates to an integer `n`, I will calculate `log_2(n)` and present the final equation and result.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\n# A higher recursion limit might be needed for deeply nested expressions.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(20000)\n\n# Step 1: Define classes for SKI calculus representation.\n# We have a base class `Expr` and specific classes for S, K, I, and Application.\n\nclass Expr:\n    \"\"\"Base class for all SKI expressions.\"\"\"\n    def __call__(self, arg):\n        #
