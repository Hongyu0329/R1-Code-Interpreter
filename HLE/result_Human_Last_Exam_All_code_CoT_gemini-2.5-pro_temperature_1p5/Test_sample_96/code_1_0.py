# The problem asks for the number of certain torsion elements in the quotient
# of the E8 Artin group by its center.
# Based on the theory of Artin groups, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct
# Coxeter elements in the Artin group A(E8).

# 1. A Coxeter element is a product of all n standard generators in some order.
#    For E8, the number of generators is n=8.
# 2. The number of distinct Coxeter elements in the Artin group is given by the
#    number of acyclic orientations of the Coxeter graph.
# 3. The Coxeter graph for a spherical type (like E_n) is a tree.
# 4. For any tree with n vertices, the number of acyclic orientations is 2^(n-1).

# Number of standard generators for the Artin group of type E8.
n = 8

# The final equation to calculate the number of elements is 2**(n-1).
count = 2**(n-1)

# We output the numbers in the final equation and the result.
print(f"The number of generators is n = {n}.")
print(f"The number of elements is calculated by the equation: 2^(n - 1) = 2^({n} - 1) = 2^{n-1}")
print(f"Calculation: 2**{n-1} = {count}")
print(f"\nThe total number of such torsion elements is {count}.")
