    This function determines the safe goal for the AI model M.

    The model M cannot prove predictive success due to the uncomputability of the
    set of "good" predictor indices. Therefore, it must pursue a goal that is
    computable and based on observable outcomes.

    1.  The model's action is to select a predictor.
    2.  The outcome of this action is immediate feedback: the prediction is correct or incorrect.
    3.  This setup perfectly matches a reinforcement learning problem, where an agent
        learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward signal.

    The learning framework is 'Reinforcement-learning'.
    The source of the learning signal is the 'feedback'.

    The safe goal is therefore "Reinforcement-learning from feedback".
