# Step 1: Define the generating vectors
u = [6, 0, 0]
v = [7/2, math.sqrt(13)/2, 0]

# Step 2: Determine the diagonal vectors
d1 = [u[i] + v[i] for i in range(3)]
d2 = [v[i] - u[i] for i in range(3)]

# Step 3: Calculate the components for the dot product formula
# Dot product of d1 and d2
dot_product = sum(d1[i] * d2[i] for i in range(3))

# Magnitudes of d1 and d2
mag_d1 = math.sqrt(sum(x**2 for x in d1))
mag_d2 = math.sqrt(sum(x**2 for x in d2))

# Cosine of the angle between the vectors d1 and d2
# This will be non-zero as the generating vectors don't have equal magnitudes
cos_phi = dot_product / (mag_d1 * mag_d2)

# Step 4: Identify all possible values for cos(theta)
# The angles between the intersecting diagonal lines are supplementary.
# Their cosines are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.
possible_cos_values = {cos_phi, -cos_phi}

# Step 5: Calculate a and b
# a is the sum of all possible values of cos(theta)
a = sum(possible_cos_values)

# b is the number of possible values for cos(theta)
b = len(possible_cos_values)

# Step 6: Calculate the final result
result = a * b

# Round the answer to the nearest thousandth
rounded_result = round(result, 3)

# Print the final equation with the computed values
# Note: 'a' is practically zero due to floating point arithmetic, so we format it nicely.
print(f"The sum of possible values (a) is: {a:.3f}")
print(f"The number of possible values (b) is: {b}")
print(f"The final equation is: {a:.3f} * {b} = {rounded_result:.3f}")
