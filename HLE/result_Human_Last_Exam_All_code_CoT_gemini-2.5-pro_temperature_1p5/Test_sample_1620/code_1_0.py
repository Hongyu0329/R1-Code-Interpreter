    explanation = """
The core issue is the conflict between a lawyer's duty of confidentiality and the need to prevent imminent harm. While lawyers have a strict duty to keep client information confidential, this duty is not absolute.

The Rules of Professional Conduct in Ontario, like in most jurisdictions, have a "public safety" exception. This exception allows a lawyer to disclose confidential information when they have a reasonable belief that there is an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to an identifiable person.

In this case:
1.  **The Threat was Imminent and Serious:** Eric's statement, "I'm going to my wifeâ€™s apartment tonight to end things for both of us," coupled with the mention of a gun, constitutes a clear and imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.
2.  **The Belief was Reasonable:** Given the specificity of the threat and Eric's deteriorating emotional state, James's belief that the threat was real was reasonable.
3.  **The Disclosure was Necessary:** James disclosed the information to the police, the appropriate authority to prevent such an act. The details he provided (names, addresses) were necessary for the police to intervene effectively and prevent the tragedy.

Therefore, James's actions were justified under the public safety exception to the duty of confidentiality.

- Choice A is incorrect because the threat for "tonight" is imminent.
- Choice B is incorrect as it wrongly states confidentiality is absolute.
- Choice C is incorrect because the information disclosed was necessary for the police to act.
- Choice D is incorrect because the lawyer's permission to disclose comes from the threat itself, not a subsequent police request.
- Choice E correctly identifies that James acted on a reasonable belief of an imminent threat and the disclosure was necessary to prevent the harm.
