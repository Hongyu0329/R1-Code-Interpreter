    # --- Explanation of the Lower Bound ---
    # The problem asks for the minimum number of Statistical Queries (SQ) to learn a
    # poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer ReLU network on N(0, I_d) data.
    
    # 1. Reduction to a simpler problem: The class of two-hidden-layer ReLU networks
    # contains the class of single ReLU neurons. Therefore, any lower bound on the
    # query complexity for learning a single neuron also applies to this problem.
    
    # 2. Known SQ Lower Bound: Based on established results in learning theory
    # (e.g., Song et al., 2017), learning even a single ReLU neuron with an SQ algorithm
    # under the specified conditions (Gaussian data, polynomial error, non-negligible
    # tolerance) is known to be hard.
    
    # 3. The Formula: The minimum number of queries required is super-polynomial.
    # The lower bound is expressed asymptotically as d to the power of log(d).

    # We will print this in a readable format.
