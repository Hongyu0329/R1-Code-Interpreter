    Identifies and lists the San Francisco Nov 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by a competing measure.
    
    The competing pairs are:
    - Proposition C vs. Proposition D
    - Proposition I vs. Proposition J
    - Proposition L vs. Proposition M
    
    In each pair, if both measures pass, the one with fewer 'Yes' votes is nullified.
    Therefore, all six of these propositions could potentially be nullified.
