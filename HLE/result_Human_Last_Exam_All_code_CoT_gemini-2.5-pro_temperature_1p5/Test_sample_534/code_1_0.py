# The problem asks for the number of components of a set I,
# which is the intersection of all compact connected neighborhoods of a point 'a' in a space 'X'.

# Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step.

# 1. Understanding the space X and the point a.
# The set P is a union of four line segments in the yz-plane, forming a connected Π-like shape.
# The space X is the union of:
#   A) The line segment A = [0,1] x {0} x {0} on the x-axis.
#   B) Four copies of P, placed in planes where x=0, x=1/4, x=1/2, and x=1. Let's call them P_0, P_1/4, P_1/2, P_1.
# The entire space X is connected because each P_x is connected to the segment A.
# The point a = (0, 1, 0) is located in the P_0 copy (the one at x=0). Specifically, it corresponds to the point (y=1, z=0) on the base of the Π shape in P.

# 2. Analyzing the neighborhood of 'a'.
# We need to see what the space X looks like very close to 'a'.
# Let's find the distance from 'a' to other parts of X that are not P_0.
# - The distance from a=(0,1,0) to the plane of P_1/4 is 1/4.
# - The distance from a=(0,1,0) to the axis segment A is sqrt(x^2 + (1-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) >= 1.
# The closest part of X to 'a' (that is not in P_0) is P_1/4, at a distance of 1/4.

# 3. Local Connectedness at 'a'.
# If we consider a small open ball B(a, r) around 'a' with a radius r < 1/4, its intersection with X will only contain points from P_0.
# Now let's look at P_0 near 'a'. The point 'a' lies on the base segment of the Π shape.
# The distance from this point to the "legs" of the Π (at y=1/3 and y=2/3) is at least 1/3.
# So, if we choose our radius r to be even smaller, for instance r = 0.1, the neighborhood B(a, r) intersected with X is just a piece of the straight line segment forming the base of P_0.
# A piece of a line segment is a connected set.
# This means that 'a' has a basis of connected neighborhoods. Therefore, the space X is "locally connected" at 'a'.

# 4. Finding the intersection set I.
# For a space that is locally connected at a point 'a', it is possible to find a sequence of smaller and smaller compact connected neighborhoods whose intersection is just the point 'a' itself.
# For example, the sets C_n = {(0, y, 0) | 1 - 1/n <= y <= 1} for n=1, 2, 3... are all compact and connected neighborhoods of 'a'. Their intersection is just {a}.
# The intersection I of ALL compact connected neighborhoods of 'a' must therefore be {a}.
# I = {(0, 1, 0)}.

# 5. Counting the components of I.
# The set I is a single point. A set containing a single point is connected.
# Therefore, the set I has exactly one connected component.

# This step-by-step reasoning leads to the final number.
number_of_components = 1

# Final output as requested
print(f"The set is the intersection of all compact connected neighborhoods of a = (0,1,0).")
print(f"This intersection is the single point set I = {{(0,1,0)}}.")
print(f"A single point set has exactly one connected component.")
print(f"The number of components is: {number_of_components}")
