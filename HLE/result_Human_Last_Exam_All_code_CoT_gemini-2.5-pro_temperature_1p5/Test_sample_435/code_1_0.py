    Based on the known biological functions of Interleukin-15 (IL-15), it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured in the presence of IL-15 will exhibit an enhanced capacity for cytokine release upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it.
    
    The reasoning for this prediction is as follows:
    
    1. Promotion of a Superior T Cell Phenotype: IL-15 is critical for the survival and maintenance of long-lived memory T cells (specifically central memory and stem cell memory phenotypes). Culturing CAR T cells with IL-15 enriches for this less differentiated, more persistent cell type. These cells are known for their high proliferative potential and robust function upon re-stimulation.
    
    2. Enhanced In Vivo Persistence and Fitness: Unlike some other cytokines (e.g., IL-2) that can push T cells towards terminal differentiation and exhaustion, IL-15 supports the long-term survival and metabolic fitness of T cells. This results in a CAR T cell product that is more likely to persist, expand, and remain functional in the patient after infusion.
    
    3. Potent Effector Function upon Activation: A healthier, more persistent, and larger population of CAR T cells will naturally mount a more potent anti-tumor response when they encounter their target antigen. A key component of this response is the secretion of effector cytokines such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), and others. Because the IL-15-cultured cells are more 'fit,' each cell, and the population as a whole, can produce more cytokines for a longer duration.
    
    In summary, by fostering a more persistent and functionally robust CAR T cell product, IL-15 pre-conditions the cells to mount a stronger response upon activation, which directly translates to increased and more sustained cytokine release.
