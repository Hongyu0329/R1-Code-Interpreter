    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Method explanation\n\n1.  **Identify the spaces and the map:**\n    *   The domain is $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Here, $\\Omega X$ is the loop space of $X$, $\\Sigma X$ is the reduced suspension of $X$, and $X \\wedge Y$ is the smash product of $X$ and $Y$.\n    *   The codomain is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Using the property $S^p \\wedge S^q \\simeq S^{p+q}$, the codomain is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   The map is a specific instance of a general map in homotopy theory, often denoted $H_{p,q}: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q) \\to \\Omega(S^p \\wedge S^q)$. In our case, $p=4$ and $q=6$.\n\n2.  **Definition of Connectivity:**\n    The connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n\n3.  **Relate to a Known Result using Adjointness:**\n    The map in question, $H_{p,q}$, is the adjoint of another important map, let's call it $L_{p,q}$:\n    $L_{p,q}: \\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q \\to \\Omega^2(S^p \\wedge S^q)$.\n    The relationship between a map and its adjoint is a fundamental tool in homotopy theory. Let's denote the user's map as $H$ and the map above as $L$. The map $H$ is the adjoint of $L$.\n    There is a standard theorem relating their connectivities:\n    If a map $g: X \\to \\Omega Y$ is $k$-connected, its adjoint $\\hat{g}: \\Sigma X \\to Y$ is $(k+1)$-connected.\n    Our map $L$ is of the form $g: X \\to \\Omega Y$ (with $Y=\\Omega(S^p \\wedge S^q)$), and our map $H$ is its adjoint $\\hat{g}$.\n    Thus, $\\text{connectivity}(H) = \\text{connectivity}(L) + 1$.\n\n4.  **Connectivity of the Adjoint Map:**\n    A known result in algebraic topology (for example, in Neisendorfer's \"Algebraic Methods in Unstable Homotopy Theory\") states that the connectivity of the map $L_{p,q}: \\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q \\to \\Omega^2(S^p \\wedge S^q)$ is $p+q-2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Connectivity:**\n    Combining the results from steps 3 and 4, the connectivity of our map $H_{p,q}$ is $(p+q-2) + 1 = p+q-1$.\n    For the specific case requested by the user, we have $p=4$ and $q=6$.\n    So, the connectivity is $4 + 6 - 1 = 9$.\n\nNow, I will provide a Python script to perform this calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the connectivity of the map\n    Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The map is of the general form H_{p,q}: Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q).\n    # In this case, the sphere dimensions are p and q.\n    p = 4\n    q = 6\n\n    print(f\"The map is defined for spheres of dimension p and q.\")\n    print(f\"Value of p: {p}\")\n    print(f\"Value of q: {q}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # A known result in homotopy theory states that the connectivity of this map is given by the formula p + q - 1.\n    # This result is derived by considering the adjoint map L_{p,q}: Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q -> Omega^2(S^p wedge S^q),\n    # whose connectivity is p + q - 2. The connectivity of a map's adjoint suspension is one higher.\n\n    print(\"The formula for the connectivity is p + q - 1.\")\n\n    # Calculate the connectivity\n    connectivity = p + q - 1\n\n    # Output the final equation with the numbers plugged in\n    print(f\"Calculation: {p} + {q} - 1 = {connectivity}\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the map is {connectivity}.\")\n\nsolve_connectivity()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
