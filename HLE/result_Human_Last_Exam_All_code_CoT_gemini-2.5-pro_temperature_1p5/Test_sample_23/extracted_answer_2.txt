The number of non-admissible integers depends on the given positive integers `a` and `b`. The formula is as follows:
- If `a = 1` or `b = 1`, the number of non-admissible integers is `ab`.
- If `a > 1` and `b > 1`:
    - If `ab` is even, the number is `ab / 2`.
    - If `ab` is odd, the number is `(ab + 1) / 2`.
