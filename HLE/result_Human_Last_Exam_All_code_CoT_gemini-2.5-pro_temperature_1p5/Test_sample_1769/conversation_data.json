    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the linguistic journey, followed by a Python script that prints the final answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Current Word:** First, I'll examine the origin of our modern word \"sister.\" It comes from the Old Norse word \"systir,\" which was brought to England by Viking invaders and settlers.\n2.  **Identify the Native Word:** Next, I'll identify the original, native Old English word for \"sister\" that was used before the Norse influence. This word was \"sweostor.\"\n3.  **Trace Linguistic Evolution:** The core of the task is to trace how \"sweostor\" would have naturally evolved into Modern English if it hadn't been replaced. This involves applying known sound changes that occurred in the English language over the centuries.\n4.  **Provide the Hypothetical Word:** Based on this linguistic tracing, I will determine the most likely Modern English word. The attested Middle English form \"suster,\" which was a direct descendant of \"sweostor\" and competed with \"sister\" for a time, provides a strong clue. This form would likely have become \"suster\" in Modern English.\n5.  **Present in Code:** Finally, I will present this explanation and the resulting word in a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and prints the likely Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the origin of the current word \"sister\"\n    print(\"Step 1: The Origin of 'Sister'\")\n    explanation1 = \"\"\"\\\n    The modern English word 'sister' is not a direct descendant from Old English.\n    It was borrowed from the Old Norse word 'systir' during the period of\n    Viking invasions and settlement in England (roughly 8th to 11th centuries).\n    The Norse word replaced the native English one.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation1))\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the original Old English word\n    print(\"Step 2: The Native Old English Word\")\n    explanation2 = \"\"\"\\\n    The original word for sister in Old English was 'sweostor'. This word is part\n    of the common Germanic heritage, with cognates like 'Schwester' in German\n    and 'zuster' in Dutch.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation2))\n\n    # Step 3: Trace the hypothetical evolution\n    print(\"Step 3: How 'sweostor' Would Have Evolved\")\n    explanation3 = \"\"\"\\\n    Without Norse influence, 'sweostor' would have undergone natural sound changes:\n    - The 'w' sound would likely have been lost, as seen in 'sword' (from 'sweord').\n    - The 'eo' vowel combination would have simplified.\n    - In many dialects, 'sweostor' became 'suster' in Middle English. This form\n      was common and used by writers like Chaucer.\n    - The vowel 'u' in 'suster' (pronounced like the 'u' in 'put') would have\n      naturally evolved into the modern 'uh' sound (like the 'u' in 'cup').\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation3))\n\n    # Step 4: State the final conclusion\n    print(\"Step 4: The Resulting Modern English Word\")\n    final_word = \"suster\"\n    explanation4 = f\"\"\"\\\n    Following this linguistic path, the Middle English 'suster' would have\n    become the Modern English word '{final_word}'. It would be pronounced\n    to rhyme with 'duster' or 'cluster'.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation4))\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The hypothetical Modern English word is: {final_word}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
