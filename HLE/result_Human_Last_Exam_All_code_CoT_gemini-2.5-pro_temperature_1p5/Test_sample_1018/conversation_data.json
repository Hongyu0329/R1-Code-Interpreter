    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects**: We are asked for the simplicial volume of a product manifold, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. I need to understand what these objects are. $\\Sigma_g$ denotes a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$.\n2.  **Recall the relevant theorem**: The computation does not require a complex numerical calculation. Instead, it relies on a fundamental theorem about the simplicial volume of product manifolds. A key result by M. Gromov states that the simplicial volume of a product of two closed, connected, oriented manifolds of positive dimension is zero.\n3.  **Apply the theorem**: I will verify that our specific manifolds, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, meet the conditions of this theorem.\n    *   Is $\\Sigma_{31}$ a closed, connected, oriented manifold of positive dimension? Yes, it is a 2-dimensional manifold.\n    *   Is $\\Sigma_{17}$ a closed, connected, oriented manifold of positive dimension? Yes, it is also a 2-dimensional manifold.\n    *   Since both manifolds satisfy the conditions, their product's simplicial volume must be zero.\n4.  **Construct the Python code**: I will write a Python script that states this reasoning and prints the final equation, clearly displaying the numbers from the problem and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_of_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of a product of two closed oriented surfaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genera of the two surfaces\n    g1 = 31\n    g2 = 17\n\n    print(\"Problem: Compute the simplicial volume of Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}, where g1 = {g1} and g2 = {g2}.\".format(g1=g1, g2=g2))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Explanation of the theory\n    print(\"Background Theory:\")\n    print(\"The simplicial volume of a manifold is a topological invariant.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental theorem by Gromov addresses the simplicial volume of product manifolds.\")\n    print(\"Theorem: For any two closed, connected, oriented manifolds M and N of positive dimension,\")\n    print(\"the simplicial volume of their product, ||M x N||, is zero.\")\n    print(\"\\nApplying the theorem to our case:\")\n    print(\"1.
