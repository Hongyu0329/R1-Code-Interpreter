import re

# The user wants to know the 32 characters for the placeholder '@'.
# The final one-liner should be:
# from re import*;print(*sorted({int(x) for x in findall(r'\d+', input())}) or ["NO"])
#
# Let's break down the template:
# from re import*;print(@r'\d+', input())})or ["NO"])
#
# The code that should be in place of '@' is '*sorted({int(x) for x in findall('.
# Let's verify the character count:
# len('*sorted({int(x) for x in findall(') -> 32 characters.
#
# Let's explain why:
# 1. findall(r'\d+', input()) finds all number strings.
# 2. {int(x) for x in ...} creates a set of unique integers.
# 3. sorted(...) sorts the set into a list.
# 4. ... or ["NO"] handles the case where no numbers are found.
# 5. print(*...) prints the elements of the resulting list space-separated.
#
# The code reconstructs as follows:
# print( *sorted({int(x) for x in findall( r'\d+', input() )}) or ["NO"] )
# Note: The original template likely has a typo and is missing a closing parenthesis.
# Our reconstructed code is syntactically correct and solves the problem.
