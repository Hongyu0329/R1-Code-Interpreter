The conditions for functions F, G, and H to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are: 1. The domains X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces. 2. The functions F, G, and H satisfy a system of contraction-type inequalities with respect to the metrics of the spaces. 3. The coefficients of these inequalities must combine to ensure the overall mapping on the product space X*Y*Z is a contraction, for example, by having a condition like `max((a1 + b2 + c3), (b1 + a2 + b3), (c1 + a3)) < 1`, where the coefficients are from the aforementioned inequalities.
