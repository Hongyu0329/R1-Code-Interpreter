# Plan:
# The problem asks for the limit of a conditional probability for a simple random walk (SRW) on a 2D torus.
# Let P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B), where A is the event "x0 was not visited" and B is "0 was not visited".
# 1. Identify the key parameters from the problem description.
#    - The graph is a 2D torus, which is a d-regular graph. For a simple random walk, each vertex has 4 neighbors, so the degree is d=4.
#    - The vertex x0 has exactly k common neighbors with the vertex 0. The problem states k=2.
# 2. Model the effect of conditioning.
#    - Conditioning on the rare event of not visiting vertex 0 for a very long time alters the behavior of the walk, especially near 0.
#    - When the walk is at a neighbor of 0, say v, it's forbidden from jumping to 0.
#    - So, instead of d choices, the walker at v has d-1 available choices.
#    - In the conditioned process, the walker at v jumps to any of its d-1 non-0 neighbors with equal probability 1/(d-1).
# 3. Analyze the probability from a common neighbor.
#    - Let v be a common neighbor of both 0 and x0.
#    - In the conditioned process, the walk at v has d-1 possible next steps. One of these is x0.
#    - The probability of the walk at v NOT jumping to x0 is ( (d-1) - 1 ) / (d-1) = (d-2)/(d-1).
# 4. Combine the effects from all common neighbors.
#    - The problem states there are k=2 common neighbors. These represent k "channels" of interaction.
#    - A standard heuristic for such problems is that these channels contribute independently to the probability.
#    - Therefore, the final probability is the product of the probabilities from each channel.
#    - This results in the formula: ((d-2)/(d-1))^k.
# 5. Substitute the values and compute the result.
#    - d = 4
#    - k = 2
#    - P = ((4-2)/(4-1))^2 = (2/3)^2 = 4/9.
#

d = 4  # Degree of a vertex in the 2D torus
k = 2  # Number of common neighbors between 0 and x0
