    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose container, such as an ampule, is determined by standards set to ensure sterility and stability. The primary reference for this in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>.\n\nMy plan is to provide the answer based on these guidelines. I will then create a Python script to demonstrate this rule. The script will:\n1.  Define the BUD in hours as per the USP <797> guideline for a single-dose container opened in a sterile environment.\n2.  Use the current time as an example of when the ampule is punctured.\n3.  Calculate the expiration time by adding the BUD to the puncture time.\n4.  Print a clear explanation of the rule and the calculated example.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef calculate_bud_single_dose_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    punctured in a sterile environment, based on USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to USP <797>, the BUD for a single-dose container (like an ampule)\n    # punctured or opened in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment is 12 hours.\n    bud_in_hours = 12\n\n    # Get the current time to simulate the moment of puncture.\n    puncture_time = datetime.datetime.now()\n\n    # Calculate the exact expiration time.\n    expiration_time = puncture_time + datetime.timedelta(hours=bud_in_hours)\n\n    # --- Outputting the results ---\n    print(\"Based on USP <797> guidelines for a sterile (ISO Class 5 or cleaner) environment:\")\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule is {bud_in_hours} hours after puncture.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Example Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Time of Puncture : {puncture_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}\")\n    print(f\"BUD Duration     : + {bud_in_hours} hours\")\n    print(f\"Must Be Used By  : {expiration_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_bud_single_dose_ampule()\n```\n<<<12 hours>>>"
