def analyze_rar_mutants():
    """
    Analyzes the relationship between RAR mutant properties.

    This function evaluates the provided multiple-choice options based on the known
    molecular biology of nuclear receptors like the Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR).

    RAR Structure and Function:
    1.  Domain Structure: RARs have distinct domains, most notably a DNA-Binding Domain (DBD)
        and a Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD). These domains are structurally and functionally modular.
    2.  DNA Binding: The DBD is responsible for recognizing and binding to specific DNA
        sequences (RAREs - Retinoic Acid Response Elements).
    3.  Ligand Binding: The LBD binds to the ligand, retinoic acid (RA).
    4.  Transcriptional Activation: This is the ultimate function. It requires both the DBD
        to be bound to DNA and the LBD to be bound to RA. RA binding causes a
        conformational change that allows the receptor to recruit coactivators and initiate
        transcription. A failure in either DNA binding or RA binding will disrupt
        transcriptional activation.

    print("Analysis of Answer Choices:")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Choice A Analysis
    print("Choice A: RAR mutants with insertions at sites g and h disrupt transcriptional activation but retain DNA binding.")
    print("  - Rationale: This is a highly plausible scenario. If mutations (insertions) occur within the Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD), they would likely abolish or reduce RA binding or the ability to interact with co-activators. This would disrupt transcriptional activation.")
    print("  - Since the DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) is a separate, modular unit, its function (binding to DNA) would likely be unaffected.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This statement accurately describes the expected outcome for mutations specifically targeting the LBD.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Choice B Analysis
    print("Choice B: Mutants c, d, and e demonstrate identical effects on RA binding, yet differ significantly in DNA binding ability.")
    print("  - Rationale: If these mutants have identical effects on RA binding, they are likely located in the LBD. It is unlikely that mutations within the LBD would cause *significant differences* in the function of the distant DBD.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This statement is less plausible.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Choice C Analysis
    print("Choice C: Insertions at k and l lead to loss of RA binding and DNA binding, thus affecting transcriptional activation.")
    print("  - Rationale: This is possible if the mutation causes a global misfolding of the entire protein, affecting all domains. However, it's a less specific outcome than that described in A.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Plausible, but less precise and universally applicable than A.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Choice D Analysis
    print("Choice D: All mutants that are defective in RA binding are also defective in both DNA binding and transcriptional activation, indicating a linked mechanism.")
    print("  - Rationale: This statement is incorrect. It contradicts the principle of modular protein domains. It is a classic finding that the LBD and DBD functions are separable. A mutant can lose RA binding while still being able to bind to DNA.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This statement is fundamentally flawed.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Choice E Analysis
    print("Choice E: Mutants f through m uniformly exhibit enhanced RA binding compared to wild-type, despite varying effects on transcriptional activation.")
    print("  - Rationale: Random mutations are far more likely to be deleterious or neutral than to enhance function. It is extremely improbable that a large set of different mutants would 'uniformly exhibit enhanced' binding.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This is highly unlikely.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("Final Decision:")
    print("Choice A describes the most accurate and common experimental observation for mutations in modular proteins like nuclear receptors. It correctly identifies that transcriptional activation can be lost due to a defect in the LBD, while the function of the separate DBD (DNA binding) is retained.")
