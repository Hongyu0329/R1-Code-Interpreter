    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Rephrase the Problem:** The core of the problem is to find the maximum number of queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board without any attacking each other. The colors are irrelevant to the placement constraints; a white queen attacks a black queen just as it would another white queen. Therefore, placing `m` white and `m` black queens is equivalent to placing a total of `2m` queens of a single color.\n\n2.  **Determine the Theoretical Maximum:** For an NÃ—N chessboard, you cannot place more than N non-attacking queens. If you were to place N+1 queens, the pigeonhole principle guarantees that at least two queens must share the same row, and thus they would attack each other. For a 16x16 board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is 16.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equation:** Based on the above, the total number of queens, `2m`, must be less than or equal to 16. To find the maximum `m`, we set `2m = 16`.\n\n4.  **Verify with Code:** I will write a Python script to confirm that it is indeed possible to place 16 non-attacking queens on a 16x16 board. The script will use an efficient backtracking algorithm to find a valid solution for the 16-Queens problem. This confirms that the theoretical maximum is achievable.\n\n5.  **Calculate and Conclude:** Finally, the script will solve the equation `2m = 16` for `m` and print a step-by-step explanation, the final answer, and the complete equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white and m black queens\n    can coexist on a 16x16 board without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 16\n\n    class NQueensSolver:\n        \"\"\"\n        An efficient N-Queens solver using backtracking with boolean arrays for O(1) safety checks.\n        \"\"\"\n        def __init__(self, size):\n            self.n = size\n            self.solution = None\n            self.board = [-1] * self.n\n            self.col_used = [False] * self.n\n            # For primary diagonals, row + col is constant.
