    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the definitions of an isometric embedding and a Banach space. The key is to understand how the choice of the space $X$ and the space $B$ affects the total number of possible embeddings.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, we'll analyze the definition of an isometric embedding, which is a function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d_X(x, y)$. We'll see how the properties of the Banach space $B$ affect the number of these functions.\n2.  We will show that if $B$ is any non-trivial Banach space (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^n$), the number of isometric embeddings for any embeddable space $X$ is infinite, due to translational symmetry in $B$.\n3.  To find a finite number of embeddings, we must consider the only possible edge case for a Banach space: the trivial space $B = \\{0\\}$.\n4.  We will then determine the necessary property of the finite ultrametric space $X$ that allows it to be isometrically embedded into $B=\\{0\\}$.\n5.  Finally, by choosing the specific $X$ and $B$ that satisfy these conditions, we will count the number of embeddings and demonstrate that this count represents the smallest possible number, as embeddings are always guaranteed to exist.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by reasoning about the properties of isometric embeddings\n    and Banach spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the number of embeddings into a general Banach space.\")\n    print(\"An isometric embedding is a function f: X -> B such that ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y).\")\n    print(\"Let's assume we found one such embedding, f, into a non-trivial Banach space B (i.e., B is not just {0}).\")\n    print(\"A non-trivial Banach space contains infinitely many vectors.\")\n    print(\"For any vector v in B, we can define a new function g(x) = f(x) + v.\")\n    print(\"Let's check if g is also an isometric embedding:\")\n    print(\"||g(x) - g(y)|| = ||(f(x) + v) - (f(y) + v)|| = ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y).\")\n    print(\"So, g is also an isometric embedding.
