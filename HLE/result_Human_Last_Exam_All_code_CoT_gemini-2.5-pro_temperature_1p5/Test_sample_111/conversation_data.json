    "My plan is to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death by using historical data.\n\n1.  **Identify the date of death:** First, I will establish the year Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records show this was in 1368.\n2.  **Establish Chaucer's timeline:** I will then review known facts about Chaucer's life and travels around that period.\n    *   Chaucer served in the English army in France but was captured and ransomed in 1360, returning to England afterward.\n    *   He entered the royal service of King Edward III as an esquire, and records show him receiving a pension for his service from 1367 onwards. This strongly places him in England.\n    *   His first major diplomatic journey abroad after this period was to Italy, which took place later, in 1372.\n    *   He wrote his first major poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" as an elegy for Blanche, at the request of his patron, John of Gaunt (Blanche's husband). This was written in England shortly after her death.\n3.  **Synthesize the data:** Based on this timeline, Chaucer's service in France was over, and his travels to Italy had not yet begun. His employment and literary work place him squarely in England in 1368.\n4.  **Code implementation:** I will write a Python script that encodes these key dates and facts into variables. The script will use logical steps to arrive at the most probable location and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chaucer_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key historical dates and facts\n    year_blanche_died = 1368\n    year_chaucer_return_from_france = 1360\n    year_chaucer_receives_pension_in_england = 1367\n    year_chaucer_first_italian_mission = 1372\n\n    # Logic to determine location\n    # We check if the year of Blanche's death falls between Chaucer's return to England\n    # and his first major mission to Italy.\n    if year_chaucer_return_from_france < year_blanche_died < year_chaucer_first_italian_mission:\n        # Records, like the start of his royal pension in 1367, confirm his presence in England.\n        location = \"England\"\n        correct_choice = \"C\"\n\n        print(\"Here is the logical breakdown based on historical dates:\")\n        # The prompt asks to output numbers from an equation.\n        # We will create a \"logical equation\" using the years.\n        print(f\"Fact 1: Blanche of Lancaster died in the year {year_blanche_died}.\")\n        print(f\"Fact 2: Chaucer was serving in the English royal court since at least {year_chaucer_receives_pension_in_england}.\")\n        print(f\"Fact 3: His first major trip to Italy was not until {year_chaucer_first_italian_mission}.\")\n        print(f\"\\nConclusion: Since {year_chaucer_receives_pension_in_england} < {year_blanche_died} < {year_chaucer_first_italian_mission}, Chaucer was in {location} when Blanche died.\")\n        print(f\"The correct answer choice is {correct_choice}.\")\n\n    else:\n        # This path is not expected based on historical data.\n        location = \"Unknown\"\n        correct_choice = \"D\"\n        print(f\"Based on the available data, the location is {location}.\")\n        print(f\"The correct answer choice is {correct_choice}.\")\n\nsolve_chaucer_location()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
