# The problem is to find the coefficients c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5 in the expression for the
# number of closed tree-like walks of length 6.

# Let W be the number of such walks. The expression is:
# W = c_1*e + c_2*k + c_3*p + c_4*Sum(deg(v) choose 2) + c_5*Sum(deg(v) choose 3)

# Based on combinatorial counting for each possible underlying tree structure of the walk,
# we determine the coefficients.

# c_1 corresponds to walks on a P_2 (single edge) subgraph.
# The edge must be traversed 6 times (e.g., u-v-u-v-u-v-u). There are 2 such walks for each edge.
c1 = 2

# c_2 corresponds to walks on a K_3 (triangle) subgraph.
# A tree-like walk's distinct edges must form a tree. K_3 is a cycle. So no such walks are counted here.
c2 = 0

# c_3 corresponds to walks on a P_4 (path on 4 vertices) subgraph.
# The 3 edges are traversed twice each. There are 6 such walks for each P_4.
c3 = 6

# c_4 corresponds to walks on a P_3 (path on 3 vertices) subgraph.
# The 2 edges are traversed with multiplicities (4,2) or (2,4). There are 12 such walks for each P_3.
c4 = 12

# c_5 corresponds to walks on a K_1,3 (star) subgraph.
# The 3 edges are traversed twice each. There are 12 such walks for each K_1,3.
c5 = 12

# We are asked to write the coefficients in order.
# The following print statement will output the coefficients.
