    "To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that can enclose the given parametric curve. This is often called the \"bounding box\". The side length of the smallest square that can outcircle the figure will be the larger of the width and height of this bounding box.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the curve in two parts:** The curve's definition changes based on the value of the parameter `t`. We will analyze the range of x and y coordinates for each part.\n    *   **Part 1: $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**: The curve is $x = \\cos(t)$, $y = \\sin(t)$. This is the upper semi-circle of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n    *   **Part 2: $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**: The curve is $x = \\cos(t)$, $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n\n2.  **Determine the overall bounding box:** We will find the overall minimum and maximum values for x and y by combining the ranges from both parts.\n    *   $x_{min}$ will be the minimum of all possible x values.\n    *   $x_{max}$ will be the maximum of all possible x values.\n    *   $y_{min}$ will be the minimum of all possible y values.\n    *   $y_{max}$ will be the maximum of all possible y values.\n\n3.  **Calculate the dimensions:** The width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min}$ and the height is $H = y_{max} - y_{min}$.\n\n4.  **Find the side of the enclosing square:** The side length `S` of the smallest square that can enclose the figure is the maximum of its width and height, i.e., $S = \\max(W, H)$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the area:** The area of this square is simply $S^2$.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given parametric curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For t in [0, pi]: x = cos(t), y = sin(t)\n    # Range of x is [cos(pi), cos(0)] = [-1, 1]\n    # Range of y is [sin(0 or pi), sin(pi/2)] = [0, 1]\n    x_min_1 = -1\n    x_max_1 = 1\n    y_min_1 = 0\n    y_max_1 = 1\n\n    # For t in (pi, 2*pi): x = cos(t), y = 5*sin(t)\n    # Range of x is [cos(pi), cos(2*pi)] = [-1, 1]\n    # Range of y is [5*sin(3*pi/2), 5*sin(pi or 2*pi)] = [-5, 0]\n    x_min_2 = -1\n    x_max_2 = 1\n    y_min_2 = -5\n    y_max_2 = 0\n\n    # Overall min and max values\n    x_min = min(x_min_1, x_min_2)\n    x_max = max(x_max_1, x_max_2)\n    y_min = min(y_min_1, y_min_2)\n    y_max = max(y_max_1, y_max_2)\n    \n    print(f\"The figure spans from x={x_min} to x={x_max}.\")\n    print(f\"The figure spans from y={y_min} to y={y_max}.\")\n\n    # Calculate the width and height of the bounding box\n    width = x_max - x_min\n    height = y_max - y_min\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe width of the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\n    print(f\"The height of the figure is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\n\n    # The side of the smallest enclosing square is the max of width and height\n    side_length = max(width, height)\n    print(f\"\\nThe side length of the smallest enclosing square is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.\")\n\n    # Calculate the area of the square\n    area = side_length * side_length\n    print(f\"\\nThe area of the square is {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}.\")\n\nsolve_area()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
