# Based on the detailed reasoning, we select plausible, hypothetical values for n_2 and n_3
# as the problem statement contains contradictions that make a direct derivation impossible.
# The selected values are based on the vertex counts of well-known combinatorial objects that
# approximate the described properties.

# Let n_2 be the smallest possible value of n for the 2-planar graph G.
# Let's hypothesize n_2 = 20, a common number in polyhedral combinatorics.
n_2 = 20

# Let n_3 be the smallest possible value of n for the 3-planar graph G_3.
# The line graph of the Dodecahedron is a 4-regular, 3-partite graph on 30 vertices.
# This is a strong candidate for the structural type, so we hypothesize n_3 = 30.
n_3 = 30

# The problem asks to calculate (n_2 + n_3) * n_2
result = (n_2 + n_3) * n_2

# Print the final equation with each number.
sum_val = n_2 + n_3
print(f"({n_2} + {n_3}) * {n_2} = {sum_val} * {n_2} = {result}")
