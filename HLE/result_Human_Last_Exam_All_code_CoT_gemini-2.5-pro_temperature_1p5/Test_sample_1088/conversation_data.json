    "To answer this question, we first need to understand what the `6-311G**` notation means and how it translates to the number of primitive Gaussian functions. The number of these functions is not a single constant; it depends on the specific atom. Therefore, to find the total for a molecule, we must sum the contributions from each of its constituent atoms.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the `6-311G**` notation** to determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs) for different types of atoms (e.g., Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen).\n    *   **6-311G**: This is a split-valence basis set.\n        *   **Core orbitals**: Described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF) made from **6** PGFs.\n        *   **Valence orbitals**: Described by three CGFs. The first is made of **3** PGFs, the second of **1** PGF, and the third of **1** PGF.\n    *   **\\*\\***: These are polarization functions.\n        *   The first `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions (composed of 6 Cartesian functions) to every non-hydrogen (heavy) atom. Each is a single PGF.\n        *   The second `*` adds a set of p-type polarization functions (composed of 3 functions) to every hydrogen atom. Each is a single PGF.\n2.  **Calculate the PGFs per atom**:\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: It has one valence orbital (1s). The PGF count is (3+1+1) for the valence s-orbital + 3 for the p-polarization functions = **8 PGFs**.\n    *   **2nd Row Heavy Atoms (e.g., C, N, O)**: They have one core orbital (1s) and four valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz). The PGF count is 6 for the core + 4*(3+1+1) for the valence orbitals + 6 for d-polarization functions = 6 + 20 + 6 = **32 PGFs**.\n3.  **Create a Python Script**: The script will calculate the total number of PGFs for a given molecule (I will use water, H₂O, as a clear example) by parsing its formula and summing the PGFs for each atom.\n4.  **Print the final equation**: The script will output the full calculation, showing the number of atoms of each type multiplied by their respective PGF count, and the final sum, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation for H₂O.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_total_primitives(formula):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of primitive Gaussian functions for a given\n    molecule using the 6-311G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping atomic symbols to their PGF count in a 6-311G** basis set.\n    # Counts are based on standard definitions used in computational chemistry packages.\n    pgf_counts = {\n        # Row 1\n        'H': 8, 'He': 5,\n        # Row 2\n        'Li': 17, 'Be': 17,\n        'B': 32, 'C': 32, 'N': 32, 'O': 32, 'F': 32, 'Ne': 32,\n        # Row 3 (use more complex, accurate counts)\n        'Na': 45, 'Mg': 45, 'Al': 45, 'Si': 45, 'P': 45, 'S': 45, 'Cl': 45, 'Ar': 45,\n    }\n\n    # Regex to parse chemical formulas e.g., H2O, C6H12O6\n    atom_pattern = re.compile(r'([A-Z][a-z]?)(\\d*)')\n    \n    # Parse the formula string and consolidate atom counts\n    try:\n        atom_list = atom_pattern.findall(formula)\n        if not atom_list or ''.join([symbol + (count or '1') for symbol, count in atom_list]) != formula:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid chemical formula format.\")\n        \n        parsed_atoms = {}\n        for symbol, count_str in atom_list:\n            if symbol not in pgf_counts:\n                print(f\"Error: Atom '{symbol}' is not supported in this script.\")\n                return\n            count = int(count_str) if count_str else 1\n            parsed_atoms[symbol] = parsed_atoms.get(symbol, 0) + count\n    except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n        print(f\"Could not parse formula '{formula}': {e}\")\n        return\n\n    total_primitives = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    # Sort atoms alphabetically for consistent output order\n    for symbol in sorted(parsed_atoms.keys()):\n        count = parsed_atoms[symbol]\n        primitives_per_atom = pgf_counts[symbol]\n        total_primitives += count * primitives_per_atom\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{count} * {primitives_per_atom}\")\n        \n    print(f\"Calculation for 6-311G** primitives in {formula}:\")\n    print(f\"The total is the sum of (atom count * primitives per atom).\")\n    # This line prints the final equation with all numbers.\n    print(f\"Equation: {' + '.join(equation_parts)} = {total_primitives}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of primitive Gaussians for {formula} is {total_primitives}.\")\n    \n    return total_primitives\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n# We will calculate the number of primitives for a water molecule (H2O) as an example.\n# The result for just H2O will be returned as the final answer.\nfinal_answer = calculate_total_primitives(\"H2O\")\n\n# The final answer will be printed in the special format below.\n# print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```\n<<<48>>>"
