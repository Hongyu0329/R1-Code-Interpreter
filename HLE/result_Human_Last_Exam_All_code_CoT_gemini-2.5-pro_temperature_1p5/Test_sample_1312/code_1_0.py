    print("  1. Redundancy: Having multiple gene copies means if one breaks due to mutation, others can still function, providing a safety net.")
    print("  2. Gene Conversion: More importantly, the genome can use the sequence of one gene copy as a template to 'repair' a mutated copy. This process, called gene conversion, actively removes bad mutations from the family. It is a well-studied mechanism for preserving genes on non-recombining Y chromosomes.")
    
    print(f"Option E ({options['E']}): This provides redundancy by having whole extra sets of chromosomes, which helps mask bad mutations. However, gene conversion within multigene families (Option D) is a more specific and active *architectural* mechanism for *purging* mutations, rather than just masking them.")
    
    print(f"Options A and C ({options['A']} and {options['C']}): These are sources of mutation and variation, but are not considered primary, structured mechanisms for compensating against genome-wide decay.")

    print("Conclusion: Multigene families provide a built-in system (gene conversion) that mimics the corrective power of recombination, thus serving as a key compensatory mechanism.")
