    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the number of times Otchumyelov's coat is described.\n\nFirst, I need to obtain the text of Anton Chekhov's short story, \"The Chameleon.\" I will then read through the story to identify all the distinct moments where the superintendent, Otchumyelov, interacts with his coat or where the coat is described. These actions are symbolic of his shifting mentality. The key phrases I will look for are related to him putting the coat on, taking it off, or other direct descriptions.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform this analysis. The script will:\n1.  Store the full text of the story in a string variable.\n2.  Define a list of specific, unique phrases that describe the coat or Otchumyelov's actions with it.\n3.  Count the occurrences of each of these phrases within the text.\n4.  Sum these counts to get the total number of descriptions.\n5.  Finally, print the equation showing how the total was calculated, followed by the result.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes \"The Chameleon\" to count descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Full text of \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekhov (translated by Constance Garnett)\n    text = \"\"\"\n    The police superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. A red-haired policeman strides after him with a sieve full of confiscated gooseberries in his hands. There is silence all around. Not a soul in the square. . . . The open doors of the shops and taverns look out upon God's world disconsolately, like hungry mouths; there is not even a beggar near them.\n    \"So you bite, you damned brute?\" Otchumyelov hears suddenly. \"Lads, don't let him go! Biting is prohibited nowadays! Hold him! ah . . . ah!\"\n    There is the sound of a dog yelping. Otchumyelov looks in the direction of the sound and sees a dog, hopping on three legs and looking about her, run out of Pitchugin's timber-yard. A man in a starched cotton shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing her. He runs after her, and throwing his body forward falls down and seizes the dog by her hind legs. The sound of yelping is heard again, and a shout of \"Don't let go!\" Sleepy countenances are protruded from the shops, and soon a crowd, which seems to have sprung out of the earth, is gathered round the timber-yard.\n    \"It looks like a row, your honour . . .\" says the policeman.\n    Otchumyelov makes a half turn to the left and strides towards the crowd.\n    He sees the aforementioned man in the unbuttoned waistcoat standing close by the gate of the timber-yard, holding his right hand in the air and displaying a bleeding finger to the crowd. On his drunken face there is a look of terror, and his finger has the aspect of a flag of victory. Otchumyelov recognises in him Hryukin, the goldsmith. The culprit who has caused the sensation, a white borzoy puppy with a sharp muzzle and a yellow patch on her back, is sitting on the ground with her fore-paws outstretched in the middle of the crowd, trembling all over. There is an expression of misery and terror in her tearful eyes.\n    \"What's it all about?\" Otchumyelov inquires, pushing his way through the crowd. \"What are you here for? Why are you waving your finger . . . ? Who was it shouted?\"\n    \"I was walking along here, not interfering with anyone, your honour . . .\" Hryukin begins, coughing into his fist. \"I was talking about firewood with Mitry Mitritch, when this low brute, for no rhyme or reason, bit my finger. . . . You must excuse me, I am a working man. . . . Mine is a fine sort of work. I must have damages, for I shan't be able to use this finger for a week, may be. . . . It's not even the law, your honour, that one should put up with it from a beast. . . . If everyone is going to be bitten, life won't be worth living. . . .\"\n    \"H'm. . . . Very good,\" says Otchumyelov sternly, coughing and raising his eyebrows. \"Very good. . . . Whose dog is it? I won't let this pass! I'll teach them to let their dogs run all over the place! It's time these gentry were looked after, if they won't obey the regulations! When he's fined, the blackguard, I'll teach him what it means to keep dogs and such stray cattle! I'll give him a lesson! Yeldrin,\" says the superintendent, addressing the policeman, \"find out whose dog this is and draw up a report! And the dog must be strangled. Without delay! It's sure to be mad. . . . Whose dog is it, I ask?\"\n    \"I fancy it's General Zhigalov's,\" says someone in the crowd.\n    \"General Zhigalov's? H'm. . . . Help me off with my coat, Yeldrin . . . it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain. . . . There's one thing I can't make out, how it came to bite you?\" Otchumyelov says, turning to Hryukin. \"Surely it couldn't reach your finger. It's a little dog, and you are a great hulking fellow! You must have scratched your finger with a nail, and then the idea struck you to get damages for it. I know your sort! You devils!\"\n    \"He put a cigarette in her face, your honour, for a joke, and she snapped at him. . . . He is a nonsensical fellow, your honour!\"\n    \"You are lying! You didn't see, so why should you lie? His honour is a wise gentleman; he can see who is lying and who is telling the truth, as in God's sight. . . . And if I am lying, let the court decide. It's written in the law. . . . We are all equal nowadays. My own brother is in the police . . . let me tell you.\"\n    \"Don't argue!\"\n    \"No, that's not the General's dog,\" says the policeman, with profound conviction, \"the General has setters.\"\n    \"Are you sure?\"\n    \"Yes, your honour.\"\n    \"I know it, too. The General has valuable dogs, thoroughbred, and this is goodness knows what! No coat, no shape. . . . A low creature. And to keep a dog like that! . . . where's the sense of it. If a dog like that were to turn up in Petersburg or Moscow, do you know what would happen? They would not worry about the law, they would strangle it in a twinkling! You've been injured, Hryukin, and we can't let the matter drop. . . . We must give them a lesson! It is high time. . . .\"\n    \"Yet it may be the General's,\" says the policeman, thinking aloud. \"It's not written on its face. . . . I saw one like it the other day in his yard.\"\n    \"It is the General's, that's certain!\" says a voice in the crowd.\n    \"H'm. . . . Put on my coat, Yeldrin, my lad. . . . There's a wind getting up. . . . I am cold. . . . You take it to the General's, and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it. And tell them not to let it out into the street. . . . It may be a valuable dog, and if every swine goes sticking a cigar in its mouth, it will soon be ruined. A dog is a delicate animal. . . . And you, you blockhead, put your hand down! It's no use your displaying your silly finger. It's your own fault! . . .\"\n    \"Here comes the General's cook, ask him. . . . Hi, Prohor! Come here, my dear man! Look at this dog. . . . Is it one of yours?\"\n    \"What an idea! We have never had one like that.\"\n    \"There's no need to waste time asking,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's a stray dog! There's no need to waste time talking about it. . . . Since he says it's a stray dog, a stray dog it is. . . . It must be destroyed, that's all about it.\"\n    \"It is not our dog,\" Prohor goes on. \"It belongs to the General's brother, who came the other day. Our master does not care for borzoys. His brother does.\"\n    \"Do you mean to say his Excellency's brother is in town? Vladimir Ivanitch?\" cries Otchumyelov, and his whole face is irradiated with a smile of ecstatic tenderness. \"Well, I never! And I didn't know! Has he come on a visit?\"\n    \"Yes.\"\n    \"Well, I never. . . . He couldn't stay away from his brother. . . . And there I didn't know! So this is his dog? Delighted to hear it. . . . Take it. It's not a bad pup. . . . A lively creature. . . . Snapped at this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha. . . . Come, why are you shivering? Rrr. . . . Rrr. . . . The rogue's angry . . . a nice little pup.\"\n    Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the timber-yard with her. The crowd laughs at Hryukin.\n    \"I'll make you smart yet!\" Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping himself in his greatcoat, he goes on his way across the market square.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # These phrases capture the key symbolic moments involving the coat.\n    # Note: \"Help me off with my coat\" and \"Put on my coat\" are used instead of \"take off/put on\" to avoid ambiguity and match the text precisely.\n    phrases_to_find = [\n        \"wearing a new overcoat\",            # 1.
