    "To find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we will establish the presentation of the fundamental group of this 4-manifold.\n2.  Next, we will compute the abelianization of this group, which is its first homology group.\n3.  Then, we will find the minimal number of generators for this resulting abelian group.\n4.  Finally, this number provides a lower bound for the minimal number of generators of the original group. For many groups arising in this context in topology, this lower bound is in fact the correct number. We will assume this is the case here to arrive at the final answer.\n\nThe calculation itself is a matter of algebraic topology, so the Python code will serve to formalize and present the steps of this calculation clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the\n    double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the components of the problem based on knot theory.\n    # The base knot is the trefoil knot.
