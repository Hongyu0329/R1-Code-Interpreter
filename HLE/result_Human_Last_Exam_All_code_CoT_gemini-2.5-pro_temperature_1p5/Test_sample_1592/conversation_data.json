    "To find the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I'll get the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish.\n2.  Next, I'll identify the provinces and territories that share a border with Quebec: Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut.\n3.  For each of these bordering provinces/territories, I will select a representative location that is geographically close to Quebec.\n    *   For Ontario, Moosonee is a nearby town on the opposite side of James Bay.\n    *   For Nunavut, Akimiski Island lies within James Bay and is geographically close.\n    *   For Newfoundland and Labrador, Labrador City is a key town near the Quebec-Labrador border.\n    *   For New Brunswick, Edmundston is a city near the Quebec border.\n4.  I will then use the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, to find the distance from Waskaganish to each of these representative locations.\n5.  Finally, I'll compare these calculated distances to determine which province or territory is the closest.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points on Earth using the Haversine formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = 6371  # Radius of Earth in kilometers\n    \n    # Convert latitude and longitude from degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n    \n    # Differences in coordinates\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n    \n    # Haversine formula\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    distance = R * c\n    \n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the closest province/territory to Waskaganish, Quebec.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coordinates for Waskaganish, Quebec\n    waskaganish_coords = {\"name\": \"Waskaganish, QC\", \"lat\": 51.49, \"lon\": -78.76}\n\n    # Coordinates for representative points in neighboring provinces/territories\n    locations = {\n        \"Ontario\": {\"name\": \"Moosonee, ON\", \"lat\": 51.27, \"lon\": -80.64},\n        \"Nunavut\": {\"name\": \"Akimiski Island, NU\", \"lat\": 53.00, \"lon\": -81.33},\n        \"Newfoundland and Labrador\": {\"name\": \"Labrador City, NL\", \"lat\": 52.94, \"lon\": -66.91},\n        \"New Brunswick\": {\"name\": \"Edmundston, NB\", \"lat\": 47.37, \"lon\": -68.32}\n    }\n    \n    # Calculate distances and find the minimum\n    closest_province = None\n    min_distance = float('inf')\n\n    print(f\"Calculating distances from {waskaganish_coords['name']} ({waskaganish_coords['lat']}° N, {waskaganish_coords['lon']}° W):\\n\")\n\n    for province, coords in locations.items():\n        distance = haversine_distance(\n            waskaganish_coords['lat'], waskaganish_coords['lon'],\n            coords['lat'], coords['lon']\n        )\n        print(f\"Distance to {coords['name']}: {distance:.2f} km\")\n        \n        if distance < min_distance:\n            min_distance = distance\n            closest_province = province\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe closest province/territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_province}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<Ontario>>>"
