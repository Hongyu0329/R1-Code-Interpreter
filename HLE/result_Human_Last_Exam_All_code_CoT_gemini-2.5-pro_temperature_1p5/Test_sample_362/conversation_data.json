    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**: The first step is to correctly identify the chemical structures of the two reactants from their names.\n    *   **Aldehyde**: \"pivalaldehyde\" is the common name for 2,2-dimethylpropanal. Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`. The key reactive part is the carbonyl group (`C=O`).\n    *   **Wittig Reagent**: \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" is a phosphorus ylide. Breaking down the name:\n        *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane`: This is the `PPh₃` part.\n        *   `ethylidene`: This indicates a two-carbon chain double-bonded to the phosphorus, so `...-CH=PPh₃`.\n        *   `2-(2-chlorophenyl)`: This specifies a substituent on the second carbon of the ethylidene group. The structure is `(2-chlorophenyl)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism**: The Wittig reaction forms an alkene by reacting a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or ketone) with a phosphorus ylide. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and the `PPh₃` group of the ylide are replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`).\n\n3.  **Combine the Reactants**:\n    *   The fragment from the aldehyde, pivalaldehyde, is `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`.\n    *   The fragment from the ylide is `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`.\n    *   Connecting these two fragments at the double bond gives the product structure: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product**: The final step is to determine the correct IUPAC name for the resulting alkene.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons (a pentene).\n    *   To give the double bond the lowest possible number, we number the chain starting from the end closer to the `(2-chlorophenyl)` group.\n    *   This results in the name: `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: A Python script will be created to display this information clearly, presenting the full reaction equation including the reactants, the main organic product, and the byproduct (triphenylphosphine oxide).\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines and displays the product of a Wittig reaction\n    between pivalaldehyde and a specific phosphorus ylide.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
