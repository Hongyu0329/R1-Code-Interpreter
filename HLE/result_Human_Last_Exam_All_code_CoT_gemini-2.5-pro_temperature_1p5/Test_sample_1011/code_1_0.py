    This function explains and calculates the smallest possible number of accumulation points.
    
    Let U = {u_1, u_2, ...} be the set of ultrafilters.
    Let U' be the set of accumulation points of U.

    1. The set U is an infinite set within the compact Hausdorff space N*.
       Therefore, U must have at least one accumulation point. So |U'| >= 1.

    2. We want to find the minimum possible value for |U'|. We can achieve |U'| = 1
       by a specific construction. The construction relies on two known (but non-trivial)
       theorems from set theory and topology:
       
       a) There exists a sequence of distinct ultrafilters U = {u_1, u_2, ...} in N*
          that converges to a single point v in N*. For such a sequence, the set of
          accumulation points is {v}, so its size is 1.
          
       b) For any sequence of distinct ultrafilters {u_i}, one can construct a
          family of pairwise disjoint infinite sets {P_i} such that P_i is in u_i for each i.
          These sets can be extended to form a partition of N while preserving their
          membership in the respective ultrafilters.

    3. By combining these results, we can construct a set U and a partition P that satisfy
       the conditions of the problem, and for which the number of accumulation points is exactly 1.
       
    4. Since the number of accumulation points must be at least 1, and we have shown it can be 1,
       the smallest possible number is 1.
