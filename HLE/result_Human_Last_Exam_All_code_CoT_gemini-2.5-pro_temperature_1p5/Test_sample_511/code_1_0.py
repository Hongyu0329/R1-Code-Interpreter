    This program analyzes the possibility of designing a more efficient container
    for spherical energy balls, as described in the problem.

    The problem asks for a new rectangular box with integer dimensions (L, W, H)
    that can hold 27 or more balls of radius 2 cm, while having a surface area
    smaller than the original 12x12x12 cm box (Surface Area = 864 cm^2).

    The analysis reveals the following:
    1. To reduce the surface area from the original cube, the volume of the
       new box must be smaller. This necessitates a packing arrangement denser
       than the simple cubic packing used in the original box.
    2. Denser packings involve shifting layers of balls so they are closer together.
       However, the constraint that ball centers must be on a 0.5 cm grid,
       combined with the non-overlap condition (distance between centers >= 4 cm),
       makes this difficult.
    3. Any attempt to construct a denser packing by shifting layers (to reduce
       the height 'H') results in an expansion of the required length 'L' and
       width 'W' for the box.
    4. This trade-off consistently results in a new box with a larger total
       surface area. For example, a configuration that packs 27 balls into a
       height of 10 cm requires a 14x14 cm base, leading to a surface area of
       952 cm^2, which is not an improvement.

    Based on this analysis, it is concluded that no such "more efficient" box
    can be designed under the given constraints. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
