Let `α` and `β` be two distinct atomic formulas. The function `f` and the formula `C` are defined as follows:

The function `f` maps a natural number `w` to the formula:
$$ f(w) = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{w} \alpha $$
(where $\bigotimes_{i=1}^{0} \alpha$ is defined as the multiplicative unit, $1$).

The formula `C`, which depends on `m` and `b`, is:
$$ C(m, b) = \left(\bigotimes_{k=1}^{m} \left(\left(\bigotimes_{i=1}^{b} \alpha\right) \multimap \beta\right)\right) \multimap \left(\bigotimes_{k=1}^{m} \beta\right) $$
