    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Key Terms**\n    *   **Continuum:** A continuum is a non-empty, compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The problem specifies \"not necessarily metric,\" so we must use this general definition and not assume the space has a metric.\n    *   **Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum of a continuum `X` is a subset of `X` which is itself a continuum (i.e., it is closed and connected). A *proper* subcontinuum is one that is not equal to `X`.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is called indecomposable if it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Composant:** For any point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `x` in `X` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `x`. Essentially, `C(p)` is the union of all proper subcontinua that contain the point `p`.\n\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound for the Number of Composants**\n    *   A fundamental property of composants is that the set of all distinct composants of a continuum `X` forms a partition of `X`. This means they are pairwise disjoint, and their union is the entire space `X`.\n    *   Another key theorem concerns indecomposable continua: For any point `p` in an indecomposable continuum `X`, its composant `C(p)` is a *proper* subset of `X` (i.e., `C(p) â‰  X`).\n    *   Combining these two facts, an indecomposable continuum `X` must be the union of its composants, and since each composant is a proper subset, `X` must have more than one composant.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum must be at least **2**.\n\n3.  **Consider the Metric Case (as a point of contrast)**\n    *   It is a classic and important result in topology that if an indecomposable continuum is *metric*, then it must have uncountably many composants (specifically, `c`, the cardinality of the continuum).\n    *   This result often leads to confusion, but the problem's explicit clause \"not necessarily metric\" is a direct hint that this theorem might not apply and a different answer is expected.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Non-Metric Case**\n    *   The question now reduces to this: Can an indecomposable continuum have exactly 2 composants?\n    *   The proofs that establish uncountably many composants for the metric case rely heavily on properties of metric spaces (like the Baire Category Theorem in a specific formulation and theorems about the topological structure of composants being F-sigma but not G-delta). These proofs fail in the general non-metric setting.\n    *   This opens the door to the existence of non-metric indecomposable continua with a countable, and possibly finite, number of composants.\n    *   In fact, such continua have been constructed by topologists. A famous (though complex) example is outlined by J. L. Kelley in his influential textbook \"General Topology\". This example is a non-metric indecomposable continuum that is specifically constructed to have exactly **two** composants. Other constructions using inverse limits also yield similar results.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   From Step 2, we know the minimum number of composants must be at least 2.\n    *   From Step 4, we know that examples of indecomposable (non-metric) continua with exactly 2 composants exist.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The \"not necessarily metric\" clause is critical.** Without it, the answer would be uncountable.\n*   **The difference between decomposable and indecomposable continua.** A decomposable continuum can have a single composant (e.g., a line segment). For an indecomposable continuum, this is impossible.\n*   **Properties of composants in indecomposable spaces:** They are all dense, pairwise disjoint, and their union is the whole space.\n\nBy combining the lower bound with the existence of a continuum that achieves this bound, we can confidently determine the answer.\n\n<<<2>>>"
