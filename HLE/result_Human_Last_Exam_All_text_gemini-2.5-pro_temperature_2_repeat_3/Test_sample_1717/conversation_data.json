    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Find the Base Health of the Eye of Cthulhu:**\n    First, we need to know the boss's starting health. In Normal Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2,800.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Expert Mode Base Health:**\n    The problem specifies Expert Mode, which increases boss health. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its health is increased to 3,640 for a single player. This will be the base value for our multiplayer calculation.\n\n3.  **Understand Multiplayer Health Scaling in Expert Mode:**\n    In multiplayer, boss health scales up with the number of players. According to Terraria's source code for Expert Mode, the health of a boss is calculated using the following formula:\n    `Total Health = [Base Expert Health] * (1 + 0.35 * (Number of Players - 1))`\n    The factor `0.35` means that for each player beyond the first, the boss gains an additional 35% of its base Expert Mode health.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Health Equation for the Eye of Cthulhu:**\n    By substituting the Eye of Cthulhu's base Expert Mode health into the formula, we get:\n    `Health(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n    Where `N` is the number of players. We can simplify this equation:\n    `Health(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n    `Health(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n    `Health(N) = 2366 + 1274N`\n\n5.  **Evaluate for an \"Infinite Number of Players\":**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. Mathematically, if we let `N` approach infinity (`N → ∞`), the health `2366 + 1274N` would also approach infinity.\n\n6.  **Consider the Technical Limitations of the Game Engine:**\n    The crucial part of the question is the mention of \"the source code of the video game Terraria\". This directs us to consider the game's programming limitations. Health values in Terraria are stored in variables. The specific variable type used for an NPC's health (`NPC.lifeMax`) is a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. This value is 2^31 - 1.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum value the game can store for the boss's health is **2,147,483,647**.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Although the health scaling formula calculates an infinitely large number for infinite players, the game engine cannot represent a number larger than the maximum value of the data type it uses. Any calculated health that exceeds this value will be capped at this maximum. Therefore, the \"theoretical maximum health\" is not infinite but is limited by the largest value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Mode Specifics:** The health calculation is different for Normal, Expert, and Master modes. The analysis must stick to Expert Mode as requested.\n*   **Source Code Constraint:** The reference to the \"source code\" is key. It changes the problem from a pure mathematical limit question to one about computer architecture and data type limitations.\n*   **Data Type:** Identifying the correct data type (`int`) and its maximum value is essential to finding the correct answer.\n*   **Distinguishing Theoretical vs. Practical:** The term \"theoretical maximum\" in this context refers to the maximum possible value within the game's coded rules and limitations, not a mathematical abstraction.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
