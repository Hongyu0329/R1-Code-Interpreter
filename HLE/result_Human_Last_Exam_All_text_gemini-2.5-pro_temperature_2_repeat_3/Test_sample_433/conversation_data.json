    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Components of the Question:**\n    *   **Container Type:** \"Single dose container ampule\". This is a crucial detail. An ampule is a sealed glass container that, once broken open, cannot be resealed. It becomes an open system.\n    *   **Action:** \"Puncture\". For an ampule, this means breaking it open.\n    *   **Environment:** \"Sterile environment\". This typically refers to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench or biological safety cabinet.\n    *   **Question:** What is the Beyond-Use Date (BUD)?\n\n2.  **Consult Authoritative Guidelines:**\n    *   The primary source for sterile compounding standards in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically USP General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations\". This chapter defines BUDs based on the container type, environment, and risk of contamination.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Rules for Single-Dose Containers in USP <797>:**\n    *   USP <797> has very specific rules for handling single-dose containers to prevent microbial contamination. It makes a critical distinction between different types of single-dose containers, namely vials (with a resealable rubber stopper) and ampules (which are open systems).\n    *   **For a single-dose vial:** If punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment, its contents may be used for up to 12 hours, provided it remains within the ISO Class 5 environment.\n    *   **For a single-dose ampule:** The rule is different and more strict. Because an ampule cannot be resealed after being opened, its contents are directly exposed to the environment.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule for Ampules:**\n    *   The 2023 version of USP <797> states this distinction explicitly in Section 7 (\"Opened or Needle-Punctured Conventional Single-Dose Containers\"): *\"Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored and must be used immediately.\"*\n    *   This means that once an ampule is opened, it is not assigned a BUD for storage. The contents must be withdrawn and used for compounding or administration right away.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The BUD for an opened single-dose ampule is **immediate use**. It cannot be stored for any period, even if it was opened and maintained within a sterile ISO Class 5 environment. Any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be discarded immediately after the initial use.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ampule vs. Vial:** Do not confuse the rule for ampules with the 12-hour rule for single-dose *vials*. The key difference is the inability to reseal an ampule, which makes it an open system with a higher risk of contamination.\n*   **\"Immediate Use\" Definition:** This term implies that the compounding process and subsequent administration should proceed without any delay or storage.\n*   **Environment Does Not Grant Extension:** Unlike with a vial, keeping an opened ampule in a sterile environment does not extend its usability. The inherent risk of an open container overrides the environmental control for the purpose of storage.\n*   **Safety Practice:** Remember that when drawing medication from a glass ampule, a filter needle must be used to remove any potential glass shards. This filter needle must be replaced with a regular needle before injecting the medication into a patient or IV bag.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis derived from official USP <797> guidelines, the BUD for a single-dose ampule after opening is \"immediate use\". It must not be stored, and any unused contents must be discarded.\n\n<<<A single-dose ampule, once opened in any environment, must be used immediately. It cannot be stored, and any unused portion must be discarded. Therefore, it has no Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for storage.>>>"
