    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices\n$P1 = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $P2 = \\begin{pmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, we will use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nA polynomial matrix $D(s)$ is a greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of $P1(s)$ and $P2(s)$ if:\n1.  $D(s)$ is a common right divisor of $P1(s)$ and $P2(s)$. This means there exist polynomial matrices $Q1(s)$ and $Q2(s)$ such that $P1(s) = Q1(s)D(s)$ and $P2(s) = Q2(s)D(s)$.\n2.  Any other common right divisor $C(s)$ of $P1(s)$ and $P2(s)$ is a right divisor of $D(s)$. This means there exists a polynomial matrix $L(s)$ such that $D(s) = L(s)C(s)$.\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**Step 2: Set up the Euclidean Algorithm**\nThe standard method is to form a block matrix $M(s)$ by stacking $P1(s)$ and $P2(s)$, and then reduce it to a simpler form using elementary row operations. The elementary row operations for polynomial matrices are:\n1.  Interchanging two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nThe initial stacked matrix is:\n$M(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} P1(s) \\\\ P2(s) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s-1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nLet the rows be R1, R2, R3, and R4.\nR1 = $[s^2 + s, -s]$\nR2 = $[-s^2 - 1, s^2]$\nR3 = $[s, 0]$\nR4 = $[-s - 1, 1]$\n\nOur goal is to reduce this 4x2 matrix to the form $\\begin{pmatrix} D(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $D(s)$ is a 2x2 matrix that will be our GCRD.\n\n**Step 3: Perform Row Reduction**\nWe look for a row that can be used to simplify other rows. The degrees of the polynomials in the first column are 2, 2, 1, 1. We should work with the rows of lower degree. Notice that if we add R3 and R4, the 's' term in the first column will cancel.\n\n**Operation 1:** Replace R4 with R3 + R4.\nR4' = R3 + R4 = $[s, 0] + [-s - 1, 1] = [-1, 1]$.\nThis is a very useful row since its first element is a constant. The matrix becomes:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Operation 2:** Use the new R4' (let's call it the pivot row) to eliminate the first entry of the other rows.\n*   Replace R1 with R1 + (s^2 + s) * R4':\n    R1' = $[s^2+s, -s] + (s^2+s)[-1, 1] = [s^2+s - (s^2+s), -s + (s^2+s)] = [0, s^2]$.\n*   Replace R2 with R2 + (-s^2 - 1) * R4':\n    R2' = $[-s^2-1, s^2] + (-s^2-1)[-1, 1] = [-s^2-1 + s^2+1, s^2 - s^2-1] = [0, -1]$.\n*   Replace R3 with R3 + s * R4':\n    R3' = $[s, 0] + s[-1, 1] = [s - s, 0 + s] = [0, s]$.\n\nThe matrix is now row-equivalent to:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & s^2 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & s \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 4: Continue the Reduction**\nLet's reorder the rows to make the process clearer (this is an elementary operation).\n$\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & s \\\\ 0 & s^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we have a new pivot row, R2'' = `[0, -1]`. We use it to eliminate the second entry in the other rows.\n\n**Operation 3:**\n*   Replace R1'' with R1'' + R2'':\n    R1''' = $[-1, 1] + [0, -1] = [-1, 0]$.\n*   Replace R3'' with R3'' + s * R2'':\n    R3''' = $[0, s] + s[0, -1] = [0, s - s] = [0, 0]$.\n*   Replace R4'' with R4'' + s^2 * R2'':\n    R4''' = $[0, s^2] + s^2[0, -1] = [0, s^2 - s^2] = [0, 0]$.\n\nThe matrix is now:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 5: Final Normalization**\nFinally, we can multiply the first and second rows by -1 (a non-zero constant) to get the standard form.\n\n**Operation 4:**\n*   R1'''' = -1 * R1''' = `[1, 0]`\n*   R2'''' = -1 * R2'' = `[0, 1]`\n\nThe final reduced matrix is:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis is in the form $\\begin{pmatrix} D(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $D(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is the identity matrix $I_2$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the identity matrix. When the GCRD is the identity matrix, the matrices P1 and P2 are said to be right coprime.\n\nFinal Answer: The greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n$D(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$"
