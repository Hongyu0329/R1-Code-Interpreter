    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nThe question provides three key clues to identify a person (\"HE\"):\n1.  **HIS work:** The person is known for a specific, significant body of work. The phrase \"at the end of HIS work\" suggests this work has a clear structure and a concluding part.\n2.  **Addressing another's material possessions:** The concluding part of this work specifically deals with rules about desiring or taking someone else's property.\n3.  **Ignoring the prohibition against representation:** While addressing the issue of possessions, the person's method is interpreted as violating or ignoring a rule against making representations or images.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Prohibition Against Representation\"**\n\nThis is the most direct clue. This prohibition is most famously articulated in the Second Commandment of the Ten Commandments (also known as the Decalogue) found in the Old Testament books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The commandment explicitly forbids the making of \"graven images\" or any \"likeness\" of things in heaven, on earth, or in the sea.\n\n**Step 3: Connect to the \"Work\" and its \"End\"**\n\nIf the \"prohibition against representation\" is the Second Commandment, then \"HIS work\" is likely the Ten Commandments themselves, or the larger body of law they belong to (the Torah or Law). The figure \"HE\" would be the lawgiver who delivered this work. \"At the end of HIS work\" would refer to the final commandment in the sequence.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Commandment about \"Material Possessions\"**\n\nThe Tenth (and final) Commandment is the one that addresses \"another's material possessions.\" It reads: \"You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.\" This directly matches the second clue.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Clues with the Interpretation**\n\nNow we connect all the points using the interpretation provided in the question.\n*   The work is the Ten Commandments.\n*   The \"prohibition against representation\" is the Second Commandment.\n*   The final part dealing with possessions is the Tenth Commandment.\n*   The interpretation (by \"Veronika Campan\") is that the Tenth Commandment \"naturally ignores the prohibition against representation.\" How? By listing very specific, concrete, and visualizable possessions (house, wife, ox, donkey), the text compels the listener to create a mental *representation* or *image* of those objects of desire. This act of creating a mental list of desirable things runs counter to the spirit of the aniconic (anti-image) principle of the Second Commandment.\n\n**Step 6: Identify \"HE\"**\n\nThe central human figure who, according to Judeo-Christian tradition, received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai and delivered them to the people is the prophet **Moses**. Therefore, HE is Moses. His \"work\" in this context is the Law he brought down from the mountain. The question asks for HIS full name, which is simply Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
