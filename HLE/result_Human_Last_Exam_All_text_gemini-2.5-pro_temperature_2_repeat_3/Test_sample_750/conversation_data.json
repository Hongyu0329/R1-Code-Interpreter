    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Equation**\nThe equation to be solved is $z \\cdot i = i^z$, where $z$ is a complex number. The main difficulty lies in the term $i^z$, which represents a complex number raised to a complex power. This expression is multi-valued.\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Complex Power $i^z$**\nBy definition, for any complex numbers $a$ and $b$, $a^b = e^{b \\log(a)}$. The complex logarithm, $\\log(a)$, is a multi-valued function given by $\\log(a) = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $\\ln$ is the real natural logarithm and $\\arg(a)$ is the principal argument of $a$.\n\nFor $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and $\\arg(i) = \\pi/2$.\nTherefore, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\n\nTo find all solutions for $z$, we must consider every possible value of $\\log(i)$, which means we must solve the equation for every integer $k$.\nLet's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$.\nSo the equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{z \\cdot iC_k}$.\n\n**Step 3: Transforming the Equation**\nThe equation is $z \\cdot i = e^{izC_k}$. To simplify this, let's make a substitution.\nLet $w = z \\cdot i$.\nThis implies $z = w/i$. Since $1/i = -i$, we have $z = -wi$.\nSubstituting $w$ and $z$ into the equation gives:\n$w = e^{(-wi) \\cdot iC_k}$\n$w = e^{-w(i^2)C_k}$\n$w = e^{wC_k}$\n\nNow we need to solve the equation $w = e^{wC_k}$ for the complex variable $w$. The solutions will depend on the choice of the integer $k$.\n\n**Step 4: Solving for w using the Lambert W function**\nThe equation $w = e^{wC_k}$ can be solved using the Lambert W function, which is defined as the function $W(x)$ that satisfies $W(x) e^{W(x)} = x$. The Lambert W function is also multi-valued for a complex argument, denoted by branches $W_j(x)$ for $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTo put our equation into this form:\n$w = e^{wC_k}$\n$w e^{-wC_k} = 1$\nMultiply by $-C_k$:\n$(-wC_k) e^{(-wC_k)} = -C_k$\n\nLet $s = -wC_k$. The equation is now $s e^s = -C_k$.\nBy definition of the Lambert W function, the solutions for $s$ are:\n$s = W_j(-C_k)$ for any integer $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince $s = -wC_k$, we have $w = -s/C_k$.\nSo, the solutions for $w$ are:\n$w_{k,j} = -\\frac{W_j(-C_k)}{C_k}$ for all integers $k, j$.\n\n**Step 5: Solving for z**\nWe can now find the solutions for $z$ using the relation $z = -wi$.\n$z_{k,j} = -w_{k,j} \\cdot i = - \\left( -\\frac{W_j(-C_k)}{C_k} \\right) \\cdot i = i \\frac{W_j(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n\nSubstituting $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$, the general form of all solutions is:\n$z_{k,j} = i \\frac{W_j(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$ for all $k,j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 6: Analysis of the Solutions**\nWe can categorize the solutions based on the values of $k$ and $j$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The multi-valued nature of $i^z$ requires introducing an integer parameter $k$.\n*   The use of the Lambert W function introduces another integer parameter $j$ for its branches.\n*   The properties of the Lambert W function determine the nature of the solutions (real, purely imaginary, or complex). Specifically, for a real argument $x$, $W_0(x)$ is real if $x \\ge -1/e$, and $W_{-1}(x)$ is real if $x \\in [-1/e, 0)$. All other branches are complex-valued for a real argument.\n\n**1. Real Solutions ($z \\in \\mathbb{R}$)**\nLet's test simple real values.\n- If $z=1$: LHS = $1 \\cdot i = i$. RHS = $i^1 = i$. This is a solution.\n- If $z=-1$: LHS = $-1 \\cdot i = -i$. RHS = $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. This is also a solution.\nThese solutions can be found from the general formula. For any $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:\nFor $z=1$, $w=zi=i$. The equation $w=e^{wC_k}$ becomes $i=e^{iC_k}$, which is true because $C_k=\\pi/2+2k\\pi$.\nFor $z=-1$, $w=zi=-i$. The equation becomes $-i=e^{-iC_k}$, which is true because $\\cos(C_k)=0$ and $\\sin(C_k)=1$.\nThus, $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are solutions.\n\n**2. Purely Imaginary Solutions ($z=iy, y\\in\\mathbb{R}, y \\ne 0$)**\nFor $z$ to be purely imaginary, $w=zi=iy\\cdot i=-y$ must be real and non-zero.\nFor $w$ to be real, $w_{k,j} = -\\frac{W_j(-C_k)}{C_k}$ must be real. Since $C_k$ is real, $W_j(-C_k)$ must be real.\nThe argument of the W-function is $x=-C_k$. For $W_j(x)$ to be real, we must have $x \\ge -1/e$.\nSo, $-C_k \\ge -1/e \\implies C_k \\le 1/e$.\n$\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) \\le 1/e \\implies 1+4k \\le \\frac{2}{\\pi e} \\approx 0.234 \\implies 4k \\le -0.766 \\implies k \\le -0.1915$.\nSince $k$ must be an integer, this condition holds for all integers $k \\le -1$.\nFor these values of $k$, $-C_k = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) > 0$. When the argument $x$ is positive, only the principal branch $W_0(x)$ is real. Thus we must have $j=0$.\nSo, the purely imaginary solutions are given by:\n$z_{k,0} = i \\frac{W_0(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$ for all integers $k \\le -1$.\n\n**3. Other Complex Solutions**\nAll other pairs of integers $(k, j)$ result in solutions for $z$ that have both non-zero real and imaginary parts.\n*   For $k \\le -1$ and $j \\ne 0$: $W_j(-C_k)$ is complex because $-C_k>0$.\n*   For $k \\ge 0$: We have $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1/e$. So $-C_k < -1/e$. For a real argument $x < -1/e$, all branches $W_j(x)$ are complex. Therefore, for all $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $W_j(-C_k)$ is complex.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe set of all solutions $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ for the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ is given by:\n$z = i \\frac{W_j(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$\nfor all integers $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $W_j$ denotes the $j$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nThis general formula encompasses all types of solutions:\n1.  **Real solutions:** $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions:** An infinite set given by the formula above for $j=0$ and for all integers $k \\le -1$.\n3.  **Complex solutions** (non-real and non-purely imaginary): All other combinations of integers $k$ and $j$.\n\n<<<The set of all solutions for $z$ in the equation $z\\cdot i = i^z$ can be expressed using the branches of the Lambert W function, $W_j$. For any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ that specifies the branch of the logarithm of $i$, and for any integer $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ that specifies the branch of the Lambert W function, the solutions are given by:\n$z = i \\frac{W_j(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$\n\nThis set includes:\n1. The two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2. An infinite family of purely imaginary solutions, obtained when $j=0$ and $k$ is any integer less than or equal to -1.\n3. An infinite family of non-real complex solutions for all other pairs of integers $(k, j)$.>>>"
