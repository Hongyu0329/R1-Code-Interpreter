    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   The starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n*   Let's break down the structure:\n    *   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl-nitrogen group (-CONH-).\n    *   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. This makes the group -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n    *   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is attached to position 3 of the benzene ring (meta to the amide group).\n*   The structure contains two important functional groups attached to the benzene ring: the **N,N-diethylamide group** and the **dimethylamino group**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and Conditions of the First Step**\n\n*   The reagents are **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium)** and **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine)** in **THF (tetrahydrofuran)** solvent.\n*   **sec-BuLi**: This is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary function is to remove a proton (deprotonation) from the most acidic site in the molecule.\n*   **TMEDA**: This is a chelating ligand for the lithium ion (Li⁺). It complexes with the lithium ion, which increases the reactivity and basicity of the sec-butyl anion.\n*   **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)**: Certain functional groups on a benzene ring can direct a strong base like sec-BuLi to remove a proton from a specific position, usually the *ortho* position. This is because the heteroatoms (like O or N) in the directing group can coordinate to the lithium ion, bringing the base close to the ortho C-H bond. Both the N,N-diethylamide group and the dimethylamino group are powerful directing groups for ortho-metalation.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Reaction Site**\n\n*   We must determine which proton in the starting material is the most acidic and will be removed by sec-BuLi.\n*   There are no acidic N-H or O-H protons. The reaction will involve deprotonating a C-H bond.\n*   The N,N-diethylamide group at C1 directs lithiation to the *ortho* positions: C2 and C6.\n*   The dimethylamino group at C3 directs lithiation to its *ortho* positions: C2 and C4.\n*   **Cooperative Directing Effect**: The proton at the C2 position is *ortho* to **both** the amide and the dimethylamino directing groups. This synergistic effect makes the C2 proton exceptionally acidic compared to all other protons on the ring (C4, C5, and C6). The lithium ion can be chelated by both the carbonyl oxygen and the amine nitrogen, forming a very stable five-membered ring intermediate.\n*   Therefore, sec-BuLi will selectively remove the proton from the C2 position, forming a nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Step**\n\n*   The reagent added in the second step is **methyl iodide (CH₃I)**.\n*   Methyl iodide is a classic electrophile. The C-I bond is polarized, making the methyl carbon atom electron-deficient (δ⁺) and a good target for nucleophiles.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Final Product**\n\n*   The nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step will attack the electrophilic methyl carbon of methyl iodide.\n*   This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2-type). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group. The iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group.\n*   The final result is the substitution of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n*   The starting material was N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n*   The final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  Recognize the starting material possesses two powerful directing groups for ortho-metalation (-CONEt₂ and -NMe₂).\n2.  Understand that sec-BuLi/TMEDA is a reagent system specifically used for deprotonating relatively unreactive C-H bonds via DoM.\n3.  Identify the proton that is activated by both directing groups (the C2 proton) as the most acidic and the site of lithiation.\n4.  Recognize methyl iodide as a simple electrophile that will be attacked by the generated carbanion (aryllithium).\n5.  Combine these steps to deduce that the reaction is a selective methylation at the C2 position of the aromatic ring.\n\nThe compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
