    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the largest natural number `n` such that the $(2n)$th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is non-zero.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object of study.**\nWe are looking for the largest natural number $n \\ge 1$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$. Here, $K_i(R)$ denotes the $i$-th algebraic K-group of a ring $R$, as defined by Quillen. The ring in question is $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the K-group by its torsion parts.**\nThe K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/m$ are finite abelian groups. An abelian group is zero if and only if all of its $p$-primary components are zero for all primes $p$. So, we analyze the structure of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{p\\}$ for all primes $p$. The ring is $R = \\mathbb{Z}/p_0^k$ with $p_0=3$ and $k=3$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the K-groups away from the characteristic.**\nA fundamental result in algebraic K-theory, a consequence of the theorems by Suslin, Wodzicki, and McCarthy, states that for a nilpotent ideal extension $R \\to R/I$, the map of K-groups induces an isomorphism on torsion subgroups whose order is prime to the residue characteristic.\nLet $R = \\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ and $I=(p)$ be the maximal ideal. The residue field is $R/I = \\mathbb{Z}/p$. The residue characteristic is $p$. For any prime $\\ell \\neq p$, the relative K-groups $K_i(R, I)$ are known to have no $\\ell$-torsion. The long exact sequence of relative K-theory\n$$ \\dots \\to K_i(R,I) \\to K_i(R) \\to K_i(R/I) \\to \\dots $$\nimplies that the map $K_i(R) \\to K_i(R/I)$ induces an isomorphism on the $\\ell$-primary torsion subgroups for any $\\ell \\neq p$.\nApplying this to our case with $R=\\mathbb{Z}/27$ and $p_0=3$, for any prime $\\ell \\neq 3$, we have:\n$$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{\\ell\\} \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3)\\{\\ell\\}$$\nThe K-groups of finite fields were computed by Quillen. For a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we have $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_q) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\nSince $\\mathbb{Z}/3$ is the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_3$, we have $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, its $\\ell$-primary part $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3)\\{\\ell\\}$ is also zero.\nThis implies that for any prime $\\ell \\neq 3$, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{\\ell\\}=0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\nThus, for $n \\ge 1$, the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ must be a 3-group. The group is non-zero if and only if its 3-primary part is non-zero.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the 3-primary part of the K-groups.**\nThe structure of the $p$-primary part of $K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ has been determined by Hesselholt and Madsen. A more direct result we can use is a stability theorem, for example from Geisser's work, which shows how the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ relate to those of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^{k-1}$ for high enough degrees.\nThe map $\\mathbb{Z}/p^m \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p^{m-1}$ induces an isomorphism on the $p$-primary parts of the K-groups $K_i$ for $i$ in a certain \"stable range\". Specifically, the map $K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^m)\\{p\\} \\to K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^{m-1})\\{p\\}$ is an isomorphism for $i > m-1 + \\frac{m-1}{p-1}$.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem with $p=3$.\n1.  For $m=2$ (the map $\\mathbb{Z}/9 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/3$), the stability range is $i > (2-1) + \\frac{2-1}{3-1} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = 1.5$. Thus, for $i \\ge 2$, the map $K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/9)\\{3\\} \\to K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/3)\\{3\\}$ is an isomorphism.\n2.  For $m=3$ (the map $\\mathbb{Z}/27 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/9$), the stability range is $i > (3-1) + \\frac{3-1}{3-1} = 2 + \\frac{2}{2} = 3$. Thus, for $i \\ge 4$, the map $K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{3\\} \\to K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/9)\\{3\\}$ is an isomorphism.\n\nWe are interested in $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{3\\}$.\nLet's consider $n \\ge 2$. This means the degree of the K-group is $i = 2n \\ge 4$.\nFrom point (2), since $2n \\ge 4$, we have $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{3\\} \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/9)\\{3\\}$.\nFrom point (1), since $2n \\ge 4 \\ge 2$, we have $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/9)\\{3\\} \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3)\\{3\\}$.\nCombining these, for $n \\ge 2$, we get $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{3\\} \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3)\\{3\\}$.\nAs established in Step 3, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$, so its 3-primary part is zero.\nTherefore, for all $n \\ge 2$, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{3\\} = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the remaining case, n=1.**\nThe stability argument does not apply for $n=1$, since the degree is $i=2n=2$, which is not in the stable range for the map from $\\mathbb{Z}/27$. We need to analyze $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{3\\}$ separately.\nThe explicit calculations of Hesselholt and Madsen provide the structure of these lower K-groups. Using the formula for the order of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^m)\\{p\\}$ summarized in various sources (e.g., from Angeltveit's thesis based on Hesselholt-Madsen and Rognes):\nFor $p$ odd, $m \\ge 1, n \\ge 1$, $|K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^m)\\{p\\}| = p^N$ where $N = \\min \\{ m, \\nu_p(n) + \\nu_p( ( \\frac{p-1}{d_n})! ) + \\delta_{d_n,1} \\}$ with $d_n = \\gcd(n, p-1)$.\n\nFor our case, $p=3, m=3, n=1$.\n- $n=1$ is odd.\n- $d_1 = \\gcd(1, 3-1) = \\gcd(1,2) = 1$.\n- $\\delta_{d_1,1} = 1$ since $d_1=1$.\n- $\\nu_3(1)=0$.\n- $\\frac{p-1}{d_n} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n- $\\nu_3(2!) = \\nu_3(2)=0$.\nThe exponent $N$ is:\n$N = \\min\\{3, \\nu_3(1) + \\nu_3(2!) + 1\\} = \\min\\{3, 0+0+1\\} = 1$.\nSo, $|K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)\\{3\\}| = 3^1=3$. This group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/3$.\nSince the 3-primary part of $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero, the group $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the results.**\n- For $n=1$, $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero.\n- For $n \\ge 2$, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero because its 3-primary part is zero (by the stability theorem), and its non-3-primary parts are also zero.\n\nTherefore, the only natural number $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero is $n=1$. The largest such natural number is 1."
