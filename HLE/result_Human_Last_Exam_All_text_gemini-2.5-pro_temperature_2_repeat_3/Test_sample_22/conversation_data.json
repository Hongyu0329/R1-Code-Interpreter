    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the core concepts.**\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter that represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained *in theory* by all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being considered, typically those on a standard genotyping chip. It is the theoretical upper limit or ceiling on the predictive power you could achieve if you used a perfect linear model with the true, underlying effect sizes for every single SNP.\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is a weighted sum of the risk alleles an individual carries. Crucially, the weights (effect sizes) used in this sum are not the true, unknown effect sizes. Instead, they are *estimates* derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) conducted on a discovery sample of finite size.\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is measured by testing the PGS in a new, independent sample (a target sample). The most common metric is the R-squared (R²), which is the proportion of the variance in the phenotype that is successfully explained by the PGS.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between SNP heritability and PGS predictive ability.**\n\nThe core of the question lies in the difference between a theoretical maximum and a practical achievement.\n\n*   SNP heritability (`h²_SNP`) represents the **total genetic signal** available from the SNPs for prediction. It is the \"gold standard\" or the \"potential\".\n*   The predictive ability of a PGS (its R²) represents the **amount of that signal that has been successfully captured** by the PGS model.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the reasons why the predictive ability of a PGS is lower than SNP heritability.**\n\nSeveral factors ensure that the practically achieved R² of a PGS is lower than the theoretical ceiling of `h²_SNP`:\n\n1.  **Imperfect Effect Size Estimates:** The single most important reason is that a GWAS is performed on a finite sample. This means the effect size estimates for each SNP have some level of statistical error (standard error). When these imperfect weights are used to build the PGS, its predictive accuracy is degraded. The predictive power of a PGS increases as the sample size of the discovery GWAS increases, because the effect size estimates become more precise, but it can only approach `h²_SNP` as the sample size approaches infinity.\n2.  **LD Structure Differences:** Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), the non-random association of alleles at different loci, can vary between the GWAS discovery population and the target population where the PGS is being tested (e.g., populations of different ancestry). This mismatch reduces the PGS's accuracy.\n3.  **Methodological Choices:** Methods for constructing a PGS often involve selecting a subset of SNPs based on a statistical significance threshold (e.g., P < 5x10⁻⁸). This can lead to issues like \"winner's curse,\" where the effect sizes of selected SNPs are overestimated, causing the PGS to perform worse in an independent sample than expected.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\n\nA polygenic score is an attempt to capture the predictive signal quantified by SNP heritability. Because the PGS is built with imperfect information (estimated effect sizes from a finite sample) and is subject to other practical limitations, it cannot capture the total available signal. Therefore, its predictive ability (R²) is fundamentally bounded by the SNP heritability (`h²_SNP`). The amount of variance explained by a PGS can, at its absolute best, approach SNP heritability, but it cannot exceed it. The statement is therefore correct.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
