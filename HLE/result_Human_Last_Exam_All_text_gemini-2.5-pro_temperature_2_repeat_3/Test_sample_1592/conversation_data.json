    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Waskaganish Gathering Place**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place refers to the Cree community of Waskaganish. It is located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada. Geographically, it sits on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate coordinates are 51°11′ N latitude, 78°46′ W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidate Provinces and Territories**\nThe question asks for the closest province or territory *excluding Quebec*. By examining a map of Canada, we can identify the political entities that are geographically near Waskaganish:\n*   **Ontario:** This province lies to the west and south of James Bay. The Ontario-Quebec border runs south from the bay. The entire western shoreline of James Bay belongs to Ontario.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory includes all the islands within James Bay, such as Akimiski Island, Charlton Island, and the Twin Islands.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador** and **New Brunswick** are also adjacent to Quebec, but they are located far to the east and southeast, respectively, making them much more distant than Ontario or Nunavut.\n\nTherefore, the primary candidates are Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Distance to Ontario**\nThe closest part of Ontario to Waskaganish is not a specific town, but the provincial border itself. This border follows the western coastline of James Bay. To find the shortest distance, we measure from Waskaganish across the southern portion of James Bay to the nearest point on the Ontario mainland.\n*   **Careful Point:** We are measuring to the closest point of land that is part of Ontario, not necessarily a populated place.\n*   **Analysis:** On a map, the straight-line distance from the community of Waskaganish, across the water, to the closest section of the Ontario coastline is approximately 55 to 60 kilometers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Distance to Nunavut**\nThe closest parts of Nunavut are the islands in James Bay. The most prominent nearby islands are Charlton Island and Akimiski Island.\n*   **Careful Point:** Nunavut's territory begins at the shoreline of these islands.\n*   **Analysis:** The closest of these islands to Waskaganish is Charlton Island, located to the northwest. The distance from Waskaganish to the nearest point on Charlton Island is over 100 kilometers. Akimiski Island is even further away.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nBy comparing the shortest distances calculated in the previous steps:\n*   Distance to Ontario: ~55-60 km\n*   Distance to Nunavut: >100 km\n\nThe distance to the Ontario shoreline is significantly shorter than the distance to the nearest island belonging to Nunavut.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\nThe analysis clearly shows that the landmass of the province of Ontario, located across the southern part of James Bay, is geographically closer to Waskaganish than any territory belonging to Nunavut or any other province.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
