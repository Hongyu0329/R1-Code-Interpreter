    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n\n### Step 1: Define a Pauli Channel\n\nA qudit is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A quantum channel $\\Lambda$ is a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map that transforms density matrices on $\\mathcal{H}_d$ to other density matrices on $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\nA Pauli channel is a specific type of quantum channel constructed from the generalized Pauli operators (also known as Weyl-Heisenberg operators). These operators, denoted as $U_{a,b}$ for $a,b \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$, form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. There are $d^2$ such operators. Let's denote the index set as $G = \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$, so we can write the Pauli operators as $\\{U_g\\}_{g \\in G}$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is defined by a probability distribution $\\{p_g\\}_{g \\in G}$ (where $p_g \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{g \\in G} p_g = 1$) as follows:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{g \\in G} p_g U_g \\rho U_g^\\dagger $$\nThe Kraus operators for this channel are $E_g = \\sqrt{p_g} U_g$. The trace-preserving condition $\\sum_g E_g^\\dagger E_g = I_d$ is satisfied because $\\sum_g p_g U_g^\\dagger U_g = (\\sum_g p_g) I_d = I_d$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank\n\nEvery quantum channel $\\Lambda$ has a complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$, which describes the information flowing from the system to the environment. If the Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$ are $\\{E_k\\}$, the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps an input density matrix $\\rho$ to a matrix describing the state of the environment. The entries of this output matrix are given by:\n$$ (\\Lambda^c(\\rho))_{jk} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho E_j^\\dagger E_k) $$\nHere, the indices $j,k$ range over the set of Kraus operators. For a Pauli channel, we can take the index set to be $S = \\{g \\in G \\mid p_g > 0\\}$, the support of the probability distribution. Let $|S|=r$. The output of $\\Lambda^c$ is an $r \\times r$ matrix.\n\nThe rank of a channel is the dimension of its output space. For the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$, its rank is the dimension of the subspace of matrices spanned by $\\{\\Lambda^c(\\rho) \\mid \\rho \\text{ is a density matrix}\\}$. By linearity, we can consider the input $\\rho$ to be any matrix in the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $\\mathcal{M}_d$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Rank of the Complementary Channel\n\nTo find the rank of $\\Lambda^c$, we can determine the dimension of the space spanned by the operator basis $\\{E_j^\\dagger E_k\\}_{j,k \\in S}$.\nLet's analyze the operators $E_j^\\dagger E_k$ for a Pauli channel, with $j, k \\in S$:\n$$ E_j^\\dagger E_k = (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k) = \\sqrt{p_j p_k} U_j^\\dagger U_k $$\nSince $p_j > 0$ and $p_k > 0$ for $j,k \\in S$, the dimension of the span of these operators is the same as the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k \\mid j, k \\in S\\}$.\n\nThe set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_g\\}_{g \\in G}$ has the property that the product of any two is proportional to another Pauli operator. Specifically, $U_j^\\dagger U_k$ is a scalar multiple of $U_{k-j}$, where the subtraction is performed component-wise modulo $d$.\n\nSo, the space spanned by $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k \\mid j, k \\in S\\}$ is the same as the space spanned by $\\{U_{k-j} \\mid j, k \\in S\\}$. Since the operators $\\{U_g\\}_{g \\in G}$ are linearly independent, the dimension of this space is equal to the number of distinct indices of the form $k-j$ that can be generated.\n\nThis number is precisely the size of the difference set of $S$, defined as:\n$$ S-S = \\{k-j \\mid k \\in S, j \\in S\\} $$\nTherefore, the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is:\n$$ \\text{Rank}(\\Lambda^c) = |S-S| $$\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the Rank\n\nThe problem is now to find the maximum possible value of $|S-S|$, where $S$ can be any non-empty subset of the group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$.\n\nThe set $S-S$ is a subset of $G$. Thus, its size is bounded by the size of the group $G$:\n$$ |S-S| \\le |G| = |\\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d| = d^2 $$\nSo, the maximal possible rank is at most $d^2$.\n\nTo show that this maximum is achievable, we need to find a valid Pauli channel for which $|S-S| = d^2$. This can be achieved by choosing the support set $S$ to be the entire group $G$.\n\nLet's choose $S = G = \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$. This corresponds to a Pauli channel where all probabilities $p_g$ are strictly positive. A simple example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_g = 1/d^2$ for all $g \\in G$.\nFor this choice, $S=G$, the difference set is:\n$$ S-S = G-G = \\{k-j \\mid k \\in G, j \\in G\\} $$\nSince $G$ is a group, for any element $h \\in G$, we can write $h = k-j$ for some $k, j \\in G$ (e.g., take $k=h$ and $j=0$). Thus, $G-G = G$.\nThe size of the difference set is $|G| = d^2$.\n\nTherefore, for the completely depolarizing channel, the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$. Since we have shown that the rank cannot exceed $d^2$, this is the maximal possible rank.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is given by $|S-S|$, where $S$ is the set of Pauli operators that are applied with non-zero probability. The maximum value of this rank is achieved when the difference set $S-S$ is the entire group of Pauli operator indices, $G = \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$. This maximum is $|G| = d^2$ and can be attained, for instance, by the completely depolarizing channel where $S=G$.\n\nThe maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
