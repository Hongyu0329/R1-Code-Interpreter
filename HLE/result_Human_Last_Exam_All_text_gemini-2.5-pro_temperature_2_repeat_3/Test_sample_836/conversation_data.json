    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for the common name of a specific mathematical quantity used within a particular scientific community. Let's break down the key phrases:\n*   **\"Generalized pair correlation function\"**: This is the starting physical quantity. It describes the correlation between particles (in this case, neutrons) at two different points in space and time.\n*   **\"Space-time, double Fourier transform\"**: This is the mathematical operation performed on the pair correlation function. It transforms the function from the space-time domain to the wavevector-frequency domain.\n*   **\"Nuclear criticality community\"**: This specifies the scientific field of interest. The terminology used in this community is what we need to identify.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Generalized Pair Correlation Function\nIn neutron transport theory, the generalized pair correlation function, which can be denoted as $g_2(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$, measures the probability of detecting a neutron at position $\\mathbf{r}_1$ at time $t_1$, given that another neutron was detected at $\\mathbf{r}_2$ at time $t_2$. In stationary, homogeneous systems (like an idealized large reactor), this function depends only on the separation in space and time, i.e., $g_2(\\Delta\\mathbf{r}, \\Delta t)$, where $\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2$ and $\\Delta t = t_1 - t_2$. This function contains fundamental information about the underlying fission chain dynamics that create correlations between neutrons.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Mathematical Transformation\nThe question specifies a \"space-time, double Fourier transform\". This means we apply the Fourier transform with respect to both the spatial separation variable ($\\Delta\\mathbf{r}$) and the temporal separation variable ($\\Delta t$).\n*   The time transform converts the time difference ($\\Delta t$) into angular frequency ($\\omega$).\n*   The space transform converts the position difference ($\\Delta\\mathbf{r}$) into a wave vector ($\\mathbf{k}$).\n\nThe resulting mathematical object, let's call it $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, represents the spectrum of the correlations. It answers the question: \"How much correlation is there at a specific temporal frequency $\\omega$ and a specific spatial wavelength ($2\\pi/|\\mathbf{k}|$)?\".\n\n### Step 4: Connecting to the Nuclear Criticality Community and Identifying Terminology\nThe study of correlations in the neutron population is a subfield of reactor physics known as **neutron noise analysis**. This analysis is a powerful diagnostic tool.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing from related quantities.** In experimental practice, one often measures correlations between two fixed detectors at positions $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$. The time Fourier transform of this correlation function is called the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**, denoted as $CPSD(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\omega)$. Notice this is only a *time* Fourier transform, not the *space-time double transform* the question asks for. The CPSD is a function of frequency and the two detector locations, not frequency and wave vector.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The analogy with other fields.** The mathematical operation described is identical to one used in condensed matter physics. There, the space-time Fourier transform of the Van Hove correlation function (which describes particle density correlations) is known as the **Dynamic Structure Factor**, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$. This quantity is directly measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments to probe the material's atomic structure and dynamics.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the common name.** Given the direct analogy, pioneering researchers in theoretical reactor noise, such as M. M. R. Williams and I. Pázsit, adopted the same terminology. They refer to the space-time double Fourier transform of the neutron-neutron correlation function as the **Dynamic Structure Factor** of the multiplying medium. It describes the inherent \"structure\" of the neutron field and its \"dynamics\" (how that structure evolves and propagates). While a less formal description might be \"the (k, ω) spectral density,\" the proper and established technical name is Dynamic Structure Factor.\n\n### Final Answer Synthesis\nThe generalized pair correlation function describes neutron correlations in space and time. The double Fourier transform decomposes these correlations into their frequency and wavevector components. In the nuclear criticality and reactor noise community, this quantity, by direct analogy to condensed matter physics, is called the Dynamic Structure Factor.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
