    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and the corresponding protein sequence.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Constraints**\n*   **Goal:** Translate a given nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence.\n*   **Input Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n*   **Key Constraint:** The sequence is from the \"middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)\". An ORF is a continuous sequence of codons that codes for a protein. A key characteristic of a sequence from the middle of an ORF is that it must not contain any premature stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`).\n\n**2. The Concept of Reading Frames**\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different \"reading frames\" on the forward strand. The frame is determined by which nucleotide is chosen as the starting point for the first codon.\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\nWe must test all three frames. The correct frame will be the one that produces a continuous chain of amino acids without any stop codons.\n\n**3. Analysis of Frame 1**\n*   **Grouping:** We group the sequence into codons starting from the first nucleotide.\n    `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg ...`\n*   **Translation and Evaluation:**\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `cat` -> H (Histidine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tag` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion for Frame 1:** This frame contains a stop codon (`tag`) just five codons in. This contradicts the fact that the sequence is from the middle of an ORF. Later in the sequence, other stop codons (`taa` and `tga`) are also present. Therefore, Frame 1 is incorrect.\n\n**4. Analysis of Frame 2**\n*   **Grouping:** We ignore the first nucleotide (`g`) and start grouping from the second nucleotide.\n    `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n    (The final nucleotide `c` is incomplete and ignored).\n*   **Translation and Evaluation:**\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion for Frame 2:** This frame translates into a continuous protein sequence with no stop codons. This fits the description of being from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**5. Analysis of Frame 3**\n*   **Grouping:** We ignore the first two nucleotides (`gg`) and start grouping from the third nucleotide.\n    `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga ...`\n*   **Translation and Evaluation:**\n    *   `aca` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gcg` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `act` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `tga` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion for Frame 3:** This frame contains a stop codon (`tga`). Therefore, Frame 3 is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Frame 2 results in an open reading frame without stop codons, as expected for a sequence from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**Frame:** Frame 2\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVEKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVEKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
