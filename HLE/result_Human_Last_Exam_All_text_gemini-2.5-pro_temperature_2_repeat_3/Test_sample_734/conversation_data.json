    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A Christian theologian.\n    *   **Key Achievement:** Developed \"specialized terminology.\" This means we are looking for specific, defined terms or concepts, not just a general idea.\n    *   **The Terminology's Function:** It must describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n    *   **Application 1 (Miracle):** It must be applicable to the virgin birth of Jesus. This is a singular, supernatural event where a known law of nature (procreation requiring male and female) is superseded for a specific purpose.\n    *   **Application 2 (Systemic Change):** It must also be applicable to the \"possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall.\" This refers to a fundamental, ongoing shift in how the natural world operates (e.g., the introduction of death, decay, futility, and pain into creation as a consequence of sin).\n    *   **Crucial Qualifier:** The question asks who *first* developed this kind of terminology. This prioritizes earlier theologians over later ones who may have refined the concepts.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Evaluation of Theologians:**\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** A strong candidate. He developed the highly specialized terminology of God's *potentia absoluta* (absolute power, what God is capable of doing in principle) and *potentia ordinata* (ordained power, how God has chosen to govern the world through established laws). A miracle like the virgin birth would be an exercise of *potentia absoluta* that works outside the *potentia ordinata*. The Fall could be understood as a shift in the *potentia ordinata* itselfâ€”a new ordained order for a fallen world. This fits the criteria very well. However, the qualifier \"first\" is a potential issue, as scholastic thought built on earlier foundations.\n    *   **Reformation Theologians (e.g., Calvin, 16th Century):** They spoke of God's providence, distinguishing ordinary works from extraordinary acts (miracles). However, they didn't typically coin new philosophical terminology for the mechanics of natural law in the way the scholastics did. They are also much later.\n    *   **Early Church Fathers:** This is the most likely period to find the \"first\" theologian to address this. The key figure who engaged deeply with questions of creation, miracles, free will, and the consequences of the Fall is Augustine of Hippo.\n\n3.  **In-Depth Analysis of Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th Century):**\n    *   **Context:** Augustine wrote extensively on creation (e.g., in *On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis*) and miracles (e.g., in *The City of God*). He needed a framework to explain how God, having created a good and orderly world, could still perform miracles and how the original goodness of that world was affected by the Fall.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** Augustine developed a crucial distinction. He argued that a miracle is not *contra naturam* (contrary to nature) in an absolute sense, because God is the author of nature and His will *is* the ultimate nature of any created thing. Instead, he defined a miracle as being ***contra quam est nota natura*** (contrary to nature *as it is known to us*).\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** Using Augustine's terminology, the virgin birth is not a violation of nature itself, but an act of God that goes against the regular, observable course of nature that we know. It's an event *praeter naturam* (beyond or beside nature's known course), done by the will of the one who created nature's course.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** Augustine's framework also elegantly applies to changes at the Fall. Before the Fall, the *nota natura* (the known nature) of humanity and the world included, for instance, freedom from death and decay. After the Fall, God instituted a new penalty and, with it, a new \"known course of nature\" for the world, one that now includes suffering, toil, and death. Therefore, the very \"laws\" governing the system were altered.\n    *   **Conclusion on Augustine:** He fits all criteria perfectly. He developed a specific, nuanced terminology (*contra quam est nota natura*) that allows for both singular miracles (like the virgin birth) and a systemic alteration of nature's operations (as in the Fall). Crucially, as he lived centuries before Aquinas, he is the one who *first* developed this kind of sophisticated framework. Aquinas and later scholastics built upon the foundation Augustine had laid.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis points directly to Augustine of Hippo. His distinction between \"nature\" in its ultimate sense (God's will) and \"nature as it is known to us\" (*quam est nota natura*) was a groundbreaking terminological development. It provided the first robust theological language capable of explaining both unique miracles and fundamental shifts in the natural order without making God seem capricious or contradictory.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
