    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**1. Understanding Coiled-Coil Structure and Heptad Repeats**\n\nCoiled-coils consist of alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their sequences feature a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The identity of amino acids at specific positions within this repeat determines the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, etc.).\n\n*   **Positions `a` and `d`**: These form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil. They are the most critical determinants of the oligomeric state.\n*   **Positions `e` and `g`**: These are typically charged or polar residues located on the surface, flanking the hydrophobic core. They form electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices, which contribute to stability and specificity.\n\n**2. Determining the Heptad Register**\n\nFirst, we must correctly assign the `abcdefg` positions for the sequences. The `a` and `d` positions must be predominantly hydrophobic. Let's analyze the common `E I...` start of the sequences. If we set `I` to the `a` position, the register becomes `gabcdef`.\n\nExample with the first repeat of the first sequence: `E I A Q A L K`\n*   Register: `g a b c d e f`\n*   Assignment: `E(g) I(a) A(b) Q(c) A(d) L(e) K(f)`\nIn this register, `a`=Isoleucine (I) and `d`=Alanine (A). Both are hydrophobic. This is a chemically sound register that we will apply to all sequences.\n\n**3. Analyzing Each Sequence Step-by-Step**\n\nWe will analyze the amino acids at the key `a`, `d`, `e`, and `g` positions for each 28-amino-acid sequence (4 heptad repeats).\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **`a` positions**: I, I, I, I\n*   **`d` positions**: A, A, A, A\n*   **`e` positions**: L, L, L, L\n*   **`g` positions**: E, E, E, E\n*   **Analysis**: The core is formed by Isoleucine (`a`) and Alanine (`d`), which is strongly hydrophobic and typical for stable coiled-coils. The `e` position is occupied by Leucine (L), a large hydrophobic residue. In a parallel coiled-coil, a large residue at the `e` or `g` position creates steric clashes that destabilize oligomers larger than a dimer.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **`a` positions**: I, I, **N**, I\n*   **`d` positions**: L, L, L, L\n*   **`e` positions**: K, K, K, K\n*   **`g` positions**: E, E, E, E\n*   **Analysis**: The core is primarily `I` at `a` and `L` at `d`, a pattern that favors trimers. The third `a` position contains a polar Asparagine (N). A polar residue in the hydrophobic core is highly destabilizing for a dimer but can be stabilized in trimers or tetramers by forming a hydrogen-bond network. However, the GCN4-pIL mutant (`I` at `a`, `L` at `d`) is a mix of dimers and trimers, suggesting the `I/L` signal is not absolute. A single `N` might be an insufficient signal to completely shift the state to a trimer from a default dimeric state. The favorable `E(g)-K(e)` salt bridges stabilize any parallel oligomer. Given the ambiguity, it may default to the simplest oligomer.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **`a` positions**: I, I, I, I\n*   **`d` positions**: I, I, I, I\n*   **`e` positions**: K, K, K, K\n*   **`g` positions**: E, E, E, E\n*   **Analysis**: The core consists entirely of Isoleucine (`I`) at both `a` and `d` positions. This is the canonical and very strong sequence signature for a parallel **tetramer**. The `Î²`-branched side chains of Isoleucine pack extremely well in a tetrameric interface. The `E(g)-K(e)` salt bridges further stabilize the structure.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **`a` positions**: I, I, I, I\n*   **`d` positions**: **Q, Q, Q, Q**\n*   **`e` positions**: L, L, L, L\n*   **`g` positions**: E, E, E, E\n*   **Analysis**: This sequence has a hydrophobic Isoleucine (`I`) at the `a` positions but a polar Glutamine (`Q`) at all `d` positions. Polar residues in the core are strong drivers of higher-order oligomerization (trimer and above). The `I(a)/Q(d)` pattern is known to favor pentamers. However, like in Sequence 1, the `e` positions contain Leucine (`L`), which sterically disfavors oligomers larger than dimers. This creates a conflict between the core, which wants to form a pentamer, and the flanking residues, which want to form a dimer. In such conflicting cases, the structure often fails to form the intended complex oligomer and reverts to the simplest, most stable state.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **`a` positions**: I, I, I, I\n*   **`d` positions**: **T, T, T, T**\n*   **`e` positions**: L, L, L, L\n*   **`g` positions**: E, E, E, E\n*   **Analysis**: The core has Isoleucine (`I`) at `a` and the polar Threonine (`T`) at `d`. This `I(a)/T(d)` combination is a very strong and specific design feature for forcing the formation of a **trimer**. The Threonine side chains form a stable, hydrogen-bonded network within the trimer core. While this sequence also has the dimer-favoring `L` at the `e` position, the `I/T` trimer signal is considered one of the strongest and most specific drivers, capable of overcoming the weaker, unfavorable flank interaction.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Trimer (3)**.\n\n**Final Summary**\nCombining the state for each sequence:\n1.  Dimer (2)\n2.  Dimer (2)\n3.  Tetramer (4)\n4.  Dimer (2)\n5.  Trimer (3)\n\nThe resulting sequence of oligomeric states is **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This matches one of the answer choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
