    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for the **first statute** that meets three specific criteria:\n1.  It must be a statute of the **modern State of Israel** (i.e., passed by the Knesset after its establishment in 1949, following the state's founding in 1948).\n2.  It must **explicitly introduce** the concept. This means the statute must contain the actual term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew: \"תום לב\", *tom lev*) or its direct grammatical variations (e.g., \"בתום לב\", *be'tom lev*).\n3.  It must be the **first** such statute to do so.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Potential Candidates and Eliminating Later Ones\nThe principle of \"good faith\" is most famously associated with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Sections 12 and 39 of this law elevated good faith to a super-principle governing all contracts and legal obligations. However, since the question asks for the *first* statute, we must investigate if the concept was explicitly codified in Israeli law *before* 1973. This makes the Contracts Law a point of reference, but not the answer itself.\n\n### Step 3: Examining Pre-1973 Legislation\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, Israel undertook a major project of codifying its civil law, replacing the mixture of Ottoman and British Mandatory law. We need to examine key statutes from this period chronologically.\n\n*   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957**: This ordinance does contain the term \"good faith\" in the context of a \"holder in due course\" (\"אוחז כשורה\"). However, this is a \"[New Version]\" of a law from the British Mandate period. It was a restatement and consolidation of existing law, not a novel introduction of the concept into original Israeli legislation. Therefore, it is often not considered the \"first introduction\" in the spirit of creating a new Israeli legal code.\n\n*   **Agency Law, 1965**: This law imposes a duty of loyalty on an agent (Section 8). While the duty of loyalty is a core component of the good faith principle, the law does not explicitly use the words \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*).\n\n*   **Sale Law, 1968**: This law governs sales contracts but does not contain a general, explicit provision on \"good faith\".\n\n*   **Land Law, 1969**: This was a monumental and original piece of Israeli legislation, completely overhauling property law. **Section 9** of this law addresses the issue of competing transactions for the same real estate. It gives priority to the first party, unless the second party has acted **in good faith** (\"בתום לב\"), paid consideration, and registered the transaction. This is a clear and explicit use of the term in a foundational, original Israeli statute.\n\n*   **Movable Property Law, 1971**: This law also uses the term \"good faith\" in the context of market overt rules (Section 4), but it was enacted *after* the Land Law.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesizing the Findings\nComparing the candidates, we can draw the following conclusion:\n\n1.  While the term \"good faith\" appeared in the 1957 \"New Version\" of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance, this was a carry-over from British Mandate law.\n2.  The **Land Law, 1969**, was an original and seminal statute of the modern State of Israel.\n3.  Section 9 of the Land Law was the first instance where the Knesset explicitly introduced the term \"good faith\" (\"בתום לב\") as a central element in a new, major piece of civil legislation that formed the basis of modern Israeli law.\n4.  Subsequent laws, like the Movable Property Law and the famous Contracts Law, also used the term, but the Land Law predates them.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on this analysis, the Land Law of 1969 was the first major, original statute of the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept and terminology of \"good faith\" into the new civil code.\n\n<<<Land Law>>>"
