    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe given ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the constant solutions of the ODE, which occur where $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the algebraic equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation, which are the equilibrium points, are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Stability of the Equilibrium Points**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we use the linearization method, which involves analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at $x^*$.\nLet's find the derivative, $f'(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **asymptotically stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the linearization test is inconclusive for this point. We need to use another method.\n\n**Step 3: Alternative Stability Analysis for $x=1$**\n\nWhen the linearization test is inconclusive, we can analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point. This is often done using a phase line diagram.\nOur function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative. It is zero only at $x=1$. This means the sign of $f(x)$ for $x \\neq 1$ is determined by the sign of $-x$.\n\nLet's check the sign of $f(x)$ in the intervals defined by the equilibrium points:\n*   For $x > 1$: $-x$ is negative, so $f(x) = (-)(+) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ is decreasing. The flow is to the left (←).\n*   For $0 < x < 1$: $-x$ is negative, so $f(x) = (-)(+) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ is decreasing. The flow is to the left (←).\n*   For $x < 0$: $-x$ is positive, so $f(x) = (+)(+) > 0$. This means $x(t)$ is increasing. The flow is to the right (→).\n\nThe phase line diagram is:\n$$ \\xrightarrow{\\hspace{1cm}} 0 \\xleftarrow{\\hspace{1cm}} 1 \\xleftarrow{\\hspace{1cm}} $$\n\nFrom the phase line, we can re-confirm the stability:\n*   At $x=0$, solutions from both the left ($x<0$) and the right ($0<x<1$) move towards $x=0$. Therefore, $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point.\n*   At $x=1$, solutions from the right ($x>1$) move towards $x=1$, but solutions from the left ($0<x<1$) move away from $x=1$. This is called a **semi-stable** equilibrium point.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Number of Stable Equilibria ($m$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** We must understand the precise definition of stability. An equilibrium point is considered stable (in the sense of Lyapunov) if solutions that start sufficiently close to it remain close for all future time. An equilibrium point is unstable if it is not stable.\n*   For the semi-stable point $x=1$, solutions starting to its left (e.g., $x(0) = 0.9$) will move away from it (towards 0). Therefore, $x=1$ does not satisfy the condition for Lyapunov stability and is classified as an **unstable** equilibrium point.\n\nThus, there is only one stable equilibrium point for this system, which is $x=0$.\nThe number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value we found for $m$:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\nThis is the final expression. There is no need to compute the numerical value of $2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
