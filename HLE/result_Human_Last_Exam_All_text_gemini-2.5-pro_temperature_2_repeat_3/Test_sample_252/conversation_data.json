    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed to achieve a specific task: constructing a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\" using \"computed tomography\" principles.\n\n*   **Full Spectral Volume:** This refers to a 3-dimensional data set, often called a hyperspectral data cube. The three dimensions are two spatial dimensions (X and Y, like a normal image) and one spectral dimension (λ, the wavelength of light). The goal is to determine the intensity of light for every wavelength at every pixel in the scene.\n*   **Single Image:** This is a crucial constraint. All the information required for the reconstruction must be captured in a single snapshot by a 2D detector (like a camera sensor). We cannot take multiple pictures with different settings.\n*   **Computed Tomography (CT):** This is the specified method. We need to think about how CT works. In medicine, CT scanners reconstruct a 3D spatial volume (X, Y, Z) of a patient's body. They do this by capturing multiple 2D projection images (X-rays) from many different angles around the patient. A single X-ray projection is insufficient to reconstruct the 3D volume. The principle relies on combining multiple, distinct views.\n*   **Diffraction Grating:** This is the tool. A diffraction grating disperses light, meaning it splits white light into a rainbow (a spectrum). It deflects light at an angle that depends on the light's wavelength.\n\n**Step 2: Create the Analogy**\nWe must apply the principle of computed tomography to the problem of spectral imaging.\n\n*   **Object to Reconstruct:** In medical CT, it's a 3D spatial object (X, Y, Z). In our case, it's a 3D spatio-spectral data cube (X, Y, λ).\n*   **Projections:** In medical CT, these are the 2D X-ray images taken from different angles. In our case, a \"projection\" is the image formed on the 2D detector after the light from the scene has been dispersed by a diffraction grating.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Effect of One Grating**\nLet's consider using just one diffraction grating.\n\n*   A single grating disperses light along one axis. Imagine an image of a scene passing through a grating that disperses light horizontally. For every point in the scene, its light is spread out into a horizontal line of colors on the detector.\n*   The resulting image on the detector is a smear where the horizontal spatial information (X) is mixed up with the spectral information (λ). The vertical spatial information (Y) remains intact.\n*   This smeared image is analogous to a *single* X-ray projection in medical CT. As we established, a single projection is fundamentally insufficient to reconstruct a 3D object using tomographic methods. There's an inherent ambiguity: a bright spot on the detector could be from a certain wavelength at one position, or a different wavelength at a nearby position. The problem is ill-posed.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Effect of a Second Grating**\nTo solve the tomographic problem, we need more \"projections\" or \"views\".\n\n*   How can we get another view? By dispersing the light in a different direction. This requires another grating function.\n*   Let's add a second grating, oriented perpendicularly to the first (e.g., one dispersing horizontally and one dispersing vertically).\n*   Now we have two different projections of the data cube:\n    1.  A projection where the X and λ dimensions are mixed.\n    2.  A projection where the Y and λ dimensions are mixed.\n*   By capturing these two different projections (plus the original undispersed image, which is the zero-order diffraction), we have enough distinct information to \"un-mix\" the spatial and spectral data. The reconstruction algorithm can use the information from both dispersed images to uniquely determine the spectrum at each (X, Y) point. This satisfies the requirement of using computed tomography principles, which rely on multiple views.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The technique described is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n*   In a real CTIS system, one doesn't typically use two separate physical gratings. Instead, a single optical element called a 2D grating (or crossed grating) is used. However, this single component is specifically designed to function as two perpendicular gratings, producing multiple dispersed images (projections) simultaneously on the detector.\n*   The question asks for the minimum number of *gratings* necessary. This refers to the number of independent dispersion functions required to make the problem solvable via tomography. Since one dispersion function is insufficient, the minimum required is two.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTo apply the principles of computed tomography for reconstructing a 3D (X, Y, λ) data cube from a single 2D image, at least two different projections are necessary. Each projection is created by a diffraction grating dispersing light along a unique axis. Therefore, the function of at least two gratings is required.\n\n<<<B>>>"
