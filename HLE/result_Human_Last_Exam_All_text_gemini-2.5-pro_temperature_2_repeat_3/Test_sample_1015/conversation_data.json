    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Movement:** A *cambré derrière* is a ballet term for a bend of the upper body backward from the waist. It involves the spine, head, arms, and requires balance supported by the legs and core.\n2.  **Identify the Styles:** We need to compare two major classical ballet training systems:\n    *   **Vaganova Method:** Developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia. It is known for its precision, strength, logically structured training, and expressive use of the upper body (epaulement). The focus is on clean lines and controlled strength.\n    *   **Balanchine Method/Style:** Developed by choreographer George Balanchine for his New York City Ballet. It is a neoclassical style characterized by speed, musicality, athleticism, and larger, more extreme lines. It often involves positions that are \"off-balance\" to create dynamic energy.\n3.  **Analyze the Execution of Cambré Derrière in Each Style:**\n\n    *   **Vaganova Cambré Derrière:**\n        *   **Initiation:** The bend originates from the upper back (thoracic spine), lifting the sternum up and back. The lower back is supported and engaged to prevent compression.\n        *   **Hips:** The hips are kept square and stable, directly over the supporting legs. There is a very slight press forward for counterbalance, but the primary goal is to maintain vertical alignment from the hips down. The focus is on spinal flexibility and back strength.\n        *   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back towards the ceiling or one hand. The arms, often from a 5th position *en haut* (high), open slightly but maintain their shape, framing the head. The movement is controlled and feels \"placed.\"\n\n    *   **Balanchine Cambré Derrière:**\n        *   **Initiation:** The movement is often initiated by pushing the hips significantly forward. This creates a counterbalance that allows for a deeper and more dramatic backbend.\n        *   **Hips:** The placement of the hips is the most defining characteristic. The hips press forward away from the heels, creating a deep, sweeping curve through the entire body. This is a hallmark of the Balanchine aesthetic, which prizes long, extended lines and dynamic, off-balance positions.\n        *   **Head and Arms:** The backbend is often deeper, with the head potentially dropping back further. The entire movement has a larger, more \"architectural\" and expansive quality. It's less about controlled muscular articulation and more about creating a powerful visual shape.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in *port de bras* (arm carriage), this is not the most fundamental difference. Both styles use allongé (lengthening). The primary driver of the different look is not the arms.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This aligns perfectly with our analysis. Vaganova prioritizes stable hips over the feet, while Balanchine uses a distinct forward push of the hips to create the shape. This is the key mechanical and aesthetic difference.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's work is often faster, a cambré in either style can be performed at various tempos depending on the exercise or choreography. Speed is not the defining difference of the technique itself.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The difference in the degree of the backbend is a *result* of the different hip placement. The forward push of the hips in the Balanchine style *allows* for a deeper-looking backbend. Therefore, hip placement is the root cause and the more precise answer.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** Head placement (epaulement) is important in both, but again, it follows the line of the spine. The dramatic difference in the shape of the spine is caused by the use of the hips.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most significant and foundational difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière is the use of the hips. Vaganova maintains hip stability for control, while Balanchine uses a pronounced forward hip placement to create a dynamic and extended line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
