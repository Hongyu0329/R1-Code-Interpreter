No, this approach is not valid.

The core ecological function of a mimicry syndrome is to present a recognizable warning signal to potential **predators**, not humans. The validity of the proposed clustering method hinges on whether human visual perception is a suitable proxy for the perception of a bee's natural predators (e.g., birds).

This assumption is invalid for a critical reason:

1.  **Differences in Visual Systems:** The primary predators of bumblebees, such as birds, have sensory capabilities that are vastly different from humans. Most significantly, many birds are tetrachromatic and can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which is invisible to humans. Bumblebee color patterns often have distinct UV reflectance components that are a crucial part of their warning signal. Two species that look nearly identical to a human may be easily distinguishable to a bird that can see their different UV patterns. Conversely, two species that look different to a human may appear similar to a bird.

Therefore, using human observers to rank similarity will produce clusters based on human perception, which do not necessarily align with the functional mimicry rings recognized by predators in the ecosystem. The approach fails to measure the signal as it is actually used, rendering the results ecologically invalid.
