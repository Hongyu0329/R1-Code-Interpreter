    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific paper:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The official title of this paper is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n2.  **Examine the paper for formal citations:** A direct examination of the original 1905 paper published in *Annalen der Physik* reveals a notable feature: it contains no footnotes and no bibliography. In a modern academic sense, there are no explicit citations to any other scientist's work. This lack of citations is also characteristic of his 1905 paper on special relativity.\n\n3.  **Analyze the question's specific wording:** The question asks \"Whose **lectures** did Albert Einstein **cite**...\". The word \"cite\" can mean more than just a formal footnote. It can also refer to an explicit intellectual reference within the text. The word \"lectures\" points towards a specific form of intellectual work, often associated with a particular professor or thinker.\n\n4.  **Investigate implicit citations in the paper's title and content:** The key to answering the question lies in the full title of Einstein's paper. He frames his work as a direct consequence of the **\"Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"**.\n\n5.  **Connect the theory to its main author:** At the turn of the 20th century, the molecular-kinetic theory of heat was a groundbreaking but still debated field. The scientist most associated with its development and defense was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. His work, particularly his development of statistical mechanics, was the cornerstone of this theory.\n\n6.  **Connect the author to \"lectures\":** Ludwig Boltzmann was a renowned university professor, and his ideas were widely disseminated through his influential lectures, many of which were collected and published (e.g., \"Lectures on Gas Theory\"). For a physicist in 1905, invoking the \"molecular-kinetic theory\" was tantamount to invoking the work of Boltzmann, as presented in his extensive writings and lectures.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the conclusion:** While Einstein did not include a formal footnote citing a specific page in a book, his deliberate and explicit grounding of his entire paper on the \"Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\" serves as a direct intellectual citation to the theory's principal architect, Ludwig Boltzmann. Given Boltzmann's role and his famous lectures on the topic, this is the most accurate and contextually aware answer. Einstein was confirming a prediction that stemmed directly from the theoretical framework Boltzmann had built.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Formal vs. Intellectual Citation:** It is crucial to distinguish between a formal citation (like a footnote) and an intellectual citation (explicitly naming a theory associated with one person). The paper lacks the former but contains the latter.\n*   **Historical Context:** Understanding who was associated with which theories in 1905 is essential. The link between Boltzmann and the kinetic theory was immediate and unambiguous to physicists of that era.\n*   **Einstein's Isolation:** Einstein worked in relative isolation at the Bern patent office, which helps explain his tendency to derive results from first principles and cite sparsely. However, he was deeply engaged with the foundational work of physicists like Boltzmann, which he studied on his own.\n\nBy analyzing the paper's title and the scientific context of the time, we can confidently identify the scientist whose work—disseminated through his famous lectures and writings—was being cited.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
