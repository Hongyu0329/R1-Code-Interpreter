Here are the specific residues involved in the interaction and modulation between the human CaVβ1 and CaVα1E subunits. The amino acid positions correspond to the human CaVβ1b isoform (UniProt accession P54283).

**1) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for INTERACTION with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the Alpha-Interaction-Domain Binding Pocket (ABP), which is the primary site of physical binding.

*   **Y299** (Tyrosine at position 299)
*   **L353** (Leucine at position 353)
*   **Y395** (Tyrosine at position 395) - A critical residue that forms a key hydrogen bond.
*   **V400** (Valine at position 400)
*   **V402** (Valine at position 402)
*   **L405** (Leucine at position 405)
*   **I463** (Isoleucine at position 463)
*   **L489** (Leucine at position 489)

**2) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning GATING PROPERTIES of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in various domains and are crucial for the allosteric modulation of channel function. They can often be mutated without abolishing the primary binding interaction.

*   **In the N-terminal Domain (primarily affecting inactivation):**
    *   **D24** (Aspartic Acid at position 24) - A key residue that modulates the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation.

*   **In the GK Domain (affecting various gating parameters):**
    *   **D298** (Aspartic Acid at position 298) - Located at the rim of the binding pocket, this residue is involved in functional coupling and affects inactivation.
    *   **K325** (Lysine at position 325) - Located on a secondary surface of the GK domain, this residue helps modulate the voltage dependence of activation.
    *   **R334** (Arginine at position 334) - Also located on the secondary modulatory surface, it plays a role in tuning the voltage sensitivity of the channel.
