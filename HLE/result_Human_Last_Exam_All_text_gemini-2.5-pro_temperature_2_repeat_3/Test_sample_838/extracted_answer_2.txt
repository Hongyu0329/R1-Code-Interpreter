The final product, C, is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane. This molecule is achiral because it does not contain any stereocenters. A stereocenter is a carbon atom attached to four unique groups, and no carbon atom in the structure of 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane meets this requirement. The original chirality of the starting material was eliminated in the first reaction step.
