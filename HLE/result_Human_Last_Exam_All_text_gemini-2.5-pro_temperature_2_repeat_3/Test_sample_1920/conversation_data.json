    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Conductor and its Prime Factorization\n\nThe conductor is given as $d = 53599$. The first step is to find its prime factorization.\n*   We can test small prime divisors. $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$.\n*   Dividing 7657 by 13: $7657 \\div 13 = 589$.\n*   Dividing 589 by 19: $589 \\div 19 = 31$.\n*   Since 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all prime numbers, the prime factorization of the conductor is:\n    $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor $d$ is a product of distinct primes (i.e., it is square-free).\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Structure of Dirichlet Characters\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a composite number $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\nThe key properties relating the character $\\chi$ to its components $\\chi_i$ are:\n*   **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n*   **Conductor:** The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components:\n    $\\text{cond}(\\chi) = \\text{cond}(\\chi_1) \\text{cond}(\\chi_2) \\dots \\text{cond}(\\chi_r)$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Conditions for Primitivity and Order\n\nWe are given two conditions for the character $\\chi$:\n1.  **It is a primitive character of conductor $d$**: For a character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ with $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, being primitive with conductor $d$ means that $\\text{cond}(\\chi) = d$. This holds if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i$, i.e., $\\text{cond}(\\chi_i) = p_i$.\n    *   **Careful point:** For a character modulo a prime $p$, it is primitive if and only if it is not the trivial character (the character which maps every number to 1). The trivial character has conductor 1. So, for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, $\\chi_i$ must be a non-trivial character. This is equivalent to requiring that the order of $\\chi_i$ must be greater than 1, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) > 1$.\n\n2.  **Its order is 6**: We must have $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$. Using the order formula from Step 2:\n    $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nLet $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. From the lcm condition, each $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. So $o_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Combining this with the primitivity condition ($o_i > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Available Component Characters\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check this condition for our primes and the required orders $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$:\n*   $p_1=7: p_1-1=6$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 6, characters of these orders exist.\n*   $p_2=13: p_2-1=12$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 12, characters of these orders exist.\n*   $p_3=19: p_3-1=18$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 18, characters of these orders exist.\n*   $p_4=31: p_4-1=30$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 30, characters of these orders exist.\n\nNow we count the number of characters for each possible order:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four prime factors ($7, 13, 19, 31$), the number of available primitive characters whose order divides 6 is $1 (\\text{order } 2) + 2 (\\text{order } 3) + 2 (\\text{order } 6) = 5$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Counts Using Combinatorics\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of component characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for each $i$, and their lcm is exactly 6. We can use complementary counting.\n\n1.  **Total number of combinations**: For each of the 4 component characters, there are 5 possible choices (1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, 2 of order 6). The total number of ways to choose these four characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$. This is the total number of primitive characters with conductor $d$ whose order divides 6.\n\n2.  **Subtract combinations where the order is not 6**: The lcm of the orders is not 6 if it lacks a factor of 2 or it lacks a factor of 3.\n    *   **Case A: lcm lacks a factor of 2.** This means every order $o_i$ is odd. From the possible orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, the only odd one is 3. So, every $\\chi_i$ must have order 3. For each of the 4 components, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ choices. The total number of combinations is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n    *   **Case B: lcm lacks a factor of 3.** This means no order $o_i$ is a multiple of 3. From the possible orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, the only one not divisible by 3 is 2. So, every $\\chi_i$ must have order 2. For each of the 4 components, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ choice. The total number of combinations is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n3.  **Final calculation**: The two cases above are mutually exclusive (in Case A, all orders are 3; in Case B, all orders are 2). Therefore, the number of combinations where the order is not 6 is the sum of the counts from these two cases: $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nThe number of characters with order exactly 6 is the total number of combinations minus those where the order is not 6:\nNumber of characters = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
