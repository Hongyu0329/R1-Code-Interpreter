    "This question requires a step-by-step analysis of linguistic history, specifically exploring a counterfactual scenario for the English language.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the current word \"sister\".** The first step is to understand the origin of the word we use today. \"Sister\" entered the English language during the Middle English period. Its direct ancestor is the Old Norse word *systir*. The Norse (Vikings) began raiding and settling in parts of England (the Danelaw) from the late 8th century onwards. Their language, Old Norse, was linguistically similar to Old English, which facilitated the borrowing of many core vocabulary words. Therefore, our modern word \"sister\" is a direct result of the Norse interaction with the Anglo-Saxons.\n\n2.  **Identify the original Anglo-Saxon word.** If \"sister\" came from the Norse, what word were the Anglo-Saxons using before the invasions? The native Old English word for sister was ***sweoster***. This word is the original, un-influenced term.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It's important to recognize that both the Old Norse *systir* and the Old English *sweoster* descend from the same ancient source: the Proto-Germanic word **swestēr*. This is why they are so similar and why the replacement happened relatively easily. Other modern relatives include the German *Schwester* and the Dutch *zuster*.\n\n3.  **Project the evolution of the native word.** Now, we must simulate how *sweoster* would have evolved from Old English to Modern English if it had not been replaced by the Norse equivalent. We can do this by observing how other Old English words with similar sounds and structures changed over the centuries.\n\n    *   **Old English to Middle English:** The Old English diphthong (two-vowel sound) `eo` typically simplified in Middle English. For example, the Old English *heofon* (heaven) became *heven*, and *seofon* (seven) became *seven*. Following this common phonetic pattern, Old English *sweoster* would have become ***swester*** in Middle English.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We don't have to just guess this. The native form *swester* did survive for a time and appears in Middle English texts, including the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. This confirms that this evolutionary path is correct. The word existed alongside the Norse borrowing *sister* for a while before *sister* eventually won out.\n\n4.  **Middle English to Modern English.** The final step is to project the Middle English form *swester* forward to today. We look for similar words to see how they evolved.\n    *   The Middle English short vowel `/e/` in a stressed syllable, as in *swester*, typically remained a short 'e' sound (/ɛ/) in Modern English, especially when followed by consonant clusters. Consider words like *rest*, *nest*, *west*, and *chester*. Their spellings and vowel sounds have remained very stable from Middle English.\n    *   The initial `sw-` cluster also would have likely been preserved, as seen in words like *swim*, *swan*, and *swing*. (Although in some cases like *sword* and *answer*, the 'w' sound was lost, this was not the general rule for the 'sw' cluster).\n    *   Therefore, there are no major phonetic shifts (like the Great Vowel Shift, which primarily affected long vowels) that would have drastically altered the word *swester*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the regular patterns of English sound change, if the native Old English word *sweoster* had not been replaced by the Old Norse loanword *systir*, it would have evolved through the Middle English form *swester* and arrived in Modern English with its spelling and pronunciation largely intact.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
