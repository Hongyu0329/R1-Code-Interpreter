The specific procedures involve a multi-phased approach starting with **emergency medical management** to control her diabetes and **emergency dental care** including wound debridement, infection control with antibiotics, and pain management. After medical stabilization and healing, definitive treatment planning can proceed.
The **cells of interest** are those critical for healing, which are compromised by her diabetes: **Neutrophils, Macrophages, Fibroblasts, and Osteoblasts**, as their impaired function leads to high infection risk and poor wound repair.
If deciding on a denture, the most appropriate choice would be a **Cobalt-Chrome framework Removable Partial Denture** with an **acrylic resin** base and teeth.
The **abutment teeth** would include the primary abutments, the **left second premolar** and **left central incisor**, as well as crucial secondary abutments for cross-arch stabilization, such as the **right central incisor/canine** and potentially the **left molars**. This design is necessary to provide adequate support, stability, and retention, and to counteract the heavy forces and long span created by the tooth loss and her Class III skeletal pattern.
