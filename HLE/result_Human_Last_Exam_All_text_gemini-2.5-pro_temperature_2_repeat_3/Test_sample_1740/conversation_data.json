    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and define the let-7 family.**\nThe question asks for the total number of members in the human let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family identified to date. The let-7 family is a group of short non-coding RNAs that are highly conserved across species and share a common sequence motif known as the \"seed sequence.\" This shared seed sequence allows them to regulate a similar set of target genes. Membership in the family is defined by this sequence homology.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the careful points and potential ambiguities.**\nThe main point of care is the definition of a \"member.\" This term can be interpreted in several ways:\n1.  **Distinct paralogs:** This refers to the unique miRNA types designated by a letter, such as let-7a, let-7b, etc., which have slightly different mature sequences but the same core function.\n2.  **Gene loci (precursors):** This refers to the number of distinct genes in the human genome that encode for let-7 family miRNAs. Since some paralogs are encoded by multiple genes, this number will be higher than the number of paralogs.\n3.  **Mature miRNAs:** Each precursor can produce two mature strands (-5p and -3p). This would lead to an even higher count and is not typically what is meant by \"family members.\"\n\nThe most precise and commonly cited method in genomics and scientific literature is to count the number of distinct gene loci that produce these miRNAs. We will use this method for the most accurate answer, referencing the authoritative miRNA database, miRBase.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate the human let-7 family members by gene locus.**\nAccording to miRBase, the central repository for miRNA data, the let-7 family in humans (*Homo sapiens*) includes several paralogs. We need to count the number of precursor genes for each.\n\n*   **let-7a:** Encoded by **3** distinct genes (`hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, `hsa-let-7a-3`).\n*   **let-7b:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7b`).\n*   **let-7c:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7c`).\n*   **let-7d:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7d`).\n*   **let-7e:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7e`).\n*   **let-7f:** Encoded by **2** distinct genes (`hsa-let-7f-1`, `hsa-let-7f-2`).\n*   **let-7g:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7g`).\n*   **let-7i:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7i`).\n*   **miR-98:** `miR-98` is classified as a member of the let-7 family due to high sequence identity. It is encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-mir-98`).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of members.**\nTo find the total number of identified members, we sum the number of genes for each paralog.\n\n*   Total = (genes for let-7a) + (genes for let-7b) + (genes for let-7c) + (genes for let-7d) + (genes for let-7e) + (genes for let-7f) + (genes for let-7g) + (genes for let-7i) + (genes for miR-98)\n*   Total = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n*   Total = 12\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final answer.**\nBased on the number of distinct precursor miRNA genes cataloged in the primary database miRBase, there are 12 members of the let-7 family identified in humans. While some publications might include other miRNAs like `miR-202`, raising the count to 13, the current consensus and miRBase classification place `miR-202` in a separate family. Therefore, 12 is the most accurate and widely accepted number.\n\n<<<12>>>"
