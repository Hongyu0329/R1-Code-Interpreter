    "An analysis of Arrhenius's impossibility theorems requires a clear understanding of both the population axiology in question (critical-level views) and the specific conditions of the theorem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a way of evaluating the goodness of a population. Its core formula is:\n\n*   **Value of a population = Sum of (welfare of each individual - critical level)**\n\nLet's denote welfare as `w` and the critical level as `c`. The value of adding a new person with welfare `w_new` to the world is `w_new - c`.\n\n*   If `w_new > c`, adding the person is a good thing (increases total value).\n*   If `w_new = c`, adding the person is neutral (does not change total value).\n*   If `w_new < c`, adding the person is a bad thing (decreases total value), even if their life is worth living (`w_new > 0`).\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis, we assume a \"standard\" critical-level view where the critical level `c` is a positive number (`c > 0`).\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's sixth theorem proves that five seemingly plausible conditions cannot all be satisfied at the same time. Let's define each condition from the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle is a combination of Pareto dominance and equality preference. It is generally satisfied by aggregative views like the critical-level view.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This gives some priority to the worse-off but avoids the problem of absolute priority (lexical views). Critical-level views, being aggregative, satisfy this.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This principle essentially states that \"quantity can outweigh quality.\" More formally: for any two welfare levels `x > y > 0`, and any number of people `n`, there is a sufficiently large number of people `m` such that a population of `m` people all at welfare level `y` is better than a population of `n` people all at welfare level `x`. It prevents a small \"elite\" group from being considered better than a massive, happy population.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This is a very basic principle. It states that, all else being equal, adding a person with a positive welfare level is better than adding a person with a negative welfare level (a life of suffering).\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This principle states that for any given population, adding a person with a *sufficiently high* quality of life makes the outcome better.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze which condition Critical-Level Views Violate\n\nLet's test our critical-level view (with `c > 0`) against each condition.\n\n*   **Testing Weak Non-Sadism:** Is adding a happy person (`w > 0`) better than adding a tortured person (`w' < 0`)?\n    *   Change in value from adding the happy person: `w - c`.\n    *   Change in value from adding the tortured person: `w' - c`.\n    *   Since `w > w'`, it is always true that `(w - c) > (w' - c)`.\n    *   **Result:** Weak Non-Sadism is **satisfied**.\n\n*   **Testing Weak Quality Addition:** Can we always make a population better by adding a person with a sufficiently high quality of life?\n    *   Yes. For any population, if we add a person with welfare `w_new` such that `w_new > c`, the total value increases by `w_new - c > 0`. Since we can always find such a welfare level, this condition is met.\n    *   **Result:** Weak Quality Addition is **satisfied**.\n\n*   **Testing Non-Elitism:** Can quantity always outweigh quality? Can we find a population of `m` people at a lower welfare `y` that is better than a population of `n` people at a higher welfare `x`?\n    *   Let's set up a test case based on our critical-level `c`. Choose welfare levels such that `x > c > y > 0`.\n    *   Value of Population A (`n` people at level `x`): `n * (x - c)`. Since `x > c`, this value is positive.\n    *   Value of Population B (`m` people at level `y`): `m * (y - c)`. Since `y < c`, the term `(y - c)` is **negative**. Therefore, the total value of Population B is negative.\n    *   The Non-Elitism condition requires that we can find some large number `m` such that Population B is better than Population A. This means we need:\n        `m * (y - c) > n * (x - c)`\n        `[A negative number] > [A positive number]`\n    *   This inequality can **never** be true. No matter how large we make `m`, Population B will always be judged as worse than Population A (and in fact, worse than an empty world). The critical-level view states that adding people below the critical level is a bad thing, so a large population of such people is very bad.\n    *   **Result:** Non-Elitism is **violated**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCritical-level views satisfy most of the standard desiderata in population ethics, such as Weak Non-Sadism and Weak Quality Addition. However, their defining feature—the positive critical level—creates a strict threshold. Any life lived below this threshold contributes negatively to the total value, making it impossible for a large quantity of \"pretty good\" lives (but below the critical level) to be judged as better than a smaller number of \"excellent\" lives (above the critical level). This is a direct violation of the Non-Elitism principle.\n\n<<<C>>>"
