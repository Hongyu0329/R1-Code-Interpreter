The ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio to maximize catalytic performance is not a single value but is dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal ratio is generally in the range of 0.2 to 0.3. For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), a lower ratio in the range of 0.05 to 0.15 is considered ideal.
