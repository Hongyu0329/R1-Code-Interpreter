    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of Dirichlet characters**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet the prime factorization of $N$ be $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$. Then any character $\\chi \\pmod N$ can be written as $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nTwo key properties of this decomposition are:\n1.  **Primitivity:** The character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$, denoted $o(\\chi)$, is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $o(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(o(\\chi_1), o(\\chi_2), \\dots, o(\\chi_k))$.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of such characters $\\chi$ that are primitive with conductor $N$ and have order 6.\n\n**Step 2: Factorize the conductor N**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\n$N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$\nThe prime power factors are $4, 9, 7, 11, 13$. So, any character $\\chi \\pmod{36036}$ can be written as $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conditions on the component characters**\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, the component characters must satisfy:\n1.  Each $\\chi_m$ (for $m \\in \\{4, 9, 7, 11, 13\\}$) must be a primitive character modulo $m$.\n2.  $\\operatorname{lcm}(o(\\chi_4), o(\\chi_9), o(\\chi_7), o(\\chi_{11}), o(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nLet's find the number of primitive characters for each modulus and their possible orders.\nThe number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ is $\\phi(p^a) - \\phi(p^{a-1})$ for $a \\ge 2$, and for a prime $p$, it is $p-2$ (all non-principal characters are primitive). The number of characters of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (if $k|n$) is $\\phi(k)$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($=2^2$):** The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(4) - \\phi(2) = 2-1 = 1$. The group of characters mod 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. The only primitive character has order 2. Let's call the number of primitive characters of order $k$ mod $m$ as $n_m^{(k)}$. So, $n_4^{(2)}=1$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($=3^2$):** The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6-2=4$. The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The orders of characters mod 9 are divisors of 6. The imprimitive characters are those induced from mod 3 (of which there is 1 of order 2) and mod 1 (of which there is 1 of order 1). Thus, the primitive characters are those of order 3 and 6. Number of elements of order $k$ in $C_6$ is $\\phi(k)$. So, $n_9^{(3)} = \\phi(3) = 2$ and $n_9^{(6)} = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7 (prime):** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All $7-2=5$ non-principal characters are primitive. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 6, greater than 1. So, $n_7^{(2)} = \\phi(2) = 1$, $n_7^{(3)} = \\phi(3) = 2$, and $n_7^{(6)} = \\phi(6) = 2$. Total: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11 (prime):** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. Primitive characters have orders that divide 10 and are greater than 1 (i.e., 2, 5, 10).\n\n*   **Modulo 13 (prime):** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. Primitive characters have orders that divide 12 and are greater than 1 (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 6, 12).\n\n**Step 4: Count the valid combinations of component characters**\nWe need to select one primitive character for each modulus $m \\in \\{4, 9, 7, 11, 13\\}$, say $\\chi_m$ with order $o_m$, such that their combination $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_m$ has order 6. This requires $\\operatorname{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\n\nThis lcm condition implies two things:\n(a) For each $m$, $o_m$ must be a divisor of 6.\n(b) The set of orders $\\{o_m\\}$ must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\nLet's find the number of \"admissible\" primitive characters for each modulus, i.e., those whose order divides 6.\n*   **Mod 4:** The primitive character has order 2. $2|6$, so it's admissible. Number of choices = 1.\n*   **Mod 9:** The primitive characters have orders 3 and 6. Both divide 6. All 4 are admissible. Number of choices = $n_9^{(3)} + n_9^{(6)} = 2+2=4$.\n*   **Mod 7:** The primitive characters have orders 2, 3, and 6. All divide 6. All 5 are admissible. Number of choices = $n_7^{(2)} + n_7^{(3)} + n_7^{(6)} = 1+2+2=5$.\n*   **Mod 11:** The primitive characters have orders 2, 5, 10. Only order 2 divides 6. There is $n_{11}^{(2)} = \\phi(2) = 1$ such character. Number of choices = 1.\n*   **Mod 13:** The primitive characters have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Those whose order divides 6 are of order 2, 3, or 6. Number of choices = $n_{13}^{(2)} + n_{13}^{(3)} + n_{13}^{(6)} = \\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\n\nNow we check condition (b).\nFor any valid combination, we must choose one character from each set of admissible characters.\n*   The character $\\chi_4$ must be chosen, and its order is 2. So the lcm will always be divisible by 2.\n*   The character $\\chi_9$ must be chosen from characters of order 3 or 6. In either case, its order is divisible by 3. So the lcm will always be divisible by 3.\n\nSince any combination of admissible primitive characters will have an lcm divisible by both 2 and 3, and since all component orders divide 6, the lcm must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such characters is the product of the number of admissible choices for each component.\nTotal number = (choices for mod 4) $\\times$ (choices for mod 9) $\\times$ (choices for mod 7) $\\times$ (choices for mod 11) $\\times$ (choices for mod 13)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal number = $100$"
