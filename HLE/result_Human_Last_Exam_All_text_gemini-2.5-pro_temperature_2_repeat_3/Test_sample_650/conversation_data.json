    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity for the given algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Function:**\n    The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` converts a non-negative integer `n` into its base `c` representation. It does this by repeatedly dividing `n` by the base `c` and recording the remainders. The remainders, in reverse order of calculation, form the digits of the base `c` representation.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋` calculates the integer quotient.\n    *   `a_i := x - qc` is equivalent to `a_i := x mod c`, calculating the remainder.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Core Operations and Input Size:**\n    *   The primary input that determines the workload is the integer `n`. The base `c` is a fixed parameter for a given execution.\n    *   The fundamental operations inside the algorithm are assignments (`:=`), comparisons (`>`), and arithmetic operations (`+`, `—`, `*`, `⌊/⌋`). In standard complexity analysis, we assume these operations take constant time, O(1), for numbers that fit within a computer's word size.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):** This step consists of a fixed number of operations: one assignment for `i`, one for `x`, one division and one assignment for `q`, and a multiplication, subtraction, and assignment for `a_0`. All of this executes exactly once and takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):** This is the main part of the algorithm. The total time complexity will be determined by how many times this loop executes.\n    *   **Step 2.1 (Loop Body):** Inside the loop, a fixed number of operations are performed in each iteration: one increment, two assignments, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. This means each iteration takes a constant amount of time, O(1).\n    *   **Step 3 (Return):** The algorithm returns a sequence of digits. The length of this sequence is `i+1`. The time taken to construct and return this sequence is proportional to its length.\n\n4.  **Determining the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   Let's trace the value of `q`. Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside the first iteration, `x` is updated to the current `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`. Effectively, the value passed to the next iteration is the previous value divided by `c`.\n    *   The sequence of values for `q` as the loop begins each iteration is approximately `n/c`, `n/c²`, `n/c³`, ..., `n/c^k`. (We ignore the floor function for asymptotic analysis as it doesn't change the overall order of magnitude).\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when the value `n/c^k` becomes less than 1.\n    *   So, we need to find the number of iterations, let's call it `k`, such that `n / c^(k+1) < 1`.\n    *   Rearranging the inequality gives `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   To solve for `k`, we can take the logarithm of both sides with base `c`: `log_c(n) < k+1`, which means `k > log_c(n) - 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of loop iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. More precisely, it is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` (if `n` is a power of `c`, it's `log_c(n) - 1`, but this detail doesn't affect the big-O notation).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Total Complexity:**\n    *   Total Time = (Time for Step 1) + (Number of Iterations × Time per Iteration) + (Time for Step 3)\n    *   The number of iterations is `O(log_c(n))`.\n    *   The time per iteration is `O(1)`.\n    *   The time for Step 1 is `O(1)`.\n    *   The number of digits `i+1` is also `O(log_c(n))`, so the time for Step 3 is `O(log_c(n))`.\n    *   T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) × O(1) + O(log_c(n))\n    *   T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(log_c(n))\n    *   The dominant term is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n### Final Conclusion on Complexity\n\nThe algorithm's runtime is proportional to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`. The number of digits is given by `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. Therefore, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is logarithmic with respect to the input value `n`.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
