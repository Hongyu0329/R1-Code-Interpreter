    "This puzzle requires us to determine a set of transformation rules that govern the movement of the number '2' within a grid of numbers '0', '1', and '2'. We can deduce these rules by analyzing the provided input-output pairs.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: The input and output are comma-separated strings representing rows of a grid. The core of the puzzle is to understand the physics governing the movement of the character '2'. The character '0' represents empty space, and '1' represents a solid obstacle.\n\n2.  **Analyze Input/Output Pair A**:\n    *   Input_A Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 2 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   Output_A Grid:\n        ```\n        2 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   **Observation**: The '2' at position (row=1, col=1) moves. Its original position becomes '0'. The '0' at (0,0) becomes '2'. This is not a simple swap. It suggests a multi-step process. Let's hypothesize a \"levitate and roll\" mechanism.\n        *   **Levitation**: The '2' is at (1,1). The space below it, (2,1), is a '1' (blocked). The space above it, (0,1), is a '0' (empty). This allows the '2' to levitate, swapping with the '0' above it. The grid becomes `021111,101111,111111`.\n        *   **Rolling**: After levitating, the '2' is at (0,1). The space to its left, (0,0), is a '0'. The '2' then rolls left into this empty space. This results in the final grid: `201111,101111,111111`. This matches `Output_A`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Input/Output Pair B**:\n    *   Input_B Grid (relevant section):\n        ```\n        ...0 0 0...  (Row 2)\n        ...0 0 2 1...  (Row 3)\n        ...1 1 1...  (Row 4)\n        ```\n    *   Output_B Grid (relevant section):\n        ```\n        ...0 0 0 2...  (Row 2)\n        ...0 0 0 1...  (Row 3)\n        ...1 1 1...  (Row 4)\n        ```\n    *   **Observation**: The '2' at (3,6) moves up and to the right, landing at (2,7). Let's test our \"levitate and roll\" hypothesis.\n        *   **Levitation**: The '2' is at (3,6). Below is '1' (blocked), above is '0' (empty). So, it levitates to (2,6). The grid at rows 2 and 3 becomes `...0020...` and `...0001...`.\n        *   **Rolling**: After levitating, the '2' is at (2,6). There are empty '0's to its left and right. In Pair A it rolled left. Here it rolls right. This implies the rolling direction is not fixed.\n        *   **Direction Rule**: Let's look at the neighbors of the '2' in its *original* position (3,6). The neighbor to the left, (3,5), is '0'. The neighbor to the right, (3,7), is '1'. A plausible rule is that the roll direction is *opposite* to the side with an adjacent opening on the original row. Here, the opening is on the left, so it rolls right.\n        *   **Applying the rule**: After levitating to (2,6), the '2' rolls right into the adjacent '0' at (2,7), resulting in the configuration `...0002...` on row 2. This matches `Output_B`.\n\n4.  **Consolidate the Rules**:\n    *   **Rule 1 (Levitation)**: A '2' at position `(r, c)` will levitate (swap with the '0' above it) if the space above it `(r-1, c)` is '0' AND the space below it `(r+1, c)` is not '0'.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Roll Direction)**: The direction of the roll is determined *before* levitation, based on the neighbors of the '2' in its original row `r`.\n        *   If left neighbor `(r, c-1)` is '0' and right `(r, c+1)` is not '0' -> Roll **RIGHT**.\n        *   If right neighbor `(r, c+1)` is '0' and left `(r, c-1)` is not '0' -> Roll **LEFT**.\n        *   In all other cases (both neighbors '0' or neither is '0'), the default direction is **LEFT**.\n    *   **Rule 3 (Rolling)**: After levitating, the '2' rolls as far as possible in the determined direction on its new row, swapping with adjacent '0's until it hits a non-'0' character or the edge of the grid.\n    *   **(Implicit Rule) Gravity**: A '2' would fall if there was a '0' directly below it. This is the primary action, but it doesn't occur in any of the examples provided.\n\n5.  **Solve for Input C**:\n    *   Input_C Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 2 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   **Apply the Rules**:\n        1.  The '2' is at (1,4). Gravity check fails (below is '1').\n        2.  **Levitation**: `grid[0,4]` is '0' and `grid[2,4]` is '1'. The condition for levitation is met.\n        3.  **Roll Direction**: Check neighbors of the '2' at its original position (1,4). Left neighbor `(1,3)` is '1'. Right neighbor `(1,5)` is '0'. According to Rule 2, since the right side is open, the direction of roll will be **LEFT**.\n        4.  **Execute Transformation**:\n            *   First, the '2' at (1,4) levitates, swapping with the '0' at (0,4). The grid becomes:\n                ```\n                0 0 0 0 2 0\n                0 1 1 1 0 0  <-- Original '2' position is now '0'\n                1 1 1 1 1 1\n                ```\n            *   Next, the '2' at (0,4) rolls LEFT as far as it can. It will swap with the '0' at (0,3), then (0,2), then (0,1), and finally (0,0).\n        5.  **Final Grid State**:\n            ```\n            2 0 0 0 0 0\n            0 1 1 1 0 0\n            1 1 1 1 1 1\n            ```\n    *   **Construct the Output String**: Combining the rows with commas gives `200000,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<200000,011100,111111>>>"
