    "This problem asks for the number of self-avoiding walks of length 10 on a 2D square lattice, starting from the origin.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Definition of a Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW)**\n\n*   **Lattice:** A Manhattan lattice is a 2D grid of points (x, y) with integer coordinates.\n*   **Walk:** A walk of length `n` is a sequence of `n+1` points `v_0, v_1, ..., v_n`, where `v_0` is the starting point (conventionally the origin (0,0)).\n*   **Step:** Each point `v_i` in the sequence must be a direct neighbor of the previous point `v_{i-1}`. On a square lattice, this means it's one step up, down, left, or right.\n*   **Self-Avoiding:** The key constraint is that the walk must not visit any point more than once. All points `v_0, v_1, ..., v_n` must be distinct.\n\nWe are asked to find `a(10)`, the total number of such walks with `n=10`.\n\n**2. Calculating for Small Values of n**\n\nLet's compute the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` to understand the problem's complexity.\n\n*   **n = 1: `a(1)`**\n    *   Starting at (0,0), we can take one step in any of the 4 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n    *   The possible walks are: `(0,0)->(0,1)`, `(0,0)->(0,-1)`, `(0,0)->(-1,0)`, `(0,0)->(1,0)`.\n    *   All 4 are valid.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **n = 2: `a(2)`**\n    *   For each of the 4 paths of length 1, we take another step.\n    *   Let's consider the path `(0,0)->(1,0)`. From the point (1,0), we have 4 neighboring points: (1,1), (1,-1), (2,0), and (0,0).\n    *   The self-avoiding condition means we cannot step back to (0,0).\n    *   This leaves 3 valid moves: to (1,1), (1,-1), or (2,0).\n    *   By symmetry, this is true for all 4 initial paths.\n    *   `a(2) = 4 (initial choices) * 3 (continuations) = 12`\n\n*   **n = 3: `a(3)`**\n    *   Let's take a 2-step path, for example, `(0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)`. The visited points are (0,0) and (1,0).\n    *   From (2,0), the neighbors are (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). The move back to (1,0) is forbidden. The other 3 are valid.\n    *   Let's take a different 2-step path, `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)`. The visited points are (0,0) and (1,0).\n    *   From (1,1), the neighbors are (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). The move back to (1,0) is forbidden. The other 3 are valid.\n    *   For any 2-step SAW, the endpoint has 3 valid continuations that do not immediately form a loop.\n    *   `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n*   **n = 4: `a(4)`**\n    *   This is where it gets complicated because the path's history starts to matter.\n    *   **Case 1: \"Straight\" path** `(0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0)`.\n        *   From (3,0), the neighbors are (2,0), (4,0), (3,1), (3,-1).\n        *   (2,0) is visited. This leaves **3** valid moves.\n    *   **Case 2: \"U-turn\" path** `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1)`.\n        *   From (0,1), the neighbors are (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), (0,0).\n        *   Two points, (1,1) and (0,0), are already on the path. This leaves only **2** valid moves.\n    *   Since the number of possible next steps depends on the shape of the path so far, we cannot use a simple multiplication. We must count the number of each type of path.\n    *   A careful enumeration shows that out of the 36 paths of length 3, 24 of them have 3 continuations and 12 of them have 2 continuations.\n    *   `a(4) = (24 * 3) + (12 * 2) = 72 + 24 = 96`... Wait, my manual calculation here is error-prone. Let's re-verify with the calculation done in the thinking step. By symmetry, starting with (0,0)->(1,0), there were 9 paths of length 3. Two of these had 2 continuations, and seven had 3. This gives `2*2 + 7*3 = 25` continuations. Total `a(4) = 4 * 25 = 100`. This is the correct value.\n\n**3. Finding a(10)**\n\nManual calculation beyond n=4 or n=5 is infeasible due to the rapid growth in the number of path configurations. There is no simple closed-form formula for `a(n)`. This is a well-known problem in computational physics and combinatorics. The values have been computed and tabulated using sophisticated algorithms (like backtracking on a computer).\n\nThe sequence `a(n)` for the square lattice is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. We can look up the value for n=10 from this established source.\n\nThe known values for `a(n)` are:\n*   `a(1) = 4`\n*   `a(2) = 12`\n*   `a(3) = 36`\n*   `a(4) = 100`\n*   `a(5) = 284`\n*   `a(6) = 780`\n*   `a(7) = 2,172`\n*   `a(8) = 5,916`\n*   `a(9) = 16,268`\n*   **`a(10) = 44,100`**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
