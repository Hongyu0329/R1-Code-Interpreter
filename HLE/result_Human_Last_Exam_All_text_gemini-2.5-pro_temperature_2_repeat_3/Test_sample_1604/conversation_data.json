    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist and the Task**\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Thompson, more famously known as Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was a prominent British painter of military and historical scenes. The task is to identify which of the battles she depicted in her paintings occurred latest in history, not when the painting itself was created.\n\n**Step 2: List Major Battle Paintings by Lady Butler**\nWe need to create a list of her famous paintings and the historical events they portray.\n\n*   ***Scotland Forever!***: Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo.\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras***: Shows a British infantry square during the Battle of Quatre Bras.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army***: Shows William Brydon, the sole survivor of a 16,500-strong army, arriving at the gates of Jalalabad. This was the culmination of the 1842 retreat from Kabul.\n*   ***The Roll Call***: Depicts a roll call of the Grenadier Guards during the Crimean War, specifically after the Battle of Inkerman.\n*   ***Balaclava***: Shows the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift***: Portrays the stand of the 24th Regiment of Foot during the Battle of Rorke's Drift.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!***: Depicts an incident during the First Boer War at the Battle of Laing's Nek.\n*   ***The Camel Corps***: Shows the British Camel Corps during the Gordon Relief Expedition, part of the Mahdist War in Sudan. The key engagement was the Battle of Abu Klea.\n*   ***A Rescue*** or ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards***: Lady Butler painted scenes from the First World War late in her career. These paintings depict the British Expeditionary Force during the Retreat from Mons.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Historical Date of Each Depicted Battle**\nNow, we must assign a date to each historical event.\n\n*   Battle of Quatre Bras: **June 16, 1815**\n*   Battle of Waterloo: **June 18, 1815**\n*   Retreat from Kabul (First Anglo-Afghan War): **January 1842**\n*   Battle of Inkerman (Crimean War): **November 5, 1854**\n*   Battle of Balaclava (Crimean War): **October 25, 1854**\n*   Battle of Rorke's Drift (Anglo-Zulu War): **January 22-23, 1879**\n*   Battle of Laing's Nek (First Boer War): **January 28, 1881**\n*   Battle of Abu Klea (Mahdist War): **January 17, 1885**\n*   The Retreat from Mons (World War I): **August 23 – September 5, 1914**\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Dates and Identify the Latest**\nArranging the events chronologically helps in identifying the latest one.\n\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras (1815)\n2.  Battle of Waterloo (1815)\n3.  Retreat from Kabul (1842)\n4.  Crimean War Battles (1854)\n5.  Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879)\n6.  Battle of Laing's Nek (1881)\n7.  Battle of Abu Klea (1885)\n8.  **The Retreat from Mons (1914)**\n\nComparing the dates, the latest historical event is the Retreat from Mons, which took place in 1914 during the early stages of World War I.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Event Date vs. Painting Date**: It is crucial to focus on the date of the battle being depicted, not the date Lady Butler painted it. For example, *The Roll Call* (depicting an 1854 event) was painted in 1874.\n*   **Specificity of the Event**: While a painting might have a general title like *The Roll Call*, it refers to a specific campaign (Crimean War) and battle (aftermath of Inkerman).\n*   **Artist's Lifespan**: Lady Butler lived until 1933, well into the 20th century. While most famous for her Victorian-era paintings, her long life allowed her to cover events from the First World War. This is a key piece of information that prevents stopping the search at the colonial wars of the 1880s.\n*   **Identifying WWI Paintings**: Her World War I paintings are less famous than her 19th-century works, so it is important to be aware of their existence. Titles like *\"A Rescue: an episode in the retreat from Mons\"* or *\"In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\"* directly point to this conflict.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy listing Lady Butler's famous battle paintings and dating the events they show, we can conclude that the paintings depicting the **Retreat from Mons** in 1914 portray the latest historical battle in her body of work.\n\n<<<The Retreat from Mons"
