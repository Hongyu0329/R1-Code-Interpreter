    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Define the Problem**\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\nThe conditions on these polynomials are:\n*   $f'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n*   $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n\nThese conditions imply that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all $x$.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ for which $h(x) = x$. So we want to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**2. Determine the Degree of the Equation**\nLet $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\nLet $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$:\nDegree($h$) = Degree($f$) $\\times$ Degree($g$) = $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) = x$. Let's define a new function $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The fixed points are the roots of $H(x)=0$.\nThe leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a_3(b_3x^3)^3 = a_3b_3^3x^9$.\nSo, $H(x) = a_3b_3^3x^9 + \\dots - x$.\nThe degree of $H(x)$ is 9.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is at most 9.\n\n**3. Check if 9 Fixed Points are Achievable**\nNow we must determine if it's possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $H(x)=0$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n\nFor a polynomial $H(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $H'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots. Let's analyze $H'(x)$.\n$H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = h'(x) - 1$.\nUsing the chain rule, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nSo, $H'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to checking if the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ can have 8 distinct real roots for some choice of $f$ and $g$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Derivative Equation**\nLet's find the degree of the polynomial $P(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n*   $f(x)$ is degree 3, so $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$ is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2).\n*   $g(x)$ is degree 3.\n*   The composition $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $\\deg(f') \\times \\deg(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$ is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2).\n*   The product $P(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $\\deg(f'(g(x))) + \\deg(g'(x)) = 6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nSo, $H'(x) = P(x) - 1$ is a polynomial of degree 8. An 8th-degree polynomial can have at most 8 real roots. Thus, it is theoretically possible for $H'(x)$ to have 8 distinct real roots.\n\n**5. Conditions on the Derivatives**\nThe conditions $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ impose constraints on the coefficients of the polynomials.\nFor the quadratic $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$ to be always positive, its graph must be a parabola opening upwards and never crossing the x-axis.\n1.  The leading coefficient must be positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$.\n2.  The discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 < 12a_1a_3 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\nSimilarly, for $g'(x) > 0$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\nThese conditions define open sets in the space of coefficients, meaning there is significant freedom to choose the polynomials.\n\n**6. Feasibility of 9 Roots**\nTo have 9 roots for $H(x)=0$, we need to show that there exist $f$ and $g$ satisfying the conditions such that:\n1.  $H'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1 = 0$ has 8 distinct real roots. This means the graph of $P(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ must intersect the line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points.\n2.  These 8 roots for $H'(x)$ create 8 critical points for $H(x)$, which must be alternating local maxima and minima.\n3.  We need to be able to make the local maxima of $H(x)$ positive and the local minima negative.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of $P(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$. As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$:\n*   $g'(x) \\sim 3b_3x^2 \\to +\\infty$ (since $b_3 > 0$).\n*   $g(x) \\to \\pm\\infty$ (since $b_3 > 0$).\n*   $f'(y) \\sim 3a_3y^2 \\to +\\infty$ as $y \\to \\pm\\infty$ (since $a_3 > 0$).\n*   So, $P(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n\nFor $P(x)=1$ to have 8 roots, the graph of $P(x)$ must dip below $y=1$ multiple times. Specifically, since $P(x)$ goes to $+\\infty$ at both ends, it must have 4 local minima whose values are less than 1, and 3 local maxima whose values are greater than 1. This requires $P'(x)$ to have 7 distinct real roots.\n\nThe derivative $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. A general polynomial of degree 7 can be constructed to have 7 distinct real roots. While the coefficients of $P'(x)$ are constrained by the structure of $f$ and $g$, there is enough freedom in choosing the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ to create such a \"wavy\" polynomial $P(x)$. We can make the minimal values of $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ arbitrarily close to zero, which allows the product $P(x)$ to take values very close to zero, and thus well below 1.\n\nIf we can construct such a $P(x)$ where $P(x)=1$ has 8 roots, say $x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_8$, then $H(x)$ has 8 critical points. Since $H(x) \\to \\pm\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, this creates 4 local maxima and 4 local minima. Let their values be $M_1, m_1, M_2, m_2, \\dots, M_4, m_4$.\nThe value of $H(x)$ can be shifted vertically by changing the constant term $a_0$ in $f(x)$, as this does not affect $H'(x)$.\n$H(x) = f(g(x)) - x = (a_3g(x)^3 + \\dots + a_1g(x) + a_0) - x$. Changing $a_0$ changes $H(x)$ by the same amount.\nWe can therefore adjust $a_0$ to ensure all local maxima $M_i$ are positive and all local minima $m_i$ are negative.\nThis configuration guarantees a root before the first maximum, a root between each adjacent max/min pair, and a root after the last minimum, for a total of $1 + 7 + 1 = 9$ roots.\n\nConclusion: The degree of the polynomial equation $f(g(x))=x$ is 9, so there can be at most 9 fixed points. The conditions on the derivatives do not restrict this possibility. It is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in 9 fixed points.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
