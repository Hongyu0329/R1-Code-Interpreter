    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene)**\n    *   Structure: CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂\n    *   Classification: It is a conjugated diene, meaning it has two double bonds separated by a single bond. It provides the \"4\" component (4 π-electrons) in a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**\n    *   Structure: CCl₂=CF₂\n    *   Classification: It is a substituted alkene (ethene). It acts as a dienophile, the \"2\" component (2 π-electrons) in a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Reaction Type: Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   The combination of a conjugated diene and a dienophile is characteristic of a Diels-Alder reaction. This is a pericyclic, [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a six-membered ring. The electron-withdrawing halogen substituents on the dienophile make it particularly reactive for this type of reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Connectivity of the Product**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction proceeds through a cyclic transition state where three π-bonds are broken and two new σ-bonds and one new π-bond are formed.\n*   Let's number the carbons of the reactants:\n    *   Butadiene: C¹H₂=C²H−C³H=C⁴H₂\n    *   Dienophile: CªCl₂=CᵇF₂\n*   The reaction mechanism involves the following bond changes:\n    1.  A new single bond (σ-bond) forms between C¹ of the diene and one carbon of the dienophile (e.g., Cª).\n    2.  A new single bond (σ-bond) forms between C⁴ of the diene and the other carbon of the dienophile (Cᵇ).\n    3.  The π-bond between C¹ and C² of the diene is broken.\n    4.  The π-bond between C³ and C⁴ of the diene is broken.\n    5.  The π-bond between Cª and Cᵇ of the dienophile is broken.\n    6.  A new π-bond is formed between C² and C³ of the original diene.\n\nThis process results in a six-membered ring composed of atoms C¹-C²-C³-C⁴-Cᵇ-Cª.\n\n**Step 3: Draw the Structure of the Product**\nFollowing the connectivity established in Step 2, the product is a cyclohexene derivative.\n*   The ring contains a double bond between the carbons that were C² and C³ of butadiene.\n*   The carbons that were part of the dienophile (Cª and Cᵇ) are now saturated (sp³-hybridized) and are part of the ring. They are adjacent to each other.\n*   The substituents originally on the dienophile remain attached to their respective carbons. One ring carbon is attached to two chlorine atoms (-CCl₂), and the adjacent carbon is attached to two fluorine atoms (-CF₂).\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      (A six-membered ring with one double bond)\n        ||\n       /  \\\n      |    |\n      \\    /\n       C-C\n      / \\ / \\\n     Cl Cl F F\n```\nMore precisely, a cyclohexene ring with CCl₂ and CF₂ groups on adjacent saturated carbons.\n\n**Step 4: Name the Product Using IUPAC Nomenclature**\nNaming the product correctly requires following IUPAC rules carefully.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Ring:** The parent structure is a six-membered ring with one double bond, which is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  **Number the Ring:**\n    *   The carbons of the double bond must be assigned the lowest possible numbers, so they are C-1 and C-2.\n    *   We then number the rest of the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (positions).\n    *   Regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise, the CCl₂ and CF₂ groups will be on positions 4 and 5. The locant set is {4, 4, 5, 5}.\n3.  **Apply the Tie-breaker Rule:** Since the locant set is the same for both numbering directions, we use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The substituent that comes first alphabetically gets the lower number.\n    *   The substituents are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\".\n    *   Alphabetically, 'dichl**o**ro' comes before 'difl**u**oro'.\n    *   Therefore, the CCl₂ group must be assigned the lower number, which is 4. The CF₂ group is assigned position 5.\n4.  **Assemble the Full Name:** We list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants.\n    *   4,4-dichloro\n    *   5,5-difluoro\n    *   The parent name is cyclohex-1-ene (the \"-1-\" is often omitted when there's no ambiguity, as in cyclohexene).\n\nPutting it all together, the final name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   **Reaction Identification:** Correctly identifying the reaction as a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The diene is symmetric, so only one regioisomeric product is possible, simplifying the analysis.\n*   **Product Structure:** Accurately determining the connectivity of the resulting six-membered ring.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** Applying the rules for numbering the parent ring and substituents, especially the tie-breaker rule based on alphabetical order when locant sets are identical.\n\nThe final product is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
