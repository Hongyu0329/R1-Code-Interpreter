    "An analysis of the user's question is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core mathematical problem.**\nThe user is asking to compute the determinant of the following 3x3 matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the provided context.**\nThe problem statement includes the phrases \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver\" and \"\\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n*   The matrix A is indeed related to the Markov quiver; it is the Cartan matrix associated with the rank 3 cluster algebra of Markov type, whose underlying quiver is a cyclically oriented triangle.\n*   The term \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) refers to a Markov number (the sequence is 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, ...). This is contextual information that specifies a particular aspect or state of the system described by the quiver, but the matrix A itself is explicitly given.\n*   **Crucial Point:** The calculation of the determinant of matrix A depends only on the elements of A itself. The contextual information is not required for the computation, so we can proceed by focusing solely on the matrix.\n\n**Step 3: Choose a method for calculating the determinant.**\nFor a 3x3 matrix, we can use the Sarrus' rule or the cofactor expansion method. A quick check for linear dependencies among rows or columns is also a very efficient method if a dependency is obvious.\n\n**Step 4: Execute the calculation (Method 1: Cofactor Expansion).**\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\) is calculated as \\( a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\).\nApplying this to matrix A:\n*   `a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n*   `d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n*   `g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n\nThe determinant is:\n\\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + 1 \\cdot ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - 1 \\cdot ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1)) \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (4 - 1) + 1 \\cdot (-2 - 1) - 1 \\cdot (1 + 2) \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (3) + 1 \\cdot (-3) - 1 \\cdot (3) \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 0 \\)\n\n**Step 5: Verification (Method 2: Checking for Linear Dependence).**\nA matrix has a determinant of 0 if and only if its rows or columns are linearly dependent. Let's examine the sum of the columns of matrix A.\nLet \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) be the columns of A.\n\\( C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 - 1 - 1 \\\\ -1 + 2 - 1 \\\\ -1 - 1 + 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\nSince the sum of the three column vectors is the zero vector, the columns are linearly dependent.\n*   **Careful Point:** A non-trivial linear combination of columns results in the zero vector, which is a sufficient condition for the determinant to be zero.\nThis verification confirms the result from the first method.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe calculation and verification both robustly show that the determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
