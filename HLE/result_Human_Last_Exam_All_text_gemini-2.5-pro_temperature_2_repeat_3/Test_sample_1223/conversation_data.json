    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question and define the terms\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of a specific topological feature (composants) of a specific space (the Stone-Cech remainder). Let's define the key terms:\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space. Let's denote it by $X$.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditarily Indecomposable (HI) Continuum:** A continuum where every non-degenerate subcontinuum is indecomposable.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, $\\beta Y$ is the largest compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace. Every continuous bounded function from $Y$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ extends uniquely to a continuous function on $\\beta Y$.\n*   **The Space in Question:** We start with an HI metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$. We consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. This space is locally compact but not compact.\n*   **The Stone-Cech Remainder:** This is the set of points added to $Y$ to form its Stone-Cech compactification, i.e., $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. Composants partition the space $K$.\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum possible number of composants of the remainder $R$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of the remainder $R$\nWe need to understand the topological nature of $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n1.  **$R$ is a compact continuum.**\n    The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected. This is because $X$ is a continuum (of topological dimension at least 1), and removing a single point from such a space does not disconnect it. (A point $x$ disconnects a continuum $X$ if and only if $x$ is a cut point. An indecomposable continuum has no cut points). Since $Y$ is a connected, locally compact, non-compact space, its Stone-Cech remainder $R$ is a continuum (i.e., it is compact and connected).\n\n2.  **$R$ is indecomposable (in fact, hereditarily indecomposable).**\n    This is a deep result in continuum theory. A theorem, attributed to H. Cook, D. Bellamy, and further refined by P. Minc, states that if $X$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum and $x \\in X$, then the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is also a hereditarily indecomposable continuum. Since HI implies indecomposable, $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n3.  **$R$ is non-degenerate (contains more than one point).**\n    The remainder $R$ would consist of a single point if and only if $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ (which is $X$ itself). This occurs if and only if the space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is pseudocompact (i.e., every real-valued continuous function on it is bounded).\n    Let's check if $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is pseudocompact. Consider the function $f: Y \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(y) = 1/d(y,x)$, where $d$ is the metric on $X$. This function is continuous on $Y$. As $y$ gets closer to $x$, $d(y,x) \\to 0$, so $f(y) \\to \\infty$. Thus, $f$ is an unbounded continuous function, which means $Y$ is not pseudocompact. Consequently, the remainder $R$ is non-degenerate.\n\n4.  **$R$ is metrizable.**\n    A key theorem states that for a separable metrizable space $Y$, a compact subset of its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is metrizable if and only if it is a $G_\\delta$-set (i.e., a countable intersection of open sets) in $\\beta Y$.\n    *   First, our space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is separable and metrizable because $X$ is a metric continuum (and thus separable), and $Y$ is a subspace of $X$.\n    *   Second, let's show $R$ is a $G_\\delta$-set in $\\beta Y$. The one-point compactification of $Y$ is $X$. There is a continuous canonical map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$ that collapses the remainder $R$ to the point $x$ and is a homeomorphism on $Y$. Thus, $R = \\pi^{-1}(\\{x\\})$. Since $X$ is a metric space, any single point $\\{x\\}$ is a closed set, and any closed set in a metric space is a $G_\\delta$-set. For example, $\\{x\\} = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty B(x, 1/n)$, where $B(x, 1/n)$ is the open ball of radius $1/n$ around $x$. Since $\\pi$ is continuous, the preimage $R = \\pi^{-1}(\\{x\\}) = \\pi^{-1}(\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty B(x, 1/n)) = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty \\pi^{-1}(B(x, 1/n))$ is a countable intersection of open sets in $\\beta Y$. Thus, $R$ is a $G_\\delta$-set.\n    *   Therefore, $R$ is a metrizable space.\n\n### Step 3: Count the composants of $R$\nWe have established that for any HI metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate, indecomposable, metric continuum.\n\nNow we use another fundamental theorem from continuum theory:\n*   **Every non-degenerate, indecomposable, metric continuum has uncountably many disjoint composants. The cardinality of the set of composants is precisely $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).**\n\nThis can be proven using the Baire Category Theorem. Each composant is an $F_\\sigma$-set (a countable union of closed sets), which is a set of the first category in the continuum. The continuum itself, being a complete metric space, is of the second category. It cannot be expressed as a countable union of first category sets. Thus, there must be uncountably many composants. A more detailed analysis shows the cardinality is exactly $c$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe analysis in the previous steps shows that for *any* choice of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is exactly $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nSince the number of composants is always the same fixed value ($c$), the maximum possible number is also this value.\n\nThe cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $c$."
