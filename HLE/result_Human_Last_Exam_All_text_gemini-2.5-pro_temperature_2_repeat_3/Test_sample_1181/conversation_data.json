    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key identifying detail is a very specific feeling: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This isn't just missing Earth, but a feeling of shame associated with forgetting or no longer being able to recall a fundamental earthly experience.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Context**\n*   **Film:** *Solaris* (1972). This is crucial, as the themes and dialogue can differ from the original 1961 novel by Stanis≈Çaw Lem or the 2002 remake. Tarkovsky's version is particularly known for its long, meditative opening on Earth, which establishes the very sensory experiences (rain, water, rustling leaves) that are later contrasted with the sterile environment of the space station.\n*   **Theme:** The feeling described in the question taps into a central theme of the film: humanity's alienation from nature and itself when removed from its home environment. It's about the loss of simple, grounding human experiences in the pursuit of scientific knowledge in a vast, unknowable cosmos.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Character (the Answer Choices)**\n\n*   **A. Kris (Kris Kelvin):** As the protagonist, Kris is certainly experiencing a profound dislocation. The film opens with him on Earth, surrounded by the very nature that the character in the question misses. However, Kris's primary emotional struggle throughout the film is centered on his past guilt regarding his wife, Hari, and his relationship with his father. While he misses Earth, his shame is more personal and focused on Hari's suicide.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation created by the sentient ocean of Solaris from Kris's memories. She has no authentic memory of Earth herself. Her entire existence and developing consciousness are confined to the space station. Therefore, she could not miss or be ashamed of forgetting something she never experienced.\n\n*   **C. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is one of the two scientists who have survived the strange phenomena on the station long before Kris arrives. He is world-weary, cynical, and often drunk. He acts as a philosophical guide for Kris, explaining the situation and musing on humanity's purpose. His long tenure on the station makes him the most likely candidate to have become so alienated from Earth that he can no longer remember it properly. His character is the one who most overtly discusses the philosophical and existential consequences of their mission. A famous monologue of his directly addresses this shame. He tells Kris he drinks to deaden his shame, a shame born from having forgotten the most basic things about Earth, like the sound of rustling leaves.\n\n*   **D. Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is the other surviving scientist. He represents a cold, rationalist, scientific approach. He is almost entirely focused on studying the Solaris phenomenon and sees the \"visitors\" as aberrations to be experimented on or destroyed. It would be very out of character for the rigid and emotionally repressed Sartorius to express such a poetic and vulnerable sentiment of shame and loss.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Gibarian is the scientist who commits suicide just before Kris's arrival. We see him only in a recorded message and as a \"visitor.\" In his message, he expresses desperation and warns Kris, but his dialogue does not include this specific sentiment about shame and rustling leaves.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on Evidence**\nThe character who explicitly voices his shame over forgetting the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. This line is part of a key philosophical monologue where he reveals his deep-seated disillusionment and feeling of loss after spending so much time isolated in space. He has forgotten the essential, sensory details of his own world, and this fills him with shame.\n\n<<<C>>>"
