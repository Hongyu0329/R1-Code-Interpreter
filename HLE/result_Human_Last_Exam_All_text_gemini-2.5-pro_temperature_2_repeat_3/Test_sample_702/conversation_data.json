    "An analysis of the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map**\n\n*   **Source Space:** Let $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^n$ is the loop space on the n-sphere, $S^n$. The connectivity of $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n    *   $X \\wedge Y$ is the smash product. For CW complexes, if $X$ is $c_X$-connected and $Y$ is $c_Y$-connected, then $X \\wedge Y$ is $(c_X + c_Y + 1)$-connected.\n    *   Therefore, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1)=7$-connected.\n    *   $\\Sigma X$ is the reduced suspension of $X$. Suspension increases connectivity by 1.\n    *   Thus, the source space $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1)=8$-connected. This means $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ for all $i \\le 8$.\n\n*   **Target Space:** Let $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homeomorphic to $S^{10}$.\n    *   So, $B = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2)=8$. This means $\\pi_i(B) = 0$ for all $i \\le 8$.\n\n*   **The Map:** The map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is a standard map in homotopy theory, often referred to as the James-Samelson map. It is the adjoint of a map $g: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ constructed using the Samelson product and properties of cofibration sequences.\n    This map $g$ can be understood as a composition involving:\n    1.  The Samelson product map $S: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)$, induced by the commutator $[\\alpha, \\beta] = \\alpha\\beta\\alpha^{-1}\\beta^{-1}$.\n    2.  The map induced by the cofibration sequence $S^4 \\vee S^6 \\xrightarrow{i} S^4 \\times S^6 \\xrightarrow{p} S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$. Looping this twice gives maps $\\Omega^2(S^4 \\vee S^6) \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\times S^6) \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    The composite map is effectively $g = \\Omega^2(p \\circ i) \\circ S'$, for a map $S'$ related to the Samelson product.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the homotopy class of the map**\n\nThe crucial observation is that the composite map $p \\circ i : S^4 \\vee S^6 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is null-homotopic. This is because the smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is formed by taking $S^4 \\times S^6$ and collapsing the subspace $S^4 \\vee S^6$ to a point. The map $i$ sends $S^4 \\vee S^6$ to itself inside $S^4 \\times S^6$, and the map $p$ then collapses this exact subspace.\nSince $p \\circ i$ is a null-homotopic map, any map obtained by applying functors to it, such as $\\Omega^2(p \\circ i)$, will also be null-homotopic. As a result, the overall map $g$ is null-homotopic, which in turn implies its adjoint $f$ is also null-homotopic.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the map**\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is defined as $k$ if its homotopy fiber, $F_f$, is $(k-1)$-connected.\nFor a null-homotopic map $f: A \\to B$, the homotopy fiber has the homotopy type of the product of the source space and the loop space of the target space:\n$F_f \\simeq A \\times \\Omega B$.\n\nWe now determine the connectivity of $F_f$:\n*   The connectivity of a product space is the minimum of the connectivities of its factors.\n    conn($F_f$) = min(conn($A$), conn($\\Omega B$)).\n*   From Step 1, we found conn($A$) = 8.\n*   The space $\\Omega B$ is $\\Omega(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\n*   The connectivity of $\\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is $(10-2-1) = 7$.\n*   Therefore, conn($F_f$) = min(8, 7) = 7.\n\nThe homotopy fiber $F_f$ is 7-connected.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nThe connectivity of the map $f$ is given by $k = \\text{conn}(F_f) + 1$.\nConnectivity = $7 + 1 = 8$.\n\nWe can also verify this using the definition based on homotopy groups. A map $f:A \\to B$ is $k$-connected if $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ is an isomorphism for $i<k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.\n*   For $i<9$, both $\\pi_i(A)$ and $\\pi_i(B)$ are 0 (since they are both 8-connected). The map $f_*: 0 \\to 0$ is an isomorphism. So the connectivity is at least 9 according to this definition. Let's recheck this. Let's test for $k=8$.\n*   Is $f$ 8-connected? We need $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ to be an iso for $i<8$ and an epi for $i=8$.\n    *   For $i < 8$, $\\pi_i(A) = \\pi_i(B) = 0$, so $f_*$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   For $i=8$, $\\pi_8(A)=\\pi_8(B)=0$, so $f_*$ is an isomorphism, which is also an epimorphism.\n    Thus, the map is 8-connected.\n*   Is $f$ 9-connected? We would need $f_*$ to be an isomorphism for $i<9$ and an epimorphism for $i=9$.\n    *   It is an iso for $i<9$ as shown.\n    *   For $i=9$, we have $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_9(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $f$ is null-homotopic, $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is the zero map, $0: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. This map is not an epimorphism.\n    Therefore, the map is not 9-connected.\n\nThe largest integer $k$ for which the condition holds is 8."
