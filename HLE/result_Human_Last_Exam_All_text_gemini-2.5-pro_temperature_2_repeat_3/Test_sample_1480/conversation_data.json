    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The goal is to determine the \"rule activation level\" for a specific rule (let's say rule `k`) in an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy System.\n\n2.  **Define Rule Activation Level:** In any fuzzy logic system, the activation level of a rule (also called firing strength, firing level, or rule weight) is the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the rule is satisfied by the system's current inputs. This value determines how much influence the rule has on the final output.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: This notation, `Phi_k(x′)` (sometimes written as `w_k(x')`), represents the computed firing strength or activation level of the k-th rule for a given input vector `x'`. It is the result of evaluating the \"IF\" part of the rule.\n    *   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: This notation represents the membership degree of a specific value `y_j` in the j-th consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` of the k-th rule. The consequent is the \"THEN\" part of the rule. This value is used *after* the activation level has been calculated, typically in the implication or defuzzification stages, but it does not determine the activation level itself.\n    *   **`t-norm operation`**: A t-norm (like MIN or PRODUCT) is the operation used to combine the membership values of the inputs in the multiple fuzzy sets that make up the rule's antecedent (e.g., IF `x1` is `A` **AND** `x2` is `B`). The value `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` is the *result* of this t-norm operation on the antecedent part. We do not need to perform this calculation, as the result is already provided.\n    *   **`Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set`**: This tells us the type of fuzzy system we are in. In a full IT3 Fuzzy Logic System, the rule activation level would be a Type-2 Fuzzy Set. However, the question simplifies this by providing a single, crisp number (`0.7`). In the context of the question, we must assume this single value represents the required activation level.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The question asks for the rule activation level. By definition, `Phi_k(x′)` represents this exact quantity. The information about the consequent set (`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`) is extraneous to the calculation of the rule activation level. Therefore, the rule activation level is directly given in the problem statement.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinguish Antecedent from Consequent:** The most critical point is to understand that rule activation is determined solely by the antecedent (\"IF\" part). Information related to the consequent (\"THEN\" part) is irrelevant for this specific calculation.\n2.  **Interpret Notation Correctly:** Recognizing that `Phi_k(x′)` is a standard symbol for the activation level or firing strength is key to solving the problem directly.\n3.  **Contextual Simplification:** Although an Interval Type-3 system is mentioned, the provided data (`0.7`) is a crisp number. You must work with the data given, which implies a simplified context where the activation level is represented by this single value.\n4.  **Role of the T-norm:** The t-norm is the *process* used to get the activation level, but the value `0.7` is the *result* of that process. You are given the result, not the inputs to the t-norm.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the analysis, the rule activation level is explicitly provided in the problem statement.\n\n*   The given input is `x'`.\n*   The rule is rule `k`.\n*   The notation for the activation level of rule `k` given input `x'` is `Phi_k(x′)`.\n*   The problem states that `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n*   The value `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` relates to the rule's output, not its activation.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
