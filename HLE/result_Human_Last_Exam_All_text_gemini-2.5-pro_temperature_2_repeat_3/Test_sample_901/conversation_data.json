    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The specified stereochemistry is crucial.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically bulky (hindered) base.\n    *   **Reaction:** A secondary alkyl halide reacting with a strong base undergoes an elimination reaction. Because the base is strong, the mechanism will be E2 (bimolecular elimination). The bulky nature of the t-butoxide anion strongly favors elimination over substitution (SN2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Substrate and its Conformations:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the hydrogen being removed (β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means they must both be in **axial** positions, on adjacent carbons, and trans to each other (a **trans-diaxial** arrangement).\n    *   Let's draw the chair conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S,2R) configuration means the bromo and methyl groups are *cis* to each other. In a 1,2-cis disubstituted cyclohexane, one substituent must be axial and the other equatorial.\n    *   We have two possible chair conformations that are in equilibrium:\n        *   **Conformation A:** Methyl group equatorial, Bromine axial. (e.g., Me is up-equatorial, Br is up-axial).\n        *   **Conformation B:** Methyl group axial, Bromine equatorial. (e.g., Me is up-axial, Br is up-equatorial).\n    *   The methyl group (CH₃) is sterically bulkier than the bromine atom (Br). Therefore, the conformation that places the larger methyl group in the more stable equatorial position (Conformation A) will be the major conformer present at equilibrium.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the E2 Reaction from the Major Conformer:**\n    *   The reaction will proceed primarily through the most stable and abundant conformer, which is **Conformation A (axial Br, equatorial CH₃)**.\n    *   In this conformation, the leaving group (Br) is in an **axial** position, which is necessary for the E2 reaction.\n    *   Now, we must identify available β-hydrogens that are anti-periplanar (i.e., axial and on the opposite face of the ring) to the axial bromine. The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   **At C2:** The methyl group is equatorial. This means the hydrogen on C2 is in the **axial** position. This hydrogen is trans-diaxial to the bromine on C1. So, elimination is possible here.\n        *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The **axial** hydrogen on C6 is also trans-diaxial to the bromine on C1. So, elimination is also possible here.\n\n4.  **Determine the Major Product (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   Since elimination can occur by removing a proton from either C2 or C6, two different alkene products are possible.\n        *   **Path 1 (Removing H from C2):** Forms a double bond between C1 and C2. The product is **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a trisubstituted alkene, which is the more thermodynamically stable product (the **Zaitsev product**).\n        *   **Path 2 (Removing H from C6):** Forms a double bond between C1 and C6. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a disubstituted alkene, which is the less thermodynamically stable product (the **Hofmann product**).\n    *   The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product depends on the base.\n    *   Potassium tert-butoxide is a **large, bulky base**. Due to its size, it has difficulty accessing sterically hindered protons. It will preferentially attack the most accessible (least sterically hindered) proton.\n    *   Comparing the accessibility of the two axial β-protons:\n        *   The axial proton on C2 is on a tertiary carbon and is adjacent to the equatorial methyl group. Its access is sterically hindered by the methyl group.\n        *   The axial proton on C6 is on a secondary carbon and is less sterically hindered.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky t-butoxide base will preferentially remove the proton from C6. This leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene.\n\n5.  **Final Product Identification:**\n    *   The reaction favors the Hofmann elimination pathway.\n    *   Elimination of H from C6 and Br from C1 results in a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the ring is numbered to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2), and then to give the substituent the lowest possible number. If the double bond is between the original C1 and C6, we number them as C1 and C2 (or vice-versa) so that the methyl group (on the original C2) gets the lowest number. This makes the methyl group located on carbon 3.\n    *   The name of the major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
