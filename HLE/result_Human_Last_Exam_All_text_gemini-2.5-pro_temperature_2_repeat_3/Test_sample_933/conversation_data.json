    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Compound and Process:** The question asks about the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄). The most common and direct method is the reaction between xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F₂).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Keyword \"Efficiently\":** In a chemical synthesis context, \"efficiently\" implies that the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate to produce a good yield of the desired product in a practical amount of time. It doesn't necessarily mean the absolute lowest temperature at which any product can be detected, but rather a practical, operational temperature.\n\n3.  **Consider Reaction Conditions for Xenon Fluorides:** The synthesis of different xenon fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆) from their elements is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions, specifically the temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants.\n    *   **To produce XeF₂:** A large excess of xenon is used, typically at around 400 °C.\n    *   **To produce XeF₄:** A molar ratio of Xe to F₂ of about 1:5 is used. The reaction is exothermic, and controlling the temperature is crucial.\n    *   **To produce XeF₆:** A large excess of fluorine (e.g., 1:20 ratio) and higher pressures and temperatures (e.g., 300°C at 60 atm) are used.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Specific Temperature for XeF₄ Synthesis:** The standard, well-documented procedure for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride involves heating the 1:5 mixture of xenon and fluorine in a sealed nickel container.\n    *   The literature and standard chemical texts state that the optimal temperature for this reaction is approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds readily to give a high yield of XeF₄.\n\n5.  **Assess the Given Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is excessively high. While the reaction would occur, such high temperatures can favor the formation of the higher fluoride, XeF₆, or lead to decomposition, making it less efficient for producing pure XeF₄.\n    *   **B. 400 °C:** This is the textbook temperature for the efficient and selective synthesis of XeF₄. The reaction rate and yield are optimal under these conditions.\n    *   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate between xenon and fluorine is very slow. It would take a very long time to produce a significant amount of XeF₄, so this process would not be considered \"efficient.\"\n    *   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to overcome the activation energy for the direct thermal reaction between Xe and F₂. The reaction would not proceed at any practical rate. While other methods like photochemical or electric discharge can work at lower temperatures, the direct thermal method is the most common for efficient bulk synthesis, and 400 °C is its characteristic temperature.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the coldest temperature at which XeF₄ can be produced *efficiently*. Based on the options provided, 400 °C is the established temperature for efficient synthesis. Temperatures below this are too slow, and temperatures above this are less optimal. Therefore, 400 °C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
