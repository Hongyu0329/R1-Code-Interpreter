    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial.**\n    Let $f(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$.\n    We try to find factors of this polynomial. We can look for common factors by grouping terms.\n    Notice that $x^2-2$ seems to be a common theme:\n    $x^7 - 2x^5 = x^5(x^2 - 2)$\n    $-9x^3 + 18x = -9x(x^2 - 2)$\n    $3x^2 - 6 = 3(x^2 - 2)$\n    Summing these up, we get:\n    $f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$.\n    So the roots of $f(x)$ are the roots of $h(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n    The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting field of $g(x)$ (let's call it $K_g$) and the splitting field of $h(x)$ (let's call it $K_h$).\n\n2.  **Determine the Galois groups of the factors.**\n    For $h(x) = x^2 - 2$, the roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The degree of this extension is $[K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n    The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (let's call it $C_2$).\n\n    For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n    - The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3.\n    - The coefficients -9 and 3 are divisible by 3. The other coefficients (0) are also divisible by 3.\n    - The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n    Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of $g(x)$ is 5.\n    The Galois group of $g(x)$, $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$. Since the polynomial is irreducible of degree 5, the order of the group is a multiple of 5, and by Cauchy's theorem, it contains an element of order 5 (which must be a 5-cycle in $S_5$).\n    To determine the Galois group further, we find the number of real roots of $g(x)$.\n    $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, so $x^4 = 9/5$. This gives two real critical points $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    Let $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    $g(x_0) = (\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 - 9(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5} ( (9/5) - 9) + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}(-36/5) + 3 < 0$.\n    $g(-x_0) = -(\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 + 9(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}(36/5) + 3 > 0$.\n    A positive local maximum and a negative local minimum imply that $g(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and therefore 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    Complex conjugation, when viewed as a permutation of the roots, acts as a transposition.\n    A subgroup of $S_5$ containing a 5-cycle and a transposition must be $S_5$ itself.\n    So, $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The order of this group is $|S_5| = 120$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois group of K.**\n    $K$ is the compositum $K_g K_h$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $K_g \\cap K_h \\neq \\mathbb{Q}$, then $K_h \\subseteq K_g$, meaning $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ would be a subfield of $K_g$.\n    The splitting field $K_g$ of an irreducible polynomial of degree 5 with Galois group $S_5$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the polynomial.\n    For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, the discriminant is $D = (-1)^{5(4)/2}(5^5 \\cdot 3^{5-1} + (-1)^{5-1}(5-1)^{5-1}(-9)^5) = 5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5 = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\n    The quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\n    For this to be the same field as $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we would need $-14863419 = 2k^2$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This is impossible, as the left side is negative and the right side is positive for any non-zero rational $k$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    So, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    This confirms that the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n    $G \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\n    The order of the group is $|G| = |S_5| \\cdot |C_2| = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$. So $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=240$.\n\n4.  **Find the degrees of normal subfields.**\n    We are looking for fields $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ and $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension.\n    By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these fields $L$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$.\n    The conditions on $L$ imply that $H$ must be a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$ (i.e., $H \\neq G$ and $H \\neq \\{e\\}$).\n    The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n    So, we need to find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ and compute their indices.\n\n5.  **List all normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$.**\n    The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n    The normal subgroups of $C_2$ (a cyclic group of order 2) are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n    The normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not limited to products of normal subgroups $N_1 \\times N_2$.\n    Let's analyze all possibilities based on Goursat's Lemma for normal subgroups. A normal subgroup $H$ of $S_5 \\times C_2$ is determined by normal subgroups $H_1, K_1$ of $S_5$ with $K_1 \\unlhd H_1$, normal subgroups $H_2, K_2$ of $C_2$ with $K_2 \\unlhd H_2$, and an isomorphism $\\phi: H_1/K_1 \\to H_2/K_2$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Product subgroups.** This corresponds to the case where the isomorphism $\\phi$ is between trivial groups $\\{e\\}$. This leads to $H = N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd S_5$ and $N_2 \\unlhd C_2$.\n        Excluding $H=\\{e\\}$ (index 240, field $K$) and $H=S_5 \\times C_2$ (index 1, field $\\mathbb{Q}$), we have:\n        a) $H = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=60$. Index $[G:H] = 240/60 = 4$.\n        b) $H = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=120$. Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n        c) $H = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H|=2$. Index $[G:H] = 240/2 = 120$.\n        d) $H = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H|=120$. Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: \"Diagonal\" subgroups.** These arise from non-trivial isomorphisms between quotient groups of normal subgroups. The only non-trivial quotient of normal subgroups of $S_5$ is $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. The only non-trivial quotient of normal subgroups of $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$.\n        Thus, there is one possibility for a diagonal subgroup, arising from an isomorphism $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to C_2$.\n        This normal subgroup is $H = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\phi(\\text{sgn}(g)) = c\\}$.\n        This subgroup consists of pairs $(g, e)$ for even permutations $g \\in A_5$ and pairs $(g, c)$ (where $c$ is the non-identity element of $C_2$) for odd permutations $g$. The number of elements in this subgroup is equal to the number of elements in $S_5$, so $|H|=120$.\n        The index is $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n6.  **List the possible degrees.**\n    From the analysis above, the indices of proper non-trivial normal subgroups are:\n    - From Case 1: 4, 2, 120. (Note that degree 2 appears twice from different subgroups).\n    - From Case 2: 2.\n    The set of all possible degrees for such field extensions $L$ is the set of these unique indices.\n    The possible values for $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ are $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Correctly factoring the polynomial is the crucial first step. A mistake here would change the entire problem.\n*   The determination of the Galois group $S_5$ relies on both irreducibility and the number of real roots. Both must be correctly established.\n*   Establishing that the Galois group of the compositum is a direct product requires proving the disjointness of the constituent fields. This involves the discriminant.\n*   The central part of the argument is to correctly identify all normal subgroups of the direct product group $S_5 \\times C_2$. One must remember that not all normal subgroups are direct products of the normal subgroups of the factors.\n*   The final answer is a list of possible degrees, which correspond to the indices of the normal subgroups. The number of subgroups with a given index does not matter, only the value of the index itself.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees for normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ is the set of indices we found: {2, 4, 120}."
