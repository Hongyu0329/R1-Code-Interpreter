    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the central pixel using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Initial Setup**\n\n*   **Define Start and End Points:**\n    *   Start point (x₁, y₁) = (1, 1)\n    *   End point (x₂, y₂) = (11, 5)\n\n*   **Calculate Deltas (dx and dy):**\n    *   `dx = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10`\n    *   `dy = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4`\n\n*   **Determine Driving Axis:**\n    *   Compare `dx` and `dy`. Since `dx (10) > dy (4)`, the x-axis is the \"driving axis.\" This means we will always increment `x` by 1 in each step and decide whether to increment `y`.\n\n*   **Calculate the Initial Decision Parameter (p₀):**\n    *   The formula for the initial decision parameter when `dx > dy` is `p = 2*dy - dx`.\n    *   `p₀ = 2 * 4 - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2`.\n\n**2. Algorithm Execution**\n\nWe will now iterate from `x = 1` to `x = 11`, generating the pixel at each step. We start with the point (1, 1) and `p = -2`.\n\n*   **Iteration 1:** Start at (1, 1)\n    *   `p = -2` which is `< 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot the next point by incrementing only `x`. The next pixel is (2, 1).\n    *   **Update `p`:** `p = p + 2*dy = -2 + (2*4) = -2 + 8 = 6`.\n\n*   **Iteration 2:** Current pixel is (2, 1)\n    *   `p = 6` which is `≥ 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot the next point by incrementing both `x` and `y`. The next pixel is (3, 2).\n    *   **Update `p`:** `p = p + 2*dy - 2*dx = 6 + (2*4) - (2*10) = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n\n*   **Iteration 3:** Current pixel is (3, 2)\n    *   `p = -6` which is `< 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot (4, 2).\n    *   **Update `p`:** `p = p + 2*dy = -6 + 8 = 2`.\n\n*   **Iteration 4:** Current pixel is (4, 2)\n    *   `p = 2` which is `≥ 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot (5, 3).\n    *   **Update `p`:** `p = p + 2*dy - 2*dx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n\n*   **Iteration 5:** Current pixel is (5, 3)\n    *   `p = -10` which is `< 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot (6, 3).\n    *   **Update `p`:** `p = p + 2*dy = -10 + 8 = -2`.\n\n*   **Iteration 6:** Current pixel is (6, 3)\n    *   `p = -2` which is `< 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot (7, 3).\n    *   **Update `p`:** `p = p + 2*dy = -2 + 8 = 6`.\n\n*   **Iteration 7:** Current pixel is (7, 3)\n    *   `p = 6` which is `≥ 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot (8, 4).\n    *   **Update `p`:** `p = p + 2*dy - 2*dx = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n\n*   **Iteration 8:** Current pixel is (8, 4)\n    *   `p = -6` which is `< 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot (9, 4).\n    *   **Update `p`:** `p = p + 2*dy = -6 + 8 = 2`.\n\n*   **Iteration 9:** Current pixel is (9, 4)\n    *   `p = 2` which is `≥ 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot (10, 5).\n    *   **Update `p`:** `p = p + 2*dy - 2*dx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n\n*   **Iteration 10:** Current pixel is (10, 5)\n    *   `p = -10` which is `< 0`.\n    *   **Action:** Plot (11, 5). This is the end point.\n\n**3. Identify the Central Pixel**\n\n*   **List of all pixels generated by the algorithm:**\n    (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), **(6, 3)**, (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n\n*   **Count the pixels:** There are a total of 11 pixels.\n\n*   **Find the center:** Since there is an odd number of pixels (11), there is a single central pixel. The position of the central pixel is `(11 + 1) / 2 = 6`.\n\n*   **Identify the 6th pixel in the list:** The 6th pixel in the generated sequence is (6, 3).\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Correctly identify the driving axis:** The logic of Bresenham's algorithm changes depending on whether `dx` or `dy` is larger. Here, `dx > dy`, so `x` is incremented in every step.\n2.  **Use the correct formulas:** The initial decision parameter `p₀` and the update rules for `p` depend on the driving axis. For `dx > dy`, `p₀ = 2*dy - dx`. The update rules are `p = p + 2*dy` (if p < 0) and `p = p + 2*dy - 2*dx` (if p >= 0).\n3.  **Count the pixels correctly:** The total number of pixels along the driving axis is `dx + 1`. In this case, `10 + 1 = 11`. This is crucial for finding the middle element.\n4.  **Indexing:** The first pixel is the starting point itself. When finding the Nth pixel, be sure to count from the beginning of the sequence.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
