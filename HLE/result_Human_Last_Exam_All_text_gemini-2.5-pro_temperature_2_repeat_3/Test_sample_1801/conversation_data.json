    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates.\n    *   **What:** Featured in a commercial.\n    *   **For Whom:** Enron.\n    *   **When:** 2000.\n    *   **Tagline:** \"Ask Why.\"\n    *   **Adjective:** \"infamous.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major corporate branding effort by Enron in 2000. The goal was to position Enron as an innovative, idea-driven company that was changing the world, rather than just an energy-trading firm. The campaign was created by the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather.\n\n3.  **Identify the Nobel Laureates:** Research into this specific advertising campaign reveals that two economists, both recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, were featured. Their names are Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n\n4.  **List Careful Points & Verify Details:**\n\n    *   **Infamy:** The commercial is considered \"infamous\" primarily due to the dramatic and fraudulent collapse of Enron just a year later in 2001. The campaign's message of intellectual integrity and challenging the status quo became profoundly ironic in light of the company's massive accounting scandal.\n    *   **Timing of the Nobel Prizes:** This is a crucial point of nuance.\n        *   **Myron Scholes** had already won his Nobel Prize when the commercial was made. He, along with Robert C. Merton, received the award in **1997** for his work on options pricing (the Black-Scholes model).\n        *   **Paul Krugman** was a highly respected and prominent economist in 2000, but he was not yet a Nobel laureate. He received his Nobel Prize in **2008** for his work on international trade theory.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Despite the fact that Krugman won his prize after the commercial aired, he is universally cited as one of the two Nobel laureates featured. The question refers to their status as \"Nobel laureates,\" which they both eventually held, cementing the historical narrative of the ad featuring these two specific economic thinkers.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Answer:** The two individuals featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial who are Nobel laureates are the economists Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman. Myron Scholes was a laureate at the time of the ad, while Paul Krugman would be awarded the prize several years later. The ad became infamous after Enron's spectacular collapse due to fraud.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial were Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
