    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to find a ballet step from the given list where the configuration of the legs at the end of the movement is the same as it was at the beginning. For steps starting and ending in fifth position, this means asking if the same foot is in front at the end as it was at the start.\n\n2.  **Analyze each option:**\n\n    *   **A. Entrechat six:** An \"entrechat\" is a jump where the legs beat against each other in the air. \"Six\" refers to six movements (three beats). An entrechat with an even number (like two, four, or six) that starts from and lands on two feet in fifth position will always land with the feet reversed. For example, if you start with the right foot in front, you will land with the left foot in front. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n    *   **B. Échappé battu changé:** \"Échappé\" is a step that moves from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second). \"Battu\" means it includes a beat. The key term here is **\"changé,\"** which literally means \"changed.\" This indicates that the feet will swap their front/back placement upon returning to fifth position. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n    *   **C. Assemblé:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble\" or \"join together.\" It's a jump from one foot, with the legs joining together in the air before landing on both feet in fifth position. There are many types of assemblé. Some, like *assemblé dessus* (over), change the feet. Others, like an *assemblé* that slides the front foot to the side and returns it to the front, do not. Because some common forms of assemblé do change the feet, this option is less certain than others unless specified as *sans changer* (without changing).\n\n    *   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" is a gliding step. \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\" In a *glissade derrière*, starting with the right foot front, the back (left) foot glides out to the side, and the right foot then closes *behind* the left one in fifth position. This action results in the left foot ending in front. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different. (Note: A *glissade devant*, closing to the front, would not change the feet).\n\n    *   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative jump, often described as a *pas de chat* with circles (*ronds de jambe*) from each leg. The dancer jumps from the back foot, which executes a *rond de jambe en l'air*. The front foot then does the same. The dancer lands on the first foot, and the second foot closes back into its original position. If you start with the right foot in front, you land with the right foot in front. Therefore, the starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the standard definitions of these steps, Entrechat six, Échappé battu changé, and Glissade derrière all result in a change of the feet's position. Assemblé is ambiguous, as it can be performed with or without a change. Gargouillade, however, is a step that, by its nature, returns the legs to their original starting configuration.\n\n<<<E>>>"
