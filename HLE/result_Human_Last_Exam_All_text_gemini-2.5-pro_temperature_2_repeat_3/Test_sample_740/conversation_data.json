    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation and its Kernel**\n    The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n    $u(x) = f(x) + \\lambda \\int_a^b K(x, y) u(y) dy$\n    Here, $f(x)=1$, $[a,b] = [0,1]$, and the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Kernel**\n    The kernel can be written as a finite geometric sum. Using the identity $a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\dots + b^{n-1})$, we get:\n    $K(x, y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + \\dots + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Kernel Type**\n    The kernel $K(x, y)$ is a sum of a finite number of terms, where each term is a product of a function of $x$ and a function of $y$. This is a **degenerate (or separable) kernel**.\n\n4.  **Reduce to a System of Linear Equations**\n    For a degenerate kernel, the integral equation can be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n    Substitute the simplified kernel into the equation:\n    $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k\\right) u(y) dy$\n    $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$.\n    The expression on the right-hand side is a polynomial in $x$ of degree at most $n-1$. This implies that the solution $u(x)$ must also be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. Let's express $u(x)$ using the standard monomial basis:\n    $u(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j x^j$.\n\n5.  **Derive the Linear System**\n    Substitute $u(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j x^j$ into the integral equation:\n    $\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j x^j = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j y^j\\right) dy$\n    $\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j x^j = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j \\int_0^1 y^{k+j} dy$\n    $\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j x^j = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\alpha_j}{k+j+1}$.\n    To compare coefficients, we re-index the sum over $x$ powers. Let $p = n-1-k$, so $k = n-1-p$.\n    $\\sum_{p=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_p x^p = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{p=0}^{n-1} x^p \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\alpha_j}{n-1-p+j+1}\\right)$\n    $\\sum_{p=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_p x^p = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{p=0}^{n-1} x^p \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\alpha_j}{n+j-p}\\right)$.\n    Equating the coefficients of powers of $x^p$ on both sides:\n    For $p=0$ (constant term): $\\alpha_0 = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\alpha_j}{n+j}$.\n    For $p=1, 2, \\dots, n-1$: $\\alpha_p = \\lambda \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\alpha_j}{n+j-p}$.\n    This can be written in matrix form $(I - \\lambda M)\\vec{\\alpha} = \\mathbf{e}_0$, where:\n    *   $\\vec{\\alpha} = [\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_{n-1}]^T$ is the vector of unknown coefficients.\n    *   $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n    *   $M$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $M_{pj} = \\frac{1}{n+j-p}$ (row index $p$, column index $j$).\n    *   $\\mathbf{e}_0 = [1, 0, \\dots, 0]^T$.\n\n6.  **Conditions for No Solution (Fredholm Alternative)**\n    The linear system $(I - \\lambda M)\\vec{\\alpha} = \\mathbf{e}_0$ has no unique solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, i.e., $\\det(I - \\lambda M) = 0$. This occurs when $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $M$. Let $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$ be such an eigenvalue. The corresponding values of $\\lambda$ are called the **characteristic values** of the integral equation.\n\n    According to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value, the non-homogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the right-hand side is orthogonal to all solutions of the corresponding homogeneous adjoint equation.\n\n    *   The kernel $K(x,y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$ is symmetric since $K(y,x) = \\frac{y^n - x^n}{y - x} = K(x,y)$. Therefore, the integral operator is self-adjoint.\n    *   The adjoint equation is the same as the homogeneous equation: $u_0(x) - \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x,y) u_0(y) dy = 0$. The solutions $u_0(x)$ are the eigenfunctions of the operator for the characteristic value $\\lambda$.\n    *   The condition for the existence of a solution is that the function $f(x)=1$ must be orthogonal to all eigenfunctions $u_0(x)$ corresponding to $\\lambda$. The orthogonality condition is: $\\int_0^1 f(x) u_0(x) dx = \\int_0^1 1 \\cdot u_0(x) dx = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the original equation has **no solution** if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value and for any associated eigenfunction $u_0(x)$, we have $\\int_0^1 u_0(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\n7.  **Checking the Orthogonality Condition**\n    An eigenfunction is of the form $u_0(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j x^j$, where $\\vec{\\alpha}$ is an eigenvector of $M$, i.e., $M\\vec{\\alpha} = \\mu \\vec{\\alpha}$ with $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$.\n    The condition becomes:\n    $\\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j x^j\\right) dx = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\alpha_j \\int_0^1 x^j dx = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\alpha_j}{j+1} \\neq 0$.\n    This condition is equivalent to $\\mathbf{b}^T \\vec{\\alpha} \\neq 0$, where $\\mathbf{b} = [1, 1/2, \\dots, 1/n]^T$.\n\n    While proving this for a general $n$ is advanced, analysis for small $n$ and known properties of related matrices (like the Hilbert matrix) suggest that this condition $\\mathbf{b}^T \\vec{\\alpha} \\neq 0$ holds for all eigenvectors of $M$.\n    *   For $n=1$, $M=[1]$. Eigenvalue $\\mu=1$, eigenvector $\\alpha_0=1$. Eigenfunction $u_0(x)=1$. $\\int_0^1 1 dx = 1 \\neq 0$. No solution for $\\lambda=1/\\mu=1$.\n    *   For $n=2$, $M=\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1/3 \\\\ 1 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\mu = 1/2 \\mp 1/\\sqrt{3}$. Eigenvectors are multiples of $[1, -\\sqrt{3}]^T$ and $[1, \\sqrt{3}]^T$. In both cases $\\mathbf{b}^T \\vec{\\alpha} = [1, 1/2] \\vec{\\alpha} \\neq 0$.\n\n    Assuming this holds generally, the equation has no solution if and only if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion**\n    The values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are the characteristic values of the integral operator. These are the values $\\lambda$ for which the homogeneous equation $u(x) - \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x,y) u(y) dy = 0$ has non-trivial solutions. These are precisely the values for which $\\det(I - \\lambda M) = 0$, where $M$ is the $n \\times n$ matrix defined in step 5.\n\nThe set of values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $M$ with elements $M_{pj} = \\frac{1}{n-p+j}$, for $p, j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$."
