    "An step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n\n1.  **Identify the integral and the nature of the integrand.**\n    The integral is given by $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$.\n    Let $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + g(x)}$.\n    We are interested in the behavior for small $\\epsilon > 0$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the integrand approaches $\\frac{1}{g(x)}$.\n    The function $g(x)$ has a root at $x=0$, since $g(0) = 0$.\n    Near $x=0$, the behavior of $g(x)$ is dominated by the term with the lowest power of $x$, which is $9x^5$.\n    The integral $\\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{g(x)} dx$ behaves like $\\int_0 \\frac{1}{9x^5} dx$ near $x=0$. This integral is divergent.\n    This indicates that for small $\\epsilon$, the value of the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ will be large and its behavior will be dominated by the contribution from a small region near $x=0$. This is a singular perturbation problem.\n\n2.  **Determine the leading order behavior.**\n    Since the dominant contribution comes from the region where $x$ is small, we can approximate the denominator by its most significant terms in that region: $\\epsilon + 9x^5$. Also, since the integrand becomes very small for large $x$, we can extend the upper limit of integration to $\\infty$ without introducing a significant error for the leading singular term. The error introduced will be a small constant.\n    So, the leading-order approximation is:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the leading order term.**\n    To evaluate this integral, we use a scaling transformation to factor out $\\epsilon$. Let $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u$.\n    Then $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$.\n    The integral becomes:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon + 9 ((\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u)^5} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon + 9 (\\epsilon/9) u^5} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon(1+u^5)}$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$.\n    The integral is a standard result given by $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$.\n    For $n=5$, we have $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n    So, the leading term is $A \\epsilon^{-4/5}$, where $A = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the next term in the approximation.**\n    A better approximation for $g(x)$ near $x=0$ is $9x^5 + 5x^6$. Let's find the correction due to the $5x^6$ term.\n    We can expand the integrand in powers of the smaller terms:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + \\dots} = \\frac{1}{(\\epsilon+9x^5) + (5x^6+\\dots)} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\epsilon+9x^5} - \\frac{5x^6}{(\\epsilon+9x^5)^2} + \\dots$.\n    The first term gives the leading behavior. The next term in the approximation of the integral comes from the second term of this expansion:\n    $I_2(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{-5x^6}{(\\epsilon+9x^5)^2} dx$.\n    Again, we use the scaling $x = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u$:\n    $I_2(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{-5 ((\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}u)^6}{(\\epsilon + 9 ((\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}u)^5)^2} (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}du = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{-5 (\\epsilon/9)^{6/5} u^6}{(\\epsilon(1+u^5))^2} (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}du$\n    $I_2(\\epsilon) = \\frac{-5 \\cdot (\\epsilon/9)^{7/5}}{\\epsilon^2} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^6}{(1+u^5)^2} du = -5 \\cdot 9^{-7/5} \\epsilon^{-3/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^6}{(1+u^5)^2} du$.\n    The integral can be calculated using integration by parts: $\\int u^2 \\frac{u^4}{(1+u^5)^2} du$. This yields $\\frac{2}{5}\\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{u}{1+u^5}du$.\n    The remaining integral is $\\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{u}{1+u^5}du = \\frac{1}{5}\\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{t^{-3/5}}{1+t}dt = \\frac{1}{5}\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)}$.\n    So, $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^6}{(1+u^5)^2} du = \\frac{2\\pi}{25 \\sin(2\\pi/5)}$.\n    The correction term is $B\\epsilon^{-3/5}$, where $B = -5 \\cdot 9^{-7/5} \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{25 \\sin(2\\pi/5)} = -\\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)}$.\n\n5.  **Formulate the final approximation.**\n    The asymptotic expansion of the integral for small $\\epsilon$ does not contain a constant term as the next dominant term after the leading one. Instead, it is a series of fractional powers of $\\epsilon$. The first two terms provide a good approximation.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx A \\epsilon^{-4/5} + B \\epsilon^{-3/5}$.\n    So the final analytical formula is:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$.\n    This formula captures the dominant singular behavior of the integral as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. The contribution from the upper limit of integration at $15.00$ and from higher order terms in $g(x)$ like $9x^8$ yield higher order terms in the expansion (e.g., $\\epsilon^{-1/5}$, constants, etc.) which are smaller than the two terms presented.\n\nFinal Answer is the derived formula.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-3/5}>>>"
