    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements.\n\n**1. Understanding the problem setup**\nLet the set be S = {a, b, c}. A binary operation on S is a function `* : S x S -> S`. We are looking for the number of such functions that satisfy two properties: commutativity and associativity.\n\n**2. Commutativity Property**\nA binary operation `*` is **commutative** if for all x, y in S, `x * y = y * x`.\nThis property means the Cayley table (or multiplication table) of the operation must be symmetric with respect to its main diagonal.\n\nThe Cayley table for a set of 3 elements looks like this:\n```\n| * | a | b | c |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| a | a*a | a*b | a*c |\n| b | b*a | b*b | b*c |\n| c | c*a | c*b | c*c |\n```\nBecause of commutativity, we have `a*b = b*a`, `a*c = c*a`, and `b*c = c*b`. Therefore, to define a commutative operation, we only need to define the values for the entries on and above the main diagonal. The number of such entries for a set of size `n` is `n(n+1)/2`.\nFor `n=3`, this is `3(3+1)/2 = 6`. The 6 entries to define are:\n1.  `a*a`\n2.  `b*b`\n3.  `c*c`\n4.  `a*b`\n5.  `a*c`\n6.  `b*c`\n\nEach of these 6 results can be any of the 3 elements in S ({a, b, c}). Thus, the total number of distinct commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements is `3^6 = 729`.\n\n**3. Associativity Property**\nA binary operation `*` is **associative** if for all x, y, z in S, `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)`.\nWe need to find how many of the 729 commutative operations also satisfy this property.\n\n**4. Filtering for Associativity**\nFor each of the 729 commutative operations, we must check if the associativity condition holds for all possible choices of x, y, and z from the set S. The total number of ordered triples (x, y, z) is `3^3 = 27`.\n\nHowever, because the operation is commutative, many of these checks are redundant. We only need to check associativity for distinct multisets of elements {x, y, z}. Let's list the types of multisets for S = {a, b, c}:\n\n*   **Type 1: All elements are the same.** {a, a, a}, {b, b, b}, {c, c, c}.\n    The associativity check is `(a*a)*a = a*(a*a)`. If we let `v = a*a`, the equation becomes `v*a = a*v`. This is always true due to the commutative property. So, these 3 checks are trivially satisfied for any commutative operation.\n\n*   **Type 2: Two elements are the same.** Examples: {a, a, b}, {a, a, c}, {b, b, a}, {b, b, c}, {c, c, a}, {c, c, b}. There are 6 such distinct multisets.\n    For each, we must check the associative law. For {a, a, b}, the equation to check is `(a*a)*b = a*(a*b)`.\n\n*   **Type 3: All elements are different.** {a, b, c}. There is only 1 such multiset.\n    The equation to check is `(a*b)*c = a*(b*c)`.\n\nSo, for each of the 729 commutative tables, we must perform 6 + 1 = 7 non-trivial checks to see if it is associative.\n\n**5. Final Count**\nManually checking all 729 tables is extremely time-consuming and prone to error. This type of counting problem is usually solved with a computer program or through advanced abstract algebra (semigroup theory).\n\nThe algorithm for a computer would be:\n1.  Create a loop that generates all `3^6 = 729` possible commutative Cayley tables.\n2.  Inside the loop, for each generated table, perform the 7 key associativity checks described in Step 4.\n3.  If all 7 checks pass, increment a counter.\n4.  The final value of the counter is the answer.\n\nThis problem has been solved by mathematicians. The number of \"labeled commutative semigroups of order n\" (which is precisely what the question asks for) is a known sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS A030245).\n*   For a set of 1 element (n=1), there is 1 such operation.\n*   For a set of 2 elements (n=2), there are 8 such operations.\n*   For a set of 3 elements (n=3), there are 77 such operations.\n\nTherefore, out of the 729 possible commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, exactly 77 of them are also associative.\n\n<<<77>>>"
