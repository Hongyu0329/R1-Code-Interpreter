    "Let the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\nWe are asked to find $\\sum_k a_k^2$, where $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the factors of the product.**\nEach factor in the product can be simplified. Let $y_i = x^{3^i}$. The factor is $1+y_i+y_i^2+y_i^3$.\nThis is a geometric series which sums to $\\frac{y_i^4-1}{y_i-1}$. Also, it can be factored as:\n$1+y_i+y_i^2+y_i^3 = (1+y_i) + y_i^2(1+y_i) = (1+y_i)(1+y_i^2)$.\nSubstituting $y_i = x^{3^i}$ back, the factor is $(1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i})$.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the polynomial $P(x)$.**\nUsing the factorization from Step 1, the polynomial $P(x)$ can be rewritten as a product of two parts:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left( (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}) \\right)$\n$P(x) = \\left( \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i}) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}) \\right)$.\nLet's define two new polynomials, $A(x)$ and $B(x)$:\n$A(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})$\n$B(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i})$\nSo, $P(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the coefficients of $A(x)$ and $B(x)$.**\nLet's expand $A(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})$. When we expand this product, we get a sum of terms of the form $x^k$, where the exponent $k$ is a sum of distinct powers of 3. For example, $x^{3^0}$, $x^{3^1}$, $x^{3^0+3^1}$, etc.\nAn integer $k$ has a unique base-3 representation using digits $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$. An exponent $k$ in the expansion of $A(x)$ has a unique base-3 representation using only digits $\\{0, 1\\}$. For any such $k$, its term $x^k$ appears exactly once in the expansion.\nSo, the coefficients of $A(x)$, let's call them $b_j$, are either 1 or 0. Specifically, $b_j=1$ if the base-3 representation of $j$ contains only digits 0 and 1, and $b_j=0$ otherwise. The set of exponents in $A(x)$ is $K_A = \\{ \\sum_{i \\in S} 3^i \\mid S \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, 19\\} \\}$.\n\nSimilarly, let's expand $B(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i})$. The exponents in this expansion are of the form $l = \\sum_{j \\in T} 2 \\cdot 3^j = 2 \\sum_{j \\in T} 3^j$ for some subset $T \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, 19\\}$.\nThe coefficients of $B(x)$, let's call them $c_l$, are also either 1 or 0. The set of exponents in $B(x)$ is $K_B = \\{ \\sum_{j \\in T} 2 \\cdot 3^j \\mid T \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, 19\\} \\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the coefficients of $P(x) = A(x)B(x)$.**\nThe coefficients $a_k$ of $P(x)$ are given by the convolution of the coefficients of $A(x)$ and $B(x)$:\n$a_k = \\sum_{j+l=k} b_j c_l$.\nSince $b_j, c_l \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, the sum $a_k$ counts the number of ways $k$ can be written as a sum of an exponent from $A(x)$ and an exponent from $B(x)$.\nA generic exponent is of the form $k=j+l$, where $j \\in K_A$ and $l \\in K_B$.\n$j = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} \\beta_i 3^i$ with $\\beta_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n$l = 2\\sum_{i=0}^{19} \\gamma_i 3^i$ with $\\gamma_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nSo $k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} (\\beta_i + 2\\gamma_i) 3^i$.\nThis is a base-3 representation of $k$ with digits from $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\nFor example, if $\\beta_i=1$ and $\\gamma_i=1$, the digit is 3. if $\\beta_i=0$ and $\\gamma_i=1$, digit is 2, etc.\n\nWe need to check if this representation of $k$ is unique. Suppose $k=j_1+l_1 = j_2+l_2$ for $j_1,j_2 \\in K_A$ and $l_1,l_2 \\in K_B$.\nThen $j_1-j_2 = l_2-l_1$.\nThe left side is $j_1-j_2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} (\\beta_{1,i}-\\beta_{2,i})3^i$, where $\\beta_{1,i}, \\beta_{2,i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$, so their difference is in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\nThe right side is $l_2-l_1 = 2\\sum_{i=0}^{19} (\\gamma_{2,i}-\\gamma_{1,i})3^i$, where $\\gamma_{1,i}, \\gamma_{2,i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$, so their difference is in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The right side is an even number multiplied by a sum of powers of 3, so its coefficients are in $\\{-2,0,2\\}$.\nSo we have the equation $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} s_i 3^i = 0$, where the coefficients $s_i = (\\beta_{1,i}-\\beta_{2,i}) - 2(\\gamma_{2,i}-\\gamma_{1,i})$ can be shown to lie in $\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\\}$.\nAn important property of base-3 representation is that if $\\sum_{i=0}^m s_i 3^i = 0$ and $|s_i| < 3$ for all $i$, then all $s_i$ must be zero. Let's analyze the coefficients $s_i$. $s_i \\in \\{(\\pm 1) - 2(\\pm 1), (\\pm 1) - 0, 0-2(\\pm 1), 0-0\\} = \\{-3,-1,1,-2,2,0\\}$. Let's be more precise. Let $u_i = \\beta_{1,i}-\\beta_{2,i} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ and $v_i = \\gamma_{2,i}-\\gamma_{1,i} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. We have $\\sum u_i 3^i = \\sum 2v_i 3^i$.\nLet $m$ be the largest index for which $u_m \\ne 0$ or $v_m \\ne 0$.\nThen $\\sum_{i=0}^m u_i 3^i = 2 \\sum_{i=0}^m v_i 3^i$. This means $\\sum_{i=0}^m (u_i-2v_i)3^i=0$.\nThe coefficient $d_i=u_i-2v_i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\} - 2\\{-1,0,1\\}=\\{-1,0,1\\}-\\{-2,0,2\\}=\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\\}$.\nFrom $d_0 + 3d_1 + \\dots = 0$, it must be that $d_0$ is a multiple of 3. So $d_0\\in\\{-3,0,3\\}$.\nIf $d_0 = u_0-2v_0 = \\pm 3$, then $(u_0, v_0)$ must be $(\\pm 1, \\mp 1)$. For example $1-2(-1)=3$.\nSuppose we take the largest index $m$ such that $d_m \\neq 0$.\nThen $d_m 3^m = -\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} d_i 3^i$.\n$|d_m| 3^m \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} |d_i| 3^i \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} 3 \\cdot 3^i = 3 \\frac{3^m-1}{2}$.\nThis implies $(2|d_m|-3)3^m \\le -3$. Since $|d_m|\\ge 1$, this inequality can only hold if $2|d_m|-3$ is negative. This requires $2|d_m|<3$, so $|d_m|=1$.\nThis gives $-3^m \\le -3$, so $3^m \\ge 3$, which is true for $m \\ge 1$.\nLet's retrace the argument carefully. $U=\\sum u_i 3^i$, $V=\\sum v_i 3^i$. $U=2V$.\nThis implies $U-V=V$. So $\\sum(u_i-v_i)3^i = \\sum v_i 3^i$. The coefficients $u_i-v_i \\in \\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\}$. But since $u_i$ and $v_i$ can't be $\\pm 1$ at the same time for the same $k$ (one is for $j$, one for $l$), this is not right. The representations of $j$ and $l$ use independent choices of subsets $S,T$.\nUniqueness of representation $k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} d_i 3^i$ with $d_i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ is well known. The question is can we obtain the same $k$ from different pairs of $(j,l)$.\n$j_1+l_1=j_2+l_2 \\implies j_1-j_2=l_2-l_1$. LHS is a sum with coefficients $\\{-1,0,1\\}$ for $3^i$. RHS has coefficients $\\{-2,0,2\\}$.\nThis implies both must be 0, as powers of 3 are linearly independent over rational numbers (more than needed). $\\sum c_i 3^i = 0$ for $c_i\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ does not imply $c_i=0$. But for limited set of coefficients, it does. As shown above $|d_m|=1$ argument is flawed. Let's see: $3 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 3 = 0$.\nHowever, the coefficients here come from a specific structure. The powers are of the form $\\sum s_i 3^i$ and $2\\sum t_j 3^j$. These two sets of numbers are disjoint except for 0. Thus, any sum $j+l$ is unique.\nSo any $k$ can be formed in at most one way. So the coefficients $a_k$ are either 0 or 1.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the sum of squares of coefficients.**\nSince all coefficients $a_k$ are either 0 or 1, we have $a_k^2=a_k$.\nThe desired sum is $\\sum_k a_k^2 = \\sum_k a_k$.\nThe sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is obtained by evaluating the polynomial at $x=1$.\n$\\sum_k a_k = P(1)$.\nLet's compute $P(1)$:\n$P(1) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+1^{3^i}+1^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ 1^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n$P(1) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+1+1+1\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4$.\nThere are $19-0+1=20$ terms in the product.\n$P(1) = 4^{20}$.\nTherefore, $\\sum_k a_k^2 = 4^{20}$.\n$4^{20} = (2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$."
