    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage of irreducible objects in the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ representations, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the mathematical objects and the question**\n\n*   **Quantum Group:** We are considering the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, also commonly denoted as $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. It's an algebra depending on a parameter $q$.\n*   **Root of Unity:** The parameter $q$ is a primitive third root of unity, e.g., $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$. The representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity is known to be non-semisimple, meaning that there exist indecomposable representations that are not irreducible.\n*   **Category C:** This is the category whose objects are all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the percentage of objects in $C$ that are irreducible. An irreducible representation is always indecomposable. The question asks for the ratio of the number of irreducible representations to the number of all indecomposable representations.\n\n**Step 2: Address the ambiguity in the definition of the category C**\n\nA careful point is that the full category of finite-dimensional representations of $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is vast and complex. It contains continuous families of representations, making a simple count or percentage calculation ill-defined. For example, there's a two-parameter family of 3-dimensional irreducible representations. Concurrently, there are specific \"blocks\" of representations where one finds an infinite number of discrete indecomposable representations but only a finite number of irreducible ones.\n\nTo make the question precise, one must restrict to a suitable, well-behaved, discrete subcategory. The most natural and commonly studied such category in this context is the **category of tilting modules**. It is a standard assumption in such problems that this is the intended category of interest. We will proceed under this well-justified assumption.\n\nLet $C$ be the category of finite-dimensional tilting modules for $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. All objects in this category are, by construction, indecomposable.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the indecomposable tilting modules**\n\nThe classification of indecomposable tilting modules for $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at a root of unity is a known result in representation theory.\n\n*   **Parameter $\\ell$:** The representation theory at a root of unity $q$ is governed by a parameter $\\ell$, which is the order of $q^2$. Since $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$, we have $q^2 = e^{4\\pi i/3}$. The order of $q^2$ is 3. So, $\\ell=3$.\n*   **Classification:** The indecomposable tilting modules are parametrized by a positive integer $n \\geq 1$ (which corresponds to the dimension) and a sign $\\epsilon \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$. Let's denote an indecomposable tilting module by $T_n^\\epsilon$.\n*   **List of Objects:** The set of isomorphism classes of objects in our category $C$ is $\\{T_n^\\epsilon \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}, \\epsilon \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}\\}$. This is a countably infinite set.\n\n**Step 4: Identify which of the indecomposable tilting modules are irreducible**\n\nA key theorem provides a simple condition for the irreducibility of a tilting module.\n\n*   **Irreducibility Condition:** The indecomposable tilting module $T_n^\\epsilon$ is irreducible if and only if its dimension $n$ is not divisible by the parameter $\\ell=3$.\n*   **List of Irreducible Objects:** The set of irreducible objects in $C$ is $\\{T_n^\\epsilon \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}, 3 \\nmid n, \\epsilon \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the percentage**\n\nSince both the set of indecomposable modules and the set of irreducible modules are infinite, we calculate the percentage as the natural density of the irreducible ones within the set of all indecomposable ones. We can find this by taking the limit of the ratio of their counts up to a given dimension $N$.\n\n*   Let $Ind(N)$ be the number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable tilting modules with dimension at most $N$.\n    $Ind(N) = |\\{ (n,\\epsilon) \\mid 1 \\le n \\le N, \\epsilon \\in \\{\\pm 1\\} \\}| = 2 \\times N = 2N$.\n\n*   Let $Irr(N)$ be the number of isomorphism classes of irreducible tilting modules with dimension at most $N$.\n    $Irr(N) = |\\{ (n,\\epsilon) \\mid 1 \\le n \\le N, 3 \\nmid n, \\epsilon \\in \\{\\pm 1\\} \\}|$.\n    This is twice the number of integers from 1 to $N$ that are not divisible by 3.\n    The number of integers from 1 to $N$ that are divisible by 3 is $\\lfloor N/3 \\rfloor$.\n    So, the number of integers from 1 to $N$ not divisible by 3 is $N - \\lfloor N/3 \\rfloor$.\n    Therefore, $Irr(N) = 2(N - \\lfloor N/3 \\rfloor)$.\n\n*   The desired percentage is the limit of the ratio as $N \\to \\infty$:\n    Percentage $= \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{Irr(N)}{Ind(N)} \\times 100\\%$\n    Percentage $= \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{2(N - \\lfloor N/3 \\rfloor)}{2N} \\times 100\\%$\n    Percentage $= \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lfloor N/3 \\rfloor}{N}\\right) \\times 100\\%$\n\n*   As $N \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{\\lfloor N/3 \\rfloor}{N}$ approaches $1/3$. So, the limit is:\n    Percentage $= \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times 100\\% = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 100\\%$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe percentage is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 100\\%$, which is approximately $66.67\\%$.\n\n<<<66.67>>>"
