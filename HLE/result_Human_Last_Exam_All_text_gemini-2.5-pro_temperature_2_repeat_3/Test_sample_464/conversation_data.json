    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Premise**\n\n*   **Function Class:** We are given a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that belongs to the Schwartz space, denoted $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$. A function is in the Schwartz space if it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and it, along with all its derivatives, decays faster than any inverse power of $|x|$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. Formally, for all non-negative integers $\\alpha, \\beta$, $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |x^\\alpha f^{(\\beta)}(x)| < \\infty$.\n*   **Condition:** The moments of the function $f$ are all zero. The $k$-th moment is given by $m_k = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx$. The problem states that $m_k = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**2. List the Careful Points**\n\n*   **The set $\\mathbb{N}$:** The symbol $\\mathbb{N}$ can mean either $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$ or $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. We should consider both cases. Standard problems of this type usually assume all non-negative integer moments are zero ($k \\ge 0$). We will see that the result holds in either case due to the strong properties of Schwartz functions.\n*   **Analyticity vs. Smoothness:** A function can be infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) without being analytic. The classic counterexample is $g(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x \\neq 0$ and $g(0) = 0$. All derivatives of $g$ at $x=0$ are zero, but the function is not identically zero. A key part of the proof will be to establish that the Fourier transform of our function $f$ is analytic on the real line.\n*   **Tool of Choice:** The Fourier transform is exceptionally well-suited for problems involving Schwartz functions. The key properties are that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism on $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ and that it elegantly relates moments of a function to derivatives of its transform.\n\n**3. The Core Argument using Fourier Transforms**\n\n*   **Step A: Introduce the Fourier Transform.**\n    Let $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\n    A fundamental property of the Fourier transform is that if $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, then its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also in $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n*   **Step B: Relate Moments of $f$ to Derivatives of $\\hat{f}$.**\n    We can differentiate $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ with respect to $\\xi$ under the integral sign because of the rapid decay of $f$. The $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}$ is:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\n    Evaluating at $\\xi=0$, we get a direct relationship between the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin and the moments of $f$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\n\n*   **Step C: Apply the Given Condition.**\n    The problem states $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: $\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.**\n        In this case, the condition immediately implies that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.**\n        The condition implies $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 1$. This leaves $\\hat{f}^{(0)}(0) = \\hat{f}(0)$ undetermined for now.\n\n*   **Step D: Prove $\\hat{f}$ is Zero using Analyticity.**\n    A crucial part of the argument is to show that since all derivatives (or all derivatives from the first onward) are zero at a point, the function itself must be zero. This requires showing that $\\hat{f}$ is a real analytic function. A function $g$ is real analytic if its Taylor series converges to the function in a neighborhood of every point.\n\n    Let's use Taylor's theorem with remainder for $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi=0$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(j)}(0)}{j!} \\xi^j + R_n(\\xi) $$\n    where the remainder term $R_n(\\xi)$ can be bounded. We have shown that $\\hat{f}^{(j)}(0)=0$ for $j \\ge 1$.\n    Therefore, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(0) + R_n(\\xi)$ for $n \\ge 1$. To show $\\hat{f}$ is constant, we must show $R_n(\\xi) \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\n    The remainder can be bounded by:\n    $$ |R_n(\\xi)| \\le \\frac{|\\xi|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \\sup_{t \\in [0, \\xi]} |\\hat{f}^{(n+1)}(t)| $$\n    Since $\\hat{f} \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, so are all its derivatives. Therefore, $\\sup_t |\\hat{f}^{(n+1)}(t)|$ is finite. Moreover, using the continuity of the Fourier transform on the space $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, one can show that the norms of $\\hat{f}^{(n)}$ grow at most polynomially with $n$. Let's say $\\sup_t |\\hat{f}^{(n+1)}(t)| \\le P(n+1)$ for some polynomial $P$.\n    Then, $|R_n(\\xi)| \\le \\frac{|\\xi|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} P(n+1)$.\n    For any fixed $\\xi$, this expression tends to 0 as $n \\to \\infty$ because the factorial growth of $(n+1)!$ dominates the polynomial growth of $P(n+1)$ and the exponential growth of $|\\xi|^{n+1}$.\n\n    This proves that the remainder $R_n(\\xi) \\to 0$. Therefore, the Taylor series of $\\hat{f}$ around 0 converges to $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k $$\n\n    *   Now, back to our two cases for $\\mathbb{N}$:\n        *   **Case 1 ($\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$):** $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)=0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. The Taylor series is identically zero, so $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$.\n        *   **Case 2 ($\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$):** $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)=0$ for all $k \\ge 1$. The Taylor series becomes $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(0)$. This means $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be a constant function. However, we know $\\hat{f} \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, which requires $\\lim_{|\\xi|\\to\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$. The only constant function with this property is the zero function. Thus, it must be that $\\hat{f}(0)=0$, and consequently $\\hat{f}(\\xi)=0$ for all $\\xi$.\n\n    In both interpretations of $\\mathbb{N}$, we reach the same conclusion: $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is identically zero.\n\n*   **Step E: Conclude that $f$ is Zero.**\n    The Fourier transform is an isomorphism on $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, which means it is invertible and, in particular, injective (one-to-one). The only function whose Fourier transform is the zero function is the zero function itself. This can also be seen from the inverse Fourier transform formula:\n    $$ f(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = 0 $$\n    Therefore, $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nYes, it does follow that $f=0$. The conditions that $f$ is a Schwartz function and that all its moments are zero are very restrictive. They force the Fourier transform of $f$ to have all its derivatives at the origin equal to zero. The properties of the Fourier transform on Schwartz space are strong enough to guarantee that the Fourier transform is analytic, which in turn means it must be the zero function. By the injectivity of the Fourier transform, $f$ itself must be the zero function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
