    "This problem requires finding the steady-state probabilities of a continuous-time Markov chain and then summing two of them. The system is described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the system of equations and identify the model.**\nThe given system is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t) \\\\\nP_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) \\\\\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t) \\\\\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) \\\\\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nThis set of equations describes the time evolution of the probabilities of being in one of four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The question asks for $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which is the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1.\n\n**Step 2: Check for consistency and correct the model.**\nA critical point in such systems is that the sum of all probabilities must remain constant at 1. This implies that the sum of their time derivatives must be zero: $\\frac{d}{dt}\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = 0$.\nLet's sum the given equations:\n$$\n\\sum P_i'(t) = P_{0}(-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01}) + P_{1}(\\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{12} + \\lambda_{12}) + P_{2}(\\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{23} + \\lambda_{23}) + P_{3}(\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31}) \\\\\n\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)\n$$\nSince $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019 \\neq 0$, the sum of derivatives is not zero, which contradicts the condition that $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$. This indicates a typo in the problem statement.\nIn the standard Kolmogorov equations, a transition from state $i$ to state $j$ (rate $\\lambda_{ij}$) results in a positive term $+\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ in the equation for $P_j'(t)$. The term for transition from state 0 to state 1 should be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ in the equation for $P_1'(t)$. The provided equation has $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. We correct this to proceed.\nThe corrected equation for $P_1'(t)$ is:\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nWith this correction, the sum of derivatives becomes zero, and the system is consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the steady-state equations.**\nIn the steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities become constant, let's denote them by $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. This means all derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero. The system of differential equations transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n4.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$ (Normalization equation)\nNote: We only need three of the first four derivative equations as they are linearly dependent. We choose the simpler ones.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system of equations.**\nWe will express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\nFrom equation (1):\n$\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 = \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}\\pi_1$\nFrom equation (2):\n$(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}}\\pi_1$\nFrom equation (3):\n$\\lambda_{31}\\pi_3 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}}\\pi_2$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the given numerical values.**\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\nLet's compute the coefficients for the relationships between the probabilities:\n-   $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1$\n-   $\\pi_2 = \\frac{0.4}{0.392 + 0.008}\\pi_1 = \\frac{0.4}{0.4}\\pi_1 = \\pi_1$\n-   $\\pi_3 = \\frac{0.008}{0.008}\\pi_2 = \\pi_2$. Since $\\pi_2=\\pi_1$, we get $\\pi_3=\\pi_1$.\n\n**Step 6: Use the normalization equation to find the value of each probability.**\nSubstitute these relationships into the normalization equation (4):\n$$\n\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1 \\\\\n(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3)\\pi_1 = 1\n$$\nSolving for $\\pi_1$:\n$$\n\\pi_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} \\right) = 1 \\\\\n\\pi_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} \\right) = 1 \\\\\n\\pi_1 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1 \\\\\n\\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}\n$$\nNow, we find $\\pi_0$:\n$$\n\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}\n$$\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n$$\n\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}\n$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$\n\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768\n$$"
