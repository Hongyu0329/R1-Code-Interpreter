    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the specific verses in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem and Section:** The question refers to the didactic poem `Aqeedat al-'Awaam` (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. This poem systematically covers the essential tenets of Islamic faith. We need to find the specific section dedicated to the Prophets (Anbiya').\n\n2.  **Locate the Introduction to the Prophets:** The poem discusses the attributes of Allah first, and then moves on to the topic of His messengers. The section on the attributes of the Prophets (such as truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence) begins around bayt (verse) 26.\n\n3.  **Find the Start of the List of Names:** After establishing the necessary attributes of the Prophets, the author begins to list the 25 prophets whose names it is generally considered obligatory for a Muslim to know. The enumeration begins with the first prophet, Adam (peace be upon him).\n    *   The specific verse that starts the list is **bayt 30**:\n        > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ ... صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        > (They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed.)\n\n4.  **Follow the List to its Conclusion:** The poem continues to list the names of the prophets over the next few verses.\n    *   **Bayt 31:** Mentions Lot, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 32:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** This verse completes the list with Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and finally the last Prophet, Muhammad ﷺ (referred to as Taha).\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        > (Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [Muhammad], the Seal, leave misguidance.)\n        The word `خَاتِمٌ` (Khatim/Seal) signifies that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the last in the list and the last of all prophets, marking the end of the enumeration.\n\n5.  **Confirm the End Point:** To be certain the list ends at bayt 33, we examine the next verse.\n    *   **Bayt 34:** This verse is a prayer and salutation upon all the prophets mentioned:\n        > عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ ... وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n        > (Upon them be prayers and peace, and upon their families, for as long as the days last.)\n    This confirms that the enumeration of names was concluded in the previous verse, bayt 33.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** The numbering of the verses can sometimes vary slightly (by one or two verses) between different printed editions. However, the standard and most widely accepted numbering places the start of the list at bayt 30 and the end at bayt 33.\n*   **The Name \"Taha\":** The poem uses \"Taha\" (طه), one of the names/titles of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, to refer to him.\n*   **Scope:** The verses list the 25 prophets whose names are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. This specific list is what is being asked about.\n*   **Context:** It is important to distinguish the verses listing the names from the verses discussing the general concept and attributes of prophethood which precede them.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the list of the names of the Prophets in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' begins at **bayt 30** and concludes at **bayt 33**.\n\n<<<From bayt 30 to bayt 33>>>"
