    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of \"Sir Launfal\":** The poem \"Sir Launfal,\" a 14th-century Middle English romance attributed to Thomas Chestre, survives in a single medieval manuscript. The contents of this specific manuscript are key to answering the question.\n\n2.  **Name the Manuscript:** The manuscript in question is known as **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**. It is a miscellany, which is a collection of various texts bound together in one volume. It is currently held in the British Library.\n\n3.  **Examine the Manuscript's Contents:** To find the book of manners, we must look at the other works included in Cotton MS Caligula A.ii alongside \"Sir Launfal.\" This manuscript contains several other important Middle English romances, such as *Libeaus Desconus* and *The Erl of Tolous*.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** Among the collection of romances and other texts within the manuscript, there is one particular work that fits the description of a \"book of manners\" or a \"courtesy book.\" This genre of literature was designed to teach etiquette, social graces, and moral conduct, especially to children and young people serving in noble households.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Specific Text:** The book of manners found in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is titled ***The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke*** (The Little Children's Little Book). This short instructional poem provides clear advice on topics like table manners, polite conversation, and proper behavior in the presence of one's lord.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Uniqueness of the Manuscript:** The answer is definitive because \"Sir Launfal\" exists in only this one manuscript. Therefore, the phrase \"preserved alongside\" refers specifically to the other texts in the Cotton Caligula A.ii collection.\n*   **Genre Identification:** It's important to correctly identify *The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke* as a \"book of manners\" (or courtesy book), distinguishing it from the romances and other works in the manuscript.\n*   **Spelling:** Medieval text titles have variant spellings. \"The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke\" is a common modernization, but other versions like \"The Lytille Childrenis Lytil Boke\" also exist.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the book of manners preserved in the same manuscript (Cotton MS Caligula A.ii) as \"Sir Launfal\" is *The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke*.\n\n<<<The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke>>>"
