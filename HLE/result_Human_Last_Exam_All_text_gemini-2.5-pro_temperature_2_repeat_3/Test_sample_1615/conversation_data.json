    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are asked to find the maximum possible value for the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  The number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\n2.  The graph $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n\nThe chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of a specific graph $G$. The question asks for the maximum possible value that $\\chi(G)$ can take across all graphs $G$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet this maximum value be $C_{max}$. We need to find:\n$C_{max} = \\max \\{ \\chi(G) \\mid |V(G)|=12345 \\text{ and } G \\neq K_{12345} \\}$\n\n**Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\nFor any simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n\nA key theorem in graph theory states that the equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph, $K_n$.\n*   **Why?** If $G = K_n$, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, so all $n$ vertices must receive a distinct color. Thus, $\\chi(K_n) = n$. Conversely, if a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices requires $n$ colors, it means no two vertices can share the same color. This can only happen if every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, which is the definition of a complete graph, $K_n$.\n\nIn this problem, we are explicitly told that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph.\nSince $G \\neq K_n$, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$.\n$\\chi(G) < n$\n\nGiven $n = 12345$, this means:\n$\\chi(G) < 12345$\nSince the chromatic number must be an integer, the highest possible value it can take is $12344$.\nSo, we have established an upper bound: $C_{max} \\le 12344$.\n\n**Step 3: Proving the Upper Bound is Achievable**\nTo show that 12344 is the maximum possible value, we must demonstrate that there exists at least one graph $G^*$ that satisfies the given conditions and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344.\n\nLet's construct such a graph, $G^*$. A good candidate is a graph that is very close to being a complete graph.\nConsider the graph formed by taking the complete graph on $n=12345$ vertices, $K_{12345}$, and removing a single edge. Let's call this graph $G^* = K_{12345} - e$.\n*   $G^*$ has 12345 vertices.\n*   $G^*$ is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$ because it is missing an edge.\n*   Thus, $G^*$ is a valid graph according to the problem statement.\n\nNow, let's determine the chromatic number of $G^*$, $\\chi(G^*)$.\nWe can determine $\\chi(G^*)$ by finding a lower bound and an upper bound for it.\n*   **Lower Bound:** The chromatic number of any graph is at least the size of its largest clique (a subgraph that is complete), denoted by $\\omega(G)$. Let the edge removed from $K_{12345}$ to form $G^*$ be $e=(u,v)$. Now consider the set of vertices $V' = V(G^*) \\setminus \\{u\\}$. This set has $n-1 = 12344$ vertices. In the original $K_{12345}$, all vertices in $V'$ were connected to each other, forming a clique of size $n-1$. Since the removed edge $(u,v)$ had a vertex $u$ which is not in $V'$, no edges within $V'$ were removed. Therefore, the subgraph induced by $V'$ in $G^*$ is still a complete graph, a clique of size $n-1=12344$. Since $G^*$ contains a clique of size 12344, we need at least 12344 colors to color it. So, $\\chi(G^*) \\ge 12344$.\n\n*   **Upper Bound:** From Step 2, we know that for any graph on $n$ vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number is at most $n-1$. Since $G^*$ is not complete, we have $\\chi(G^*) \\le n-1 = 12344$.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we have:\n$12344 \\le \\chi(G^*) \\le 12344$\nThis implies that $\\chi(G^*) = 12344$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nWe have shown two things:\n1.  For any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph, the number of colors needed for a proper coloring is at most 12344.\n2.  There exists at least one such graph (namely, $K_{12345}$ with one edge removed) that requires exactly 12344 colors.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors that we might need is 12344.\n\nThe reference to the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ in the problem is consistent with this result. For the graph $G^* = K_{12345} - e$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G^*) = 12344$. Brooks' theorem states that for a connected graph that is not complete or an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. Our constructed graph $G^*$ is a case where $\\chi(G^*) = \\Delta(G^*) = 12344$."
