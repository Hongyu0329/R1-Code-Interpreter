    "This problem asks for the evaluation of an inner product, $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, that appears in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature. We will use the imaginary-time (Matsubara) formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Partition Function and the Euclidean Action**\n\nIn finite-temperature field theory, physical quantities are derived from the partition function, Z. For a neutral scalar field $\\phi$ with mass $m$, Z is given by a functional integral over all field configurations:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n\nThe calculation is performed in Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate $t$ is replaced by imaginary time $\\tau = it$. The imaginary time is compactified on a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature (we set the Boltzmann constant $k_B=1$ and $\\hbar=1$).\n\nThe Euclidean action, $S_E$, for a free neutral scalar field is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$ over this Euclidean spacetime:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial_\\mu \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Inner Product and the Operator $D_\\phi$**\n\nThe quadratic nature of the action allows us to write it in a form that resembles a matrix product. By performing an integration by parts on the derivative terms (and noting that the boundary terms vanish due to the periodicity of $\\tau$ and the assumption that $\\phi \\to 0$ at spatial infinity), the action becomes:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left[ -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nThis expression has the form $S_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi)$.\nFrom this, we can identify:\n1.  **The Inner Product:** The notation $(\\psi, \\chi)$ represents an inner product on the space of fields, defined by integration over the Euclidean spacetime:\n    $(\\psi, \\chi) \\equiv \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\psi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\chi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n2.  **The Operator $D_\\phi$ (or simply $D$):** This is the differential operator acting on $\\phi$ in the expression for the action.\n    $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$\n    This is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean spacetime.\n\nThe quantity we need to compute is $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, which is precisely $2S_E$.\n\n**Step 3: Fourier Transform (Matsubara Formalism)**\n\nTo explicitly evaluate the inner product, it is most convenient to work in momentum space. The periodicity in the imaginary time direction, $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\tau + \\beta, \\vec{x})$, implies that the field can be expanded as a Fourier series in $\\tau$ and a Fourier transform in the spatial coordinates $\\vec{x}$.\n$\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{x})} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$ are the Fourier coefficients.\n*   $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta = 2\\pi n T$ are the discrete Matsubara frequencies for a boson. $n$ is any integer.\n*   $\\vec{p}$ is the continuous spatial momentum.\n*   The factor of temperature $T$ is a conventional normalization.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Inner Product in Momentum Space**\n\nWe now substitute the Fourier expansion of $\\phi$ into the expression for $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) (D\\phi)(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nFirst, let's see how the operator $D$ acts on a single Fourier mode:\n$D e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{x})} = (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{x})} = (\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2) e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{x})}$\n\nSo, in momentum space, the differential operator $D$ becomes a simple multiplication by its eigenvalue, $(\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2)$.\nNow, we can perform the integration. Substituting the Fourier series for both $\\phi$ fields in the inner product gives a complicated expression involving two sums and two integrals. However, the spacetime integral $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x$ acts on the exponential factors, producing Dirac delta functions that simplify the expression dramatically:\n$\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau e^{i(\\omega_n + \\omega_{n'}) \\tau} = \\beta \\delta_{n,-n'}$\n$\\int d^3x e^{i(\\vec{p} + \\vec{p}') \\cdot \\vec{x}} = (2\\pi)^3 \\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{p}+\\vec{p}')$\n\nUsing these identities collapses the two sums and two integrals into one of each. The final result of the integration is:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_{-n}, -\\vec{p}) (\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2) \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$\n\nSince the scalar field $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$ is real, its Fourier transform must satisfy the condition $\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_{-n}, -\\vec{p}) = \\tilde{\\phi}^*(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$, where $*$ denotes complex conjugation. Applying this gives the final form:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} (\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2) |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})|^2$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Euclidean Metric:** The calculation relies on the Euclidean metric signature $(+,+,+,+)$, where time and space are treated on equal footing.\n2.  **Imaginary Time Periodicity:** The choice of boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction is crucial. For bosons (like the scalar field), the condition is periodic, $\\phi(\\tau) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta)$, leading to integer Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n=2\\pi nT$. For fermions, the condition would be anti-periodic, leading to half-integer frequencies.\n3.  **Operator Form:** The operator $D = -\\partial_E^2+m^2$ is positive-definite, which is essential for the convergence of the functional integral.\n4.  **Reality of the Field:** The physical field $\\phi$ is real-valued, which imposes the condition $\\tilde{\\phi}(-k)=\\tilde{\\phi}^*(k)$ on its Fourier components, leading to the $|\\tilde{\\phi}|^2$ form.\n5.  **Interpretation:** The result represents twice the Euclidean action, $2S_E$, for a given field configuration $\\phi$, expressed as a sum over the contributions of all its independent Fourier modes.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is the value of the integral $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(x)(-\\partial_E^2+m^2)\\phi(x)$. Expressed in terms of the field's Matsubara-Fourier modes $\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$, it is given by:\n\n<<<T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} (\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2) |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})|^2>>>"
