    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"a joy-discovering sailor\"**\n    *   This is a poetic description by the poet Andrei Voznesensky.\n    *   \"Sailor\" (or navigator, explorer) suggests someone who traveled extensively, likely on a mission of discovery. It may be a metaphor, not a literal sailor.\n    *   \"Joy-discovering\" implies that the person's work was meant to bring happiness, progress, or relief to people.\n\n*   **Clue 2: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"**\n    *   This question, also from Voznesensky, is a powerful indicator. It means the man's burial place was unknown for a very long time.\n    *   This often points to individuals who died in tragic or mysterious circumstances, especially victims of political purges, whose bodies were disposed of in secret or in unmarked mass graves.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"**\n    *   This is a crucial historical anchor. The late 1980s in the Soviet Union was the period of *Glasnost* (openness) under Mikhail Gorbachev.\n    *   During this time, secret KGB archives were opened, and the fates of many victims of Stalin's purges were officially revealed. The locations of mass graves were investigated and made public. This clue strongly suggests the man was a victim of Stalinist repression.\n\n*   **Clue 4: Andrei Voznesensky is the author of the quote.**\n    *   Voznesensky was a prominent poet of the \"Sixties generation\" (*shestidesyatniki*), who often wrote about truth, history, and rehabilitating the memory of those unjustly persecuted.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Person**\n\n*   We are looking for a renowned Russian/Soviet figure.\n*   He was an \"explorer\" in a metaphorical sense, whose work was beneficial to humanity.\n*   He was a victim of political repression, and his burial site was unknown for decades.\n*   The truth about his death and grave location became widely known in the late 1980s.\n*   He was a figure admired by Andrei Voznesensky.\n\nThese clues point directly to **Nikolai Vavilov**.\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n1.  Was he a \"sailor\"? Nikolai Vavilov was a world-famous botanist and geneticist. He undertook more than 100 expeditions across five continents to collect seeds and plants, creating the world's largest seed bank. He was a scientific explorer who traveled the globe, fitting the \"sailor\" or \"navigator\" metaphor perfectly.\n2.  Was his work \"joy-discovering\"? Vavilov's goal was to use his collection to breed new, hardier crops to end famine in the Soviet Union and the world. This is a mission that would certainly bring \"joy\".\n3.  Was his grave unknown? Vavilov fell victim to the political pseudoscience of Trofim Lysenko. He was arrested in 1940, tried on fabricated charges, and died of starvation in a Saratov prison in 1943. He was buried in an unmarked common grave for prisoners, and its exact location was lost to history for many years.\n4.  Was the answer found in the late 1980s? While his official rehabilitation began after Stalin's death, the full public reckoning with his fate and the establishment of a memorial at his presumed mass burial site in Saratov gained significant momentum and publicity during the *Glasnost* era of the late 1980s.\n5.  Did Voznesensky write about him? Yes, Voznesensky greatly admired Vavilov and dedicated poetry to him, using phrases very similar to those in the question.\n\nThe question asks for the man's last name.\n\n<<<Vavilov>>>"
