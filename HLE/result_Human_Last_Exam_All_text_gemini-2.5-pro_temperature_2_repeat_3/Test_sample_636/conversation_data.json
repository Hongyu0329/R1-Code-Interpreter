    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\nWe are given a linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined by the matrices A and B:\n*   `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe objective is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system, governed by the matrix `A_cl = A + BF`, has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe eigenvalues of the closed-loop system are its poles. Given the desired poles `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`, we can find the desired characteristic polynomial, `p_d(s)`.\n`p_d(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2)`\n`p_d(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(s) = (s + 1 - j)(s + 1 + j)`\nUsing the formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2` with `a = s + 1` and `b = j`:\n`p_d(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n**3. Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl`**\nLet the state feedback gain matrix be `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\nFirst, we compute the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1, 1*f2]] = [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\nNext, we form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]] = [[-1 + f1 + 2f3, 1 + f2 + 2f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**4. Find the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is given by `p(s) = s^2 - trace(M)s + det(M)`.\nFor our closed-loop matrix `A_cl`:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2f4)(1 + f1)`\n\n**5. Match Coefficients to Find Equations for the Elements of F**\nWe equate the coefficients of the closed-loop characteristic polynomial with those of the desired polynomial, `p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\nThe general form is `s^2 - trace(A_cl)s + det(A_cl)`.\n1.  From the coefficient of `s`:\n    `-(trace(A_cl)) = 2`\n    `-(f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1) = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1 = -2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2f3 = -1` (Equation I)\n\n2.  From the constant term:\n    `det(A_cl) = 2`\n    `(-1 + f1 + 2f3)f2 - (1 + f2 + 2f4)(1 + f1) = 2` (Equation II)\n\n**6. Solve the System of Equations**\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`), which means there are infinite solutions. This is a common feature of multi-input control systems. We can find a particular solution by making simplifying choices. Let's assume `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0` to simplify the equations.\n\nWith `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`, the equations become:\n*   Equation I: `f1 + f2 = -1`\n*   Equation II: `(-1 + f1)f2 - (1 + f2)(1 + f1) = 2`\n\nLet's simplify Equation II:\n`-f2 + f1*f2 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2) = 2`\n`-f2 + f1*f2 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1*f2 = 2`\nCombine like terms:\n`-f1 - 2*f2 - 1 = 2`\n`-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations:\n(a) `f1 + f2 = -1`\n(b) `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nAdd equation (a) and (b):\n`(f1 - f1) + (f2 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into equation (a):\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nSo, we have found one possible set of values: `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\nThis gives the gain matrix:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**7. Verification**\nLet's check our result. With `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`, the closed-loop matrix is:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\n\nThe characteristic equation is `det(sI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[s, 1], [-2, s + 2]]) = s(s + 2) - (1)(-2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`\nThis is exactly the desired characteristic polynomial. The roots are `s = -1 Â± j`. Thus, the solution is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
