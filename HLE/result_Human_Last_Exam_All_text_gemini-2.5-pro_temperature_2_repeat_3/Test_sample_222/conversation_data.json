    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Define the target sequence and the goal\nLet the given 8-point sequence be denoted by `y(n)`.\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\nThe question asks for the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of this 8-point sequence. This is a non-standard operation. Typically, an N-point DFT is calculated for an N-point sequence. When calculating an N-point DFT for a sequence of length M > N, the standard interpretation is to first alias the sequence in the time domain.\n\n### Step 2: Time-Aliasing the Sequence\nTo find the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`, we first create a 4-point sequence, let's call it `y_a(n)`, by aliasing (or \"wrapping\") `y(n)`.\n`y_a(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nLet's write out the terms of `y_a(n)`:\n*   `y_a(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n*   `y_a(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n*   `y_a(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n*   `y_a(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\nThe goal is to find the 4-point DFT of this sequence `y_a(n)`, which we will call `Y_a(k)`.\n\n### Step 3: Relating the 4-point DFT to an 8-point DFT\nA fundamental property of the DFT is that time-aliasing corresponds to frequency-domain decimation (sampling). If `Y(k)` is the 8-point DFT of the original 8-point sequence `y(n)`, then the 4-point DFT of the aliased sequence `y_a(n)` is given by the even-indexed samples of `Y(k)`.\n`Y_a(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nSo, our task reduces to finding the values of the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` at indices `k = 0, 2, 4, 6`.\n\n### Step 4: Expressing the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` in terms of `X(k)` and `H(k)`\nThe sequence `y(n)` is an interleaving of `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We can express `y(n)` as the sum of two other 8-point sequences:\n1.  An up-sampled version of `x(n)`, let's call it `g_x(n) = {x(0), 0, x(1), 0, x(2), 0, x(3), 0}`.\n2.  An up-sampled and time-shifted version of `h(n)`, let's call it `g_h(n) = {0, h(0), 0, h(1), 0, h(2), 0, h(3)}`.\n\nBy linearity of the DFT, `Y(k) = G_x(k) + G_h(k)`, where `G_x(k)` and `G_h(k)` are the 8-point DFTs.\n\n*   **DFT of `g_x(n)`**: The up-sampling property states that if `g_x(n)` is `x(n)` up-sampled by 2 (one zero inserted between samples), its 8-point DFT `G_x(k)` is simply the 4-point DFT `X(k)` repeated. `G_x(k) = X(k mod 4)`.\n*   **DFT of `g_h(n)`**: `g_h(n)` is created by first up-sampling `h(n)` to get `{h(0), 0, h(1), 0, ...}` and then shifting the result by one sample to the right. The DFT of the up-sampled sequence is `H(k mod 4)`. The time-shift property states that a shift by 1 multiplies the DFT by `W_N^(1*k) = W_8^k`.\n    Therefore, `G_h(k) = H(k mod 4) * W_8^k`.\n\nCombining these, the 8-point DFT of `y(n)` is:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + H(k mod 4) * W_8^k`\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Required DFT points\nWe need to find `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\nThe 4-point twiddle factor is `W_4 = e^(-j*2*pi/4) = -j`. Its powers are `W_4^0=1`, `W_4^1=-j`, `W_4^2=-1`, `W_4^3=j`.\nThe 8-point twiddle factors we need are `W_8^(2k) = W_4^k`.\n\n**For k=0:** `Y_a(0) = Y(0)`\n`Y(0) = X(0 mod 4) + H(0 mod 4) * W_8^0 = X(0) + H(0) * 1`\nGiven `X(0)=1` and `H(0)=0`,\n`Y_a(0) = 1 + 0 * 1 = 1`\n\n**For k=1:** `Y_a(1) = Y(2)`\n`Y(2) = X(2 mod 4) + H(2 mod 4) * W_8^2 = X(2) + H(2) * W_4^1`\nGiven `X(2)=-1` and `H(2)=1`, and `W_4^1 = -j`.\n`Y_a(1) = -1 + 1 * (-j) = -1 - j`\n\n**For k=2:** `Y_a(2) = Y(4)`\n`Y(4) = X(4 mod 4) + H(4 mod 4) * W_8^4 = X(0) + H(0) * W_4^2`\nGiven `X(0)=1` and `H(0)=0`, and `W_4^2 = -1`.\n`Y_a(2) = 1 + 0 * (-1) = 1`\n\n**For k=3:** `Y_a(3) = Y(6)`\n`Y(6) = X(6 mod 4) + H(6 mod 4) * W_8^6 = X(2) + H(2) * W_4^3`\nGiven `X(2)=-1` and `H(2)=1`, and `W_4^3 = j`.\n`Y_a(3) = -1 + 1 * (j) = -1 + j`\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nCombining the results, the 4-point DFT of the interleaved sequence is:\n`Y_a(k) = {Y_a(0), Y_a(1), Y_a(2), Y_a(3)} = {1, -1-j, 1, -1+j}`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
