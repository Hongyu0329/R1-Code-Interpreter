    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules**\n\nThe algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This algebra is finite-dimensional, hereditary, and representation-finite. Its finite-dimensional modules can be identified with representations of the quiver $Q$.\n\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules are well-known and are denoted by $M(i,j)$ for $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. The module $M(i,j)$ corresponds to the representation with $\\mathbb{C}$ at vertices $k$ for $i \\le k \\le j$ and 0 otherwise, with identity maps between the non-zero vector spaces. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$ such modules. Let's identify them with the standard indecomposable projective, injective, and simple modules:\n\n*   **Simple modules:**\n    *   $S_1 = M(1,1)$, dimension vector $(1,0,0)$\n    *   $S_2 = M(2,2)$, dimension vector $(0,1,0)$\n    *   $S_3 = M(3,3)$, dimension vector $(0,0,1)$\n*   **Projective modules:** $P_i = Ae_i$\n    *   $P_1 = M(1,3)$, dimension vector $(1,1,1)$\n    *   $P_2 = M(2,3)$, dimension vector $(0,1,1)$\n    *   $P_3 = M(3,3) = S_3$\n*   **Injective modules:** $I_i = D(e_iA)$\n    *   $I_1 = M(1,1) = S_1$\n    *   $I_2 = M(1,2)$, dimension vector $(1,1,0)$\n    *   $I_3 = M(1,3) = P_1$\n\nSo, the six indecomposable modules are: $P_1 (=I_3)$, $P_2$, $S_3 (=P_3)$, $I_2$, $S_1 (=I_1)$, and $S_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting Theory for Hereditary Algebras**\n\nFor a hereditary algebra like $A$, the concepts of tilting modules and $\\tau$-tilting modules coincide. A module $T$ is a **$\\tau$-tilting module** if:\n1.  It is **$\\tau$-rigid**: $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$.\n2.  It is **maximal**: The number of non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands of $T$ is equal to the number of simple $A$-modules, which is $n=3$.\n\nThe Auslander-Reiten translate $\\tau$ is given by $\\tau M = D\\text{Ext}^1_A(M,A)$. For a non-projective indecomposable module $M(i,j)$ over $A=kQ$ where $Q$ is of type $A_n$ with linear orientation, $\\tau M(i,j) = M(i-1,j-1)$ (with $M(k,l)=0$ if $k>l$ or $k<1$ or $l<1$). For projective modules, $\\tau M=0$.\n\nLet's compute $\\tau M$ for the non-projective indecomposable modules:\n*   $S_1=M(1,1)$ is injective, hence non-projective. But $\\tau(I)=0$ for any injective $I$. So $\\tau S_1 = 0$.\n*   $I_2=M(1,2)$ is injective. So $\\tau I_2 = 0$.\n*   $S_2=M(2,2)$ is not projective. Applying the formula, $\\tau S_2 = \\tau M(2,2) = M(1,1) = S_1$.\n\nA module $M=\\bigoplus M_i$ is $\\tau$-rigid if $\\text{Hom}(M_i, \\tau M_j)=0$ for all pairs of summands $M_i, M_j$.\nIf a module $M$ contains $S_2$ as a summand, say $M=S_2\\oplus N$, for $M$ to be $\\tau$-rigid, we need $\\text{Hom}(S_2, \\tau S_2)=0$, $\\text{Hom}(N, \\tau S_2)=0$, $\\text{Hom}(S_2, \\tau N)=0$, and $\\text{Hom}(N, \\tau N)=0$.\nThe crucial condition involves $\\tau S_2=S_1$. Any summand $X$ of a $\\tau$-rigid module containing $S_2$ must satisfy $\\text{Hom}(X, S_1)=0$.\nThe modules $X$ with $\\text{Hom}(X,S_1)\\ne0$ are those $M(i,j)$ for which $i\\le 1 \\le 1 \\le j$. This means $i=1$. These are $M(1,1)=S_1$, $M(1,2)=I_2$, $M(1,3)=P_1$.\nThus, if $S_2$ is a summand of a $\\tau$-tilting module, none of $S_1, I_2, P_1$ can be summands.\nThe remaining indecomposable modules are $\\{P_2, S_3, S_2\\}$. To form a $\\tau$-tilting module of size 3 containing $S_2$, the only possibility is $T_S = S_2 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$.\nLet's verify that $T_S$ is indeed $\\tau$-tilting:\n$\\tau T_S = \\tau S_2 \\oplus \\tau P_2 \\oplus \\tau S_3 = S_1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 = S_1$.\nWe need $\\text{Hom}(T_S, S_1)=0$.\n$\\text{Hom}(S_2,S_1)=\\text{Hom}(M(2,2),M(1,1))=0$.\n$\\text{Hom}(P_2,S_1)=\\text{Hom}(M(2,3),M(1,1))=0$.\n$\\text{Hom}(S_3,S_1)=\\text{Hom}(M(3,3),M(1,1))=0$.\nSo $\\text{Hom}(T_S, \\tau T_S)=0$. It is $\\tau$-rigid and has 3 summands. Thus, $S_2 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$ is a $\\tau$-tilting module. It is the unique $\\tau$-tilting module containing $S_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Understand Slice Modules**\n\nA **slice module** is the direct sum of all indecomposable modules in a **slice**. For a hereditary algebra, a slice $S$ is a set of indecomposable modules satisfying:\n1.  For any indecomposable module $M$, the set $S$ contains exactly one module from the orbit $\\{\\tau^k M \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n2.  The set $S$ is convex with respect to irreducible maps.\n\nA key property of slice modules for representation-directed algebras (like our $A_3$ algebra) is that all their indecomposable summands are either preprojective or preinjective. An indecomposable module $M$ is **preprojective** if $\\tau^k(M)$ is projective for some $k \\geq 0$, and **preinjective** if $\\tau^{-k}(M)$ is injective for some $k \\geq 0$. For $A_n$, every module is either preprojective or preinjective; there are no regular modules in the strict sense (like tubes). However, we can think of modules \"in the middle\" of the AR quiver as being regular-like. $S_2=M(2,2)$ is such a module, as it is neither projective nor injective, nor is it $\\tau$-related to one in a single step (unlike $P_2,S_3,I_1,I_2$).\nA slice \"cuts\" through the AR quiver, from the projective side to the injective side. Such a cut cannot contain a module and also one of its predecessors or successors in its $\\tau$-orbit.\nThe indecomposable module $S_2=M(2,2)$ is the only indecomposable module that is not projective and not injective. Any other indecomposable module is either projective or injective (or both like $P_1=I_3$). Modules that are \"regular\" in flavor cannot belong to slice modules. The module $S_2$ can be seen as the unique regular indecomposable module.\nAll other $\\tau$-tilting modules for $A_3$ can be constructed as mutations of the basic tilting module $A=P_1\\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ (which is a slice module) or its dual, and lie entirely in the preprojective or preinjective components. These are slice modules.\n\nThe unique $\\tau$-tilting module $S_2 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$ contains the \"regular\" module $S_2$. Therefore, it cannot be a slice module, as a slice is a section of modules that are either all preprojective or all preinjective (generalized). The presence of $S_2$ breaks this structure. All other $\\tau$-tilting modules are formed by combining projectives and injectives, and can be shown to correspond to slices in the AR-quiver.\n\nThus, the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module is the one containing the unique \"regular\" indecomposable module $S_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nThe unique $\\tau$-tilting module containing $S_2$ is $S_2 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$. We write this using the $M(i,j)$ notation to be unambiguous.\n$S_2 = M(2,2)$\n$P_2 = M(2,3)$\n$S_3 = M(3,3)$\nThe module is $M(2,2) \\oplus M(2,3) \\oplus M(3,3)$."
