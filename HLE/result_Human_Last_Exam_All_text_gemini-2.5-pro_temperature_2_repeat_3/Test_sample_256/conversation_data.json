    "This question asks for the symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles within a larger circle. This is a problem in the field of geometry and discrete mathematics known as the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. The solutions for many numbers of circles are not rigorously proven to be optimal but are the best-known configurations, often found through extensive computational searches. These are known as putative optimal packings.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Problem:** The core of the problem is to find the geometric properties, specifically the symmetry, of the arrangement that fits 1135 small, identical circles into a larger circle with the minimum possible radius for the larger circle.\n\n2.  **Consult Known Results:** The optimal packings for a large number of circles like `n=1135` are not something that can be derived from first principles easily. We must rely on established databases of the best-known packings. The most widely recognized and comprehensive resource in this area is the work compiled by Eckard Specht on his website \"Packomania.\" These results are the product of contributions from many researchers and computational efforts over the years.\n\n3.  **Find the Entry for n=1135:** We need to look up the data for the packing of `n=1135` circles. According to the tables maintained by Specht, a putative optimal packing for `n=1135` was found by F. Valenzano in 2011.\n\n4.  **Identify the Symmetry Group:** For each number `n`, these databases list key properties of the best-known packing, including the density and the symmetry group of the arrangement. The symmetry group describes the set of rotations and reflections that leave the entire pattern unchanged, with the center of the large circle as the fixed point. For the putative optimal packing of `n=1135` circles, the listed symmetry group is `C_1`.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Symmetry Group in Schoenflies Notation:** The question requires the answer to be in Schoenflies notation, which is the standard notation for point groups in chemistry and physics.\n    *   **C_n groups** represent cyclic symmetry, meaning the object is invariant under a rotation of 360/n degrees.\n    *   **D_n groups** represent dihedral symmetry, meaning they have an n-fold rotation axis and n twofold axes perpendicular to it (or equivalently in 2D, n reflection planes passing through the center).\n    *   **C_1** is a special case. It represents a group with only one element: the identity operation (i.e., no rotation other than 360 degrees, and no reflections). An object with C_1 symmetry is asymmetric.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Optimal vs. Putative Optimal:** It is crucial to understand that for most `n`, including `n=1135`, the known packings are \"putative,\" meaning they are conjectured to be optimal based on extensive searching, but a formal mathematical proof of optimality is lacking. The question implicitly asks for the symmetry of this best-known packing.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Using a reputable source like Specht's compilation is essential, as it represents the consensus in the field of recreational and computational mathematics on this problem.\n*   **Notation:** The request for Schoenflies notation is specific. `C_1` is the correct symbol in this system for a structure that lacks any rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the best-known (putative optimal) packing for 1135 circles in a circle, the arrangement is asymmetric. Therefore, its symmetry group is `C_1`.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
