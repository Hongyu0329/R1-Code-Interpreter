    "This question asks to identify the most probable mechanism that allows duplicate genes to be kept in the genome (retention) and to become different from each other (divergence) over evolutionary time. Let's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** After a gene duplication event, an organism has two identical copies of a gene. Initially, one copy is redundant. Natural selection doesn't act strongly on this redundant copy, so it can accumulate mutations. The question asks what mechanism allows both copies to be kept and to evolve different sequences, implying that both eventually become functionally important. The most common fate of a duplicate gene is to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene. We are looking for a mechanism that avoids this fate and leads to the stable maintenance of two functional, but different, genes.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Option A: Gene Conversion:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** Gene conversion is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, it tends to make the copies identical or very similar.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This mechanism works *against* divergence. It promotes homogenization of gene families.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since gene conversion prevents or reverses divergence, it cannot be the primary mechanism responsible for the retention *and divergence* of duplicate genes.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Option B: Pseudogenization:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is the process where a gene copy becomes non-functional due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene because the redundant copy is not under strong selective pressure to maintain its function. While this leads to divergence of the DNA sequence, it does not lead to the *retention* of a functional gene. The gene is effectively lost.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Pseudogenization explains gene loss, not functional retention.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Option C: Neofunctionalization:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original function, while the second (redundant) copy accumulates mutations that randomly result in a brand-new, beneficial function. Natural selection will then preserve this new gene.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This model successfully explains both retention (as both the original and new functions are beneficial) and divergence (as the second copy evolves a new function and sequence). However, the redundant copy is at high risk of becoming a pseudogene during the time it takes to acquire a rare gain-of-function mutation. This \"race against time\" makes this event potentially infrequent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a valid and important mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Option D: Subfunctionalization:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** This model applies when the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions (pleiotropy) or complex regulation (e.g., expressed in different tissues). After duplication, each copy can accumulate loss-of-function mutations that disable different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function A but keeps B, while copy 2 loses function B but keeps A. Now, both copies are essential to carry out the full set of original functions. This is also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This model also explains both retention (both copies are now necessary) and divergence (the copies specialize). Crucially, it provides a very plausible way for both copies to be preserved from pseudogenization quickly, because it relies on relatively common loss-of-function mutations, rather than rare gain-of-function mutations.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is also a valid and important mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Option E: Adaptive Radiation:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species that fill different ecological niches.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Gene duplication is a source of genetic novelty that can *fuel* adaptive radiation, but adaptive radiation itself is not the molecular mechanism responsible for retaining a specific pair of duplicate genes. This option describes a pattern at the species level, not a process at the gene level.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the wrong level of biological organization.\n\n### Comparison and Final Decision\n\nWe are left with two strong candidates: Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D). The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n\n*   The subfunctionalization model addresses a key challenge of the neofunctionalization model: how the duplicate gene survives the period of redundancy without being lost to pseudogenization.\n*   Subfunctionalization relies on the partitioning of existing functions via relatively common degenerative mutations. This provides a quick and robust path to a state where both gene copies are maintained by purifying selection.\n*   Neofunctionalization relies on the evolution of a completely new function from a redundant copy, which requires a specific and rare gain-of-function mutation to occur before an inactivating mutation does.\n*   Because the genetic path to subfunctionalization is considered more probable (relying on more common types of mutations), many evolutionary biologists consider it a more likely mechanism, at least for the initial preservation of duplicated genes.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is often considered the most likely general mechanism for ensuring the retention of gene duplicates, which then allows for their subsequent divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
