    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\n    *   SPDC is a quantum optical process where a single high-energy photon (the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and is split into a pair of lower-energy photons (traditionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\").\n    *   This process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n    *   Critically, SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical effect**. The efficiency of this process is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as `χ⁽²⁾` (chi-two).\n\n2.  **Identify the Fundamental Requirement for SPDC**\n    *   For a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear effect, including SPDC, it must have a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾`.\n    *   There is a strict, fundamental symmetry rule for `χ⁽²⁾`: in the electric dipole approximation (which is the dominant mechanism), `χ⁽²⁾` is non-zero **if and only if the material's crystal structure lacks a center of inversion symmetry**. Such materials are called non-centrosymmetric.\n    *   In a material that is centrosymmetric (possesses a center of inversion), the second-order polarization effects cancel out, leading to `χ⁽²⁾ = 0`. Therefore, centrosymmetric materials cannot exhibit SPDC through the standard mechanism.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Material in Question: Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n    *   \"Boron nanosheets,\" or borophene, are 2D allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single stable hexagonal structure, borophene is polymorphic, meaning it can exist in several different structural phases.\n    *   The question specifies \"free-standing\" nanosheets, which means we must consider the intrinsic properties of the material itself, without the influence of a substrate that could break symmetry.\n    *   We must examine the crystal structure of the most common and stable predicted phases of free-standing borophene. The most widely studied phases include the β₁₂ sheet and the χ₃ sheet.\n\n4.  **Determine the Symmetry of Borophene Phases**\n    *   The ideal, planar structures of the common borophene phases (like β₁₂ and χ₃) are **centrosymmetric**. They possess a center of inversion symmetry within the plane of the sheet.\n    *   For example, the β₁₂ phase has a *Pmmm* space group, and the χ₃ phase has a *Cmcm* space group, both of which are centrosymmetric.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Conclusion**\n    *   **Premise 1:** SPDC requires a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾`.\n    *   **Premise 2:** A non-zero `χ⁽²⁾` requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n    *   **Premise 3:** Free-standing boron nanosheets, in their ideal and most stable forms, have centrosymmetric crystal structures.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Therefore, the intrinsic `χ⁽²⁾` of free-standing boron nanosheets is expected to be zero. As a result, they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Comparison to Other 2D Materials:** This conclusion is consistent with observations in other 2D materials. Graphene, which is also centrosymmetric, does not exhibit SPDC. In contrast, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (like MoS₂) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are non-centrosymmetric and are known to exhibit strong second-order nonlinear effects, including SPDC.\n2.  **Edge Cases:** While the intrinsic bulk (in a 2D sense) property of borophene forbids SPDC, there are exceptions that could induce the effect, though not as an intrinsic property of the ideal sheet:\n    *   **Strain/Defects:** Non-uniform strain or certain types of defects could locally break the inversion symmetry, potentially allowing for a weak `χ⁽²⁾` response in those specific areas.\n    *   **Substrate Interaction:** If the borophene sheet were on a substrate, the interaction could break the overall symmetry of the system, potentially inducing a `χ⁽²⁾` response. However, the question specifically asks about \"free-standing\" sheets.\n    *   **Higher-Order Effects:** Extremely weak second-order responses can arise from electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole interactions even in centrosymmetric materials, but these are typically many orders of magnitude weaker than the electric-dipole-allowed process in non-centrosymmetric materials and are considered negligible for practical purposes.\n\nBased on the primary, intrinsic properties of the material as requested, the final answer is a clear negative.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The fundamental reason is that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to lack a center of inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric, and therefore have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`), which forbids this effect.>>>"
