No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The fundamental reason is that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to lack a center of inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric, and therefore have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`), which forbids this effect.
