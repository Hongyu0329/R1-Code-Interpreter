    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Geometry of the Problem**\nWe are given a triangle $ABC$ with the following properties:\n*   Side $BC$, let's call its length $a$, is equal to $S$.\n*   Angle $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n*   Side $AC$, let's call its length $b$. We need to find the number of possible integer values for $b$.\n*   Side $AB$, let's call its length $c$.\nThe core condition is that there must be exactly two possible values for the side length $AB$ (or $c$). This describes the \"ambiguous case\" in trigonometry.\n\n**Step 2: Deriving the Condition for Two Possible Triangles**\nThe condition for two possible triangles can be understood by visualizing the construction. Imagine drawing the side $BC$ of length $S$ and the ray $BA$ forming a $30^{\\circ}$ angle with $BC$. The vertex $A$ must lie on this ray. The vertex $C$ is fixed. The possible locations for vertex $A$ are determined by the intersection of the ray $BA$ and a circle centered at $C$ with radius $AC = b$.\nFor there to be two distinct intersection points (and thus two possible triangles), the radius $b$ must be greater than the perpendicular distance from $C$ to the line containing $BA$, but less than the length of the side $BC$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the altitude:** Let $h$ be the length of the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$.\n    $h = a \\sin B = S \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = S \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{S}{2}$.\n    For any triangle to exist, $b$ must be at least $h$. If $b=h$, there is exactly one solution for the triangle (a right-angled triangle). If $b>h$, there are two intersection points with the line containing AB.\n\n2.  **Ensure two valid triangles:** When $b > h$, the circle centered at C with radius b intersects the line containing side AB at two points, let's call them $A_1$ and $A_2$. This gives two potential lengths for the side $AB$: $c_1=BA_1$ and $c_2=BA_2$. For both of these to form valid triangles, both $c_1$ and $c_2$ must be positive. One length will always be positive. The other is positive only if the circle's radius $b=AC$ is shorter than the side $a=BC$.\n    So, the condition for two distinct, valid triangles is $h < b < a$.\n\n3.  **Final inequality:** Substituting our values, we get:\n    $\\frac{S}{2} < b < S$.\n    The question asks for the number of integer values for $AC = b$ that satisfy this inequality.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the Number of Integer Solutions**\nWe need to count the number of integers in the open interval $(\\frac{S}{2}, S)$.\nLet $N$ be the number of such integers.\nThe smallest integer greater than $\\frac{S}{2}$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{S}{2} \\rfloor + 1$.\nThe largest integer less than $S$ is $S-1$ (assuming S is an integer, which is standard in such problems).\nThe number of integers is the difference between the largest and smallest, plus one.\n$N = (S-1) - (\\lfloor \\frac{S}{2} \\rfloor + 1) + 1 = S - 1 - \\lfloor \\frac{S}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\nWe can also express this using a single formula. The number of integers is $\\lfloor(S-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n*   If $S$ is even, let $S=2k$. $N = \\lfloor(2k-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor k - 0.5 \\rfloor = k-1 = S/2 - 1$.\n*   If $S$ is odd, let $S=2k+1$. $N = \\lfloor(2k+1-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor k \\rfloor = k = (S-1)/2$.\n\n**Step 4: Determining the value of S**\nThe problem states $S=SNYWR$. This is not a standard mathematical notation. In contests where this format appears, SNYWR is often a placeholder for a specific number provided for the contest, or it needs to be decoded from the letters. Without external context, a reasonable interpretation is to decode the string using a common method like the A1Z26 cipher (A=1, B=2, ...).\n*   S = 19\n*   N = 14\n*   Y = 25\n*   W = 23\n*   R = 18\n\nThe value of $S$ is assumed to be the sum of these numbers.\n$S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\nNow we use the value $S=99$ in our formula to find the number of integer values for $AC$.\nSince $S=99$ is an odd number, we use the formula for odd S:\nNumber of values = $\\frac{S-1}{2}$.\nNumber of values = $\\frac{99-1}{2} = \\frac{98}{2} = 49$.\n\nAlternatively, using the inequality:\n$\\frac{99}{2} < b < 99$\n$49.5 < b < 99$\nThe integer values for $b$ are $50, 51, \\dots, 98$.\nThe number of these integers is $98 - 50 + 1 = 49$.\n\n<<<49>>>"
