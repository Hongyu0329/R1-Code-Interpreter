    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the duration of the \"Second Great War\" in the StarCraft lore. This specific conflict is the central storyline of the *StarCraft II* trilogy.\n\n2.  **Establish the Timeline:** To determine the duration, we need to find the start and end dates of this war according to the official StarCraft lore.\n    *   **Start of the War:** The Second Great War begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. The opening cinematic and the first mission on Mar Sara, where the Zerg re-invade Dominion space, mark the start of the conflict. This occurs in the year **2504**.\n    *   **End of the War:** The war's climax and conclusion are depicted in *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* and its epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void.\" The war ends when the united forces of the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg confront and defeat the dark god Amon, ending his galaxy-wide threat. These final events take place in the year **2506**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Duration:**\n    *   The war begins in the year **2504**.\n    *   The war ends in the year **2506**.\n    *   The conflict spans across parts of three separate calendar years: 2504, 2505 (the year in which the events of *Heart of the Swarm* primarily take place), and 2506.\n\n4.  **Analyze \"Duration\" vs. \"Difference in Years\":**\n    *   A simple subtraction of the years (2506 - 2504) gives 2. However, this doesn't represent the full duration.\n    *   An event that starts at any point in 2504 and ends at any point in 2506 must have a duration that is greater than one year (it includes all of 2505) and is very likely greater than two years (e.g., a start in mid-2504 and an end in mid-2506 would be exactly two years, but the campaigns take time).\n    *   The conflict spans from the *Wings of Liberty* campaign (2504), through the *Heart of the Swarm* campaign (2505), to the conclusion of the *Legacy of the Void* campaign (2506). This means the total elapsed time is somewhere over two full years. Let's denote this duration as `2.x` years.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:** The question explicitly states to round the duration **up** to the nearest whole year.\n    *   The calculated duration is `2.x` years (a value greater than 2 but less than 3).\n    *   Rounding any number between 2.01 and 2.99 *up* to the nearest whole number results in **3**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing First and Second Great Wars:** The \"Great War\" refers to the events of the original *StarCraft* and its *Brood War* expansion (c. 2499-2500). The \"Second Great War\" refers specifically to the conflict against Amon in *StarCraft II* (2504-2506). It's crucial not to confuse the two.\n*   **Exact Dates vs. Years:** StarCraft lore often provides years for major events but rarely specifies exact months or days. We must work with the given years and infer the duration.\n*   **Interpreting \"Rounded Up\":** This is the key instruction. Simply subtracting the years (2506 - 2504 = 2) would ignore this instruction and the fact that the conflict spans parts of three years, making its true duration greater than two full years. Rounding up is a specific mathematical operation that forces any fractional result to the next highest integer.\n\n### Final Calculation\n*   Start Year: 2504\n*   End Year: 2506\n*   Elapsed Time: Greater than 2 years (e.g., 2 years and some months).\n*   Result after rounding up: 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
