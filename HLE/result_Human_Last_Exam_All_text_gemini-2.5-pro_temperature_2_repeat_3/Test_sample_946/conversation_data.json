    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Source Material:** \"Homestar Runner\" online cartoon series.\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Setting:** Junior prom.\n*   **Performer:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Identity:** A fictional singer.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThis episode follows Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One as they prepare for and attend their junior prom. The theme of the prom is \"a night of dancing and putting your feet in a tub of grape juice.\"\n\n**Step 3: Focus on the scene at the junior prom itself.**\nDuring the prom scene, there is music playing. The source of the music, or the \"live entertainment,\" needs to be identified.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"performer\".**\nInstead of a live band, the episode shows a cardboard cutout on the stage. The characters comment on the musical guest.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the name of the fictional singer/band represented by the cutout.**\nThe cardboard cutout is of the lead singer of the fictional glam metal band from the Homestar Runner universe. The name of this band is \"Taranchula\". Although the cutout is of one member, the band itself is the musical act.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The question specifies a \"fictional singer\". Taranchula is a fictional band, and the cutout is of its lead singer. Naming the band is the most accurate way to identify the musical act.\n*   It is explicitly a cardboard cutout, not a real animated character performing. This is a key comedic element of the scene.\n*   The specific episode number, #15, is crucial as other episodes might feature different musical guests or events.\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively identify the fictional act at the prom.\n\n<<<Taranchula>>>"
