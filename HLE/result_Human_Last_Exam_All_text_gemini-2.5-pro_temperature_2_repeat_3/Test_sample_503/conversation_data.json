    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the context\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the category in question.\n*   **The simplex category $\\Delta$**: Its objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for any integer $n \\ge 0$. A morphism from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **As a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$**: This tells us how to view $\\Delta$ as a 2-category. The objects are the same ([n]). The 1-morphisms are the order-preserving maps. The new structure is that of 2-morphisms. For any two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order. That is, $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. Since this defines a partial order on the set of morphisms $\\text{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m],[n])$, there is at most one 2-morphism between any two parallel 1-morphisms. This makes $\\Delta$ a \"locally posetal\" 2-category.\n\n### Step 2: Define an internal adjunction\nAn internal adjunction from an object $A$ to an object $B$ in a 2-category consists of:\n1.  A pair of 1-morphisms (called adjoints): a left adjoint $L: A \\to B$ and a right adjoint $R: B \\to A$.\n2.  Two 2-morphisms: the unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\varepsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_B$.\nThese must satisfy the triangle identities. However, because our 2-category is locally posetal, these identities are automatically satisfied if the unit and counit exist.\n\nIn our specific case, an adjunction from $[23]$ to $[37]$ means we have:\n*   A left adjoint $L: [23] \\to [37]$, which is an order-preserving map.\n*   A right adjoint $R: [37] \\to [23]$, which is an order-preserving map.\n*   A unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$. This means $\\text{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$, so $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n*   A counit $\\varepsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_{[37]}$. This means $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, so $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThe two inequalities $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$ are the conditions defining a **Galois connection** between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$. So, we need to count the number of such Galois connections.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps\nA Galois connection is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint $L$ or the right adjoint $R$. A map is a left (or right) adjoint if it satisfies certain properties. Let's find these properties.\nA pair of maps $(L,R)$ is a Galois connection if and only if for all $i \\in [23], j \\in [37]$:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\n\nThis equivalence allows one map to be constructed from the other.\n*   If we know $L$, then $R$ is given by $R(j) = \\max \\{i \\in [23] \\mid L(i) \\le j \\}$.\n*   If we know $R$, then $L$ is given by $L(i) = \\min \\{j \\in [37] \\mid i \\le R(j) \\}$.\n\nFor these definitions to be valid, the sets on the right-hand side must have a maximum or a minimum element, respectively. Since the sets are subsets of finite total orders, this is equivalent to the sets being non-empty.\n\n**Condition for L to be a left adjoint:**\nFor $R(j)$ to be well-defined for all $j \\in [37]$, the set $\\{i \\in [23] \\mid L(i) \\le j \\}$ must be non-empty for all $j \\in [37]$. Since $L$ is order-preserving, if this holds for $j=0$, it holds for all $j>0$. For $j=0$, we need some $i \\in [23]$ such that $L(i) \\le 0$. Since the codomain of $L$ is $[37]$, this implies $L(i)=0$. As $L$ is order-preserving, this forces $L(0)=0$. This condition is also sufficient. Thus, a map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $L(0)=0$.\n\n**Condition for R to be a right adjoint:**\nFor $L(i)$ to be well-defined for all $i \\in [23]$, the set $\\{j \\in [37] \\mid i \\le R(j) \\}$ must be non-empty for all $i \\in [23]$. Since $R$ is order-preserving, if this holds for $i=23$, it holds for all $i<23$. For $i=23$, we need some $j \\in [37]$ such that $23 \\le R(j)$. Since the codomain of $R$ is $[23]$, this implies $R(j)=23$. As $R$ is order-preserving, this forces $R(37)=23$. This condition is also sufficient. Thus, a map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $R(37)=23$.\n\nEach such $L$ determines a unique $R$, and vice-versa, so counting the number of possible left adjoints $L$ will give the total number of adjunctions.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of valid maps\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$ and each $L(i) \\in [37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThe additional condition is $L(0)=0$. So we are looking for non-decreasing sequences:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $L(0)$ is fixed, we need to choose the values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. This is a sequence of 23 numbers that must be non-decreasing, and each value must be in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $38$ elements) with replacement, and the order of selection does not matter as it will be arranged non-decreasingly.\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ types with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient $\\binom{k+n-1}{k}$.\n*   The number of items to choose is $k = 23$ (the values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$).\n*   The number of available types is $n = 38$ (the possible values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$).\n\nThe total number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{23 + 38 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n(As a check, we could also count the right adjoints $R:[37]\\to[23]$ with $R(37)=23$. This would require counting non-decreasing sequences $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ taking values in $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. Here $k=37$, $n=24$. This gives $\\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$. Since $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$, the results match.)\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is therefore $\\binom{60}{23}$."
