    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of empty edge squares.\n\n### Step 1: Identify and Count the Edge Squares\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The \"edge squares\" are those in the first and last rows, and the first and last columns.\n*   The top row (rank 1) has 8 squares.\n*   The bottom row (rank 8) has 8 squares.\n*   The first column (file 'a') has 8 squares, but the two corner squares (a1, a8) have already been counted in the rows. This adds 6 more squares.\n*   The last column (file 'h') also has 8 squares, and its two corners (h1, h8) have also been counted. This adds another 6 squares.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Movement and Constraints\nA bishop attacks any number of squares along a diagonal. A crucial point is that a bishop on a white square can only attack other white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other black squares.\nThe goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on these 28 edge squares.\nThis means we can solve the problem in two independent parts:\n1.  Place the maximum number of bishops on the white edge squares.\n2.  Place the maximum number of bishops on the black edge squares.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the White Edge Squares\nThere are 14 white edge squares on a chessboard. They are: b1, d1, f1, h1, a2, a4, a6, a8, c8, e8, g8, h3, h5, h7. We need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on these 14 squares.\n\nLet's try a constructive approach:\n*   Place bishops on all the white squares in the first row: `b1, d1, f1, h1`. This is a set of **4** validly placed bishops, as they do not attack each other.\n*   Now, let's see which other white edge squares are attacked by these 4 bishops:\n    *   The bishop on `b1` attacks `a2` and `h7`.\n    *   The bishop on `d1` attacks `a4` and `h5`.\n    *   The bishop on `f1` attacks `a6` and `h3`.\n    *   The bishop on `h1` attacks `a8`.\n*   The white edge squares that are **not** occupied and **not** attacked are: `c8, e8, g8`.\n*   These three squares (`c8, e8, g8`) do not attack each other. They also are not attacked by our first set of bishops.\n*   Therefore, we can add bishops on `c8, e8, g8`. This adds **3** more bishops.\n*   Our final set for white squares is {b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8}. This gives a total of 4 + 3 = **7** bishops. All other white edge squares are either occupied or attacked. Thus, 7 is the maximum number of bishops on the white edge squares.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Black Edge Squares\nThere are also 14 black edge squares: a1, c1, e1, g1, a3, a5, a7, b8, d8, f8, h8, h2, h4, h6. The layout and connectivity of black squares are different from the white ones, so we cannot assume the result will be the same.\n\nLet's use the same constructive approach:\n*   Place bishops on all the black squares in the first row: `a1, c1, e1, g1`. This is a set of **4** validly placed bishops.\n*   Now, let's identify the other black edge squares attacked by this set:\n    *   The bishop on `a1` attacks `h8`.\n    *   The bishop on `c1` attacks `a3`.\n    *   The bishop on `e1` attacks `a5` and `h4`.\n    *   The bishop on `g1` attacks `a7` and `h2`.\n*   The black edge squares that are **not** occupied and **not** attacked are: `b8, d8, f8, h6`.\n*   These four squares (`b8, d8, f8, h6`) do not attack each other, nor are they attacked by our first set.\n*   So, we can add bishops on `b8, d8, f8, h6`. This adds **4** more bishops.\n*   Our final set for black squares is {a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, f8, h6}. This gives a total of 4 + 4 = **8** bishops. All other black edge squares are either occupied or attacked. Thus, 8 is the maximum for the black edge squares.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Maximum bishops on white edge squares = 7\n*   Maximum bishops on black edge squares = 8\n*   The total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 7 + 8 = **15**.\n*   The question asks how many edge squares would **lack** bishops.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = (Total edge squares) - (Total placed bishops)\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 15 = 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
