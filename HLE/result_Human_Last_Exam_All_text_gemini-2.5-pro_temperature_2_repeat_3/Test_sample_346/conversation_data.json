    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n**1. Understand the Building Blocks**\n\nFirst, let's define the fundamental combinators and their reduction rules:\n*   `I x` → `x` (Identity)\n*   `K x y` → `x` (Constant)\n*   `S x y z` → `x z (y z)` (Substitution)\n\nFrom these, we can define other useful combinators:\n*   **B Combinator (Composition):** `B x y z` → `x (y z)`. It can be defined as `S(KS)K`. In the expression, we find `S(S(K(S))(K))`. Let's check this: `S(KS)K x y z = (KS)x(Kx)y z = S(Kx)y z = Kx z (y z) = x (y z)`. The provided expression has a slightly different bracketing `S(K(S))(K)`. Let's analyze it: `S(K S)K` is `((S(KS))K)`. `S(K(S))(K)` is `((S(K S))K)`. They are the same. Let's call `B = S(S(K(S))(K))`.\n*   **U Combinator (Self-application/Omega):** `U x` → `x x`. It can be defined as `S I I`. We can verify this: `S I I x → I x (I x) → x x`. The sub-expression `S(I)(I)` is `U`.\n\n**2. Simplifying the Expression's Components**\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's replace the identified combinators `B` and `U`:\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` becomes `B I`.\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` becomes `B U`.\n\nThe expression becomes:\n`S(I) (S(I) (S(I) (K(B I)))) (B U))`\n\nThere's one more important component inside the `K` combinator. Let's look at `B I`. But wait, the `S` in `S(S(K(S))(K))` is `B`'s definition, so it takes arguments. The term is `S(B)(I)` or `S B I`.\nThis is the successor function for Church numerals applied to the numeral `1` (`I`).\n*   **Successor (SUCC):** `SUCC n = S B n`. It increments a Church numeral `n`.\n*   **Church Numeral [2]:** `[2] = SUCC [1] = SUCC I = S B I`.\nLet's verify: `S B I f x → B f (I f) x → f ((I f) x) → f (f x)`. This correctly represents `f` applied twice to `x`, which is the definition of Church numeral 2.\n\nThe innermost term `K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))` is `K(S B I)`, which simplifies to `K [2]`.\n\nSo the expression is now: `S(I) (S(I) (S(I) (K [2]))) (B U))`\n\n**3. Parsing and Reducing the Main Expression**\n\nCombinator application is left-associative, so `A B C D` means `(((A B) C) D)`. We parse the expression accordingly. Let's evaluate it from the inside-out based on this structure.\n\nLet `A = S I`. We know `A g y = I y (g y) = y(gy)`.\nLet the expression be `Term_2 (B U)`, where `Term_2 = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K [2])))`.\n\n*   **Step a:** Let `Term_0 = K [2]`.\n*   **Step b:** Let `Term_1 = S(I)(Term_0)`. We apply this to a generic argument `y`:\n    `Term_1 y = (S I) Term_0 y = y (Term_0 y) = y ( (K [2]) y ) = y [2]`.\n    So, `Term_1` is the function `λy. y [2]`.\n*   **Step c:** Now let `Term_2 = S(I)(Term_1)`. We apply this to a generic argument `y`:\n    `Term_2 y = (S I) Term_1 y = y (Term_1 y) = y ( (λz. z [2]) y ) = y (y [2])`.\n    So, `Term_2` is the function `λy. y (y [2])`.\n\nThe full expression `n` is `Term_2 (B U)`.\n`n = (λy. y (y [2])) (B U)`.\nApplying the lambda, we substitute `(B U)` for `y`:\n`n = (B U) ( (B U) [2] )`\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Expression**\n\nLet's define an operator `F = B U`. Our expression for the church integer `n` is `n = F(F[2])`. We need to determine what the operator `F` does to a Church numeral. Let `[k]` be a generic Church numeral.\n\n`F[k] = (B U) [k]`\n\nTo find out what numeral this represents, we apply it to a function `f` and a value `x`.\n`(F[k]) f x = ((B U) [k]) f x`\nUsing the rule for B: `B g h z = g(hz)`\n`= (U ([k] f)) x`\nUsing the rule for U: `U g = g g`\n`= ( ([k] f) ([k] f) ) x`\n\nHere `[k] f` is the function `λy. f^k(y)`. Let's call it `h_k`. The expression becomes `(h_k h_k) x`. This means we apply `h_k` to `h_k` itself, and then apply the result to `x`.\n`h_k h_k = (λy. f^k(y)) (h_k) = f^k(h_k)`\nThe result is a function. We apply it to `x`:\n`(f^k(h_k)) (x)`\nThis is function composition, so `f^k(h_k(x))`.\nWe know `h_k(x) = ([k]f) x = f^k(x)`.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n`f^k(f^k(x))`\nThis means we apply `f` `k` times to the result of applying `f` `k` times to `x`. In total, `f` is applied `k+k = 2k` times.\n`f^(2k)(x)`.\n\nThis shows that `F[k]` is the Church numeral for `2k`. The operator `F` is a **doubling operator** for Church numerals.\n\nNow we can evaluate `n`.\n`n = F ( F[2] )`\n`F[2]` means we apply the doubling operator to the numeral 2. `2 * 2 = 4`. So `F[2] = [4]`.\n`n = F[4]`.\nNow we apply the doubling operator to the numeral 4. `2 * 4 = 8`. So `F[4] = [8]`.\n\nThe Church integer `n` represented by the expression is 8.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n`n = 8`\n`log_2(8) = 3`\n\n<<<3>>>"
