    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in the momentum of an electron (Δp) to its momentum (p) in the first Bohr orbit, given a specific uncertainty in its position (Δx).\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the ratio `Δp / p`.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   The particle is an electron.\n*   The orbit is the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n*   The uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx = 10 pm.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The mathematical relation is `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`h / 2π`). We will use the minimum uncertainty for our calculation: `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n2.  **Bohr Model:** We need to find the momentum (p) of an electron in the first Bohr orbit. According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) is quantized: `L = nħ`, where `n` is the principal quantum number.\n3.  **Relationship between Linear and Angular Momentum:** For an object in a circular orbit, angular momentum `L` is related to linear momentum `p` and radius `r` by the formula `L = p * r`.\n4.  **Bohr Radius:** The radius of the first Bohr orbit (n=1) is a known constant, denoted as `a₀` or `r₁`, with a value of approximately `52.9 pm`.\n5.  **Unit Consistency:** The units for position (Δx) and radius (r₁) are both given in picometers (pm). Since we are calculating a ratio, the units will cancel out, simplifying the calculation.\n    *   `1 pm = 10⁻¹² m`\n    *   Δx = 10 pm\n    *   r₁ ≈ 52.9 pm\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)\n\nWe use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find Δp.\n\n*   Formula: `Δx * Δp = ħ / 2`\n*   Solving for Δp: `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n\nWe will leave this in terms of `ħ` for now, as it might cancel out later.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Momentum (p) in the First Bohr Orbit\n\nWe use the postulates of the Bohr model to find p.\n\n1.  The angular momentum (L) in the nth orbit is given by `L = nħ`.\n2.  For the first Bohr orbit, n = 1, so `L = 1 * ħ = ħ`.\n3.  The angular momentum is also given by `L = p * r`.\n4.  For the first orbit, `L = p * r₁`, where `r₁` is the Bohr radius.\n5.  Equating the two expressions for L: `p * r₁ = ħ`.\n6.  Solving for momentum (p): `p = ħ / r₁`.\n\nThe value of the Bohr radius, `r₁`, is approximately `52.9 pm`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio (Δp / p)\n\nNow we can compute the desired ratio using the expressions from the previous steps.\n\n*   Ratio = `Δp / p`\n*   Substitute the expressions for Δp and p:\n    `Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / r₁)`\n\n*   We can cancel the reduced Planck constant `ħ` from the numerator and denominator:\n    `Ratio = (1 / (2 * Δx)) / (1 / r₁)`\n\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    `Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n### Step 4: Substitute Values and Find the Final Answer\n\nNow we plug in the known values for `r₁` and `Δx`.\n\n*   `r₁ = 52.9 pm`\n*   `Δx = 10 pm`\n\n`Ratio = 52.9 pm / (2 * 10 pm)`\n`Ratio = 52.9 pm / 20 pm`\n`Ratio = 2.645`\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity. The result indicates that the uncertainty in the electron's momentum is more than 2.6 times its calculated momentum, highlighting the conflict between the classical-like Bohr orbits and the inherent uncertainty of quantum mechanics.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
