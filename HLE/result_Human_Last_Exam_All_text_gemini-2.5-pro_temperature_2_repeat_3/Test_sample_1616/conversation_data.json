    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept - Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing (or Trisyllabic Shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long or tense vowel becomes short or lax when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of a word).\n\n*   A classic example is `sane` (tense vowel /eɪ/) becoming `sanity` (lax vowel /æ/). The syllable `san-` is the third from the end in `san-i-ty`, so the rule applies.\n*   Another example is `divine` (tense diphthong /aɪ/) becoming `divinity` (lax vowel /ɪ/). The syllable `vin-` in `di-vin-i-ty` is the third from the end.\n\nThis rule is part of a larger family of sound changes where vowels were shortened in certain environments, such as before consonant clusters (`-nt`, `-st`) or in derived words. The question is likely using \"trisyllabic laxing\" to refer to this general category of vowel shortening in derived words. The key is to find a word that has a lax vowel for reasons *other than* this type of historical shortening from a tense-vowel base.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word by comparing it to its base form or a related word.**\n\n1.  **southern**:\n    *   Base word: `south` (pronounced /saʊθ/). The /aʊ/ diphthong is a tense vowel.\n    *   Derived word: `southern` (pronounced /ˈsʌðərn/). The vowel becomes /ʌ/, a lax vowel.\n    *   Analysis: The vowel has laxed due to the addition of the suffix. Although `southern` is only two syllables long, this is a well-known example of this type of historical shortening (specifically, shortening before the `-ern` suffix). Thus, it **has undergone** this process.\n\n2.  **derivative**:\n    *   Base word: `derive` (pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/). The vowel in the stressed syllable is the tense diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   Derived word: `derivative` (pronounced /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/).\n    *   Analysis: The corresponding syllable (`-riv-`) is the third from the end (`de-riv-a-tive`). Its vowel has changed from /aɪ/ to the lax vowel /ɪ/. This is a textbook example of trisyllabic laxing. Thus, it **has undergone** the process.\n\n3.  **serenity**:\n    *   Base word: `serene` (pronounced /səˈriːn/). The vowel in the stressed syllable is the tense vowel /iː/.\n    *   Derived word: `serenity` (pronounced /səˈrɛnəti/).\n    *   Analysis: The corresponding syllable (`-ren-`) is the third from the end (`se-ren-i-ty`). Its vowel has changed from /iː/ to the lax vowel /ɛ/. This is another classic example of trisyllabic laxing. Thus, it **has undergone** the process.\n\n4.  **pleasant**:\n    *   Base word: `please` (pronounced /pliːz/). The vowel is the tense vowel /iː/.\n    *   Derived word: `pleasant` (pronounced /ˈplɛzənt/). The vowel becomes /ɛ/, a lax vowel.\n    *   Analysis: Similar to `southern`, the word is only two syllables long, but the vowel has laxed upon the addition of the suffix (`-ant`). This is an example of shortening before a consonant cluster (`-nt`). This is part of the same family of phonological processes. Thus, it **has undergone** this type of shortening.\n\n5.  **gratitude**:\n    *   Related word: `grateful` (pronounced /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/). The vowel in the root is the tense diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   Derived word: `gratitude` (pronounced /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/).\n    *   Analysis: The corresponding syllable (`grat-`) is the third from the end (`grat-i-tude`). Its vowel has changed from /eɪ/ to the lax vowel /æ/. This is another example of trisyllabic laxing. Thus, it **has undergone** the process.\n\n6.  **shadow**:\n    *   Related word: `shade` (pronounced /ʃeɪd/). The vowel is the tense diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   Word in question: `shadow` (pronounced /ˈʃædoʊ/). The first vowel is /æ/, a lax vowel.\n    *   Careful Point & Analysis: This *looks* like the same pattern. However, the etymology is different. `shadow` does not come from `shade` + suffix. Both words descend from different grammatical cases of the same Old English word, *sceadu*. The form that became `shadow` (*sceadwe*) already had a short vowel in Old English. The form that became `shade` (*sceadu*) had its vowel lengthen in Middle English because it was in an \"open\" syllable. Therefore, `shadow` did not *undergo* a laxing or shortening process; it simply inherited its short vowel from its ancestor form. It is `shade` that underwent a change (lengthening).\n\n**Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n\nFive of the words (`southern`, `derivative`, `serenity`, `pleasant`, `gratitude`) demonstrate a historical process where a tense vowel in a root was laxed/shortened when the word was derived. `shadow` is the only word where the lax vowel was not the result of such a shortening process; it was inherited from an earlier stage of the language, while its cognate `shade` underwent lengthening. Therefore, `shadow` is the word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing or a similar shortening process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
