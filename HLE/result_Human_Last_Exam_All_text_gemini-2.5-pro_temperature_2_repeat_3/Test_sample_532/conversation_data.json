    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the definitions given in the question.\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S² ∩ S = ∅`, where `S² = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n    *   An important consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in any product-free set `S`, because if `e ∈ S`, then `e * e = e ∈ S`, violating the condition.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (Maximal Product-Free Set):** This is a product-free set `M` such that it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, for any element `g ∈ G \\ M`, the set `M ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group (G):** A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to the entire group. That is, `G = ⋃ M_i`, where the union is over all maximal product-free sets `M_i` in `G`.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. Equivalently, its upper central series terminates at `G`.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points and Key Insights\n\n1.  **The Role of the Identity Element:** As noted, the identity element `e` can never be part of a product-free set in a non-trivial group. Therefore, the union of all maximal product-free sets `⋃ M_i` cannot contain `e`. The definition of a \"filled group\" must be interpreted as the union covering all *non-identity* elements. So, a group `G` is filled if `G \\ {e} = ⋃ M_i`. This means that for every non-identity element `g ∈ G`, there must be at least one maximal product-free set containing `g`.\n\n2.  **A Crucial Characterization:** The determination of all maximal product-free sets for an arbitrary group is a very difficult problem. Fortunately, there is a powerful theorem by B. V. Novikov (2012) that provides a much simpler characterization of filled groups.\n    \n    **Novikov's Theorem:** A finite group `G` is filled if and only if every non-identity element of `G` has order 2 or 3.\n    \n    This theorem transforms a complex combinatorial problem into a straightforward question about the orders of elements in the group. We will proceed by assuming the validity of this published result.\n\n3.  **Properties of Nilpotent Groups:** The key property for our analysis is that a finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow `p`-subgroups. If `|G| = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ... p_k^{a_k}`, then `G ≅ S_{p_1} × S_{p_2} × ... × S_{p_k}`, where `S_{p_i}` is the unique Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G`. The order of an element `g = (g_1, g_2, ..., g_k)` in this direct product is `lcm(ord(g_1), ord(g_2), ..., ord(g_k))`.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe are looking for finite groups `G` that are both **nilpotent** and **filled**. We will use Novikov's theorem on the structure of a nilpotent group.\n\n1.  **Constraining the Prime Divisors of |G|:**\n    Let `G` be a finite filled nilpotent group. By Novikov's theorem, every element `x ∈ G \\ {e}` must have `ord(x) = 2` or `ord(x) = 3`.\n    Since `G` is nilpotent, `G ≅ S_{p_1} × S_{p_2} × ... × S_{p_k}`. Suppose `|G|` is divisible by a prime `p ≥ 5`. Then the Sylow `p`-subgroup `S_p` is non-trivial. By Cauchy's theorem, `S_p` must contain an element `x` of order `p`. This element `x`, considered as an element of `G`, also has order `p`. But `p ≥ 5`, which is not 2 or 3. This contradicts the condition from Novikov's theorem.\n    Therefore, the order of `G` cannot be divisible by any prime greater than or equal to 5. The only possible prime divisors of `|G|` are 2 and 3.\n    This means a finite filled nilpotent group `G` must be of the form `G ≅ S_2 × S_3`, where `S_2` is its Sylow 2-subgroup and `S_3` is its Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Structure of G:**\n    Now we examine the elements of `G ≅ S_2 × S_3`. Let's consider the case where both `S_2` and `S_3` are non-trivial.\n    If `S_2` is non-trivial, it contains an element `x_2` of order 2.\n    If `S_3` is non-trivial, it contains an element `x_3` of order 3.\n    Consider the element `g = (x_2, x_3)` in `G`. Its order is `ord(g) = lcm(ord(x_2), ord(x_3)) = lcm(2, 3) = 6`.\n    An element of order 6 violates the condition that all non-identity elements must have order 2 or 3.\n    Therefore, a filled nilpotent group cannot simultaneously have non-trivial Sylow 2- and Sylow 3-subgroups. This implies that either `S_2` is trivial or `S_3` is trivial.\n\n3.  **Case 1: `S_3` is trivial.**\n    In this case, `G ≅ S_2`, so `G` is a 2-group. For `G` to be filled, every non-identity element must have order 2 or 3. Since `G` is a 2-group, the order of any element must be a power of 2. The only possibility is order 2.\n    So, every element `x` in `G \\ {e}` must satisfy `x^2 = e`. A group where every non-identity element has order 2 is known as an **elementary abelian 2-group**. Such groups are always abelian (hence nilpotent) and are isomorphic to a direct product of copies of `C_2`. So, `G ≅ (C_2)^n` for some integer `n ≥ 0`.\n\n4.  **Case 2: `S_2` is trivial.**\n    In this case, `G ≅ S_3`, so `G` is a 3-group. For `G` to be filled, every non-identity element must have order 2 or 3. Since `G` is a 3-group, the order of any element must be a power of 3. The only possibility is order 3.\n    So, every element `x` in `G \\ {e}` must satisfy `x^3 = e`. This describes a **finite 3-group of exponent 3**. Any finite p-group (including a 3-group) is automatically nilpotent.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining these two cases, we find that a finite group `G` is a filled nilpotent group if and only if it belongs to one of two categories:\n\n1.  `G` is an elementary abelian 2-group (i.e., `G ≅ (C_2)^n` for some `n ≥ 0`).\n2.  `G` is a finite 3-group of exponent 3 (i.e., a group of order `3^k` where `x^3 = e` for all `x ∈ G`).\n\nThe trivial group `{e}` is included in both descriptions (as `(C_2)^0` or as the 3-group of order `3^0`).\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are the elementary abelian 2-groups and the finite 3-groups of exponent 3.>>>"
