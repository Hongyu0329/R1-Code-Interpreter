    "This question requires tracing a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verbal root through its historical developments into Proto-Germanic and several of its daughter languages. The analysis involves applying major sound laws at each stage of the languages' evolution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Stage**\n    *   **Form:** `*seh₂g-iyeti`. The core element is the root `*seh₂g-`.\n    *   **Meaning:** The examples provided (Hittite `sākizzi`, Latin `sāgīre`) indicate a meaning related to 'perceiving keenly, tracking, tracing'.\n    *   **Derivation:** The form given is a `*ye/yo-`present. However, the Germanic forms meaning 'to seek' are best explained as descending from a PIE causative formation, which uses an o-grade of the root and the suffix `*-éye-`. The causative form would be `*soh₂g-éye-ti`.\n    *   **Phonology:** In the causative root `*soh₂g-`, the sequence of a short `*o` vowel followed by the laryngeal `*h₂` develops into a long vowel `*ā` in the pre-Germanic dialect of PIE. So, the root form entering into Germanic is effectively `*sāg-`.\n\n2.  **From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** This fundamental sound shift affects consonants. The PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the Proto-Germanic voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   **Vowel Shift:** PIE long `*ā` becomes long `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   **Combining these changes, the root `*sāg-` becomes `*sōk-` in PGmc.**\n    *   **Verbal Form:** The PIE causative suffix `*-éye-` becomes `*-ija-` in PGmc. Verbs formed with this suffix are Class 1 weak verbs. The infinitive ending in PGmc is `*-aną`.\n    *   **Final PGmc Form:** Combining the root and endings gives **`*sōkijaną`**. The meaning evolved from 'to cause someone to track/perceive' to the more direct meaning of 'to seek, to look for'.\n\n3.  **From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n    *   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`.\n    *   **i-Umlaut:** The `/j/` in the `*-ija-` suffix causes the fronting of the preceding root vowel. In Old Norse, `*ō` is fronted to `œ`, which is often written as `æ`. So, `*sōk-` becomes `sæk-`.\n    *   **Other Changes:** The medial `/j/` is lost after a long/heavy syllable (like `sōk-`), and the infinitive ending is simplified to `-a`.\n    *   **Final ON Form:** **`sækja`** (also spelled `sœkja`).\n\n4.  **From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n    *   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`.\n    *   **i-Umlaut:** The `/j/` also triggers i-umlaut in Old English. Here, `*ō` is fronted and raised to become `ē`. The root becomes `sēc-`.\n    *   **Palatalization:** The velar stop `/k/` was palatalized to a `/tʃ/` sound (as in \"church\") before front vowels like the new `ē`. This sound was written with the letter `c` in Old English.\n    *   **Other Changes:** The medial `/j/` is lost, and the infinitive ending is `*-an`.\n    *   **Final OE Form:** **`sēcan`**.\n\n5.  **From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n    *   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`.\n    *   **High German Consonant Shift:** This is the most significant change. PGmc `*k` shifts to a voiceless fricative `/x/` after a vowel. When the `*k` was geminated (doubled) to `*kk` by the following `/j/`, it shifted to a long fricative, written `hh` or `ch`.\n    *   **Vowel Change:** PGmc `*ō` regularly becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   **i-Umlaut:** The `/j/` can optionally cause i-umlaut of the `uo` to `üe`, but the un-umlauted form is very common and representative.\n    *   **Infinitive Ending:** The infinitive ending is `-(e)n` or `-(a)n`.\n    *   **Final OHG Form:** Combining the consonant shift (`k` > `hh`) and the vowel change (`ō` > `uo`) gives **`suohhen`** (alternative spellings include `suohhan`, `suochen`).\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sækja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sækja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
