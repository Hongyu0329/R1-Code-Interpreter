    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of homology cobordism group elements that can be represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$):** This is the set of oriented integral homology 3-spheres modulo an equivalence relation. Two such spheres, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are considered equivalent (homology cobordant) if the manifold $Y_1 \\cup (-Y_2)$ is the boundary of an integral homology 4-ball. The group operation is the connected sum (#). The identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This refers to Dehn surgery on a knot $K$ in $S^3$ with a framing of +1 or -1. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_{+1}(K)$ or $S^3_{-1}(K)$. These manifolds are integral homology spheres.\n3.  **Knots with at most four crossings:** We need to identify all prime knots with crossing number $c \\le 4$. These are:\n    *   $c=0$: The unknot, $0_1$.\n    *   $c=3$: The right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$ or $3_1^*$).\n    *   $c=4$: The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphicheiral, meaning it is equivalent to its own mirror image.\n\nOur goal is to find the size of the set of distinct elements in $\\Theta_3^H$ represented by the manifolds $\\{ S^3_{\\pm 1}(K) \\}$ for $K$ in the list $\\{0_1, 3_1, -3_1, 4_1\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Surgeries on Each Knot\nTo distinguish elements in the homology cobordism group, we can use homology cobordism invariants. The Casson invariant, $\\lambda$, is a powerful such invariant for integral homology spheres. It is a homomorphism $\\lambda: \\Theta_3^H \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. If two manifolds have different Casson invariants, they represent different elements in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\nA key formula connects the Casson invariant of a surgery to the Alexander polynomial of the knot. For an integral surgery with framing $p = \\pm 1$ on a knot $K$, the Casson invariant is given by:\n$\\lambda(S^3_p(K)) = p \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta_K''(1)}{2}$\nwhere $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of $K$, normalized to be symmetric ($\\Delta_K(t) = \\Delta_K(t^{-1})$) and satisfy $\\Delta_K(1) = 1$.\n\n#### A. Surgery on the Unknot ($0_1$)\n*   Integral surgery on the unknot produces the 3-sphere $S^3$.\n*   $S^3_{\\pm 1}(0_1) = S^3$.\n*   $S^3$ is the identity element of the group $\\Theta_3^H$. Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(S^3) = 0$.\n*   This gives us **one element**: the identity.\n\n#### B. Surgery on the Trefoil Knot ($3_1$ and its mirror $-3_1$)\n*   The Alexander polynomial for the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) is $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1}$.\n*   The first derivative is $\\Delta'_{3_1}(t) = 1 - t^{-2}$.\n*   The second derivative is $\\Delta''_{3_1}(t) = 2t^{-3}$.\n*   Evaluating at $t=1$, we get $\\Delta''_{3_1}(1) = 2$.\n*   For $+1$ surgery on $3_1$: $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(3_1)) = +1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = 1$.\n*   For $-1$ surgery on $3_1$: $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = -1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = -1$.\n*   The left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$) has the same Alexander polynomial, so the results are identical: $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(-3_1))=1$ and $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(-3_1))=-1$.\n*   These surgeries produce elements with Casson invariants 1 and -1. Since these are non-zero, they are distinct from the identity. Since $1 \\neq -1$, they are also distinct from each other.\n*   This gives us **two new elements**.\n\n#### C. Surgery on the Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)\n*   The Alexander polynomial for the figure-eight knot ($4_1$) is $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = -t + 3 - t^{-1}$.\n*   The first derivative is $\\Delta'_{4_1}(t) = -1 + t^{-2}$.\n*   The second derivative is $\\Delta''_{4_1}(t) = -2t^{-3}$.\n*   Evaluating at $t=1$, we get $\\Delta''_{4_1}(1) = -2$.\n*   For $+1$ surgery on $4_1$: $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = +1 \\cdot \\frac{-2}{2} = -1$.\n*   For $-1$ surgery on $4_1$: $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = -1 \\cdot \\frac{-2}{2} = 1$.\n*   The Casson invariants are 1 and -1. These are the same values we obtained from the trefoil knot.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Distinct Elements\nLet's collect all the Casson invariant values we have found for the resulting manifolds:\n*   From the unknot: {0}\n*   From the trefoils: {1, -1}\n*   From the figure-eight knot: {1, -1}\n\nThe set of all possible Casson invariants for these surgeries is $\\{0, 1, -1\\}$. Since the Casson invariant distinguishes homology cobordism classes, these three distinct values correspond to three distinct elements in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\nA theorem by Fintushel and Stern states that any integral homology sphere with Casson invariant $\\lambda = \\pm 1$ is homology cobordant to $S^3_{\\pm 1}(-3_1)$ (i.e., $\\pm 1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil). This confirms that all the manifolds we found with $\\lambda=1$ belong to a single homology cobordism class, and similarly for all manifolds with $\\lambda=-1$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct elements is the number of distinct Casson invariant values we found.\n\n1.  The identity element, with $\\lambda = 0$.\n2.  An element with $\\lambda = 1$.\n3.  An element with $\\lambda = -1$.\n\nThere are exactly three such elements."
