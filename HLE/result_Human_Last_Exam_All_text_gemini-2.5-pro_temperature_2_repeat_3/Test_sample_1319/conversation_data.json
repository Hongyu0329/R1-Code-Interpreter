    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The goal is to find the tallest *historical* (i.e., real geographical) mountain that is mentioned by name in the text of Homer's *Iliad*, with the specific exclusion of Mount Olympus, which is the tallest.\n\n2.  **Identify Mountain Candidates from the *Iliad***: We must search the epic for mentions of specific mountains. The primary candidates are:\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods and the tallest mountain in Greece. This is mentioned frequently but is explicitly excluded by the question. (Elevation: 2,918 m / 9,573 ft)\n    *   **Mount Ida:** A crucial mountain near Troy. Zeus sits on its highest peak, Gargarus, to watch the Trojan War unfold. This is the Mount Ida in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), not the one on Crete. (Mentioned in Book 8, 14, etc.)\n    *   **Mount Samothrace:** The *Iliad* states that the god Poseidon watches the battle from the \"topmost peak of wooded Samothrace,\" an island in the northern Aegean Sea located between Greece and Troy. The peak is now called Mount Fengari or Saos. (Mentioned in Book 13).\n    *   **Mount Athos:** During her journey to trick Zeus in Book 14, the goddess Hera flies from Olympus \"over the snowy mountains of the Thracian horsemen,\" and \"came to Athos, and from Athos to the surging sea.\" This places Mount Athos directly in her path. (Mentioned in Book 14).\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** Located in Thessaly, Greece, it is famous in mythology as the home of the centaur Chiron. In the *Iliad*, Achilles's formidable spear is explicitly said to be from an ash tree that grew on the peak of Pelion. (Mentioned in Book 16 and 19).\n\n3.  **Gather the Elevations of the Candidate Mountains:** Now we must find the heights of these historical mountains to compare them.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n    *   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı in modern Turkey):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n    *   **Mount Pelion (highest peak, Pourianos Stavros):** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n    *   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n4.  **Compare and Rank the Candidates:** Ordering the mountains by elevation from tallest to shortest (excluding Olympus):\n    1.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n    2.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n    3.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n    4.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the ranking, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus is Mount Athos.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing between historical and purely mythical locations:** All the mountains listed are real, geographical features.\n*   **Confirming the mention is within the *Iliad***: One must be careful not to confuse mentions in the *Iliad* with those in the *Odyssey* or other myths (e.g., the Gigantes piling Pelion on Ossa is from the *Gigantomachy*, not the *Iliad*). All candidates listed here are confirmed to be in the *Iliad*.\n*   **Identifying the correct \"Mount Ida\":** Greek mythology features two famous mountains named Ida. The one in the *Iliad* is near Troy, in modern-day Turkey, not the one on Crete associated with Zeus's birth.\n*   **Accuracy of elevations:** Using reliable, modern elevation data is key to making the correct comparison.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nAfter identifying all the mountains explicitly named in the *Iliad* (Olympus, Ida, Samothrace, Athos, Pelion) and excluding the tallest (Olympus), a direct comparison of the remaining mountains' elevations shows that Mount Athos (2,033 m) is taller than Mount Ida (1,774 m), Mount Pelion (1,624 m), and Mount Samothrace (1,611 m).\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
