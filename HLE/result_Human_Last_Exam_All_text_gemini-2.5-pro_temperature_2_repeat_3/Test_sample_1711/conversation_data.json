    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Group G and its Cyclic Subgroups\n\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group.\nThe order of any element $g \\in G$ must divide the exponent of the group, which is 49. The possible orders of elements are 1, 7, and 49.\nConsequently, the cyclic subgroups of $G$ can have orders 1, 7, or 49.\n\n*   **Order 1:** The only cyclic subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$, generated by the identity element $0 \\in G$.\n*   **Order 7:** These are subgroups of the form $\\langle g \\rangle$ where $g \\in G$ has order 7. An element $g$ has order 7 if $g \\neq 0$ and $7g = 0$.\n*   **Order 49:** These are subgroups of the form $\\langle g \\rangle$ where $g \\in G$ has order 49.\n\nWe are looking for the smallest set $A \\subset G$ such that for any $g \\in G$, the intersection $A \\cap \\langle g \\rangle$ is non-empty.\n\n### Step 2: Reducing the Problem by Analyzing Subgroup Structure\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between the cyclic subgroups.\nAny cyclic subgroup of order 49, say $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ where $|g|=49$, contains a unique subgroup of order 7. This subgroup is $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$, since $7(7g)=49g=0$ and $7g \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's call the set of all cyclic subgroups of $G$ as $\\mathcal{S}$. We need to find the smallest set $A$ that \"hits\" every subgroup in $\\mathcal{S}$.\nLet's see if we can simplify this condition. A set $A$ must satisfy:\n1.  $A \\cap \\{0\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, which means $0 \\in A$.\n2.  For any cyclic subgroup $H_7$ of order 7, $A \\cap H_7 \\neq \\emptyset$.\n3.  For any cyclic subgroup $H_{49}$ of order 49, $A \\cap H_{49} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nLet's build a set $A$ that satisfies conditions 1 and 2. Let's see if it automatically satisfies condition 3.\nAssume $0 \\in A$, and for every cyclic subgroup $H_7$ of order 7, $A \\cap H_7 \\neq \\emptyset$.\nNow, consider any cyclic subgroup $H_{49}$ of order 49. As we established, $H_{49}$ contains a unique subgroup $H_7$ of order 7. By our assumption on $A$, there exists some element $a \\in A \\cap H_7$. Since $H_7 \\subset H_{49}$, this element $a$ is also in $H_{49}$. Thus, $A \\cap H_{49} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nThis means the problem is reduced to finding the smallest set $A$ that contains 0 and intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\nLet $A = \\{0\\} \\cup A'$, where $A'$ is a set of non-zero elements. The condition on $A'$ is that it must intersect every cyclic subgroup of order 7. The total size will be $|A| = 1 + |A'|$.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7\n\nThe problem is now to find the minimum size for $A'$. The elements of $A'$ will be used to \"hit\" the cyclic subgroups of order 7.\nA cyclic subgroup of order 7 is generated by an element of order 7. Let's find the structure of all elements of order dividing 7. This is the subgroup $G[7] = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g = 0\\}$.\nFor an element $g = (g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$, the condition $7g=0$ means $7g_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the solutions to $7x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ are the multiples of 7: $x \\in \\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$. This set forms a subgroup $\\langle 7 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $G[7] = (\\langle 7 \\rangle)^{2024} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\nThis means $G[7]$ can be viewed as a vector space, let's call it $V$, of dimension $d=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\nA cyclic subgroup of order 7 is generated by a non-zero element of $V$. Such a subgroup has the form $\\{0, v, 2v, \\dots, 6v\\}$ for some $v \\in V \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This is precisely a 1-dimensional subspace of $V$.\nSo, the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is equal to the number of 1-dimensional subspaces of $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$.\n\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in a $d$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^d - 1}{q - 1}$.\nIn our case, $q=7$ and $d=2024$. So the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n$N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Minimum Size of the Hitting Set\n\nWe need to find the minimum size of $A' \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of order 7. Let $\\mathcal{H}_7$ be the set of these subgroups.\nLet $H_1, H_2$ be two distinct subgroups from $\\mathcal{H}_7$. In our vector space analogy, they are two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Their intersection is just the zero vector: $H_1 \\cap H_2 = \\{0\\}$.\nLet $A'$ be the required hitting set. For each $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_7$, there must be some element $a_H \\in A' \\cap H$. Since $A'$ contains only non-zero elements, $a_H \\in H \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nConsider two distinct subgroups $H_1, H_2 \\in \\mathcal{H}_7$. They require hitting elements $a_{H_1} \\in A' \\cap H_1$ and $a_{H_2} \\in A' \\cap H_2$.\nSince $a_{H_1} \\in H_1 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ and $a_{H_2} \\in H_2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, and $H_1 \\cap H_2 = \\{0\\}$, it must be that $a_{H_1} \\neq a_{H_2}$.\nThis implies that each subgroup in $\\mathcal{H}_7$ must be hit by a unique element of $A'$. Therefore, the size of $A'$ must be at least the number of these subgroups.\n$|A'| \\ge |\\mathcal{H}_7| = N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\nThis minimum size is achievable: we can construct such a set $A'$ by choosing exactly one non-zero element from each cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Answer\n\nThe minimum size of $A'$ is $N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\nThe minimum size of the full set $A$ is $|A'| + 1$ (for the zero element).\nSo, the minimum size of $A$ is:\n$|A| = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} + 1 = \\frac{7^{2024}-1+6}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024}+5}{6}$.\nThis is an integer, since $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$. Thus, $7^{2024}+5 \\equiv 1+5 \\equiv 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$."
