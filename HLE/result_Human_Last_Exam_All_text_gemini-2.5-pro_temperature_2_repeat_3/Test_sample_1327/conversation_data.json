    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given sequence**\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Look for a primary relationship between consecutive terms**\nLet's examine the relationship between each term `a(n)` and the previous term `a(n-1)`. The numbers are growing, so let's try a combination of multiplication and addition/subtraction. Since each number is a little more than double the previous one, let's try a rule of the form `a(n) = 2 * a(n-1) + some_value`.\n\n*   From 2 to 11: `2 * 2 + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11`\n*   From 11 to 23: `2 * 11 + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23`\n*   From 23 to 51: `2 * 23 + 5 = 46 + 5 = 51`\n*   From 51 to 119: `2 * 51 + 17 = 102 + 17 = 119`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the pattern in the added values**\nFrom the analysis in Step 2, we have a main rule `a(n) = 2 * a(n-1) + C`, where C is a sequence of numbers we add at each step.\nThe sequence of added numbers (let's call it sequence C) is: {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}.\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern within the sequence C**\nLet's analyze the sequence C = {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}. In sequence problems, it's common for a pattern to establish itself after the first term. Let's ignore the first term (7) for a moment and look at the subsequence {1, 5, 17, ...}.\n\n*   From 1 to 5: A possible rule is multiplying by 3 and adding 2. `1 * 3 + 2 = 5`.\n*   From 5 to 17: Let's test the same rule. `5 * 3 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17`.\n\nThe rule holds. The pattern for the subsequence {1, 5, 17, ...} is: `Next term = (Previous term) * 3 + 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the next term in sequence C**\nUsing the rule we just found, we can calculate the next term after 17.\nNext term = `17 * 3 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53`.\nSo, the next number to be added in our main sequence calculation is 53.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence**\nWe apply the main rule from Step 2 to find the number in the parentheses. The last known term is 119, and the next number to add is 53.\nMissing term = `2 * 119 + 53`\nMissing term = `238 + 53`\nMissing term = `291`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe pattern is that each term is twice the previous term plus a number. That added number itself follows a pattern (`next = previous * 3 + 2`) starting from the third term of the original sequence. The missing number in the sequence is 291.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA. 291\nB. 285\nC. 171\nD. 167\nOur calculated answer matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
