    "Answering this question involves several steps of logical deduction and ultimately a calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Definitions:**\n    *   **Poset:** A partially ordered set. Here, the set is the integers from 1 to `N = 823564528378596`, and the order relation is divisibility (`a ≤ b` if `a` divides `b`).\n    *   **Antichain:** A subset of the poset where no two distinct elements are related. In this case, it's a set of integers where no integer divides another. For example, the set of all prime numbers is an antichain.\n    *   **Union of k antichains:** A set that can be expressed as the union of `k` antichains. This is equivalent to saying the set can be partitioned into at most `k` antichains.\n\n2.  **Applying the Dual of Dilworth's Theorem (Mirsky's Theorem):**\n    Mirsky's Theorem states that for any finite poset, the minimum number of antichains needed to partition the poset is equal to the length of the longest chain in the poset.\n    This theorem can be generalized to subsets: a set `S` can be partitioned into `k` antichains if and only if the longest chain in `S` has a length of at most `k`.\n\n3.  **Reframing the Problem:**\n    The question asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains. Based on the theorem above, this is equivalent to finding the size of the largest subset `S` of `[1, N]` that does not contain a chain of length 21. A chain of length 21 is a sequence of integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_{21}` such that `x_1 | x_2 | ... | x_{21}` and all `x_i` are distinct.\n\n4.  **Constructing a Solution Set:**\n    To find the largest such set `S`, we can analyze the structure of chains in the divisor poset. Any integer `n` can be uniquely written as `n = m * 2^k`, where `m` is an odd number and `k ≥ 0`.\n    Let's consider partitioning the entire set `[1, N]` based on the odd part `m`. For each odd number `m`, define a set `C_m = {m * 2^0, m * 2^1, m * 2^2, ...}` containing all numbers in `[1, N]` with odd part `m`. Each `C_m` is a chain under divisibility (e.g., `m | 2m | 4m ...`).\n\n5.  **Finding an Upper Bound:**\n    Let `S` be any set in `[1, N]` with no chain of length 21. For any odd `m`, the intersection `S \\cap C_m` must have a length of at most 20 (since `C_m` is a chain). Thus, `|S \\cap C_m| ≤ 20`.\n    The total size of `S` is the sum over all odd `m` of the sizes of these intersections:\n    `|S| = \\sum_{m \\text{ odd}} |S \\cap C_m|`.\n    To maximize `|S|`, we should try to make each `|S \\cap C_m|` as large as possible. The maximum possible size for `|S \\cap C_m|` is `min(20, |C_m|)`.\n    This gives an upper bound for the size of `S`:\n    `|S| \\le \\sum_{m \\text{ odd}, m \\le N} \\min(20, |C_m|)`.\n    where `|C_m|` is the number of elements in the chain for `m`, which is `\\lfloor\\log_2(N/m)\\rfloor + 1`.\n\n6.  **Verifying the Construction:**\n    Let's construct a set `S^*` by taking for each odd `m` the `min(20, |C_m|)` largest elements from `C_m`. The size of this set `S^*` is exactly the upper bound we derived. It can be proven that this set `S^*` does not contain a chain of length 21. Therefore, `S^*` is the largest such set.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Final Size:**\n    The size of `S^*` is `\\sum_{m \\text{ odd}, m \\le N} \\min(20, \\lfloor \\log_2(N/m) \\rfloor + 1)`.\n    This sum can be cleverly rewritten by changing the order of summation. The term `\\min(20, ...)` is at least `j` if and only if `\\lfloor \\log_2(N/m) \\rfloor + 1 \\ge j`. This is equivalent to `\\log_2(N/m) \\ge j-1`, which simplifies to `m \\le N / 2^{j-1}`.\n    So, the total size is:\n    `|S^*| = \\sum_{j=1}^{20} |\\{m \\text{ is odd} : m \\le N / 2^{j-1}\\}|`\n    The number of odd integers less than or equal to `X` is given by `\\lfloor (\\lfloor X \\rfloor + 1) / 2 \\rfloor`. Let's denote this `OC(X)`.\n    The answer is `\\sum_{j=1}^{20} OC(N / 2^{j-1}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{19} OC(N / 2^k)`.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    `N = 823564528378596`. We need to compute the sum:\n    *   `k=0`: `OC(N) = OC(823564528378596) = 411782264189298`\n    *   `k=1`: `OC(N/2) = OC(411782264189298) = 205891132094649`\n    *   `k=2`: `OC(N/4) = OC(205891132094649) = 102945566047325`\n    *   `k=3`: `OC(N/8) = OC(102945566047324) = 51472783023662`\n    *   `k=4`: `OC(N/16) = OC(51472783023662) = 25736391511831`\n    *   ...and so on, up to `k=19`.\n    Summing these 20 values:\n      `411782264189298`\n    + `205891132094649`\n    + `102945566047325`\n    + `51472783023662`\n    + `25736391511831`\n    + `12868195755916`\n    + `6434097877958`\n    + `3217048938979`\n    + `1608524469489`\n    + `804262234745`\n    + `402131117372`\n    + `201065558686`\n    + `100532779343`\n    + `50266389672`\n    + `25133194836`\n    + `12566597418`\n    + `6283298709`\n    + `3141649354`\n    + `1570824677`\n    + `785412000`\n    -------------------\n    `= 823563742967584`\n\nThe largest union of 20 antichains is the size of the largest subset of `[1, N]` that contains no chain of length 21. The calculation shows this size to be 823563742967584."
