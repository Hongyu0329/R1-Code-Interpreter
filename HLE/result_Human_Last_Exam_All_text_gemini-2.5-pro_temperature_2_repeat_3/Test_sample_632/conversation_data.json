    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Landmark:** Pantheon church is located here.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** Removed by the city administration.\n*   **Date:** \"until 1950\". This is a key detail to verify.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nThe most famous architectural feature ever added to and later removed from the Pantheon is the pair of bell towers. Let's analyze this candidate against the question's criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Twin Bell Towers\" Candidate**\n*   **What were they?** Two bell towers, one on each side of the Pantheon's main pediment, were added to the ancient structure.\n*   **Were they \"unique\"?** Yes. They were a Baroque addition to a classical Roman temple, a combination that was highly debated and visually distinct. They dramatically changed the iconic silhouette of the Pantheon.\n*   **Who added them?** They were constructed in the 17th century. While often attributed to the famous architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, some historical sources suggest they were designed by his contemporary, Carlo Maderno. Regardless, they are a product of the Baroque era's effort to convert the Pantheon into a Christian church.\n*   **Why were they removed?** The towers were deeply unpopular with art critics and the Roman public almost from the moment they were built. They were widely considered ugly and unfitting for the classical harmony of the Pantheon. They earned the derogatory nickname **\"le orecchie d'asino\"** (the donkey's ears). They were removed as part of an effort in the late 19th century to restore the Pantheon to its perceived original classical appearance.\n*   **Were they removed by the administration?** Yes, their removal was an official act, ordered by the Italian Minister of Public Education, Guido Baccelli.\n\n**Step 4: Scrutinize the Date (A Careful Point)**\n*   The question states the feature was removed in 1950.\n*   Historical records show that the twin bell towers, \"the donkey's ears,\" were demolished much earlier, between **1883 and 1893**.\n*   This is a significant discrepancy. There is no major, well-documented architectural feature that was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda or the Pantheon itself in or around 1950.\n*   The removal of the towers was the single most significant architectural subtraction from the Pantheon in modern history.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nDespite the incorrect date provided in the question, all other details point unequivocally to the twin bell towers. It is overwhelmingly likely that the question refers to this feature but contains a factual error regarding the year of removal. No other feature fits the description of a \"unique architectural feature\" that was removed by the administration.\n\n**Final Analysis Summary**\n*   **The Feature:** The twin bell towers added to the Pantheon in the 17th century.\n*   **Nickname:** Famously and derisively known as \"the donkey's ears.\"\n*   **Reason for Removal:** They were considered an unsightly Baroque addition to the pure classical structure.\n*   **Correction on Date:** The removal happened between 1883-1893, not in 1950 as stated in the question.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is the bell towers.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers, popularly known as \"the donkey's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino)."
