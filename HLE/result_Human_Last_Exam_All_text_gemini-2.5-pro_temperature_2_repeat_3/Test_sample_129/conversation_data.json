    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols: `T F ! & | ( )`.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n-   **Allowed Symbols:** `T` (True literal), `F` (False literal), `!` (NOT operator), `&` (AND operator), `|` (OR operator), `(` (left parenthesis), `)` (right parenthesis).\n-   **Expression Length:** Must be exactly 5 symbols.\n-   **Symbol Repetition:** Allowed.\n-   **Operator Precedence:** The standard order is `!` > `&` > `|`.\n-   **Goal:** Count the number of unique, syntactically valid strings of 5 symbols that evaluate to `True`.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy - Enumerating Syntactic Skeletons\nThe most reliable way to solve this is to identify all possible valid structures (skeletons) an expression of length 5 can have. A skeleton is a template showing the arrangement of symbol types (Variable, Operator, Parenthesis). We will use `V` for a variable (`T` or `F`), `op` for a binary operator (`&` or `|`), `!` for NOT, and `(`, `)` for parentheses.\n\nAfter listing all possible 5-symbol skeletons, we will count how many expressions of each type evaluate to `True`.\n\n### Step 3: Finding and Analyzing All Skeletons of Length 5\n\nWe can systematically find all skeletons by considering what the first symbol can be (`V`, `!`, or `(`).\n\n---\n\n#### Case A: Skeletons without Parentheses\n\n1.  **`V op V op V`** (e.g., `T&F|T`)\n    This skeleton uses 5 symbols. We need to consider all combinations of variables and operators. There are `2*2*2 = 8` ways to choose the three variables and `2*2 = 4` ways to choose the two operators. Due to precedence, we have four sub-cases based on the operators:\n    *   **`V & V & V`**: Parsed as `(V&V)&V`. This is true only if all three variables are `T`.\n        *   True expressions: `T&T&T`. (Count: **1**)\n    *   **`V | V | V`**: Parsed as `(V|V)|V`. This is true if at least one variable is `T`. It's false only if all are `F`. So, `2^3 - 1 = 7` combinations are true.\n        *   True expressions: (Count: **7**)\n    *   **`V & V | V`**: Parsed as `(V&V)|V`. This is true if `V3` is `T` (4 combinations for V1, V2), or if `V1=T, V2=T` and `V3=F` (1 combination).\n        *   True expressions: (Count: **5**)\n    *   **`V | V & V`**: Parsed as `V|(V&V)`. This is true if `V1` is `T` (4 combinations for V2, V3), or if `V1=F` and `V2=T, V3=T` (1 combination).\n        *   True expressions: (Count: **5**)\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18`.\n\n2.  **`!!V op V`** (e.g., `!!T&F`)\n    This uses 5 symbols (`!`,`!`,`V`,`op`,`V`). It is parsed as `(!!V) op V`, which is logically equivalent to `V op V`.\n    *   `op` is `&`: `V&V` is true only for `T&T`. (Count: **1**)\n    *   `op` is `|`: `V|V` is true for `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. (Count: **3**)\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\n3.  **`V op !!V`** (e.g., `T|!!F`)\n    Symmetrical to the case above. Logically equivalent to `V op V`.\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `4`.\n\n4.  **`!V op !V`** (e.g., `!T|!F`)\n    Parsed as `(!V) op (!V)`.\n    *   `op` is `&`: `!V & !V` is true only for `!F & !F`. (Count: **1**)\n    *   `op` is `|`: `!V | !V` is false only for `!T | !T`. So 3 combinations are true. (Count: **3**)\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `4`.\n\n5.  **`!!!!V`** (e.g., `!!!!T`)\n    This uses 5 symbols. `!!!!V` is logically equivalent to `V`.\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`. (Count: **1**)\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates to `F`.\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `1`.\n\n---\n\n#### Case B: Skeletons with Parentheses\n\n6.  **`(V op V)`** (e.g., `(T&F)`)\n    This uses 5 symbols (`(`,`V`,`op`,`V`,`)`).\n    *   `op` is `&`: `(V&V)` is true only for `(T&T)`. (Count: **1**)\n    *   `op` is `|`: `(V|V)` is true for `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. (Count: **3**)\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `4`.\n\n7.  **`((V))`** (e.g., `((T))`)\n    This uses 5 symbols. Logically equivalent to `V`.\n    *   `((T))` evaluates to `T`. (Count: **1**)\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `1`.\n\n8.  **`(!!V)`** (e.g., `(!!F)`)\n    This uses 5 symbols. Logically equivalent to `V`.\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `T`. (Count: **1**)\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `1`.\n\n9.  **`!(!V)`** (e.g., `!(!T)`)\n    The string of symbols is `!,(,!,V,)`. This is 5 symbols. It is parsed as `!(!V)`, which is logically equivalent to `V`.\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `T`. (Count: **1**)\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `1`.\n\n10. **`(V) op V`** (e.g., `(T)|F`)\n    This uses 5 symbols. It is logically equivalent to `V op V`.\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `4`. (Same count as `!!V op V`).\n\n11. **`V op (V)`** (e.g., `T&(F)`)\n    Symmetrical to the case above. Logically equivalent to `V op V`.\n    *   Total for this skeleton: `4`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nThe skeletons identified represent distinct sets of expression strings. We can sum the number of true expressions from each case.\n\n*   From `V op V op V`: **18**\n*   From `!!V op V`: **4**\n*   From `V op !!V`: **4**\n*   From `!V op !V`: **4**\n*   From `!!!!V`: **1**\n*   From `(V op V)`: **4**\n*   From `((V))`: **1**\n*   From `(!!V)`: **1**\n*   From `!(!V)`: **1**\n*   From `(V) op V`: **4**\n*   From `V op (V)`: **4**\n\nTotal Count = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = **46**\n\n<<<46>>>"
