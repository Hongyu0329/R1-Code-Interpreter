    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for the number of depressions contained *within* the lacrimal recess of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*.\n2.  **Identify the Subject:** The subject is a specific dinosaur, *Irritator challengeri*, a member of the Spinosauridae family.\n3.  **Identify the Anatomical Feature:** The feature is the \"lacrimal recess.\" In vertebrate anatomy, a recess is a cavity or depression. The lacrimal is a bone in the skull that forms part of the margin of the eye socket. The question concerns features located inside this specific depression.\n4.  **Consult Scientific Sources:** To find this specific anatomical detail, it is necessary to refer to the primary scientific literature that describes the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The most comprehensive description of its cranial anatomy is found in the 2002 paper \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David Martill, and Diane Scott. This paper is based on the holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022).\n5.  **Extract the Relevant Information:** In their detailed description of the lacrimal bone, Sues et al. (2002) describe the lacrimal recess as a large, deep depression. Crucially, they state what this recess contains. Their paper specifies: \"This recess encloses **three** pneumatic openings...\"\n6.  **Detail the Depressions:** The paper further identifies these three features within the lacrimal recess:\n    *   A large lacrimal fenestra (an opening).\n    *   A smaller, circular pneumatic foramen (a small opening for nerves or blood vessels, in this case related to air sacs).\n    *   An even smaller pneumatic foramen.\n7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the authoritative description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, the lacrimal recess itself is a single large depression that contains three smaller depressions in the form of pneumatic openings (one fenestra and two foramina). Therefore, the number of depressions contained within the lacrimal recess is three.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Source of Information:** It is critical to rely on the primary scientific description of the fossil specimen rather than general dinosaur information, as anatomical details can be highly specific to a genus or species.\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The wording \"does the lacrimal recess ... contain\" is key. It indicates that we should count the features *inside* the main recess, not the recess itself.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** A fenestra and a foramen are types of openings or holes in bone, which anatomically count as depressions within a larger surface or recess.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the primary scientific literature describing the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull, the lacrimal recess contains three distinct depressions.\n\n<<<3>>>"
