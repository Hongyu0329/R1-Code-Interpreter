    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the derivation of the most memory-efficient C program's variable memory usage.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe problem asks us to take a string representing a sum of numbers (e.g., \"3+2+1\") and reorder the numbers so they are in non-decreasing (sorted) order. The resulting string should be printed.\n\n*   **Input:** A non-empty string `s` of at most 1000 characters. The string consists only of the digits '1', '2', '3' and the '+' character. It represents a valid mathematical sum.\n*   **Output:** A string representing the same sum, but with the numbers rearranged in non-decreasing order, separated by '+'.\n*   **Example:** For an input of `3+2+1`, the numbers are 3, 2, and 1. The sorted sequence of numbers is 1, 2, 3. The output should be `1+2+3`.\n*   **Core Task:** The essence of the problem is to extract the numbers from the input string, sort them, and then reconstruct the sum string.\n*   **Constraint:** The main goal is to find a solution that is \"most memory-efficient\". This means we must minimize the total bytes used by all variables in the program.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n1.  **Data Representation:** The numbers we need to sort are single characters ('1', '2', '3') located at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in the input string `s`. The '+' signs are at odd indices and serve as separators.\n\n2.  **Memory Efficiency:** The crucial part of the request is to minimize memory usage. A common approach might be to create a new integer array, store the numbers, sort it, and then build the output. However, this would require an auxiliary array whose size depends on the input length. A more memory-efficient solution would avoid creating such a large data structure.\n\n3.  **Choosing a Sorting Strategy:**\n    *   **Counting Sort:** Since the numbers are limited to a very small range (1, 2, 3), we could simply count the occurrences of each number. This requires a few integer variables (e.g., `count1`, `count2`, `count3`). This is very fast (linear time complexity) and uses a small, fixed amount of extra memory for the counters.\n    *   **In-place Sort:** An even more memory-frugal approach is to perform the sort directly on the input character array `s`. We can apply a simple sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort, but only to the characters at the even indices. This modifies the input string buffer `s` to become the output string, eliminating the need for any other arrays to hold the numbers.\n\n4.  **Comparing Strategies:**\n    *   The **Counting Sort** approach requires an array or several integers to store the counts, plus loop variables and potentially a flag for printing the '+' separators correctly.\n    *   The **In-place Sort** approach only requires loop variables and a single temporary character for swapping. By directly comparing the two, the in-place sort uses slightly less memory as it doesn't need dedicated counters. Given the goal is maximum memory efficiency, the in-place sort is the superior choice.\n\n### Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will design the solution using the **In-place Sort** method, as it is the most memory-efficient. A simple selection sort algorithm will be used.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **Declare Variables:** We declare a character array `s` to hold the input string, two integer loop counters `i` and `j`, and one character `temp` for swapping.\n2.  **Read Input:** The program reads the input string into the `s` array.\n3.  **In-place Selection Sort:** We iterate through the numbers in the string and sort them.\n    *   An outer loop runs with index `i` from 0 to the end of the string, incrementing by 2 at each step (`i = 0, 2, 4, ...`). The character `s[i]` is the current element we want to place correctly.\n    *   An inner loop runs with index `j` from `i + 2` to the end of the string, also incrementing by 2 (`j = i+2, i+4, ...`). This loop finds the smallest number in the remainder of the list.\n    *   If `s[j]` is less than `s[i]`, we swap the two characters using the `temp` variable.\n4.  **Print Output:** After the sorting loops are finished, the string `s` itself contains the numbers in sorted order, with the '+' signs undisturbed. The program simply prints the modified string `s`.\n\n**Calculating Total Memory Usage (m):**\nLet's assume a standard 32-bit architecture where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n*   **Input String Buffer `s`**: The string length is at most 1000. In C, we need to account for the null terminator (`\\0`). So, we declare `char s[1001];`.\n    *   Memory = `1001 * sizeof(char)` = `1001 * 1` = **1001 bytes**.\n*   **Loop Counters `i, j`**: We need two integer variables for our nested loops in the selection sort.\n    *   Memory = `2 * sizeof(int)` = `2 * 4` = **8 bytes**.\n*   **Temporary Swap Variable `temp`**: A single character variable is needed to perform swaps.\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(char)` = `1 * 1` = **1 byte**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nThe total memory is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\nm = (memory for `s`) + (memory for `i, j`) + (memory for `temp`)\nm = 1001 + 8 + 1\nm = 1010 bytes\n\nThis is the most memory-efficient implementation, as it reuses the input buffer for the output and only requires a few extra bytes for control variables.\n\n<<<1010>>>"
