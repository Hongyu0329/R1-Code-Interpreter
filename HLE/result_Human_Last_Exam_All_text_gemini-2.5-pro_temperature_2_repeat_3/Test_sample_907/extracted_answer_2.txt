a) **No interaction between molecules:**
The absorption cross-section is the sum of contributions from N independent molecules, resulting in:
$\sigma(\omega_0) = N \frac{2\sqrt{\pi} \omega_{eg} \tau}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 e^{-(\omega_{eg}-\omega_0)^2 \tau^2}$

b) **Near-neighbor interaction considered:**
The interaction creates collective exciton states, but a selection rule allows transitions only to the $k=0$ exciton. The cross-section is for this single transition:
$\sigma(\omega_0) = N \frac{2\sqrt{\pi} \omega_{ex} \tau}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 e^{-(\omega_{ex}-\omega_0)^2 \tau^2}$
where the exciton transition frequency is shifted by the interaction: $\omega_{ex} = \omega_{eg} + 2J/\hbar$.
