  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Information Source and the Message Alphabet**\n*   **Information Source (Ciphertext):** The Ching book contains the encrypted data. It has a total of 9999 symbols. These symbols are the building blocks of the encrypted message.\n*   **Message Alphabet (Plaintext):** The secret message is written using a specific set of characters. The problem states this is a set of \"120 most common Chinese characters\". This means our alphabet for the unencrypted message has 120 unique characters.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Number of Unique Symbols in the Ching**\n*   The symbols in the Ching are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n*   \"Yinyang\" has two possibilities: yin or yang.\n*   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements/Phases) has five possibilities: water, fire, wood, metal, or earth.\n*   To find the total number of unique symbol types, we multiply the possibilities for each part: 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must correctly interpret \"yinyang-wuxing\" as a combination of two independent attributes to find the total number of distinct symbols available for encoding.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Encoding Requirement (Symbols per Character)**\n*   The core of the problem is to figure out how many symbols from the Ching are needed to represent one character from the message. This is a basic information theory problem.\n*   We have 10 unique symbols in the Ching to encode 120 unique characters from the Shu.\n*   Let `k` be the number of Ching symbols used to represent one message character.\n*   With `k` symbols, we can create `10^k` unique combinations (codes).\n*   To be able to represent all 120 characters, the number of unique codes must be at least 120.\n    *   `10^k >= 120`\n*   Let's find the smallest integer `k` that satisfies this condition:\n    *   If `k = 1`, `10^1 = 10`. This is less than 120, so 1 symbol is not enough.\n    *   If `k = 2`, `10^2 = 100`. This is also less than 120, so 2 symbols are not enough.\n    *   If `k = 3`, `10^3 = 1000`. This is greater than 120, so 3 symbols are sufficient to uniquely encode each of the 120 characters.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must find the minimum number of symbols required per character to maximize the total length of the message. Using more than 3 symbols per character would work, but it would result in a shorter overall message.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Maximum Length of the Message**\n*   We have a total of 9999 symbols in the Ching.\n*   We have determined that each character of the message requires a block of 3 symbols from the Ching for its encoding.\n*   The maximum number of characters in the message is the total number of symbols available divided by the number of symbols needed per character.\n*   Maximum Message Length = Total Symbols / Symbols per Character\n*   Maximum Message Length = 9999 / 3\n*   Maximum Message Length = 3333 characters.\n\n**Step 5: Discard Irrelevant Information**\n*   **Careful Point:** Many problems include extra data to test analytical skills. It's crucial to identify what is not needed for the calculation.\n    *   \"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.\" - This is background information. The key detail is the alphabet size of 120.\n    *   \"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms.\" - This information relates to the speed of processing or decoding, not the capacity or length of the message.\n    *   \"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\" - This is also irrelevant performance data.\n\nThe calculation is based purely on the information capacity of the encoding medium (the Ching) relative to the information required to represent the message alphabet (from the Shu).\n\n<<<3333>>>"
