    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Object:** The tank is in the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangle faces, 30 equal edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   **The Orientation:** The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   **The Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled\" with water. This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Symmetry Properties**\n*   A regular icosahedron possesses a high degree of symmetry, including a point of symmetry at its geometric center.\n*   Any plane that passes through the center of a center-symmetric object will divide it into two parts of equal volume.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the surface of the water must be a plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n*   The surface of a liquid at rest (ignoring meniscus effects) is always horizontal.\n*   Therefore, the water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with this central, horizontal plane.\n*   When an object is viewed from a direction, its outline (or silhouette) is the projection of the object's widest part onto a plane perpendicular to the viewing direction.\n*   For a convex, centrally symmetric object like an icosahedron, the cross-section through the center is identical to the silhouette when viewed along an axis perpendicular to that cross-section.\n*   In our case, the icosahedron stands on a face. The vertical axis (perpendicular to the base and the water surface) passes through the center of the top and bottom faces. This is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   So, the shape of the water surface will be the same as the silhouette of the icosahedron when viewed from directly above (along this 3-fold axis).\n\n**Step 4: Visualize the Silhouette**\n*   To determine the silhouette, we need to identify which vertices of the icosahedron are furthest from the vertical viewing axis.\n*   The 12 vertices of the icosahedron, when oriented this way, are arranged in four horizontal layers of three vertices each.\n    *   Layer 1: The 3 vertices of the top face.\n    *   Layer 2: A set of 3 vertices, forming a larger triangle just below the top face.\n    *   Layer 3: Another set of 3 vertices, forming a larger triangle just above the bottom face.\n    *   Layer 4: The 3 vertices of the bottom face.\n*   The vertices that are furthest from the central vertical axis will be the ones that are closest to the central horizontal plane. These are the 6 vertices comprising Layer 2 and Layer 3.\n*   Due to the icosahedron's symmetry, these 6 vertices are all at the same distance from the central vertical axis. When viewed from above, their projections form the vertices of a regular polygon.\n*   The vertices of Layer 2 project to form an equilateral triangle. The vertices of Layer 3 project to form another equilateral triangle, rotated 60 degrees with respect to the first one.\n*   The combination of these six projected vertices forms a regular hexagon. The vertices from the top and bottom faces (Layers 1 and 4) project to points inside this hexagon.\n*   Therefore, the silhouette of the icosahedron in this orientation is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe water surface, being the central horizontal cross-section, takes the shape of this silhouette. Thus, the shape of the water surface will be a regular hexagon.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The concept of \"half-filled\" directly implies the water surface passes through the center of symmetry.\n*   The orientation \"standing on a face\" establishes the direction of the key symmetry axis (3-fold).\n*   The key insight is relating the central cross-section to the object's silhouette when viewed along the axis perpendicular to that section.\n*   Identifying the layers of vertices and determining which ones are furthest from the viewing axis is crucial to finding the shape of the silhouette. The 6 vertices of the \"waist\" of the icosahedron in this orientation form a regular hexagon when projected.\n\nFinal Answer: The shape will be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
