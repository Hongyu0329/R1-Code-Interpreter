    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Score:** The first step is to consult the full orchestral score of Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4. We need to navigate to the very end of the final movement, which is the \"IV. Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n2.  **Identify the First Violin Part:** Within the score, we must find the line designated for the \"Violino I\" or \"First Violin\". This is typically located at the top of the string section.\n\n3.  **Examine the Final Measure:** The symphony ends with a powerful, tutti (full orchestra) chord marked *fff* (fortississimo) with a fermata, indicating it should be held longer than its written value. We need to see what notes the first violins are playing in this final measure.\n\n4.  **Identify the Notes:** In this last measure, the first violins do not play a melodic sequence of three notes. Instead, they play a three-note chord, known as a triple-stop (playing three strings at once). The notes written on the treble clef staff for the first violin part are:\n    *   The highest note is F-sharp (F#5, on the second ledger line above the staff).\n    *   The middle note is D (D5, on the fourth line of the staff).\n    *   The lowest note is B (B4, on the middle line of the staff).\n\n5.  **Determine the Lowest Note:** These three notes (B, D, and F#) together form a B minor chord, which is the final chord of the symphony. By comparing the three pitches, we can identify the lowest one.\n    *   F#5 is the highest.\n    *   D5 is in the middle.\n    *   B4 is the lowest.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The question asks about the three notes the part \"ends on.\" In this case, it's not a melodic passage of three separate notes but a single chord comprised of three notes played simultaneously.\n*   It is crucial to correctly read the notes on the treble clef, including their octave designation (B4, D5, F#5), to accurately determine which is lowest.\n*   The key signature and any accidentals in the final measure must be taken into account. The F is explicitly marked with a sharp accidental (#).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the final chord in the first violin part of Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, the three notes are B4, D5, and F#5. The lowest of these three notes is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
