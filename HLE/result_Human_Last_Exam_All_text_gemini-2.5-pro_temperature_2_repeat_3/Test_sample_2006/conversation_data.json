    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Prompt**\n\n*   **The Goal:** To find a single word that is the answer to the question posed by the title.\n*   **The Title/Question:** \"The Bays\". This is a pun, which is common in these types of riddles. It sounds like \"The Baize\". Baize is a coarse woolen material, often green, used for things like pool tables and card tables.\n*   **The Clues:** The three lines of the haiku provide clues to identify the answer word.\n*   **The Final Instruction:** The answer's letters must be arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku's Clues**\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent storm. This points to a desperate or difficult situation. It could refer to needing help or rescue.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30 (`2 * 15 = 30`).\n    *   The number 30 is a very specific clue, famously associated with the \"thirty pieces of silver\" for which Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus.\n    *   This betrayal was certainly an event that brought \"winds of change\". This line points strongly to the name Judas.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to a holy figure, such as a saint.\n    *   \"Yields\" means to produce, provide, or surrender. In this context, it suggests a saint who provides help or hope.\n    *   This line cleverly distinguishes between Judas Iscariot (from Line 2) and another holy figure with a similar name: St. Jude Thaddeus. St. Jude is the patron saint of lost causes and desperate situations. He is the \"divine one\" who \"yields\" hope.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Find the Answer Word**\n\n1.  The haiku guides us towards the name **JUDE**. Line 2 alludes to the more famous Judas (Iscariot), while Line 3 clarifies that we're looking for the saintly one who \"yields\" hope—St. Jude. The \"tempest\" from Line 1 aligns with St. Jude being the patron of desperate cases.\n2.  The title \"The Bays\" acts as a final confirmation. As a pun for \"The Baize\" (green cloth), it points to the color green. St. Jude is the saint of hope and is traditionally depicted in artwork wearing green robes, symbolizing hope and renewal.\n3.  All clues consistently point to the single word answer: **JUDE**.\n\n**Step 4: Format the Final Answer**\n\n*   The puzzle states, \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\". This is an instruction to take the letters of the answer word, JUDE, and arrange them alphabetically.\n*   The letters are J, U, D, E.\n*   Arranging them in alphabetical order gives: D, E, J, U.\n\n<<<DEJU>>>"
