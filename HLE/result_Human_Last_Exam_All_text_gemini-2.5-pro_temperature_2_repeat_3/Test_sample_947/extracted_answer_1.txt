The magnetic field is directed along the z-axis, $\vec{H} = H_z(x)\hat{z}$, and its magnitude depends on the position $x$:
For the region outside the stack, $|x| > w$:
$H_z(x) = H_a$

For the region inside the stack, $|x| < w$:
$H_z(x) = \frac{D J_c d}{w \pi^2} \left( \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 w \pi^2 H_a}{D J_c d}} - 1 \right)$
