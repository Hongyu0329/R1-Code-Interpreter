    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisk\"**\nThe question refers to a Luxor Obelisk. There are two of them, originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The other obelisk was transported to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nA film depicting either of these locations would satisfy the question's criteria. Given Paris's prominence as a film setting, the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde is the more likely one to appear in an early film.\n\n**Step 2: Chronologically Review Best Picture Winners for Relevant Settings**\nWe must examine the winners in order from the first award ceremony to find the *earliest* example.\n\n*   **1st-9th Academy Awards (1927-1936):**\n    *   *Wings* (1927/28): Set in France during WWI, but focuses on battlefields, not Paris landmarks.\n    *   *The Broadway Melody* (1928/29): New York City.\n    *   *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30): German perspective on WWI.\n    *   *Cimarron* (1930/31): Oklahoma, USA.\n    *   *Grand Hotel* (1931/32): Berlin, Germany.\n    *   *Cavalcade* (1932/33): London, UK.\n    *   *It Happened One Night* (1934): USA.\n    *   *Mutiny on the Bounty* (1935): South Pacific and England.\n    *   *The Great Ziegfeld* (1936): New York City.\n    None of these films are set in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **10th Academy Awards (1937):**\n    *   The winner was ***The Life of Emile Zola***. This film is a biopic of the famous French writer and is set extensively in Paris during the late 19th century. Given its setting and historical context (including the Dreyfus Affair), it is a strong candidate. Upon review, the film's concluding sequence depicts the massive state funeral for Zola. This montage includes a clear shot of the funeral procession moving through the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk plainly visible.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm if *The Life of Emile Zola* is the First**\nSince we have found a winner from 1937 that fits the criteria, and have ruled out all previous winners, we can confidently state this is the first instance.\n\n**Step 4: Consider and Exclude Later Winners**\nFor the sake of thoroughness, it is useful to note other, later winners that also feature the obelisk.\n*   ***An American in Paris*** **(1951):** Famously features the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk in the climactic ballet sequence. However, it won 14 years after *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n*   ***Around the World in 80 Days*** **(1956):** The journey begins by passing through Paris, and includes shots of the city. It won after the other two.\n*   ***Gigi*** **(1958):** Is also set in Paris and features on-location filming, but again, won much later.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy proceeding chronologically through the list of Best Picture winners, the first film identified that depicts a Luxor Obelisk (specifically, the one in Paris's Place de la Concorde) is *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
