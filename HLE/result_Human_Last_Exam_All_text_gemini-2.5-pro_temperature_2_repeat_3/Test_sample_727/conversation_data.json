    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Position:** The game has reached move 130. It is Black's turn to move. The position on the board after White's `130. Kh3` is as follows:\n    *   **White:** King on h3, Rook on f5, Knight on g3, Pawn on e5.\n    *   **Black:** King on e8, Queen on a2.\n    White's main plan is to use their active king and the powerful passed e-pawn to create mating threats or promote the pawn. Black's only hope for survival is to use their queen to create a perpetual check or a fortress from which White cannot make progress.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Blunder in the Game (130...Qe6):** In the actual game, Ian Nepomniachtchi played `130...Qe6`. This was the losing move. The reason it loses is that it allows White's king to advance to h4 (`131. Kh4!`). After this, if Black tries to check with `131...Qh6+`, White can block the check with `132. Nh5!`. This single move traps the black queen behind White's pieces and attacks it, while also preparing to support the advance of the e-pawn. The game continued `132...Qh7 133.e6 Qg6 134.Rf7`, and White's attack became unstoppable, leading to Black's resignation a few moves later.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Alternative Queen Moves:** The task is to find a queen move that secures a draw. A successful move must prevent White's plan of activating the king and pushing the e-pawn, primarily by creating an unbreakable series of checks or a positional stalemate (zugzwang).\n\n    Let's analyze the given options carefully:\n\n    *   **C. Qg2+** and **H. Qh2+**: These initial checks might seem appealing, but they can be problematic. For example, `130... Qg2+ 131. Kh4`. Black needs to continue checking. A move like `131... Qh1+` would be met by the game-losing `132. Nh5` motif. However, a move like `131... Qe4+` would transpose into a known drawing line (similar to the one from Qc2). So `Qg2+` is a potential drawing move. `Qh2+` seems weaker as after `131. Kh4`, there is no good follow-up check.\n\n    *   **Moves on the a-file (A, B, G, I, J, K, N):** Moves like `Qa1`, `Qa7`, etc., aim to set up checks from the side. Let's analyze a sample, like `Qa1`. If White plays `131. Kh4`, Black can initiate a perpetual check with `131... Qe1+ 132. Kg4 Qe2+ 133. Kh3` and repeating checks. However, a critical test is White's other king move: `131. Kg4!`. This allows the white king to start a walk towards the center (`...Qe1+ 132. Kf4 Qd2+ 133. Ke4...`). This king escape route is very dangerous for Black and likely winning for White. Many of the moves from the a-file or d-file suffer from this vulnerability.\n\n    *   **L. Qc2:** This is a strong candidate. It prepares to meet `131. Kh4` with the powerful check `131... Qe4+`. White must then play `132. Kh3` (as `Kg4` leads to a similar perpetual), after which `132... Qh1+` begins a forced sequence: `133. Kg4 Qg2+ 134. Kh4 Qh2+ 135. Kg4`, from which the white king cannot escape. This is a clear perpetual check and thus a draw.\n\n    *   **D. Qf2:** This is an exceptionally strong and often cited drawing move. It creates a positional draw through zugzwang (a situation where any move a player makes worsens their position).\n        *   If White plays `131. Kh4`, Black responds with `131... Qf6+`, forcing the king back with `132. Kh3`. Now Black plays `132... Qf2`, repeating the position and leading to a draw by threefold repetition.\n        *   If White plays `131. Kg4`, Black plays the brilliant waiting move `131... Qf1!`. Now White has no good moves. The king can't move without allowing a devastating check. The knight can't move without allowing `Qxf5+`. The rook can't move without abandoning its post. And `132. e6` is met by `132... Qxf5+`, winning the rook. White is paralyzed and must repeat moves, leading to a draw.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Multiple moves from the list (including B, C, L, and D) could lead to a draw with perfect play. However, `130...Qf2` stands out as it leads to the cleanest and most decisive draw, forcing a repetition by creating a fortress that White's pieces cannot break. This move paralyzes White completely. The perpetual check lines are also valid draws but require demonstrating a longer sequence. In chess analysis, the most straightforward and conclusive solution is often considered the \"best.\"\n\nTherefore, `Qf2` is a perfect example of a move that would have saved the game for Black.\n\n<<<D>>>"
