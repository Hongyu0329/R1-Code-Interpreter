    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button in the described poker scenario.\n\n**1. Understand the Scenario:**\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB deep cash game.\n*   **Rake:** Rake-free. This is a crucial point, as the absence of rake makes more marginal hands profitable to play. We can and should open a wider range of hands than in a game with rake.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the best position in poker, as we are guaranteed to act last post-flop. This positional advantage allows us to play the widest range of any position at the table.\n*   **Action:** Opening for 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard opening size.\n*   **Hand Type:** Suited Jacks (JXs). This means hands like J2s, J3s, J4s, J5s, J6s, J7s, J8s, J9s, JTs. (AJs, KJs, QJs are premium hands and not considered in this \"worst of\" category).\n\n**2. Analyze the Goal:**\n\nThe question asks for the \"worst suited jack you *should* open\". This implies two things:\n1.  The hand must be a profitable open-raise. It's a hand we *should* play.\n2.  Among all the suited jacks that are profitable to open, we must find the one with the lowest expected value (EV).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Components of Hand Value for JXs:**\n\nA hand like JXs has value derived from several properties:\n*   **High Card Strength:** The Jack provides decent high-card value. It can win at showdown without improving and makes strong top pairs.\n*   **Flush Potential:** Being suited is a massive advantage. It allows us to make flushes, which are very strong hands. It also gives us equity on flush draw boards, allowing us to continue betting or calling profitably.\n*   **Straight Potential (Connectivity):** The value of the second card (the \"X\") greatly influences the hand's ability to make straights. Better connectivity means more ways to flop strong draws or made hands.\n\n**4. Ranking the Suited Jacks:**\n\nLet's rank the suited jacks from best to worst based on these properties. The Jack and the suitedness are constant; the only variable is the kicker card (\"X\").\n\n*   **JTs:** This is a premium suited connector. It can make the nut straight (with 987, QK A) and a strong Jack-high flush. This is one of the best hands in this category.\n*   **J9s:** A one-gap connector. It still makes nut straights (with QK8, T87) and is very playable. Clearly a strong open.\n*   **J8s:** A two-gap connector. Straight potential decreases but is still significant. A standard and profitable button open.\n*   **J7s:** A three-gap connector. Connectivity is becoming weaker, but it still exists. Also a standard open.\n*   **J6s & J5s:** The straight potential here is poor, though J5s has some unique playability as it can connect with low \"wheel\" cards (A, 2, 3, 4) to make a straight. This gives J5s a slight edge in playability over hands like J4s or J3s.\n*   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These hands have almost zero straight connectivity with the Jack. Their value comes almost entirely from making a Jack-high flush, a pair of Jacks, two pair, or trips.\n\n**5. Identifying the \"Worst\" Hand:**\n\nThe contest for the worst hand comes down to the bottom tier: J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n*   In this group, the primary value comes from the high card (J) and the flush potential. The secondary value comes from the kicker.\n*   When you make two pair, J4s (Jacks and Fours) is better than J3s (Jacks and Threes), which is better than J2s (Jacks and Twos).\n*   When you don't improve your hand, J-high with a 4-kicker is marginally better than a 3-kicker, which is better than a 2-kicker in rare showdown scenarios.\n*   The hand with the lowest cards and worst connectivity will have the lowest overall equity and playability. That hand is **J2s**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven that we are on the button in a rake-free game, our opening range should be very wide. Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers show that *all* suited jack combinations are profitable opens in this scenario. Because all of them are profitable opens, the \"worst one you should open\" is simply the one with the lowest expected value. Due to having the lowest kicker and the worst connectivity, **J2s** is the suited Jack with the lowest profitability, making it the correct answer.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
