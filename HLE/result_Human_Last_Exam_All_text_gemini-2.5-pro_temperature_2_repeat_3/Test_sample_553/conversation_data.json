    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Music Theory in the Question**\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of A minor, the tonic chord is A minor. This is often designated with the Roman numeral 'i' in a minor key or 'I' in a major key.\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. For example, in the key of A minor, the fifth note is E.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This specifies that the chord built on the fifth note must be a minor chord. In our A minor example, this would be an E minor chord. The Roman numeral for this is 'v'.\n*   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct and immediate movement from one chord to the next, right at the start of the song.\n\nSo, the question is looking for a Beatles song that begins with the progression **i -> v** (tonic minor to minor fifth chord).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Candidates**\n\nLet's consider some famous Beatles songs and their openings.\n\n*   **\"And I Love Her\":** The song is in C# minor during the verse. The verse chord progression is **C# minor (i) -> G# minor (v)**. This fits the i -> v pattern. However, the song doesn't *start* with this jump. It famously starts with a short, distinct acoustic guitar riff before the main chord progression begins.\n*   **\"Girl\":** This song is in C minor. The verse progression is **C minor (i) -> G7 (V)**. The G7 chord is a *major* dominant seventh chord, not a *minor* fifth chord as the question specifies. Therefore, this is not the correct song.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\":** The song is in E minor. The opening instrumental starts on a C major chord and then moves to the E minor (i) tonic chord. The progression is C (bVI) -> Em (i), which is not the pattern we are looking for.\n*   **\"Michelle\":** This is a very strong candidate. The song is in the key of F minor.\n    *   The tonic chord (i) is **F minor (Fm)**.\n    *   The fifth note in the F minor scale is C. The minor chord built on this note (the minor fifth chord, v) is **C minor (Cm)**.\n    *   The song opens with a memorable finger-picked acoustic guitar intro. The very first chord played is an arpeggiated F minor. This is immediately followed by an arpeggiated C minor.\n    *   This opening instrumental is a direct and clear jump from the tonic (Fm) to the minor fifth chord (Cm).\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the opening chord progressions of various Beatles songs, \"Michelle\" is the one that perfectly matches the criteria. It begins with an instrumental introduction that consists of a direct chord jump from the tonic (F minor) to the minor fifth chord (C minor).\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
