    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** We need to identify a physicist based on several specific clues:\n    *   **Field:** Primarily known for work in microscopy.\n    *   **Discovery:** An optical effect related to real imagery.\n    *   **Object of Study:** Concave mirrors (or a related optical element like a diffraction grating).\n    *   **Origin Story:** The effect was first accidentally observed by a custodial worker who was cleaning the mirrors.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **\"Physicist\" and \"Microscopy\":** This points to a major figure in the history of optics and microscopy. Candidates could include Ernst Abbe, Robert Hooke, Léon Foucault, or Frits Zernike.\n    *   **\"Concave Mirrors\" and \"Optical Effect\":** This connects the discovery to reflective optics. Concave mirrors can form real images. The work of Léon Foucault (Foucault test for telescope mirrors) and Frits Zernike (testing concave diffraction gratings) are highly relevant here.\n    *   **\"Accidentally observed by a custodial worker\":** This is a very specific anecdote. Stories of accidental or serendipitous discoveries are common in science, and this specific detail is the key to identifying the correct person. The story goes that a cleaner, while dusting a concave mirror (or grating), noticed that the tiny dust particles became brilliantly visible against a dark background.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Candidates:**\n    *   **Léon Foucault:** Famous for the Foucault knife-edge test, which uses a concave mirror to detect flaws. However, he is more famous for his pendulum and measurements of the speed of light, not primarily for microscopy. The custodial worker anecdote is not strongly associated with him.\n    *   **Other microscopy pioneers (Abbe, Hooke):** Their major discoveries (like Abbe's diffraction limit) do not align with the specific anecdote involving a cleaner and concave mirrors.\n    *   **Frits Zernike:** A Dutch physicist who won the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**.\n        *   **Connection to Microscopy:** His primary fame comes from this revolutionary contribution to microscopy, which allowed scientists to view unstained, transparent living cells for the first time.\n        *   **Connection to Concave Mirrors:** Zernike's discovery originated from his work in the 1930s on defects in **concave diffraction gratings** (a specialized type of ruled mirror used in spectroscopy).\n        *   **Connection to the Anecdote:** While developing a sensitive test for these gratings (an extension of Foucault's test), Zernike noticed faint, unexpected \"ghost\" images caused by imperfections. He realized these were phase shifts in the light being made visible. The story of this discovery is often told with the detail that the principle was first noticed when a custodial worker was cleaning the optical elements, making previously invisible dust particles and smears stand out sharply. This accidental observation of turning invisible phase objects (dust, smears) into visible amplitude objects is the very essence of phase contrast.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Frits Zernike perfectly matches all the criteria. He was a physicist whose most famous work was in microscopy. His discovery of phase contrast stemmed directly from his work with concave optical elements (diffraction gratings). Most importantly, his discovery is linked to the specific, memorable anecdote about an observation made while cleaning these optics.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Concave Mirror vs. Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating can be concave. Zernike's work was specifically with these gratings, but for the purpose of the riddle, it fits the \"concave mirror\" clue.\n*   **The Anecdote's Veracity:** While the \"custodial worker\" detail makes the story memorable, some historical accounts attribute the observation directly to Zernike noticing the effect himself. However, the anecdote is widely associated with the discovery of phase contrast and points uniquely to Zernike.\n*   **Optical Effect:** The effect discovered was phase contrast, which converts phase shifts in light (imperceptible to the human eye) into changes in amplitude (brightness), making transparent objects visible in a real image.\n\nBy synthesizing these points, we can confidently identify the physicist in question.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
