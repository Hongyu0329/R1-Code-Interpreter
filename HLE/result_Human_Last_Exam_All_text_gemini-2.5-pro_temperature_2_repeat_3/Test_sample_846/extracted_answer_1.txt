To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape from a relatively flat, straight configuration to a bent configuration when the sun rises. Then, when the sun sets and it becomes dark, the table must revert from the bent shape back to its original flat configuration. This mimics the photoisomerization of the azobenzene molecule, which switches from its stable *trans* isomer (flat) to its *cis* isomer (bent) upon exposure to UV light (daytime) and thermally relaxes back to the *trans* form in the dark (nighttime).
