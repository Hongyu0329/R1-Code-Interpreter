    "Answering the question involves a step-by-step analysis of the definitions of the graph-theoretic terms used.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` that has exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices:** A graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices is `|V| = 128`.\n    *   **Clique:** A subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n    *   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` has `S` as its vertex set and contains all edges from `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n    *   **\"A clique of size `k` appears as an induced subgraph\":** This means there exists a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V` with `|S| = k` such that the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph, `K_k`. This is equivalent to saying `S` is a clique in `G`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Set of Possible Clique Sizes:**\n    Let `C(G)` be the set of all integers `k` for which an induced clique of size `k` exists in the graph `G`. The question asks for the maximum possible value of `|C(G)|` over all graphs `G` on 128 vertices.\n\n4.  **The Crucial Insight:**\n    Let's examine the structure of the set `C(G)`. Suppose `G` has an induced clique of size `k`. This means there is a set of `k` vertices, let's call it `S`, where every pair of vertices in `S` is connected by an edge.\n    *   Let `k` be in `C(G)`.\n    *   Let `S` be the set of `k` vertices that form this induced clique.\n    *   Now, consider any integer `j` such that `1 ≤ j < k`. Can we find an induced clique of size `j`?\n    *   Yes. We can simply choose any subset `S'` of `S` that has `j` vertices. Since every pair of vertices in the larger set `S` is connected, every pair of vertices in the subset `S'` must also be connected.\n    *   Therefore, the subgraph induced by `S'`, which is `G[S']`, is a complete graph on `j` vertices (`K_j`).\n    *   This proves that if `k ∈ C(G)`, then `j ∈ C(G)` for all `1 ≤ j < k`.\n\n5.  **Characterizing the Set of Clique Sizes:**\n    The insight from the previous step implies that for any graph `G`, the set of its induced clique sizes must be an unbroken sequence of integers starting from 1. If the largest clique size is `k_max`, then the set of all clique sizes is `{1, 2, 3, ..., k_max}`.\n    *   This largest size, `k_max`, is known as the **clique number** of the graph `G`, denoted `ω(G)`.\n    *   So, for any graph `G`, `C(G) = {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\n6.  **Reformulating the Problem:**\n    The number of different clique sizes is `|C(G)|`, which is equal to `ω(G)`. The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` on 128 vertices.\n\n7.  **Finding the Maximum Clique Number:**\n    *   **Upper Bound:** A clique is a set of vertices. The size of a clique cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices, the clique number must satisfy `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n    *   **Achievability:** We must show that this upper bound can be reached. Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, `K_128`. In this graph, all 128 vertices are connected to each other. The entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique. Therefore, for `G = K_128`, the clique number is `ω(G) = 128`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is the maximum possible value of `ω(G)`, which is 128. This maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_128`. For this graph, the set of induced clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the number of distinct sizes is 128.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Induced vs. Not Induced:** The \"induced\" part of the specification is critical but naturally satisfied by the definition of a clique. A clique is a set of vertices, and the condition of all pairs being connected implies the induced subgraph is complete. If the question referred to subgraphs that are not necessarily induced, the answer could be different, but the phrasing is precise.\n*   **Maximal Cliques:** The question is about cliques, not *maximal* cliques (cliques that cannot be extended). If it were about maximal cliques, the problem would be substantially different and more complex. For example, the graph `K_{128}` has only one maximal clique (of size 128), so it would only yield one size.\n*   **Simplicity of the Argument:** The logic is very direct, following from fundamental definitions. It is important not to overthink the problem and search for unnecessary complexity. The structure of the set of induced clique sizes is the key that makes the problem simple.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nBased on the analysis, the maximum number of different clique sizes corresponds to the maximum possible clique number in a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n*   Maximum clique number `ω(G)` for a graph on `n` vertices is `n`.\n*   For `n = 128`, the maximum clique number is 128.\n*   This is achieved by the graph `K_{128}`.\n*   The set of induced clique sizes for `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n*   The number of elements in this set is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
