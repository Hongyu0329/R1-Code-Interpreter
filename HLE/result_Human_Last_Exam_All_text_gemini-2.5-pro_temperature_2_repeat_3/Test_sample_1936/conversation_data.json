    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the definition of a group.**\nA group is a set G, combined with a binary operation `·`, denoted as (G, `·`), that satisfies the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a · b, is also in G. (The problem states that `·` is a binary operation on G, which already implies closure).\n2.  **Associativity:** For all a, b, c in G, (a · b) · c = a · (b · c).\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element e in G such that for every element a in G, the equation e · a = a · e = a holds.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each a in G, there exists an element a⁻¹ in G such that a · a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ · a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size of the set G, which we call `n`, for which it is possible to define a binary operation `·` such that (G, `·`) is *not* a group. This means the structure must fail at least one of the associativity, identity, or inverse axioms.\n\n**2. Analyze the cases for small values of n.**\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   The set is the empty set, G = {}. A binary operation is a function from G × G to G. Since G × G is empty, there is one such function (the empty function).\n    *   Let's check the group axioms. The axioms that start with \"For all elements...\" (Closure, Associativity) are vacuously true because there are no elements to test.\n    *   However, the axiom \"There exists an identity element e in G...\" is false, because the set G is empty and contains no elements.\n    *   Therefore, the empty set with its unique binary operation is not a group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Most standard mathematical texts and courses (especially in introductory algebra) define a group to be a *non-empty* set. The existence of an identity element requires the set to be non-empty. Assuming the standard definition that a group must be non-empty, we consider n > 0.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   Let the set be G = {e}.\n    *   For `·` to be a binary operation, we must define e · e. The only possible result that satisfies closure is e · e = e.\n    *   Now, let's check the group axioms for (G, ·):\n        1.  **Closure:** e · e = e, which is in G. (Satisfied)\n        2.  **Associativity:** (e · e) · e = e · e = e. Also, e · (e · e) = e · e = e. So, it is associative. (Satisfied)\n        3.  **Identity Element:** The element `e` acts as the identity because e · e = e. (Satisfied)\n        4.  **Inverse Element:** The inverse of `e` is an element x such that e · x = e. Since e · e = e, `e` is its own inverse. (Satisfied)\n    *   Since all axioms are satisfied, any set of size 1 with a binary operation is always a group (this is called the trivial group). Therefore, it is impossible to construct a non-group for n=1.\n\n*   **Case n = 2:**\n    *   Let the set be G = {a, b}.\n    *   We need to check if it's possible to define a binary operation `·` that fails at least one of the group axioms (associativity, identity, or inverse). Let's try to construct such an operation using a Cayley table.\n    *   **Attempt to fail the Identity Axiom:**\n        *   Let's define the operation as x · y = x for any x, y in G.\n        *   The Cayley table is:\n| · | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| a | a | a |\n| b | b | b |\n        *   Let's check for an identity element `e`. An identity element must satisfy `e · x = x` and `x · e = x` for all `x` in G.\n        *   Is `a` the identity? We need a · b = b. But from the table, a · b = a. So `a` is not the identity.\n        *   Is `b` the identity? We need b · a = a. But from the table, b · a = b. So `b` is not the identity.\n        *   Since neither element can be the identity, this structure fails the identity axiom.\n        *   Therefore, (G, ·) is not a group.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nWe have found that:\n*   For n = 1, any structure (G, ·) must be a group.\n*   For n = 2, we successfully constructed a structure (G, ·) that is not a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number `n` for which such a set and operation exist is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
