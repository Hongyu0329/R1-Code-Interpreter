    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements of the question:** The question asks about a specific painting by a specific artist in a specific year and context. The key elements are:\n    *   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n    *   **Year:** 1933\n    *   **Subject:** A self-portrait\n    *   **Context:** After escaping from the Gestapo\n    *   **Specific Detail:** What he holds in his hand.\n    *   **Symbolism:** Its meaning as a symbol of resistance.\n\n2.  **Research the specific artwork:** A search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the painting titled *Selbstbildnis mit Distel* (Self-Portrait with Thistle).\n\n3.  **Confirm the context:** Historical records confirm that Curt Querner, a member of the Communist Party and an anti-fascist artist, was arrested by the Gestapo in Dresden in March 1933. He painted this self-portrait after his release later that year. This matches the context given in the question.\n\n4.  **Identify the object in his hand:** The title of the painting, *Selbstbildnis mit Distel*, directly translates to \"Self-Portrait with Thistle\". Visual inspection of the painting confirms that he is holding a large, thorny thistle in his bare hand.\n\n5.  **Analyze the symbolism of the thistle:** To understand why the thistle is a symbol of resistance, we must consider its characteristics.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Resilience:** Thistles are hardy, tough weeds that are very difficult to eradicate. They can survive and grow in harsh, unwelcoming conditions. This mirrors Querner's own resilience and survival after his imprisonment.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Defensiveness:** Thistles are covered in sharp thorns, making them prickly and defensive. This represents defiance and an unwillingness to be \"handled\" or suppressed easily. By holding the thorny plant, Querner symbolizes his defiant spirit against the oppressive Nazi regime.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Connection to the land:** Querner was known for his paintings of rural life and laborers. The thistle, a common plant of the fields, connects his personal struggle to a broader, more grounded form of existence, in contrast to the artificial and brutal ideology of the Nazis.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Personal sacrifice:** He holds the thorny plant in his bare hand, suggesting that resistance comes with pain and personal sacrifice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy bringing these points together, we can conclude that in his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a thistle. This object is a powerful symbol of his resistance, representing defiance, resilience, and the painful nature of his struggle against the Gestapo and the burgeoning Nazi regime.\n\n***\n\nIn his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a **thistle** in his hand.\n\n<<<a thistle>>>"
