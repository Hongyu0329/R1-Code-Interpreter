    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we list the naturally occurring noble gases, which are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*(Note: Oganesson is also in Group 18, but it is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is excluded from consideration.)*\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\" in the year 2002.\n*   **\"All terrestrial matter\"** includes the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, crust, mantle, and core. However, the primary reservoir for noble gases on Earth is the atmosphere. Their concentrations in the solid Earth are extremely low. Therefore, comparing their atmospheric concentrations is a reliable proxy for their overall abundance.\n*   **\"in 2002\"**: The relative abundances of these gases in the atmosphere are geologically stable and have not changed in any significant way by 2002 or since. So, we can use standard, accepted values for their atmospheric concentration.\n\n**Step 3: Gather Abundance Data for Each Noble Gas**\nWe will look at the typical abundance of each gas in Earth's atmosphere, usually expressed in parts per million by volume (ppmv).\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant noble gas. Its concentration is about 9,340 ppm, which is approximately 0.934% of the atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant. Its concentration is about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant. Its concentration is about 5.2 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The fourth most abundant. Its concentration is about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the stable noble gases. Its concentration is about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n*   **Radon (Rn):** This gas is a special case. It is radioactive and is continuously formed by the radioactive decay of radium in the Earth's crust. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days. Because it decays so quickly, its concentration in the atmosphere is extremely low and variable. The average mass fraction of Radon in the atmosphere is estimated to be on the order of 6 x 10⁻²⁰, which is many orders of magnitude smaller than any other noble gas.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Abundances**\nLet's list the noble gases in order from most abundant to least abundant based on their atmospheric concentration:\n1.  Argon (Ar) - ~0.934%\n2.  Neon (Ne) - ~0.0018%\n3.  Helium (He) - ~0.00052%\n4.  Krypton (Kr) - ~0.00011%\n5.  Xenon (Xe) - ~0.000009%\n6.  **Radon (Rn)** - Extremely trace amounts (e.g., ~6 x 10⁻¹⁸ %), far less than Xenon.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer**\nAlthough Xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas, the question does not exclude radioactive elements. Radon is a naturally occurring noble gas on Earth. Due to its extreme radioactivity and very short half-life, its overall quantity at any given moment is infinitesimal compared to all other noble gases. Therefore, Radon is the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The question does not specify a \"stable\" noble gas, so radioactive ones like Radon must be included.\n*   The year 2002 is not a critical detail, as the abundance levels of these gases are stable over very long timescales.\n*   \"Terrestrial matter\" is best represented by atmospheric abundance for these gases, which simplifies the comparison.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis: Based on the facts, Radon's extremely low and transient presence makes it the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
