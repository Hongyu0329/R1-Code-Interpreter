    "This question is a riddle that uses names to represent numbers from different historical numeral systems. To find the solution, we must first decipher what number each name represents and then perform the calculation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Equation:** The equation provided is `kvadrans/unus unu-unus unu unu=?`. We need to convert each named term into a modern number.\n\n2.  **Interpret `kvadrans`:**\n    *   The word `kvadrans` is often used in puzzles to refer to a specific symbol. In this context, it typically represents the Coptic numeral for the number **8**.\n    *   This interpretation is supported by related concepts: a quadrant divides a circle into 4 parts, and if those are bisected, you get 8 octants.\n\n3.  **Interpret `unus unu`:**\n    *   The name `unus unu` is Latin for \"one one\" or \"unit unit\". This name is commonly used in riddles to describe the Mayan numeral for **10**.\n    *   In the Mayan system, a horizontal bar represents the number 5. Therefore, two horizontal bars (`unus unu`) represent 5 + 5 = 10.\n\n4.  **Interpret `unus unu unu`:**\n    *   The name `unus unu unu` is Latin for \"one one one\". This directly describes the construction of the Roman numeral **III**.\n    *   The Roman numeral `I` stands for one. Three of them written together, `III`, represent the number **3**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Equation with Modern Numbers:**\n    *   Now we can substitute the modern numbers we've found back into the original equation's structure:\n        *   `kvadrans` = 8\n        *   `unus unu` = 10\n        *   `unus unu unu` = 3\n    *   The equation becomes: **8 / 10 - 3**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Solution:**\n    *   Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we must perform the division before the subtraction.\n    *   **Division:** 8 / 10 = 0.8\n    *   **Subtraction:** 0.8 - 3 = **-2.2**\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe equation `kvadrans/unus unu-unus unu unu` translates to `8 / 10 - 3`.\nFirst, calculate the division: 8 ÷ 10 = 0.8.\nThen, perform the subtraction: 0.8 - 3 = -2.2.\n\n<<<-2.2>>>"
