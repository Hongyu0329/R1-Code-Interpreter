    "Answering this question requires performing a Lie symmetry analysis on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **The Equations:** The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ are given by:\n    *   Momentum equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n    *   Incompressibility condition: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n    Here, $\\nu > 0$ is the constant kinematic viscosity.\n\n2.  **Lie Group of Symmetries:** We are looking for the dimension of the Lie group of transformations of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that map solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to other solutions. The dimension of this group is equal to the dimension of its associated Lie algebra, which is spanned by the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformations.\n\n3.  **Identification of Symmetries:** A standard, though lengthy, calculation of the Lie point symmetries reveals several families of transformations.\n\n    *   **Galilean Symmetries:** These are the standard symmetries of classical mechanics.\n        *   **Time translation:** $t' = t + s$ (1 parameter). The equations are autonomous. Dimension: **1**.\n        *   **Space translations:** $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$ (3 parameters). The equations are invariant under translation in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Dimension: **3**.\n        *   **Spatial rotations:** $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$ where $R \\in SO(3)$ (3 parameters). The equations are isotropic. Dimension: **3**.\n        *   **Galilean boosts:** $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t, \\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$ (3 parameters). This corresponds to changing to a uniformly moving frame of reference. Dimension: **3**.\n        These Galilean symmetries account for a $1+3+3+3=10$ dimensional Lie subalgebra.\n\n    *   **Scaling Symmetry:** The Navier-Stokes equations admit a specific scaling symmetry. If we apply the transformation:\n        $t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$\n        the equations remain invariant. This is a one-parameter family of transformations (parameter $\\lambda$). Dimension: **1**.\n\n4.  **A Careful Point: Infinite-Dimensional Symmetries:** A full analysis shows that the complete Lie symmetry group is actually infinite-dimensional. This is due to two facts:\n    a) The pressure $p$ only appears as its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This allows for the symmetry $p' = p + g(t)$, where $g(t)$ is an *arbitrary* function of time.\n    b) There exists a family of generalized Galilean transformations involving arbitrary vector-valued functions of time.\n\n5.  **The Maximal Finite-Dimensional Subgroup:** When a question asks for \"the dimension\" of such a group, it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra*. This is typically found by imposing physically reasonable constraints, such as requiring solutions to decay at infinity.\n    *   Imposing such boundary conditions restricts the arbitrary function $g(t)$ to be a constant, $g(t) = C$. This reduces the infinite-dimensional symmetry to a single one-parameter symmetry:\n        *   **Constant pressure shift:** $p' = p + C$. Dimension: **1**.\n    *   The same physical constraints restrict the generalized Galilean transformations to the standard ones already listed above.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Summing the dimensions of the generators for the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group, we get:\n    *   Time Translation: 1\n    *   Space Translations: 3\n    *   Rotations: 3\n    *   Galilean Boosts: 3\n    *   Scaling: 1\n    *   Constant Pressure Shift: 1\n    The total dimension is $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nThis 12-dimensional Lie algebra is known as the Navier-Stokes algebra.\n\n<<<12>>>"
