    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Coiled-Coil Structure:**\n    *   Coiled-coils consist of two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other.\n    *   They are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a **heptad repeat**, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n    *   The stability and oligomeric state of a coiled-coil are primarily determined by the hydrophobic interactions between amino acid side chains at the core of the structure.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Positions of the Heptad Repeat:**\n    *   In the `(abcdefg)` heptad repeat, the **`a` and `d` positions** are the core positions. Residues at these positions are typically hydrophobic (e.g., Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine) and pack against each other in the center of the helical bundle. This packing is often described as a **\"knobs-into-holes\"** interaction.\n    *   The `e` and `g` positions are often charged or polar and form electrostatic interactions between helices.\n    *   The `b`, `c`, and `f` positions are typically solvent-exposed.\n\n3.  **Determine the Heptad Repeat Registration in the Given Sequence:**\n    *   The sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n    *   We must find the correct `(abcdefg)` assignment where the `a` and `d` positions are consistently occupied by hydrophobic residues. We can test different starting points (registrations).\n    *   Let's test the registration where the first Leucine (`L`) at position 7 is an `a` residue. This is a common starting point for analysis, as `L` is a canonical core residue.\n        *   Sequence: `G E I A Q S` | `L K E I A K S` | `L K E I A W S` | `L K E I A Q S` | `L K G`\n        *   Registration: `(prefix)`    | `a b c d e f g` | `a b c d e f g` | `a b c d e f g` | `a b c(suffix)`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Amino Acids at the Core Positions (`a` and `d`):**\n    *   Using the registration determined in the previous step, let's list the residues at each `a` and `d` position throughout the repeating part of the sequence.\n        *   **Heptad 1 (`LKEIAKS`):** `a = L`, `d = I`\n        *   **Heptad 2 (`LKEIAWS`):** `a = L`, `d = I`\n        *   **Heptad 3 (`LKEIAQS`):** `a = L`, `d = I`\n        *   **Heptad 4 (`LKG`):** `a = L` (truncated repeat)\n    *   **Conclusion:** The core is almost perfectly composed of **Leucine (L) at the `a` position** and **Isoleucine (I) at the `d` position**.\n\n5.  **Consider the Role of the Tryptophan (W):**\n    *   In the second heptad (`LKEIAWS`), the Tryptophan (`W`) is at the `f` position (`a=L, b=K, c=E, d=I, e=A, f=W, g=S`).\n    *   The `f` position is solvent-exposed, not part of the hydrophobic core. Therefore, the bulky `W` residue does not interfere with the core packing and is not the primary determinant of the oligomeric state. Its presence is a distractor if the registration is not identified correctly.\n\n6.  **Apply Knobs-into-Holes Packing Rules to Determine Oligomeric State:**\n    *   The specific combination of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions dictates the most stable and efficient packing arrangement, and thus the oligomeric state.\n    *   The rules of thumb derived from experimental studies (e.g., on the GCN4 protein) are as follows:\n        *   `a=L, d=L` → Dimer (classic Leucine Zipper)\n        *   `a=I, d=L` → Trimer (β-branched residue at `a`)\n        *   **`a=L, d=I` → Tetramer** (β-branched residue at `d`)\n    *   Our sequence has the clear pattern of `a=L` and `d=I`. Isoleucine is a β-branched amino acid (its side chain branches at the β-carbon), while Leucine is not. This specific combination optimizes packing efficiency in a parallel four-helix bundle (a tetramer).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the heptad repeat reveals a consistent core pattern of Leucine at the `a` position and Isoleucine at the `d` position. Based on established principles of coiled-coil assembly and knobs-into-holes packing, this specific `a=L, d=I` motif strongly favors the formation of a **tetramer**.\n\nThe oligomeric state would be **4**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
