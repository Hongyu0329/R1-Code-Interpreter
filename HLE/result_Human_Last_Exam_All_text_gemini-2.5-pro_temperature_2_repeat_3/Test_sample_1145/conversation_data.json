    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the System and the Question**\n\n*   **System:** A quantum particle confined to a one-dimensional box.\n*   **Box dimensions:** The box extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   **Quantum State:** The particle is in the second energy level, so the principal quantum number is `n = 2`.\n*   **Question:** What is the probability of finding this particle in the small interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`?\n\n### **Step 2: Recall the Relevant Physics Principles**\n\n1.  **Wavefunction (ψ):** The state of the particle is described by its wavefunction. For a 1D particle-in-a-box, the normalized wavefunction is:\n    `ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n\n2.  **Probability Density (P(x)):** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, `P(x) = |ψn(x)|²`.\n    `P_n(x) = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`\n\n3.  **Probability in an Interval:** The probability of finding the particle between two points `x₁` and `x₂` is the integral of the probability density function over that interval:\n    `Prob(x₁ to x₂) = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P_n(x) dx`\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Principles to the Specific Case (n = 2)**\n\nFor `n = 2`, the probability density function is:\n`P₂(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\nThe probability we want to find is the integral of `P₂(x)` from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`:\n`Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Interval and Choose a Calculation Method**\n\n*   The interval is centered at `x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a = a/2`.\n*   The width of the interval is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`. This is a very small fraction of the box length.\n*   **Careful Point:** Let's examine the value of the probability density at the center of the interval, `x = a/2`. For `n=2`, this point is a node:\n    `P₂(a/2) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(a/2) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = 0`\n*   Since the probability density is zero at the center of our small interval, we cannot use the simple approximation `Prob ≈ P(center) * Δx`. We must use a more precise method, such as direct integration or a Taylor series approximation.\n\n### **Step 5: Method - Taylor Series Approximation (Highly Accurate for Small Intervals)**\n\nSince the interval is very small and centered around a point `x₀ = a/2` where the function `P₂(x)` and its first derivative are zero, we can approximate `P₂(x)` with its Taylor series.\n`P(x) ≈ P(x₀) + P'(x₀)(x - x₀) + (1/2)P''(x₀)(x - x₀)²`\n\n1.  `P₂(a/2) = 0` (as calculated above).\n2.  `P'₂(x) = d/dx [(2/a)sin²(2πx/a)] = (8π/a²)sin(2πx/a)cos(2πx/a)`. At `x = a/2`, `sin(π)=0`, so `P'₂(a/2) = 0`.\n3.  `P''₂(x) = d/dx [(4π/a²)sin(4πx/a)] = (16π²/a³)cos(4πx/a)`. At `x = a/2`, `cos(2π)=1`, so `P''₂(a/2) = 16π²/a³`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the Taylor series:\n`P₂(x) ≈ 0 + 0 + (1/2) * (16π²/a³) * (x - a/2)²`\n`P₂(x) ≈ (8π²/a³) * (x - a/2)²`\n\nNow, integrate this simplified function over the interval:\n`Prob ≈ ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (8π²/a³) * (x - a/2)² dx`\n\n`Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ (x - a/2)³ / 3 ]` evaluated from `0.495a` to `0.505a`\n\n`Prob ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [ (0.505a - 0.5a)³ - (0.495a - 0.5a)³ ]`\n\n`Prob ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [ (0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³ ]`\n\n`Prob ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [ 2 * (0.005a)³ ]`\n\nThe `a³` terms cancel out:\n`Prob ≈ (16π² / 3) * (0.005)³`\n\n### **Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\n`Prob ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (5 x 10⁻³)³`\n`Prob ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)`\n`Prob ≈ (16 * 125 * π² / 3) * 10⁻⁹`\n`Prob ≈ (2000 * π² / 3) * 10⁻⁹`\n`Prob ≈ (2/3) * π² * 10⁻⁶`\n\nUsing `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n`Prob ≈ (2/3) * 9.8696 * 10⁻⁶`\n`Prob ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶`\n\nThe probability is approximately `0.00000658`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
