    "### Step-by-step analysis of the problem\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Regular Expression**\n\nThe given regular expression is $L = ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*$.\nLet's define some simpler parts to make it more readable:\n- Let $X = (b | c)^*$. This represents any string composed of only 'b's and 'c's.\n- Let $Y = ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*$. This represents strings formed by concatenating blocks of 'a', 'bc', 'cb', or 'bbb'.\n- Let $Z = (b a | b b a | c a)$. This represents the specific strings 'ba', 'bba', or 'ca'.\n\nUsing these, the language $L$ can be expressed as:\n$L = (X a Y Z)^* X a Y$\n\nLet's call the repeating part $U = XaYZ$ and the final part $V = XaY$.\nSo, $L = U^*V$. This means a string in $L$ consists of zero or more concatenations of strings from $U$, followed by one string from $V$.\n\n**2. High-Level Structure of Strings in L**\n\n- Any string in $L$ must contain at least one 'a' because the final part $V = XaY$ must contain an 'a'.\n- The structure suggests building a state machine that keeps track of which part of the expression is being parsed.\n\n**3. Building a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)**\n\nWe can design an NFA based on the structure of the regular expression. Let's define the states of the NFA based on the \"parsing stage\" of the input string.\n\n- **State $S_A$ (Start State):** This state represents having read a string that is in $X=(b|c)^*$. This can be at the beginning of the string or after a complete $U = XaYZ$ block. From $S_A$, reading a 'b' or 'c' keeps us in $S_A$. Reading an 'a' moves us to the next stage.\n  - $\\delta(S_A, b) = S_A$\n  - $\\delta(S_A, c) = S_A$\n  - $\\delta(S_A, a) = S_Y$\n\n- **State $S_Y$:** This state represents having just completed an `...aY` segment. This means we have read a string of the form `...a` followed by a (possibly empty) string from $Y$.\n  - Because a string from $V = XaY$ makes a valid word in $L$, and the empty string $\\epsilon$ is in $Y$, any string reaching state $S_Y$ should be accepted. Thus, $S_Y$ is an accepting state.\n  - From $S_Y$, we can either parse another string from $Y$ or start parsing a string from $Z$.\n  - **Parsing Y from $S_Y$:** The structure of $Y = ( a | bc | cb | bbb )^*$ requires intermediate states to recognize the multi-character blocks.\n    - $S_Y \\xrightarrow{a} S_Y$\n    - $S_Y \\xrightarrow{b} S_{Yb}$ (for 'bc' and 'bbb')\n    - $S_Y \\xrightarrow{c} S_{Yc}$ (for 'cb')\n    - $S_{Yb} \\xrightarrow{c} S_Y$ (completes 'bc')\n    - $S_{Yb} \\xrightarrow{b} S_{Ybb}$ (intermediate for 'bbb')\n    - $S_{Ybb} \\xrightarrow{b} S_Y$ (completes 'bbb')\n    - $S_{Yc} \\xrightarrow{b} S_Y$ (completes 'cb')\n  - **Parsing Z from $S_Y$:** After parsing a $Y$ component, we can parse a $Z$ component. $Z = (ba|bba|ca)$. After a successful parse of $Z$, we complete a whole $U=XaYZ$ block. The expression then allows for another $X$ block. This means we should transition back to state $S_A$.\n    - $S_Y \\xrightarrow{b} S_{Zb} \\xrightarrow{a} S_A$ (for 'ba')\n    - $S_Y \\xrightarrow{b} S_{Zb1} \\xrightarrow{b} S_{Zb2} \\xrightarrow{a} S_A$ (for 'bba')\n    - $S_Y \\xrightarrow{c} S_{Zc} \\xrightarrow{a} S_A$ (for 'ca')\n\nNote that there's non-determinism. For example, from $S_Y$, on input 'b', the NFA can transition to multiple states ($S_{Yb}$, $S_{Zb}$, $S_{Zb1}$).\n\n**4. Convert NFA to DFA using Subset Construction**\n\nWe convert the NFA to a DFA. The states of the DFA will be sets of states from the NFA.\n\n- **DFA Start State:** $D_0 = \\{S_A\\}$. Non-accepting.\n  - $D_0 \\xrightarrow{b,c} \\{S_A\\} = D_0$.\n  - $D_0 \\xrightarrow{a} \\{S_Y\\} = D_1$.\n\n- **DFA State $D_1 = \\{S_Y\\}$:** This state is accepting because it contains the accepting NFA state $S_Y$.\n  - $D_1 \\xrightarrow{a} \\{S_Y\\} = D_1$.\n  - $D_1 \\xrightarrow{b}$ The NFA can transition to $S_{Yb}$ (for Y's 'bc'), $S_{Yb}$ (for Y's 'bbb'), $S_{Zb}$ (for Z's 'ba'), and $S_{Zb1}$ (for Z's 'bba'). Let's call these NFA states collectively `{Y_b, Z_b, Z_{bb1}}`. The new DFA state is $D_2 = \\{S_{Yb}, S_{Zb}, S_{Zb1}\\}$. Not accepting.\n  - $D_1 \\xrightarrow{c}$ The NFA can transition to $S_{Yc}$ (for Y) and $S_{Zc}$ (for Z). The new DFA state is $D_3 = \\{S_{Yc}, S_{Zc}\\}$. Not accepting.\n\n- **DFA State $D_2 = \\{S_{Yb}, S_{Zb}, S_{Zb1}\\}$**:\n  - $D_2 \\xrightarrow{a}$ From $S_{Zb}$, the NFA goes to $S_A$. The other paths terminate. So, $\\to \\{S_A\\} = D_0$.\n  - $D_2 \\xrightarrow{b}$ From $S_{Yb}$ the NFA goes to $S_{Ybb}$. From $S_{Zb1}$ it goes to $S_{Zb2}$. So, $\\to \\{S_{Ybb}, S_{Zb2}\\} = D_4$.\n  - $D_2 \\xrightarrow{c}$ From $S_{Yb}$ the NFA goes to $S_Y$. The other paths terminate. So, $\\to \\{S_Y\\} = D_1$.\n\n- **DFA State $D_3 = \\{S_{Yc}, S_{Zc}\\}$**:\n  - $D_3 \\xrightarrow{a}$ From $S_{Zc}$, the NFA goes to $S_A$. So, $\\to \\{S_A\\} = D_0$.\n  - $D_3 \\xrightarrow{b}$ From $S_{Yc}$, the NFA goes to $S_Y$. So, $\\to \\{S_Y\\} = D_1$.\n  - $D_3 \\xrightarrow{c}$ All paths terminate. So, $\\to \\emptyset = D_{dead}$.\n\n- **DFA State $D_4 = \\{S_{Ybb}, S_{Zb2}\\}$**:\n  - $D_4 \\xrightarrow{a}$ From $S_{Zb2}$, the NFA goes to $S_A$. So, $\\to \\{S_A\\} = D_0$.\n  - $D_4 \\xrightarrow{b}$ From $S_{Ybb}$, the NFA goes to $S_Y$. So, $\\to \\{S_Y\\} = D_1$.\n  - $D_4 \\xrightarrow{c}$ All paths terminate. So, $\\to \\emptyset = D_{dead}$.\n\n- **DFA State $D_{dead} = \\emptyset$**: This is a non-accepting sink state.\n  - $D_{dead} \\xrightarrow{a,b,c} D_{dead}$.\n\nWe have found the following reachable DFA states: $D_0, D_1, D_2, D_3, D_4, D_{dead}$. This is a 6-state DFA.\n\n**5. Minimize the DFA**\n\nWe use the state minimization algorithm (based on Myhill-Nerode theorem). We partition states into accepting and non-accepting sets and refine the partition.\n\n- **Initial Partition ($P_0$):**\n  - Accepting states: $F = \\{D_1\\}$\n  - Non-accepting states: $N = \\{D_0, D_2, D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$\n\n- **Refining the partition:** We check transitions for each state in $N$.\n  - **On input 'a':**\n    - $\\delta(D_0, a) = D_1 \\in F$.\n    - $\\delta(D_2, a) = D_0 \\in N$.\n    - $\\delta(D_3, a) = D_0 \\in N$.\n    - $\\delta(D_4, a) = D_0 \\in N$.\n    - $\\delta(D_{dead}, a) = D_{dead} \\in N$.\n    - $D_0$ is distinguishable from the others in $N$. So we partition $N$ into $\\{D_0\\}$ and $\\{D_2, D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$.\n    - **$P_1 = \\{\\{D_1\\}, \\{D_0\\}, \\{D_2, D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}\\}$**\n\n  - **Refining $\\{D_2, D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$ on input 'c':**\n    - $\\delta(D_2, c) = D_1 \\in \\{D_1\\}$ (from $P_1$).\n    - $\\delta(D_3, c) = D_{dead} \\in \\{D_2, D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$ (from $P_1$).\n    - $\\delta(D_4, c) = D_{dead} \\in \\{D_2, D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$ (from $P_1$).\n    - $\\delta(D_{dead}, c) = D_{dead} \\in \\{D_2, D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$ (from $P_1$).\n    - $D_2$ is distinguishable from the rest. We partition $\\{D_2, D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$ into $\\{D_2\\}$ and $\\{D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$.\n    - **$P_2 = \\{\\{D_1\\}, \\{D_0\\}, \\{D_2\\}, \\{D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}\\}$**\n\n  - **Refining $\\{D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$ on input 'b':**\n    - $\\delta(D_3, b) = D_1 \\in \\{D_1\\}$ (from $P_2$).\n    - $\\delta(D_4, b) = D_1 \\in \\{D_1\\}$ (from $P_2$).\n    - $\\delta(D_{dead}, b) = D_{dead} \\in \\{D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$ (from $P_2$).\n    - $D_{dead}$ is distinguishable from $D_3, D_4$. We partition $\\{D_3, D_4, D_{dead}\\}$ into $\\{D_{dead}\\}$ and $\\{D_3, D_4\\}$.\n    - **$P_3 = \\{\\{D_1\\}, \\{D_0\\}, \\{D_2\\}, \\{D_{dead}\\}, \\{D_3, D_4\\}\\}$**\n\n  - **Refining $\\{D_3, D_4\\}$:**\n    - $\\delta(D_3, a) = D_0 \\in \\{D_0\\}$. $\\delta(D_4, a) = D_0 \\in \\{D_0\\}$. (Same class)\n    - $\\delta(D_3, b) = D_1 \\in \\{D_1\\}$. $\\delta(D_4, b) = D_1 \\in \\{D_1\\}$. (Same class)\n    - $\\delta(D_3, c) = D_{dead} \\in \\{D_{dead}\\}$. $\\delta(D_4, c) = D_{dead} \\in \\{D_{dead}\\}$. (Same class)\n    - $D_3$ and $D_4$ are indistinguishable. We merge them.\n\nThe final partition representing the states of the minimal DFA is $P_3 = \\{\\{D_0\\}, \\{D_1\\}, \\{D_2\\}, \\{D_3, D_4\\}, \\{D_{dead}\\}\\}$.\n\nThere are 5 sets in the final partition. Each set corresponds to one state in the minimal DFA.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe minimal DFA has 5 states:\n1. State corresponding to $\\{D_0\\}$ (Initial state)\n2. State corresponding to $\\{D_1\\}$ (The only accepting state)\n3. State corresponding to $\\{D_2\\}$\n4. State corresponding to $\\{D_3, D_4\\}$\n5. State corresponding to $\\{D_{dead}\\}$ (Sink state)\n\nTherefore, the minimal deterministic finite-state automaton that recognizes this language has 5 states."
