    "This problem requires us to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a specific surface code configuration. Let's break down the analysis step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding Surface Code and Logical Qubits:**\n    A surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code where physical qubits are arranged on a 2D surface. The number of logical qubits it can encode depends entirely on the topology of this surface (i.e., its shape, including handles and holes/boundaries).\n\n2.  **The Formula for Logical Qubits:**\n    For a single, connected surface with genus `g` (number of \"handles\" or \"donuts\") and `b` boundaries (number of distinct edges, including outer edges and holes), the number of logical qubits `k` is given by:\n    `k = 2g + b - 1`\n\n    When we have multiple disconnected surfaces (or \"patches\"), the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits on each individual patch. Let's say we have `c` disconnected patches. The total number of logical qubits `k_total` can be found with a more general formula:\n    `k_total = 2*g_total + b_total - c`\n    where `g_total` is the sum of the genera of all patches, and `b_total` is the sum of the boundaries of all patches.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Given Configuration:**\n    *   **Number of Patches (c):** We are given \"two patches of surface code\". These are disconnected from each other. So, the number of disconnected components is `c = 2`.\n    *   **Genus (g):** The patches are standard surface codes, which are topologically equivalent to flat planes or disks. A flat plane has a genus of 0 (no handles). Since we have two such patches, the total genus is `g_total = g₁ + g₂ = 0 + 0 = 0`.\n    *   **Boundaries (b):** A boundary is any edge of the code. This includes the outer perimeter of a patch and the perimeter of any holes cut inside it.\n        *   Each of the two patches has its own outer boundary. This gives us 2 outer boundaries.\n        *   We are told there is a total of \"two holes\". A hole is an internal boundary. This gives us 2 internal boundaries.\n        *   Therefore, the total number of boundaries is `b_total = (Number of outer boundaries) + (Number of inner boundaries) = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Total Number of Logical Qubits:**\n    Now we can use the general formula `k_total = 2*g_total + b_total - c` with the values we've determined:\n    *   `g_total = 0`\n    *   `b_total = 4`\n    *   `c = 2`\n\n    `k_total = 2*(0) + 4 - 2 = 2`\n\n    So, the total number of logical qubits is 2.\n\n### Verifying with Case Analysis\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider the different ways the two holes can be distributed across the two patches.\n\n*   **Case 1: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   **Patch 1:** It has 1 outer boundary and 1 hole (internal boundary). So, `b₁ = 2`. The genus is `g₁ = 0`.\n        *   `k₁ = 2*g₁ + b₁ - 1 = 2*0 + 2 - 1 = 1` logical qubit.\n    *   **Patch 2:** Identical to Patch 1. `b₂ = 2`, `g₂ = 0`.\n        *   `k₂ = 2*g₂ + b₂ - 1 = 2*0 + 2 - 1 = 1` logical qubit.\n    *   **Total:** `k_total = k₁ + k₂ = 1 + 1 = 2` logical qubits.\n\n*   **Case 2: Both holes are in one patch.**\n    *   **Patch 1 (with holes):** It has 1 outer boundary and 2 holes (internal boundaries). So, `b₁ = 3`. The genus is `g₁ = 0`.\n        *   `k₁ = 2*g₁ + b₁ - 1 = 2*0 + 3 - 1 = 2` logical qubits.\n    *   **Patch 2 (no holes):** It has only 1 outer boundary. So, `b₂ = 1`. The genus is `g₂ = 0`.\n        *   `k₂ = 2*g₂ + b₂ - 1 = 2*0 + 1 - 1 = 0` logical qubits. (A simple planar code with no holes cannot encode a qubit; it can be used as a memory for a single state, but it doesn't represent a qubit's degrees of freedom).\n    *   **Total:** `k_total = k₁ + k₂ = 2 + 0 = 2` logical qubits.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth possible arrangements of the two holes result in a total of 2 logical qubits. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   The number of logical qubits is a topological property. The size and shape of the lattice or the holes don't matter, only their existence and connectivity.\n*   Remember to count the outer perimeter of each patch as a boundary.\n*   The formula `k = 2g + b - 1` is for a single connected component. Using `k_total = Σ kᵢ` or the more general formula `k_total = 2g_total + b_total - c` is crucial for multi-patch systems.\n*   A hole is an internal boundary. The term \"boundary\" in the formula includes all boundaries, both internal and external.\n\n<<<2>>>"
