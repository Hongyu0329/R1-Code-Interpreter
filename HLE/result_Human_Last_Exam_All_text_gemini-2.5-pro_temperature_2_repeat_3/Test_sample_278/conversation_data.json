    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b \\sin t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The definition is piecewise, depending on the value of $t$:\n*   **Case 1:** For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $b=1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\sin t$.\n*   **Case 2:** For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Part of the Curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$)**\n*   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n*   We know that $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, so $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   As $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$, $\\sin t \\ge 0$. This means the curve only traces the upper half of the unit circle.\n*   Let's find the range of x and y coordinates for this part:\n    *   **x-range:** The maximum value of $\\cos t$ is 1 (at $t=0$) and the minimum is -1 (at $t=\\pi$). So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n    *   **y-range:** The maximum value of $\\sin t$ is 1 (at $t=\\pi/2$) and the minimum is 0 (at $t=0$ and $t=\\pi$). So, $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Part of the Curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$)**\n*   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n*   From these, we can write $\\cos t = x$ and $\\sin t = y/5$. Using the identity $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, we get $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$, or $x^2 + y^2/25 = 1$. This is the equation of a vertical ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 and a semi-major axis of 5.\n*   As $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\sin t \\le 0$. This means the curve only traces the lower half of the ellipse.\n*   Let's find the range of x and y coordinates for this part:\n    *   **x-range:** As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\cos t$ goes from -1 to 1. Since the interval is open, $x \\in (-1, 1)$.\n    *   **y-range:** For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin t$ ranges from 0 down to -1 (at $t=3\\pi/2$) and back up to 0. So, $\\sin t \\in [-1, 0)$. Consequently, $y = 5\\sin t$ is in the range $[-5, 0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find its overall dimensions (the \"bounding box\"). We do this by combining the ranges from both parts.\n*   **Overall x-range:** The union of $[-1, 1]$ (from the first part) and $(-1, 1)$ (from the second part) is $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   Minimum x-value: $x_{min} = -1$.\n    *   Maximum x-value: $x_{max} = 1$.\n*   **Overall y-range:** The union of $[0, 1]$ (from the first part) and $[-5, 0)$ (from the second part) is $[-5, 1]$.\n    *   Minimum y-value: $y_{min} = -5$.\n    *   Maximum y-value: $y_{max} = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Dimensions of the Figure**\n*   **Width:** The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Height:** The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Find the Side Length and Area of the Smallest Enclosing Square**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of size 2 units by 6 units. The \"smallest square that outcircles the figure\" is the smallest axis-aligned square that the figure can fit inside. The side length of such a square must be at least as large as both the width and the height of the figure.\n*   Side length of the square, $S = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n*   The smallest enclosing square has a side length of 6.\n*   The area of this square is $A = S^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The parameter `b` changes, so the curve is composed of two different sections (a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse).\n2.  The extrema for x and y must be found by considering the entire curve, not just the individual parts in isolation.\n3.  The term \"outcircles\" in this context is interpreted as finding the smallest axis-aligned enclosing square, whose side is determined by the larger of the figure's total width and height.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe figure's total span on the x-axis is from -1 to 1 (a width of 2).\nThe figure's total span on the y-axis is from -5 to 1 (a height of 6).\nTo enclose this $2 \\times 6$ shape, a square needs a side length of at least 6.\nThe area of the smallest such square is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
