    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for the specific year when an individual named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Individuals:** The name in the question appears to merge two very prominent figures in Nigerian history:\n    *   **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan:** The former President of Nigeria, who served from 2010 to 2015. His known and official full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n    *   **Nnamdi Azikiwe:** A leading figure of Nigerian nationalism and the first President of Nigeria (a ceremonial role) from 1963 to 1966. His surname is Azikiwe, and he was popularly known as \"Zik\".\n\n3.  **Verify the Name:** The core of the issue lies in the name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". A thorough check of official records, biographical information, and news archives confirms that Goodluck Jonathan's full name does not include \"Azikiwe\". It is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n4.  **Investigate the Claim:** The next step is to search for any instance where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan might have adopted the name \"Azikiwe\" or publicly identified with it. This would have been a significant political statement. Extensive searches of public records, speeches, official documents, and news reports show no evidence of him ever doing so.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The premise of the question is based on incorrect information. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never officially or publicly used the name \"Azikiwe\" as part of his own name. Therefore, there is no year in which he publicly identified himself as \"azikiwe\".\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** It is crucial to verify the full and correct names of public figures, as inaccuracies can lead to flawed questions. The name provided in the query is a conflation of two different people.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The answer is based on the lack of any credible evidence that this event ever occurred. In historical or factual queries, a lack of evidence from reliable sources is a strong indicator that the event did not happen.\n*   **Distinguishing Figures:** It is important to differentiate between Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe, as they are distinct historical figures from different eras of Nigerian politics.\n\n<<<Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. The question is based on a false premise, as \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name.>>>"
