    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the variety X:**\n    The space $X$ is the 15th symmetric power, $C^{(15)}$, of a genus $g=3$ Riemann surface $C$. A point in $X$ is an unordered collection of 15 points on $C$. $X$ is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n\n2.  **Relate X to the Jacobian of C:**\n    For a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a $g$-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. There is a canonical map called the Abel-Jacobi map. For a symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ of degree $d$, there is a natural map $u: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ defined by sending an effective divisor $D = p_1 + \\dots + p_d$ to the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D - d \\cdot p_0)$, where $p_0$ is a fixed base point.\n    When $d \\ge g$, this map $u: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ is a fiber bundle. The fibers are all isomorphic to the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{d-g}$.\n    In our case, $d=15$ and $g=3$. Since $15 \\ge 3$, $X = C^{(15)}$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian $J(C)$ with fiber $\\mathbb{P}^{15-3} = \\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\n\n3.  **Decompose the Néron-Severi group of X:**\n    The Néron-Severi group $NS(X)$ is the group of divisor classes on $X$ modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank is denoted $\\rho(X)$.\n    For a projective bundle $p: E \\to B$ like ours, where $E=C^{(d)}$ and $B=J(C)$, the structure of the Picard group (and hence the Néron-Severi group) is well-understood. For $d \\ge g+1$, there is an isomorphism:\n    $NS(C^{(d)}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong (NS(J(C)) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Q} \\cdot \\zeta)$\n    where $\\zeta$ is the class of the relative hyperplane bundle for the $\\mathbb{P}^{d-g}$ fibration.\n    In our case, $d=15$ and $g=3$, so the condition $15 \\ge 3+1=4$ is satisfied. This means the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X$ decomposes as:\n    $\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ as $C$ varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n4.  **Determine the theoretical bounds for $\\rho(J(C))$:**\n    For any projective abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$, its Néron-Severi rank $\\rho(A)$ is bounded.\n    The upper bound is given by the dimension of the space of Hodge classes of type (1,1), denoted $h^{1,1}(A)$. For an abelian variety of dimension $g$, $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$.\n    The lower bound is 1, as any projective variety has at least one ample divisor class, which is non-trivial in the Néron-Severi group. $J(C)$ is principally polarized, so it naturally has such a class (the theta divisor).\n    For $A=J(C)$ with $g=3$, we have $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\n5.  **Find the smallest possible rank:**\n    The smallest possible rank is achieved for a \"very general\" curve $C$.\n    A very general curve in the moduli space of genus 3 curves, $\\mathcal{M}_3$, has a Jacobian $J(C)$ which is a simple abelian variety whose endomorphism ring is just $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    For such a Jacobian, the only algebraic cycles (up to rational multiples) that exist regardless of the specific choice of the curve are the ones coming from the principal polarization. The Néron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is generated by the class of the theta divisor, so $NS(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Thus, for a very general curve $C$, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n    This implies that the smallest possible rank for $X$ is:\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho(J(C))_{min} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n6.  **Find the largest possible rank:**\n    The largest possible rank is achieved for a very special curve $C$. The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ can reach its theoretical maximum of $h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 9$ if every Hodge class of type (1,1) on $J(C)$ is an algebraic class.\n    This property holds for abelian varieties with Complex Multiplication (CM). An abelian variety is of CM-type if its endomorphism algebra is sufficiently large.\n    It is a known result in arithmetic geometry that for any genus $g$, there exist curves $C$ whose Jacobians $J(C)$ are of CM-type. Such curves correspond to special points (CM points) in the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_g$.\n    So, we can find a genus 3 curve $C$ such that $J(C)$ has Complex Multiplication. For this curve, we have $\\rho(J(C)) = h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 9$.\n    This implies that the largest possible rank for $X$ is:\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho(J(C))_{max} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Dependence on d:** The structure of $X=C^{(d)}$ as a $\\mathbb{P}^{d-g}$-bundle over $J(C)$ and the simple decomposition of its Néron-Severi group rank rely on the condition $d \\ge g$. For smaller $d$, the geometry and the cohomology are more complicated. Our case $d=15$ is well into this \"stable\" range.\n*   **\"General\" vs. \"Special\" Curves:** The rank of the Néron-Severi group is not constant over the moduli space of curves. It is a semi-continuous function that can jump up on special subvarieties. The minimum value is attained on a dense open set (for \"general\" curves), while the maximum is attained on specific points or subvarieties (for \"special\" curves like CM curves).\n*   **Existence of CM Curves:** The argument for the maximum rank hinges on the existence of a genus 3 curve with a CM Jacobian. This is a non-trivial fact from the theory of Shimura varieties.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2.\nThe largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
