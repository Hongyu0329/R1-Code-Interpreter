    "An analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group and the question.**\nThe group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. A semidihedral group of order `2^n` (for `n >= 4`) is denoted as `SD_{2^n}`. In this case, the order is `512 = 2^9`, so we have `n=9`. The group is `G = SD_{512}`.\nThe presentation of `SD_{2^n}` is given by:\n`G = <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2) - 1)>`\nFor `n=9`, this becomes:\n`G = <r, s | r^256 = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>`\nThe elements of `G` are `{r^i, sr^i | 0 <= i < 256}`. The order of `G` is `|G| = 2 * 256 = 512`.\nThe question asks for the number of \"power subgroups\". A subgroup `H` of `G` is a power subgroup if there exists an integer `m` such that `H` is equal to the set `G^m = {g^m | g in G}`.\n\nA key property, which we will use, is that for any semidihedral group `G`, the set `G^m` is always a subgroup of `G`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of G^m.**\nWe need to compute the set `G^m` by raising every element `g \\in G` to the power `m`. There are two types of elements in `G`.\n\n*   **Elements of the form `r^i`:**\n    `(r^i)^m = r^{im}`. The set of these elements for `i = 0, ..., 255` forms the subgroup `(<r>)^m = <r^{gcd(m, 256)}>`.\n\n*   **Elements of the form `sr^i`:**\n    We first need to compute `(sr^i)^2`.\n    Using the relation `srs = r^k` with `k=127`, we have `sr = r^k s`. A more general relation is `sr^i = r^{ik'}s` which is not simple.\n    Instead, we use `s r s^(-1) = srs = r^127`. This means `s r^i s = (srs)^i` is not true, but `s r s` acts as an automorphism on `<r>`. The correct relation is `s r^i s = r^{i \\cdot (2^{n-2}-1)}`.\n    `(sr^i)^2 = sr^i sr^i = s(r^i s r^i) = s(s r^{i(2^{n-2}-1)} r^i) = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1) + i} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}`.\n    For `G = SD_{512}`, `n=9`, so `(sr^i)^2 = r^{i \\cdot 2^7} = r^{128i}`.\n\nNow, we can compute `(sr^i)^m`. We need to consider two cases for `m`.\n\n**Case A: `m` is odd.**\nLet `m = 2k + 1` for some integer `k`.\n*   `g = r^i`: The set `{(r^i)^m}` generates `<r^{gcd(m, 256)}>`. Since `m` is odd, `gcd(m, 256) = 1`. Thus, this set is `<r>`, the entire cyclic subgroup of order 256.\n*   `g = s`: `s^m = s^{2k+1} = (s^2)^k s = s`.\nSince `G^m` must be a subgroup, and it contains `<r>` and `s`, it must contain the subgroup generated by `<r>` and `s`, which is the entire group `G`.\nSo, for any odd integer `m`, `G^m = G`. This gives us our first power subgroup.\n*   **Power Subgroup 1: `G`**\n\n**Case B: `m` is even.**\nLet `m = 2k` for some integer `k \\ge 1`.\nIn this case, all elements in `G^m` will be powers of `r`.\n*   `(r^i)^m = r^{im}`. This is a power of `r`.\n*   `(sr^i)^m = (sr^i)^{2k} = ((sr^i)^2)^k = (r^{128i})^k = r^{128ik}`. This is also a power of `r`.\nThis means for any even `m`, `G^m` is a subgroup of `<r>`. The group `G^m` will be the subgroup generated by the union of `{(r^i)^m}` and `{(sr^i)^m}`.\n`G^m = <{(r^i)^m} \\cup {(sr^i)^m}> = <<r^{gcd(m, 256)}>, <r^{gcd(128k, 256)}>>`.\nThe subgroup generated by `<r^a>` and `<r^b>` is `<r^{gcd(a, b)}>`.\nSo, `G^m = <r^{gcd(gcd(m, 256), gcd(128k, 256))}>`.\nSince `k = m/2`, this simplifies to `G^m = <r^{gcd(m, 256, 128(m/2))}> = <r^{gcd(m, 64m, 256)}> = <r^{gcd(m, 256)}>`.\nLet's re-evaluate `gcd(128k, 256)`. Let `m = 2^j \\cdot t`, where `t` is odd and `j = v_2(m) \\ge 1`.\n`k = m/2 = 2^{j-1} t`.\nThe first generator is from `gcd(m, 256) = gcd(2^j t, 2^8) = 2^{min(j, 8)}`.\nThe second generator is from `gcd(128k, 256) = gcd(2^7 \\cdot 2^{j-1} t, 2^8) = gcd(2^{j+6} t, 2^8) = 2^{min(j+6, 8)}`.\nThe exponent `g` of the generator of `G^m` is `g = gcd(2^{min(j,8)}, 2^{min(j+6,8)})`.\n\nWe analyze the value of `g` based on `j = v_2(m)`:\n*   `j=1`: `g = gcd(2^{min(1,8)}, 2^{min(7,8)}) = gcd(2^1, 2^7) = 2`. So, `G^m = <r^2>`. This gives one subgroup for all `m` where `v_2(m)=1`.\n    *   **Power Subgroup 2: `<r^2>`**\n*   `j=2`: `g = gcd(2^{min(2,8)}, 2^{min(8,8)}) = gcd(2^2, 2^8) = 4`. So, `G^m = <r^4>`.\n    *   **Power Subgroup 3: `<r^4>`**\n*   `j=3`: `g = gcd(2^{min(3,8)}, 2^{min(9,8)}) = gcd(2^3, 2^8) = 8`. So, `G^m = <r^8>`.\n    *   **Power Subgroup 4: `<r^8>`**\n*   `j=4`: `g = gcd(2^{min(4,8)}, 2^{min(10,8)}) = gcd(2^4, 2^8) = 16`. So, `G^m = <r^16>`.\n    *   **Power Subgroup 5: `<r^16>`**\n*   `j=5`: `g = gcd(2^{min(5,8)}, 2^{min(11,8)}) = gcd(2^5, 2^8) = 32`. So, `G^m = <r^32>`.\n    *   **Power Subgroup 6: `<r^32>`**\n*   `j=6`: `g = gcd(2^{min(6,8)}, 2^{min(12,8)}) = gcd(2^6, 2^8) = 64`. So, `G^m = <r^64>`.\n    *   **Power Subgroup 7: `<r^64>`**\n*   `j=7`: `g = gcd(2^{min(7,8)}, 2^{min(13,8)}) = gcd(2^7, 2^8) = 128`. So, `G^m = <r^128>`. This is the center `Z(G)`.\n    *   **Power Subgroup 8: `<r^128>`**\n*   `j >= 8`: `min(j,8) = 8`. `min(j+6, 8) = 8`. `g = gcd(2^8, 2^8) = 256`. So, `G^m = <r^256> = {1}` (the trivial subgroup).\n    *   **Power Subgroup 9: `<r^256> = {1}`**\n\n**Step 3: Count the distinct power subgroups.**\nBy analyzing all possible values of `m` (classified by `v_2(m)`), we have found the following distinct power subgroups:\n1.  `G` (for `m` odd)\n2.  `<r^2>` (for `v_2(m)=1`)\n3.  `<r^4>` (for `v_2(m)=2`)\n4.  `<r^8>` (for `v_2(m)=3`)\n5.  `<r^16>` (for `v_2(m)=4`)\n6.  `<r^32>` (for `v_2(m)=5`)\n7.  `<r^64>` (for `v_2(m)=6`)\n8.  `<r^128>` (for `v_2(m)=7`)\n9.  `{1}` (the trivial subgroup, for `v_2(m) >= 8`)\n\nThese are 9 distinct subgroups. The group `G` has order 512. The other 8 subgroups are cyclic subgroups of `<r>` with orders 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, respectively. They are all distinct from each other and from `G`.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\nThe general formula for the number of power subgroups in `SD_{2^n}` is `n`. For `SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}`, `n=9`, so the number is 9."
