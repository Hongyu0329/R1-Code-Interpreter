    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific \"conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues to identify it:\n    *   It is discussed by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   Braudel's discussion involves a quote from another writer, Paul Morand.\n    *   The core idea is that this entity should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   A \"nation\" is given as an example or symbol of this entity.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The core of the question lies in finding the specific passage where Fernand Braudel quotes Paul Morand. This is a well-known quote used by Braudel to explain one of his fundamental concepts. The quote appears in his works, most notably in the preface or introduction to *A History of Civilizations* (also published as *Grammar of Civilizations*).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Quote:** Let's examine the quote in its context. Braudel introduces his subject by stating, \"To my mind, a **civilization** is a space, a 'cultural area'...\" He then uses the quote from Paul Morand to elaborate on this definition. Morand's text says:\n    > \"a **civilization**, being the face assumed by a nation, by a group of nations, by an entire continent... should be capable of being inscribed within the confines of a sphere which one could define with two poles and an equator.\"\n\n4.  **Identify the Entity:** The text from both Braudel and Morand explicitly names the conceptual entity. Braudel uses the quote to define what he means by \"civilization.\" Morand's quote itself begins with the phrase \"a civilization...\" and then describes it. The entity that is metaphorically inscribed within a sphere is, therefore, a **civilization**.\n\n5.  **Address the \"Careful Points\":**\n    *   **The Role of the Nation:** The question correctly notes that a nation is an *example* or *symbol* of this entity. Morand's quote clarifies this relationship: a civilization is the \"face assumed by a nation, a group of nations, or an entire continent.\" This means a nation is a unit that can express or form a civilization, but the larger conceptual entity itself is the civilization. One must not confuse the example (nation) with the concept being exemplified (civilization).\n    *   **The \"Sphere\" Metaphor:** This metaphor is used to suggest that a civilization is a self-contained, though not entirely closed, world. It has its own internal structure (poles, equator), continuities, and boundaries that define it as a cohesive whole in space and time.\n    *   **Attribution:** The question correctly attributes the quote to Morand and its emphasis to Braudel. Braudel adopted Morand's vivid imagery to explain his own analytical framework for studying long-term historical structures.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracing the quote from Paul Morand as used by Fernand Braudel, we can directly identify the \"conceptual entity\" in question. Braudel uses the quote precisely to define this term, and the quote itself names the term explicitly at its beginning.\n\n***\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
