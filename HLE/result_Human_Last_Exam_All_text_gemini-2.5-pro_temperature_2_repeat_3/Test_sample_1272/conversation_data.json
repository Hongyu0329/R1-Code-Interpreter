    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and events.**\nThe question asks about the location of the \"first major defeat\" of the Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (沐晟) in Vietnam. We need to identify this specific battle and then locate it on a modern map of Vietnam.\n\n**Step 2: Research Mu Sheng's military campaigns in Vietnam.**\nMu Sheng was involved in two main phases of Ming intervention in Vietnam:\n1.  The initial invasion from 1406-1407, which was largely successful and resulted in the establishment of Ming rule over Jiaozhi (Giao Chỉ) province. During this campaign, Mu Sheng, alongside his co-commander Zhang Fu, did not suffer any defeat that could be characterized as \"major.\"\n2.  The subsequent campaigns against the Lam Sơn Uprising led by Lê Lợi, which lasted from 1418 to 1427. It was during this conflict that the Ming forces suffered several significant defeats.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint Mu Sheng's \"first major defeat\".**\nThroughout the early and mid-stages of the Lam Sơn Uprising, the Ming forces experienced setbacks, but the most catastrophic defeats occurred in the final years (1426-1427). A key event was the Ming decision in 1427 to send two massive relief armies to crush the rebellion once and for all.\n*   One army, led by Liu Sheng, came from Guangxi.\n*   The other army, led by **Mu Sheng**, advanced from Yunnan.\n\nLiu Sheng's army was ambushed and annihilated first at the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang. Upon hearing this disastrous news, Mu Sheng's army, which had advanced into Vietnam, lost its morale. The Vietnamese forces, commanded by generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, seized the opportunity to attack Mu Sheng's demoralized troops.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific battle and its location.**\nThe decisive engagement against Mu Sheng's forces occurred at **Lãnh Câu** (冷溝) and **Đan Xá** (丹舍). Here, Mu Sheng's army was attacked, broken, and forced into a chaotic retreat back to Yunnan. This rout of his entire army was his most significant personal defeat in the war and can be confidently identified as his first truly \"major\" one as a commanding general in this conflict.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the modern-day province for the battle location.**\nHistorical sources and maps place the battlefields of Lãnh Câu and the subsequent pursuit along the Chảy River (Sông Chảy). This area corresponds to the territory of the modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province** in northern Vietnam.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGeneral Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred in 1427 at the Battle of Lãnh Câu. This historical location is situated within the present-day Tuyên Quang Province of Vietnam.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
