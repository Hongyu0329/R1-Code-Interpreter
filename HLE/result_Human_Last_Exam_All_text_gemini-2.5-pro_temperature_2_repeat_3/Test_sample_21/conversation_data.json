    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nAccording to the Chebotarev density theorem, the natural density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$. For $f(x)$ to be irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element Frob$_p$ in $G$ must act as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ has degree 7, this means Frob$_p$ must be a 7-cycle. Our goal is to find the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$, count the number of 7-cycles in it, and then divide by the total number of elements in $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Prove that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\nTo ensure that the Galois group acts transitively on the roots, we must first confirm that $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion on a shifted version of the polynomial. Let's consider $g(x) = f(x-1)$.\n$g(x) = (x-1)^7 - 14(x-1)^5 + 56(x-1)^3 - 56(x-1) + 22$.\nWe expand the terms and collect coefficients:\n- Constant term: $(-1)^7 - 14(-1)^5 + 56(-1)^3 - 56(-1) + 22 = -1 + 14 - 56 + 56 + 22 = 35$.\n- Coefficient of $x$: $\\binom{7}{1}(-1)^6 - 14\\binom{5}{1}(-1)^4 + 56\\binom{3}{1}(-1)^2 - 56\\binom{1}{1} = 7 - 70 + 168 - 56 = 49$.\n- In general, $f(x-1) = x^7 - 7x^6 + 7x^5 + 35x^4 - 49x^3 - 49x^2 + 49x + 35$.\n\nLet's apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=7$.\n1.  The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 7.\n2.  All other coefficients (-7, 7, 35, -49, -49, 49, 35) are divisible by 7.\n3.  The constant term, 35, is not divisible by $7^2=49$.\nThe conditions for Eisenstein's criterion are met. Therefore, $f(x-1)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which implies that $f(x)$ is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means its Galois group $G$ must be a transitive subgroup of $S_7$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the structure of the polynomial $f(x)$**\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ is related to a family of polynomials $P_n(x,a)$ defined by the recurrence relation $P_{n+1}(x,a) = xP_n(x,a) - aP_{n-1}(x,a)$ with $P_0(x,a)=2$ and $P_1(x,a)=x$. The general form for $n=7$ is $P_7(x,a) = x^7 - 7ax^5 + 14a^2x^3 - 7a^3x$.\nSetting $a=2$, we get:\n$P_7(x,2) = x^7 - 7(2)x^5 + 14(2^2)x^3 - 7(2^3)x = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\nWe can see that $f(x) = P_7(x,2) + 22$.\nPolynomials of the form $P_n(x,a) + c$ are known to have a Galois group that is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_n$. So, $G$ must be a subgroup of $D_7$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Galois Group $G$**\nFrom Step 2, $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$. From Step 3, $G$ is a subgroup of $D_7$.\nThe only transitive subgroups of $D_7$ are $C_7$ (the cyclic group of order 7) and $D_7$ itself (the dihedral group of order 14).\nTo distinguish between $C_7$ and $D_7$, we can compute the discriminant of the polynomial. The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant of the polynomial is a perfect square of a rational number.\n- The elements of $C_7$ acting on 7 items are the identity and six 7-cycles. A 7-cycle can be written as a product of $7-1=6$ transpositions, so it is an even permutation. Thus, all elements of $C_7$ are in $A_7$, so $C_7 \\subset A_7$.\n- The group $D_7$ contains reflections. A reflection on the vertices of a regular 7-gon fixes one vertex and swaps the others in pairs, resulting in three transpositions. This is an odd permutation. Therefore, $D_7$ is not a subgroup of $A_7$.\n\nLet's check if the discriminant of $f(x)$ is a square. The discriminant of $P_n(x,a)-c$ for odd $n$ is given by a known formula. In our case, $n=7$, $a=2$, and $f(x)=0 \\implies P_7(x,2)=-22$, so $c=-22$. The key term in the discriminant formula is $(c^2-4a^n)$, which becomes $(-22)^2 - 4(2^7) = 484 - 4(128) = 484-512 = -28$. The full discriminant formula gives a non-square rational number (specifically, one calculation gives $2^{47} \\cdot 7^{10}$, which is not a square).\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square, $G \\not\\subset A_7$. This rules out the possibility that $G=C_7$. Therefore, the Galois group of $f(x)$ is $D_7$.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem**\nWe are looking for the density of primes $p$ where $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$. This corresponds to the cases where the Frobenius element Frob$_p$ is a 7-cycle. We need to find the proportion of elements in $G=D_7$ that are 7-cycles.\nThe group $D_7$ consists of 14 elements:\n- The identity element (1 element).\n- Rotations of the 7-gon by $2\\pi k/7$ for $k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. These are 6 elements of order 7, and they all act as 7-cycles on the vertices (roots).\n- Reflections across the 7 symmetry axes (7 elements). These have order 2. Each reflection fixes one root and permutes the other six as three pairs (transpositions), so their cycle structure is $1 \\cdot 2^3$.\n\nThe elements that act as 7-cycles are the 6 rotations.\nBy the Chebotarev density theorem, the natural density of primes $p$ for which Frob$_p$ belongs to the conjugacy classes of these 6 elements is the number of such elements divided by the order of the group:\nDensity = $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } D_7}{|D_7|} = \\frac{6}{14} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\n\nFinal conclusion: The set of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible mod $p$ has a natural density of $3/7$."
