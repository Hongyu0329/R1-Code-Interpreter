    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Flag and the Matrix**\n\n1.  **Flag of Tonga:** The flag has a red field (background) with a white canton (a rectangle in the top-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red \"couped\" cross. A couped cross does not extend to the edges of the canton.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** We create a matrix `M` from an image of the flag. Let the image have dimensions `m \\times n` pixels.\n    *   Red pixels are assigned the value `a`.\n    *   White pixels are assigned the value `b`.\n    *   The problem asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the values of `a` and `b`, and the dimensions and proportions of the flag's features to maximize the rank.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Matrix using its Block Structure**\n\nLet the white canton have dimensions `k \\times l`. The matrix `M` can be represented as a block matrix:\n\nM =  $\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{C} & \\mathbf{R}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{R}_2 & \\mathbf{R}_3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWhere:\n*   `C` is the `k \\times l` submatrix corresponding to the canton. Its entries are `a` for the red cross and `b` for the white background.\n*   `R1`, `R2`, `R3` are submatrices corresponding to the red field. All of their entries are `a`. A matrix where all entries are the same has a rank of 1 (if `a \\neq 0`) or 0 (if `a = 0`).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Matrix using Row Operations**\n\nThe rank of a matrix is unchanged by elementary row and column operations. To find the rank of `M`, we can simplify it. Let's assume `a \\neq 0` to avoid trivial cases (if `a=0`, the rank is lower).\n\n1.  The last `m-k` rows of `M` correspond to the bottom part of the red field. All of these rows are identical vectors of the form `(a, a, ..., a)`.\n2.  Take the last row of `M` and subtract it from all other `m-1` rows.\n    *   For rows `i` from `k+1` to `m-1`, the new row will be `(a, a, ...) - (a, a, ...) = (0, 0, ...)`. These rows become all zeros.\n    *   For rows `i` from `1` to `k` (the canton rows), the original row `i` is `(C_{i1}, C_{i2}, ..., C_{il}, a, a, ..., a)`. Subtracting the last row gives `(C_{i1}-a, C_{i2}-a, ..., C_{il}-a, 0, 0, ..., 0)`.\n3.  The resulting matrix, `M'`, has the following structure:\n    *   A `k \\times l` block at the top-left, which we'll call `C'`. Its entries are `C_{ij}-a`.\n    *   A `k \\times (n-l)` block of zeros to its right.\n    *   `m-k-1` rows of all zeros.\n    *   The last row remains `(a, a, ..., a)`.\n\nThe rank of `M` is the rank of `M'`. The `k` rows at the top of `M'` have non-zero entries only in the first `l` columns. The last row has non-zero entries (value `a`) in all columns (assuming `a \\neq 0`). Therefore, the last row is linearly independent of the first `k` rows. The rank is the sum of the rank from the top `k` rows and the rank from the last row (+1).\n\nrank(M) = rank(top `k` rows of `M'`) + 1 = rank( `C'` ) + 1\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Rank of the Canton Block `C'`**\n\nLet's examine the matrix `C' = C - aJ`, where `J` is a `k \\times l` matrix of all ones.\n*   For white pixels in the canton, `C_{ij} = b`. The new entry is `C'_{ij} = b - a`.\n*   For red pixels (the cross) in the canton, `C_{ij} = a`. The new entry is `C'_{ij} = a - a = 0`.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose `a \\neq b`, so `d = b-a \\neq 0`.\n`C'` is a matrix where the background is a constant `d`, and the shape of the cross is filled with zeros.\nLet `P` be the `k \\times l` indicator matrix for the cross (1 for red, 0 for white). Then `C'` is `d \\cdot (J - P)`.\nSince `d \\neq 0`, rank(`C'`) = rank(`J - P`).\n\n**Step 5: Maximize the Rank of `J - P` by Designing the Cross `P`**\n\nThe rank of `J - P` depends on the structure of the rows of `P`. A cross is formed by the union of a horizontal rectangle and a vertical rectangle. Let's analyze the types of rows (`p_i`) that can appear in `P`.\n*   Let `H` be the set of row indices for the horizontal bar of the cross, and `W_h` be its column indices.\n*   Let `V` be the set of row indices for the vertical bar, and `W_v` be its column indices.\nThe row `p_i` is a vector representing the `i`-th slice of the cross.\n1.  If row `i` is outside the cross entirely (`i \\notin H \\cup V`): `p_i` is the zero vector `0`.\n2.  If row `i` is only in the horizontal bar (`i \\in H` but `i \\notin V`): `p_i` is a vector with ones in columns `W_h`. Let's call this `r_h`.\n3.  If row `i` is only in the vertical bar (`i \\in V` but `i \\notin H`): `p_i` is a vector with ones in columns `W_v`. Let's call this `r_v`.\n4.  If row `i` is in the intersection (`i \\in H \\cap V`): `p_i` is a vector with ones in columns `W_h \\cup W_v`. Let's call this `r_{full}`.\n\nFor a general cross, we can have all four types of rows. The rows of `J-P` will be `j-p_i`, where `j` is the all-ones vector. The distinct row types in `J-P` will be:\n`j - 0 = j`\n`j - r_h`\n`j - r_v`\n`j - r_{full}`\n\nThe rank of `J-P` is the dimension of the space spanned by these four vectors. Let's check if they can be linearly independent.\n`c_1 j + c_2 (j - r_h) + c_3 (j - r_v) + c_4 (j - r_{full}) = 0`\n`(c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4)j - c_2 r_h - c_3 r_v - c_4 r_{full} = 0`\n\nThe cross is \"couped\", meaning it doesn't touch the edges of the canton. This implies that the first and last columns of `P` can be all zeros. Therefore, `r_h`, `r_v`, and `r_{full}` will have zeros in the first and last position. The vector `j`, however, has ones everywhere.\nIn the equation above, the vector `c_2 r_h + c_3 r_v + c_4 r_{full}` must have zeros in the first and last position, but `(c_1 + ... + c_4)j` is constant. This forces `c_1 + ... + c_4 = 0`.\nThe equation simplifies to `c_2 r_h + c_3 r_v + c_4 r_{full} = 0`.\nCan we make `r_h`, `r_v`, `r_{full}` linearly independent? Yes, by choosing the sets `W_h` and `W_v` appropriately. For instance, in a canton of width `l=5`, let `W_h = {2,3}` and `W_v = {3,4}`.\n*   `r_h = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0)`\n*   `r_v = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0)`\n*   `r_{full} = (0, 1, 1, 1, 0)`\nThese three vectors are linearly independent. This implies that `c_2 = c_3 = c_4 = 0`. Since `c_1+c_2+c_3+c_4=0`, we also get `c_1=0`.\nThus, the four vector types `j, j-r_h, j-r_v, j-r_{full}` are linearly independent.\nBy designing a flag image with a sufficiently large canton (`k \\ge 4, l \\ge 5`) and a cross that produces these four row types, we can make `rank(J-P) = 4`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Maximal Rank**\n\nWe found that the maximum possible rank for `C'` (which is `rank(J-P)`) is 4.\nPlugging this back into our formula for the rank of `M`:\nrank(M) = rank(`C'`) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis is the maximal possible rank, achieved by selecting `a \\neq b`, `a \\neq 0`, and designing a pixel-level representation of the flag that allows for the necessary linear independence.\n\n>>>5"
