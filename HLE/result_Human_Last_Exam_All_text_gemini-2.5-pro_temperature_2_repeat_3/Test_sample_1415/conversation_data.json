    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Define the functions\nFirst, let's explicitly write down each function based on the given definitions:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Integral\nThe problem asks to evaluate the definite integral:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integrand is of the form g'(x)/g(x), where g(x) = F₃(x). This is a standard integral form.\n\n### Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Standard Integral Form\nThe key to solving this problem efficiently is to recognize that the antiderivative of f'(x)/f(x) is ln|f(x)|.\nLet g(x) = F₃(x). Then g'(x) = F₃'(x). The integral becomes:\n∫ (g'(x)/g(x)) dx = ln|g(x)| + C\n\nWithout this recognition, calculating F₃'(x) and then attempting to integrate the resulting complex fraction would be extremely difficult.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\nUsing the antiderivative found in Step 2, we can evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] evaluated from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n### Careful Point 2: Checking the Domain and Sign of F₃(x)\nBefore we remove the absolute value signs, we must ensure that F₃(x) is not zero and is well-defined over the interval [0, 1].\n*   For x in [0, 1] (radians), we have 0 ≤ sin(x) ≤ sin(1).\n*   Since e^y is always positive, e^(sin(x)) is positive. In fact, e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1.\n*   Therefore, 1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2.\n*   The natural logarithm function, ln(z), is defined for z > 0. Since 1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2, the argument of the logarithm in F₃(x) is always positive.\n*   Furthermore, since 1 + e^(sin(x)) > 1, F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) will always be positive on the interval [0, 1].\n*   Conclusion: We can safely remove the absolute value bars.\n\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n\n### Step 4: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)\nNow we compute the values of F₃(x) at the limits of integration.\n\n**At x = 0:**\n*   sin(0) = 0\n*   e^(sin(0)) = e⁰ = 1\n*   F₃(0) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n**At x = 1:**\n*   sin(1) is the sine of 1 radian.\n*   e^(sin(1))\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n### Step 5: Substitute and Simplify the Expression for V\nSubstituting the values from Step 4 into our expression for V:\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we get:\nV = ln [ ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) ]\n\n### Step 6: Numerical Calculation\nNow we need to calculate the numerical value of V. We will use standard approximations.\n*   The value of 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees.\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.84147) ≈ 2.31978\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.31978 = 3.31978\n*   ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.31978) ≈ 1.19985\n    *   This is the value of F₃(1).\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.69315\n    *   This is the value of F₃(0).\n\nNow substitute these into the expression for V:\nV ≈ ln [ 1.19985 / 0.69315 ]\nV ≈ ln(1.73104)\nV ≈ 0.54871\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n*   10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54871 = 5487.1\n*   The closest integer to 5487.1 is 5487."
