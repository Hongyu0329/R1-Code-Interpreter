    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Novel and Main Character:** The novel in question is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Polish science fiction author Jacek Dukaj. The main character of the novel is Adam Zamoyski, a human from the 21st century who is resurrected in the far future.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Main Character's Relationships:** Throughout the story, Adam Zamoyski's primary and most significant relationship is with a post-human entity, an 'inc' (Incorporated being). This character guides him, protects him, and their bond is central to the plot.\n\n3.  **Identify the Partner:** This post-human character is named Angelina. She is an immensely powerful and complex being who takes a special interest in the resurrected Adam.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Marriage Event:** The climax of the novel's narrative arc for Adam Zamoyski involves his decision to fully integrate into the future world he finds himself in. This decision is symbolized and actualized by his union with Angelina. The novel explicitly describes this union as a marriage, solidifying their bond and Adam's new place in the universe.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Context of \"Marriage\":** It's important to note that the concept of \"marriage\" in the far-future, post-human setting of the novel is not identical to our contemporary understanding. It is a more profound and complex union, representing a merging of consciousness and existence, fitting for the technological and philosophical landscape of the story.\n*   **Protagonist's Name:** Correctly identifying the main character as Adam Zamoyski is crucial to finding information about his relationships.\n*   **Key Character:** Angelina is not a minor character; she is a central figure in the novel and the driving force behind many of the events that affect Adam.\n*   **Plot Culmination:** The marriage is a definitive event at the end of the novel, resolving Adam's character arc from a confused \"artifact\" to an integrated being making a conscious choice about his future.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the name of the character that Adam Zamoyski marries is Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
