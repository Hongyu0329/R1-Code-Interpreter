    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an explicit expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables (like matrices). The expansion is a series in terms of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$.\nThe formula is written as a sum of homogeneous terms of increasing degree (order):\n$Z = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\nwhere $Z_n(X,Y)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ in $X$ and $Y$.\nFor example:\n*   $Z_1 = X + Y$\n*   $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n*   $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [Y, X]]$\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**Step 2: Relate \"Terms\" and \"Coefficients\" to a Vector Space**\n\nThe terms in the BCH expansion of a specific order $n$ (like $[X, [X, Y]]$ for order 3) are not just arbitrary polynomials. They are special combinations called *Lie polynomials* and are constructed from nested commutators.\nFor a given order $n$, the set of all linearly independent Lie polynomials forms a basis for a vector space. This space is the $n$-th graded component of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements ($X$ and $Y$), denoted as $L_2(n)$.\nThe expression for $Z_n(X, Y)$ is an element (a vector) in this vector space. To write it down, we express it as a linear combination of the basis vectors:\n$Z_n = c_1 B_1 + c_2 B_2 + \\dots + c_m B_m$\nwhere $\\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_m\\}$ is a basis for $L_2(n)$ and $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$ are the corresponding coefficients. The dimension of this space is $m = \\dim(L_2(n))$.\n\n**Step 3: The Key Insight for Counting Non-Zero Coefficients**\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of non-zero coefficients\". This is the count of how many of the $c_i$ in the expression above are not equal to zero.\nA crucial property of the BCH formula is that the resulting element $Z_n$ is \"generic\". This means that when $Z_n$ is expressed in any standard basis for the space of Lie polynomials (such as a Hall basis or a Lyndon basis), all the coefficients $c_i$ turn out to be non-zero. There are no \"accidental\" cancellations that would make a coefficient for a particular basis element vanish.\nTherefore, the number of non-zero coefficients of order $n$ is equal to the total number of basis elements needed to span the space, which is the dimension of the vector space $L_2(n)$.\n\n**Step 4: Use Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the space $L_k(n)$ (the $n$-th component of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators) is given by Witt's formula:\n$$l_k(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$$\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the order (degree).\n*   $k$ is the number of generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**The Möbius Function $\\mu(d)$**\nThe Möbius function is defined as:\n*   $\\mu(d) = 1$ if $d$ is a square-free positive integer with an even number of distinct prime factors.\n*   $\\mu(d) = -1$ if $d$ is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of distinct prime factors.\n*   $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Formula to the Specific Case (Order 10)**\n\nWe need to find the number of non-zero coefficients of order **n = 10**. The expansion involves two generators, **k = 2** ($X$ and $Y$). We need to compute $l_2(10)$.\n\n1.  **Find the divisors of n = 10:**\n    The divisors are $d = \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$ (by convention, an even number (0) of prime factors).\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is prime; one prime factor).\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is prime; one prime factor).\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\times 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (two distinct prime factors).\n\n3.  **Substitute these values into Witt's formula:**\n    $l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d \\in \\{1,2,5,10\\}} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n    $l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10} \\right)$\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    $l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right)$\n    $l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2)$\n    $l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (990)$\n    $l_2(10) = 99$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of linearly independent commutators of order 10, and thus the number of non-zero coefficients in the BCH expansion at that order, is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
