No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial. It typically follows the Parker Spiral, forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the radial direction. The use of components perpendicular to the radial direction is justified by Taylor's "frozen-in flow" Hypothesis. Since the solar wind is highly super-Alfv√©nic, the spacecraft primarily samples the plasma structures as they are swept past radially. While this provides a projected measurement of helicity, it correctly preserves the sign of the helicity for waves propagating away from the Sun. As the sign determines the polarization (left or right), this common simplification is valid for the purpose of identifying wave modes like AIC waves.
