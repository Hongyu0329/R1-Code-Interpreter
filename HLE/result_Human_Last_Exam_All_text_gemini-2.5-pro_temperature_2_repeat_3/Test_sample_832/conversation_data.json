    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Request\n\nThe core task is to count a specific ballet step (`entrelacé`) performed in a specific scene, by a specific dancer, with a specific company, in a specific year.\n*   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n*   **Scene:** \"Death of Nikiya\" (Act II, Nikiya's solo variation)\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Performance:** Her debut as Nikiya\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2009\n*   **Step to Count:** `Entrelacé` (also known as `tour jeté entrelacé`)\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Specific Performance\n\nThe performance in question is Natalia Osipova's highly anticipated debut as Nikiya at the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009, partnered by Ivan Vasiliev as Solor. The \"Death of Nikiya\" scene is in Act II, where Nikiya dances a solo variation before being presented with a basket of flowers, which hides a venomous snake.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Ballet Step `Entrelacé`\n\nAn `entrelacé`, or `tour jeté entrelacé`, is a turning leap. A dancer typically begins with a `chassé` or `glissade` for preparation, followed by a `grand battement` (high kick) to the front. The dancer then leaps, turns 180 degrees in the air away from the kicking leg, and lands on the kicking leg, with the other leg finishing in an `arabesque`. It's a characteristic \"whipping\" or \"interlacing\" motion in the air.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation\n\nTo answer the question, we must watch the specified performance and count the steps.\n1.  The variation begins with Nikiya expressing her sadness and heartbreak through poignant poses and turns.\n2.  Following the introductory section, she begins her first allegro (jumping) sequence. This is where the `entrelacés` occur.\n3.  She performs a series of four powerful `entrelacés` traveling diagonally across the stage from upstage right to downstage left. Each one is clearly executed with the characteristic turn and landing in `arabesque`.\n4.  After this diagonal sequence, she does not perform any more `entrelacés`. The rest of her variation includes other steps such as `sissonnes`, `piqué` turns, and `chaîné` turns, before she tragically accepts the basket of flowers.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Correct Video:** It is essential to analyze the correct performance. Osipova's 2009 debut is well-documented and available to watch. Viewing a different performance or a different dancer could yield a different count.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** One must be careful not to misidentify the step. An `entrelacé` is distinct from a `grand jeté` (a straight leap) or a `fouetté sauté` (a different type of turning jump). In this choreography, the steps are clearly identifiable as `entrelacés`.\n*   **Standard Choreography:** The Grigorovich version of *La Bayadère* at the Bolshoi has fairly set choreography. The four diagonal `entrelacés` are a standard feature of this particular variation. Osipova's distinction lies in the exceptional power, height, and speed with which she executes them, not in changing the number of steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing the specific performance of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene, the count is precise. She performs exactly one sequence of this step.\n\nThe number of `entrelacés` performed is **4**.\n\n<<<4>>>"
