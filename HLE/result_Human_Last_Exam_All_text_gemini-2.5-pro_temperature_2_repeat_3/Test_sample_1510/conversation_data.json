    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Group:** A wallpaper group (or plane crystallographic group) is a group of geometric symmetries that describes a repeating two-dimensional pattern. There are a total of 17 distinct wallpaper groups.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, its corresponding point group is the set of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave a specific point fixed. The point group essentially captures the rotational and reflectional symmetry of the pattern, ignoring the translational aspect.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the total number of elements (i.e., distinct symmetry operations) it contains.\n\n**2. Identify the Possible 2D Crystallographic Point Groups**\n\nDue to the crystallographic restriction theorem, only certain rotational symmetries are compatible with a repeating lattice structure. This limits the possible point groups in two dimensions to the following 10 groups (listed with their standard notation and order):\n*   `1` (identity only) - Order 1\n*   `2` (180° rotation) - Order 2\n*   `3` (120° rotation) - Order 3\n*   `4` (90° rotation) - Order 4\n*   `6` (60° rotation) - Order 6\n*   `m` (reflection across a line) - Order 2\n*   `2mm` (180° rotation and two reflections) - Order 4\n*   `3m` (120° rotation and reflections) - Order 6\n*   `4mm` (90° rotation and reflections) - Order 8\n*   `6mm` (60° rotation and reflections) - Order 12\n\n**3. Find Point Groups of Order 2**\n\nFrom the list above, we can identify the point groups that have exactly two elements (order 2):\n*   **Point Group `2`:** Contains the identity and a 180° rotation.\n*   **Point Group `m`:** Contains the identity and a reflection.\n\nOur goal is to find all the wallpaper groups that correspond to one of these two point groups.\n\n**4. Examine the 17 Wallpaper Groups**\n\nWe will now go through the 17 wallpaper groups, often categorized by their crystal system, and identify their point group.\n\n*   **Oblique System (Point Groups: 1, 2)**\n    *   `p1`: Point group `1` (Order 1). This group only has translational symmetries.\n    *   `p2`: This group has centers of 2-fold rotation. Its point group is **`2` (Order 2)**. (Count: 1)\n\n*   **Rectangular System (Point Groups: m, 2mm)**\n    *   `pm`: This group has reflection lines. Its point group is **`m` (Order 2)**. (Count: 2)\n    *   `pg`: This group has glide-reflection lines. A glide reflection is a combination of a reflection and a translation. When determining the point group, the translational component is ignored, leaving just a reflection. Thus, its point group is **`m` (Order 2)**. (Count: 3)\n    *   `cm`: This group uses a centered rectangular lattice and has reflection lines. Its point group is **`m` (Order 2)**. (Count: 4)\n    *   The remaining groups in this system (`p2mm`, `p2mg`, `p2gg`, `c2mm`) all have the point group `2mm` (Order 4).\n\n*   **Square System (Point Groups: 4, 4mm)**\n    *   The wallpaper groups in this system (`p4`, `p4mm`, `p4gm`) have point groups of order 4 or 8. None have order 2.\n\n*   **Hexagonal System (Point Groups: 3, 3m, 6, 6mm)**\n    *   The wallpaper groups in this system (`p3`, `p3m1`, `p31m`, `p6`, `p6mm`) have point groups of order 3, 6, or 12. None have order 2.\n\n**5. Tally the Results**\n\nBy examining all 17 wallpaper groups, we found four groups whose point group has an order of 2:\n1.  **`p2`** (has point group `2`)\n2.  **`pm`** (has point group `m`)\n3.  **`pg`** (has point group `m`)\n4.  **`cm`** (has point group `m`)\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are a total of **4** wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
