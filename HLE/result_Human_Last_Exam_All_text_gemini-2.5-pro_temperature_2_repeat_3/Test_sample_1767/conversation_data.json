    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Components:**\n    *   **Chern Insulator:** A two-dimensional material that is an electrical insulator in its bulk but supports conducting states at its edges. It is a topological phase of matter characterized by an integer topological invariant called the Chern number.\n    *   **Chern Number (C):** The Chern number is a property of the bulk electronic band structure. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a non-zero Chern number C guarantees the existence of |C| chiral edge states at any boundary with a trivial insulator (like a vacuum or a C=0 material). The sign of C determines the direction of propagation (chirality) of these edge states.\n    *   **The Setup:** We have two Chern insulators, let's call them CI1 and CI2.\n        *   Chern number of CI1 is C₁ = 1.\n        *   Chern number of CI2 is C₂ = 1.\n    *   **The Junction:** The two insulators are connected \"laterally\", meaning they are placed side-by-side, forming an interface between them.\n    *   **The Interaction:** The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" implies that electrons (and thus the edge states) can move freely across the interface between CI1 and CI2.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Edge States at the Interface:**\n    *   Let's place CI1 on the left (x < 0) and CI2 on the right (x > 0). The interface is the line at x = 0.\n    *   The right edge of CI1 (at x=0) would host an edge state. Since C₁ = 1, this is a single chiral edge state. Let's say it propagates in the +y direction.\n    *   The left edge of CI2 (at x=0) would also host an edge state. Since C₂ = 1, this edge state must have the same chirality as the one from CI1. It also propagates in the +y direction.\n    *   Therefore, at the interface, we have two edge states propagating in the *same* direction (they are co-propagating).\n\n3.  **Determining the Fate of the Interface States:**\n    *   The condition \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is critical. It allows these two co-propagating edge states to interact and hybridize.\n    *   A key principle in topological physics is that only edge states with opposite chirality (counter-propagating) are topologically protected from gapping each other out.\n    *   When two or more edge states with the same chirality meet, they are not topologically protected from each other. They can mix, forming bonding and anti-bonding combinations. This interaction opens an energy gap in the spectrum of the interface states.\n    *   As a result, the interface between CI1 and CI2 becomes insulating (gapped).\n\n4.  **Calculating the Chern Number of the Composite System:**\n    *   The Chern number is an additive topological invariant. When two systems are joined, and their interface becomes gapped (topologically trivial), the Chern number of the new, combined system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n    *   The Chern number of the composite system (C_total) is given by:\n        C_total = C₁ + C₂\n    *   Substituting the given values:\n        C_total = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5.  **Final Physical Picture:**\n    *   The combined system is a new Chern insulator with a total Chern number of C_total = 2.\n    *   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, this new system will have |C_total| = 2 chiral edge states on its *outer* boundaries.\n    *   This is consistent with our initial picture: the original outer edge of CI1 and the original outer edge of CI2 now form the new outer boundary of the composite system, which will host two co-propagating chiral edge states. The interface between them has become gapped and is part of the new insulating bulk.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Chirality:** It is crucial to recognize that C=1 for both insulators implies their edge states have the *same* chirality. If one were C=-1, the states would be counter-propagating, and the conclusion would be different (the interface would remain a gapless 1D conductor).\n*   **Interaction:** The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is what allows the interface states to interact and gap out. If there were a large barrier, the two systems would remain effectively decoupled.\n*   **Additivity of Chern Number:** This principle applies when the interface that is formed becomes gapped. It's a fundamental rule for combining topological phases.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Junction\":** The question \"what is the Chern number of this junction\" refers to the Chern number of the entire composite material formed by joining the two insulators.\n\nThe final answer is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nC_total = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
