    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThe meter is an Iambic Senarius, a line of six iambic (`S L`) feet, common in Roman comedy (like Plautus, from whom this line comes). This meter allows for frequent substitutions.\n\n**1. Syllabification and Elision:**\nFirst, we must identify any elisions. The word `bene` ends in an `-e`, and the next word `esse` begins with an `e-`. This is a classic case for elision, where the first vowel is dropped. The line is scanned as if it were written:\n\"et tibi ben'esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\nNow let's break this into syllables:\n`et | ti | bi | be | nes | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\nThis gives us a total of 14 syllables, which suggests two feet in the line will have three syllables each (like an anapest or dactyl).\n\n**2. Determining Syllable Quantity (L for Long, S for Short):**\n\n*   **et**: The vowel `e` is naturally short, but it is followed by two consonants: the `t` at the end of `et` and the `t` at the beginning of `tibi`. This makes the syllable long by position. -> **L**\n*   **ti-bi**: Both `i`'s in `tibi` are naturally short. -> **S S**\n*   **be-nes-se** (from `ben'esse`):\n    *   `be-`: The `e` is short and followed by a single consonant (`n`). -> **S**\n    *   `nes-`: The `e` is short but followed by two consonants (`n` and `s`). This makes it long by position. -> **L**\n    *   `-se`: The final `e` of `esse` is naturally short. -> **S**\n*   **so-li**: From the adjective `solus`. The `o` is naturally long. The `-i` is a dative singular ending, which is also long. -> **L L**\n*   **quom**: An archaic spelling of `cum`. The vowel `o` is long. -> **L**\n*   **si-bi**: Both `i`'s in `sibi` are naturally short. -> **S S**\n*   **sit**: The `i` is naturally short, but it is followed by two consonants: the `t` at the end of `sit` and the `m` at the beginning of `male`. This makes the syllable long by position. -> **L**\n*   **ma-le**:\n    *   `ma-`: The `a` in `malus` (and its derivatives) is short. -> **S**\n    *   `-le`: The final `-e` is short, but as the last syllable of the line, it is considered long due to the principle of *brevis in longo* (\"a short syllable in a long position\"). -> **L**\n\n**3. Assembling the Sequence of Syllables:**\nPutting it all together, the sequence of long and short syllables is:\n`L S S S L S L L L S S L S L`\n\n**4. Dividing into Feet:**\nNow, we group this sequence into 6 feet, consistent with the rules of Iambic Senarius. The base foot is an Iamb (`S L`), but substitutions are allowed.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `L S S` -> A **Dactyl**, a valid substitution. (`et ti bi`)\n*   **Foot 2:** `S L` -> A standard **Iamb**. (`be nes-`)\n*   **Foot 3:** `S L` -> A standard **Iamb**. (`-se so-`)\n*   **Foot 4:** `L L` -> A **Spondee**, a valid substitution. (`-li quom`)\n*   **Foot 5:** `S S L` -> An **Anapest**, a valid substitution. (`si bi sit`)\n*   **Foot 6:** `S L` -> A standard **Iamb**. (`ma le`)\n\nThe complete scansion is a dactyl, followed by two iambs, a spondee, an anapest, and a final iamb. This is a perfectly acceptable pattern for a Plautine Iambic Senarius.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
