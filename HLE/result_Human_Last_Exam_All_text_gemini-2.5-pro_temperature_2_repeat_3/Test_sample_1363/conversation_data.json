    "Step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a dance from the given options where it is technically impossible to \"overturn\" a \"reverse turn\" without violating the core principles of that dance's technique.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A fundamental figure in ballroom dancing where the couple rotates to the left (counter-clockwise).\n    *   **Overturn:** To turn more than the standard or prescribed amount for a figure. For example, turning a full 360 degrees on a figure that is technically defined as a 270-degree (3/4) turn.\n    *   **Technique:** This refers to the specific, codified rules of a dance regarding footwork, alignment, rise and fall, sway, timing, and amount of turn for each figure. Violating the technique means performing an action that is fundamentally incorrect according to the established syllabus (e.g., ISTD, WDSF).\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Dance Option:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The Reverse Turn in Viennese Waltz is a continuous figure of 6 steps that completes one full 360-degree rotation. While the standard is a full turn, the continuous nature of the dance and the rotational momentum could allow for a slight \"over-rotation\" without a catastrophic breakdown of the figure. It might be poor form, but not strictly *impossible* in the way the question implies.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz:** The standard Reverse Turn in Waltz covers 3/4 of a turn (270 degrees) over 6 steps. However, an \"Overturned Reverse Turn\" is a very common and officially recognized variation where the turn is increased, often to a full 360 degrees. Since this is a named variation within the technique, it is clearly not impossible to do.\n\n    *   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Similar to the Waltz, the Reverse Turn in Foxtrot can be overturned. There are recognized syllabus variations such as the \"Overturned Reverse Turn with Feather Finish.\" The \"swing\" nature of the dance allows for momentum to be used to increase the amount of rotation. Therefore, it is not impossible.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** Quickstep is also a swing dance. Its Reverse Turn can be, and frequently is, overturned. An \"Overturned Reverse Turn\" is a common entry into other figures. As with Waltz and Foxtrot, the possibility of overturning is built into the potential variations of the dance.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the other four dances. It is a \"staccato\" or \"marching\" dance, not a \"swing\" dance. It has no body sway, no rise and fall, and very limited continuous motion. The technique relies on sharp, precise placement of the feet and distinct weight changes. The structure of the Tango Reverse Turn is very specific in its foot placements and the amount of turn achieved at each step. There is no swing or momentum to carry the couple into extra rotation. Attempting to turn more than the prescribed amount would require twisting the upper body against the feet or changing the foot positions so drastically that it would no longer be a Reverse Turn. It would fundamentally violate the \"no swing,\" staccato, and compact-hold principles of Tango technique. The figure is mechanically constructed in a way that resists overturning.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** In the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), overturning is a common variation that utilizes the dance's inherent momentum and flow. In Viennese Waltz, the continuous rotation doesn't present a hard mechanical barrier to slight over-rotation. In European Tango, however, the lack of swing and the staccato, placed nature of the technique create a mechanical structure for the Reverse Turn that cannot be overturned without fundamentally breaking the rules and character of the dance. Therefore, it is the only dance on the list where it is effectively impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
