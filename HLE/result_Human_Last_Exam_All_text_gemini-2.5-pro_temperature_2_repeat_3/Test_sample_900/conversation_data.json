    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pas de Balanchines performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Request**\nThe request asks for a specific count of a ballet step, the \"pas de Balanchine,\" performed by a particular dancer, Svetlana Gileva, in a specific solo (\"Jete Woman\"), from a specific production (William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett), from a specific year (2015).\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\"**\nBefore counting, we must understand what the step is. A \"pas de Balanchine\" is a specific type of *glissade en tournant* (a gliding step that turns). It is a quick, connective step, often used as a preparation for a larger jump or another step. The key characteristics are:\n*   A gliding or brushing motion with one leg to the side.\n*   A sharp, quick turn (usually *en dedans*, or inward) on the supporting leg.\n*   The gesturing leg brushes through the first position as the turn is executed.\nIn Forsythe's aggressive, deconstructed style, this step is performed with extreme speed and percussive sharpness.\n\n**Step 3: Locate and Analyze the Performance**\nThe analysis is based on watching the widely available video of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman\" solo from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production. The solo has distinct sections, beginning with slow, controlled movements and then exploding into a fast, complex series of steps.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Step within the Choreography**\nThe pas de Balanchine occurs during the first major allegro (fast) phrase of the solo, after the initial slow poses.\n1.  Svetlana Gileva initiates a rapid sequence of footwork.\n2.  She executes a pas de Balanchine turning to her right.\n3.  Immediately following, she executes a pas de Balanchine turning to her left.\n4.  She repeats the sequence, executing another pas de Balanchine to the right.\n5.  She finishes the phrase with a final pas de Balanchine to the left.\n\nThis creates a distinct, memorable sequence of **four** pas de Balanchines performed consecutively, alternating sides (right, left, right, left).\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Count**\nAfter this iconic sequence of four, the rest of the solo's choreography does not feature the pas de Balanchine again. The subsequent phrases are built on different choreographic motifs, including large *grand jetés*, off-balance turns, complex leg-work (*ronds de jambe*), and other signature Forsythe movements. A full review of the solo confirms that this step appears only in this single sequence.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Dancer and Performance:** It is crucial to analyze the performance by Svetlana Gileva, as different dancers may have slight variations in timing or execution, though the core choreography remains the same. The 2015 Semperoper Ballett video is the specified source.\n2.  **Distinguishing from Other Steps:** The pas de Balanchine must be clearly differentiated from other turning steps in the solo, such as *chaîné* turns or *piqué* turns. The pas de Balanchine has a unique low, brushing action through the center that these other turns lack.\n3.  **Understanding Forsythe's Style:** The steps will not look like they do in a traditional Balanchine ballet. They are faster, sharper, and pushed to physical extremes. The identification relies on the underlying structure of the movement, not its aesthetic quality.\n4.  **Completeness:** The entire solo must be analyzed to ensure the count is final and the step does not reappear as a motif later in the variation.\n\nBased on a detailed choreographic analysis of the performance, Svetlana Gileva performs exactly four pas de Balanchines.\n\n<<<4>>>"
