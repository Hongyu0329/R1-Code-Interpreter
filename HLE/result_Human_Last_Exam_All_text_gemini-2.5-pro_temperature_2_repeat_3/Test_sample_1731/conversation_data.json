    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a gas of light quanta (photons), derived using the principles of large deviation theory. The mentioned theorems, Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff, provide a rigorous information-theoretic foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics, particularly the principle of maximum entropy. This principle states that the equilibrium state of an isolated system corresponds to the macroscopic configuration that has the largest number of associated microscopic configurations. The probability of observing a significant deviation from this state is exponentially small in the size of the system, a key idea in large deviation theory. The entropy is directly related to the logarithm of this number of microstates and thus acts as the rate function governing these probabilities.\n\nTherefore, we can find the equilibrium values by maximizing the entropy of the photon gas subject to the physical constraints.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. System and Constraints**\n*   **System:** A gas of photons inside a cavity of volume `V` in thermal equilibrium at temperature `T`.\n*   **Particles:** Photons are bosons.\n*   **Key Property:** The number of photons is not conserved. This is a critical distinction from a typical gas of massive particles. In the language of the grand canonical ensemble, this corresponds to setting the chemical potential `μ` to zero.\n*   **Constraint:** The system is at a fixed temperature `T`, which means it can exchange energy with a heat bath. The equilibrium state will be characterized by a specific average total energy, `U`. Our goal is to find this `U` and the corresponding entropy `S`.\n\n**2. Finding the Equilibrium Distribution (Planck's Law)**\nThe macroscopic state is defined by the set of average occupation numbers `{<n_ε>}` for each energy level `ε`. To find the equilibrium distribution, we maximize the entropy `S`.\nThe number of ways `W_ε` to distribute `n_ε` indistinguishable photons into `g_ε` degenerate states of energy `ε` is given by the Bose-Einstein counting formula:\n`W_ε = (n_ε + g_ε - 1)! / (n_ε! * (g_ε - 1)!)`\nThe total entropy of the system is `S = k_B * ln(W) = k_B * ln(Π_ε W_ε)`.\nMaximizing this entropy subject to a fixed total average energy `U = Σ_ε <n_ε>ε` and with `μ=0` leads to the equilibrium distribution for the average number of photons per quantum state (`<n_ε>/g_ε`):\n`f(ε) = <n_ε>/g_ε = 1 / (exp(βε) - 1)`\nwhere `β = 1 / (k_B T)`. This is the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons, also known as the Planck distribution function.\n\n**3. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\nThe total mean energy `U` is the sum of energies of all photons. For a continuous spectrum of modes in a 3D cavity, we integrate the energy of a mode `ε` multiplied by the number of photons in that mode over the density of states `g(ε)`. The density of states for photons (including two polarization states) in a volume `V` is:\n`g(ε)dε = (8πV / (hc)^3) * ε^2 dε = (V / (π^2 (ħc)^3)) * ε^2 dε`\nThe mean energy `U` is then given by the integral:\n`U = ∫_0^∞ ε * f(ε) * g(ε) dε = ∫_0^∞ ε * [1 / (exp(βε) - 1)] * [(V ε^2) / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)] dε`\n`U = (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) * ∫_0^∞ (ε^3 / (exp(βε) - 1)) dε`\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `x = βε`, which gives `ε = x / β` and `dε = dx / β`:\n`U = (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) * (1/β^4) * ∫_0^∞ (x^3 / (exp(x) - 1)) dx`\nThe definite integral is a standard result related to the Riemann zeta function and equals `π^4/15`. Substituting this value and `β = 1/(k_B T)`:\n`U = (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) * (k_B T)^4 * (π^4 / 15)`\nSimplifying this expression gives the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation:\n`U = (π^2 k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) * V * T^4`\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\nWe can calculate the entropy using the fundamental thermodynamic relation for the Helmholtz free energy, `F = U - TS`. For a photon gas (a relativistic gas), the pressure `P` is related to the energy density `u = U/V` by `P = u/3`. The free energy is also given by `F = -PV`. Therefore:\n`F = - (u/3) * V = - (U/V)/3 * V = -U/3`\nSubstituting this into the definition of free energy:\n`-U/3 = U - TS`\n`TS = U + U/3 = 4U/3`\n`S = 4U / (3T)`\nNow we substitute the expression for `U` that we found in the previous step:\n`S = (4 / (3T)) * [(π^2 k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) * V * T^4]`\n`S = (4π^2 k_B^4 / (45 ħ^3 c^3)) * V * T^3`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (Bose case) in a volume `V` at temperature `T` are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n`U = (π^2 k_B^4 V T^4) / (15 ħ^3 c^3)`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n`S = (4π^2 k_B^4 V T^3) / (45 ħ^3 c^3)`\n\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nThe equilibrium values are:\nMean Energy:  `U = (π^2 * k_B^4 * V * T^4) / (15 * ħ^3 * c^3)`\nEntropy: `S = (4 * π^2 * k_B^4 * V * T^3) / (45 * ħ^3 * c^3)`\n>>>"
