The two problems are the **Regress Problem** and the **Circularity Problem**.
1.  **Regress Problem**: If justification is based on other beliefs, it creates an infinite regress where each belief needs to be justified by another belief, offering no ultimate foundation.
2.  **Circularity Problem**: If justification is based on other pieces of knowledge, the definition of knowledge becomes circular, as it uses the concept of "knowledge" to define itself.
