    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nThe game is defined by two players, each choosing to either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D). The payoff matrix is given as:\n```\n          Bob\n        C       D\n      +-------+-------+\n    C | (5,5) | (0,7) |\nAlice +-------+-------+\n    D | (7,0) | (1,1) |\n      +-------+-------+\n```\nIn the classical version of this game, the dominant strategy for each player is to Defect, regardless of the other player's action.\n*   If Bob Cooperates, Alice gets 7 by Defecting vs. 5 by Cooperating.\n*   If Bob Defects, Alice gets 1 by Defecting vs. 0 by Cooperating.\nThe same logic applies to Bob. Therefore, the unique Nash Equilibrium is (Defect, Defect), which results in a payoff of **(1, 1)**. This outcome is suboptimal, as both players would be better off with the (Cooperate, Cooperate) payoff of (5, 5). This is the \"dilemma\".\n\n### Step 2: Set up the Quantum Game\n\nWe use the widely adopted Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol for quantizing the game.\n\n1.  **State Space**: The classical moves C and D correspond to the basis vectors `|C⟩ = |0⟩` and `|D⟩ = |1⟩` of a qubit. The game space is the tensor product of the two players' Hilbert spaces.\n\n2.  **Initial State**: The problem states that we design the initial state for an optimal outcome. In quantum game theory, this implies introducing entanglement to allow for outcomes not possible in the classical game. The initial state `|Ψ_in⟩` is created by applying an entangling operator `Ĵ` to the basis state `|CC⟩`. For an optimal chance to resolve the dilemma, we use a maximally entangling operator, parameterized by `γ = π/2`:\n    `|Ψ_in⟩ = Ĵ(π/2)|CC⟩ = (1/√2) * (|CC⟩ + i|DD⟩)`\n\n3.  **Strategies**: Instead of classical moves, players choose a quantum strategy, which is a unitary operator from SU(2) applied to their qubit. Let Alice choose `Û_A` and Bob choose `Û_B`.\n\n4.  **Final State & Measurement**: After players apply their strategies, the state is `(Û_A ⊗ Û_B)|Ψ_in⟩`. Before measurement, a disentangling operator `Ĵ†` (the conjugate transpose of `Ĵ`) is applied. The final state measured is:\n    `|Ψ'⟩ = Ĵ†(Û_A ⊗ Û_B)Ĵ|CC⟩`\n    The expected payoff for each player is then calculated from the probabilities of measuring the four basis states `|CC⟩, |CD⟩, |DC⟩, |DD⟩`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Quantum Strategies and Payoffs\n\nIn the quantum version, players have a continuous space of strategies. We analyze the key strategies that emerge:\n*   The quantum equivalent of Cooperate (C) is the identity operator: `Ĉ = Î = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n*   The quantum equivalent of Defect (D) is the Pauli-X operator (a bit-flip): `D̂ = iσ_x = [[0, i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   A special \"miracle\" quantum strategy also becomes available: `Q̂ = iσ_z = [[i, 0], [0, -i]]`.\n\nLet's calculate the payoffs when players choose from the set `{Q̂, D̂}`.\n\n1.  **(Q̂, Q̂)**: Both players choose `Q̂ = iσ_z`.\n    *   The final state `|Ψ'⟩` is calculated to be `-|CC⟩`.\n    *   Probability `p_CC = |⟨CC|-|CC⟩|² = 1`. All other probabilities are 0.\n    *   Payoff = (5, 5). This is the Pareto optimal outcome.\n\n2.  **(D̂, Q̂)**: Alice chooses `D̂ = iσ_x`, Bob chooses `Q̂ = iσ_z`.\n    *   The final state `|Ψ'⟩` is calculated to be `-|DC⟩`.\n    *   Probability `p_DC = 1`. All other probabilities are 0.\n    *   Payoff for Alice: `7`. Payoff for Bob: `0`. The outcome is (7, 0).\n\n3.  **(Q̂, D̂)**: Alice chooses `Q̂ = iσ_z`, Bob chooses `D̂ = iσ_x`.\n    *   By symmetry, the final state `|Ψ'⟩` is `-|CD⟩`.\n    *   Probability `p_CD = 1`. All other probabilities are 0.\n    *   Payoff for Alice: `0`. Payoff for Bob: `7`. The outcome is (0, 7).\n\n4.  **(D̂, D̂)**: Both players choose `D̂ = iσ_x`.\n    *   The final state `|Ψ'⟩` is calculated to be `-|DD⟩`.\n    *   Probability `p_DD = 1`. All other probabilities are 0.\n    *   Payoff = (1, 1).\n\n### Step 4: Find the Nash Equilibrium\n\nWe can now construct the strategic form of the quantum game, where the players choose between strategy `Q̂` and `D̂`:\n```\n          Bob\n        Q̂       D̂\n      +-------+-------+\n    Q̂ | (5,5) | (0,7) |\nAlice +-------+-------+\n    D̂ | (7,0) | (1,1) |\n      +-------+-------+\n```\nThis payoff matrix is identical in structure to the original classical Prisoner's Dilemma. We can analyze it for the Nash Equilibrium:\n*   From Alice's perspective:\n    *   If Bob plays `Q̂`, Alice is better off playing `D̂` (payoff 7 > 5).\n    *   If Bob plays `D̂`, Alice is better off playing `D̂` (payoff 1 > 0).\n*   Thus, `D̂` is a strictly dominant strategy for Alice. The same logic applies to Bob.\n\nThe unique Nash Equilibrium is for both players to choose the strategy `D̂`. This is true even if we allow players to choose from a wider set of SU(2) strategies; the `D̂` strategy remains the best response.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Equilibrium Point\n\nThe equilibrium point is the set of payoffs corresponding to the Nash Equilibrium. Since the equilibrium strategy profile is `(D̂, D̂)`, the corresponding payoff is **(1, 1)**.\n\nDespite the introduction of quantum mechanics and maximal entanglement, the dilemma is not resolved in this standard formulation. The game is transformed, but the new strategic form remains a Prisoner's Dilemma, leading to the same suboptimal outcome as the classical equilibrium point.\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(1,1)}}$."
