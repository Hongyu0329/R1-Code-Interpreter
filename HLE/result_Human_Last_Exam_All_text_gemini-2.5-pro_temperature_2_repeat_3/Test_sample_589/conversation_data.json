    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Query**\nThe request asks for a specific Hollywood feature film with several distinct elements:\n*   **Platform:** A Hollywood feature film.\n*   **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n*   **Character:** A teenager.\n*   **Object:** A pink bike.\n*   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination**\nLet's consider films that involve teenagers and bikes, and see if they fit the other criteria.\n\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** Features kids on bikes, but the protagonist Elliott is a young boy, not a teenager. His older brother Michael is a teenager, but the iconic bike is not pink, and the famous scene involves flying *over* government vehicles, not pedaling *toward* them.\n*   ***The Goonies* (1985):** The teenager \"Brand\" rides a bike at the beginning of the film, but it's a red BMX, not pink. He isn't shown pedaling toward a car in the manner described.\n*   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure* (1985):** The main character is a man-child, not a teenager. His iconic, beloved bike is famously red and white, not pink.\n*   ***Pretty in Pink* (1986):** The protagonist, Andie, is a teenager and is heavily associated with the color pink. However, her signature vehicle is a pink Volkswagen Karmann Ghia, not a bike.\n*   ***It* (2017):** The \"Losers' Club\" are teenagers who ride bikes, but none of the key bike scenes involve a pink bike being ridden directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Specific Combination of Clues**\nThe combination of \"teenager,\" \"pink bike,\" and \"oncoming car\" points to a very specific scene, likely played for comedy or drama. This unique combination strongly suggests the scene is a memorable plot point or a comedic gag.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Correct Film**\nLet's analyze the film **'She's the Man' (2006)** against the criteria:\n\n*   **Hollywood feature film by a major studio?** Yes, it was produced by DreamWorks Pictures and distributed by Paramount Pictures, both major studios.\n*   **Teenager?** Yes, the protagonist Viola Hastings, played by Amanda Bynes, is a high school teenager.\n*   **Pink bike?** Yes. In a memorable montage, Viola's friend Paul tries to teach her how to act more \"feminine\" to attract her crush, Duke. One of the lessons involves her awkwardly riding a small, pink girl's bicycle, complete with handlebar streamers.\n*   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. During this montage, Viola is unsteady on the pink bike and loses control. She swerves directly into the path of an oncoming car, which screeches to a halt just inches from her. The scene is used for comedic effect to highlight her \"unladylike\" nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe 2006 film *She's the Man* perfectly matches every specific detail laid out in the question.\n\n<<<She's the Man>>>"
