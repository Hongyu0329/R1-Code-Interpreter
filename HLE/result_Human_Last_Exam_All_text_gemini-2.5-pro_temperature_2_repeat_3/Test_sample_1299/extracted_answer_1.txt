A) Let \(\ell = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_s^{e_s}\) be the prime factorization of \(\ell\). \( |U_\ell| = \prod_{i=1}^s (2e_i+1) \). An alternative form "in terms of \(\ell\)" not relying on its explicit factorization is \( \sum_{k|\ell} 2^{\omega(k)} \).
B) In terms of the exponents, \( |T_\ell| = \left(\prod_{i=1}^s (2e_i+1)\right) - 1 + \delta_{\ell,1} \). Assuming the formula should cover all positive integers \(\ell\), including \(\ell=1\).
