    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct character from William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Source Text:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Character Trait 1:** The character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Character Trait 2:** The character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Specific Detail:** The description must contain an allusion that readers would recognize as the myth of Romulus and Remus. The key elements of this myth are twin brothers being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:** We must consider which characters in the novel would have had direct experience with the Roman world. The Wolfings live on the frontier of the Roman Empire and are preparing for war against them. This suggests that contact would likely be through captivity, trade, or as a spy. The most prominent character with a past involving the Romans is Otter.\n    *   **Otter** is the foster-son of the war-leader Thiodolf. He is also a skald (a poet and storyteller). In the narrative, he recounts his past, which includes being captured and living as a thrall (slave) among the Romans. This makes him the most likely candidate.\n    *   **Thiodolf** is the leader of the Wolfings, and his focus is on defending his people. There is no indication he spent time in a Roman city.\n    *   **The Hall-Sun** is a supernatural being, a valkyrie. Her knowledge is mystical, not based on mundane travel to Roman cities.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Passage:** The scene where a character discusses Roman customs in detail occurs in **Chapter XII: Otter Addresses the Folk**. The Wolfings are gathered at their Thing (assembly) to discuss the impending Roman threat. Otter rises to speak and shares what he learned during his captivity.\n\n4.  **Analyze Otter's Speech:** In his speech, Otter directly contrasts the Wolfings' deep, ancestral reverence for the wolf with what he observed among the Romans.\n    *   He explains that he was taken to a Roman town and saw their forum.\n    *   He describes seeing a specific image or statue: \"...there saw I the image of a she-wolf, with two man-children sucking her paps...\"\n    *   He explicitly states he asked about its meaning and was told it was \"the token of their own begetting; that they were the sons of the Wolf...\"\n    *   This is an unmistakable and direct description of the Lupa Capitolina (Capitoline Wolf) statue, the most famous artistic representation of the Romulus and Remus myth.\n\n5.  **Confirm All Conditions are Met:**\n    *   **Character:** Otter.\n    *   **Visited a Roman City?** Yes, he recounts his time as a captive there.\n    *   **Describes Religious Practices?** Yes, he describes the Roman founding myth and contrasts its role in their society with the Wolfings' own faith.\n    *   **Refers to Romulus and Remus?** Yes, the description of a she-wolf suckling \"two man-children\" is a clear and direct reference to the myth.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe character who visited a Roman city and described their founding myth in a way that alludes to Romulus and Remus is Otter, the skald and foster-son of Thiodolf. He does so during his speech to the Wolfing assembly in Chapter XII of the book.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
