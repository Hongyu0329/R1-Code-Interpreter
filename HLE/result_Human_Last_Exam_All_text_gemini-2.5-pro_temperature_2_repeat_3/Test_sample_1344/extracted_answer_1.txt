**Metal:** Zirconium (Zr)

**Ligands and Support:** The optimal system is a single-site Zirconium Hydride catalyst chemically grafted onto a high-surface-area silica (SiO₂) support. In this heterogeneous system, the surface siloxy groups (`≡SiO-`) of the silica act as robust, immobilizing ligands that provide exceptional thermal stability. The hydride (`-H`) ligand on the zirconium center is the active site for the catalytic transformations.

**Rationale for Optimality:**
1.  **Dual-Functionality:** At lower temperatures (~50-100 °C) and in the presence of olefin monomer, the Zr-H site initiates efficient polymerization via migratory insertion.
2.  **Robust Hydrogenolysis:** At higher temperatures (>150 °C) and under hydrogen pressure, the same site catalyzes hydrogenolysis. The catalyst activates the polymer's C-H bonds, cleaves C-C bonds via β-alkyl elimination, and hydrogenates the resulting fragments into short, saturated alkanes.
3.  **Stability and Practicality:** The covalent grafting onto the silica support prevents the catalyst from aggregating or decomposing at high temperatures, preserving its single-site nature. As a solid, it is easily separated from the liquid alkane products, making it highly practical for industrial applications.
