    "This question requires a two-part answer: the current common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year that name was effectively coined or first appeared in a major publication.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Genus and its Native Range:**\n    *   The genus in question is *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*.\n    *   Bees of this genus are native to North and Central America, with the highest diversity found in the deserts of the southwestern United States and Mexico. They are known for their incredibly small size.\n\n2.  **Determine the Current Common Name:**\n    *   A search of reliable entomological sources, including university extension websites (e.g., UC Riverside's Center for Insect Systematics), insect identification guides (like BugGuide.net), and conservation organizations (The Xerces Society), shows a consistent common name.\n    *   Due to their minute size (many are only 2-3 mm long) and delicate appearance, bees of the genus *Perdita* are most commonly and currently referred to as **\"fairy bees\"**. While other descriptive names like \"dwarf bees\" are sometimes used, \"fairy bees\" is the most widely accepted and evocative common name.\n\n3.  **Determine When the Name Was Coined:**\n    *   This is the more challenging part, as common names, unlike scientific names, are not always formally proposed with a specific date. They often emerge from community usage and are solidified when they appear in influential publications.\n    *   The task is to find the earliest significant publication that uses this name, effectively \"coining\" it for popular use.\n    *   Scientific papers, including the original descriptions by Frederick Smith (1853) or the extensive taxonomic work by P. H. Timberlake, do not typically use common names.\n    *   Checking major, influential books on bee biology and natural history is the most effective method.\n    *   The name \"fairy bees\" appears in modern guides like \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" (2016) and \"The Bees of the World\" (2007).\n    *   To find an earlier origin, we can look at seminal works that popularized native bee awareness. The landmark book **\"The Forgotten Pollinators\"** by Stephen L. Buchmann and Gary Paul Nabhan, published in **1996**, uses the term. On page 42, the authors write: \"Extremely tiny 'fairy bees' (the size of a typed hyphen) in the genus *Perdita* fly out to these floral targets...\"\n    *   This 1996 publication is widely considered a key text that brought the importance of native pollinators to a broader audience. Its use of \"fairy bees\" represents one of the earliest prominent appearances in a widely-read, authoritative book, and it is the best-documented point for the name entering common parlance. While it may have been used informally by entomologists before this date, this publication serves as the most reliable record for its \"coining\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Common Name vs. Scientific Name:** It's crucial not to confuse the formal scientific name (*Perdita*) with its common name (\"fairy bees\").\n*   **\"Coining\" of Common Names:** The \"coining\" of a common name is often a process of popularization rather than a single, dated event. The date provided corresponds to the first major, influential publication that cemented the name's usage.\n*   **Prevalence:** While other names may exist, the question asks for the \"currently used common name,\" and \"fairy bees\" is the most prevalent and widely recognized.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Common Name:** fairy bees\n*   **Year Coined/Popularized:** 1996\n\nThe final answer is constructed by combining these two elements as requested.\n\n<<<fairy bees, 1996>>>"
