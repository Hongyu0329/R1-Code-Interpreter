    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the topological group $G$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Group**\n\n    Let $G$ be a topological group. It is not necessarily Hausdorff. The standard way to handle non-Hausdorff topological groups is to consider the quotient group with respect to the closure of the identity element. Let $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.\n    *   $N$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n    *   The condition that $G$ might fail to be Hausdorff means that $N$ is not necessarily the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n    *   Consider the quotient group $H = G/N$. With the quotient topology, $H$ is a T0 topological group.\n    *   A key theorem states that a T0 topological group is automatically Hausdorff (and even Tychonoff). Thus, $H$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\n2.  **Properties of the Quotient Group H**\n\n    The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous, open, surjective homomorphism. We can deduce the properties of $H$ from the properties of $G$.\n    *   **Compactness:** Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is a continuous surjection, $H$ is compact.\n    *   **First-Countability:** Since $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is an open surjection, $H$ is first-countable. The character of $H$ is $\\chi(H) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Since infinite Hausdorff groups cannot have character less than $\\aleph_0$, we have $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   **Metrizability:** A theorem by Birkhoff and Kakutani states that a Hausdorff, first-countable topological group is metrizable. Since $H$ has these properties, it is metrizable.\n    *   **Weight:** A compact metrizable space is second-countable, meaning it has a countable base. Therefore, the weight of $H$ is $w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n3.  **Cardinality Relations**\n\n    We can now relate the cardinalities of $G$, $H$, and $N$.\n    *   The group $G$ is partitioned by the cosets of $N$, which are the elements of $H$. Therefore, $|G| = |H| \\cdot |N|$.\n    *   For a Hausdorff space $X$, we have the inequality $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$. Applying this to $H$, we get $|H| \\le 2^{w(H)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak{c}$.\n    *   We are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Substituting this into the cardinality relation:\n        $2^{2^\\frak c} = |H| \\cdot |N|$.\n    *   Since $|H| \\le \\frak c$, it must be that $|N| \\ge \\frac{2^{2^\\frak c}}{\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This implies that $|N| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n4.  **Upper Bound for the Weight of G**\n\n    The weight of a topological space $w(X)$ is related to its density $d(X)$ (the minimum cardinality of a dense subset). For any space, $d(X) \\le w(X)$. For a first-countable topological group $G$, it is a known result that $w(G) = d(G)\\chi(G)$. Since $\\chi(G)=\\aleph_0$ and $w(G)$ must be infinite (as $|G|$ is), this simplifies to $w(G)=d(G)$.\n    *   Since $H$ is second-countable ($w(H)=\\aleph_0$), it is separable, meaning it has a countable dense subset, so $d(H)=\\aleph_0$. Let $D_H$ be a countable dense subset of $H$.\n    *   Let's consider the preimage $K = \\pi^{-1}(D_H) \\subseteq G$. We can show that $K$ is dense in $G$. Let $U$ be any non-empty open set in $G$. Since $\\pi$ is an open map, $\\pi(U)$ is a non-empty open set in $H$. Because $D_H$ is dense in $H$, $\\pi(U) \\cap D_H \\neq \\emptyset$. This implies that $U \\cap K \\neq \\emptyset$. Thus, $K$ is dense in $G$.\n    *   The density of $G$ is therefore at most the cardinality of $K$: $d(G) \\le |K|$.\n    *   The cardinality of $K$ is $|\\pi^{-1}(D_H)| = |D_H| \\cdot |N| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot |N| = |N| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   So, we have $d(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Since $w(G) = d(G)$, we get an upper bound for the weight: $w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n5.  **Lower Bound for the Weight of G**\n\n    To find a lower bound, we use a cardinal function inequality that holds for all topological spaces. A theorem by Hajnal and Juhász states that for any topological space $X$, $|X| \\le (w(X))^{L(X)}$, where $L(X)$ is the Lindelöf number of $X$ (the smallest infinite cardinal $\\lambda$ such that every open cover has a subcover of cardinality at most $\\lambda$).\n    *   The group $G$ is given to be compact. A compact space is necessarily Lindelöf, which means its Lindelöf number is $L(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   Applying the inequality to $G$: $|G| \\le (w(G))^{L(G)}$.\n    *   Substituting the known values: $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le (w(G))^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   Let $\\kappa = w(G)$. Since $G$ is first-countable and infinite, its weight $\\kappa$ must be an infinite cardinal. For any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, the expression $\\kappa^{\\aleph_0}$ is equal to $\\max(\\kappa, 2^{\\aleph_0}) = \\max(\\kappa, \\frak c)$.\n    *   The inequality becomes $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le \\max(\\kappa, \\frak c)$.\n    *   Since the cardinal $2^{2^\\frak c}$ is strictly greater than $\\frak c$, we must have $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le \\kappa$.\n    *   This provides the lower bound for the weight: $w(G) \\ge 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n\n    Combining the upper and lower bounds:\n    *   From Step 4: $w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$\n    *   From Step 5: $w(G) \\ge 2^{2^\\frak c}$\n\n    Therefore, the weight of the group $G$ must be exactly $2^{2^\\frak c}$. The existence of such a group is asserted by the fact that these deductions from the given properties lead to a unique possible value for the weight without contradiction.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The non-Hausdorff property is crucial. It leads to the decomposition $G \\to G/N$ where $N$ is a non-trivial subgroup.\n*   Properties of the quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$ (continuous, open, surjective) are essential to relate the properties of $G$ and $H$.\n*   The fact that a T0 group is Hausdorff is a specific property of topological groups.\n*   The relation $w(G)=d(G)$ for first-countable groups simplifies the problem to finding the density.\n*   The general cardinal inequality $|X| \\le (w(X))^{L(X)}$ is a powerful tool from set-theoretic topology that provides the necessary lower bound. It's important that this inequality does not require separation axioms.\n*   The compactness of G is used twice: to ensure the quotient $H$ is compact, and to establish that $L(G)=\\aleph_0$.\n\nThe largest possible weight of the group is determined by these constraints.\n\n<<<2^{2^\\frak c}>>>"
