    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons ($N_{elec}$).**\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. The formula indicates:\n*   1 Carbon (C) atom\n*   3 Hydrogen (H) atoms (two from $\\mathrm{CH}_2$, one from $\\mathrm{SiH}$)\n*   1 Silicon (Si) atom\n*   1 Fluorine (F) atom\n\nNext, we sum the electrons for each atom to find the total number of electrons in the neutral molecule:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 3 atoms × 1 electron/atom = 3 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n*   **Total electrons ($N_{elec}$)** = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = **32 electrons**.\n\nA full CI calculation is typically performed for a specific spin state. For a stable, closed-shell molecule, we assume a singlet ground state (S=0). For a singlet state, the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_\\alpha$) equals the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_\\beta$).\n*   $n = N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N_{elec} / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions / spatial orbitals ($N_{orb}$).**\nThe number of molecular orbitals in a calculation is equal to the total number of basis functions. We need to determine the number of basis functions for each atom using the 6-31G** basis set. The `**` notation indicates that polarization functions are added to both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and hydrogen atoms. We assume the standard use of 6 Cartesian d-functions for polarization on heavy atoms and 3 p-functions on hydrogen.\n\n*   **Carbon (C, a 2nd-row atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G basis provides 9 functions (1 for the 1s core, and a split valence of 2x(1s+3p)=8 for the 2s and 2p orbitals).\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of d-polarization functions (6 functions).\n    *   Total for C = 9 + 6 = **15 basis functions**.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G basis provides 2 functions (a split valence for the 1s orbital).\n    *   The second `*` adds one set of p-polarization functions (3 functions).\n    *   Total for H = 2 + 3 = **5 basis functions**.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si, a 3rd-row atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G basis provides 13 functions (5 for the 1s, 2s, 2p core, and a split valence of 8 for the 3s and 3p orbitals).\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of d-polarization functions (6 functions).\n    *   Total for Si = 13 + 6 = **19 basis functions**.\n\n*   **Fluorine (F, a 2nd-row atom):**\n    *   Same count as Carbon. Total for F = 9 + 6 = **15 basis functions**.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in the molecule:\n*   $N_{orb}$ = (1 × N(C)) + (3 × N(H)) + (1 × N(Si)) + (1 × N(F))\n*   $N_{orb}$ = (1 × 15) + (3 × 5) + (1 × 19) + (1 × 15)\n*   $N_{orb}$ = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = **64 orbitals**.\n*   Let $K = N_{orb} = 64$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the formula for the number of singlet CSFs.**\nThe number of CSFs for a full CI calculation with $N_{elec}$ electrons in $K$ spatial orbitals for a state of total spin S is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula. For a singlet state (S=0), the formula is:\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\frac{1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{n} \\binom{K+1}{n+1}$\nwhere $K$ is the number of orbitals and $n$ is the number of alpha (or beta) electrons.\n\nSubstitute the values we found: $K = 64$ and $n = 16$.\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{64+1} \\binom{64+1}{16} \\binom{64+1}{16+1}$\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final number.**\nThis calculation requires the use of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic due to the large numbers involved.\n\n1.  Calculate the binomial coefficients:\n    *   $\\binom{65}{16} = 5,792,454,652,431,625$\n    *   $\\binom{65}{17} = 16,823,908,272,979,216$\n\n2.  Multiply the binomial coefficients:\n    *   $\\binom{65}{16} \\times \\binom{65}{17} = 97,451,248,422,216,721,300,447,543,040,000$\n\n3.  Divide by 65. The result must be an integer, as it represents a number of states.\n    *   $N_{CSF} = \\frac{97,451,248,422,216,721,300,447,543,040,000}{65}$\n    *   $N_{CSF} = 1,499,249,975,726,411,096,929,962,200,608$\n\nThis number is the total count of Configuration State Functions for a singlet state in the specified calculation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<1499249975726411096929962200608>>>"
