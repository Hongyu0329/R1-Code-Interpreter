    "This problem asks for the number of distinct power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group of size 128, which is denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$, denoted $Q_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, x^{2^{n-2}} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nFor a size of 128, we have $2^n = 128$, which implies $n=7$. So, we are dealing with the group $Q_{128}$. Its presentation is:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ are of two forms:\n1.  Powers of $x$: $x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n2.  Elements of the form $x^i y$: $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nFor a group $G$ and an integer $m$, the power subgroup $G^m$ is the subgroup generated by the set of all $m$-th powers of elements in $G$.\n$G^m = \\langle g^m \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set $\\{ (Q_{128})^m \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the m-th powers of elements in Q_128**\n\nWe need to compute $g^m$ for every $g \\in Q_{128}$. There are two types of elements to consider.\n\n*   **Type 1: $g = x^i$**\n    $g^m = (x^i)^m = x^{im}$.\n*   **Type 2: $g = x^i y$**\n    To compute $(x^i y)^m$, we first find the square of this element:\n    $(x^i y)^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i (y x^i) y = x^i (x^{-i} y) y = (x^i x^{-i}) y^2 = y^2$.\n    Using the group relation, $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$ for any $i$.\n    This implies that the square of any element not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $x^{32}$. It also implies that all elements of the form $x^i y$ have order 4, since $(x^i y)^4 = ((x^i y)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n\nNow, let's analyze $g^m$ for the two types of elements based on whether $m$ is even or odd.\n\n**Step 4: Case 1: m is an odd integer**\n\nLet $m = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$.\n*   For elements $g = x^i$, their $m$-th powers are $x^{im}$. The subgroup generated by all these powers is $\\langle x^m \\rangle$. Since $m$ is odd, $\\gcd(m, 64) = 1$. Thus, $\\langle x^m \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   For elements $g = x^i y$, their $m$-th power is:\n    $(x^i y)^m = (x^i y)^{2k+1} = ((x^i y)^2)^k (x^i y) = (x^{32})^k (x^i y) = x^{32k} x^i y$.\n*   The power subgroup $(Q_{128})^m$ is generated by all these powers. So it is generated by $\\langle x^m \\rangle$ and all elements of the form $x^{32k} x^i y$.\n    $(Q_{128})^m = \\langle \\langle x^m \\rangle, \\{ x^{32k} x^i y \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\} \\rangle$.\n*   Since $\\langle x^m \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$, the generator $x$ is in $(Q_{128})^m$.\n*   Also, by taking $i=0$ in the second set of generators, we see that $x^{32k}y$ is in $(Q_{128})^m$.\n*   Since $x$ is in the subgroup, $x^{32k}$ is also in the subgroup, and so is its inverse $x^{-32k}$.\n*   Then, the product $(x^{-32k})(x^{32k}y) = y$ must also be in the subgroup.\n*   Since both generators $x$ and $y$ are in $(Q_{128})^m$, the subgroup is the entire group $Q_{128}$.\n*   **Conclusion for odd m:** For any odd integer $m$, $(Q_{128})^m = Q_{128}$. This gives us **one** distinct power subgroup.\n\n**Step 5: Case 2: m is an even integer**\n\nLet $m=2k$ for some integer $k$.\n*   For elements $g=x^i$, their $m$-th powers generate the subgroup $\\langle x^m \\rangle$.\n*   For elements $g = x^i y$, their $m$-th power is:\n    $(x^i y)^m = (x^i y)^{2k} = ((x^i y)^2)^k = (x^{32})^k = x^{32k}$.\n*   The power subgroup $(Q_{128})^m$ is generated by the elements from both types of powers:\n    $(Q_{128})^m = \\langle \\langle x^m \\rangle, \\{ x^{32k} \\} \\rangle$.\n*   Note that since $m=2k$, we can write $x^{32k}$ as $x^{16(2k)} = x^{16m}$.\n    $(Q_{128})^m = \\langle x^m, x^{16m} \\rangle$.\n*   Since $x^{16m} = (x^m)^{16}$, it is already an element of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^m \\rangle$. Therefore, the generating set is redundant.\n    $(Q_{128})^m = \\langle x^m \\rangle$.\n*   Now we need to determine how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way. A subgroup of the form $\\langle x^m \\rangle$ in a cyclic group of order 64 is determined by $\\gcd(m, 64)$.\n    $\\langle x^m \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(m, 64)} \\rangle$.\n*   We are looking for the set of subgroups $\\{\\langle x^d \\rangle \\mid d = \\gcd(m, 64) \\text{ for some even } m\\}$.\n*   Since $m$ is even ($m=2k$), $d = \\gcd(2k, 64)$ must be an even divisor of 64 (or 64 itself if $m$ is a multiple of 64). The divisors of 64 are {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}.\n*   The even divisors are {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}.\n*   For each of these even divisors $d$, we can find an even number $m$ (e.g., $m=d$) such that $\\gcd(m, 64) = d$.\n    *   $d=2$: gives $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (subgroup of order 32)\n    *   $d=4$: gives $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (subgroup of order 16)\n    *   $d=8$: gives $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (subgroup of order 8)\n    *   $d=16$: gives $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (subgroup of order 4)\n    *   $d=32$: gives $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (subgroup of order 2)\n    *   $d=64$: gives $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n*   **Conclusion for even m:** For even integers $m$, we obtain **six** distinct power subgroups.\n\n**Step 6: Final Count**\n\nWe combine the results from the two cases:\n1.  When $m$ is odd, we get exactly one power subgroup: $Q_{128}$ itself.\n2.  When $m$ is even, we get six distinct power subgroups: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint, as the first set contains the whole group $Q_{128}$, while the second set only contains proper cyclic subgroups.\nTotal number of distinct power subgroups = 1 (from odd m) + 6 (from even m) = 7."
