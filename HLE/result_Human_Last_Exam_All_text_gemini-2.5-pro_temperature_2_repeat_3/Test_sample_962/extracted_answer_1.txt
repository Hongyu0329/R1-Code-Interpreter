A threshold signature scheme is a system where a single public key is associated with a secret key that is shared among n parties. Any subgroup of t or more parties can collaborate to produce a signature, while any group with t-1 or fewer parties cannot. A tightly secure, two-round protocol for this is highly efficient and desirable for practical applications like cryptocurrency wallets and secure infrastructure management.

To design such a scheme, we follow these principles:

**1. Foundational Choices:**
*   **Underlying Cryptography:** Use a signature scheme with algebraic properties suitable for secret sharing, such as Schnorr signatures.
*   **Secret Sharing:** Employ Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) for the one-time Distributed Key Generation (DKG) phase. This allows `n` parties to create a single public key `Y = g^x` while each party `P_i` receives a private share `s_i` of the secret `x`, without any single party ever knowing `x`.

**2. The Two-Round Signing Protocol Design:**
The protocol design centers around preventing malicious participants (up to `t-1`) from influencing the final signature based on honest parties' inputs. This is achieved with a commit-and-reveal structure. Let a group `S` of `t` parties want to sign a message `m`.

**Round 1: Commitment**
Each participant `P_i` in the signing g
