The edges of the objects in the image will be rounded and smoothed. Sharp corners will be eliminated as convex corners are eroded and concave corners are filled in with each iteration. Small or thin features will be removed, causing small objects to disappear and holes to be filled. The overall effect is that the shapes of the objects bounded by the edges become simpler and more compact, tending towards circular shapes for closed objects, while straight edges remain stable.
