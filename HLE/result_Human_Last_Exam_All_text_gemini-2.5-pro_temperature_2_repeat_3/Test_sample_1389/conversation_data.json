    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine confers perfect immunity to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while providing no protection at all to the remaining percentage. Let's say the vaccine has an efficacy for susceptibility, `VE_s`. This means a proportion `VE_s` of vaccinated individuals are fully immune, and the remaining proportion, `1 - VE_s`, are as susceptible to infection as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (`VE_p`):** This is the proportional reduction in the risk of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen for a vaccinated individual compared to an unvaccinated one.\n*   **Incidence Rate (`I`):** The rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population during a specified period (e.g., cases per person-year).\n    *   `I_u`: Incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n    *   `I_v`: Incidence rate in the vaccinated group.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR`):** The ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. `IRR = I_v / I_u`.\n*   **Vaccine Efficacy Estimated from Incidence Rates (`VE_IRR`):** This is the standard formula for calculating vaccine efficacy from a cohort study or clinical trial. It is calculated as `VE_IRR = 1 - IRR`.\n\n**2. Relate \"All-or-Nothing\" Efficacy to \"Per-Exposure\" Efficacy (`VE_p`)**\n\nFor an all-or-nothing vaccine, we need to determine its effect on a per-exposure basis for an *average* vaccinated individual.\n*   A fraction `VE_s` of vaccinated people are perfectly immune (0% chance of infection per exposure).\n*   A fraction `1 - VE_s` are not immune at all (same chance of infection per exposure as an unvaccinated person).\n*   Let `P` be the probability of infection for an unvaccinated person after one exposure.\n*   The average probability of infection for a vaccinated person after one exposure is:\n    `(VE_s * 0) + ((1 - VE_s) * P) = (1 - VE_s) * P`\n*   The per-exposure efficacy, `VE_p`, is the proportional reduction in this risk compared to an unvaccinated person:\n    `VE_p = (Risk_unvac - Risk_vac) / Risk_unvac = (P - (1 - VE_s) * P) / P = 1 - (1 - VE_s) = VE_s`\n*   **Crucial Point:** For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) is mathematically identical to the proportion of the population that is fully protected (`VE_s`).\n\n**3. Model the Incidence Rates**\n\nLet's model the incidence rates based on the force of infection, `λ`. The force of infection is the instantaneous rate at which a susceptible individual acquires the infection. For this analysis, we assume `λ` is the same for both groups (i.e., they have similar exposure patterns).\n\n*   **Incidence in Unvaccinated Group (`I_u`):** The entire unvaccinated group is susceptible. Therefore, the rate of new infections is simply the force of infection.\n    `I_u = λ`\n*   **Incidence in Vaccinated Group (`I_v`):** Only the non-protected fraction `(1 - VE_s)` of the vaccinated group is at risk of infection. The protected fraction `VE_s` will never get infected. So, the force of infection only applies to the susceptible portion of the vaccinated group. The overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group is:\n    `I_v = λ * (1 - VE_s)`\n\n**4. Calculate `1 - IRR` and Compare**\n\nNow we can calculate the `1 - IRR` measure and see how it relates to the true per-exposure efficacy (`VE_p`, which we know equals `VE_s`).\n\n*   First, find the Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR`):\n    `IRR = I_v / I_u = (λ * (1 - VE_s)) / λ = 1 - VE_s`\n*   Next, calculate the vaccine efficacy from this ratio:\n    `VE_IRR = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - VE_s) = VE_s`\n*   We already established that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, `VE_p = VE_s`.\n*   Therefore, `VE_IRR = VE_p`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Model Assumption:** This result depends on the simple epidemiological model where the force of infection `λ` is constant over time and equal for both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. In reality, factors like behavioral changes or waning immunity could complicate this.\n2.  **Definition of Efficacy:** The conclusion is specific to the relationship between the incidence of infection and *per-exposure* efficacy against infection.\n3.  **Universality of Result:** Interestingly, the same conclusion holds for a \"leaky\" vaccine (one that provides partial protection to everyone). For a leaky vaccine with per-exposure efficacy `VE_p`, `I_v = λ * (1 - VE_p)`. The calculation `1 - IRR` still results in `VE_p`. Thus, `1 - IRR` is a robust estimator of per-exposure efficacy under these model assumptions, regardless of the biological mechanism (all-or-nothing vs. leaky).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe measure `1 - IRR` is calculated to be `VE_s`. For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) is also equal to `VE_s`. Since the estimated value equals the true value, the `1 - incidence rate ratio` **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
