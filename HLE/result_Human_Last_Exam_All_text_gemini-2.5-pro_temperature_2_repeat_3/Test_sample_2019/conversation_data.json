    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and Attacks\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around from top to bottom and from left to right. We can label the rows and columns from 0 to 4. A move off one edge reappears on the opposite edge.\n*   **Queen Attacks:** A queen at position `(r, c)` attacks any square `(r', c')` if:\n    1.  `r = r'` (same row)\n    2.  `c = c'` (same column)\n    3.  `r - c ≡ r' - c' (mod 5)` (same main diagonal)\n    4.  `r + c ≡ r' + c' (mod 5)` (same anti-diagonal)\n\nThe \"non-attacking\" condition for 4 queens `(r1,c1), (r2,c2), (r3,c3), (r4,c4)` means that for any pair of queens `i` and `j`:\n*   `ri ≠ rj`\n*   `ci ≠ cj`\n*   `ri - ci ≢ rj - cj (mod 5)`\n*   `ri + ci ≢ rj + cj (mod 5)`\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Counting Strategy\n\nA valid placement of 4 queens requires them to be in different rows and different columns. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, any valid placement must leave exactly one row and one column empty.\n\nThis insight allows us to break the problem down:\n1.  Choose the 4 rows that will contain the queens.\n2.  Choose the 4 columns that will contain the queens.\n3.  For the chosen 4x4 subgrid, count the number of ways to place the queens so they don't attack each other according to the toroidal rules.\n\nLet's calculate the number of ways for each part.\n*   **Ways to choose 4 rows:** There are 5 rows, so the number of ways to choose 4 is `C(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * 1!) = 5`.\n*   **Ways to choose 4 columns:** Similarly, there are 5 columns, so the number of ways to choose 4 is `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n\nThis gives a total of `5 * 5 = 25` possible 4x4 subgrids for the queens.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Placements on a Subgrid\n\nLet's determine `k`, the number of valid ways to place the 4 queens on a single chosen subgrid.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must verify that `k` is the same for every choice of a 4x4 subgrid. A symmetry argument confirms this. A valid solution on one subgrid (e.g., rows/cols {0,1,2,3}) can be translated by `(a,b)` modulo 5 to create a valid solution on another subgrid (rows/cols `{a, 1+a, 2+a, 3+a}` and `{b, 1+b, 2+b, 3+b}`). This means the number of solutions `k` is constant for all 25 subgrids.\n\nLet's calculate `k` for the simplest subgrid: rows `R = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and columns `C = {0, 1, 2, 3}`. A placement can be represented by a permutation `p` of `(0, 1, 2, 3)`, where the queens are at `(0, p0), (1, p1), (2, p2), (3, p3)`.\n\nWe must check the two toroidal diagonal conditions for each of the `4! = 24` permutations of `(0, 1, 2, 3)`.\n\nLet's test the two solutions from the standard 4-queens problem:\n1.  **Placement `p = (1, 3, 0, 2)`:**\n    *   Queens are at `(0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2)`.\n    *   Main diagonal indices `(r - c) mod 5`:\n        *   `0 - 1 = -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n        *   `1 - 3 = -2 ≡ 3 (mod 5)`\n        *   `2 - 0 = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n        *   `3 - 2 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n        *   The values `{4, 3, 2, 1}` are all distinct. This condition is met.\n    *   Anti-diagonal indices `(r + c) mod 5`:\n        *   `0 + 1 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n        *   `1 + 3 = 4 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n        *   `2 + 0 = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n        *   `3 + 2 = 5 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`\n        *   The values `{1, 4, 2, 0}` are all distinct. This condition is also met.\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n\n2.  **Placement `p = (2, 0, 3, 1)`:**\n    *   Queens are at `(0,2), (1,0), (2,3), (3,1)`.\n    *   Main diagonal indices `(r - c) mod 5`:\n        *   `0 - 2 = -2 ≡ 3 (mod 5)`\n        *   `1 - 0 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n        *   `2 - 3 = -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n        *   `3 - 1 = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n        *   The values `{3, 1, 4, 2}` are all distinct. This condition is met.\n    *   Anti-diagonal indices `(r + c) mod 5`:\n        *   `0 + 2 = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n        *   `1 + 0 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n        *   `2 + 3 = 5 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`\n        *   `3 + 1 = 4 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n        *   The values `{2, 1, 0, 4}` are all distinct. This condition is also met.\n    *   This is another valid solution.\n\nA thorough check of all 24 permutations confirms that these are the only two valid solutions for this specific subgrid. Therefore, `k = 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nNow we combine the results from the previous steps.\n*   Number of ways to choose the subgrid = 25.\n*   Number of valid placements on any given subgrid (`k`) = 2.\n\nTotal number of ways = (Number of subgrids) × (Number of placements per subgrid)\nTotal number of ways = 25 × 2 = 50.\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
