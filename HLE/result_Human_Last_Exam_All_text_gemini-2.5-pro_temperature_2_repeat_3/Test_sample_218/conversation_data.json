    "To find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Irreducible Representations of $S_n$\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ..., \\lambda_k)$ such that their sum is $n$.\n\nFor $n=25$, we need to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 such that the dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $f^\\lambda$, satisfies $f^\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\n### Step 2: The Hook-Length Formula\nThe dimension $f^\\lambda$ is calculated using the hook-length formula:\n$$ f^\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h(i,j)} $$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h(i,j)$ is the hook length of the box at row $i$ and column $j$. The hook length is the number of boxes to its right in the same row, plus the number of boxes below it in the same column, plus the box itself.\n\n### Step 3: Strategy for Finding Low-Dimension Irreps\nCalculating $f^\\lambda$ for all partitions of 25 (there are 1958 of them) is impractical. We know that irreps with small dimensions correspond to partitions that are \"long\" or \"thin\" (i.e., far from the \"center\"). These are partitions where the first part $\\lambda_1$ is large, or partitions with many parts (which are the conjugate partitions of those with large $\\lambda_1$).\n\nWe will systematically search for these partitions by letting $k = n - \\lambda_1$, which is the number of boxes not in the first row. We expect $f^\\lambda$ to be small for small values of $k$. For each $k$, we consider all partitions of $k$ to form the rest of $\\lambda$.\n\nAlso, for any partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by reflecting the Young diagram along the main diagonal) has the same dimension, $f^\\lambda = f^{\\lambda'}$. If $\\lambda$ is not self-conjugate, this gives us a pair of irreps with the same dimension. For $n=25$, we expect the low-dimension irreps to come in such pairs.\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nWe check partitions $\\lambda = (25-k, p)$ where $p$ is a partition of $k$.\n\n*   **k = 0:** The only partition of 0 is the empty set. $\\lambda = (25)$.\n    *   $f^{(25)} = 1$.\n    *   Conjugate: $(1^{25})$, $f^{(1^{25})} = 1$.\n    *   Count: 2.\n\n*   **k = 1:** The only partition of 1 is (1). $\\lambda = (24,1)$.\n    *   $f^{(24,1)} = 25 - 1 = 24$.\n    *   Conjugate: $(2, 1^{23})$, dimension also 24.\n    *   Count: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n*   **k = 2:** Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,2)$: $f^{(23,2)} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 24}{2} - 25 = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,1,1)$: $f^{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    *   Both and their conjugates are below the limit.\n    *   Count: 4 + 2*2 = 8.\n\n*   **k = 3:** Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,3)$: $f^{(22,3)} = 2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,2,1)$: $f^{(22,2,1)} = 4025$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,1,1,1)$: $f^{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n    *   All three and their conjugates are below the limit.\n    *   Count: 8 + 3*2 = 14.\n\n*   **k = 4:** Partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,4)$: $f^{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,3,1)$: $f^{(21,3,1)} = 564,300$ (which is > 500,000).\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,2,2)$: $f^{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,2,1,1)$: $f^{(21,2,1^2)} = 31,625$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,1,1,1,1)$: $f^{(21,1^4)} = 10,626$.\n    *   4 partitions (and their conjugates) satisfy the condition.\n    *   Count: 14 + 4*2 = 22.\n\n*   **k = 5:** Partitions of 5 are 7 in number: (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), (1^5).\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,5)$: $f^{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,4,1)$: $f^{(20,4,1)}$ is > 500,000.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,3,2)$: $f^{(20,3,2)} = 207,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,3,1,1)$: $f^{(20,3,1^2)} = 164,525$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,2,2,1)$: $f^{(20,2,2,1)} = 209,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,2,1,1,1)$: $f^{(20,2,1^3)} = 83,125$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,1^5)$: $f^{(20,1^5)} = 42,504$.\n    *   6 partitions (and their conjugates) satisfy the condition.\n    *   Count: 22 + 6*2 = 34.\n\n*   **k = 6:** Partitions of 6 are 11 in number.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19,6)$: $f^{(19,6)} = 123,970$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19,1^6)$: $f^{(19,1^6)} = 134,596$.\n    *   For other partitions $p$ of 6, $f^{(19, p)}$ is greater than 500,000. For instance, $f^{(19,5,1)} \\approx 9 \\times 10^5$.\n    *   2 partitions (and their conjugates) satisfy the condition.\n    *   Count: 34 + 2*2 = 38.\n\n*   **k = 7:** Partitions of 7 are 15 in number.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18,7)$: $f^{(18,7)} = 303,600$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18,1^7)$: $f^{(18,1^7)} = 346,104$.\n    *   Other partitions $p$ of 7 result in dimensions > 500,000. For example, $f^{(18,6,1)} \\approx 2.3 \\times 10^6$.\n    *   2 partitions (and their conjugates) satisfy the condition.\n    *   Count: 38 + 2*2 = 42.\n\n*   **k = 8:** Partitions of 8 are 22 in number.\n    *   $\\lambda = (17,8)$: $f^{(17,8)} = 600,875$ (> 500,000).\n    *   All other partitions with $k \\ge 8$ will have even larger dimensions.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\nWe sum the number of irreps found for each value of k:\n*   k=0: 1 partition + its conjugate = 2 irreps.\n*   k=1: 1 partition + its conjugate = 2 irreps.\n*   k=2: 2 partitions + their conjugates = 4 irreps.\n*   k=3: 3 partitions + their conjugates = 6 irreps.\n*   k=4: 4 partitions + their conjugates = 8 irreps.\n*   k=5: 6 partitions + their conjugates = 12 irreps.\n*   k=6: 2 partitions + their conjugates = 4 irreps.\n*   k=7: 2 partitions + their conjugates = 4 irreps.\n\nThe total number of irreps is $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 4 + 4 = 42$.\nNone of these partitions are self-conjugate, so we are correct to count each partition and its conjugate as distinct."
