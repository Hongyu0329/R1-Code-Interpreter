    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Key Elements\nThe query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film identified by a single scene. Let's break down the required elements:\n1.  **Film Status:** It must be an Oscar-nominated film. This doesn't mean it had to win, just that it received at least one Academy Award nomination in any category.\n2.  **Character Action:** A character says the specific words \"Thank you.\"\n3.  **Context:** This line is spoken while the character is on or boarding a bus.\n4.  **Consequence:** This act of saying \"Thank you\" directly leads to the character's doom, effectively \"sealing his fate.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Clues to Identify the Film\n*   The combination of a seemingly innocent phrase like \"Thank you\" with a fatal consequence suggests a thriller or mystery plot where identity or a voice is a key piece of evidence.\n*   The scene described is highly specific and memorable for those who have seen the film. It's a major turning point in the plot.\n*   The film that perfectly matches all these criteria is **The Fugitive (1993)**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Scene Details in *The Fugitive*\n1.  **Oscar-nominated?** Yes. *The Fugitive* was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Tommy Lee Jones won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film.\n2.  **The Character:** The character is the \"one-armed man,\" Fredrick Sykes, the actual murderer of Dr. Richard Kimble's wife.\n3.  **The Scene:** Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) has tracked Sykes down. He sees Sykes getting on a city bus. To confirm it's him, Kimble has an associate on the phone who is playing a recording of the 911 call from the night of the murder. On that tape, the killer says \"Thank you\" to the 911 operator. A friendly transit cop, at Kimble's request, gets on the bus and speaks to Sykes. When the interaction is over, Sykes politely says **\"Thank you\"** to the cop.\n4.  **Seals his fate?** Absolutely. Kimble and his associate hear the voice over the phone, and it's a perfect match to the voice on the 911 tape. This is the moment Kimble gets 100% confirmation of the killer's identity. This knowledge empowers Kimble to pursue Sykes relentlessly, leading directly to their final confrontation on the L-train, where Sykes is killed. By saying those two simple words, Sykes unknowingly confirmed he was the murderer to the very man he framed, sealing his fate.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   The question is not about the main protagonist, but another character in the film.\n*   The phrase \"seals his fate\" implies a definitive, negative outcome that is set in motion by the action. The voice confirmation on the bus is the critical turning point that guarantees Sykes will be brought to justice (or killed) by Kimble.\n*   The detail of the Oscar nomination is important to filter out other potential movies. *The Fugitive*'s nomination for Best Picture solidifies its status as a qualifying film.\n\nBy following these steps and verifying the details, the film in question can be identified with high confidence.\n\n<<<The Fugitive>>>"
