    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Composition:**\n    *   The molecule is toluene.\n    *   Its chemical formula is C7H8.\n    *   This means the molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation:**\n    The notation `k-lmnG` describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions. A contracted Gaussian function is a fixed linear combination of primitive Gaussian functions and acts as a single basis function.\n    *   The calculation requires us to find the total number of these basis functions for the entire molecule.\n    *   We need to determine the number of basis functions for each type of atom (Carbon and Hydrogen) and then sum them up.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Contracted Functions per Carbon (C) Atom:**\n    Carbon is a \"heavy atom\" (non-hydrogen). Its electron configuration is 1s², 2s², 2p².\n    *   **Core Orbital (1s):** The `6-` in 6-31G specifies that the core 1s orbital is represented by **1 contracted function**, which is built from 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The `-31G` part describes the valence shell. It's a \"split-valence\" basis set, meaning the valence orbitals are represented by two basis functions each.\n        *   **Inner Valence:** The `3` means the \"inner\" part of the valence shell is described by one set of functions, where each function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians. This includes one s-type function (for the 2s orbital) and a set of three p-type functions (for the 2px, 2py, 2pz orbitals).\n            *   Number of inner valence functions = 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 contracted functions**.\n        *   **Outer Valence:** The `1` means the \"outer\" part of the valence shell is described by another set of functions, where each function is a single primitive Gaussian. This also includes one s-type function and a set of three p-type functions.\n            *   Number of outer valence functions = 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 contracted functions**.\n    *   **Total per Carbon:** Adding the functions for the core and the two parts of the valence shell:\n        *   Total C functions = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Contracted Functions per Hydrogen (H) Atom:**\n    Hydrogen only has a 1s valence orbital and no core electrons.\n    *   The `6-` part of the notation does not apply to Hydrogen.\n    *   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The `-31G` describes its valence 1s orbital, which is split into two functions:\n        *   **Inner Function:** The `3` corresponds to **1 contracted function** (built from 3 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   **Outer Function:** The `1` corresponds to **1 contracted function** (which is a single primitive Gaussian).\n    *   **Total per Hydrogen:**\n        *   Total H functions = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Functions for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    Now we multiply the number of functions per atom by the count of each atom in the molecule and sum the results.\n    *   **Total from Carbon atoms:** 7 C atoms × 9 functions/C atom = 63 functions.\n    *   **Total from Hydrogen atoms:** 8 H atoms × 2 functions/H atom = 16 functions.\n    *   **Grand Total:** 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79 functions.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for *contracted* functions (the basis functions used in the calculation), not the total number of *primitive* Gaussians.\n*   **Split-Valence:** The `-` in `6-31G` separates the description of the core orbitals from the valence orbitals. The splitting `31` applies only to the valence shell.\n*   **p-Orbitals:** A set of p-type basis functions always includes three individual functions (px, py, pz). This is why the count for p-functions is always multiplied by 3.\n*   **Hydrogen vs. Heavy Atoms:** The interpretation of the basis set notation is different for Hydrogen compared to atoms with core electrons (like Carbon).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nTotal functions = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\nTotal functions = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\nTotal functions = 63 + 16\nTotal functions = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
