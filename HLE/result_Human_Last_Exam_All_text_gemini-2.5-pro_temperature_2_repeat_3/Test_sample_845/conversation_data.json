    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value used to compute HRV.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Track HR (Heart Rate) and HRV (Heart Rate Variability).\n    *   **Methodology:** Use PPG (Photoplethysmography) to capture \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Central Question:** What is the name of the value computed *between* heartbeats?\n\n2.  **Understanding the Measurement:**\n    *   A heartbeat is a single cardiac cycle. When we measure the time from the peak of one heartbeat to the peak of the next consecutive heartbeat, we get a time duration, usually measured in milliseconds (ms).\n    *   For example, the time between two beats might be 800 ms, the next might be 850 ms, and the one after that might be 790 ms.\n    *   HRV is not one of these single values; rather, it's a statistical calculation (like the standard deviation) performed on a series of these time intervals to quantify their variation.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Terminology:**\n    *   The \"value between heartbeats\" refers to the time duration of that interval.\n    *   The most general and widely used term for this measurement is the **Inter-Beat Interval**, often abbreviated as **IBI**.\n    *   This term is technology-agnostic and applies whether the data comes from PPG (as mentioned in the question) or an ECG.\n\n4.  **Considering Alternative and Related Terms (Careful Points):**\n    *   **R-R Interval:** This is another extremely common term. Specifically, it refers to the interval between the R-peaks of two consecutive QRS complexes on an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Since the R-peak is the most prominent feature of an ECG heartbeat, it's the standard landmark for measuring the interval in clinical settings.\n    *   **IBI vs. R-R Interval:** While R-R interval is specific to ECG, and the question mentions PPG, the two terms are often used interchangeably in the broader HRV literature. PPG measures the pulse wave that results from the heartbeat, so the interval between pulse peaks (sometimes called a Peak-to-Peak or P-P interval) is a direct proxy for the R-R interval. However, **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** is the more accurate and general term that encompasses measurements from any source, including PPG.\n    *   **HR vs. IBI:** It's important not to confuse the IBI with Heart Rate (HR). HR is typically an average expressed in beats per minute (BPM), while IBI is the precise time of a single interval in milliseconds. You can calculate the instantaneous HR from a single IBI (e.g., HR = 60,000 ms / IBI in ms), but the IBI itself is the foundational measurement for HRV.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the specific value captured between heartbeats to compute HRV is the time duration of that interval. The most appropriate and common name for this value is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. The term **R-R interval** is also correct and very common, though it originates from ECG terminology.\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)"
