    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Question:**\n*   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay. This implies the pun or clue exists within the Russian language.\n*   **Setting:** The wide boulevards of Vienna. This provides the context for the description. Vienna's famous boulevard is the Ringstrasse, which is wide and lined with trees.\n*   **Clue:** The surname of an English poet *appears* in the description. This suggests it's not explicitly named but is hidden as a pun within a Russian word or phrase.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the surname in English.\n\n**2. Identifying Potential Puns in Russian:**\nWe need to think of Russian words that would be used to describe a wide, tree-lined boulevard and sound like a famous English poet's name.\n\n*   The boulevards are **wide**. The Russian word for \"wide\" (plural, short form) is \"широки\" (shiroki). This does not immediately bring a poet's name to mind.\n*   The Vienna boulevards form a **ring** (Ringstrasse). The Russian word for \"ring\" is \"кольцо\" (kol'tso). This sounds somewhat like the name **Coleridge** (in Russian, Кольридж - Kol'ridzh). This is a possibility, but a better one exists.\n*   The boulevards have **trees**. Trees have leaves that **rustle**. The Russian word for \"to rustle\" is \"шелестеть\" (shelestet'). In a sentence, one might say the leaves \"are rustling\" - \"шелестят\" (shelestyat), or hear the \"rustle\" - \"шелест\" (shelest).\n\n**3. Connecting the Pun to a Poet:**\n*   Let's analyze the most promising pun: \"шелест\" (shelest) or \"шелестят\" (shelestyat).\n*   Phonetically, the root \"шелест\" [she-lest] sounds very similar to the surname of the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe **Shelley**.\n*   In Russian, Shelley is written as \"Шелли\". The phonetic resemblance to \"шелест\" is clear and is a classic example used in Russian literary puzzles.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\nA Russian text describing the wide, tree-lined boulevards of Vienna would very likely mention the sound of the leaves. A phrase like \"листья шелестят\" (the leaves are rustling) would contain the phonetic clue. Thus, the poet's surname hidden in the description is Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
