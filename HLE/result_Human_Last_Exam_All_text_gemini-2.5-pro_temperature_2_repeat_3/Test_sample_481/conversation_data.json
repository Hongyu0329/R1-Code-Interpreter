    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Identify the numerical imprints on two specific medications.\n    *   **Medication 1:** Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\n    *   **Medication 2:** Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n    *   **Key Constraint 1:** Focus *only* on the imprinted numbers.\n    *   **Key Constraint 2:** Explicitly do *not* mention color differences.\n    *   **Key Constraint 3:** Explicitly do *not* mention the word \"PLIVA\".\n    *   **Key Constraint 4:** Explicitly do *not* mention size differences.\n\n2.  **Careful Points to Consider:**\n    *   Drug imprints are unique identifiers. Different manufacturers and different strengths of the same drug have different imprints.\n    *   It is critical to specify the manufacturer (\"Teva\") as requested, as other generic versions of fluoxetine will have completely different markings.\n    *   Drug imprints can sometimes be updated. The analysis should be based on current, reliable data from pharmaceutical databases.\n    *   The prompt asks for \"the different numbers\" (plural), indicating that the answer should include the number from each capsule.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Information (Step-by-Step):**\n    *   **Step A: Identify the imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 10mg.**\n        *   A search in reliable drug databases for \"Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule\" (specifically associated with Teva's NDC, or National Drug Code, 0093-3104) reveals the capsule is marked on two sides.\n        *   One side is imprinted with the company name, \"TEVA\".\n        *   The other side is imprinted with the number **3104**.\n    *   **Step B: Identify the imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 20mg.**\n        *   A similar search for \"Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule\" (associated with NDC 0093-3105) shows it is also marked on two sides.\n        *   One side is imprinted with the company name, \"TEVA\".\n        *   The other side is imprinted with the number **3105**.\n    *   **Step C: Synthesize the Final Answer.**\n        *   Following all constraints, the analysis shows the number on the 10mg capsule is \"3104\" and the number on the 20mg capsule is \"3105\". These are the different numbers requested.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3104, and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3105.>>>"
