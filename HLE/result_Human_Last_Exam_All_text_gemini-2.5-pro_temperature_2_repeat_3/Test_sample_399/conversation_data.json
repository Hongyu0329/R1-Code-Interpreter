    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis equation is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We can see that it is possible to separate the variables, putting all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other side. Thus, it is a separable differential equation.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\nTo separate the variables, we can move the $x^2$ term to the left side with $dx$ and the $dt$ term to the right side.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt $$\nThis is valid as long as $x(t) \\neq 0$. The initial condition is $x(0) = -8$, which is not zero. The constant function $x(t)=0$ is a solution to the ODE, but it does not satisfy the initial condition. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the zero solution, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   The left-hand side integral is $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   The right-hand side integral is $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nCombining these results, we get the general solution in implicit form, where $C$ is the constant of integration:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our equation to solve for $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**5. Write the particular solution**\nNow that we have the value of $C$, we can write the particular solution for the given initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1)**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution equation:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow, we simplify the right-hand side. To do this, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, to solve for $x(1)$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   **Separation of Variables:** Ensure you can legally divide by terms involving the dependent variable (in this case, $x^2$). This is justified because the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ means the solution is not the trivial $x(t)=0$ solution.\n*   **Integration:** Remember the constant of integration, $C$. A common mistake is to forget it. Also, be careful with the integration formulas, particularly for powers like $x^{-2}$.\n*   **Applying Initial Condition:** Substitute the values of $t$ and $x$ from the initial condition correctly to find $C$.\n*   **Solving for the Final Value:** Perform the arithmetic carefully, especially when dealing with fractions. There is no need to find the explicit form $x(t) = f(t)$, as you can directly substitute $t=1$ into the implicit solution.\n\nThe final answer is obtained by following these steps carefully.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
