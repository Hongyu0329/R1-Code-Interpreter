    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher who belongs to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\" and is known for a particular conceptual analysis: decomposing the \"notion of hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n**2. Identify the Key Terms:**\n*   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This is a renowned school of philosophy and logic in Poland, founded by Kazimierz Twardowski. Its prominent members include Stanisław Leśniewski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The answer must be one of these figures or a closely associated one.\n*   **Hallmark:** This term is a bit general in English. In this philosophical context, it's a translation for a concept like a 'sign', 'mark', or 'indicator' (in Polish, likely *znak* or *oznaka*). The core idea is something that stands for or indicates something else.\n*   **Decomposition into \"Symptoms\" and \"Signals\":** This is the most crucial and specific part. We are looking for a philosopher who made a clear distinction between these two types of signs.\n    *   **Symptom (Natural Sign):** This kind of sign has a natural, causal, or inherent link to what it signifies. The classic example is smoke being a symptom of fire. Its existence is a natural consequence of the fire.\n    *   **Signal (Conventional Sign):** This kind of sign has an artificial or conventional link to what it signifies, established by agreement, rule, or intention. Examples include words in a language, traffic lights, or gestures. The meaning is assigned, not inherent.\n\n**3. Connecting the Concepts to the School:**\nThe distinction between natural and conventional signs is a fundamental topic in semiotics (the theory of signs) and the philosophy of language. Several members of the Lviv-Warsaw School worked on these areas, but one is particularly famous for this specific analysis.\n\n**4. The Philosopher in Question:**\nBy examining the works of the major figures in the Lviv-Warsaw School, we can pinpoint the correct philosopher.\n*   **Kazimierz Twardowski** laid the groundwork with his analysis of representations.\n*   **Tadeusz Kotarbiński** was known for reism.\n*   **Jan Łukasiewicz and Alfred Tarski** were primarily focused on formal logic.\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**, however, made significant contributions to epistemology and the philosophy of language. He developed a sophisticated theory of signs and meaning.\n\n**5. Ajdukiewicz's Contribution:**\nIn his work, particularly in his seminal book \"Pragmatic Logic,\" Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz introduces a clear and influential classification of signs (*znaki*). He distinguishes between:\n*   **Oznaki (Symptoms/Indications):** These are natural signs. His analysis is that `A` is a symptom of `B` if the occurrence of `A` increases the probability of the occurrence of `B` based on a known natural correlation.\n*   **Znaki właściwe (Proper Signs/Signals):** These are signs based on convention or communication rules. He identifies them as tools used within a specific language or system to convey thoughts from a user to a recipient. This category includes words and other conventional symbols.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposes the notion of a sign (referred to as a \"hallmark\" in the question) into natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This distinction is a cornerstone of his philosophy of language.\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
