The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the groups `G` that can be expressed as a semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ C₂`, where `Q` is any abelian group of order `q^m` and the non-identity element of `C₂` acts on `Q` via the inversion automorphism (`g ↦ g⁻¹` for all `g ∈ Q`).
