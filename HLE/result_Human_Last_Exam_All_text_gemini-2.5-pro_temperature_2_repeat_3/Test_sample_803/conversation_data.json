    "An analysis of the problem to find all nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n*   **Group `G` of order `2q^m`**: A finite group with `2q^m` elements, where `q` is an odd prime (`q ≥ 3`) and `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\n*   **Nonabelian Group**: A group where the commutative property `ab=ba` does not hold for all elements `a, b`.\n*   **Product-Free Set**: A subset `S` of `G` such that for any `x, y ∈ S` (including `x=y`), the product `xy` is not in `S`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set**: A product-free set `S` that is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n*   **Filled Group**: A group `G` where every maximal product-free set `S` is a generating set for `G` (i.e., `<S> = G`).\n\n**2. Finding a Usable Criterion for a \"Filled Group\"**\nWorking directly with the definition of maximal product-free sets is complex. We rely on established theorems that provide equivalent, more algebraic conditions.\n*   **Theorem (Tomkinson)**: A finite group `G` is a filled group if and only if it has a unique maximal normal subgroup.\n*   **Theorem (Konev, Maslova)**: A finite non-abelian group `G` of order `2n`, where `n` is odd, is a filled group if and only if `|C_G(t)| = 2` for any involution `t` (element of order 2) in `G`.\n\nThe second theorem is particularly well-suited for this problem. Our group `G` has order `2q^m`, where `n=q^m` is odd. We will use this criterion.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of Groups of Order `2q^m`**\nLet `G` be a group of order `2q^m`.\n*   **Sylow's Theorems**:\n    *   The number of Sylow `q`-subgroups, `n_q`, must divide 2 and satisfy `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`. Since `q` is an odd prime, `n_q` cannot be 2. Thus, `n_q = 1`. This means there is a unique Sylow `q`-subgroup, `Q`, which is therefore a normal subgroup of `G`. We have `|Q| = q^m`.\n    *   There exist Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 2. Let `P = <x>` be one such subgroup, where `x` is an involution (`x^2 = e`).\n*   **Semidirect Product Structure**: Since `Q` is a normal subgroup and `Q ∩ P = {e}`, `G` can be expressed as a semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ P`.\n*   **Homomorphism**: The semidirect product is defined by a homomorphism `φ: P → Aut(Q)`. This homomorphism is determined by the image of the generator `x`, `φ(x) = α ∈ Aut(Q)`. The condition `x^2 = e` implies that `α^2` must be the identity automorphism on `Q`.\n*   **Nonabelian Condition**: Since `G` is nonabelian, the semidirect product is not a direct product. This means `φ` is a non-trivial homomorphism, so `α` is not the identity automorphism. `α` is an automorphism of `Q` of order 2.\n\n**4. Applying the \"Filled Group\" Criterion to G = Q ⋊ P**\nWe use the criterion: `G` is filled if and only if `|C_G(t)| = 2` for any involution `t ∈ G`.\n*   **Involutions in G**: The complements of the normal subgroup `Q` are the Sylow 2-subgroups, and they are all conjugate to each other by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem. All involutions in `G` lie in these subgroups. We can therefore test the condition for the single involution `x` from our chosen Sylow 2-subgroup `P`.\n*   **Calculating the Centralizer C_G(x)**: The centralizer `C_G(x)` is the set of all elements `g ∈ G` that commute with `x`. Let `g ∈ C_G(x)`. We can write `g = q'p'` where `q' ∈ Q` and `p' ∈ P`.\n    The condition `gx = xg` becomes `(q'p')x = x(q'p')`.\n    Since `p'` is in `P = <x>`, it commutes with `x`. So we can simplify to `q'xp' = xq'p' ⇒ q'x = xq'`.\n    This means an element `g=q'p'` is in `C_G(x)` if and only if its `Q`-part `q'` commutes with `x`.\n*   The condition `q'x = xq'` is equivalent to `xq'x⁻¹ = q'`. In terms of the automorphism `α`, this is `α(q') = q'`. The set of such elements `q'` forms a subgroup of `Q` called the fixed-point subgroup of `α`, denoted `C_Q(α)`.\n*   Therefore, `C_G(x) = {qp | q ∈ C_Q(α), p ∈ P}`. This is the subgroup `C_Q(α) ⋊ P`.\n*   The order of the centralizer is `|C_G(x)| = |C_Q(α)| ⋅ |P| = |C_Q(α)| ⋅ 2`.\n\n**5. Deducing the Properties of Q and the Action α**\n*   For `G` to be a filled group, we must have `|C_G(x)| = 2`.\n*   From our calculation, this means `|C_Q(α)| ⋅ 2 = 2`, which implies `|C_Q(α)| = 1`.\n*   The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup `{e}`. Thus, `C_Q(α) = {e}`.\n*   This means that the automorphism `α` must be **fixed-point-free**: the only element of `Q` fixed by `α` is the identity element `e`.\n*   There is a classical theorem in group theory stating that a finite `p`-group (`p` is prime) which admits a fixed-point-free automorphism of order 2 must be abelian. Here, `Q` is a `q`-group with `q` odd, and `α` has order 2, so this theorem applies. **Therefore, Q must be an abelian group.**\n*   Furthermore, for an abelian group `Q`, a fixed-point-free automorphism `α` of order 2 must be the **inversion map**: `α(q) = q⁻¹` for all `q ∈ Q`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\nThe nonabelian filled groups `G` of order `2q^m` must have the following structure:\n*   `G` is a semidirect product `Q ⋊ C₂`, where `Q` is an abelian group of order `q^m` for an odd prime `q` and `m ≥ 1`.\n*   The action of the non-identity element of `C₂` on `Q` is the inversion map, `q ↦ q⁻¹`.\n\nSuch groups are guaranteed to be nonabelian (as `Q` is non-trivial and the inversion map is not the identity) and satisfy the criterion for being a filled group. Examples of such groups include the familiar dihedral groups `D_{2q^m}` (where `Q = C_{q^m}` is cyclic) and also generalizations where `Q` is any non-cyclic abelian group of order `q^m` (e.g., `Q = C_q × C_q × ... × C_q`).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Correct Criterion**: Choosing the right theorem simplifies the problem immensely. The criterion on the centralizer of involutions is the most direct.\n2.  **Group Structure**: The semidirect product structure `G = Q ⋊ P` is a critical starting point.\n3.  **Properties of Automorphisms**: Understanding that `α` must be of order 2 and that a fixed-point-free automorphism of order 2 on a `q`-group (odd `q`) forces the group to be abelian and the action to be inversion is key.\n4.  **Conjugacy of Involutions**: The fact that all involutions are conjugate in this class of groups allows us to test the centralizer condition for a single, conveniently chosen involution.\n5.  **Scope**: The answer covers all abelian `q`-groups for `Q`, not just cyclic ones.\n\nThe final answer is the family of groups constructed as the semidirect product of an abelian `q`-group `Q` with the cyclic group of order 2, where the action is inversion.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the groups `G` that can be expressed as a semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ C₂`, where `Q` is any abelian group of order `q^m` and the non-identity element of `C₂` acts on `Q` via the inversion automorphism (`g ↦ g⁻¹` for all `g ∈ Q`).>>>"
