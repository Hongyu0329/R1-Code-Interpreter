    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The central subject of the question is a specific painting: \"The Radionist\".\n2.  **Identify Key Details:** The question provides several key pieces of information to pinpoint the exact artwork and its history:\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year of Acquisition:** 1967\n3.  **Formulate a Research Strategy:** The goal is to find the museum that matches all these criteria. The most efficient approach is to first locate the painting and then verify its acquisition history.\n4.  **Locate the Painting:** A search for \"Kurt Günther, The Radionist, 1927\" reveals that the painting (in German, \"Der Radionist\") is a well-known work of the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement in Germany. Multiple reliable sources, including art history websites and museum collection databases, list its current location.\n5.  **Identify the Holding Institution:** The search results consistently point to the **Nationalgalerie** (National Gallery) in Berlin, which is part of the **Staatliche Museen zu Berlin** (Berlin State Museums).\n6.  **Verify the Acquisition Date:** The final step is to confirm the year of acquisition. Consulting the official online collection database of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin for the painting \"Der Radionist\" by Kurt Günther (Inventory No. F.V. 56) confirms the provenance details. The records explicitly state that the painting was acquired in **1967** from the artist's estate.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important to distinguish between the specific gallery (Nationalgalerie) and the larger museum organization (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin). While both are correct, \"Nationalgalerie\" is more specific.\n*   The original German title, \"Der Radionist,\" can be helpful in searches to yield more precise results from German sources.\n*   Verifying information with the museum's own collection database is the most reliable method to confirm details like acquisition dates.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the research, the Nationalgalerie, a part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (National Gallery, Berlin State Museums)>>>"
