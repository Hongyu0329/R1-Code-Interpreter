    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Question and Constraints**\n\nThe question has several key components that must be addressed carefully:\n1.  **First book of the Bible**: We must search for mentions of biblical books.\n2.  **In canonical order**: The search must proceed sequentially starting from Genesis, then Exodus, and so on. The Protestant canon is the most relevant for Shakespeare's context.\n3.  **Mentioned by name**: The play's text must explicitly contain the name of the book (e.g., \"Numbers\" or \"Book of Proverbs\"). A mere allusion to a story or character from a book (like referencing Cain and Abel from Genesis) is not sufficient.\n4.  **In a Shakespeare play**: The source material is the collected works of William Shakespeare.\n5.  **The final answer requires two pieces of information**: The name of the biblical book and the name of the play it is mentioned in.\n\n### **Step 2: List Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls**\n\n*   **Allusion vs. Direct Mention:** This is the most critical distinction. Shakespeare's plays are filled with allusions to biblical stories (Adam and Eve, the patience of Job, Daniel come to judgment), but very few direct mentions of the books by name. We must filter out the allusions.\n*   **Contextual Meaning:** Some book names are common words (e.g., \"Numbers,\" \"Kings,\" \"Judges\"). We must verify that the context of the quote points specifically to the biblical book and not the common meaning of the word.\n*   **Systematic Search:** We cannot simply search for any biblical book. The question demands we find the *first one* in the Bible's own sequence. Therefore, the search must be performed in canonical order, stopping at the first valid hit.\n\n### **Step 3: Sequential Search and Analysis**\n\nWe will now search for each book of the Bible by name in Shakespeare's plays, following the canonical order.\n\n1.  **Genesis**: There are many allusions to stories from Genesis (Cain and Abel in *Henry VI, Part 1* and *Hamlet*; Jacob's ladder in *The Merchant of Venice*), but the word \"Genesis\" itself does not appear in any play.\n    *   *Result: Not mentioned.*\n\n2.  **Exodus**: There are allusions to events from Exodus, such as Jaques' line in *As You Like It* about railing \"against all the first-born of Egypt.\" However, the book is not mentioned by its name, \"Exodus.\"\n    *   *Result: Not mentioned.*\n\n3.  **Leviticus**: The word \"Leviticus\" does not appear in Shakespeare's plays.\n    *   *Result: Not mentioned.*\n\n4.  **Numbers**: The word \"numbers\" appears frequently, usually meaning poetic meter or quantities. However, there is one instance where it clearly refers to the biblical book.\n    *   **Play:** *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act 3, Scene 1)\n    *   **Speaker:** Sir Hugh Evans, a Welsh parson.\n    *   **Quote:** \"Have I not my Book of Numbers about me?\"\n    *   **Analysis:** The speaker is a parson, a man of the cloth, who would be very likely to carry books of the Bible. He mentions this book alongside a \"Book of Songs and Sonnets\" and a \"Book of Riddles,\" confirming he is speaking of a specific, titled volume. This is a clear and direct mention.\n\nSince we have found a confirmed mention of the Book of Numbers, and the preceding books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) were not mentioned by name, this is our answer. We don't need to proceed further down the biblical canon (to books like Psalms or Proverbs, which are also mentioned elsewhere in Shakespeare) because Numbers is the first one in the sequence.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe systematic search reveals that the Book of Numbers is the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be explicitly named in a Shakespearean play. This mention occurs in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.>>>"
