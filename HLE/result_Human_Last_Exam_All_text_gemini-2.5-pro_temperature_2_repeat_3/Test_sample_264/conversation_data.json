    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry and Set Up a Coordinate System\nThe problem involves two identical cubes, each with a side length of 1. One cube is shifted relative to the other. To analyze this, we first need to place the cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nLet the first cube, C1, be represented by the region where its coordinates `x, y, z` fall within the interval `[0, 1]`.\nSo, `C1 = { (x, y, z) | 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1 }`.\nThe side length of this cube is 1, as required.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Shift\nThe crucial part of the problem is to understand the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n*   **The Main Diagonal:** A main diagonal of this cube connects opposite vertices. Let's consider the main diagonal connecting the vertex at the origin `(0,0,0)` to the opposite vertex `(1,1,1)`. This diagonal can be represented by the vector `D = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n*   **The Shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" can be interpreted in two primary ways:\n    1.  The **distance** of the shift is 1/2. The shift vector `v` would have a magnitude `||v|| = 1/2` and be in the direction of `D`. This would make `v = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))`. This leads to a complicated, irrational answer.\n    2.  The shift is a displacement by a vector that is `1/2` of the main diagonal vector `D`. The shift vector `v` would be `v = (1/2) * D = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This is a more common interpretation in geometry problems for its simplicity and clear geometric meaning (it places a vertex of one cube at the center of the other). This leads to a much cleaner answer.\n\nGiven the typical nature of such problems, we will proceed with the second interpretation, which is more likely the intended meaning.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Position of the Second Cube\nThe second cube, C2, is a translated copy of C1. The translation is given by the shift vector `v = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\nThis means that for every point `(x, y, z)` in C1, the point `(x + 1/2, y + 1/2, z + 1/2)` is in C2.\nApplying this shift to the boundaries of C1, we find the boundaries of C2:\n*   x-range: `[0 + 1/2, 1 + 1/2] = [1/2, 3/2]`\n*   y-range: `[0 + 1/2, 1 + 1/2] = [1/2, 3/2]`\n*   z-range: `[0 + 1/2, 1 + 1/2] = [1/2, 3/2]`\n\nSo, `C2 = { (x, y, z) | 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2, 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2 }`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Intersection of the Two Cubes\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point `(x, y, z)` belongs to both C1 and C2. We need to find the intersection of their respective coordinate intervals.\n\n*   **Intersection of x-intervals:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **Intersection of y-intervals:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **Intersection of z-intervals:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nThe intersection region is a smaller cube defined by these new intervals.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection\nThe intersection is a cube with boundaries `[1/2, 1] x [1/2, 1] x [1/2, 1]`.\nThe side length of this intersection cube is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\nThe volume of a cube is given by the formula `Volume = (side length)^3`.\nVolume of the intersection = `(1/2)^3 = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Coordinate System Choice:** Choosing `[0,1]^3` simplifies the arithmetic for defining the shifted cube.\n2.  **Ambiguity of the Phrase \"shifted by\":** This is the most critical point. The choice between interpreting \"by 1/2\" as a distance versus a parameter scaling the diagonal vector determines the outcome. The context of geometry problems strongly favors the simpler interpretation that leads to a rational answer (`1/8`).\n3.  **Shape of Intersection:** In this specific case (axis-aligned cubes and an axis-aligned shift), the intersection is also a cube. This simplifies the final volume calculation. If the cubes were rotated relative to each other, the intersection would be a more complex polyhedron.\n\nThe final answer is the volume of this smaller intersection cube.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
