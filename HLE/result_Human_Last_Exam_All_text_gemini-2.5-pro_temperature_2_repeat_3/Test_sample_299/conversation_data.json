    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of such functions. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 1: Basic properties of f**\n\nThe function $g(x) = e^x$ is continuous and strictly increasing. The given equation is $f \\circ f = g$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of f**: Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. By the given equation, this means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is one-to-one, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ is an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of f**: A function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is both continuous and injective must be strictly monotonic. This is a well-known result from real analysis. Thus, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nWe will analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**Step 2: Case 1: f is strictly decreasing**\n\nIf $f$ is a strictly decreasing function, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is a strictly increasing function. To see this, if $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ (since $f$ is decreasing). Applying $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$ (again, because $f$ is decreasing).\nThe function $g(x)=e^x$ is strictly increasing, so this case is potentially possible.\n\nLet's investigate the behavior of $f$ at infinity.\nSince $f$ is a decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, the limits $L = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ and $M = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ both exist (possibly as $\\pm \\infty$).\nBecause $f$ is decreasing, we have $M < L$. The range of $f$ is the open interval $(M, L)$.\n\nLet's consider the limit of the equation $f(f(x))=e^x$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\nThe right hand side is $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} e^x = \\infty$.\nFor the left hand side, let $y = f(x)$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $y \\to M$. Since $f$ is decreasing, the values $f(x)$ are always greater than $M$, so we can write this as $y \\to M^+$.\nSo, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y)$.\n\nBy continuity of $f$, if $M$ is a finite number, $\\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y) = f(M)$. For the limit to be $\\infty$, $f$ would need a vertical asymptote at $M$, which contradicts the condition that $f$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\nIf $M = -\\infty$, then we are evaluating $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = L$. For this to be $\\infty$, we must have $L=\\infty$.\n\nHowever, there is a more direct argument. The range of $f$ is $(M,L)$. For any $y$ in the domain of $f$, we have $f(y) < L$.\nThe limit we are considering, $\\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y)$, is the supremum of the values of $f$ on the interval $(M, \\infty)$.\nThis supremum must be less than or equal to the global supremum of $f$, which is $L$.\nSo, $\\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y) \\le L$.\nIf $L$ is a finite number, this leads to a contradiction, since the limit must be $\\infty$.\nIf $L=\\infty$, this doesn't immediately give a contradiction. However, in this case, $M$ must be finite or $-\\infty$. Let's analyze $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x))$. The RHS is $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} e^x=0$. The LHS is $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x))$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $y=f(x) \\to L^-$. Since $L=\\infty$, this means $y \\to \\infty$. So the limit becomes $\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} f(y) = M$.\nTherefore we must have $M=0$.\nSo for a decreasing solution to exist we must have $M=0$ and $L=\\infty$.\nThis means $f$ is a strictly decreasing function with range $(0, \\infty)$, i.e. $f(x)>0$ for all $x$.\nBut if $f(x) > 0$ for all $x$, then $f$ cannot be strictly decreasing from $L=\\infty$ to $M=0$. A decreasing function that is always positive must have a finite limit as $x \\to \\infty$, i.e., $M \\ge 0$. And as $x\\to-\\infty$, its limit $L$ must be finite or $\\infty$. In our case $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to (0, \\infty)$. So $f$ is a positive function.\nThe problem is that $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} f(y) = 0$ requires $f$ to be defined for arbitrarily large $y$. And $\\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y)=\\infty$ requires $f$ to be defined for $y$ near $M$. Since the range of $f$ is $(0,\\infty)$, the outer function $f$ in $f(f(x))$ only ever sees positive inputs. So, what happens at the limit is dictated by the behavior of $f$ on $(0,\\infty)$. $\\lim_{y\\to 0^+} f(y)=\\infty$. This implies a vertical asymptote at $y=0$, which contradicts the continuity of $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet's re-state the contradiction cleanly:\n1. Assume $f$ is continuous and strictly decreasing on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2. Let $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = M$. As $f$ is decreasing, for any $x$, $f(x) > M$.\n3. As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) \\to M$ from above. Let $y=f(x)$. So $y \\to M^+$.\n4. $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y)$.\n5. From the given equation, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} e^x = \\infty$.\n6. So, $\\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y) = \\infty$. This implies that $M$ cannot be in the domain of $f$, or $f$ is discontinuous at $M$.\n7. But the domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$. So $f$ must be continuous at $M$.\n8. Continuity at $M$ means $\\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y) = f(M)$, which is a finite value. This contradicts the conclusion that the limit is $\\infty$.\n9. Therefore, no such strictly decreasing function exists.\n\n**Step 3: Case 2: f is strictly increasing**\n\nIf $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with $e^x$.\nLet's see if we can construct such functions. A known method to find functional roots is to define the function on a particular interval and then use the given equation to extend it to the rest of the real line.\n\nLet's establish some key values.\nSuppose $f(0)=c$. Then $f(c)=f(f(0)) = e^0=1$.\nThen $f(1)=f(f(c)) = e^c$.\nAlso, if $f(a)=0$, then $f(0)=f(f(a)) = e^a$. So $c=e^a$, which implies $a = \\ln c$.\nSince $f$ is strictly increasing and $f(a)=0$ while $f(0)=c$, if $a<0$, then $c>0$. And if $c>0$, $a=\\ln c$ is defined.\nLet's analyze the range of $f$. As shown in the argument for the decreasing case, the limit analysis for $f(f(x))$ is key.\nLet $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = a$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)=b$. The range is $(a,b)$.\n$\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = f(a)$ (by continuity). The RHS is $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} e^x = 0$. So $f(a)=0$.\n$\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y)$. The RHS is $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} e^x = \\infty$. This implies $b$ must be a point where $f$ tends to infinity. For a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, this means $b=\\infty$.\nSo, an increasing solution must satisfy:\n1. $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)=\\infty$.\n2. $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)=a$ for some finite $a$.\n3. $f(a)=0$.\nSince $f$ is strictly increasing and its range is $(a, \\infty)$, we must have $f(x)>a$ for all $x$. In particular, $f(a)>a$. Since $f(a)=0$, this implies $0>a$.\n\nThis structure is consistent. Now we show that we have freedom in constructing such functions. The standard method for this problem is as follows:\n1.  Choose a value for $c = f(0)$. From the condition $0>a=\\ln c$, we must have $c=e^a<e^0=1$. Also, as $f(x)>a$ for all $x$, $f(0)=c>a=\\ln c$, which is true for all $c>0$. Finally, $f(a)=0$ and $f$ is increasing, so $a<0 \\implies f(a)<f(0) \\implies 0<c$. Thus, we can choose any $c \\in (0,1)$. The number of choices for $c$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n2.  For a fixed $c \\in (0,1)$, we have the points $(0,c)$ and $(c,1)$ on the graph of $f$. We can define $f$ on the interval $[0, c]$ as an arbitrary continuous and strictly increasing function $\\phi$ such that $\\phi(0)=c$ and $\\phi(c)=1$. A function that maps an interval to another in this way is a homeomorphism between the intervals.\n3.  How many such functions $\\phi$ are there? Consider $\\phi(x) = c + (1-c)\\psi(x/c)$, where $\\psi$ is any homeomorphism from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$. There are $\\mathfrak{c}$ such homeomorphisms $\\psi$. For instance, for any $k \\ge 1$, the function $\\psi_k(t) = t^k / (t^k + (1-t)^k)$ (for suitable normalization) or simply considering mixtures like $(1-s)t+st^2$ for $s\\in[0,1]$ gives a continuum of choices. The set of such homeomorphisms has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n4.  Once $f$ is defined on $[0, c]$, its definition can be uniquely extended to the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    - For $x \\in (c, 1]$, we can write $x = f(y)$ for a unique $y \\in (0,c]$ ($y=f^{-1}(x)=\\phi^{-1}(x)$). Then we must define $f(x) = f(f(y)) = e^y = e^{\\phi^{-1}(x)}$.\n    - This process can be continued to define $f$ for all $x \\ge 0$.\n    - For $x \\in (a, 0] = (\\ln c, 0]$, $e^x \\in (c, 1]$. On this interval, $f(x)$ must be mapped by $f$ to $e^x$. The values $f(x)$ for an increasing function on $(\\ln c, 0]$ must be in $(f(\\ln c), f(0)] = (0, c]$. On $(0,c]$, $f$ is our chosen function $\\phi$. So we must have $\\phi(f(x)) = e^x$, which implies $f(x) = \\phi^{-1}(e^x)$.\n    - This process can also be continued backwards to define $f$ for all $x<a$.\n\nSo, a solution $f$ is uniquely determined by a pair $(c, \\phi)$, where $c \\in (0,1)$ and $\\phi$ is an increasing homeomorphism from $[0,c]$ to $[c,1]$.\nThe number of choices for $c$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nThe number of choices for $\\phi$ for any given $c$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nThe total number of increasing solutions is the cardinality of the set of these pairs, which is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe set $S$ of all continuous solutions to $f(f(x))=e^x$ is the union of the set of strictly decreasing solutions ($S_{dec}$) and the set of strictly increasing solutions ($S_{inc}$).\n- We showed that $S_{dec}$ is the empty set.\n- We showed that $|S_{inc}| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\nTherefore, $|S| = |S_{dec}| + |S_{inc}| = 0 + \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of such functions is the cardinality of the continuum."
