    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the definitions and properties related to Calabi-Yau links and the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Crawley-Nordström Invariant (CNI)**\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for a link defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial $W(z_1, ..., z_n)$ is a rational number. It is calculated using the weights $(w_1, ..., w_n)$ of the ambient space and the degree $d$ of the polynomial.\nThe formula for the invariant is:\n$CNI = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1 - 2q_i}{2}$\nwhere $n$ is the number of variables, and $q_i = w_i/d$ are the \"charges\" of the variables.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Given Parameters**\nFrom the question, we can extract the following information:\n*   **Polynomial:** $W = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n*   **Number of variables:** $n = 5$ (since we have $z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5$).\n*   **Weights:** $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Degree of the Polynomial**\nFor the polynomial to be quasi-homogeneous, all its monomial terms must have the same weighted degree. The weighted degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}...z_n^{a_n}$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i w_i$. Let's calculate this for each term in $W$:\n*   $z_1^8z_3$: Degree = $8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8(22) + 1(49) = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n*   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: Degree = $4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4(22) + 3(29) + 1(49) = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n*   $z_1z_2^7$: Degree = $1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1(22) + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n*   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: Degree = $w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$.\n*   $z_2z_3^4$: Degree = $1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 1(29) + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n*   $z_4^3z_5$: Degree = $3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3(50) + 1(75) = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $z_5^3$: Degree = $3 \\cdot w_5 = 3(75) = 225$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** There is an inconsistency. The second monomial has a weighted degree of 224, while all other six monomials have a weighted degree of 225. A key requirement for defining the Crawley-Nordström invariant in this context is that the polynomial must be quasi-homogeneous, meaning all terms share the same degree. Given that the problem refers to a \"Calabi-Yau Link\" and that the vast majority of terms (6 out of 7) point to a single degree, we can confidently assume that the second term contains a typographical error and that the intended degree of the polynomial is $d = 225$. The calculation of the CNI only depends on the weights and the degree, not the specific coefficients or monomial structure, so this assumption allows us to proceed.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition**\nA hypersurface in a weighted projective space is considered Calabi-Yau if the sum of its weights is equal to the degree of the defining polynomial. That is, $\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = d$.\n*   Sum of weights: $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n*   Degree of polynomial: $d = 225$ (based on our deduction in Step 3).\nSince $\\sum w_i = d = 225$, the Calabi-Yau condition is satisfied.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\nWe use the formula from Step 1:\n$CNI = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1 - 2q_i}{2}$\n\nWe can rewrite this expression:\n$CNI = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1 - 2q_i) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 - 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} q_i \\right)$\n$CNI = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( n - 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{w_i}{d} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( n - \\frac{2}{d} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\right)$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** For any Calabi-Yau case where $\\sum w_i = d$, the formula for the CNI simplifies significantly.\nSubstituting $\\sum w_i = d$ into the equation:\n$CNI = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( n - \\frac{2}{d} \\cdot d \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (n - 2)$\n\nNow, we just need to plug in the number of variables, $n=5$:\n$CNI = \\frac{5 - 2}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is 3/2 or 1.5.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n1.  **Identify weights and variable count:** $w=(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$ and $n=5$.\n2.  **Determine the degree `d`:** Check weighted degrees of all monomials. All but one are 225. Assume $d=225$.\n3.  **Check Calabi-Yau condition:** $\\sum w_i = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$. Since $\\sum w_i = d$, the condition is met.\n4.  **Apply simplified CNI formula:** For Calabi-Yau manifolds, $CNI = (n-2)/2$.\n5.  **Calculate:** $CNI = (5-2)/2 = 3/2$.\n\n<<<3/2>>>"
