    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe problem asks for a scaling exponent within the context of the renormalization group (RG) theory, specifically using the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. This method is used to calculate critical exponents for systems near their upper critical dimension, $d_c$. The system is in a spatial dimension $d=3$.\n\n**2. Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$) and the Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$)**\n\n*   The epsilon expansion is applied to a Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson (or $\\phi^4$) theory, which describes the universality classes of common continuous phase transitions (like the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models).\n*   For this class of theories, the interaction term ($u\\phi^4$) becomes marginal, meaning its coupling constant $u$ becomes dimensionless, at the **upper critical dimension $d_c = 4$**.\n*   The epsilon expansion uses $\\epsilon = d_c - d$ as a small parameter.\n*   For the given spatial dimension $d=3$, the parameter $\\epsilon$ is:\n    $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n    *Careful Point*: Although $\\epsilon=1$ is not formally a small parameter, the $\\epsilon$-expansion is often used as a systematic approximation scheme even for $d=3$. The result will be the first-order approximation in this expansion.\n\n**3. Relate the Specific Heat Exponent ($\\alpha$) to other Exponents**\n\nThe scaling exponents are not all independent. They are related by \"hyperscaling relations\" which are predicted to hold by RG theory. The specific heat exponent, $\\alpha$, is related to the correlation length exponent, $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension, $d$, by the Josephson identity:\n$d\\nu = 2 - \\alpha$\nRearranging for $\\alpha$, we get:\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\nTo find $\\alpha$, we first need to find the expression for $\\nu$ in the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n**4. Find the Correlation Length Exponent ($\\nu$) from the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\n*   Within the RG framework for the O(n) model (where 'n' is the number of components of the order parameter, e.g., n=1 for the Ising model), the one-loop calculation for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ yields:\n    $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n*   *Careful Point*: This expression depends on 'n'. Since the problem refers to \"a system\" without specifying the model, it is standard practice to assume the most fundamental case, which is the **Ising model universality class (n=1)**. This corresponds to systems with a single scalar order parameter (e.g., liquid-gas transition, uniaxial magnet).\n\n**5. Derive the Expression for $\\alpha$ in the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $d=4-\\epsilon$ and the one-loop result for $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n\nExpand this expression, keeping only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$ ($O(\\epsilon)$):\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ (4)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (4)\\left(\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right) - (\\epsilon)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nCombine the terms in the parenthesis:\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - (n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2n + 4 - n - 8}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n - 4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Value for $\\alpha$**\n\n*   **Select n**: As discussed in Step 4, we assume the Ising model, so we set **n = 1**.\n*   **Substitute n and $\\epsilon$**: We use $n=1$ and the value $\\epsilon = 1$ (for $d=3$).\n\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} (1)$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{2(9)}$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{18}$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Final Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Correct Model**: The problem implicitly refers to the $\\phi^4$ or O(n) universality class.\n*   **Correct Dimensions**: The calculation starts from the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$ to find $\\epsilon=4-d$.\n*   **Correct Hyperscaling**: The Josephson identity $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$ is essential.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy**: The expansion of $\\alpha = 2-(4-\\epsilon)\\nu$ must be done carefully to first order in $\\epsilon$.\n*   **Justified Assumption**: A choice must be made for the spin dimensionality 'n'. The Ising model (n=1) is the canonical choice for such generally phrased questions.\n*   **Interpretation**: The result is a first-order approximation. Using $\\epsilon=1$ is an extrapolation, but it's the standard procedure for answering this type of question.\n\nThe final answer, to first order in the epsilon expansion, is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
