    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet & Act:** *Don Quixote*, Act I variation\n*   **Specific Step:** A sequence of \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Specific Ballet Step**\n*   **Fifth Position:** A standard ballet position where the feet are turned out, with the heel of the front foot placed against the toe of the back foot.\n*   **Pirouette en dehors:** An outward turn on one leg, away from the supporting leg. A \"single-turn\" means one 360-degree rotation.\n*   **The Sequence:** The question asks for the number of times Osipova performed this specific sequence: start in fifth position, execute one outward turn, and presumably land back in fifth to repeat. This is a classic training exercise but is distinct from other famous ballet turns.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of Kitri's Act I Variation**\n*   Kitri's variation in Act I of *Don Quixote* (often performed with a fan) is a famous solo known for its technical brilliance, speed, and Spanish character.\n*   The standard choreography for this variation, particularly the version used by the Bolshoi Ballet based on Alexander Gorsky's staging, features several key turning sequences. These are:\n    1.  **A diagonal of piqué turns:** These are sharp, traveling turns where the dancer steps directly onto pointe. They do not start from a closed fifth position for each rotation.\n    2.  **A manège (circle) of turns:** Near the end of the variation, Kitri typically travels in a circle around the stage, often with fast chaîné turns or more piqué turns.\n    3.  **Multiple pirouettes:** Dancers may insert double or triple pirouettes as part of a phrase, but not a repetitive series of single turns.\n*   The famous 32 fouetté turns, which are another iconic turning sequence for Kitri, occur in the Coda of the Grand Pas de Deux in Act III, not in the Act I variation.\n\n**Step 4: Scrutinize Performances by Natalia Osipova**\n*   Watching recordings of Natalia Osipova performing this role with the Bolshoi Ballet from that period (circa 2007-2008) confirms that she performed the standard, technically demanding choreography.\n*   Her Act I variation includes the characteristic piqué turns and the fast manège. There is no section in her performance, or in the standard choreography of this variation, that consists of a repeated sequence of \"single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position\".\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\n*   The specific step described in the question—a series of individual single pirouettes, each initiated from a closed fifth position—is a fundamental training exercise.\n*   This particular sequence is not part of the established, professional choreography for Kitri's Act I variation in *Don Quixote*. It lacks the bravura, momentum, and theatrical flair of the steps that are actually performed (piqué turns, chaînés, multiple pirouettes).\n*   Since the described sequence of steps is not performed in the variation, the number of times Osipova would have executed it is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
