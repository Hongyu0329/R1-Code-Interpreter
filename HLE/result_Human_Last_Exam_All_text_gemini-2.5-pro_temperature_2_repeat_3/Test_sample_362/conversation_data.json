    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: Pivalaldehyde.** The \"pivaloyl\" or \"pival\" prefix refers to the tert-butyl group, `(CH₃)₃C-`, attached to a carbonyl. Since it's an aldehyde, its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`.\n\n    ```\n          CH₃\n          |\n    CH₃ - C - CHO\n          |\n          CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Reactant 2: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.** This is a phosphorus ylide, the key reagent in a Wittig reaction. Let's determine its structure from the name:\n    *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane` refers to the `(C₆H₅)₃P=` or `Ph₃P=` core.\n    *   `ethylidene` refers to a two-carbon group attached by a double bond, originating from ethane. In the context of an ylide `Ph₃P=CR¹R²`, this usually refers to `Ph₃P=CHCH₃`.\n    *   `2-(2-chlorophenyl)` is a substituent on the `ethylidene` group. Let's number the ethylidene carbons: `P=C¹H-C²H₃`. The substituent is at position 2.\n    *   The substituent is `2-chlorophenyl`, which is a phenyl ring with a chlorine atom at the ortho position relative to the point of attachment.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the ylide structure is `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`.\n\n*   **Reaction Type: Wittig Reaction.** This reaction couples an aldehyde or ketone with a phosphorus ylide to form an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The carbonyl oxygen `(=O)` is replaced by the alkylidene group of the ylide `(=CRR')`.\n\n**2. Determine the Connectivity of the Product**\n\nThe Wittig reaction will form a new carbon-carbon double bond between the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde and the nucleophilic carbon of the ylide.\n\n*   From pivalaldehyde, `(CH₃)₃C-CH=O`, we take the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` fragment.\n*   From the ylide, `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`, we take the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)` fragment.\n\nCombining them gives the product's structure: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`. The byproduct is triphenylphosphine oxide, `(C₆H₅)₃P=O`.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product (E/Z Isomerism)**\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n\n*   **Ylide Classification:** The ylide `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-Ar` has an alkyl-type group (`-CH₂-Ar`, a 2-chlorobenzyl group) attached to the ylide carbon. The `CH₂` group isolates the carbanionic carbon from any potential resonance stabilization from the phenyl ring. Therefore, this is classified as an **unstabilized ylide**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** Unstabilized ylides typically react with aldehydes under standard conditions via a kinetically controlled pathway to yield the **Z-alkene** (or cis-alkene) as the major product. The transition state leading to the cis-oxaphosphetane intermediate (which decomposes to the Z-alkene) is lower in energy because it minimizes steric repulsion between the bulky substituents on the aldehyde (`-C(CH₃)₃`) and the phosphorus atom (`-P(C₆H₅)₃`).\n\n*   **Assigning E/Z Configuration:**\n    1.  We need to assign priorities to the substituents on each carbon of the double bond using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    2.  On the carbon from pivalaldehyde: `-(CH₃)₃C` (high priority) and `-H` (low priority).\n    3.  On the carbon from the ylide: `-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)` (high priority) and `-H` (low priority).\n    4.  The **Z-isomer** is the one where the two high-priority groups (`-C(CH₃)₃` and `-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`) are on the *same side* of the double bond.\n\n    The structure of the major product (Z-isomer) is:\n    ```\n          (CH₃)₃C         CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)\n                 \\       /\n                  C === C\n                 /       \\\n                H         H\n    ```\n\n**4. Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Find the parent chain:** The longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    `(C₆H₄-2-Cl)-CH₂(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-C(4)(CH₃)₂-CH₃(5)`\n    This is a 5-carbon chain, so the parent name is derived from `pentene`.\n2.  **Number the chain:** Numbering from left-to-right (as shown above) gives the double bond the locant 2 (`pent-2-ene`). Numbering from the other direction gives the locant 3 (`pent-3-ene`). We choose the numbering that gives the double bond the lowest locant.\n3.  **Identify and name the substituents:**\n    *   At position C1: a `2-chlorophenyl` group.\n    *   At position C4: two `methyl` groups, so `4,4-dimethyl`.\n4.  **Assemble the name:** Combining the stereochemistry, substituents, and parent chain name gives the final name.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
