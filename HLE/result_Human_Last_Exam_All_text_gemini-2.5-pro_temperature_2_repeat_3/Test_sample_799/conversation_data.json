    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set `A` of real numbers is called a Sidon set if the equation `a + b = c + d` with `a, b, c, d ∈ A` implies that the pair of elements `{a, b}` is the same as the pair `{c, d}`. In other words, either (`a=c` and `b=d`) or (`a=d` and `b=c`). This property implies that all sums of two elements are unique, up to the order of the summands. Sidon sets are also known as B2-sets. Intuitively, Sidon sets must be \"arithmetically sparse.\" For instance, an interval `[x, x+ε]` is not a Sidon set, because we can find distinct `a, b, c, d` in it such that `a+b=c+d` (e.g., `a=x`, `b=x+ε`, `c=x+ε/3`, `d=x+2ε/3`).\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, `dim_H(S)`, is a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension of a set `S`. It generalizes the concept of dimension to non-integer values. For sets in `[0, 1]`, the Hausdorff dimension can be any real number between 0 and 1. It is a measure of the metric \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the set.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible value of `dim_H(A)` where `A ⊂ [0, 1]` is a Sidon set. We will find this value by establishing a lower bound (by construction) and an upper bound (by a theorem).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Establishing a Lower Bound (The Supremum is at least 1/2)**\n\nWe can construct Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimension arbitrarily close to `1/2`. The construction method builds a fractal set of the Cantor type.\n\n1.  **Cantor-like Construction:** A standard way to construct a fractal set is as `C = { Σ_{k=1}^∞ d_k M^{-k} | d_k ∈ D }`, where `D` is a finite set of integer \"digits\" and `M` is an integer base (`M > max(D)`). The Hausdorff dimension of such a set `C` is given by `dim_H(C) = log(|D|) / log(M)`, where `|D|` is the number of digits.\n\n2.  **Enforcing the Sidon Property:** Let `x, y, z, w` be four points in our constructed set `C`. Let their digit representations be `x = Σ x_k M^{-k}`, `y = Σ y_k M^{-k}`, etc., where all digits `x_k, y_k, z_k, w_k` belong to the set `D`. The equation `x + y = z + w` can be written in terms of digits:\n    `Σ (x_k + y_k) M^{-k} = Σ (z_k + w_k) M^{-k}`\n\n3.  **Avoiding Carries:** We can choose the base `M` to be large enough to prevent \"carries\" in the base-`M` addition. If we choose `M > 2 * max(D)`, then for any `d_1, d_2 ∈ D`, the sum `d_1 + d_2` will be less than `M`. This means the base-`M` representation of `x+y` is unique, with digits `(x_k + y_k)`. Thus, the equality `x+y=z+w` holds if and only if `x_k + y_k = z_k + w_k` for all `k ≥ 1`.\n\n4.  **Connecting to Integer Sidon Sets:** If we choose the digit set `D` to be a Sidon set of integers, then the condition `x_k + y_k = z_k + w_k` (with all digits in `D`) implies `{x_k, y_k} = {z_k, w_k}` for each `k`. This in turn implies `{x, y} = {z, w}`. Therefore, the constructed set `C` is a Sidon set of real numbers.\n\n5.  **Maximizing the Dimension:** To get the largest possible dimension `log(|D|) / log(M)`, we need to choose an integer Sidon set `D` that is as large as possible for a given range, which determines `M`. It is a classical result in combinatorial number theory that for any large `N`, there exist Sidon sets `D ⊂ {0, 1, ..., N-1}` of size `|D|` close to `N^(1/2)`.\n    *   Let's choose such a Sidon set `D_N` with `|D_N| ≈ N^(1/2)` and `max(D_N) < N`.\n    *   To prevent carries, we must choose our base `M > 2 * max(D_N)`, so we can take `M = 2N`.\n    *   The Hausdorff dimension of the resulting Sidon set `C_N` is `dim_H(C_N) = log(|D_N|) / log(M) ≈ log(N^(1/2)) / log(2N)`.\n    *   Let's analyze this as `N → ∞`:\n        `lim_{N→∞} (log(N^(1/2)) / log(2N)) = lim_{N→∞} ( (1/2)log(N) / (log(2) + log(N)) ) = 1/2`.\n\nThis construction shows that for any `ε > 0`, we can find a Sidon set `A ⊂ [0,1]` with `dim_H(A) > 1/2 - ε`. Therefore, the maximum (supremum) of the possible dimensions must be at least `1/2`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Establishing an Upper Bound (The Dimension is at most 1/2)**\n\nThis is a deep and non-trivial theorem in harmonic analysis.\n\n**Theorem (Lyons, Peyrière, Körner):** If `A` is a Sidon set of real numbers, then its Hausdorff dimension `dim_H(A)` cannot exceed `1/2`.\n\n**Sketch of the Proof Idea:**\n1.  Assume for contradiction that `dim_H(A) = s > 1/2`.\n2.  By Frostman's Lemma, this assumption implies the existence of a probability measure `μ` supported on `A` whose `s`-energy integral is finite: `I_s(μ) = ∫∫ |x-y|^{-s} dμ(x)dμ(y) < ∞`.\n3.  The finiteness of the energy integral is equivalent (for `0<s<1`) to a certain decay rate of the Fourier transform `hat(μ)(t) = ∫ e^{-2πixt} dμ(x)`. Specifically, it implies that `∫|t|^(s-1) |hat(μ)(t)|^2 dt < ∞`. Since `s > 1/2`, `s-1 > -1/2`, which forces `|hat(μ)(t)|^2` to decay at a certain rate as `|t| → ∞`.\n4.  Separately, the Sidon property of the set `A` imposes a strong structural constraint on the Fourier transform of any measure `μ` supported on it. It can be shown that `∫|hat(μ)(t)|^4 dt` is bounded, which intuitively means `hat(μ)(t)` cannot decay \"too quickly\".\n5.  A careful analysis shows that the rapid decay of `hat(μ)` required by the `dim_H(A) > 1/2` assumption contradicts the slower decay allowed by the Sidon property. This contradiction proves that the initial assumption must be false.\n\nTherefore, for any Sidon set `A`, we must have `dim_H(A) ≤ 1/2`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   From Step 2, we can construct Sidon sets in `[0,1]` with Hausdorff dimension arbitrarily close to `1/2`. This means the maximum possible dimension is at least `1/2`.\n*   From Step 3, we have a theorem stating that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set cannot be greater than `1/2`.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in `[0,1]` is exactly `1/2`.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
