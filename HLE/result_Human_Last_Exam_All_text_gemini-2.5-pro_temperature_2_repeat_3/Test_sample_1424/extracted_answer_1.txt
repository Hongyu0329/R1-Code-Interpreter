The bare Green's function $G_0$ in frequency-momentum space has the functional form of a simple pole with respect to the single-particle energy $\epsilon_k$. Its mathematical expression is $G_0(k, i\omega_n) = \frac{1}{i\omega_n - (\epsilon_k - \mu)}$, which shows that $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a linear function of $\epsilon_k$. The position of the pole in the complex energy plane is located at the particle's energy, $\epsilon_k - \mu$.
