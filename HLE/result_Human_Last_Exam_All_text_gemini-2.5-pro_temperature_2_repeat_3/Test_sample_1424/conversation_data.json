    "This analysis proceeds step-by-step to determine the functional dependence of the bare Green's function ($G_0$) on single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) using the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Preliminary Definitions and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Feynman Path Integral Formalism**: This framework is used to compute quantum mechanical amplitudes and correlation functions by summing over all possible \"histories\" or \"paths\" of a system. For many-body systems, this involves functional integrals over fields (e.g., Grassmann fields for fermions).\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**: This is the propagator, or two-point correlation function, for a *non-interacting* system. It describes the amplitude for a particle created at one spacetime point to propagate to another without being affected by other particles. It is the fundamental building block for perturbative calculations in interacting theories.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)**: This implies that the non-interacting Hamiltonian ($H_0$) is diagonal in a basis indexed by `k` (e.g., momentum), with $\\epsilon_k$ being the energy of the state `k`. This is the natural basis for describing free particles.\n*   **Key Variables**: The calculation is most conveniently performed in imaginary time ($\\tau$) and then Fourier transformed to frequency space. This introduces the Matsubara frequencies ($i\\omega_n$). For generality, we must also include the chemical potential ($\\mu$), which sets the reference energy level. The relevant energy is typically the energy measured relative to the chemical potential, $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$.\n\n**2. The Action for a Non-Interacting System ($S_0$)**\n\nWe consider a system of non-interacting fermions (the final result for bosons is structurally identical). The Hamiltonian is $H_0 = \\sum_k (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_k^\\dagger c_k$, where $c_k^\\dagger$ and $c_k$ are fermionic creation and annihilation operators.\n\nIn the path integral formalism, this Hamiltonian corresponds to the following imaginary-time action, written in terms of anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\\psi_k(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau)$:\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\nHere, $\\beta = 1/k_B T$ is the inverse temperature. A crucial point is that this action is diagonal in the index `k`, meaning the different modes are decoupled and can be treated independently.\n\n**3. Transformation to Frequency Space**\n\nTo solve the path integral, we transform the fields to frequency space (Matsubara representation). The derivative $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$, where $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$ for fermions. The action simplifies to a purely algebraic form:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_{k,n}$\n\nThis expression clearly shows that the action is a sum of independent quadratic terms, one for each pair of indices $(k,n)$.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nBy definition, the bare Green's function in frequency space is the Fourier transform of the time-ordered two-point correlator, conventionally defined with a negative sign:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = -\\langle \\psi_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} \\rangle_0$\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ is computed via the path integral. For a quadratic action of the form $S_0 = \\sum \\bar{\\psi} M \\psi$, the correlation function $\\langle \\psi \\bar{\\psi} \\rangle$ is simply the inverse of the matrix $M$. In our case, the \"matrix\" $M$ is diagonal, with elements $M_{k,n} = (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu)$.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value is:\n$\\langle \\psi_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} \\rangle_0 = (M_{k,n})^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu}$\n\nPlugging this into the definition for $G_0$:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = - \\left( \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu} \\right)$\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n**5. Final Answer: The Functional Dependence**\n\nThe final expression $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\xi_k}$, where $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$, reveals the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n*   **Inverse Linear Relationship**: The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$. For a given frequency $i\\omega_n$ and chemical potential $\\mu$, the dependence takes the form $G_0 \\propto (A - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, where $A$ is a constant.\n\n*   **Simple Pole Structure**: This mathematical form is known as a simple pole. If the frequency variable were a continuous complex energy $z$, the Green's function $G_0(k, z) = \\frac{1}{z - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$ would have a single pole on the real axis at the energy of the particle, $z = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$. This pole signifies the existence of a stable particle with a well-defined energy. Interactions in a more complex theory modify this simple pole structure, giving the particle a finite lifetime (an imaginary part to the pole's location) and shifting its energy.\n\nIn summary, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalue is that of a simple pole, where the pole's location is determined directly by the energy eigenvalue.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ in frequency-momentum space has the functional form of a simple pole with respect to the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$. Its mathematical expression is $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$, which shows that $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$. The position of the pole in the complex energy plane is located at the particle's energy, $\\epsilon_k - \\mu$.>>>"
