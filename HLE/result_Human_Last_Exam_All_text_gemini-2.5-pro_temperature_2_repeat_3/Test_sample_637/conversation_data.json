    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer gain matrix.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to design a state observer for the given discrete-time system. The observer should be \"deadbeat,\" which means the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` must become identically zero (`e(k) = 0`) in the shortest possible number of time steps and remain zero thereafter.\n\n### **Step 2: Observer Dynamics and Error Equation**\n\nA full-order state observer is described by the equation:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = A * x_hat(k) + B * u(k) + L * (y(k) - C * x_hat(k))`\nwhere `x_hat(k)` is the estimated state and `L` is the observer gain matrix to be designed.\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` can be derived as follows:\n`e(k + 1) = x(k + 1) - x_hat(k + 1)`\n`e(k + 1) = (Ax(k) + Bu(k)) - (A*x_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(Cx(k) - Cx_hat(k)))`\n`e(k + 1) = A(x(k) - x_hat(k)) - LC(x(k) - x_hat(k))`\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\n### **Step 3: Condition for Deadbeat Observer**\n\nFor the error `e(k)` to become zero in a finite number of steps, the error dynamics matrix, `A_o = A - LC`, must be a nilpotent matrix. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of `A - LC` at the origin (0). The characteristic polynomial of `A - LC` must be `z^n = 0`, where `n` is the dimension of the state vector (`n=4` in this case).\nSo, the desired characteristic polynomial is `det(zI - (A - LC)) = z^4`.\n\nThe shortest possible time for the error to converge to zero is given by the observability index, `v`, of the system pair `(A, C)`. This problem asks for this shortest time convergence, which means we must design `L` such that the minimal polynomial of `A-LC` is `z^v`. As a prerequisite, the characteristic polynomial must be `z^4`.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculation of the Observer Gain `L`**\n\nWe need to find the `4x2` matrix `L` such that the characteristic polynomial of `A - LC` is `z^4`. Let `L = [l_ij]`.\nThe matrix `C` is `[1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`.\n`LC = [l11 l12; l21 l22; l31 l32; l41 l42] * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] = [l11+l12, 0, 0, l12; l21+l22, 0, 0, l22; l31+l32, 0, 0, l32; l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]`\n\n`A - LC =`\n`[ -1-(l11+l12),  0,   0,   1-l12;`\n`   1-(l21+l22),  0,   0,   2-l22;`\n`  -(l31+l32),   1,   0,  -1-l32;`\n`  -1-(l41+l42),  0,   1,  -1-l42 ]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial `det(zI - (A-LC))` is then calculated:\n`det([ z+1+l11+l12,  0,    0,   -1+l12;`\n`       -1+l21+l22,  z,    0,   -2+l22;`\n`       l31+l32,     -1,   z,   1+l32;`\n`       1+l41+l42,   0,    -1,  z+1+l42 ]) = z^4`\n\nExpanding this determinant leads to a quartic polynomial in `z`. We then set the coefficients of `z^3`, `z^2`, `z^1`, and `z^0` to zero. This results in a system of 4 equations with 8 unknown `l_ij` variables. Since the system is underdetermined, we can make simplifying assumptions to find one possible solution.\n\nLet's try to simplify the structure of `A - LC` by setting its top-right element to zero.\n`1 - l12 = 0` => `l12 = 1`\n\nWith `l12 = 1`, the characteristic polynomial `det(zI - (A-LC))` becomes:\n`(z+2+l11) * det([z, 0, -2+l22; -1, z, 1+l32; 0, -1, z+1+l42])`\nExpanding this yields:\n`char(z) = z^4 + (l11+l42+3)z^3 + (l32+1+(l11+2)(l42+1))z^2 + (l22-2+(l11+2)(l32+1))z + (l11+2)(l22-2)`\n\nWe set this equal to `z^4`:\n1.  `z^3` coeff: `l11+l42+3 = 0`\n2.  `z^2` coeff: `l32+1+(l11+2)(l42+1) = 0`\n3.  `z^1` coeff: `l22-2+(l11+2)(l32+1) = 0`\n4.  `z^0` coeff: `(l11+2)(l22-2) = 0`\n\nFrom (4), we have two cases: `l11 = -2` or `l22 = 2`.\n*   **Case 1: `l11 = -2`**\n    Substitute `l11 = -2` into (1): `-2+l42+3 = 0` => `l42 = -1`.\n    Substitute `l11 = -2` into (2): `l32+1+(-2+2)(l42+1) = 0` => `l32+1 = 0` => `l32 = -1`.\n    Substitute `l11 = -2` into (3): `l22-2+(-2+2)(l32+1) = 0` => `l22-2 = 0` => `l22 = 2`.\n\nThis solution is consistent. We have found the values for the second column of `L` and some for the first column:\n`l11 = -2`, `l12 = 1`, `l22 = 2`, `l32 = -1`, `l42 = -1`.\nThe remaining unknowns (`l21`, `l31`, `l41`) do not appear in the equations. We can set them to the simplest values, which is 0.\n`l21 = 0`, `l31 = 0`, `l41 = 0`.\n\nThis gives us the complete observer gain matrix `L`.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\nCombining the determined values:\n`L = [l11 l12; l21 l22; l31 l32; l41 l42] = [-2 1; 0 2; 0 -1; 0 -1]`\nThis observer places all eigenvalues of the error system at the origin, thus ensuring the error converges to zero."
