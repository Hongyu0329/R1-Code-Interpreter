    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Pronunciation and Moraic Structure**\nThe word is 「弟」.\nIts standard Japanese pronunciation is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\nIn Japanese pitch accent, the unit of rhythm is the mora (拍, haku). Let's break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n*   お (o) - 1st mora\n*   と (to) - 2nd mora\n*   う (u) - 3rd mora (This is part of the long vowel \"tou\")\n*   と (to) - 4th mora\nSo, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Types of Pitch Accent**\nJapanese pitch accent involves a drop in pitch. The location of this drop (or the lack thereof) defines the pattern.\n*   **A. Heiban (平板)**: The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. Crucially, a particle following the word (like が, は, の) also remains high. There is no pitch drop. This is often denoted as a [0] accent.\n    *   Example: さかな (sa-KA-NA), さかなが (sa-KA-NA-GA)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高)**: The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second. All subsequent morae and the following particle are low. This is a [1] accent.\n    *   Example: いのち (I-no-chi), いのちが (I-no-chi-ga)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and drops somewhere in the middle of the word. The particle following the word is low. The number in brackets, e.g., [2], [3], indicates the mora *before* the drop.\n    *   Example: あなた (a-NA-ta), あなたが (a-NA-ta-ga). This is a [2] accent for a 3-mora word.\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows. The bracket number is equal to the number of morae in the word.\n    *   Example: やま (ya-MA), やまが (ya-MA-ga). This is a [2] accent for a 2-mora word.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Pitch of 「弟」 (おとうと)**\nIn standard Japanese (based on the Tokyo dialect), the pitch of 「おとうと」 follows this pattern:\n*   お (low) - とうと (high)\n*   Pronounced as: o(L) to(H) u(H) to(H)\n\nNow, let's see what happens when a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached:\n*   おとうとが (otouto ga)\n*   The pitch remains high on the particle: o(L) to(H) u(H) to(H) ga(H)\n\n**Step 4: Match the Pattern to a Category**\nThe pattern observed in Step 3 is:\n*   Starts low, rises on the second mora.\n*   Stays high through the end of the word.\n*   Stays high on the following particle.\nThis is the definition of the **Heiban (平板)** pattern. In numerical notation, this is an accent of type [0].\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Mora vs. Syllable:** Pitch accent is based on morae, not syllables. The long vowel `ou` (おう) in `otouto` is two morae (`o` and `u`), not one syllable.\n2.  **Particle Test:** The key difference between the Heiban and Odaka patterns is revealed by adding a particle. In Heiban, the particle is high. In Odaka, the particle is low. For `otouto`, `otouto GA` is high, confirming it's not Odaka.\n3.  **Regional Variation:** Pitch accent can vary by region in Japan. The question asks for the \"standard\" pattern, which is based on the Tokyo dialect. In some other dialects, like Kansai, the pattern might be different.\n4.  **Dictionaries:** Authoritative sources like the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典 (NHK Japanese Pronunciation Accent Dictionary) list 「弟」 (おとうと) as `おとうと￣` or `[0]`, both of which denote the Heiban pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the word 「弟」 (otouto) has a Heiban pitch accent pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
