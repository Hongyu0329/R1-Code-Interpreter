    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe chemical name provided is `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. By searching for this complex chemical name, we can find its more common name. This compound is widely known as **Rhodamine B**. Its Colour Index Generic Name is **C.I. Basic Violet 10**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Properties of the Compound**\nRhodamine B is a synthetic dye known for its vibrant color and fluorescent properties. In solution, it has a brilliant reddish-violet or magenta color. Interestingly, in its solid, crystalline form, it can appear as green crystals. This dual nature of its appearance is a key point.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Compound to Crayola Crayon Pigments**\nCrayola's specific pigment formulas are proprietary trade secrets. Therefore, we must rely on publicly available chemical analyses and reports from third-party sources. Multiple chemical breakdowns of Crayola crayons have been published by chemists and educational organizations.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Pigment Composition in Specific Crayon Colors**\nChemical analyses, most famously illustrated in popular science graphics like \"The Chemistry of Crayola Crayons\" by Compound Interest, have identified the pigments in several crayons. These analyses reveal that Rhodamine B (C.I. Basic Violet 10) is used as a pigment in some of Crayola's fluorescent colors.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Pink/Magenta Colors:** Since Rhodamine B is a magenta dye, colors like 'Razzle Dazzle Rose' or 'Hot Magenta' are logical candidates. Analysis shows that 'Razzle Dazzle Rose' does indeed contain Rhodamine B.\n*   **Candidate 2: Screamin' Green:** Counter-intuitively, the most frequently cited and chemically interesting use of Rhodamine B in Crayola crayons is in the color **Screamin' Green**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer**\nAccording to repeated chemical analyses, the 'Screamin' Green' crayon gets its unique fluorescent color from a mixture of two dyes:\n1.  **Fluorescein** (C.I. Solvent Yellow 94), which provides a yellow-green fluorescence.\n2.  **Rhodamine B** (C.I. Basic Violet 10), the chemical specified in the question.\n\nWhile Rhodamine B is a magenta dye, its mixture with fluorescein in a wax base produces the bright, fluorescent green color known as Screamin' Green. This specific and somewhat surprising pigment combination has become a well-known piece of chemistry trivia. Therefore, the crayon that contains `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` is Screamin' Green.\n\n<<<Screamin' Green>>>"
