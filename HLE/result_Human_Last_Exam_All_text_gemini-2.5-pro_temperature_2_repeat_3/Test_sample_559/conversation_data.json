    "Analisys of the question:\nThe user wants me to find the separatrix for the given system of differential equations on the half-plane $u \\ge 0$.\nSystem:\n1. $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$\n2. $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Separatrices are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{d})$ are points where $u'(t) = 0$ and $d'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the possible values for $\\bar{u}$:\n$\\bar{u} = 0$ or $\\bar{u} = 1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the equation for $d'(t) = 0$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\bar{u} = 0$**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is $P_1 = (0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\bar{u} = 1$**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + (-3 + 5)d - 0 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n    So, we have two more equilibrium points: $P_2 = (1, 0)$ and $P_3 = (1, -1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the domain $u \\ge 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points.**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix of the system $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial u'/\\partial u & \\partial u'/\\partial d \\\\ \\partial d'/\\partial u & \\partial d'/\\partial d \\end{pmatrix}$.\nLet $F(u,d) = u^3 - u^2$ and $G(u,d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^4 + u^3$.\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} = (10u - 3)d - 4u^3 + 3u^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n\nThe Jacobian is $J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d - 4u^3 + 3u^2 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   **At $P_1 = (0, 0)$**: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive.\n*   **At $P_2 = (1, 0)$**: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(0) - 4+3 & 4(0)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Both are positive, so $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node.\n*   **At $P_3 = (1, -1)$**: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) - 4+3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7-1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -8 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Let me re-check this calculation.\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u}|_{(1,-1)} = (10(1)-3)(-1) - 4(1)^3 + 3(1)^2 = (7)(-1) - 4 + 3 = -7-1 = -8$.\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d}|_{(1,-1)} = 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = -4+5-3 = -2$.\nSo the Jacobian $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -8 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is correct. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n**Step 3: Find the separatrix.**\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $P_3 = (1, -1)$. Let's find the equation for these manifolds.\nA separatrix is an invariant manifold, meaning it's a curve made of one or more trajectories. Let's look for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$. The time derivative of such a curve is $d' = \\frac{df}{du}u'$.\nSubstituting this into the system's equations:\n$\\frac{df}{du} u' = 2f(u)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)f(u) - u^3(1-u)$.\n$\\frac{df}{du} (u^3-u^2) = 2f(u)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)f(u) + u^4 - u^3$.\n\nThis equation looks complex. Let's try to guess a simple form for the solution, for example a polynomial $f(u) = au^n$. Given the structure of the equation, $f(u) = au^2$ is a good candidate.\nLet's test the solution $d = au^2$.\nThen $d' = 2au u'$.\nSo the LHS of the first ODE becomes: $d' = 2au(u^2(u-1)) = 2au^4 - 2au^3$.\nThe RHS becomes: $2(au^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2) + u^3(u-1) = 2a^2u^4 + 5au^4 - 3au^3 + u^4-u^3 = (2a^2+5a+1)u^4 - (3a+1)u^3$.\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS for all $u$:\n$2au^4 - 2au^3 = (2a^2+5a+1)u^4 - (3a+1)u^3$.\nComparing the coefficients of the powers of $u$:\nCoefficient of $u^4$: $2a = 2a^2+5a+1 \\implies 2a^2+3a+1 = 0$.\nCoefficient of $u^3$: $-2a = -(3a+1) \\implies 2a=3a+1 \\implies a=-1$.\n\nWe must check if $a=-1$ satisfies the first equation:\n$2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 1 = 2 - 3 + 1 = 0$. It does.\nSo, $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that this manifold is a separatrix.**\nLet's check if the curve $d=-u^2$ corresponds to one of the manifolds of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n- The curve passes through the saddle point: For $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. So, yes.\n- The tangent of the curve at the saddle point must match one of the eigenvectors.\nThe slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$. This corresponds to a tangent vector $(1, -2)$.\nLet's find the eigenvectors of $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -8 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- For $\\lambda_1 = 1$ (unstable manifold): $(J - I)v = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -8 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies -8v_u-3v_d=0$. A vector is $(3, -8)$. Oh, let me re-compute the Jacobian at $(1,-1)$.\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} = (10u - 3)d - 4u^3 + 3u^2$. For $(1,-1)$: $(10-3)(-1)-4+3 = -7-1=-8$. This is correct.\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$. For $(1,-1)$: $4(-1)+5-3 = -2$. This is correct.\nEigenvector for $\\lambda=1$: $-8v_u-3v_d = 0$.\nWait, I re-checked my scratchpad calculation for the jacobian: `(-3 + 10(1))(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3` this term should have been $G(u,d) = ... - u^3+u^4$ so $\\partial G / \\partial u = (10u-3)d - 3u^2+4u^3$. At $(1,-1)$, this is $(10-3)(-1)-3(1)^2+4(1)^3 = -7-3+4=-6$.\nLet's use this correct Jacobian entry.\n$J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nEigenvectors for $J(1,-1)$:\n- For $\\lambda_1 = 1$ (unstable manifold): $(J - I)v = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies -6v_u-3v_d=0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is $v_1 = (1, -2)^T$.\n- For $\\lambda_2 = -2$ (stable manifold): $(J - (-2)I)v = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies 3v_u=0$. The eigenvector is $v_2 = (0, 1)^T$.\n\nThe slope of the curve $d=-u^2$ at $(1,-1)$ is $-2$, corresponding to the tangent vector $(1, -2)$. This matches the unstable eigenvector $v_1$.\nTherefore, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix, as it separates regions of phase space with different dynamic behaviors.\nThe stable manifold corresponds to the vertical line $u=1$.\nUsually, the non-linear manifold is what is sought.\n\nThe curve $d=-u^2$ is the separatrix.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The analysis holds together. The found curve is an exact solution of the system, passes through the saddle point, and is tangent to the unstable eigenvector at that point, which defines it as the unstable manifold (a separatrix).\n\nFinal answer is the equation of this curve.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
