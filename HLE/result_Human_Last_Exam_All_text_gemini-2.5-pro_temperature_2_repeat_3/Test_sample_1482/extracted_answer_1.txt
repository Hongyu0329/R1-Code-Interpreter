The mathematical formulation for the lower or upper bound of the FOU of a vertical cross-section in a Gaussian IT3 MF is given by:

`μ_bound(x, u) = α * exp[ - (u - μ_C(x))² / (2 * (k * σ_μ(x))²) ]`

Where:
*   `μ_bound(x, u)` is either the upper bound `overline{μ}(x, u)` or the lower bound `underline{μ}(x, u)`.
*   `x` is the primary input variable and `u` is the secondary variable (membership grade).
*   `α` is a scaling parameter (`α_U` for the upper bound, `α_L` for the lower bound).
*   `k` is a user-defined positive constant.
*   `μ_C(x) = ( overline{μ}_{L}(x) + underline{μ}_{U}(x) ) / 2` is the center of the vertical domain at `x`.
*   `σ_μ(x) = ( overline{μ}_{L}(x) - underline{μ}_{U}(x) ) / 2` is the radius of the vertical domain at `x`.
*   `overline{μ}_{L}(x)` and `underline{μ}_{U}(x)` are the primary Gaussian MFs defining the domain of the vertical slice.
