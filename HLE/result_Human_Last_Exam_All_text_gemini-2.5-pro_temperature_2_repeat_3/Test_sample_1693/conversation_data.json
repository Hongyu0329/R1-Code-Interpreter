    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Vessel Type:** Any French ship (warship or merchant ship).\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat. This includes direct attacks like torpedoes and gunfire, as well as indirect attacks like hitting a mine laid by a U-boat.\n    *   **Timeframe:** During World War II, specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This means the window of sinking is from September 1, 1939, to June 21, 1940.\n    *   **Ranking Metric:** Largest by displacement. For merchant ships, this is typically measured in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n\n2.  **Initial Search and Data Collection:**\n    The first nine months of the war, sometimes called the \"Phoney War,\" saw naval action from the beginning. We need to identify French ships sunk by U-boats in this period and record their tonnage.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Candidates:**\n    Searching through U-boat sinking records for the period of September 1939 to June 21, 1940, several French vessels were lost. We will list the largest ones to compare them.\n    *   **SS *Bretagne***: A cargo liner of 10,108 GRT, sunk by a torpedo from U-45 on October 14, 1939.\n    *   **SS *Ville de Bruges***: A passenger/cargo ship of 13,869 GRT, sunk by a torpedo from U-51 on June 14, 1940.\n    *   **SS *Champlain***: An ocean liner of 28,124 GRT, sunk on June 17, 1940.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Candidates and Address Careful Points:**\n\n    *   **SS *Bretagne* (10,108 GRT):** Sunk by direct torpedo attack from a U-boat. Fits all criteria.\n    *   **SS *Ville de Bruges* (13,869 GRT):** Also sunk by direct torpedo attack. At the time of its sinking, it was the largest French vessel lost to a U-boat. It also fits all criteria.\n    *   **SS *Champlain* (28,124 GRT):** This is the crucial candidate.\n        *   **Tonnage:** At 28,124 GRT, it is by far the largest of the candidates.\n        *   **Date:** It sank on June 17, 1940, which is five days before the armistice was signed. This fits the timeframe.\n        *   **Cause of Sinking:** This is the most important point to check. The *Champlain* struck a magnetic mine while leaving its anchorage off La Pallice, France. This mine was part of a field laid by the German submarine **U-65** on June 10-11, 1940. In naval history and kill claims, a sinking caused by a mine is credited to the vessel that laid it. Therefore, the sinking of the *Champlain* is correctly attributed to the actions of U-65.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the three largest candidates, the SS *Bretagne* (10,108 GRT), the SS *Ville de Bruges* (13,869 GRT), and the SS *Champlain* (28,124 GRT), the *Champlain* is clearly the largest. Since its sinking by a U-boat-laid mine on June 17, 1940, fits all the conditions of the question, it is the correct answer.\n\n***\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the ocean liner **SS *Champlain***.\n\n*   **Displacement:** 28,124 GRT\n*   **Date of Sinking:** June 17, 1940\n*   **Cause:** Struck a mine laid by the German submarine U-65.\n\n<<<SS Champlain>>>"
