    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the problem and the set of lines:**\n    We are looking for a convex domain `D` in the plane that has the smallest possible area, with the property that it intersects every line of the form `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p,q)=1`).\n\n2.  **Formulating the condition for intersection:**\n    A convex domain `D` intersects a line `f(x,y) = c` if and only if `D` is not entirely on one side of the line. This means that the set of values of `f(x,y)` for `(x,y)` in `D` must contain `c`. In our case, for each line `L_{p,q}` given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, the set of values of `f(x,y) = px + qy` over `D` must contain `1`.\n    This can be expressed using the minimum and maximum values of the linear function on `D`:\n    `inf_{(x,y) \\in D} (px+qy) \\le 1 \\le sup_{(x,y) \\in D} (px+qy)`\n    This condition must hold for all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`.\n\n3.  **Establishing a lower bound for the area:**\n    Let's consider a few specific lines from the given family by choosing simple coprime pairs `(p,q)`:\n    *   `p=1, q=0` (`gcd(1,0)=1`): The line is `x = 1`. The condition is `inf_D(x) \\le 1 \\le sup_D(x)`.\n    *   `p=-1, q=0` (`gcd(-1,0)=1`): The line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`. The condition is `inf_D(-x) \\le 1 \\le sup_D(-x)`. This is equivalent to `-sup_D(x) \\le 1 \\le -inf_D(x)`, which implies `inf_D(x) \\le -1` and `sup_D(x) \\ge -1`.\n    *   Combining these two conditions, we get `sup_D(x) \\ge 1` and `inf_D(x) \\le -1`. This means the domain `D` must have points with x-coordinates of at least `1` and at most `-1`. The width of `D` in the x-direction must be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   `p=0, q=1` (`gcd(0,1)=1`): The line is `y = 1`. This implies `sup_D(y) \\ge 1`.\n    *   `p=0, q=-1` (`gcd(0,-1)=1`): The line is `y = -1`. This implies `inf_D(y) \\le -1`.\n    *   Combining these, the width of `D` in the y-direction must be at least `2`.\n\n    So, any valid convex domain `D` must intersect the four lines `x=1`, `x=-1`, `y=1`, `y=-1`. This means `D` must contain the convex hull of four points, one on each of these lines. A known result in geometry (due to Reinhardt and Behrend) states that the minimum area of a convex set contained in the strip `[-1,1] \\times \\mathbb{R}` and `\\mathbb{R} \\times [-1,1]` is 2. This is achieved, for instance, by the convex hull of the four points `(1,0)`, `(-1,0)`, `(0,1)`, and `(0,-1)`. Therefore, the area of our domain `D` must be at least 2.\n\n4.  **Finding a candidate domain and verifying its validity:**\n    Let's test the domain suggested by the lower-bound analysis: the square with vertices `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, `(0,-1)`. This domain, let's call it `D_A`, can be described by the inequality `|x| + |y| \\le 1`.\n    *   `D_A` is a convex set.\n    *   The area of `D_A` is `(sqrt(2))^2 = 2`.\n    *   We must check if `D_A` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime `(p,q)`.\n    The range of values of the function `f(x,y) = px+qy` on the domain `D_A` is `[m, M]`, where `m = \\inf_{D_A}(f)` and `M = \\sup_{D_A}(f)`.\n    `D_A` is the unit ball for the L1-norm `||(x,y)||_1 = |x|+|y|`. The supremum of `px+qy` over this ball is given by the dual norm of the vector `(p,q)`, which is the L-infinity norm:\n    `M = sup_{|x|+|y| \\le 1}(px+qy) = ||(p,q)||_\\infty = \\max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    Since `D_A` is symmetric about the origin, the infimum is `m = -M = -\\max(|p|,|q|)`.\n    For `D_A` to intersect the line `px+qy=1`, the interval `[-\\max(|p|,|q|), \\max(|p|,|q|)]` must contain `1`. This is true if and only if `\\max(|p|,|q|) \\ge 1`.\n    For any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, `p` and `q` cannot both be zero. Therefore, at least one of `p` or `q` must be a non-zero integer, meaning `|p| \\ge 1` or `|q| \\ge 1`. Consequently, `\\max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1` is always true for any `(p,q)` in our set of lines.\n    This proves that the domain `D_A` intersects every line in the family.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    We have established that any convex domain `D` satisfying the given conditions must have an area of at least 2. We have also found a specific convex domain, `D_A = \\{(x,y) : |x|+|y| \\le 1\\}`, which satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2. Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
