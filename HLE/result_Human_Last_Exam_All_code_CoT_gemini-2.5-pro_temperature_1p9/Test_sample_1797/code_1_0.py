    Analyzes the statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect one.

    A. Correct. Attack graphs are directed graphs, and graph theory algorithms are used.
    B. Correct. The state explosion problem is a key challenge, leading to exponential complexity.
    C. Incorrect. The generation problem is more accurately described as having exponential time complexity (EXPTIME) due to the size of the output, not as being NP-hard. While related problems on the graph can be NP-hard, the generation task itself is one of enumeration.
    D. Correct. Systems are dynamic, so attack graphs require incremental update techniques.
    E. Correct. Attack graphs are used with model checking for formal security verification.
