    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the logical fragment**: I will first analyze the structure of the formulas allowed by $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. The schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, say $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. The formulas can use existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n2.  **Determine the Hypothesis Class**: The set of formulas with one free variable, say $x$, forms a hypothesis class (or concept class). I will show that any formula $\\phi(x)$ in this language is equivalent to either the empty concept (defined by $\\bot$) or a concept defined by a positive conjunction of atomic predicates, which has the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some subset of indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n3.  **Relate to a Known Problem**: This hypothesis class is well-known in computational learning theory. It is the class of *monotone conjunctions* over 4 boolean variables.\n4.  **Find the VC Dimension**: I will use the known result for the VC dimension of monotone conjunctions. The VC dimension of the class of monotone conjunctions over $k$ variables is exactly $k$.\n5.  **Justify the Result**:\n    *   **Lower Bound ($VC \\ge 4$)**: I will prove that the VC dimension is at least 4 by constructing a set of 4 elements that can be shattered by the hypothesis class. This involves defining a specific model (the interpretation of the predicates) and showing that for every possible labeling of the 4 elements, a corresponding formula exists.\n    *   **Upper Bound ($VC \\le 4$)**: I will prove that the VC dimension cannot be greater than 4. The number of distinct concepts defined by monotone conjunctions over 4 variables is $2^4 = 16$. To shatter a set of size $d$, one must be able to realize $2^d$ different labelings. Thus, $2^d \\le 16$, which implies $d \\le 4$.\n6.  **Final Code**: Based on this reasoning, I will provide a Python script that states the logic and prints the final answer, 4, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_vc_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the VC dimension for the given first-order logic fragment.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The schema S has 4 unary predicates.
