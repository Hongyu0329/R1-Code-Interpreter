    # The schema S has 4 unary predicates. Let's denote this number by k.
    k = 4

    # Step 1: Analyze the logical fragment and determine the hypothesis class.
    # The language is FO_{exists, land, top, bot}[S].
    # A formula phi(x) with one free variable 'x' defines a concept.
    # Any such formula can be shown to be equivalent to either bot (the false predicate,
    # defining the empty set) or a formula of the form:
    # P_{i_1}(x) AND P_{i_2}(x) AND ... AND P_{i_m}(x)
    # This is a conjunction of positive literals, also known as a monotone monomial.
    # The set of concepts is therefore the class of monotone conjunctions over k boolean variables.

    # Step 2: State the VC dimension for this class.
    # The VC dimension of the class of monotone conjunctions over k variables is a known result in
    # computational learning theory, and it is equal to k.
    
    vc_dimension = k

    # Step 3: Justification
    # Lower bound (VC-dim >= k):
    # We can construct a set of k points that is shattered.
    # Let the universe be S = {s_1, ..., s_k}.
    # Define a model M where P_j(s_i) is true if and only if j != i.
    # For any subset T of S, the formula consisting of the conjunction of all P_j
    # where s_j is NOT in T will correctly classify S.
    
    # Upper bound (VC-dim <= k):
    # The number of distinct monotone conjunctions over k variables is 2**k.
    # Let this be N_concepts.
    num_concepts = 2**k
    # To shatter a set of size d, we need to generate 2**d distinct classifications.
    # This number cannot exceed the total number of available concepts.
    # So, 2**d <= N_concepts, which means 2**d <= 2**k. This implies d <= k.

    # Conclusion: Since VC-dim >= k and VC-dim <= k, the VC dimension must be k.
