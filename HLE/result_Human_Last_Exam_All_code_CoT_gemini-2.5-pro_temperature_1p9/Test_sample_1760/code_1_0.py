def solve():
    """
    This function prints the letters corresponding to the true statements, sorted in lexicographic order.

    The analysis is based on the following interpretations:
    - L: Standard Levenshtein distance (a metric).
    - LT: Optimal String Alignment (OSA) distance (allows adjacent swaps, not a metric).
    - RL: Shift-Edit distance (L plus a unit-cost full string rotation operation, not a metric).

    True statements based on analysis:
    A: L is a metric, so it satisfies the triangle inequality.
    C: All operations are symmetric/invertible with the same cost.
    D: A key property of OSA is that it violates the triangle inequality.
    E: RL allows more operations than L, so the min cost must be <= L's cost.
    F: The pair x=(ab)^k, y=(ba)^k shows a linear difference between L and LT.
    G: Shift-edit distance is known to violate the triangle inequality.
    H: Edit distance computation is conditionally proven to have a near-quadratic lower bound.
