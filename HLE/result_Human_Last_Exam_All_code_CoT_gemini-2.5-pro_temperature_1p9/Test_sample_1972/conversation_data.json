    "My plan is to first identify the key elements in your query: the quote (\"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"), the description of the author (\"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\"), and the source of the quote (Jorge Luis Borges). I will use this information to determine the novel and author Borges was referring to. Then, I will write a simple Python script that stores this information in variables and prints the complete answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the novel and author\n    Jorge Luis Borges was referring to based on the user's query.\n    \"\"\"\n    novel_title = \"El astillero\"\n    english_title = \"The Shipyard\"\n    author_name = \"Juan Carlos Onetti\"\n    quoter_name = \"Jorge Luis Borges\"\n    quote_fragment_1 = \"the intensity of a tiger\"\n    quote_fragment_2 = \"the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"\n    author_description = \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\"\n\n    print(f\"{quoter_name} was referring to the novel:\")\n    print(f'\"{novel_title}\" (in English, \"{english_title}\")')\n    print(\"\\nWritten by the author:\")\n    print(f\"{author_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nBorges described the novel as having...\")\n    print(f'\"{quote_fragment_1} and {quote_fragment_2},\"')\n    print(\"\\n...and described its author as...\")\n    print(f'\"{author_description}.\"')\n\nfind_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<El astillero>>>"
