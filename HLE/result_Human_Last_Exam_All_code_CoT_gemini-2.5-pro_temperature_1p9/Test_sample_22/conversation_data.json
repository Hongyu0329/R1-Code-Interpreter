    "Of course. Here is my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer and the demonstrative code.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Statement:** The core statement is: \"The predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured by variance explained, is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\"\n\n2.  **Define the Key Terms:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This represents the *theoretical maximum* proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by a perfect linear combination of all considered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It's an estimate of the total additive genetic variance captured by the SNPs on a genotyping chip. It assumes you know the \"true\" effect size of every single SNP and can combine them perfectly.\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a *practical tool*, not a theoretical limit. It's a score calculated for an individual by summing up the effects of many SNPs. The effect sizes used in this calculation are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n    *   **Predictive Ability (R²):** This measures how well the PGS *actually* predicts the phenotype in a new, independent dataset. It's the square of the correlation between the PGS and the phenotype, representing the proportion of variance explained by the score.\n\n3.  **Compare the Concepts:**\n    *   SNP heritability is the *ceiling* or the *upper bound*. It's what's theoretically possible.\n    *   A PGS is a *real-world model* trying to reach that ceiling.\n    *   Why can't the PGS reach the ceiling?\n        *   **Estimation Error:** The SNP effect sizes from the GWAS are *estimates*, not the true values. They have statistical noise and uncertainty due to finite sample sizes.\n        *   **Incomplete Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The SNPs in a PGS may not be the causal variants themselves but are merely correlated with them. The GWAS might not perfectly capture the LD structure to tag all causal variants.\n        *   **Winner's Curse:** SNPs chosen for the PGS often have overestimated effect sizes in the discovery GWAS sample. When applied to a new sample, their effect is typically smaller, reducing predictive power.\n        *   **Different Ancestries:** If the PGS is applied to a population with a different genetic ancestry than the GWAS discovery sample, its predictive power will decrease due to differences in LD patterns, allele frequencies, and gene-environment interactions.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because a PGS is built on imperfect estimates and faces other real-world limitations, its actual predictive power (R²) will inevitably be lower than the theoretical maximum possible predictive power (SNP heritability).\n\n5.  **Formulate the Answer:** The statement is correct. The answer is \"True\".\n\n6.  **Develop a Code Demonstration:** The prompt requires a code block. I cannot use real genetic data, but I can create a simulation to demonstrate the principle.\n\n    *   **Goal:** Show that `PGS R² < SNP Heritability`.\n    *   **Plan:**\n        1.  Import `numpy`.\n        2.  Simulate a population: Define the number of individuals and SNPs.\n        3.  Simulate genotypes (`X`). Let's use 0, 1, or 2 to represent the number of alternate alleles.\n        4.  Define a \"true\" genetic architecture. Select a small fraction of SNPs to be the \"causal\" variants and assign them true effect sizes (`beta_true`).\n        5.  Calculate the \"true\" genetic component of the phenotype (`G`) for each person by multiplying their genotypes by the true effect sizes. `G = X @ beta_true`.\n        6.  Define the target SNP heritability (`h2_snp`).\n        7.  Calculate the variance of the true genetic component (`var_g`).\n        8.  Based on the definition `h2_snp = var_g / var_phenotype`, we can calculate the required environmental variance: `var_e = var_g * (1 - h2_snp) / h2_snp`.\n        9.  Simulate the environmental noise (`E`) with this variance.\n        10. Create the final phenotype: `P = G + E`. By design, the variance explained by all SNPs in our model is now `h2_snp`.\n        11. Now, simulate the \"imperfect\" GWAS process. We won't run a real GWAS, but we'll simulate its result: *imperfectly estimated effect sizes*. We can do this by adding some random noise to our `beta_true` to get `beta_estimated`. This mimics the estimation error in a real GWAS.\n        12. Build the Polygenic Score (PGS) using these *estimated* betas: `PGS = X @ beta_estimated`.\n        13. Calculate the predictive ability (R²) of this PGS by finding the squared correlation between the final phenotype (`P`) and the calculated `PGS`.\n        14. Print both the defined SNP heritability and the calculated PGS R². The code will demonstrate that R² is lower than the heritability.\n        15. Add clear print statements explaining what is being shown.\n\nThis simulation directly illustrates the concept in the question.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_pgs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    This simulation demonstrates that the predictive ability of a Polygenic Score (R^2)\n    is lower than the theoretical SNP heritability (h^2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
