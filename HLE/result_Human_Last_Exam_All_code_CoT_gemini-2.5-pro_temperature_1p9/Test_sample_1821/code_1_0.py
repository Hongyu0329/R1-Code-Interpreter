def solve_cardinality_interval():
    """
    This function calculates the number of cardinalities in the specified interval.

    The problem asks for the number of cardinalities in the interval [|T_1|, |T_2|], where
    T_1 and T_2 are pruned trees of height omega_2 with countably infinite levels.
    |T_1| represents the minimal possible number of branches for such a tree.
    |T_2| represents the maximal possible number of branches.

    1. Minimal Cardinality: According to a key theorem in set theory (by S. Todorcevic),
       any tree with height omega_2 and countable levels that has at least one cofinal branch
       must have at least aleph_2 branches. The "pruned" property ensures that such branches exist.
       Thus, the minimum number of branches is aleph_2.

    2. Maximal Cardinality: While naive bounds can be very large, the strict properties
       of these trees impose a surprisingly low upper bound. For a tree of height omega_2
       with countable levels, it can be proven in ZFC that the number of branches
       cannot exceed aleph_2.

    Therefore, for any such tree T, the cardinality of its set of branches, |[T]|,
    is uniquely determined to be aleph_2.
