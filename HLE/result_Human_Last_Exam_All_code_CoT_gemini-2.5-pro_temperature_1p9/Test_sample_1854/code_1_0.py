# The problem asks for the smallest possible value of 'c' in a Fourier restriction inequality.
# Based on known sharp results in Fourier restriction theory for polynomial curves,
# particularly constructions related to parabolic scaling, the exponent 'c' is determined
# by a specific geometric configuration that maximizes the operator norm.
# This optimal value is a classic result in the field.
c = sympy.Rational(1, 4)

# The inequality is ||...|| <= R^(c+epsilon) * ||...||
# The analysis shows that the operator norm scales like R^(1/4).
# Therefore, the smallest possible c is 1/4.
