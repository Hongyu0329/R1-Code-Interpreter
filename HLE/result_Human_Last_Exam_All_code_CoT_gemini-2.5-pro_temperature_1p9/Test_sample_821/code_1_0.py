    This function demonstrates the logical derivation for the largest possible value of d.

    Let the property that "the points a_1, ..., a_n divide [0,d] into
    segments of length at most 1/n" be P(n).

    From P(n-1), we know the segments are of length at most 1/(n-1).
    From P(n), we know the segments are of length at most 1/n.

    Consider the segments at step n-1. When we add the point a_n, it falls
    into one of these segments. All other segments must already satisfy the P(n)
    condition, meaning their length must be at most 1/n.

    So at step n-1, at most one segment can have a length greater than 1/n.
    Let there be 'm' segments at step n-1 (m <= n).
    The total length d is the sum of these segment lengths.
    d <= (length of the one longest segment) + (sum of lengths of other m-1 segments)
    d <= 1/(n-1) + (m-1) * (1/n)

    Since m <= n, the tightest constraint comes from the maximum possible value m=n:
    d <= 1/(n-1) + (n-1)/n = 1 + 1/(n*(n-1))

    This inequality must hold for all n >= 2. Let's see how this bound behaves
    for increasing n.
