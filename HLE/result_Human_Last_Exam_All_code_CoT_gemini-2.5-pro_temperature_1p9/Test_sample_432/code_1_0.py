def solve_cardinality_question():

    This function identifies and prints the labels of the sets that have the
    same cardinality as the interval [0, 1].

    The cardinality of [0, 1] is the cardinality of the continuum, c.
    The analysis of each option is as follows:
    A. (0, 1): Cardinality c. Correct.
    B. N: Cardinality Aleph_0. Incorrect.
    C. Q: Cardinality Aleph_0. Incorrect.
    D. R: Cardinality c. Correct.
    E. R \ Q: Cardinality c. Correct.
    F. C (Complex numbers, R^2): Cardinality c^2 = c. Correct.
    G. H (Quaternions, R^4): Cardinality c^4 = c. Correct.
    H. {x: c'(x) = 0}: This set contains open intervals, so its cardinality is c. Correct.
    I. Set of strings: Countable, Cardinality Aleph_0. Incorrect.
    J. R^N: Cardinality c^(Aleph_0) = c. Correct.
    K. Z^N: Cardinality Aleph_0^(Aleph_0) = c. Correct.
    L. N x N: Cardinality Aleph_0. Incorrect.
    M. R x R: Cardinality c^2 = c. Correct.
    N. 2^N: Cardinality 2^(Aleph_0) = c. Correct.
    O. 2^Q: Cardinality 2^(Aleph_0) = c. Correct.
    P. 2^C: Cardinality 2^c. Incorrect.
    Q. 2^(2^Z): Cardinality 2^c. Incorrect.
