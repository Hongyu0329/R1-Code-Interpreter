Step 1: Understand the definitions.
- A continuum is a compact, connected metric space. The n-cube, [0,1]^n, is a prime example.
- A space S is continuum-connected if any two points in S can be joined by a continuum lying entirely within S.
- A point p in a continuum X is a non-block point if X \\ {p} contains a dense subset that is continuum-connected.
The question is for how many positive integers n, does [0,1]^n FAIL to be the set of non-block points for ANY continuum X.

Step 2: Analyze the case for n >= 2.
Let's consider the n-cube itself as the continuum, i.e., X = [0,1]^n. We want to find its set of non-block points, N(X).
For any point p in [0,1]^n where n >= 2, the space X \\ {p} is path-connected.
If a space is path-connected, it is also continuum-connected. (The path itself provides the required continuum).
The set X \\ {p} is dense in itself.
So, for any p in [0,1]^n (with n >= 2), X \\ {p} is a dense, continuum-connected subset of itself.
This means every point p is a non-block point.
Therefore, N([0,1]^n) = [0,1]^n for all n >= 2.
This shows that for n = 2, 3, 4, ..., the n-cube DOES occur as the set of non-block points of a continuum (namely, itself). So these values of n are not the ones we are looking for.

Step 3: Analyze the case for n = 1.
Let's first consider the continuum X = [0,1].
- Take any point p in the interior, p in (0,1). The set X \\ {p} is [0, p) U (p, 1]. This set is disconnected.
- Let D be any dense subset of X \\ {p}. Since D is dense, it must contain points from both [0,p) and (p,1].
- For D to be continuum-connected, there must be a continuum K within D connecting these points.
- However, any continuum K is connected. A connected subset of a disconnected space must lie entirely within one of the connected components.
- So, no continuum can connect points from [0,p) and (p,1]. This means D cannot be continuum-connected.
- Therefore, any point p in (0,1) is a block point, not a non-block point.
- Now consider the endpoints, p = 0 or p = 1. For p=0, X \\ {0} = (0,1]. This is path-connected and thus continuum-connected. So 0 is a non-block point. Similarly, 1 is a non-block point.
- So, the set of non-block points of [0,1] is {0, 1}, which is not equal to [0,1].

Step 4: Argue that for n=1, no other continuum can work.
Could there be some other continuum Y such that N(Y) = [0,1]?
- Assume such a continuum Y exists. This means [0,1] is a subset of Y.
- Every point p in (0,1) must be a non-block point of Y. In Step 3, we saw that p is a cut point of [0,1]. For p to be a non-block point of Y, Y cannot be 'cut' by p.
- This requires some path or continuum in Y that bypasses p, connecting a point in [0,p) to a point in (p,1] without going through p.
- Let this bypassing continuum be K. K must contain points outside of [0,1], because no such bypass exists within [0,1].
- Let q be a point on this continuum K that is not in [0,1]. By our assumption, N(Y)=[0,1], so q must be a block point of Y.
- However, a point q lying on such a bypassing arc that joins two parts of a space is generally a non-block point itself (removing it is unlikely to destroy all continuum-connections in a dense subset).
- This leads to a contradiction: the very structure required to make all points in [0,1] non-block points seems to create new non-block points outside of [0,1].
- Therefore, no such continuum Y can exist. [0,1] fails to be the set of non-block points for any continuum.

Step 5: Conclude and state the final answer.
- For n >= 2, [0,1]^n can be a set of non-block points.
- For n = 1, [0,1]^1 fails to be a set of non-block points for any continuum.
- The question asks for how many values of n this failure occurs. This only occurs for n = 1.
- So, there is exactly one such value of n.
