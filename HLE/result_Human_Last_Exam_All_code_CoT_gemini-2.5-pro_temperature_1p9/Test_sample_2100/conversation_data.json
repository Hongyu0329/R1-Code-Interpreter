    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I will break down the riddle into key pieces of information:\n    *   The subject is a man described by poet Andrei Voznesensky as a \"joy-discovering sailor.\"\n    *   Voznesensky wrote a famous poem questioning the location of this man's grave.\n    *   The grave's location was discovered in the late 1980s.\n2.  **Identify the Figure:** These clues point directly to Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer. Voznesensky's famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" is based on Rezanov's story and includes the line about his lost grave. Rezanov died in 1807, and his grave in Krasnoyarsk was lost for over a century before being rediscovered by Soviet archaeologists in the late 1980s.\n3.  **Construct the Code:** As requested, I will write a Python script. To satisfy the requirement of an \"equation,\" I will create a simple narrative statement that includes the year of his death and the approximate year of the grave's rediscovery, framing them as solving the historical mystery. The code will then print the final last name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle about the man whose grave was lost and found.\n    It uses key dates from his story to form a narrative \"equation.\"\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The man, Nikolai Rezanov, died in 1807.\n    year_of_death = 1807\n\n    # His grave was rediscovered in the late 1980s. We'll use 1989 as a representative year.\n    year_grave_found = 1989\n    \n    # The last name of the man in question.\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\n    # Fulfilling the \"equation\" requirement by presenting the historical facts with their numbers.\n    print(\"Solving the historical equation:\")\n    print(f\"The year of death ({year_of_death}) + The long period of mystery = The rediscovery around {year_grave_found}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis points to the man whose grave was lost in Krasnoyarsk.\")\n    print(f\"His last name is: {last_name}\")\n\nsolve_historical_riddle()\n<<<Rezanov>>>\n```"
