    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial**: The given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. The first step is to find its irreducible factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Identify Galois Groups of Factors**: For each irreducible factor, we determine the Galois group of its splitting field over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  **Determine the Full Galois Group**: The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors. We determine the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ by analyzing the relationship between the individual splitting fields.\n4.  **Apply Galois Theory**: The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory establishes a correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ (where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset L \\subset K$) and subgroups of $G$. Furthermore, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ correspond to normal subgroups $N$ of $G$. The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is equal to the index of the corresponding normal subgroup, $[G:N] = |G|/|N|$.\n5.  **Find Normal Subgroups**: We need to find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups $N$ of the group $G$. \"Proper, non-trivial\" means that $N$ is not the trivial group $\\{e\\}$ and not the whole group $G$. This ensures that the corresponding field $L$ is strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n6.  **Calculate Degrees**: For each proper, non-trivial normal subgroup $N$ found, we calculate the index $[G:N]$ to find a possible degree for a normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis plan will be executed by the following Python script.
