    Calculates the number of smooth coverings based on group theory principles.

    The number of smooth coverings of D(PSL(2, p), b, w) by D(SL(2, p), b, w)
    is equal to the order of the center of the covering group, |Z(SL(2, p))|.

    The center consists of scalar matrices λI with determinant 1.
    For a 2x2 matrix, det(λI) = λ^2.
    So, we solve λ^2 = 1 in the field F_p.
    Given p > 5 (an odd prime), the solutions are λ = 1 and λ = -1, which are distinct.
    Thus, there are 2 elements in the center.
