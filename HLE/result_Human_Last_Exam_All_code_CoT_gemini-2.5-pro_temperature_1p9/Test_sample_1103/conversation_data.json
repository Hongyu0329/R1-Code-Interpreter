    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to know the number of negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48. This is a well-known problem in computational number theory.\n2.  **Method:** Calculating class numbers from scratch is computationally very intensive. The results for class numbers up to 100 have been determined through large-scale computer searches by mathematicians, most notably Mark Watkins. The definitive results are published and cataloged in resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n3.  **Execution:** Instead of performing a massive computation, the most practical and reliable approach is to use these established results. I will write a Python script that contains a dictionary of the known frequencies of class numbers (up to 50 for brevity). The script will then look up the frequency for class number 48.\n4.  **Code Details:** The script will define the target class number, look up the corresponding count in the pre-populated dictionary, and print the result in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\nThis method provides an accurate answer based on authoritative mathematical research, presented in a simple, executable script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_class_number_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number\n    by looking up the value from a table of pre-computed results.\n\n    The data is sourced from extensive computations by mathematicians, primarily from\n    M. Watkins' tables on class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields, which are\n    considered the authoritative source.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping the class number (h) to the number of negative\n    # fundamental discriminants with that class number.
