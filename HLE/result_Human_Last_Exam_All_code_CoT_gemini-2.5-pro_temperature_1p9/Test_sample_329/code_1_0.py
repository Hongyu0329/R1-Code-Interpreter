def solve():
    """
    This function analyzes the given matrices and determines which ones are in the specified convex hull P.
    
    The set P is the convex hull of matrices v * v^T, where v is a non-zero 2D integer vector.
    Let v = [x, y], then v * v^T is the matrix:
    [[x^2, xy],
     [xy, y^2]]

    Properties of matrices in P:
    1. Symmetric: All generating matrices are symmetric, so any matrix in P is symmetric.
    2. Positive Semidefinite (PSD): All generating matrices are PSD, so any matrix in P is PSD.
       For a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, c]], PSD means a >= 0, c >= 0, and ac - b^2 >= 0.
    3. Trace >= 1: The trace of a generating matrix is x^2 + y^2, which is a positive integer.
       The smallest is 1 (for v=(1,0) or (0,1)). A convex combination of numbers >= 1 is also >= 1.
