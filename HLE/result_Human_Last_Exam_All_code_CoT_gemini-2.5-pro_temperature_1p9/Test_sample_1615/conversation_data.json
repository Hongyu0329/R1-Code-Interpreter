    "To find the maximum number of colours needed to properly colour the vertices of a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph, we need to determine the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, under these conditions.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of colours required to colour its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.\n\n2.  **General Upper Bound:** For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n\n3.  **Condition for the Maximum Chromatic Number:** The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if every vertex needs a unique colour. This happens only when every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, which is the definition of a complete graph, denoted as $K_n$.\n\n4.  **Applying the Problem's Constraint:** The problem specifies that the graph $G$ is **not** a complete graph. Therefore, we know that for our graph $G$, $\\chi(G) \\neq n$. This implies that its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. So, we have the inequality $\\chi(G) \\le n - 1$.\n\n5.  **Achieving the New Upper Bound:** Now we need to check if this new upper bound of $n-1$ is achievable for a graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete. We can show this by constructing such a graph. Consider a graph $G^*$ created by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and adding one more vertex that is isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n    *   This graph $G^*$ has $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other $n-1$ vertices.\n    *   To colour $G^*$, the $K_{n-1}$ subgraph requires $n-1$ distinct colours. The isolated vertex can be coloured with any of these existing colours. Thus, the chromatic number of $G^*$ is $\\chi(G^*) = n-1$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices must have a chromatic number of at most $n-1$, and we have constructed a graph that achieves this value, the maximum number of colours needed is $n-1$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** With $n=12345$ vertices, the maximum number of colours is $12345 - 1 = 12344$. The information about the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ is related by Brook's theorem, which states that for most graphs $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$, but it is not needed for this specific problem as we can choose a graph that maximizes the chromatic number.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors for a non-complete graph with n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n    \n    # The chromatic number of a graph with n vertices is at most n.\n    # Equality holds if and only if the graph is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # Since the graph G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than n.\n    # So, the maximum possible chromatic number is n - 1.\n    # This can be achieved by a graph consisting of a K_{n-1} clique and one isolated vertex.\n    max_colors = n - 1\n    \n    print(f\"Let n be the number of vertices in the graph, where n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The graph is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of such a graph is n - 1.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
