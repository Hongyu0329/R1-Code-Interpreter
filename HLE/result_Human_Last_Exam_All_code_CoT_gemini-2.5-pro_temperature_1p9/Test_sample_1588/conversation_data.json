    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The number of new, linearly independent commutators of a given order `n` corresponds to the dimension of the `n`-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators (X and Y). This dimension is given by Witt's formula.\n\nThe formula is:\n`l(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} (mu(n/d) * k^d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order, which is 10.\n*   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (for X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `mu` is the a_Möbius function.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that implements this formula for `n=10` and `k=2`. The script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Find all divisors of 10.\n2.  For each divisor `d`, it will calculate the corresponding term `mu(10/d) * 2^d`. This requires implementing the Möbius function.\n3.  It will then sum these terms.\n4.  Finally, it will divide the sum by 10 to get the result.\n5.  The script will print out each step of the calculation, including the values of the terms being summed, to show how the final answer is reached.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\n    Example: get_prime_factorization(12) returns {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    mu(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of a given order.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order of the expansion\n    k = 2   # Number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order {n}.\")\n    print(\"This is given by Witt's formula: l(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n}(mu(n/d) * k^d)\")\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"\\nThe divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divisors}\")\n\n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_terms = []\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating the terms mu(n/d) * k^d for each divisor d:\")\n    for d in divisors:\n        n_over_d = n // d\n        mu_val = mobius(n_over_d)\n        term_val = mu_val * (k**d)\n        total_sum += term_val\n        sum_terms.append(str(term_val))\n        print(f\"  d={d:2}: mu({n}/{d})*k^d = mu({n_over_d})*{k}^{d} = {mu_val:2} * {k**d:<4} = {term_val}\")\n    \n    # Ensure integer division\n    result = total_sum // n\n\n    sum_str = \" + \".join(sum_terms).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n\n    print(\"\\nPutting the terms together into the final equation:\")\n    print(f\"l({n}) = (1/{n}) * ({sum_str})\")\n    print(f\"l({n}) = (1/{n}) * ({total_sum})\")\n    print(f\"l({n}) = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
