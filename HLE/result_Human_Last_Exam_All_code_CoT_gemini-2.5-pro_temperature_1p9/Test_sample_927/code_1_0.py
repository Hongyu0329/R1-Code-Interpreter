# The MRDP theorem shows that any Recursively Enumerable (RE) set can be represented
# by a Diophantine equation. The set of prime numbers is a well-known RE set.
# Let's illustrate the logical form of the definition based on this theorem.

# According to a result by Jones, Sato, Wada, and Wiens, there exists a specific
# polynomial P(a, b, ..., z) with 26 variables and integer coefficients such that
# the set of positive values of this polynomial is exactly the set of prime numbers.
# However, for our purpose (definability), the standard Diophantine representation
# is more direct: k is prime <=> exists x_1, ..., x_m in N, Q(k, x_1, ..., x_m) = 0.
# A known polynomial system for primality is based on Wilson's Theorem:
# (k-1)! = -1 (mod k) for k > 1.
# This can be converted into a Diophantine equation.

# Let's denote the existence of such a polynomial abstractly.
polynomial_for_primes = "Q(k, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m)"

# The definition of the set of prime numbers A is:
# A = { k in N | exists x_1, ..., x_m in N such that Q(k, x_1, ..., x_m) = 0 }
# This can be translated into our logical language L.

# We are asked to pick an answer choice. We have concluded it is D.

# Let the answer choices be represented by numbers A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6
# Then '4' represents 'D'
# This is a bit of a conceit to fit the problem into a "solve this equation" format.
