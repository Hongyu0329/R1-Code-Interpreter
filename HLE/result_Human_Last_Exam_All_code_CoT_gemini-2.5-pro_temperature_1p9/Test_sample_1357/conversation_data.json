    "This problem can be solved by applying a fundamental theorem from the theory of algebraic curves concerning the relationship between the reduction of a curve and its Jacobian variety.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Identify the given information: we are considering a curve `C` of genus `g = 4`, and its Jacobian `J(C)` is assumed to have good reduction.\n2.  Recall the key theorem by Deligne and Mumford (refining earlier work by Igusa): For a curve `C` of genus `g > 1` defined over a valuation field, its Jacobian `J(C)` has good reduction if and only if the curve `C` itself has good reduction.\n3.  \"Good reduction\" for a curve means that its minimal stable model has a special fiber that is a smooth curve (of the same genus). A smooth curve is a specific kind of stable curveâ€”one with no nodal singularities.\n4.  Apply the theorem to our case. Since the genus `g = 4` is greater than 1, the theorem applies.\n5.  The condition that `J(C)` has good reduction forces the stable reduction of `C` to be a smooth curve of genus 4.\n6.  This means there is only one possible \"type\" of stable reduction: the smooth type. All other potential types (e.g., irreducible curves with nodes, or reducible curves made of components) are ruled out by the good reduction condition on the Jacobian.\n7.  The code will formalize this reasoning and print the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stable_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve\n    whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The genus of the curve in question.\n    genus = 4\n\n    print(\"Problem: How many types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves exist if the Jacobian has good reduction?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The genus of the curve is g = {genus}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: State the relevant mathematical theorem.\")\n    print(\"A theorem by Deligne and Mumford states that for a curve of genus g > 1,\")\n    print(\"its Jacobian has good reduction if and only if the curve itself has good reduction.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Apply the theorem to this case.\")\n    print(f\"Since our genus g = {genus} is greater than 1, the theorem applies.\")\n    print(\"The given condition is that the Jacobian has good reduction.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the curve itself must have good reduction.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Interpret the result.\")\n    print(\"Good reduction for a curve means its stable reduction is a smooth curve.\")\n    print(\"A smooth curve represents a single 'type' of stable reduction (the one with no nodes or reducible components).\")\n\n    # The final calculation is based on this conclusion.\n    # There is only one type possible: the smooth one.\n    number_of_types = 1\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"The number of possible types of stable reductions is therefore determined.\")\n    print(f\"Number of types = {number_of_types}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_stable_reductions()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
