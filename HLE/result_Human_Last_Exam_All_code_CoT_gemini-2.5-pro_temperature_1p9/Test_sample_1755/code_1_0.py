    # Plan:
    # 1. Identify the primary error in the C code.
    #    The scanf function uses a "%d" format specifier (from &ss), which expects
    #    a pointer to an integer (int *), but it is given a pointer to a character (&c).
    #    This is undefined behavior and can lead to a buffer overflow.
    # 2. Determine the line number of the error.
    #    The variable `c` causing the issue is declared on line 5.
    # 3. Determine the fix and the number of edits.
    #    The fix is to change the type of `c` from `char` to `int`.
    #    `char c;` -> `int c;`
    #    This counts as a single conceptual edit operation on the line.
    #    Let's define the number of edits (n) as 1 for this type change.
    # 4. Print the final answer.
