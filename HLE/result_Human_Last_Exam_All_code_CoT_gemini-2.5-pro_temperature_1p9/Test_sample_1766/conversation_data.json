    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\nFirst, I will identify the quantum numbers for the system. A p-electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number `l = 1` and a spin quantum number `s = 1/2`.\n\nNext, I'll apply the rules for the addition of angular momentum to find the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, `j`. The values of `j` are given by `j = |l - s|, |l - s| + 1, ..., l + s`.\n\nFor each determined value of `j`, I will find the common eigenvalues for the operators $J^2$ and $J_z$:\n1.  The eigenvalue of $J^2$ for a state with quantum number `j` is `j(j+1)ħ²`.\n2.  The eigenvalues of $J_z$ for a state with quantum number `j` are `m_j ħ`, where the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can be any value from `-j` to `j` in steps of 1.\n\nThe Python script will implement these steps. It will use the `fractions` module to represent the quantum numbers accurately. The code will loop through each possible `j` value, calculate the corresponding eigenvalues for both $J^2$ and $J_z$, and print the results in the form of the eigenvalue equations, showing all the numbers involved in the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    A p-electron has orbital angular momentum l=1 and spin s=1/2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    l = 1\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)\n\n    # Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron with l={l} and s={s}:\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate through each possible j value\n    for j_val in j_values:\n        j = Fraction(j_val)\n        print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n        print(f\"For the state with total angular momentum j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Calculate and print the eigenvalue of J^2\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ² = {j}*({j}+1)ħ² = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ²\")\n        \n        # Determine the possible mj values\n        mj_values = [Fraction(m) for m in np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)]\n        \n        # Print the corresponding eigenvalues of Jz\n        print(f\"  The {2*j+1} possible eigenvalues of J_z are m_j*ħ:\")\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            print(f\"    For m_j = {mj}, the eigenvalue is {mj}ħ\")\n\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n\n# The total number of states is (2l+1)*(2s+1) = (2*1+1)*(2*1/2+1) = 3 * 2 = 6.\n# This corresponds to the states for j=3/2 (2*(3/2)+1 = 4 states) and j=1/2 (2*(1/2)+1 = 2 states). 4 + 2 = 6.\ntotal_states = (2 * l + 1) * (2 * s.numerator / s.denominator + 1)\n\n# As the problem does not have a single numerical answer, \n# we provide the total number of eigenstates as the final answer.\nfinal_answer = int((2 * 1 + 1) * (2 * 0.5 + 1))\nprint(f\"\\nTotal number of states: {final_answer}\")\n<<<6>>>\n```"
