    "For the given integral, $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$, we want to find an approximation for small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Contribution:** When $\\epsilon$ is very small, the value of the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$ becomes very large where the denominator is smallest. The denominator is $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. Let $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. For $x \\ge 0$, $f(x)$ has a single minimum at $x=0$, where $f(0)=0$. Thus, the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the Integrand:** For small $x$, the function $f(x)$ can be approximated by its lowest power term: $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$. This approximation is valid because higher-order terms ($x^6$, $x^8$) become negligible compared to $x^5$ as $x \\to 0$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Integral:** Using this approximation, the integral becomes:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n    Since the integrand becomes very small for large $x$, the contribution from $x$ near 15.00 is negligible compared to the contribution from $x$ near 0. We can, therefore, extend the upper limit of integration to infinity without introducing significant error to the leading-order approximation.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n4.  **Solve the Integral Analytically:** This simplified integral can be solved using a change of variables. Let $x = u \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5.0}$.\n    Then $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5.0} du$.\n    Substituting these into the integral gives:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0} du}{\\epsilon + 9.0 \\left(u (\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0}\\right)^{5.0}} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0} du}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^{5.0}}$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{(\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^{5.0}} du$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9.0^{-1/5.0} \\epsilon^{-4/5.0} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^{5.0}} du$\n\n5.  **Use a Standard Integral Result:** The definite integral has a known solution related to the Gamma function: $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^p} du = \\frac{\\pi/p}{\\sin(\\pi/p)}$. For $p=5.0$, this value is $\\frac{\\pi/5.0}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Final Approximation:** Combining these results, we get the analytical formula:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9.0^{-1/5.0} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5.0}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\right) \\epsilon^{-4/5.0}$\n    This can be written as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx K \\cdot \\epsilon^n$, where the exponent is $n = -4/5.0 = -0.8$, and the coefficient is $K = \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot 9.0^{1/5.0} \\cdot \\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical values for the coefficient $K$ and the exponent $n$ and prints the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function develops and prints an analytical approximation for the integral\n    I(epsilon) for the small epsilon regime.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The integral is dominated by the behavior near x=0.\n    # The denominator is approximated by epsilon + c * x^p, where from the problem:\n    c = 9.0\n    p = 5.0\n\n    # The approximate formula is I(epsilon) ~ K * epsilon^n.\n    # The exponent n is given by 1/p - 1.\n    n = 1.0/p - 1.0\n\n    # The coefficient K is given by c**(-1/p) * integral_0^inf(1/(1+u**p))du\n    # The integral evaluates to (pi/p)/sin(pi/p).\n    K = (c**(-1.0/p)) * (np.pi/p) / np.sin(np.pi/p)\n\n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) \\u2248 K * \\u03B5^n\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The constants K and n are derived from the leading term of the polynomial in the denominator (9.0 * x^5.0).\")\n    \n    # We output each number in the final equation by first stating what they represent.\n    print(f\"The coefficient from the dominant term is c = {c}\")\n    print(f\"The power from the dominant term is p = {p}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"This leads to the following values for K and n:\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient K = (1 / ({c}^(1/{p}) * {p} * sin(\\u03C0/{p}))) * \\u03C0 \\u2248 {K:.10f}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent n = 1/{p} - 1 = {n}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The final approximate equation is:\")\n    print(f\"I(\\u03B5) \\u2248 {K:.10f} * \\u03B5^({n})\")\n\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<I(epsilon) = 0.6888007204 * epsilon**(-0.8)>>>"
