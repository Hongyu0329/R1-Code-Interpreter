    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. Let $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ for $i=0, 1, 2, 3$. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their time derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are all zero.\n\nBefore we proceed, it's important to note a likely typo in the provided system of equations. For the total probability $\\sum P_i(t)$ to be conserved and equal to 1 for all time, the sum of their derivatives must be zero. Adding the given equations, we get $(\\sum P_i(t))' = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$, which is non-zero and would mean the total probability is not conserved. The standard form for such physical systems, known as Kolmogorov-Chapman or master equations, requires that the inflow and outflow of probability for each state balance out across the whole system. The second equation for $P_1'(t)$ most likely has a sign error. It should be:\n$P_{1}'(t) = \\mathbf{+ \\lambda_{01}}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nUsing this corrected equation, we can set up the system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_i$:\n\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$ (Normalization condition)\n\nWe can now solve this system using the given values for $\\lambda_{ij}$. The Python code below will perform this calculation and show the steps involved.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script calculates the steady-state probability sum P0 + P1.\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Use the steady-state conditions (P_i' = 0) from the (corrected)\n#    Kolmogorov-Chapman equations to establish relationships between the\n#    probabilities P0, P1, P2, and P3.\n# 2. Use the given numerical values for lambda to simplify these relationships.\n# 3.
