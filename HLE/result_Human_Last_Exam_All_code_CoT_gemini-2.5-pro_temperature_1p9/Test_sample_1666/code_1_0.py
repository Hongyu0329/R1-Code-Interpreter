    This function analyzes the provided legal scenario and determines the most accurate answer.
    
    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  **Bryan's Covenants:** In the context of a sale of business, restrictive covenants for a high-level executive like a CEO (Bryan) are generally considered reasonable and enforceable to protect the purchased goodwill.
    2.  **Ryan's Covenants:** The same covenants are likely unreasonable and unenforceable for a "Shift Manager" (Ryan), as the scope of the restrictions (province-wide non-compete, all-client non-solicit) is too broad for such a role.
    3.  **New Employees' Agreements:** Under Ontario law (Bill 27), non-competition clauses are prohibited for non-executive employees. The clauses are therefore unenforceable, but the remainder of the employment agreements would remain valid under the principle of severance.
    4.  **The Pickup Truck:** Bryan's promise to give Stan the truck was a gratuitous promise (a promise to make a gift). There was no consideration from Stan in exchange for the truck, so there is no enforceable contract. Bryan is not required to transfer it.

    Conclusion: All points align with Answer A.
