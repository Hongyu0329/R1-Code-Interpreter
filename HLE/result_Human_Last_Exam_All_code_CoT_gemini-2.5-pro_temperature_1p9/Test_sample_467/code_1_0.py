# Step 1: Define the parameters for the Morse index calculation.

# The Gauss map is g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
# The degree of the Gauss map, d_g, is the maximum of the degrees
# of the numerator (deg=1) and the denominator (deg=3).
d_g = 3

# The surface M is conformally equivalent to the complex plane C.
# This means its underlying compact surface is the Riemann sphere (genus k=0)
# with one puncture, which corresponds to the number of ends (d=1).
k = 0  # Genus of the surface
d = 1  # Number of ends

# Step 2: Apply the Lopez-Ros formula for the Morse index.
# Index = 2*d_g + 2*k + d - 3
index = 2 * d_g + 2 * k + d - 3

# Step 3: Print the result clearly explaining each term in the formula.
