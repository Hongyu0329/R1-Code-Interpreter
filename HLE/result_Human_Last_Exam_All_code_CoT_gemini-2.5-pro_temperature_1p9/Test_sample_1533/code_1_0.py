    This function provides a step-by-step derivation for the ratio BM/MI.
    
    The problem setup is as follows:
    - Triangle ABC has side lengths a (BC), b (CA), and c (AB).
    - I is the incenter, the intersection of angle bisectors.
    - The angle bisector of angle B (line BI) intersects the circumcircle of ABC at point M.
    
    The goal is to express the ratio BM/MI in terms of a, b, and c.
