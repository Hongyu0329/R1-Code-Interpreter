    "To calculate the symmetry factors for the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory, we first need to identify these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:** In $\\phi^4$ theory, vertices have 4 lines. Second-order diagrams in the coupling constant $\\lambda$ contain two vertices. Vacuum bubbles are diagrams with no external lines. We need to find all connected diagrams made of two 4-point vertices and the propagators connecting them. By analyzing the possible connections, we find there are exactly two such diagrams.\n\n2.  **Diagram 1: The \"Sunset\" Diagram**\n    *   This diagram consists of two vertices connected to each other by all four available propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation ($S_1$):** The symmetry factor is the order of the group of transformations that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n        *   We can swap the two vertices, which is a symmetry: a factor of 2.\n        *   We can permute the four identical propagators that connect the two vertices: a factor of $4!$ (4-factorial).\n        *   $S_1 = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n3.  **Diagram 2: The \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram**\n    *   This diagram consists of two vertices, each with a single propagator loop attached to itself. The two vertices are then connected to each other by two propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation ($S_2$):**\n        *   We can swap the two vertices, as they are identical (each has one loop and two connecting lines): a factor of 2.\n        *   We can permute the two identical propagators connecting the vertices: a factor of 2.\n        *   For the loop at the first vertex, we can swap the two half-lines making up the loop: a factor of 2.\n        *   Similarly, we can flip the loop at the second vertex: a factor of 2.\n        *   $S_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n4.  **Sum the Factors:** The final step is to sum the symmetry factors of all identified diagrams.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and sums the symmetry factors for the two second-order\n    vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Introduction\n    print(\"In phi^4 theory, there are two connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Diagram 1: Sunset diagram\n    print(\"1.
