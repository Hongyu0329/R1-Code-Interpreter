# The analysis of the problem suggests that the question in part (b)
# is best interpreted as asking for the necessary condition on the integer `d`
# for the map g(i) = n - d - i to be a valid permutation on the
# vertex set {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
#
# Our derivation showed that for g to map the set {0, ..., n-1} to itself,
# `d` must satisfy both d >= 1 and d <= 1.
# Therefore, the only possible integer value for `d` is 1.

# The final equation representing the condition on `d`.
condition_variable = "d"
condition_value = 1

# Print the final equation as requested.
print("The condition on d for the reflection g to be a well-defined vertex permutation is:")
print(f"{condition_variable} = {condition_value}")

# The prompt also asks to output each number in the final equation.
# In the equation `d = 1`, the only number is 1.
print("\nThe number in the final equation is:")
