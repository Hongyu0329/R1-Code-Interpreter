    # olfactory bulb moves from anterior to posterior.
    #
    # Model: Position = (slope * carbon_atoms) + intercept
    # - Let the anterior-posterior axis be represented by a number line where a
    #   larger number means a more posterior position.
    # - The 'slope' must be positive to reflect the principle.

    # The equation for the long chain molecule's position is:
