    "To find the radical for the Japanese character 謄, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I'll identify the specific kanji character in question, which is 謄.\n2.  Next, I'll determine its radical. The character 謄 belongs to the radical 言 (げん, gen).\n3.  When this radical appears on the left side of a character (a position known as へん, hen), it is called ごんべん (gonben).\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that uses a dictionary to store this information and prints the Hepburn transcription for the radical name, \"Gonben\".\n\n```python\ndef find_kanji_radical(character):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Hepburn name of the radical for a given kanji character.\n    This function uses a predefined dictionary for the lookup.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping kanji to the Hepburn transcription of their radical's name.\n    # The radical for 謄 is 言 (gen), which is called \"Gonben\" when on the left side.\n    radical_database = {\n        '謄': 'Gonben',\n        '媛': 'Onnahen' # Example from the prompt\n    }\n\n    if character in radical_database:\n        radical_name = radical_database[character]\n        print(f\"The bushu/radical for the character '{character}' is: {radical_name}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Radical information for the character '{character}' could not be found.\")\n\n# The kanji character provided in the user's request.\ntarget_kanji = '謄'\nfind_kanji_radical(target_kanji)\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
