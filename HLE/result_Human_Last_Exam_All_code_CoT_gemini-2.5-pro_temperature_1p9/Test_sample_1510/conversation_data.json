    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2:** First, we need to determine which crystallographic point groups in two dimensions have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. The point groups of order 2 are:\n    *   **C2:** This group contains two operations: the identity and a 180-degree (2-fold) rotation.\n    *   **D1 (also known as Cs or C1h):** This group contains two operations: the identity and a reflection across a line.\n\n2.  **Map Wallpaper Groups to Point Groups:** Next, we need to check which of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to these point groups (C2 or D1).\n\n3.  **Count the Groups:** We can create a script that stores the data for all 17 wallpaper groups and their point groups. The script will then filter this list to find only those with a point group order of 2, count them, and display the result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It programmatically finds and counts the relevant wallpaper groups and prints the names of the groups and the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef find_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds and counts the wallpaper groups with a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 17 wallpaper groups, including their point group and the order of the point group.\n    # The point group D1 is also known as Cs or C1h.\n    wallpaper_groups_data = [\n        {'name': 'p1',   'point_group': 'C1', 'order': 1},\n        {'name': 'p2',   'point_group': 'C2', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'pm',   'point_group': 'D1', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'pg',   'point_group': 'D1', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'cm',   'point_group': 'D1', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'p2mm', 'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p2mg', 'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p2gg', 'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'c2mm', 'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p3',   'point_group': 'C3', 'order': 3},\n        {'name': 'p3m1', 'point_group': 'D3', 'order': 6},\n        {'name': 'p31m', 'point_group': 'D3', 'order': 6},\n        {'name': 'p4',   'point_group': 'C4', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p4mm', 'point_group': 'D4', 'order': 8},\n        {'name': 'p4gm', 'point_group': 'D4', 'order': 8},\n        {'name': 'p6',   'point_group': 'C6', 'order': 6},\n        {'name': 'p6mm', 'point_group': 'D6', 'order': 12},\n    ]\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    print(f\"The point groups of order {target_order} are C2 and D1 (Cs).\")\n    \n    # Separate the groups by point group type for a clear explanation.\n    groups_C2 = [g['name'] for g in wallpaper_groups_data if g['point_group'] == 'C2' and g['order'] == target_order]\n    groups_D1 = [g['name'] for g in wallpaper_groups_data if g['point_group'] == 'D1' and g['order'] == target_order]\n    \n    count_C2 = len(groups_C2)\n    count_D1 = len(groups_D1)\n    total_count = count_C2 + count_D1\n    \n    print(f\"\\nNumber of wallpaper groups with point group C2: {count_C2}\")\n    print(f\"Group(s): {', '.join(groups_C2)}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nNumber of wallpaper groups with point group D1: {count_D1}\")\n    print(f\"Group(s): {', '.join(groups_D1)}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is:\")\n    # The final equation with each number printed explicitly.\n    print(f\"{count_C2} + {count_D1} = {total_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
