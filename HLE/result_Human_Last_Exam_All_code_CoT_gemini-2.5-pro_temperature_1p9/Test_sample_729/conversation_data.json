    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties**: The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$. In the general form $Q_{2^n}$, this corresponds to $n=7$. A key property of this group is its exponent, which is the smallest positive integer `m` such that $g^m=1$ for all elements `g` in the group. For $Q_{2^n}$, the exponent is $2^{n-1}$. For $Q_{128}$, this is $2^{7-1} = 64$.\n\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some integer `k`. It can be shown that the set of all distinct power subgroups of a group $G$ is given by $\\{G^d\\}$, where `d` ranges over all divisors of the exponent of $G$. Therefore, the number of distinct power subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of the group's exponent.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Divisors**: The final step is to calculate the number of divisors for the exponent we found, which is 64. I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will identify the exponent and then count its divisors.\n\n4.  **Format the Output**: The script will print the logical steps and display the divisors found. As requested, it will present the final count as a simple equation.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group Q_128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 128\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the parameter n for the group Q_{2^n}\n    # group_size = 2^n, so n = log2(group_size)\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group size must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n    print(f\"The generalized quaternion group of size {group_size} is denoted as Q_{{{group_size}}}, which is Q_{{2^{n}}}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the exponent of the group Q_{2^n}\n    # The exponent for Q_{2^n} (n>=3) is 2^(n-1).\n    exponent = 2**(n - 1)\n    print(f\"The exponent of this group is 2^({n}-1) = {exponent}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find all divisors of the exponent.\n    # The number of distinct power subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of the exponent.\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of the exponent, {exponent}.\")\n    \n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, exponent + 1):\n        if exponent % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    \n    num_divisors = len(divisors)\n    \n    print(f\"The divisors of {exponent} are: {', '.join(map(str, divisors))}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Display the final count as an equation.\n    # The final equation shows a '1' for each divisor found, summing to the total count.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(['1'] * num_divisors)\n    print(\"Each divisor corresponds to a unique power subgroup.
