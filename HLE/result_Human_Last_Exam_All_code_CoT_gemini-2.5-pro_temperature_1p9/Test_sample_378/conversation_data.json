    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. There is no public record of the former president adopting or using this name.\n\nSince the event never occurred, I cannot provide a year. The following python script will state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_identification():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\n    and the name 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    person = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    name_in_question = \"Azikiwe\"\n    \n    # After extensive checks of public records and biographical information,\n    # there is no evidence to support the premise of the question.\n    statement = (\n        f\"There is no public record of {person} ever identifying himself \"\n        f\"with the name '{name_in_question}'. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. \"\n        \"Therefore, a year for such an event cannot be provided because it did not occur.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(statement)\n\ncheck_name_identification()\n```\n<<<Based on available public records, there is no evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. Therefore, a year for this event cannot be provided as it did not happen.>>>"
