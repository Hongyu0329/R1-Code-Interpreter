    "To determine the number of let-7 family members in humans, I will rely on information from miRBase, the authoritative online database for microRNA sequences and annotation. The core human let-7 family members are identified by their unique mature sequences. I will write a Python script to list these members and then count them to provide the final number.\n\nThe members typically included in the human let-7 family are:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n9.  miR-98 (which shares the same seed sequence and is considered a let-7 family member)\n\nThe script will count these members to provide the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_human_let7_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of identified members of the let-7 family in humans.\n\n    This list is based on established data from microRNA databases like miRBase.\n    The let-7 family includes several microRNAs that share a highly conserved\n    seed sequence.
