    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to evaluate the integral.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the integral:** The task is to evaluate the quantum mechanical integral \\( \\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle \\) where both \\( \\phi_i \\) and \\( \\phi_j \\) are the same normalized \\(1s\\) Slater-Type Orbital (STO). This is the expectation value of the potential energy operator \\( 1/r \\), which is a key component in atomic structure calculations.\n2.  **Define the orbital:** A normalized \\(1s\\) Slater orbital is given by the formula:\n    \\[ \\phi_{1s}(r, \\zeta) = \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r} \\]\n    Here, \\( \\zeta \\) (zeta) is the orbital exponent, which determines the size of the orbital.\n3.  **Set up the integral:** The integral, in spherical coordinates, is:\n    \\[ \\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle = \\int_{\\text{all space}} \\phi_{1s}^* \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\phi_{1s} \\, dV \\]\n    Substituting the orbital and the volume element \\( dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\), we get:\n    \\[ I = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^{\\pi} d\\theta \\int_0^{\\infty} dr \\, \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right) r^2 \\sin\\theta \\]\n4.  **Simplify and separate:** The integral can be simplified and separated into three parts: a constant from the normalization factor, a radial integral over \\(r\\), and an angular integral over \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\).\n    \\[ I = \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right) \\times \\left(\\int_0^{\\infty} r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr\\right) \\times \\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi\\right) \\]\n5.  **Evaluate using Python:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform these integrations symbolically. The code will calculate each of the three parts and then multiply them to get the final result. I will print each part of the calculation to show how the final answer is obtained.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, pi, integrate, sin, oo, sqrt, pretty_print\n\ndef evaluate_1s_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a \n    normalized 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO) using symbolic mathematics.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Starting evaluation of the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater orbital.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Define symbolic variables\n    # r is the radial coordinate\n    # zeta is the orbital exponent\n    # theta and phi are the angular coordinates\n    r, zeta = symbols('r zeta', positive=True)\n    theta, phi = symbols('theta phi')\n\n    # The normalized 1s Slater orbital is phi_1s = (zeta**3 / pi)**(1/2) * exp(-zeta*r)\n    # The normalization constant squared is (zeta**3 / pi)\n    norm_const_sq = zeta**3 / pi\n    \n    # The integral can be separated into three parts:\n    # I = (Norm_Const^2) * (Radial Part) * (Angular Part)\n\n    # 1.
