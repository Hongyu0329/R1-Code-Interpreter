# The problem asks for the name of the chemical product based on spectroscopic evidence and reaction conditions.
# Based on the analysis, the product is a C10 spiroketone.
# The ¹³C NMR data (8 signals) specifically points to a structure with some magnetic equivalence.
# Spiro[4.5]decan-1-one is known to exhibit 8 ¹³C NMR signals due to accidental equivalence.
# This product can be formed from the pinacol-type rearrangement of decahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol.

product_name = "Spiro[4.5]decan-1-one"
