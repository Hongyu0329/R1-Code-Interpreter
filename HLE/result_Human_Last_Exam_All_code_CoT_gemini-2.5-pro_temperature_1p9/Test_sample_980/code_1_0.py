# The sequence ends with the pattern X, Y, X
# where X = 124 and Y = 36.
# The prompt hints at a "final equation" using the numbers.
# The most direct calculation is the difference between X and Y.

x = 124
y = 36

# Calculate the next number in the sequence based on the difference.
result = x - y

# Print the final equation with each number, as requested.
print(f"The next number is found with the equation: {x} - {y} = {result}")
