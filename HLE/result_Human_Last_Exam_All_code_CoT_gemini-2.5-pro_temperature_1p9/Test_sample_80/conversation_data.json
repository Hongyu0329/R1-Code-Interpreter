    "Here is my plan to solve this chess puzzle:\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Edge Squares:** First, I'll determine the total number of squares on the outer edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  **Divide by Color:** Bishops on light squares cannot attack bishops on dark squares. This means we can solve the problem for each color independently and then combine the results. I'll calculate how many edge squares are light and how many are dark.\n3.  **Find Maximum Bishops per Color:** I'll determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares of a single color (e.g., just the light-colored ones). A simple and effective strategy is to fill one entire edge (like the top row) with bishops of that color and then add as many as possible on the opposite edge without creating attacks.\n4.  **Calculate Total Bishops:** Since the board is symmetrical, the maximum number of bishops on dark edge squares will be the same as on light edge squares. I'll sum these two numbers to get the total number of bishops placed on the board.\n5.  **Find Empty Squares:** Finally, I'll subtract the total number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares. The result is the number of edge squares that lack bishops.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan, showing the calculation at each step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on them.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    board_size = 8\n    print(f\"Answering for a standard {board_size}x{board_size} chessboard.\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # Total squares = 8*8 = 64. Inner squares = 6*6 = 36. Edge = 64 - 36 = 28.\n    total_edge_squares = (board_size * 4) - 4\n    print(f\"The total number of edge squares is {total_edge_squares}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Divide the problem by square color.\n    # The edge squares are evenly split between light and dark colors.\n    edge_squares_per_color = total_edge_squares // 2\n    print(f\"The edge is made of {edge_squares_per_color} light and {edge_squares_per_color} dark squares.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops per color set.\n    # On the 14 light-colored edge squares, a maximal placement is 7 bishops\n    # (e.g., b1, d1, f1, h1 on the top row, and c8, e8, g8 on the bottom row).\n    # This configuration is non-attacking and covers all 14 light edge squares.\n    max_bishops_on_one_color = 7\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares of a single color is {max_bishops_on_one_color}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of bishops that can be placed.\n    # By symmetry, we can also place 7 bishops on the dark edge squares.\n    total_bishops_placed = max_bishops_on_one_color + max_bishops_on_one_color\n    print(f\"So, the total maximum bishops placed is {max_bishops_on_one_color} + {max_bishops_on_one_color} = {total_bishops_placed}.\")\n\n    # Step 5: Find the number of edge squares without bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - total_bishops_placed\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final answer is the total edge squares minus the total bishops placed.\")\n    print(f\"Result: The number of edge squares lacking bishops is {total_edge_squares} - {total_bishops_placed} = {empty_edge_squares}.\")\n\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
