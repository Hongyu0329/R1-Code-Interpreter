    "To determine where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died, we need to consult historical records. This isn't a calculation, but we can use code to lay out the known facts and the logical conclusion derived from them.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n2.  Establish Geoffrey Chaucer's known whereabouts and occupation during that period.\n3.  Based on these historical facts, draw the most logical conclusion about his location.\n4.  Present these facts and the conclusion in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef find_chaucer_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses historical data to determine Chaucer's likely location\n    at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Historical Facts\n    death_of_blanche_year = 1368\n    chaucer_role = \"Esquire in the English royal court\"\n    record_of_travel_1368 = \"No surviving records show Chaucer on a diplomatic mission abroad in the autumn of 1368.\"\n    commemorative_work = \"The Book of the Duchess, written in England for an English audience shortly after her death.\"\n\n    # Step-by-step reasoning\n    print(\"Step 1: Establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\")\n    print(f\"Blanche of Lancaster died in the year {death_of_blanche_year}.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Review Geoffrey Chaucer's status at that time.\")\n    print(f\"In {death_of_blanche_year}, Chaucer's primary role was as an '{chaucer_role}'.\")\n    print(f\"His home and place of work were in England.\")\n    print(f\"Fact Check: {record_of_travel_1368}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the evidence.\")\n    print(\"Given that Chaucer was in the service of the English court and not documented to be abroad, it is historically accepted that he was in England.\")\n    print(f\"His poem, '{commemorative_work}', further supports this conclusion.\")\n\n    # Final Answer\n    final_location = \"England\"\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: The evidence strongly indicates Geoffrey Chaucer was in {final_location}.\")\n\n\n# Run the analysis\nfind_chaucer_location()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
