Step-by-step Analysis:
1.  The patient is {days_post_op} days post-Whipple procedure, a major surgery. This long timeframe makes acute, immediate complications (like an acute transfusion reaction) unlikely.
2.  The key symptoms are severe hypoxemia (O2 saturation: {oxygen_saturation}% on {supplemental_oxygen_flow}L of oxygen), bilateral crackles, and severe respiratory distress. This clinical picture is classic for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
3.  The question is: what caused the ARDS? We need to evaluate the options based on this.
4.  Sepsis (Choice D) is a systemic inflammatory response to infection and is the most common cause of ARDS, especially in patients recovering from major surgery who are at high risk for infection. The timeline of several weeks is very consistent with the development of a post-operative infection (like an abdominal abscess or pneumonia) leading to sepsis.
5.  Other options are less likely:
    - Acute Transfusion Reaction (A): Occurs within hours to a day, not 29 days later.
    - Iodine Reaction (B): An acute reaction to contrast dye.
    - Respiratory Deconditioning (F): Does not cause acute, severe hypoxemia and bilateral crackles (pulmonary edema).
6.  Therefore, sepsis leading to ARDS is the most probable diagnosis that explains the timing, severity, and clinical signs.
