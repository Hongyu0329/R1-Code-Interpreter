# Step 1: Analyze the Folding
# The paper is folded four times in total (top-to-bottom, left-to-right, repeat).
# Each fold doubles the number of layers of paper.
num_folds = 4
num_layers = 2**num_folds
print(f"After {num_folds} folds, the paper has {num_layers} layers.")

# Step 2: Analyze the Cuts
# Four corners of the final folded square are cut.
# Each cut goes through all layers of the paper, creating a new line segment (edge) on each layer.
cuts_on_folded_paper = 4
total_new_cut_edges = cuts_on_folded_paper * num_layers
print(f"Making {cuts_on_folded_paper} cuts through {num_layers} layers creates a total of {total_new_cut_edges} new edges.")

# Step 3 & 4: Analyze the Boundary and Categorize Edges
# The original shape is a square with 4 edges and 4 corners.
original_edges = 4
print(f"The original square has {original_edges} edges.")

# When the four corners of a square are clipped, the original edges are shortened but still exist.
# The four original edges become the four longer sides of the resulting octagon.
# These are the "remnant" edges.
num_remnant_edges = 4
print(f"Cutting the corners of the square leaves {num_remnant_edges} remnant pieces of the original edges.")

# All the edges created by the cuts contribute to the final shape.
# These 64 new edges either form the shorter sides of the octagonal outer boundary or form the boundaries of the internal holes.
# We don't need to distinguish between them for the final count.
# The total number of edges is the sum of the remnant edges from the original shape and all the newly created cut edges.
print("The final shape's total edges are the sum of the remnant edges and all the new edges created by the cuts.")

# Step 5: Calculate the Total
total_edges = num_remnant_edges + total_new_cut_edges
print(f"Total Edges = {num_remnant_edges} (remnant edges) + {total_new_cut_edges} (new cut edges)")
print(f"The total number of edges is: {total_edges}")
print(f"So, the final equation is: {num_remnant_edges} + ({cuts_on_folded_paper} * {num_layers}) = {total_edges}")
