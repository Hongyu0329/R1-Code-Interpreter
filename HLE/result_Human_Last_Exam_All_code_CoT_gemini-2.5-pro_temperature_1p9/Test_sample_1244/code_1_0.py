# The final answer is determined by theoretical arguments about integer lattices.
# This script explains the reasoning for each part and prints the final formatted answer.

# Part (a): Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?

# Step 1: Recall the properties of even unimodular lattices.
# A fundamental theorem in lattice theory states that the rank 'n' of an even
# unimodular lattice must be a multiple of 8.

# Step 2: Apply this theorem to the given rank.
# The question specifies a rank of 12. Since 12 is not a multiple of 8,
# no even unimodular lattice of rank 12 exists.

# Step 3: Conclude based on non-existence.
# The statement "An even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2"
# is an existential statement. Since no such lattice exists, the statement is false.
# An object that does not exist cannot have any properties.
answer_a = "No"

# Part (b): Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3.
# Can L have a vector x such that x.x is congruent to 0 (mod 6) and x is a 3-primitive vector?

# Step 1: Model the lattice L using Kneser's neighbor construction.
# Since far(L) = 3, L is a 3-neighbor of Z^14.
# We can construct such a lattice L = {y in Z^14 | a.y = 0 (mod 3)} + Z(a/3).
# We need a primitive vector 'a' in Z^14 with 3 | a.a. Let a = (1, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0).
# This 'a' is primitive and a.a = 3, so it works. The sub-lattice is M = {y in Z^14 | a.y = 0 (mod 3)}.
# For this L, it can be shown that far(L)=3.

# Step 2: Define and construct a suitable vector x.
# We need an x in L where x.x is a multiple of 6 and x/3 is not in L. We seek x in M.
# For x in M, x/3 is in L iff (x = k*a mod 3 and (a.x)/3 = k mod 3) for some k in {0,1,2}.
# We need to find an x in M where this fails, and x.x is a multiple of 6.
# Let's test the vector x = (2, 2, -1, 3, 0, ..., 0).
# Check 1 (x in M): a.x = 1*2 + 1*2 + 1*(-1) = 3. This is 0 mod 3, so x is in M. We find (a.x)/3 = 1.
# Check 2 (x.x mod 6): x.x = 2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2 + 3^2 = 18. This is 0 mod 6.
# Check 3 (3-primitive): We test if x/3 is in L.
# We have x = (2,2,-1,3,0...) which is congruent to (2,2,2,0,0...) mod 3.
# Also 2*a = (2,2,2,0,0...). So x = 2*a mod 3, which sets k=2.
# Now check the second condition: is (a.x)/3 = k mod 3? This becomes 1 = 2 mod 3, which is false.
# The condition for x/3 to be in L fails, so x is 3-primitive.

# Step 3: Conclude.
# A suitable lattice L and vector x were found, so the answer is yes.
answer_b = "yes"

# Part (c): If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of
# type D_24, what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?

# Step 1: Identify the lattice L.
# The 24 even unimodular lattices in R^24 are the Niemeier lattices. The one with
# root system D_24 is unique. It is L = <D_24, h>, where D_24 is the root lattice
# D_24 = {x in Z^24 | sum of components is even}, and h = (1/2, 1/2, ..., 1/2).

# Step 2: Find the intersection sublattice M = L intersect Z^24.
# An element of L is y = x + k*h, where x is in D_24 and k is an integer.
# For y to be an integer vector, k*h must be an integer vector. This requires k to be even.
# Let k=2m. Then y = x + m*(2h).
# The vector 2h = (1, ..., 1) has an even component sum (24), so 2h is in D_24.
# This means y is a sum of vectors in D_24, so y is in D_24. Thus, M = D_24.

# Step 3: Calculate the indices d = [L:M] and d = [Z^24:M].
# [Z^24 : D_24] = 2. D_24 is the kernel of the surjective map from Z^24 to Z/2Z.
# [L : D_24] = 2, from the construction of L as an index 2 overlattice of D_24.
# Since both indices are 2, L is a 2-neighbor of Z^24.

# Step 4: Determine the smallest d (the farness).
# The farness must divide 2, so it can be 1 or 2.
# Farness=1 would mean L is isometric to Z^24. But L is an even lattice, while Z^24 is odd.
# So they cannot be isometric. The farness cannot be 1.
# Therefore, the smallest d is 2.
answer_c = 2
