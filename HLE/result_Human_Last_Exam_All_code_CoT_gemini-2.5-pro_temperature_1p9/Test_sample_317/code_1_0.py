        "1. Kenneth Burke's framework is built on the fundamental distinction between non-symbolic 'motion' and symbolic 'action'.",
        "2. For Burke, the Negative (e.g., 'not', 'no') is a purely linguistic invention. It does not exist in nature (the realm of motion). A thing simply *is*.",
        "3. The 'Tribal No' is, by its very name, a collection of prohibitions ('thou shalt not...'). It is entirely dependent on the existence of the Negative.",
        "4. Because the 'Tribal No' is built upon this symbolic/linguistic Negative, it must belong to the realm of 'action'.",
        "5. The term 'imaginal' is highly appropriate here. The ability to prohibit an act requires the capacity to *imagine* that act and its negation. This imaginative power is a cornerstone of symbolic action, differentiating it from the pure stimulus-response of the non-symbolic world.",
        "6. Therefore, the 'Tribal No' is in the realm of action because it is an imaginal, symbolic construct."
