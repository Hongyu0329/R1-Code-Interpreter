    step1 = "1. Burke's key distinction is between 'motion' (the non-symbolic, physical world) and 'action' (the symbolic, human world of choice and language)."
    step2 = "2. Burke argues that the 'Negative' (the concept of 'no' or 'not') is a purely linguistic invention. It does not exist in the realm of motion."
    step3 = "3. The 'Tribal No' refers to the foundational prohibitions and commandments of a society ('Thou shalt not...')."
    step4 = "4. Since the 'Tribal No' is fundamentally built upon the Negative, it must exist in the symbolic realm of 'action', not 'motion'."
    step5 = "5. The justification 'it is imaginal' fits perfectly. The ability to conceive of a prohibition requires the imaginative capacity to envision what is *not* being done. This imaginative faculty is a core component of symbolic action."
