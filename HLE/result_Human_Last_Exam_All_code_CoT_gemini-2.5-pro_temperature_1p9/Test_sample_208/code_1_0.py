    Calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 unit circles.

    This is a known mathematical problem. The solution for n=14 was proven
    by F. Fodor. The radius R of the large circle is related to the radius
    r of the small circles (r=1) by R = 2*x, where x is the largest root of
    the polynomial: 8x^8 - 16x^7 - 8x^6 + 12x^5 + 14x^4 - 4x^3 - 7x^2 + 1 = 0.
