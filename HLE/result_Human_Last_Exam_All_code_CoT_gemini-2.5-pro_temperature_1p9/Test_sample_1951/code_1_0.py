# Plan to find the incorrect statement about Attack Graphs.
#
# The goal is to analyze each of the five statements (A, B, C, D, E)
# regarding State Enumeration Graphs (SEG) and Logical Attack Graphs (LAG)
# and identify the one that is factually incorrect.
#

# Analysis of the statements:

# Statement A: "Both the worst-case time complexity required to generate both SEG and LAG is exponential time."
# This is CORRECT. SEG generation has exponential complexity due to state-space explosion.
# LAG generation, while producing a more compact graph, is also exponential in the worst case as the underlying problem is NP-hard.

# Statement B: "There are attack paths that can be represented by SEG but not by LAG."
# This is CORRECT. SEGs can represent non-monotonic state changes (e.g., an attacker disabling a security feature),
# which standard monotonic LAGs cannot represent.

# Statement C: "The reason why the size of LAG is overwhelmingly smaller than that of SEG is the monotonicity employed in LAG."
# This is CORRECT. The monotonicity assumption is a primary reason for the compactness of LAGs,
# as it avoids the need to represent states where conditions are revoked.

# Statement D: "Neither SEG nor LAG can calculate the probability of an event occurrence tied to a node if there is a loop structure in the graph."
# This is INCORRECT. This statement is too absolute. While calculating probabilities in cyclic graphs is a hard problem,
# it is not impossible. Advanced methods, such as modeling the system as a Markov chain (for SEGs),
# allow for the calculation of reaching certain states even in the presence of loops.
# Therefore, claiming they "cannot" is false.

# Statement E: "In general, LAG cannot handle negation operations except when applied to initial conditions, but SEG can."
# This is CORRECT. Negation often implies non-monotonicity (a condition changing from true to false).
# Standard LAGs are monotonic and thus struggle with this. SEGs model explicit states and can represent such changes as simple state transitions.

# Conclusion:
# Based on the analysis, statement D is the only incorrect explanation.

# The program will now determine and print the letter corresponding to the incorrect statement.
