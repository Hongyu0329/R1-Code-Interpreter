    "Of course. Here is a breakdown of the task and the Python code to determine the correct answer.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to model the technical characteristics of a *cambré derrière* in both the Vaganova and Balanchine methods. I will store these characteristics in a dictionary for easy comparison. The script will then iterate through the provided answer choices, comparing the stored technical details for each method, and print out an explanation of the key difference.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_methods():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the characteristics of a cambré derrière in Vaganova and Balanchine methods\n    to identify the primary difference.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data representing the stylistic and technical rules for each method.\n    methods_data = {\n        'Vaganova': {\n            'A. Arm placement during allongé': 'Strict, with arms typically moving through second to a high third or fifth position, maintaining classical lines.',\n            'B. Placement of hip': 'Hips are kept square and level to the front. The bend comes from the spine, not from tilting the pelvis.',\n            'C. Speed': 'Movement is generally deliberate and controlled to build strength and flexibility.',\n            'D. Degree of backbend': 'Emphasizes achieving maximum flexibility and a deep, full curve of the entire spine.',\n            'E.

Arm placement during allongé': 'Often more stylized and dynamic; can vary greatly depending on the choreography.',\n            'B.
