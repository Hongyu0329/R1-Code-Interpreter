    "To find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the equation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ and are left coprime.\n\n**1. Finding a preliminary factorization:**\n\nFirst, we express the transfer function matrix $H(s)$ with a common denominator for all its elements. The denominators are $(s+1)$ and $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$. The least common multiple is $d(s) = s^2-1$.\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{(s-1)(s-1)}{s^2-1} & \\frac{s^2-1}{s^2-1} \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis gives an initial, but not necessarily coprime, factorization with $D_1(s) = (s^2-1)I$ and $N_1(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-2s+1 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. This factorization is not coprime because the rank of $[D_1(s) \\ N_1(s)]$ drops at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n**2. Finding a minimal denominator matrix D(s):**\n\nWe seek a polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is also a polynomial matrix. Let $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $N(s)$ is:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, its elements must be polynomials.\nFrom the (1,1) element, we require $\\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$ to be a polynomial. This imposes conditions on $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{12}(s)$ at the roots of the denominator, $s=\\pm 1$.\n- At $s=1$, the numerator must be zero: $2d_{12}(1)=0 \\Rightarrow d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor $(s-1)$.\n- At $s=-1$, the numerator must be zero: $d_{11}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1)=0 \\Rightarrow 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1)=0$.\n\nTo find a simple polynomial solution, we can choose $d_{11}(s)=1$. The second condition becomes $4 + 2d_{12}(-1)=0 \\Rightarrow d_{12}(-1)=-2$. Since $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$, we can write $d_{12}(s)=c(s-1)$. At $s=-1$, this gives $c(-1-1)=-2 \\Rightarrow -2c=-2 \\Rightarrow c=1$. So we choose $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\nThis gives the first row of $D(s)$ as $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\nSimilarly, for the second row of $D(s)$, $[d_{21}(s) \\quad d_{22}(s)]$, we need to satisfy analogous conditions. To obtain a factorization where the degree of $\\det(D(s))$ is minimal (which corresponds to a coprime factorization), we make simple choices while ensuring $D(s)$ is invertible. A good choice is to make $D(s)$ triangular. Let $d_{21}(s)=0$.\n- The condition at $s=1$ becomes $2d_{22}(1)=0 \\Rightarrow d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor $(s-1)$.\n- The condition at $s=-1$ becomes $4d_{21}(-1)+2d_{22}(-1)=0 \\Rightarrow 0+2d_{22}(-1)=0 \\Rightarrow d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor $(s+1)$.\nSo, $d_{22}(s)$ must be a multiple of $(s-1)(s+1)=s^2-1$. The simplest non-trivial choice is $d_{22}(s)=s^2-1$.\nThis gives the second row of $D(s)$ as $[0 \\quad s^2-1]$.\n\n**3. The resulting factorization:**\n\nSo we have:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{s^2-1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s+1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**4. Verifying Coprimeness:**\n\nThe factorization is left coprime if the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex $s$.\n$[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\nThe rank is 2 for all $s$ because the determinant of the submatrix formed by columns 1 and 3 is $\\det\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2\\end{pmatrix} = 2$, which is a non-zero constant. Thus, the factorization is indeed left coprime.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to represent and print the final matrices.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef calculate_and_print_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script prints the matrices for a left coprime factorization of H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Set up pretty printing for clear output\n    sp.init_printing(use_unicode=True)\n    \n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sp.symbols('s')\n\n    # The left coprime factorization is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\n    # The derived matrices D(s) and N(s) are:\n    D = sp.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    N = sp.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [2, 0]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sp.pprint(D)\n    \n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sp.pprint(N)\n    \n    print(\"\\nIn equation form, this is:\")\n    print(\"\\nH(s) = \")\n    print(f\"inv( [{D[0,0]}, {D[0,1]}] )   *   [{N[0,0]}, {N[0,1]}]\")\n    print(f\"     [ {D[1,0]}, {D[1,1]}]           [ {N[1,0]}, {N[1,1]}]\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_and_print_factorization()\n```\n<<<D(s) = [[1, s - 1], [0, s**2 - 1]], N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]>>>"
