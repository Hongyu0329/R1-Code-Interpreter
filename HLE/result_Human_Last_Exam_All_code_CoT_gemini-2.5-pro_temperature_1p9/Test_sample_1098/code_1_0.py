    The problem describes a physical version of the Maxwell's demon thought experiment. The 'demon' is a one-way door, which acts as a Brownian ratchet. The task is to identify the key parameter that would allow this device to seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics by trapping all gas on one side, thus decreasing the gas's entropy.

    1.  The Second Law of Thermodynamics: In an isolated system at thermal equilibrium, entropy cannot decrease. An equal distribution of gas between two chambers is a high-entropy state. All gas moving to one chamber is a very low-entropy state. This cannot happen spontaneously.

    2.  The 'Demon' is Physical: The one-way door is not a magical entity; it is a physical object made of atoms. As such, it is also subject to thermal energy from its surroundings.

    3.  The Feynman Ratchet Principle: Physicist Richard Feynman demonstrated that if a ratchet-and-pawl mechanism (our one-way door) is at the same temperature as the surrounding gas, it will not work. The random thermal energy will cause the pawl (the locking part) to jiggle and bounce, allowing the ratchet to move backward as often as it moves forward. The door will fail to be 'one-way'.

    4.  The Requirement: To make the one-way door function as intended, it must NOT be in thermal equilibrium with the gas. A temperature difference is required. For example, if the door mechanism were held at a temperature much lower than the gas, its own thermal jiggling would be minimized. It could then effectively act as a one-way valve, allowing gas to accumulate on one side.

    5.  Final Answer Choice: This means the essential experimental parameter that must be controlled to create this non-equilibrium condition is Temperature. A pressure difference is the result, not the cause. Chamber size, gas type, and door size are design specifics, but the fundamental thermodynamic driver is a temperature gradient.
