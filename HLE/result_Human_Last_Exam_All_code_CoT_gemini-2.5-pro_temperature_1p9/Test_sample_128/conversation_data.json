    "To determine which quantum transformation is impossible, we need to verify if the given mappings can be represented by a single linear operator, as any quantum gate must be a linear transformation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent States**: First, we'll represent the six quantum basis states (`|0⟩`, `|1⟩`, `|+⟩`, `|-⟩`, `|i⟩`, `|-i⟩`) as 2-dimensional complex vectors using `numpy`.\n\n2.  **Linearity Principle**: A quantum gate `U` is a linear operator. This means that if a state `|ψ⟩` is a linear combination of other states, e.g., `|ψ⟩ = a|φ₁⟩ + b|φ₂⟩`, then the transformation must preserve this relationship: `U|ψ⟩ = a(U|φ₁) + b(U|φ₂)`. We can use the definitions of the basis states to check this:\n    *   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    *   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\n3.  **Phase Factors**: When a gate `U` acts on a state `|ψ⟩`, the resulting state `U|ψ⟩` might be equal to the target state `|ψ'⟩` up to a global phase factor `e^(iθ)`. That is, `U|ψ⟩ = c * |ψ'⟩`, where `c` is a complex number with an absolute value of 1.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check**: For each answer choice, we can derive the relationship that must hold between the phase factors `c₀` and `c₁` (for the transformations of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` respectively) from each of the four superposition definitions.\n    For example, from `|+⟩`, we get the relation `c₊ * |+'⟩ = (1/√2) * (c₀ * |0'⟩ + c₁ * |1'⟩)`, where `|0'⟩`, `|1'⟩`, and `|+'⟩` are the output states from the transformation table. This equation imposes a specific ratio between `c₀` and `c₁`. We do this for `|-⟩`, `|i⟩`, and `|-i⟩` as well.\n    A transformation is only possible if the calculated `c₀/c₁` ratio is consistent across all four checks. If we find conflicting requirements for this ratio, the transformation is not linear and thus impossible for any quantum gate.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: We will write a Python script to automate this check for all the provided options. The script will:\n    *   Define the state vectors.\n    *   Parse all transformations from A to W.\n    *   For each transformation, calculate the `c₀/c₁` ratio derived from the mappings of `|+⟩`, `|-⟩`, `|i⟩`, and `|-i⟩`.\n    *   If the ratios for a given transformation are not all consistent, we have found the impossible transformation.\n\nThe following Python code performs this systematic check.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks each transformation for linearity and finds the one that is impossible.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the six basis states as complex column vectors\n    s0 = np.array([[1], [0]], dtype=complex)\n    s1 = np.array([[0], [1]], dtype=complex)\n    states = {\n        '0': s0,\n        '1': s1,\n        '+': (s0 + s1) / np.sqrt(2),\n        '-': (s0 -

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In Quantum Computing, there are six basis states: ∣0⟩, ∣1⟩, ∣+⟩, ∣-⟩, ∣i⟩, and |-i⟩.\nThe Pauli-X gate transforms those six basis states in the following way on a single qubit:\n∣0⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣i⟩\n\nWhich one of the following transforms is NOT possible for ANY unitary Quantum gate operation to achieve on a single qubit?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣-i⟩\nB. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣i⟩\nC. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣i⟩\nD. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣+⟩\nE. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣-i⟩\nF. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣-i⟩\nG. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣-i⟩\nH. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩\nI. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣1⟩\nJ. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩\nK. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣+⟩\nL. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣-⟩\nM. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣1⟩\nN. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩\nO. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣-⟩\nP. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣1⟩\nQ. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩\nR. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣+⟩\nS. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣1⟩\nT. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩\nU. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣i⟩\nV. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣-⟩\nW. ∣0⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n∣1⟩  ->  ∣0⟩\n∣+⟩  ->  ∣-i⟩\n∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n∣i⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n∣-i⟩ ->  ∣+⟩\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
