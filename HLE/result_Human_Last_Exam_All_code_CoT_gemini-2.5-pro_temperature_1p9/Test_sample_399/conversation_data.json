    "To solve the initial value problem, we will first find the general solution to the differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the particular solution. Finally, we will evaluate the solution at the desired point.\n\n**1. Separate the variables:**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nAssuming $x \\neq 0$, we can separate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n**2. Integrate both sides:**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n**3. Apply the initial condition:**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to find $C$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\n\n**4. Find the particular solution:**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo solve for $x(t)$, we can first get a common denominator on the right side:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{4t^2 - 8t + 1}{8}\n$$\nAnd then solve for $x(t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = -\\frac{8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1}\n$$\n\n**5. Calculate x(1):**\nFinally, we substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution to find $x(1)$:\n$$\nx(1) = -\\frac{8}{4(1)^2 - 8(1) + 1}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = -\\frac{8}{4 - 8 + 1} = -\\frac{8}{-3} = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\nThe following Python code will perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variable\nt = sympy.symbols('t')\n\n# Define the numerator and the terms for the denominator of the solution x(t)\nnumerator = -8\na = 4\nb = -8\nc = 1\n\n# Value of t to evaluate at\nt_val = 1\n\n# Calculate the denominator at t=1\ndenominator = a * t_val**2 + b * t_val + c\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = sympy.Rational(numerator, denominator)\n\n# Print the equation and the steps\nprint(f\"From the derived solution x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1)\")\nprint(f\"We substitute t = {t_val}:\")\nprint(f\"x({t_val}) = {numerator} / ({a}*({t_val})^2 - {abs(b)}*({t_val}) + {c})\")\nprint(f\"x({t_val}) = {numerator} / ({a*t_val**2} - {abs(b)*t_val} + {c})\")\nprint(f\"x({t_val}) = {numerator} / ({denominator})\")\nprint(f\"x({t_val}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
