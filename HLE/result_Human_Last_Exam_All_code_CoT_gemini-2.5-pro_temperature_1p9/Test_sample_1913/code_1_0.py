# Step 1: Define the elliptic curve E from its minimal Weierstrass equation.
E = EllipticCurve([0, -1, 1, -10, -20])

# Step 2: Calculate the rank r of the Mordell-Weil group E(Q).
r = E.rank()

# Step 3: Get the two primitive cubic Dirichlet characters of conductor 7.
# We use the Complex Double Field (CDF) for numerical evaluation.
G = DirichletGroup(7, base_ring=CDF)
cubic_chars = [chi for chi in G if chi.order() == 3]
chi1 = cubic_chars[0]
chi2 = cubic_chars[1]

# Step 4: Compute the leading coefficients a and b of the Taylor series
# of the twisted L-functions at s=1.
# The E.lseries() function directly computes this value.
# For this curve and these twists, the order of vanishing is 0,
# so a = L(E, 1, chi1) and b = L(E, 1, chi2).
a = E.lseries(1, twist=chi1)
b = E.lseries(1, twist=chi2)

# Step 5: Calculate the sum r + a + b.
# Since chi2 is the complex conjugate of chi1, b is the conjugate of a.
# The sum r + a + b is a real number.
total_sum = r + a + b

# Output the individual numbers in the final equation as requested.
# The complex numbers a and b are formatted for clarity.

b_str = f"({b.real():.5f} + {b.imag():.5f}j)"

# The total_sum is a complex type in Sage, but its imaginary part is close to zero.
