    "The problem asks for the maximal rank of the complementary channel, denoted as `Λ^c`, for a Pauli channel `Λ` that acts on a `d`-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix, which is a key concept in quantum information theory.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will use a fundamental theorem that relates the rank of a channel `Λ` to the rank of its complementary channel `Λ^c`. This theorem states that their ranks are equal: `rank(Λ) = rank(Λ^c)`.\n2.  This simplifies the problem significantly. Instead of analyzing the complementary channel `Λ^c`, we only need to find the maximal possible rank of the Pauli channel `Λ` itself.\n3.  Next, I will determine what the rank of a Pauli channel depends on. A `d`-dimensional Pauli channel is defined by `Λ(ρ) = Σ p_jk U_jk ρ U_jk†`, where `U_jk` are the `d^2` generalized Pauli operators, and `p_jk` are probabilities. The rank of the channel is the number of linearly independent Kraus operators, which for this channel are `{sqrt(p_jk) * U_jk}`.\n4.  The `d^2` Pauli operators `U_jk` are known to be linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of the channel `Λ` is simply the number of non-zero probability coefficients `p_jk`.\n5.  To find the maximal rank, we need to maximize the number of non-zero `p_jk`. We can choose all `d^2` coefficients to be non-zero. A common example is the completely depolarizing channel, where `p_jk = 1/d^2` for all `j` and `k`.\n6.  This means the maximal rank of `Λ` is `d^2`.\n7.  Finally, using the equality from Step 1, the maximal rank of the complementary channel `Λ^c` must also be `d^2`.\n\nThe following Python code explains this reasoning to derive the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_explain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximal rank of the complementary channel \n    of a Pauli channel on a d-dimensional system.\n    \n    The dimension 'd' is treated symbolically, and the final answer is a formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The variable d represents the dimension of the qudit system.\n    # The final answer will be expressed in terms of d.\n    d_squared = \"d^2\"\n\n    print(\"This problem asks for the maximal rank of the complementary channel (Λ^c) of a Pauli channel (Λ) on a d-dimensional quantum system.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Relate the ranks of a channel and its complementary channel.\")\n    print(\"A key theorem in quantum information theory states that the Choi rank of a quantum channel is equal to the Choi rank of its complementary channel.\")\n    print(\"Mathematically: rank(Λ) = rank(Λ^c).\")\n    print(\"This means finding the maximal rank of Λ^c is equivalent to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel Λ itself.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the rank of a Pauli channel Λ.\")\n    print(\"A Pauli channel is defined as: Λ(ρ) = Σ_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_jk * U_jk * ρ * U_jk†, where {U_jk} are the d^2 generalized Pauli operators.\")\n    print(\"The rank of a channel equals the minimum number of Kraus operators in its operator-sum representation.
