    print("The rank of a channel equals the minimum number of Kraus operators in its operator-sum representation. For this Pauli channel, a valid set of Kraus operators is {sqrt(p_jk) * U_jk}.")

    print("Step 3: Find the maximal rank of Λ.")
    print(f"The {d_squared} generalized Pauli operators {U_jk} form a complete basis for the space of d x d matrices, which means they are linearly independent.")
    print("Because the operators U_jk are linearly independent, the rank of the channel Λ is simply equal to the number of non-zero probability coefficients p_jk.")
    print(f"To maximize this rank, we can choose the maximum number of p_jk to be non-zero. The maximum is {d_squared}, which occurs when all probabilities are positive (e.g., in the completely depolarizing channel).")
    print(f"Thus, the maximal rank of the Pauli channel Λ is {d_squared}.")
