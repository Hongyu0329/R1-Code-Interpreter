# Step 1: Determine the parameters a and lambda.
# Based on the analysis of the differential equation for y_2(x), we find the
# number of its positive extrema.
# y_2'(x) = y_h'(x) - (20/n)*x
# The Taylor series for y_h'(x) is found to be 1 - x + x^2/4 - x^3/24 + ...
# By analyzing the roots of y_h'(x) - (20/n)*x = 0 for the given n values,
# we determine that the function is monotonic decreasing from a positive value
# towards -infinity, meaning there is exactly one positive root in both cases.
a = 1
lambda_val = 1

# Step 2: Analyze and solve for y_3(x).
# The equation for y_3 is d^(1/2)y_3/dx^(1/2) + ((a - lambda) / lambda^a) * y_2s'(x) = 0.
# Let's calculate the coefficient.
coefficient = (a - lambda_val) / (lambda_val**a)

# The differential equation for y_3 simplifies because the coefficient is 0.
# d^(1/2)y_3/dx^(1/2) = -coefficient * y_2s'(x) = 0.
# Given y_3(0) = 0, the only solution is y_3(x) = 0.

# Therefore, y_3 evaluated at x_0 must be 0.
# x_0 = (pi/lambda)^lambda
pi = math.pi
x_0 = (pi / lambda_val)**lambda_val
y3_at_x0 = 0

# Step 3: Compute the final expression.
# The expression is (N + lambda) * (y_3(x_0))^(lambda/a).
# The value of N is not required because it is multiplied by a term that evaluates to zero.

exponent = lambda_val / a
# The calculation simplifies to (N + 1) * 0^1, which is 0.
