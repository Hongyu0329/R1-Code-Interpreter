    # Evaluation of each answer choice
    print("Step 1: Evaluating Choice A - Enhancement of DNA acetylation.")
    explanation_a = "This choice suggests barrier elements enhance the acetylation of DNA. This is incorrect on a fundamental level. Acetylation is a modification that happens to histone proteins, not directly to the DNA molecule. While promoting histone acetylation is a known mechanism to create an active chromatin state (euchromatin), the statement's reference to 'acetylation of DNA' is inaccurate."

    print("-" * 60)

    print("Step 2: Evaluating Choice B - Recruitment of demethylating enzymes.")
    explanation_b = "This suggests barriers recruit enzymes to demethylate heterochromatin. Since heterochromatin is characterized by specific histone methylation marks (like H3K9me3), recruiting a histone demethylase is a plausible active mechanism to counteract the spread. This is a valid function for some barriers but may not represent the single primary mechanism for all."
    print(textwrap.fill(explanation_b, width=80))
    print("-" * 60)

    print("Step 3: Evaluating Choice C - Insulating nucleosomes from all modifications.")
    explanation_c = "This choice proposes that barriers prevent *any* acetylation or methylation. This is too absolute. The function of a barrier is not to create a 'blank' chromatin state, but rather to prevent the encroachment of repressive marks while often actively maintaining an open, euchromatic state. Therefore, preventing all modifications is unlikely."
    print(textwrap.fill(explanation_c, width=80))
    print("-" * 60)

    print("Step 4: Evaluating Choice D - Disruption of histone-DNA interactions.")
    explanation_d = "This choice suggests barriers destabilize heterochromatin by disrupting histone-DNA interactions, for instance by creating a nucleosome-free region. This is another plausible mechanism, often involving ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. Like option B, this describes a valid function but may not be the most universal or 'primary' aspect."
    print(textwrap.fill(explanation_d, width=80))
    print("-" * 60)

    print("Step 5: Evaluating Choice E - Sequence-specific protein binding and steric hindrance.")
    explanation_e = "This option describes barrier elements as DNA sequences that are bound by specific proteins, and that this complex then acts as a physical block (steric hindrance) to the spreading heterochromatin machinery. This is considered the most fundamental and primary aspect of barrier function. The defining feature of a barrier *element* is its DNA sequence which recruits specific *proteins* (e.g., Su(Hw), BEAF-32 in Drosophila). The formation of this large DNA-protein complex is the initial and key event. Steric hindrance is a major, widely accepted model for how this complex performs its blocking function. Other functions (like recruiting enzymes) are often downstream of this initial binding event."

    # Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Choice E describes the most fundamental and widely applicable mechanism. The primary event is the binding of specific proteins to the barrier DNA sequence. This complex can then act as a physical impediment (steric hindrance), which is a core and primary model of its function.")
    print("Therefore, this is the best description of the primary molecular function.")
