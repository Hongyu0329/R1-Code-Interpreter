    "My plan is to answer the user's factual question about mycology.\n\n1.  First, I will identify the specific genus of mushroom known for having a blue spore print. While this is a rare trait, my knowledge base points to a particular genus where some species exhibit this characteristic.\n2.  Next, as requested, I will write a simple Python script.\n3.  The script will store the name of the genus in a variable.\n4.  Finally, it will print the answer in a clear sentence for the user.\n\n```python\ndef get_mushroom_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the single genus of mushroom\n    known to produce a distinctly blue spore print.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus Entoloma is known for its generally pinkish spore prints.\n    # However, it is the genus most frequently cited as having species\n    # (e.g., in the subgenus Leptonia) that can produce spores with\n    # distinct blue, blue-green, or violaceous tints, a unique feature.\n    genus_name = \"Entoloma\"\n    print(f\"The name of the single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print is: {genus_name}\")\n\nget_mushroom_genus()\n```\n<<<Entoloma>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    There is a single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print, what is its name?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
