    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will address the core physics question. To do this, I need to understand the requirements for a material to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The key requirement is a lack of inversion symmetry in the material's crystal structure. Materials that have inversion symmetry are known as centrosymmetric, and they cannot exhibit SPDC.\n\nNext, I will research the crystal structure of the most common and stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (also known as borophene). These are typically the β12 and χ3 phases.\n\nThen, by examining the space groups of these crystal structures, I can determine if they possess inversion symmetry. Both β12 (*Pmmn*) and χ3 (*Cmcm*) borophene phases are centrosymmetric.\n\nBased on this, I can conclude that ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to show SPDC. I will also include an important caveat that real-world effects like strain or defects could potentially break this symmetry.\n\nFinally, to fulfill the request for a coding solution, I will provide a Python script that programmatically represents this logic. The script will define the properties of the borophene phases and use a function to check for the conditions required for SPDC, printing a detailed explanation of the results.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_spdc_potential(materials):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential for materials to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric\n    Down-Conversion (SPDC) based on their crystal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) in Boron Nanosheets ---\\n\")\n\n    # SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\n    # A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit this effect\n    # is that it must lack a center of inversion symmetry.\n    # Materials with inversion symmetry are 'centrosymmetric'.\n    # Centrosymmetric materials have a second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of zero.\n    spdc_rule = \"SPDC requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure (i.e., inversion_symmetry = False).\"\n    print(f\"Physical Principle: {spdc_rule}\\n\")\n\n    spdc_expected_overall = False\n\n    print(\"Investigating common free-standing borophene phases:\")\n    for key, props in materials.items():\n        name = props['name']\n        space_group = props['space_group']\n        has_inversion_symmetry = props['inversion_symmetry']\n\n        # Determine if SPDC is expected for this phase\n        if not has_inversion_symmetry:\n            spdc_expected_overall = True\n            conclusion = f\"is NOT centrosymmetric.
