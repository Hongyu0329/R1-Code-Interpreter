# checking that it reduces to the provided approximate formula in the specified
# limits (massless neutrino, m_nu -> 0, and low energy, E_nu << M), and by
# consulting external literature for the complete formula.

# The kinematic factor K from option F is:
# K = 1 - T/E_nu - M*T/(2*E_nu**2) - m_nu**2/(2*E_nu**2) - m_nu**2*T/(4*M*E_nu**2)
# We can represent the terms and their numerical coefficients.
