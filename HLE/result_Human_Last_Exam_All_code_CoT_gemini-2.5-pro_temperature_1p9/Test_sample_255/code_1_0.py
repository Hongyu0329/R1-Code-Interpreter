def calculate_cohomology_dimension():
    """
    Calculates the dimension of the cohomology group H^2(G,M).

    The calculation follows a multi-step cohomological argument:
    1. The group G has a central subgroup C = <a^8> isomorphic to Z.
       The quotient group Gamma = G/C is the free product C_8 * C_8.
    2. We use the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, with E_2^{p,q} = H^p(Gamma, H^q(C,M)).
    3. The cohomology H^q(C,M) is non-zero only for q=0,1.
       Let V = H^0(C,M) and W = H^1(C,M).
    4. An analysis of the spectral sequence shows that H^2(G,M) is isomorphic to H^1(Gamma, W).
    5. The dimension of H^1(Gamma, W) is found using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for free products.
