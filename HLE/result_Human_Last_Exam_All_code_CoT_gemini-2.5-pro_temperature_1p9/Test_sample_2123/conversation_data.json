    "Here is my plan to solve this literary puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify the location:** The \"wide boulevards of Vienna\" is a strong clue for the Ringstrasse, the famous circular grand boulevard in Vienna.\n2.  **Identify the language and context:** The puzzle specifies a \"Russian translation,\" which points to a specific text. The connection between a place name and a poet's name suggests a pun or a sound association.\n3.  **Find the literary source:** The reference is famously from the writings of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam. In his essay \"Journey to Armenia\" (\"Путешествие в Армению\"), he describes his impressions of different European cities.\n4.  **Uncover the pun:** When writing about Vienna, Mandelstam mentions the Ringstrasse, which in Russian is often called simply \"the Ring\" (Ринг). He makes a sound-based connection between the name \"Ring\" and the surname of a well-known English poet.\n5.  **Identify the poet:** The English surname that sounds like \"Ring\" in this context is Browning. Therefore, the poet is Robert Browning.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this surname.\n\n```python\n# The puzzle describes a literary allusion made by the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam.\n# The wide boulevards of Vienna refer to the Ringstrasse.\n# In Russian, the Ringstrasse is often called \"Ринг\" (pronounced \"Ring\").\n# Mandelstam made a famous pun, associating the sound of \"Ring\" with the surname of a prominent English poet.\n\n# The English poet whose surname creates this pun is Robert Browning.\npoet_surname = \"Browning\"\n\n# The following line will print the final answer.\nprint(poet_surname)\n```\n<<<Browning>>>"
