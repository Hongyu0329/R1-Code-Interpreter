    This function outlines the argument for finding the cardinality of the set of continuous functions
    f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).

    Let S be the set of such functions.

    1. Properties of f:
       - Injectivity: If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which means exp(x1) = exp(x2), so x1 = x2.
         Thus, f is injective.
       - Monotonicity: A continuous injective function on R must be strictly monotonic.

    2. Case 1: f is strictly decreasing.
       - If f is decreasing, f(f(x)) is increasing, which is consistent with exp(x).
       - Let R(f) be the range of f. The range of f(f(x)) is f(R(f)), so f(R(f)) = (0, infinity).
       - This implies that for any y in R(f), f(y) > 0.
       - Also, any value z = f(y) in f(R(f)) must itself be in R(f).
       - This means (0, infinity) is a subset of R(f).
       - Since f is decreasing, its range R(f) containing (0, infinity) must be of the form (L, infinity)
         where L = lim_{x->inf} f(x). For f to be decreasing, L must be <= 0.
       - Let's analyze the limit: As x -> inf, exp(x) -> inf, so f(f(x)) -> inf.
       - Let y = f(x). As x -> inf, y -> L+. So, lim_{y->L+} f(y) = inf.
       - For a decreasing function, this implies L = -infinity.
       - So R(f) must be (-infinity, infinity), i.e., all of R.
       - But from f(y) > 0 for all y in R(f), this would mean f(y) > 0 for all y in R.
       - This contradicts R(f) being R. Thus, no decreasing solutions exist.

    3. Case 2: f is strictly increasing.
       - The equation f(x) = x would imply x = exp(x), which has no real solutions. Thus f(x) is never x.
       - Since f(x) - x is continuous and never zero, it's either always positive or always negative.
       - If f(x) < x for all x, then f(f(x)) < f(x), so exp(x) < f(x). This leads to exp(x) < x, which is false.
       - Therefore, f(x) > x for all x. This implies f(f(x)) > f(x), so exp(x) > f(x).
       - So any increasing solution satisfies x < f(x) < exp(x).

    4. Construction and Cardinality:
       - We can construct solutions by defining f on a starting interval.
       - Let f(0) = c. From the inequality above, 0 < c < exp(0) = 1.
       - Define f on [0, c] as any strictly increasing continuous function h from [0, c] to [c, 1].
         Note that f(c) = f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1, so the mapping is correct.
       - This choice of h, along with the equation f(f(x))=exp(x), determines f uniquely over all of R.
       - The number of choices for c in (0, 1) is the cardinality of the continuum, c.
       - For any given c, the number of choices for the function h is also the cardinality of the continuum, c.
       - For instance, we can represent h as a linear part plus a "bump" function g. The space of
         continuous g is of dimension c.
       - Therefore, there are at least c solutions.
       - The set of all continuous functions from R to R has cardinality c.
       - Therefore, the cardinality of the set S must be exactly the cardinality of the continuum.

    # The cardinality of the continuum is often denoted by 'C' or 'c'
