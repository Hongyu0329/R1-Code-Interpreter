import sympy as sp

# Step 1: Define N as a symbol for symbolic mathematics.
# N represents the dimension parameter in the CP(N-1) model.
N = sp.Symbol('N')

# Step 2: The mass ratio R between the subsequent excitation (k=2) and the
# lightest excitation (k=1) in the CP(N-1) spectrum is given by the formula:
# R(N) = m_2 / m_1 = sin(2 * pi / N) / sin(pi / N)
# We define this expression using sympy.
ratio_expression = sp.sin(2 * sp.pi / N) / sp.sin(sp.pi / N)

# Step 3: We can simplify this expression. Using the trigonometric identity
# sin(2x) = 2*sin(x)*cos(x), the expression simplifies to 2*cos(pi/N).
# Sympy can perform this simplification automatically.
simplified_ratio = sp.simplify(ratio_expression)

# Step 4: The problem asks for the asymptotic ratio as N approaches infinity.
# We calculate the limit of the simplified expression as N -> oo.
asymptotic_limit = sp.limit(simplified_ratio, N, sp.oo)

# Step 5: Print the results and the final equation.
