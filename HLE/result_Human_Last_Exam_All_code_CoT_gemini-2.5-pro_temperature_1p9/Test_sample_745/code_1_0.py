    Solves the topological problem by explaining the relevant theorem and its application.
    
    The problem is:
    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c,
    A a connected subset of X, and C a component of X \setminus A.
    What is the largest number of components X \setminus C can have?

    The solution is based on a standard theorem in general topology.
