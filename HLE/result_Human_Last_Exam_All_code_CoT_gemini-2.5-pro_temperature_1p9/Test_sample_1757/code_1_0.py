    Calculates the sum over all natural dimensions of the specified ratio.

    The problem asks for Sum_{d=1 to inf} R(d), where R(d) is a ratio
    of expected values for a given dimension d.

    The derivation gives the formula for the ratio R(d):
    R(d) = (d+1) / (d! * 2^d * (1 + (d-1) * I_2D))
    where I_2D is the expected distance between two orthogonal points,
    I_2D = E[sqrt(x^2 + y^2)] for x, y ~ U(-1, 1).
    This value is (sqrt(2) + asinh(1)) / 3.

    The code calculates this sum by iterating through d until the terms
    become negligible, and prints the equation of the sum as requested.
