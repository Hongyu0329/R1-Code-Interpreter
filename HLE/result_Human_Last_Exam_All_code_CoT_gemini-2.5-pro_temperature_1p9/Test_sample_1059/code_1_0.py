def find_closepact_sets():
    """
    Identifies which of the given sets are necessarily closepact.

    The logic is based on the following equivalences for the given sets:
    closepact <=> compact (since all are Hausdorff spaces)
    compact <=> closed and bounded (by the Heine-Borel theorem for subsets of R and C)
