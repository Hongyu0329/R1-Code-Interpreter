    # Step 1: Decompose the operator into radial modes (L_k).
    # The operator L can be separated into a family of 1D operators L_k using
    # spherical harmonics Y_k. The total number of positive eigenvalues is the
    # sum of positive eigenvalues over all modes k = 0, 1, 2, ...
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the potential and essential spectrum.
    # The essential spectrum of each L_k is (-inf, 0]. Positive discrete eigenvalues
    # can only exist if the operator's potential is sufficiently positive.
    # The potential term for mode k is V_k = -k(k+n-2)/<rho>^2 + n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n).
    # For k >= 1, V_k is negative for large rho, which prevents discrete eigenvalues > 0.
