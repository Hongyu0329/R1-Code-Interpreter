    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution, followed by the Python code to display the final formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation Plan\n\n1.  **Start with the Definition:** The grand canonical partition function, Z, is defined as the trace (`Tr`) over the Hilbert space of the system:\n    `Z = Tr[ e^(-β(H - μN)) ]`\n    where `β` is the inverse temperature (1/k_B T), `H` is the Hamiltonian operator, `μ` is the chemical potential, and `N` is the particle number operator.\n\n2.  **Introduce Imaginary Time:** The term `e^(-β(H - μN))` is analogous to the time evolution operator `e^(-itH/ħ)` if we make the substitution `t = -iħβ`. This \"evolution\" happens in imaginary time `τ`, from `τ=0` to `τ=β`. The evolution is governed by the grand canonical Hamiltonian `K = H - μN`.\n\n3.  **Break Down the Evolution (Trotterization):** To form a path integral, we slice the imaginary time interval `β` into a large number `M` of small steps of size `ε`, such that `β = Mε`. The partition function becomes:\n    `Z = Tr[ (e^(-εK))^M ]`\n\n4.  **Insert Complete Sets of States:** We insert a complete set of states (e.g., coherent states for bosons, or Grassmann fields for fermions) between each small evolution step `e^(-εK)`. The trace operation `Tr[...]` implies we start and end with the same state and integrate/sum over all possibilities, which naturally enforces the boundary conditions.\n\n5.  **Take the Continuum Limit:** As we let the number of time slices `M → ∞` (and `ε → 0`), the sum over all intermediate states becomes a functional integral (a \"path integral\") over all possible field configurations `ψ(x, τ)` and their conjugates `ψ*(x, τ)` in spacetime.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Action:** The argument of the exponential in the path integral becomes the Euclidean Action, `S`. This action is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian, `L_E`, over imaginary time `τ` and space `x`.\n    `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n    The standard prescription for finding the Lagrangian density `L_E` from the grand canonical Hamiltonian `K(a†, a)` is to replace the creation (`a†`) and annihilation (`a`) operators with the fields `ψ*` and `ψ` respectively, and add a \"kinetic\" term in imaginary time, `ψ* ∂_τ ψ`.\n\n7.  **Final Expression:** This process results in the Euclidean action `S`:\n    `S[ψ*, ψ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ ψ*(x,τ) ∂_τ ψ(x,τ) + H(ψ*,ψ) - μψ*(x,τ)ψ(x,τ) ]`\n    The fields `ψ(x, τ)` must obey boundary conditions in imaginary time:\n    *   **Bosons:** Periodic `ψ(x, 0) = ψ(x, β)`\n    *   **Fermions:** Anti-periodic `ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)`\n\nThis theoretical result can be presented clearly using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the grand canonical partition function Z\n    using the path integral formulation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The grand canonical partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian H' = H - μN, expressed using the path integral formalism, is as follows.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 110)\n\n    # Define the components of the formula as strings\n    partition_function = \"Z = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] * exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])\"\n    \n    action_integral = \"S[ψ*, ψ] = ∫[from 0 to β] dτ * ∫dᵈx * L_E\"\n    \n    lagrangian_density = \"L_E = ψ*(x, τ) * (∂/∂τ)ψ(x, τ) + H(ψ*, ψ) - μ*ψ*(x, τ)ψ(x, τ)\"\n\n    # Print the final equation with each part clearly defined\n    print(f\"The partition function is a functional integral over all field configurations:\\n\\n    {partition_function}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Where S[ψ*, ψ] is the Euclidean Action, which is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density (L_E):\")\n    print(f\"\\n    {action_integral}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The Euclidean Lagrangian density L_E is given by:\")\n    print(f\"\\n    {lagrangian_density}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The symbols in the equation represent:\")\n    print(f\"  - Z: The Grand Canonical Partition Function\")\n    print(f\"  - ∫D[ψ*, ψ]: The functional ('path') integral over the fields ψ and its conjugate ψ*\")\n    print(f\"  - S: The Euclidean Action\")\n    print(f\"  - τ: Imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β\")\n    print(f\"  - β: Inverse temperature, 1 / (k_B * T)\")\n    print(f\"  - d: The number of spatial dimensions\")\n    print(f\"  - H(ψ*, ψ): The original Hamiltonian density, with operators replaced by fields\")\n    print(f\"  - μ: The chemical potential\")\n    print(f\"  - N = ∫dᵈx ψ*ψ: The particle number\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: The fields ψ have (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in τ: ψ(x, τ) = ±ψ(x, τ + β) for bosons/fermions.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 110)\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\ndisplay_partition_function()\n```\n<<<Z = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] * exp(- ∫[from 0 to β] dτ * ∫dᵈx * [ψ*(∂/∂τ)ψ + H(ψ*, ψ) - μψ*ψ])>>>"
