    Solves the problem of finding the maximal genus of a specific type of surface.

    The problem asks for the maximal genus of the boundary of a compact region
    in R^3, given its mean curvature vector never vanishes.

    Step 1: The condition implies the mean curvature H is always positive.
    Any such surface must have a point of maximal distance from the origin. At this
    point, the mean curvature must be positive. Since H is continuous and never
    zero, H must be positive everywhere.

    Step 2: Check low-genus examples.
    - Genus 0 (Sphere): A sphere has H = 1/R > 0. It is a valid boundary. So g=0 is possible.
    - Genus 1 (Torus): A torus of revolution can be constructed to have H > 0 everywhere
      (by choosing its major radius R to be more than twice its minor radius r). It is
      also a valid boundary. So g=1 is possible.

    Step 3: Consider higher genera.
    While advanced results show existence of higher-genus embedded surfaces with constant
    mean curvature, these are typically considered advanced and "exotic" constructions.
    Many classical results and results under additional common assumptions (like stability)
    limit the genus to 0. The torus is a very classical counterexample to these stricter
    conditions. In the context of a problem with simple integer answers, it's most
    plausible that the torus is the intended limit. Therefore, we conclude the maximal genus is 1.

    There is no complex equation, the maximal genus is determined by this analysis.
