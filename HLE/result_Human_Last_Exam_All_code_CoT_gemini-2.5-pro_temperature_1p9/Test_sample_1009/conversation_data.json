    "The problem asks for the largest possible weight of a compact, first-countable topological group $G$ with cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$. The fact that the group might not be Hausdorff is a crucial piece of information.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  I will start with the fundamental formula relating the weight ($w(G)$), density ($d(G)$), and character ($\\chi(G)$) of a topological group: $w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n2.  The condition that the group $G$ is first-countable means its character $\\chi(G)$ is the first infinite cardinal, $\\aleph_0$. This will simplify the formula for the weight.\n3.  I will then use a key theorem from the theory of cardinal invariants of topological groups which provides an upper bound for the density $d(G)$ of any first-countable group.\n4.  Combining these results gives an upper bound for the weight $w(G)$.\n5.  The given large cardinality of $G$ is used to confirm that the group must be non-Hausdorff, as a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group has a cardinality constraint that is violated here.\n6.  Finally, I'll argue that the derived upper bound for the weight is sharp, meaning it is the largest possible weight. This relies on known constructions in topology of groups with precisely these properties.\n7.  I will present this reasoning in a Python script that prints the explanation and the final answer. The cardinal numbers will be represented symbolically.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_group_weight():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the largest possible weight of a compact,\n    first-countable topological group G with cardinality 2^(2^c).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We represent the infinite cardinal numbers symbolically as strings.\n    aleph_0 = \"‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ\"\n    c = \"ùî†\" # The continuum, 2^‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Relate weight, density, and character.\")\n    print(\"For any topological group G, the weight w(G), density d(G), and character œá(G) are related by:\")\n    print(f\"w(G) = d(G) * œá(G)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the first-countability property.\")\n    print(f\"The group G is given to be first-countable.
