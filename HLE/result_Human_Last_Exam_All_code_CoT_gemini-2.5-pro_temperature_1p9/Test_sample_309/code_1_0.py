def calculate_max_marginalized_landmarks():
    """
    Determines the maximum number of landmarks that can be marginalized in a
    bundle adjustment problem while ensuring the system remains solvable.

    In bundle adjustment, the problem's solvability (beyond the inherent 7-DOF gauge freedom)
    depends on having a rigid geometric structure. This structure is defined by the 3D landmarks.

    - 1 landmark is not enough to constrain camera poses.
    - 2 landmarks define a line but allow for rotational ambiguity around that line.
    - A minimum of 3 non-collinear landmarks are required to form a rigid reference
      frame. This removes geometric ambiguities and allows for a unique solution
      for the camera poses.

    Therefore, to ensure the problem remains solvable, at least 3 landmarks must be
    kept in the optimization state. The rest can be marginalized using techniques
    like the Schur complement.

    The number of cameras (M) does not alter this minimum requirement for a rigid structure.
