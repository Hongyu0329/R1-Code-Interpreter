    "Of course, I can help you solve this graph theory problem. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Graph:** First, I'll clarify what \"sum of three cycles\" means in this context. The standard interpretation that significantly impacts the chromatic number is the **graph join** operation, denoted by `+`. The graph \\( G \\) is the join of three disjoint cycles of length \\( n \\), which we can write as \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\).\n\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Join:** I'll use the well-known formula for the chromatic number of a graph join: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This generalizes to more than two graphs, so for our problem, \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle:** The chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd (\\(n \\ge 3\\)), \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even (\\(n \\ge 4\\)), \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Maximal Value:** By calculating \\( \\chi(G) \\) for both cases (odd and even \\( n \\)), we can find the maximum possible value. The case that maximizes \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) will also maximize \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that implements this logic and prints the step-by-step calculation, including the final equation with all its numbers, to arrive at the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the\n    sum (join) of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the graph G and the 'sum' operation.\")\n    print(\"The graph G is the sum of three cycles of length n.
