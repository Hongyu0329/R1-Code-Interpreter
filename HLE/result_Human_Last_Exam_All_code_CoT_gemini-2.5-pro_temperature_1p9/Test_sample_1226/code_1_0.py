    Calculates the maximum point value of white material for a mate in >= 6 moves.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  A mate-in-6 can be constructed using an "unblocking" theme.
    2.  This requires the Black King to shuttle between two squares (e.g., a1, b1).
    3.  It also requires one additional empty square for the unblocking maneuver to begin.
    4.  This means a total of 3 squares must be empty at various points in the sequence.
    5.  The board has 64 squares. Two are occupied by the Black and White Kings.
    6.  The number of squares available for other White pieces is 64 - 2 (kings) - 3 (empty) = 59.
    7.  To maximize the material's point value, all 59 pieces are assumed to be Queens.
    8.  The value of a Queen is 9 points.
