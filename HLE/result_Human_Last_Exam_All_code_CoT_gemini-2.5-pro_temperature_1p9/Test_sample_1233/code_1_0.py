        "2. Key Characteristics: Campylobacter is a fragile, slow-growing bacterium. Its viability decreases significantly with time and exposure to oxygen.",
        "3. Likely Error: The time delay in processing the sample likely led to a significant decrease in the number of living Campylobacter bacteria plated onto the agar.",
        "4. Observed Result: A fast-growing contaminant (Bacillus) outcompeted and obscured the target organism within the initial 48-hour incubation period."

        "5. The core issue is a low number of viable, slow-growing target bacteria.",
        "6. Because the initial number of Campylobacter was low, more time is required for them to multiply and form a visible colony.",
