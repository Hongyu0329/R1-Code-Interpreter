    """
    Calculates the limit of the probability p_n based on a step-by-step mathematical argument.

    The problem asks for the limit of p_n, the probability that a 2D simple random walk
    conditioned to avoid the origin, starting from (0,1), eventually enters a disk
    of radius n^(1/3) centered at (n,0).

    Our analysis follows these steps:
    1. The conditioned random walk escapes to infinity along a path that approximates a 
       random straight ray from the origin.
    2. The walk exhibits diffusive fluctuations of size O(sqrt(R)) around this ray at a 
       distance R.
    3. The target is a disk of radius n^(1/3) at a distance n. This radius is much 
       smaller than the walk's fluctuation size of O(sqrt(n)).
    4. For the walk to hit the target, its limiting ray must point in a direction that 
       allows the fluctuations to cover the target disk.
    5. A quantitative analysis shows that the probability p_n of this event decreases with n. 
       The probability can be estimated to be of the order O(n^(-5/6)).
    6. As n approaches infinity, this probability tends to zero.

    The final equation is therefore lim_{n->inf} p_n = 0.
    The code will print the numbers and symbols forming this conclusion.
