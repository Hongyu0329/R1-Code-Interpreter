    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the symmetry factor for the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagram's Topology:** First, I'll deduce the structure of the Feynman diagram based on the description: two vertices and four field contractions (propagators). Assuming a standard theory like $\\phi^4$, each vertex has four legs. For two vertices to be connected by four propagators, all four propagators must run between the two vertices. This forms a \"figure-eight\" or \"spectacles\" vacuum diagram.\n2.  **Identify the Symmetries:** The symmetry factor, `S`, of a diagram is the number of ways its internal components (vertices and lines) can be permuted without changing the diagram's overall structure. I will identify two main sources of symmetry for this diagram:\n    *   **Vertex Permutation:** The two vertices come from the same interaction term in the Lagrangian, making them identical. I'll check if they can be swapped.\n    *   **Propagator Permutation:** The four propagators connect the same pair of vertices, making them structurally equivalent. I'll determine how many ways these can be interchanged.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor is the product of the number of possible permutations for each type of symmetry. I will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n4.  **Final Output:** The script will print a step-by-step explanation of the calculation and the final equation with all the numerical values, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the characteristics of the diagram\n    num_interchangeable_vertices = 2\n    num_interchangeable_propagators = 4\n\n    # Calculate the symmetry factor from permuting the identical vertices.\n    # Since there are 2 vertices, they can be swapped.
