    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a weighted homogeneous polynomial `f` with weights `w` is given by the formula:\n    `c(f) = (d - Σwᵢ) / d`\n    where `d` is the weighted degree of the polynomial and `Σwᵢ` is the sum of the weights.\n\n2.  **Determine the Weighted Degree (d):** A polynomial is weighted homogeneous if every term (monomial) has the same weighted degree. The weighted degree of a term like $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}...z_n^{a_n}$ is calculated as $a_1w_1 + a_2w_2 + ... + a_nw_n$. I will calculate this for each term of your polynomial to find the common degree `d`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Sum of Weights (Σwᵢ):** I will sum the given weights: `22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75`.\n\n4.  **Compute the Invariant:** Finally, I will plug the values of `d` and `Σwᵢ` into the formula to find the invariant. A key property of a Calabi-Yau manifold defined this way is that `d` equals `Σwᵢ`, which implies the invariant should be 0. Let's verify this.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the final equation with all the numbers, as you requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Weights for the variables (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The polynomial is f = z1^8*z3 + z1^4*z2^3*z3 + z1*z2^7 + z1*z2*z3*z4*z5 + z2*z3^4 + z4^3*z5 + z5^3\n    # We represent each term by the tuple of its exponents.\n    exponents = [\n        (8, 0, 1, 0, 0),  # z1^8*z3\n        (4, 3, 1, 0, 0),  # z1^4*z2^3*z3\n        (1, 7, 0, 0, 0),  # z1*z2^7\n        (1, 1, 1, 1, 1),  # z1*z2*z3*z4*z5\n        (0, 1, 4, 0, 0),  # z2*z3^4\n        (0, 0, 0, 3, 1),  # z4^3*z5\n        (0, 0, 0, 0, 3)   # z5^3\n    ]\n\n    # Calculate the weighted degree for each term\n    term_degrees = []\n    for exp in exponents:\n        degree = sum(e * w for e, w in zip(exp, weights))\n        term_degrees.append(degree)\n\n    # For a weighted homogeneous polynomial, all term degrees must be equal.\n    # We check this and find the polynomial's degree 'd'.\n    degree_counts = Counter(term_degrees)\n    if len(degree_counts) > 1:\n        # This indicates a potential typo in the polynomial, as most terms\n        # for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface have the same weighted degree.\n        # We proceed with the most frequent degree.\n        print(f\"Warning: The polynomial is not perfectly weighted-homogeneous.
