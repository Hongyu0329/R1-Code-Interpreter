# Based on the analysis, the problem is interpreted as an instance
# of CLIFF_d with a constant integer width d. The runtime exponent c
# is then given by ceil(d - 0.5).
# A common choice for a simple, non-trivial cliff problem is d=2.
# We will use this value for our calculation.

d = 2.0

# The exponent c is ceil(d - 0.5)
c = math.ceil(d - 0.5)

# Rounding to three significant digits as requested
