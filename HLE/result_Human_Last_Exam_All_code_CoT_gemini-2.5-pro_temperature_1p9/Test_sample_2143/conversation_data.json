    "Based on the clues provided, I will deduce the identity of the person referred to as \"HE\".\n\nHere is my thinking process:\n1.  The core of the puzzle lies in interpreting the phrases \"issue of another's material possessions,\" \"at the end of HIS work,\" and \"prohibition against representation.\"\n2.  The \"prohibition against representation\" is a clear reference to the Second Commandment in the Abrahamic traditions, which forbids the making of graven images or idols.\n3.  The \"issue of another's material possessions\" at the \"end of HIS work\" points directly to the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This commandment is the last of the Decalogue.\n4.  The work being referenced is, therefore, the Ten Commandments (or the Decalogue).\n5.  Veronika Campan is a psychoanalyst working in the school of Jacques Lacan. Lacan famously analyzed the Ten Commandments in his work, particularly *Seminar VII: The Ethics of Psychoanalysis*. The interpretation described in the prompt, which contrasts the prohibition on desire (coveting the thing itself) with the prohibition on images (representation), is a hallmark of this psychoanalytic reading.\n6.  The person (\"HE\") who, according to the tradition, delivered this work (the Ten Commandments) from God to the people is the prophet **Moses**. He is the central lawgiver in the Torah.\n\nI will now provide a simple python script that constructs the name \"Moses\" in an equation format as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script constructs the requested name using its characters\n# to form an equation as per the user's instructions.\n\n# Define each character of the name as a term in the equation.\nchar1 = \"M\"\nchar2 = \"o\"\nchar3 = \"s\"\nchar4 = \"e\"\nchar5 = \"s\"\n\n# Combine the characters to form the final name.\nfull_name = char1 + char2 + char3 + char4 + char5\n\n# Print the final result in an equation format, showing each component.\nprint(f\"{char1} + {char2} + {char3} + {char4} + {char5} = {full_name}\")\n```\n<<<Moses>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
