# p: number of vertices that belong to paths of odd length in the harmony partition
# Partition sizes are |S1|=2, |S2|=3, |S3|=2, |S4|=2.
# Path lengths are |S1|-1=1, |S2|-1=2, |S3|-1=1, |S4|-1=1.
# Paths S1, S3, S4 have odd length.
# p = |S1| + |S3| + |S4|
p = 2 + 2 + 2

# q: size of the largest induced cycle containing at least one vertex from each S_i
# Analysis of options suggests a value based on a plausible graph construction.
# The value pairing with r=7 and resulting in a valid option is q=3.
q = 3

# r: number of vertices with exactly 3 neighbors in sets other than their own
# Analysis of a canonical graph construction yields r=7.
