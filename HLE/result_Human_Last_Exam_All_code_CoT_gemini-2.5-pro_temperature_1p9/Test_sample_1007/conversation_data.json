    "To solve this problem, I will analyze the starting and ending leg positions for each ballet step provided in the answer choices. I will create a small knowledge base in Python to store this information and then programmatically determine which step ends in the same position it begins.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Create a dictionary where each key is a ballet step and its value is another dictionary containing a description and a boolean indicating if the start and end positions are the same.\n2.  Iterate through this dictionary.\n3.  For each step, print its name and the analysis of its movement (whether it changes position or not).\n4.  Identify the step that ends in the same position it started.\n5.  Print the name of the correct step as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_step_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    ballet_steps = {\n        'A.
