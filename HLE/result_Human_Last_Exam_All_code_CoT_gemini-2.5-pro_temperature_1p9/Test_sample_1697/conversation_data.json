    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents**: The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. The first step uses sec-BuLi and TMEDA, which is a classic reagent system for directed *ortho*-metalation (DoM). The second step uses methyl iodide (CH3I), an electrophile.\n2.  **Step 1: Directed *ortho*-metalation**:\n    *   The starting molecule has two directing groups on the benzene ring: the amide group (-CONEt₂) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3.\n    *   Both groups are strong directing groups for *ortho*-lithiation. The amide group directs the strong base (sec-BuLi) to deprotonate one of its adjacent (*ortho*) positions (C2 or C6). The dimethylamino group directs to its *ortho* positions (C2 or C4).\n    *   Since both groups direct deprotonation to the C2 position, this position is doubly activated. The sec-BuLi will selectively remove the proton from C2, forming an aryllithium intermediate.\n3.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**:\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate formed in step 1 is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   It reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   The carbanion at C2 attacks the methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion.\n4.  **Final Product**: A methyl group (-CH₃) is added to the C2 position of the original benzamide. The final product is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to define the reaction components and print a step-by-step explanation, concluding with the name and chemical formula of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a two-step organic synthesis and determines the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define reactants and reagents\n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    starting_material_formula = \"C13H20N2O\"\n    \n    reagent_step1 = \"sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium) and TMEDA (Tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF\"\n    reagent_step2 = \"CH3I (Methyl Iodide)\"\n\n    print(\"--- Reaction Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Starting Material: {starting_material} ({starting_material_formula})\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Directed ortho-metalation\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Reaction with \" + reagent_step1)\n    print(\"This is a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) reaction.\")\n    print(\"The starting molecule has two directing groups on the benzene ring:\")\n    print(\"  1.
