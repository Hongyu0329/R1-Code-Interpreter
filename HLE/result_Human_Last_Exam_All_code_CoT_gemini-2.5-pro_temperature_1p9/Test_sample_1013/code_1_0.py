    explanation = """
The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of an antichain of nonprincipal ultrafilters on the natural numbers, all of whom are below a fixed ultrafilter V in the Rudin-Frolik order. Let's denote this order by <=.

1.  The Rudin-Frolik order is defined as U <= V if there exists a nondecreasing, finite-to-one function f from N to N such that U is the image of V under f (written U = f(V)).

2.  The question is to find the maximum possible value of the cardinality of an antichain within the set {U | U <= V}, where the maximum is taken over all possible choices of the nonprincipal ultrafilter V.

3.  This cardinality depends on the properties of V, specifically whether V is minimal in the Rudin-Frolik order.

4.  Case 1: V is a minimal ultrafilter.
    By a known theorem in set theory, if V is minimal, the set of all ultrafilters U such that U <= V is a countable set. Thus, for a minimal V, any antichain must also be countable.

5.  Case 2: V is not a minimal ultrafilter.
    The existence of such non-minimal ultrafilters is a fact provable in ZFC. For such an ultrafilter, a key theorem by Balcar and Simon shows that there exists an antichain of cardinality c (the cardinality of the continuum) within the set of predecessors {U | U <= V}.

6.  Conclusion:
    The question asks for the 'largest possible' cardinality. Since we can choose V to be non-minimal, we can achieve an antichain of size c. The number of functions that can generate predecessors is c, so the cardinality cannot exceed c. Therefore, the maximum possible cardinality is c.

The cardinality of the continuum is given by the equation: c = 2^aleph_0.
(Here, aleph_0 is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers).
