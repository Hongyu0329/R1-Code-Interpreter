    Solves the mathematical problem about cardinalities.

    The problem asks for the minimum value of X_f, where X_f is the
    cardinality of the set of functions g such that f is bounded by g_bar.
    Let kappa be an infinite cardinal.
    - f: kappa^+ x kappa^+ -> kappa
    - g: kappa^+ -> kappa
    - g_bar(alpha, beta) = max(g(alpha), g(beta))
    - The condition is f(alpha, beta) <= max(g(alpha), g(beta)) for all alpha, beta < kappa^+.
    - X_f = |{g | the condition holds}|

    Let's analyze the problem.

    1. For any given f, let S_f be the set of functions g that satisfy the condition.
       If g is in S_f, and g' is another function such that g'(x) >= g(x) for all x,
       then max(g'(alpha), g'(beta)) >= max(g(alpha), g(beta)).
       This means f(alpha, beta) <= max(g'(alpha), g'(beta)), so g' is also in S_f.
       This means S_f is an "upward-closed" set.

    2. If S_f is not empty, let g_0 be one of its elements. Then every function g
       such that g >= g_0 must also be in S_f.
       Let's find the number of such functions g. For each alpha < kappa^+, we must choose
       g(alpha) such that g(alpha) >= g_0(alpha) and g(alpha) < kappa.
       The number of choices for g(alpha) is the cardinality of the set of ordinals
       between g_0(alpha) and kappa, which is |kappa - g_0(alpha)|.

    3. Since kappa is an infinite cardinal, it is also a limit ordinal. This means
       for any ordinal delta < kappa, the cardinality of the set of ordinals between
       delta and kappa is exactly kappa.
       So, for each alpha, the number of choices for g(alpha) is kappa.

    4. The total number of such functions g >= g_0 is the product of the number of choices
       for each alpha in kappa^+. This is kappa multiplied by itself kappa^+ times.
       The result is kappa**(kappa^+).

    5. This means that if the set of solutions S_f is not empty, its cardinality X_f must be at least
       kappa**(kappa^+). The total number of functions g from kappa^+ to kappa is also
       kappa**(kappa^+), so if S_f is non-empty, its cardinality must be exactly kappa**(kappa^+).

    6. We must check if a non-empty S_f always exists. Let's consider the simplest
       function f, the one that is constantly 0.
       f(alpha, beta) = 0 for all alpha, beta.
       The condition becomes 0 <= max(g(alpha), g(beta)). This is true for any function g
       since the codomain kappa contains only non-negative ordinals.
       For this choice of f, S_f is the set of all possible functions g, so X_f = kappa**(kappa^+).

    7. Since we have found a function f for which X_f = kappa**(kappa^+), and we've shown
       that any non-empty set of solutions must have this cardinality, the minimum non-zero
       value for X_f is kappa**(kappa^+).

    8. Using cardinal arithmetic, we can simplify this expression:
       kappa**(kappa^+) = (2**kappa)**(kappa^+) = 2**(kappa * kappa^+) = 2**(kappa^+).
       Both expressions are equivalent. Let's print the latter.
