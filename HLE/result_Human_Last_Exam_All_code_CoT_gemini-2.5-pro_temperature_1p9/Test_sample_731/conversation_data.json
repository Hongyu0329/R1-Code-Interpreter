    "To determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps:\n\n### **Plan**\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In the general form $SD_{2^n}$, its size is $2^n$. Therefore, for size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which gives $n = 9$. The group is $SD_{2^9}$.\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup that can be expressed as $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$.\n3.  **Use a Known Theorem:** For any finite $p$-group (a group whose order is a power of a prime $p$), the set of all its power subgroups is precisely the set $\\{ G^{p^i} \\mid i \\ge 0 \\}$. Since the order of our group is $512 = 2^9$, it is a 2-group (where $p=2$). Therefore, we only need to compute and count the distinct subgroups in the sequence $G^{2^0}, G^{2^1}, G^{2^2}, \\dots$\n4.  **Calculate the Subgroups:**\n    *   For $i=0$, we have $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$, the group itself. This is our first power subgroup.\n    *   The semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ is generated by two elements, $r$ and $s$, with relations $r^{2^{n-1}}=s^2=1$ and $srs=r^{2^{n-2}-1}$. For $n=9$, this is $r^{256}=s^2=1$ and $srs=r^{127}$.\n    *   It can be shown that for $i \\ge 1$, the power subgroup $G^{2^i}$ is a cyclic subgroup generated by a power of $r$. Specifically, $G^{2^i} = \\langle r^{2^i} \\rangle$.\n    *   We need to find how many unique subgroups this formula generates for $n=9$. The sequence of subgroups is:\n        *   $i=1: G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n        *   $i=2: G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n        *   ...\n        *   $i=8: G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n    *   For $i \\ge 8$, the subgroups will remain the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$.\n5.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups:**\n    *   We have the group $G$ itself.\n    *   We have the cyclic subgroups $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle$. These are 8 distinct subgroups, as each has a different size.\n    *   The total count is $1$ (for $G$) plus $8$ (for the proper subgroups), which gives 9. In general, for $SD_{2^n}$, the number of power subgroups is $n$.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script can be written to formalize this calculation. The script will determine $n$ from the group size and calculate the total count based on the formula derived: `1 + (n-1)`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the answer based on this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_of_semidihedral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in a semidihedral group of a given size.\n\n    The number of power subgroups for the semidihedral group SD_2^n is n.\n    This script finds n from the group size and outputs the total count.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # A semidihedral group has size 2^n. We find n for the given size.\n    # 2^n = 512\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # The power subgroups of SD_2^n are G itself, and the n-1 cyclic subgroups\n    # <r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^(2^(n-1))>. The last one is the trivial group {1}.\n    # This gives a total of 1 + (n-1) = n subgroups.\n\n    num_proper_subgroups = n - 1\n    total_subgroups = 1 + num_proper_subgroups\n\n    print(f\"For the semidihedral group of size {group_size}, n is {n}.\")\n    print(\"The number of power subgroups is equal to n.\")\n    print(\"This is composed of the group G itself, plus n-1 other distinct subgroups.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    # The final required equation output\n    print(f\"1 + ({n} - 1) = {total_subgroups}\")\n\ncount_power_subgroups_of_semidihedral()\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
