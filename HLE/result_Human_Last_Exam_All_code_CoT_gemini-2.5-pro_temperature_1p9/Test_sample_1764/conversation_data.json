    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution, which will be implemented in the final Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between embeddings and the Banach space structure:** Let $f: X \\to B$ be an isometric embedding. For any vector $v \\in B$, we can define a new map $f_v: X \\to B$ by $f_v(x) = f(x) + v$. This new map is also an isometric embedding because the distance in a Banach space is translation-invariant:\n    $d_B(f_v(x_1), f_v(x_2)) = \\|f_v(x_1) - f_v(x_2)\\| = \\|(f(x_1)+v) - (f(x_2)+v)\\| = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n    If $v_1 \\neq v_2$, then $f_{v_1}$ and $f_{v_2}$ are distinct maps. This means that if at least one embedding exists, the total number of embeddings is at least the cardinality of the Banach space, $K$. So, the number of embeddings $N \\ge K$.\n\n2.  **Find the minimum possible cardinality K:** A Banach space, being a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, can either be the trivial space $\\{0\\}$ or it must be an infinite set.\n    *   **Case 1: The trivial Banach space.** Let $B = \\{0\\}$. Its cardinality is $K=1$. It is a valid Banach space.\n    *   **Case 2: A non-trivial Banach space.** If $B \\neq \\{0\\}$, its cardinality $K$ is infinite (at least the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$).\n\n3.  **Find the minimum number of embeddings:**\n    *   In **Case 2**, if an embedding exists, the number of embeddings is at least $K$, which is infinite.\n    *   In **Case 1**, we have $B=\\{0\\}$ with $K=1$. To find an isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$, the condition $d_X(x_1, x_2) = d_B(f(x_1), f(x_2)) = d_B(0, 0) = 0$ must hold for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$. This is only possible if $X$ is a single-point space, e.g., $X=\\{p_1\\}$. A single-point space is a finite ultrametric space. For this specific $X$ and $B$, there is exactly one map, $f(p_1) = 0$, which is an isometric embedding.\n    *   Therefore, the number of embeddings in this scenario is exactly 1.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** We have found a valid scenario (a single-point space $X$ and the zero Banach space $B$) where the number of isometric embeddings is 1. In all other cases where embeddings exist, the number is infinite. Thus, the smallest possible number of embeddings is 1. The python script will articulate this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by reasoning about the properties of Banach spaces and isometric embeddings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Problem: Let X be a finite ultrametric space and B a Banach space of cardinality K.\")\n    print(\"What is the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of X in B?\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Derivation ---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Relate the number of embeddings (N) to the cardinality of the Banach space (K).\n    print(\"1.
