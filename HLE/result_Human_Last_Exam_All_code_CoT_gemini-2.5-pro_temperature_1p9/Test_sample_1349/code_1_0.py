# The complex number c is defined from the differential equation da/dt = (i-1/2)a + f
# So, c = i - 1/2
c_real = -0.5
c_imag = 1.0
c = complex(c_real, c_imag)

# As derived in the reasoning, the value of X simplifies to 1 + Re(1/c)
# We perform this calculation step-by-step.

# 1. Calculate the inverse of c
inv_c = 1 / c

# 2. Find the real part of the inverse of c
re_inv_c = inv_c.real

# 3. Calculate the final value of X
X_supremum = 1 + re_inv_c
