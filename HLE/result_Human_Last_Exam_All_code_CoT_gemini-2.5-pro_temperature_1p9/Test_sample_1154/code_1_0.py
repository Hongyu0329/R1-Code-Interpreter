def calculate_ram_test_time():
    """
    Calculates the time required to test a RAM with the March RAW algorithm.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1.  Identifies March RAW as the test with the highest fault coverage from the list.
        It has a complexity of 12N, meaning 12 operations per bit.
    2.  Sets the parameters:
        - RAM size (N) = 1,000,000 bits
        - Cycle time per operation (tc) = 5 ns
    3.  Calculates the total test time in nanoseconds.
    4.  Converts the result to milliseconds and prints the final equation and answer.
