    This function calculates the spatial average of the system's state u

    The plan is based on the insight that the problem simplifies significantly.
    The complex PDE likely has a stationary solution on the manifold z = -y,
    meaning u(x,y,-y,t) = u(x,y,-y,0).
    Thus, the integral at t=1 is the same as at t=0.

    We calculate the integral of the initial condition u(x,y,-y,0):
