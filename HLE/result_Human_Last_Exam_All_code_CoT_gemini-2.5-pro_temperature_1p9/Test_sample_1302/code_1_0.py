    # 4-(5,7-dihydroxybenzofuran-2-yl)benzene-1,3-diol, modified to C15H10O5 via an ether linkage creating a new ring.

    # Structure name: 3,5-dihydroxy-2-(5-hydroxy-2-methoxy-phenyl)-benzofuran - No this is C21...

    # Final proposed structure: An isomer of the Aurone 'maritimetin', but with the carbonyl removed and aromaticity restored.
