    "An involution is an element of a group that is its own inverse and is not the identity element. In other words, for an element `x`, it must satisfy `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`. Our task is to find the number of such elements in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997).\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Define the group:** The group in question is PSU(n, q), where n=4 and q=997. This group is the quotient group `SU(n, q) / Z`, where `G = SU(n, q)` is the special unitary group and `Z = Z(G)` is its center.\n2.  **Relate involutions in PSU to elements in SU:** An element `h = gZ` in `PSU(n, q)` is an involution if `h^2 = 1` and `h ≠ 1`. In terms of the parent group `SU(n, q)`, this means we are looking for elements `g` such that `g^2 \\in Z` but `g \\notin Z`.\n3.  **Determine the center Z:** The center `Z` of `SU(n, q)` consists of scalar matrices `cI` where `c^n=1` and `c^{q+1}=1`. For `n=4` and `q=997`, we need `c^4=1` and `c^{998}=1`. The only solutions for `c` are `1` and `-1`. So, `Z = \\{I, -I\\}`.\n4.  **Analyze the condition `g^2 \\in Z`:** This means `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n    *   The condition `g^2 = -I` implies the eigenvalues of `g` are `i` or `-i`. For `g` to be in a unitary group `U(n,q)`, its eigenvalues `λ` must satisfy `λ^{q+1}=1`. For `q=997`, we have `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`. This leads to `i^{q+1} = i^{998} = (i^2)^{499} = (-1)^{499} = -1`, which is not equal to 1. Therefore, there are no elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = -I`.\n    *   This leaves us with the condition `g^2 = I`. We also require `g \\notin Z`, which means `g \\neq I` and `g \\neq -I`.\n5.  **Count the relevant elements in SU(4, q):** The elements `g` in `SU(4, q)` with `g^2=I` are classified by their conjugacy classes. For `n=4` and `q` odd, the classes are represented by `I`, `-I`, and `diag(1, 1, -1, -1)`. Since we need `g \\notin Z`, we only consider the conjugacy class of `diag(1, 1, -1, -1)`.\n6.  **Calculate the size of the conjugacy class:** The number of elements in this class, denoted `N_c`, is given by the formula:\n    `N_c = |U(4,q)| / |U(2,q)|^2 = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`.\n7.  **Calculate the number of involutions in PSU(4, q):** The `N_c` elements found in the previous step are the pre-images of the involutions in `PSU(4, q)`. Since the center `Z` has size 2, these elements are partitioned into cosets of size 2. Thus, the number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `N_c / 2`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this final formula to calculate the number for `q=997`.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n    The number of involutions in PSU(n, q) for n=4 and q = 1 (mod 4) is given by\n    the formula: (q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # Calculate the components of the formula\n    term1 = q**4\n    term2 = q**2 - q + 1\n    term3 = q**2 + 1\n\n    # Calculate the numerator of the formula\n    numerator = term1 * term2 * term3\n\n    # The denominator is the size of the center of SU(4,q)\n    denominator = 2\n\n    # The result is the number of involutions\n    result = numerator // denominator\n\n    print(f\"To find the number of involutions in PSU(4, {q}), we use the formula:\")\n    print(f\"(q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2\\n\")\n    print(f\"For q = {q}:\")\n    print(f\"The first term, q^4, is: {term1}\")\n    print(f\"The second term, q^2 - q + 1, is: {term2}\")\n    print(f\"The third term, q^2 + 1, is: {term3}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe full numerator is the product of these terms:\")\n    print(f\"Numerator = {term1} * {term2} * {term3} = {numerator}\")\n    print(f\"The denominator is: {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe final result is:\")\n    print(f\"Number of involutions = {numerator} // {denominator} = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<482677838525697361507765>>>"
