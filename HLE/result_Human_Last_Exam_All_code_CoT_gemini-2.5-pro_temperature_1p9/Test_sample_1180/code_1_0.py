# The problem is about finding the thickness of a double point in the stable reduction of a curve.
# This is a theoretical problem from arithmetic geometry. The solution involves a sequence of transformations of the curve equation to find a stable model, and then calculating an invariant of that model.

# 1. The curve is given by z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.
# 2. We work over a 2-adic field with valuation v(2)=1.
# 3. We perform changes of variables to find a model whose special fiber is a stable curve.
#    z_1 = z - 1 gives z_1^2 + 2*z_1 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3.
#    To resolve the reduction, we work in an extension field Q_2(sqrt(2)). Let pi = sqrt(2). v_pi(pi) = 1, v_pi(2)=2.
#    Let z_1 = pi*w = sqrt(2)*w.
#    (sqrt(2)*w)^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*w = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3
#    2*w^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*w = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3
#    w^2 + sqrt(2)*w = x^5 + x^3
# 4. We make a final substitution to separate the components of the special fiber.
#    Let w = sqrt(2)*Z and x = sqrt(2)*X.
#    (sqrt(2)*Z)^2 + sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)*Z) = (sqrt(2)*X)^5 + (sqrt(2)*X)^3
#    2*Z^2 + 2*Z = 4*sqrt(2)*X^5 + 2*sqrt(2)*X^3
#    Z^2 + Z = 2*sqrt(2)*X^5 + sqrt(2)*X^3
#    Z*(Z+1) = sqrt(2) * (2*X^5 + X^3)
# 5. The reduction of this model mod pi=sqrt(2) is Z*(Z+1) = 0.
#    This represents two components, Z=0 and Z=1.
# 6. The term connecting these components is sqrt(2)*(2*X^5+X^3).
#    The thickness of the node(s) connecting the components is the valuation of this term.
#    The valuation is determined by the power of the uniformizer pi = sqrt(2).
#    The term is (sqrt(2))^1 * (unit).
#    The thickness is the exponent, which is 1.
