    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stable reduction of the curve and compute the thickness of the double point.\n\n**1. Analyze the Curve and Initial Reduction**\n\nThe curve is given by the affine equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\nWe are working over a 2-adic field, so let's consider the prime $p=2$. The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\nLet's find the reduction of the curve modulo 2. The equation becomes:\n$z^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x^5 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + 1 \\pmod 2$\n$z^2 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\nThe special fiber of this model is a \"double line\" $z=1$ over the affine line $\\mathbb{A}^1_{\\mathbb{F}_2}$. This is a non-reduced scheme, so the model is not stable. We need to perform transformations to find a stable model.\n\n**2. Change of Variables to Improve the Model**\n\nTo resolve the non-reduced structure, we can make a change of variables. Let's recenter the model around the special fiber. Let $z_1 = z-1$.\n$(z_1+1)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$z_1^2 + 2z_1 + 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$z_1^2 + 2z_1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\n$z_1(z_1+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nThis equation still gives a singular reduction modulo 2. Let's try to make the model regular by introducing a minimal amount of ramification. We need to \"divide by 2\" to separate the components, which suggests passing to an extension field where $2$ has a square root.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt{2})$. The ring of integers is $O_K = \\mathbb{Z}_2[\\sqrt{2}]$. Let $\\pi = \\sqrt{2}$ be the uniformizer. We have a new valuation $v_\\pi$ normalized by $v_\\pi(\\pi)=1$, and $v_\\pi(2) = v_\\pi(\\pi^2) = 2$.\nLet's change variables $z_1 = \\pi w = \\sqrt{2} w$. Substituting into the previous equation:\n$(\\sqrt{2}w)^2 + 2(\\sqrt{2}w) = 2x^5+2x^3$\n$2w^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}w = 2x^5+2x^3$\nDividing the entire equation by 2, we get a new model:\n$w^2 + \\sqrt{2}w = x^5+x^3$\n\n**3. Analyze the New Model's Reduction**\n\nLet's analyze the reduction of this new model modulo the uniformizer $\\pi = \\sqrt{2}$. The residue field is still $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$w^2 \\equiv x^5+x^3 \\pmod{\\sqrt{2}}$\n$w^2 \\equiv x^3(x^2+1) \\pmod{\\sqrt{2}}$\nSince we are in $\\mathbb{F}_2$, $x^2+1 = (x+1)^2$.\n$w^2 = x^3(x+1)^2$\nThis curve in the special fiber is a reducible curve with singularities. It has a cusp at $x=0$ and a node at $x=1$. A stable curve can only have nodes, so we need to resolve the cusp. This is a standard step in finding the stable reduction. The process involves blowing up the singular point $(x,w)=(0,0)$.\n\nThe important structure for determining thickness is often revealed before carrying out the full sequence of blow-ups. Consider another transformation on the equation $w^2 + \\sqrt{2}w = x^5+x^3$.\nLet's complete the square for $w$:\n$(w + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 - (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = x^5+x^3$\n$(w + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 - \\frac{2}{4} = x^5+x^3$\n$(w + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 = x^5+x^3 + \\frac{1}{2}$\nLet $W = w + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The equation is $W^2 = x^5+x^3+\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThis is a standard form of a hyperelliptic curve.\n\nHowever, a more direct path exists. Let's write the equation as:\n$w(w+\\sqrt{2}) = x^3(x^2+1)$.\nThe reduction modulo $\\sqrt{2}$ is $w^2 = x^3(x+1)^2$.\nLet's make one more transformation to separate the components that appear in the reduction. Let $x=\\sqrt{2}X$.\n$w^2 + \\sqrt{2}w = (\\sqrt{2}X)^5 + (\\sqrt{2}X)^3$\n$w^2 + \\sqrt{2}w = 4\\sqrt{2}X^5 + 2\\sqrt{2}X^3$\n$w^2 + \\sqrt{2}w = \\sqrt{2}(4X^5 + 2X^3)$\nLet's try scaling $w$ as well. Let $w=\\sqrt{2}Z$.\n$(\\sqrt{2}Z)^2 + \\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2}Z) = \\sqrt{2}(4X^5+2X^3)$\n$2Z^2 + 2Z = \\sqrt{2}(4X^5+2X^3)$\n$Z(Z+1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} (4X^5+2X^3) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(4X^5+2X^3) = \\sqrt{2}(2X^5+X^3)$\nSo we have the equation $Z^2+Z = \\sqrt{2}(2X^5+X^3)$.\n\nLet's reduce this equation modulo $\\pi=\\sqrt{2}$.\n$Z^2+Z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\sqrt{2}}$\n$Z(Z+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{\\sqrt{2}}$\nThe special fiber of this model consists of two disjoint components over the $X$-line: the line $Z=0$ and the line $Z=1$.\nThe original curve, in the generic fiber, provides a \"bridge\" between these two components. The term that connects them is the right-hand side, $\\sqrt{2}(2X^5+X^3)$.\nThe thickness of the double point(s) formed in the stable reduction that connects these components is given by the valuation of the connecting term.\nThe thickness $\\delta$ is the exponent of the uniformizer in the term that connects the components. In our case, the term is $\\pi^1 \\cdot (\\text{unit})$.\nThe valuation is $v_\\pi(\\sqrt{2}(2X^5+X^3))=v_\\pi(\\sqrt{2})=1$.\n\nThe double point (which is actually a cycle of two double points in the final stable reduction) has a thickness that corresponds to how \"far apart\" the components are in the special fiber. This \"distance\" is measured by the valuation of the term linking them.\n\nThus, the thickness is 1.\n\n```python\n# The problem is about finding the thickness of a double point in the stable reduction of a curve.\n# This is a theoretical problem from arithmetic geometry.
