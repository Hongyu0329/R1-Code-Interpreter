# Step 1: Analyze Question 1: "What animal's coat color changed as a baby?"
# Document 1 states the change happened "at a few months old".
# Document 2 states the change happened "As they reached puberty".
# The term "baby" is more accurately described by "a few months old" than "puberty".
# Therefore, Document 1 is the more relevant choice for Question 1.
q1_choice = 1

# Step 2: Analyze Question 2: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
# Both documents contain the identical and relevant sentence: "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour."
# However, the context for the question is the "baby" stage. Document 1 provides a
# more specific and fitting timeframe ("a few months old"), making it the better overall
# document for questions related to this life stage.
# Therefore, Document 1 is also the more relevant choice for Question 2.
q2_choice = 1

# Step 3: Combine the choices and present the final answer.
# The choice for Question 1 is 1. The choice for Question 2 is 1.
print("Chosen document for Question 1: {}".format(q1_choice))

# The final answer format is "Q1 choice - Q2 choice".
print("The final ranking is: {}-{}".format(q1_choice, q2_choice))
