Statement D is incorrect. Let's break down why:

1.  **Non-Uniform Quantization vs. GPU Hardware:** Non-uniform quantization maps floating-point numbers to a set of non-evenly spaced values. This is typically implemented using a codebook where low-bit indices point to float values.

2.  **Hardware Acceleration (Tensor Cores):** Modern NVIDIA GPUs (like Ampere) achieve massive speed-ups for matrix multiplication using specialized hardware called Tensor Cores. These cores are designed to operate on specific, regular data formats like FP16, BF16, or uniform INT8/INT4 integers. They cannot directly process non-uniform data (i.e., codebook indices).

3.  **Computational Overhead:** To use non-uniformly quantized weights in a matrix multiplication, the GPU kernel would have to:
    a. Load the low-bit indices representing the weights.
    b. For each index, perform a table lookup to fetch the actual float value from the codebook.
    c. Perform the multiplication with the activation.
    This on-the-fly lookup process is computationally very expensive. It introduces indirect memory access and complex logic that prevents the use of Tensor Cores and is much slower than the simple, direct arithmetic performed by them.

4.  **The Flawed Comparison:** The statement compares this slow, lookup-based method to FP16. However, FP16 matrix multiplication is *also* heavily accelerated by Tensor Cores on Ampere GPUs.

5.  **Conclusion:** While non-uniform quantization saves memory bandwidth by storing weights in fewer bits, the resulting computational inefficiency is so large that it would lead to a significant *slowdown* compared to the highly optimized FP16 Tensor Core pipeline. Therefore, the claim of achieving "substantial inference runtime speed-up" is false.
