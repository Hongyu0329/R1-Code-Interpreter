    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Define Rule 110**: The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and its left and right neighbors. The rule can be represented as a mapping from the 8 possible 3-cell binary patterns to the next state of the central cell. In binary, Rule 110 is `01101110`.\n2.  **Initialize the Automaton**: We will create a 1D list or array to represent the cells. The size of this list must be large enough to contain the pattern after 20 iterations. A safe width would be `(2 * number of iterations) + a bit of padding`. The initial state will be a list of zeros with a single `1` in the center.\n3.  **Run the Simulation**: We'll loop 20 times. In each iteration, we'll calculate the next state of every cell based on its neighborhood and Rule 110, storing the results in a new list. After calculating all new states, this new list becomes the current state for the next iteration. We assume cells outside our list are always 0 (a fixed boundary condition).\n4.  **Format and Print the Final Result**: After 20 iterations, the list will contain the final pattern. We will convert this list of integers into a single binary string and print it.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton for 20 generations\n    starting from a single '1' and prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define parameters for the simulation\n    iterations = 20\n    # The width of the grid should be large enough to prevent edge effects.\n    # The pattern grows by at most 1 cell on each side per iteration.\n    width = 2 * iterations + 41 # A safe width\n\n    # The mapping for Rule 110.
