    "Based on neuroanatomical studies of cephalopods, particularly the cuttlefish, the brain is a highly complex structure. The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the posterior subesophageal mass, which controls many visceral functions.\n\nMy plan is to first identify the specific brain lobes located posterior to the palliovisceral lobe from established anatomical literature and diagrams. Then, I will write a simple Python script to print out the names of these regions as the answer, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the names of the brain regions situated\n    posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n    The information is based on cephalopod neuroanatomical data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is one of the most posterior lobes in the subesophageal mass.\n    # The lobes immediately posterior or posterodorsal to it are primarily:\n    # 1. The Posterior Chromatophore Lobes (involved in skin patterning)\n    # 2. The Posterior Basal Lobes (involved in motor control)\n    \n    adjacent_regions = [\n        \"Posterior chromatophore lobes\",\n        \"Posterior basal lobes\"\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"The brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    for region in adjacent_regions:\n        print(f\"- {region}\")\n\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the posterior basal lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
