    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic ways to define a category structure on 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Deconstruct the Category Structure:** A category with 2 objects, say `A` and `B`, has 4 sets of morphisms: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)`. Each object must have an identity morphism, so `id_A` is in `Hom(A,A)` and `id_B` is in `Hom(B,B)`. This means `|Hom(A,A)| >= 1` and `|Hom(B,B)| >= 1`.\n\n2.  **Partition the Morphisms:** We have 4 morphisms in total. Since 2 are identities, we are left with 2 \"non-identity\" morphisms to distribute among the four `Hom` sets. Let `n_XY = |Hom(X,Y)|`. The problem boils down to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to `(n_AA - 1) + n_AB + n_BA + (n_BB - 1) = 2`.\n\n3.  **Enumerate Partitions (up to isomorphism):** We list the possible distributions of the 4 morphisms into the four `Hom` sets, considering that swapping the object labels `A` and `B` results in an isomorphic category. This gives us 6 unique types of distributions to analyze.\n    *   `swap(A,B)` on `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)` results in `(n_BB, n_BA, n_AB, n_AA)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Case:** For each distribution, we determine how many non-isomorphic ways the composition operation can be defined while satisfying the category axioms (associativity and identity laws).\n\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The total count is the sum of the counts from each non-isomorphic distribution.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by enumerating each case and calculating the number of resulting categories.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n    The problem is broken down by considering the possible distributions of the 4\n    morphisms among the four Hom-sets: Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), Hom(B,B).\n    Let their sizes be n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB.\n    Since each object must have an identity morphism, n_AA >= 1 and n_BB >= 1.\n    The total number of morphisms is n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 4.\n\n    We analyze the non-isomorphic partitions of these morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_categories = 0\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing partitions (n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) of 4 morphisms for 2 objects A and B:\")\n    print(\"=================================================================================\\n\")\n\n    # Case 1: Partition (3, 0, 0, 1) and its isomorph (1, 0, 0, 3)\n    # The category is a disjoint union of two one-object categories (monoids).\n    # One monoid has 3 elements, the other has 1.\n    # The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 7.\n    # (Z_3 group, and 6 non-group monoids).\n    case1_count = 7\n    total_categories += case1_count\n    print(f\"Case 1: Partition (3, 0, 0, 1)\")\n    print(\"Represents a category that is a disjoint union of a 3-element monoid and a 1-element monoid.\")\n    print(\"The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 7.\")\n    print(f\"Number of categories in this class = {case1_count}\\n\")\n    \n    # Case 2: Partition (1, 2, 0, 1) and its isomorph (1, 0, 2, 1)\n    # Hom(A,A)={id_A}, Hom(A,B)={f,g}, Hom(B,A)={}, Hom(B,B)={id_B}.\n    # There are no non-trivial compositions to define.
