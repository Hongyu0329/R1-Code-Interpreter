    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.

    The problem is broken down by considering the possible distributions of the 4
    morphisms among the four Hom-sets: Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), Hom(B,B).
    Let their sizes be n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB.
    Since each object must have an identity morphism, n_AA >= 1 and n_BB >= 1.
    The total number of morphisms is n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 4.

    We analyze the non-isomorphic partitions of these morphisms.
