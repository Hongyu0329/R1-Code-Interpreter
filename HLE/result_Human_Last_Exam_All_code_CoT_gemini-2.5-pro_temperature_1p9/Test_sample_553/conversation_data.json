    "The specific chord progression of a tonic major chord (I) followed by a minor fifth/dominant chord (v) is very unusual in pop music.\n\nHowever, a famous Beatles song features a very similar and musically iconic progression at the start: a tonic major chord (I) followed by a minor fourth/subdominant chord (iv). It's highly likely this is the song you're thinking of.\n\nThe song is \"Michelle\". It's in the key of F major. The song begins with an F major chord (the tonic, I) on the word \"Michelle\", and then moves to a B-flat minor chord (the minor subdominant, iv) on the words \"ma belle\".\n\nThis Python script will print the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the Beatles song with the distinctive chord change at the beginning.\n    The user asked for a tonic to a minor fifth (I -> v).\n    The actual famous progression is a tonic to a minor fourth (I -> iv).\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major\"\n    unusual_chord = \"B-flat Minor\"\n    \n    progression_in_numerals = \"I -> iv\"\n    tonic_numeral = 1\n    unusual_chord_numeral = 4\n\n    print(f\"The song you are likely thinking of is '{song_title}' by The Beatles.\")\n    print(\"\\nWhile a jump from a tonic to a minor fifth (I -> v) is rare,\")\n    print(\"this song features a very famous and similar-sounding jump from a\")\n    print(\"tonic major chord to a minor fourth chord.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Here is the analysis:\")\n    print(f\"  - Key: {key}\")\n    print(f\"  - First chord (Tonic, I): {tonic_chord}\")\n    print(f\"  - Second chord (Minor Fourth, iv): {unusual_chord}\\n\")\n    \n    # Per the instruction: \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n    # The 'equation' here is the Roman numeral progression.\n    print(f\"The chord progression can be written with Roman numerals as:\")\n    print(f\"I -> iv\")\n    print(\"Breaking down the numerals from that progression:\")\n    print(f\"The first chord is number: {tonic_numeral}\")\n    print(f\"The second chord is number: {unusual_chord_numeral}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
