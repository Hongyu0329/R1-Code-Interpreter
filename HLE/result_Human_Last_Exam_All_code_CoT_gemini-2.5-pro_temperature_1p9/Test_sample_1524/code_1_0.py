    # Step 1: State the Bose-Einstein distribution.
    # The average occupation number <n_ε> of a boson state with energy ε is:
    # <n_ε> = 1 / (exp((ε - μ) / (k_B*T)) - 1)
    # where μ is the chemical potential, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.
    print("Step 1: The Bose-Einstein distribution formula implies a constraint.")
    print("The occupation number of a state with energy ε is <n_ε> = 1 / (exp((ε - μ) / (k_B*T)) - 1).")

    # Step 2: Identify the physical constraint.
    # For <n_ε> to be a positive number, the denominator must be positive.
    # exp((ε - μ) / (k_B*T)) - 1 > 0  =>  exp((ε - μ) / (k_B*T)) > 1
    # Taking the natural log of both sides: (ε - μ) / (k_B*T) > 0.
    # Since k_B and T are positive, this simplifies to: ε - μ > 0 or μ < ε.
    print("\nStep 2: Derive the general limit on the chemical potential μ.")
    print("For the occupation number to be positive, the denominator must be positive. This requires that μ < ε for all energy states ε.")

    # Step 3: Apply the constraint to the ground state.
    # This condition must hold for all energy levels, so it must hold for the lowest
    # energy level, the ground state energy ε_0.
    # Therefore, the most restrictive and fundamental limit is μ < ε_0.
    print("\nStep 3: Apply the limit to the ground state.")
    print("The most restrictive condition is set by the ground state (lowest energy ε_0). Therefore, the chemical potential must always be less than the ground state energy: μ < ε_0.")

    # Step 4: Explain the behavior during condensation.
    # BEC involves a macroscopic number of particles entering the ground state.
    # For the occupation <n_0> to be very large, its denominator must approach zero.
    # This happens when the chemical potential μ gets infinitesimally close to the ground state energy from below (μ → ε_0^-).
    # In the condensed phase (T <= T_critical), the chemical potential is effectively 'pinned' at this limiting value.
    print("\nStep 4: Analyze the condition during Bose-Einstein Condensation.")
    print("During condensation, a macroscopic number of particles occupies the ground state. This forces the chemical potential μ to become nearly equal to the ground state energy, μ ≈ ε_0.")

    # Step 5: Relate the limiting value ε_0 to a physical definition.
    # What is ε_0? The chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at absolute zero (T=0)
    # is precisely the ground state energy, because at T=0 all particles are in the ground state.
    # Therefore, the limit on μ during BEC is that it equals the chemical potential of a
    # non-interacting Bose gas at T=0. This corresponds to choice C.
    print("\nStep 5: Identify the physical meaning of the limit.")
    print("The ground state energy, ε_0, is precisely the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at absolute zero temperature (T=0).")
    print("Therefore, the limit on the chemical potential during condensation is that it is equal to the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature.")
