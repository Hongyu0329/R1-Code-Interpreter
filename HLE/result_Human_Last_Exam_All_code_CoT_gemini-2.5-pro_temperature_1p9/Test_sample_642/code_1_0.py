# The problem asks to compute the limit of f(k+1) - f(k) as k approaches infinity,
# where f(k) is the minimum number of states for a Turing machine to recognize
# the language L_k = {w in {0,1}* : number of 1s in w is a multiple of k}.

# Step 1: Model the state complexity f(k).
# The most state-efficient Turing Machine design involves using the tape to store
# the count of 1s in binary. The number of states is dominated by the need
# to encode the integer k in the machine's transition function so it can be
# used in a division algorithm on the tape.
# This requires a number of states proportional to the number of bits in k.
# So, f(k) is proportional to log2(k). Let's model f(k) = c * log2(k) + d.

# Step 2: Set up the limit calculation.
# We need to compute: lim_{k->inf} [f(k+1) - f(k)]
# This becomes: lim_{k->inf} [c*log2(k+1) - c*log2(k)]
# = c * lim_{k->inf} [log2(k+1) - log2(k)]
# = c * lim_{k->inf} [log2((k+1)/k)]
# = c * lim_{k->inf} [log2(1 + 1/k)]

# Step 3: Evaluate the limit.
# As k -> inf, 1/k -> 0.
# The limit becomes: c * log2(1 + 0) = c * log2(1) = c * 0 = 0.

# The final answer is 0.

# Let's demonstrate the terms in the final equation for a large k.
k = 1000000
# The equation inside the limit is log2((k+1)/k)
term_val = math.log2((k + 1) / k)

print("For a large k, e.g., k = {}, the equation log2((k+1)/k) becomes:".format(k))
print("log2(({} + 1) / {}) = log2({}) = {}".format(k, k, (k+1)/k, term_val))
print("As k approaches infinity, this value approaches log2(1) = 0.")
