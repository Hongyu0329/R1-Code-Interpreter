# The problem asks for the limit of f(n) / (n * log2(n)) as n -> infinity.
# Let's break down the calculation of this limit based on a known mathematical theorem.

# The function f(n) corresponds to a quantity N_p(n) in number theory, where p is a prime.
# For our problem, we are dealing with the 2-adic valuation (nu_2), so the prime p is 2.
p = 2

# A known result in number theory states that for any prime p:
# lim_{n->inf} N_p(n) / (n * log_p(n)) = (p - 1) / p
# The function f(n) is N_2(n), and the logarithm in the denominator is log base 2,
# which matches the theorem.

# We can now calculate the limit using this formula.
# First, calculate the numerator of the formula: p - 1
numerator = p - 1

# The denominator of the formula is just p.
denominator = p

# The value of the limit is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator.
limit_value = numerator / denominator
