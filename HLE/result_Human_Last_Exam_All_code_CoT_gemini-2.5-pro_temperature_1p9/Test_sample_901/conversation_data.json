    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an E2 elimination reaction on a substituted cyclohexane ring. The outcome is determined by stereochemistry.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and it's treated with potassium tert-butoxide, which is a strong, bulky base. This setup strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Recall E2 Stereochemistry:** The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed must be in an *anti-periplanar* arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both the leaving group and the proton must be in **axial** positions.\n3.  **Analyze the Conformations of the Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane. It can exist in two chair conformations: one with both the bromo and methyl groups in equatorial positions (diequatorial), and one with both groups in axial positions (diaxial). The diequatorial conformer is far more stable and is the major form at equilibrium.\n4.  **Determine the Reactive Conformer:** The E2 reaction cannot occur from the stable diequatorial conformer because the bromine is in an equatorial position. For the reaction to happen, the molecule must ring-flip into the less stable, but reactive, **diaxial** conformer, where the bromine is axial.\n5.  **Find the Correct Proton for Elimination:** In the diaxial conformer, we look at the carbons adjacent to the one with the axial bromine (C1). These are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position, which means the proton on C2 is in the equatorial position. Since this proton is not axial, elimination cannot occur towards C2 to form 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two protons. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The axial proton on C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n6.  **Determine the Product:** Because the only available anti-periplanar proton is on C6, the base will abstract this proton, and the double bond will form between C1 and C6. The methyl group on C2 is unaffected. The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThe python code below will walk through these logical steps and print the final product name.\n\n```python\ndef find_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and determines the name of the product.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Task: Identify the product of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane treated with potassium tert-butoxide.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the reaction conditions.\")\n    print(\"-> Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (a secondary alkyl halide).\")\n    print(\"-> Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, sterically hindered base).\")\n    print(\"-> Conclusion: The reaction is an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Understanding the stereochemical requirements for an E2 reaction.\")\n    print(\"-> The E2 mechanism requires an 'anti-periplanar' geometry.\")\n    print(\"-> In a cyclohexane chair, this means the leaving group (Br) and the beta-proton (H) MUST BOTH BE AXIAL.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the conformations of the starting material.\")\n    print(\"-> (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.\")\n    print(\"-> It exists primarily in a stable 'diequatorial' conformation (Br and methyl are both equatorial).\")\n    print(\"-> This stable conformer is UNREACTIVE for E2 because the Br is not axial.\")\n    print(\"-> The reaction must proceed through the less stable 'diaxial' conformer, where Br and methyl are both axial.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Identifying the site of elimination from the reactive (diaxial) conformer.\")\n    print(\"-> In the diaxial conformer, the Br is AXIAL on C1.\")\n    print(\"-> We look for an AXIAL proton on an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\")\n    print(\"  - On C2: The methyl group is AXIAL, so the proton on C2 is EQUATORIAL.
