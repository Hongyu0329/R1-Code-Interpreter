# The plan is to conceptually calculate the change in N_eff based on the described physics.
# N_eff is a parameter that measures the total energy density of relativistic particles beyond photons.
# Any process that adds energy to the neutrino population will increase N_eff.

# 1. Start with the Standard Model value of N_eff.
# This value represents the energy density from the three known neutrino species.
N_eff_SM = 3.044

# 2. Model the contribution from the new particle's decay.
# The new particle decays into neutrinos, which means it injects energy into the neutrino population.
# This additional energy can be represented as a positive contribution to N_eff, which we'll call Delta_N_eff.
# Let's assume a hypothetical positive value for this contribution to illustrate the effect.
# The value is arbitrary; what matters is that it is positive.
Delta_N_eff = 0.5

# 3. Calculate the new value of N_eff.
# The new N_eff is simply the sum of the standard value and the additional contribution.
N_eff_new = N_eff_SM + Delta_N_eff

# 4. Print the explanation and the final result.
print("The effective number of neutrino species, N_eff, parameterizes the relativistic energy density.")
print(f"In the Standard Model, N_eff (N_eff_SM) is approximately {N_eff_SM}.")
print("\nThe hypothetical particle decays, injecting a positive amount of energy into the neutrinos.")
print(f"This new energy contribution corresponds to a change, Delta_N_eff = {Delta_N_eff}.")

print("\nThe final N_eff is the sum of the standard contribution and the new one.")
# As requested, printing the numbers in the final equation:
print("\nFinal Equation:")
print(f"{N_eff_new:.3f} = {N_eff_SM} + {Delta_N_eff}")

print("\nConclusion:")
if N_eff_new > N_eff_SM:
    print("As the new value is greater than the standard one, N_eff would increase.")
else:
    # This branch is not expected to be reached based on the problem description.
    print("N_eff would not increase.")
