# p represents the percentage of semantically equivalent but lexically different relations.
# The value is given as 35%, so in decimal form it is 0.35.
p = 0.35

# In a theoretical best-case scenario, the model makes no wrong alignments (no False Positives).
# Precision = TP / (TP + FP). If FP = 0, Precision = 1.0.
precision = 1.0

# The model cannot find alignments that rely on the p% of lexically different relations.
# These become False Negatives. So, the maximum possible Recall is 1 - p.
recall = 1 - p

# The F1 score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
# The Jensen-Shannon divergence (d=0.4) is ignored as it affects practical difficulty,
# not the theoretical information-based limit.
