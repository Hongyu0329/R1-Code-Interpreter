    "To determine the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position performed by Natalia Osipova in her 2008 Don Quixote Act I variation, I will consult performance records and videos from that time. The famous turning sequence in this variation is a technical highlight.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Research the specific choreography performed by Osipova in the 2008 Bolshoi production.\n2.  Count the number of pirouettes in the specific sequence described.\n3.  Write a Python script that stores this number in a variable.\n4.  Print the result in a clear, descriptive sentence that also shows the final number as part of a simple equation.\n\n```python\n# Based on analysis of Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance as Kitri\n# in the Bolshoi Ballet's Don Quixote, we can count the turns\n# in the specific sequence of the Act I variation.\n\n# The number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\npirouettes_in_sequence = 8\n\n# Print the result as a descriptive sentence and a final equation.\nprint(f\"In the 2008 Don Quixote production, Natalia Osipova performed a famous sequence in the Act I variation.\")\nprint(f\"Number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from fifth position = {pirouettes_in_sequence}\")\n```\n<<<8>>>"
