    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Find an expression for the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$)**: We'll use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states the relationship between the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) is $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. We'll consider the minimum uncertainty, so we can write $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n2.  **Find an expression for the momentum in the first Bohr orbit ($p_1$)**: The Bohr model quantizes the angular momentum of an electron as $L = mvr = n\\hbar$. Since momentum $p=mv$, we can write this as $pr = n\\hbar$. For the first orbit (n=1), the momentum is $p_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$, where $r_1$ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (the Bohr radius).\n3.  **Determine the ratio**: We need to find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1}$. By substituting the expressions from the previous steps, the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ cancels out, simplifying the expression significantly:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{\\hbar / (2 \\Delta x)}{\\hbar / r_1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x} $$\n4.  **Calculate the value**: We will substitute the given value for the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$) and the known value for the Bohr radius ($r_1 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$) into our simplified equation to find the final numerical ratio.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its\n    momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the known physical constants and given values.\n    # Radius of the first Bohr orbit (r_1) in meters.\n    r_1 = 5.29177e-11\n    # Given uncertainty in position (delta_x) is 10 pm, which is 10e-12 meters.\n    delta_x = 10e-12\n\n    # 2. Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula derived from the principles:\n    # Ratio = (delta_p / p_1) = r_1 / (2 * delta_x)\n    ratio = r_1 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n    # 3. Print the final result and the equation with the numbers plugged in.\n    print(\"The problem is to find the ratio of momentum uncertainty to momentum (Δp/p).\")\n    print(\"This simplifies to the formula: Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)\")\n    print(\"\\nGiven values:\")\n    print(f\"Bohr Radius (r₁): {r_1} m\")\n    print(f\"Position Uncertainty (Δx): {delta_x} m\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {r_1} / (2 * {delta_x})\")\n    print(f\"Final Ratio = {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_momentum_ratio()\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
