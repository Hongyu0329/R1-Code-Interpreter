    "My plan is to deduce the transformation rule from the provided examples and then apply it to the new input to find the missing output.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation of the rule:**\n\n1.  **Observation**: In both examples A and B, a '2' from one row appears to be swapped with a '0' from the row directly above it. The original position of the '2' becomes a '0'.\n2.  **Hypothesis**: The '2' at position `(r, c)` moves to a '0' in row `r-1`. The main challenge is to figure out *which* '0' in that row is chosen as the target.\n3.  **Analyzing the choice of target '0'**:\n    *   In Example A, the row above the '2' is `'001111'`, which has '0's at columns 0 and 1. The chosen target is the '0' at column 0 (the *first* one).\n    *   In Example B, the row above the '2' is `'1111000011110'`, which has '0's at columns 4, 5, 6, and 7. The chosen target is the '0' at column 7 (the *last* one).\n4.  **Finding the deciding factor**: The choice between the first and last available '0' must depend on some local condition around the '2'. Let's inspect the row where the '2' is located.\n    *   Let's count the number of '0's to the left and right of the '2' in its own row.\n    *   **In Example A**: The row is `'121111'`. The '2' is at index 1.\n        *   Left of '2': `'1'`. Number of '0's = 0.\n        *   Right of '2': `'1111'`. Number of '0's = 0.\n        *   The counts are equal (0 == 0). In this case of a tie, the rule is to pick the **first** available '0' in the row above. This matches the output.\n    *   **In Example B**: The row is `'1111002111111'`. The '2' is at index 6.\n        *   Left of '2': `'111100'`. Number of '0's = 2.\n        *   Right of '2': `'111111'`. Number of '0's = 0.\n        *   The left side has more '0's than the right side (2 > 0). In this case, the rule is to pick the **last** available '0' in the row above. This also matches the output.\n5.  **Final Rule Formulation**:\n    1.  Find the position of '2' at `(r, c)`.\n    2.  Count the '0's to the left and right of `c` in row `r`.\n    3.  If the count of '0's on the left is greater than on the right, pick the *last* '0' from the row above (`r-1`).\n    4.  Otherwise (if left count is less than or equal to the right count), pick the *first* '0' from the row above.\n    5.  Swap the values at `(r, c)` and the target position in row `r-1`.\n\nNow, I will implement this logic in a Python script to solve for `Input_C`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by applying the derived transformation rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
