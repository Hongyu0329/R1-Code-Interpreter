    "To determine how many ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules are released when 1,4-¹³C glucose goes through glycolysis, we need to trace the labeled carbons through the metabolic pathway. While glycolysis itself does not produce CO₂, the subsequent step, pyruvate decarboxylation (the link reaction), does. This is typically considered the first stage of CO₂ release from glucose breakdown.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify Labeled Carbons:** Start with glucose, where carbons C1 and C4 are labeled with ¹³C.\n2.  **Trace Through Glycolysis:** Follow these labels as the 6-carbon glucose is split into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The aldolase enzyme splits fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (derived from glucose) into two molecules: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).\n    *   GAP comes from carbons C4, C5, and C6 of glucose. Therefore, the ¹³C from C4 ends up as the C1 carbon of this GAP.\n    *   DHAP comes from carbons C1, C2, and C3 of glucose. The ¹³C from C1 ends up as the C3 carbon of DHAP. DHAP is then isomerized to GAP, so the second GAP molecule is labeled at its C3 position.\n3.  **Analyze Pyruvate Formation:** Each GAP molecule is converted to pyruvate, with the carbon numbering preserved. This results in two pyruvate molecules:\n    *   One pyruvate is labeled at C1 (the carboxyl group).\n    *   The other pyruvate is labeled at C3 (the methyl group).\n4.  **Analyze Pyruvate Decarboxylation:** The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, releasing the C1 carboxyl group as CO₂.\n5.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:** Determine which of the CO₂ molecules released comes from a labeled carbon. The pyruvate with the ¹³C label at C1 will release a ¹³CO₂ molecule. The other pyruvate will release an unlabeled CO₂ molecule.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glycolysis_carbons():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis\n    and pyruvate decarboxylation to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Tracing the fate of carbons from 1,4-13C glucose...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # 1.
