    # --- Part a) ---
    # For a string starter P with bi-degree (a, b) = (4, 3), it acts as a lowest
    # weight vector for an sl(2) representation. The weight is lambda = b - a.
    # The terminal polynomial is the highest weight vector, with weight -lambda = a - b.
    # An operator E maps a polynomial of bi-degree (d_x, d_y) to (d_x - 1, d_y + 1).
    # If the terminal polynomial is E^k * P, its bi-degree is (a-k, b+k).
    # Its weight is (b+k) - (a-k) = b - a + 2k.
    # Setting this equal to the highest weight: b - a + 2k = a - b => 2k = 2(a - b) => k = a - b.
    # The bi-degree of the terminal polynomial E^(a-b) * P is (a - (a-b), b + (a-b)) = (b, a).

    # --- Part b) ---
    # The condition for a polynomial of bi-degree (a, b) to be a starter is a >= b.
    # We assume a construction starting from the Vandermonde determinant Delta_n(x),
    # which has bi-degree (C(n,2), 0). The term C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient "n choose k".
    # The phrasing "indices r_1, ..., r_b" suggests a construction using b operators,
    # where the i-th operator O_{r_i} is indexed by r_i and increases the y-degree by 1.
    # Let's assume O_{r_i} decreases the x-degree by r_i.
    # The final bi-degree (a, b) is then given by:
    # a = C(n,2) - sum(r_i for i=1 to b)
    # b = b
    # The condition a >= b becomes: C(n,2) - sum(r_i) >= b.
    # This gives the final condition.
    # We print the components of this inequality.
    print("b) The condition is: sum_{i=1 to b} r_i + b <= C(n, 2)")
    # The instruction says "output each number in the final equation".
    # As the equation is symbolic, we will represent it with text.
    # Let's show the variables in the formula.

    print("   'C(n, 2)' is the binomial coefficient n-choose-2, which is n*(n-1)/2.")


    # --- Part c) ---
    # We want to construct a polynomial of bi-degree (5, 2) using operators
    # E_{r,0} with r in {1, 2}.
    # The operator E_{r,0} maps a polynomial of bi-degree (d_x, d_y) to (d_x - 1, d_y + r).
    # Let's start from Delta_n(x), which has bi-degree (C(n,2), 0).
    # To get y-degree=2, we can use one E_{2,0} operator or two E_{1,0} operators.
    # Case 1: One E_{2,0} operator.
    # Number of operators k=1. Final bi-degree is (C(n,2) - 1, 0 + 2).
    # We need C(n,2) - 1 = 5, so C(n,2) = 6.
    # n*(n-1)/2 = 6  => n*(n-1) = 12 => n = 4.
    # This works for n=4. A valid construction exists.
    # Therefore, it is possible.
