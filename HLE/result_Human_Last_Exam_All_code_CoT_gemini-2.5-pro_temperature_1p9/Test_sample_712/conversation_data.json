    "To answer your question, I will write a Python script. The script's purpose is to identify the genus of bacterium that produces a chemical compound known to exhibit triboluminescent properties. The script will store the name of the genus in a variable and then print the full answer, followed by the specific genus name in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef find_bacterium_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the genus of a bacterium that produces a triboluminescent compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus of bacterium known for producing the enzyme luciferase,\n    # which can exhibit triboluminescence when crystallized and crushed.\n    genus = \"Photorhabdus\"\n    \n    # The chemical compound is an enzyme.\n    compound = \"luciferase\"\n\n    # Print the detailed answer\n    print(f\"The genus of bacterium that produces a chemical compound exhibiting triboluminescent properties is {genus}.\")\n    print(f\"Specifically, dried crystals of the {compound} enzyme produced by bacteria of the genus {genus} will glow when crushed.\")\n\n    # Print the final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"<<<{genus}>>>\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_bacterium_genus()\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What genus of bacterium produces a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
