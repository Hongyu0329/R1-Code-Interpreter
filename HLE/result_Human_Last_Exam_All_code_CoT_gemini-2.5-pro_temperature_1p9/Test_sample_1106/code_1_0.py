# Set the parameters from the problem description.
# The dimension of the space where the hypersphere exists.
d = 8
# The number of points placed on the hypersphere.
n_points = 15

# The problem is to find the minimized maximum number of points in any
# closed hyper-hemisphere. This corresponds to a known result in
# combinatorial geometry for the specific case where the number of points (N)
# relates to the dimension (d) by the formula N = 2d - 1.
# Here, N = 15 and d = 8, and indeed 15 = 2 * 8 - 1.
#
# The theorem states that for N = 2d - 1 points, the value we are looking for
# is given by the formula: k = d + floor((d - 1) / 2).
# This value 'k' is the minimal possible maximum number of points that can be
# found in any single closed hyper-hemisphere. The question asks for this value.

# We will now calculate 'k' and print the steps of the equation.

print("\nCalculating the result:")

# Step 1: Substitute d=8 into the formula
d_minus_1 = d - 1
print(f"k = {d} + floor(({d} - 1) / 2)")

# Step 2: Calculate the term in the parentheses
print(f"k = {d} + floor({d_minus_1} / 2)")

# Step 3: Perform the division and the floor operation
floor_val = math.floor(d_minus_1 / 2)
print(f"k = {d} + {floor_val}")

# Step 4: Perform the final addition
result = d + floor_val
print(f"k = {result}")
