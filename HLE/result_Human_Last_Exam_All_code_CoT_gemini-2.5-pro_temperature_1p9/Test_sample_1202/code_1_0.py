Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes:

1.  **Understanding the Core Problem:** After a gene is duplicated, the new copy is redundant. For it to be kept (retained) and become different from the original (diverge) in the long run, there must be an evolutionary mechanism that protects it from being lost and promotes its evolution.

2.  **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene sequence replaces another homologous sequence, making them identical. This mechanism actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, it is incorrect.
    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate, where the duplicate gene accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene). While this involves divergence, it is a failure of *retention* of a functional gene, not a mechanism for it.
    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original function, while the duplicate acquires mutations that result in a completely new function. This new function is favored by natural selection, leading to both retention and divergence. This is a valid and important mechanism.
    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., active in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that inactivate different sub-functions. For example, copy 1 loses function A but keeps B, while copy 2 loses B but keeps A. Now, both genes are necessary to perform the original collective functions, ensuring their retention and allowing them to diverge. This is also a valid and important mechanism.
    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes the rapid diversification of species to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material for this process, adaptive radiation itself is a large-scale evolutionary pattern, not the molecular mechanism responsible for the fate of a specific duplicate gene.

3.  **Comparing the Strongest Candidates (C and D):**
    Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the 'most likely' one. Subfunctionalization depends on complementary loss-of-function mutations, which are relatively common genetic events. Neofunctionalization requires a rarer gain-of-function mutation that creates a new benefit before the gene is lost. Because of this, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization represents a more common and passive route for initially preserving a duplicate gene from being lost, making it a "more likely" mechanism.

4.  **Conclusion:** Based on this reasoning, Subfunctionalization is the most likely mechanism responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes among the choices provided.
