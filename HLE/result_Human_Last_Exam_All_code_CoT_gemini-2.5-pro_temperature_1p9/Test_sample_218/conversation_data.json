    "To find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Representations and Partitions**: The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. An integer partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the summands does not matter. For $n=25$, we are looking for partitions like $(25)$, $(24, 1)$, $(1, 1, ..., 1)$, etc.\n\n2.  **Dimension Calculation**: For each partition $\\lambda$ of $n$, the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation is given by the hook-length formula. This formula states that the dimension is $n!$ divided by the product of the hook lengths of all cells in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. The hook length of a cell is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one (for the cell itself).\n\n3.  **Algorithm**: The plan is to implement a Python script that will:\n    a. Generate all possible integer partitions of $n=25$.\n    b. For each partition, calculate the dimension of the corresponding irrep using the hook-length formula. This calculation will be done using Python's arbitrary-precision integers to handle the large numbers involved (like $25!$).\n    c. Compare the calculated dimension against the threshold of 500,000.\n    d. Keep a count of the partitions whose corresponding irrep dimension is strictly less than the threshold.\n    e. Finally, print the total count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_partitions(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n as a list of lists.\n    Partitions are returned in non-increasing order.\n    This implementation uses memoization to cache results for subproblems.\n    \"\"\"\n    memo = {}\n    def _get_partitions_recursive(target, max_val):\n        key = (target, max_val)\n        if key in memo:\n            return memo[key]\n        \n        if target == 0:\n            return [[]]\n        \n        if target < 1 or max_val < 1:\n            return []\n        \n        res = []\n        # Iterate from min(target, max_val) down to 1 to generate parts in non-increasing order\n        for i in range(min(target, max_val), 0, -1):\n            sub_partitions = _get_partitions_recursive(target - i, i)\n            for sub_p in sub_partitions:\n                res.append([i] + sub_p)\n        \n        memo[key] = res\n        return res\n\n    return _get_partitions_recursive(n, n)\n\ndef calculate_dimension(partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the irreducible representation for a given partition\n    of n using the hook-length formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = sum(partition)\n    if not partition or n == 0:\n        return 1\n\n    # Python's native integers support arbitrary size, so direct calculation is fine.\n    numerator = math.factorial(n)\n    denominator = 1\n\n    # The transpose of the partition helps in calculating hook lengths.\n    # The length of the transpose is the size of the first part of the partition.\n    if not partition:\n        return 1\n    transpose = [0] * partition[0]\n    for part_val in partition:\n        for i in range(part_val):\n            transpose[i] += 1\n\n    # Iterate over the cells of the Young diagram (i: row, j: col, 0-indexed)\n    for i, part_len in enumerate(partition):\n        for j in range(part_len):\n            # The hook length for cell (r,c) (1-indexed) is (lambda_r - c) + (lambda'_c - r) + 1.\n            # Translating to 0-indexed i,j:\n            # hook = (partition[i] - (j+1)) + (transpose[j] - (i+1)) + 1\n            hook_length = (part_len - (j + 1)) + (transpose[j] - (i + 1)) + 1\n            denominator *= hook_length\n    \n    # The division must be exact for any valid partition.\n    return numerator // denominator\n\n# Set the parameters for the problem\nn = 25\nthreshold = 500000\n\n# Perform the calculation\ncount = 0\nall_partitions = get_partitions(n)\n\nfor p in all_partitions:\n    dim = calculate_dimension(p)\n    if dim < threshold:\n        count += 1\n        \n# The final answer is the total count.\n# The following print statement includes all numbers relevant to the problem's solution.\nprint(f\"The number of irreducible representations of S_{n} with dimension strictly less than {threshold} is: {count}\")\n\n```\n<<<74>>>"
