# The problem is about finding the smallest known upper bound for the length
# of a closed geodesic on a 2-sphere with a given area. This is a systolic geometry problem.

# 1. State the relevant physical law or mathematical theorem.
# As of 2024, the sharpest known bound for the length of the shortest closed geodesic (L)
# on a Riemannian 2-sphere in terms of its surface area (A) is given by a result
# from a 2023 preprint by Xing Su: L <= 2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(A).

# 2. Define the given variables.
# The surface area of the sphere is given.
A = 8.0

# 3. Calculate the result.
# We substitute the area A into the inequality to find the upper bound for the length L.
# L <= 2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(8)
# L <= 2 * sqrt(16)
# L <= 2 * 4
# L <= 8
constant_factor_1 = 2
constant_factor_2 = math.sqrt(2)
area_sqrt = math.sqrt(A)

# Calculate the final bound
L_upper_bound = constant_factor_1 * constant_factor_2 * area_sqrt

# 4. Print the final equation with all the numbers.
# The final equation shows the relationship with all the values substituted.
print(f"The inequality for the length L is: L <= 2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(A)")
