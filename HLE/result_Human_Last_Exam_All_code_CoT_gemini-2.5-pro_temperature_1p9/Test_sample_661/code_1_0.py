    Solves the Knuth-Bendix completion problem based on the provided details.
    
    The solution is derived based on the assumption that the third rule
    f(g(x),h(y)) -> h(x) contained a typo and was meant to be f(g(x),h(x)) -> h(x).
    Without this assumption, the initial system is ill-formed and the completion fails.
    
    The added rules are:
    1. g(f(x),f(x)) -> g(x)
    2. h(x) -> g(x)
    
    They are ordered increasingly by their left-hand side under the given LPO.
