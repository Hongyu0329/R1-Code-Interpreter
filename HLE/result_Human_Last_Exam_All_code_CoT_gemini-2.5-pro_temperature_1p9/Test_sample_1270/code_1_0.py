# The name "mercedesbenzene" suggests a molecule based on benzene,
# shaped like the Mercedes-Benz logo.

# 1. The "benzene" part refers to a benzene ring.
benzene_ring_carbons = 6

# 2. The "mercedes" part refers to the three-pointed star logo.
# This implies three symmetrically placed groups. The simplest
# carbon-based group is a methyl group, which has 1 carbon.
number_of_points = 3
carbons_per_point = 1
points_carbons = number_of_points * carbons_per_point

# 3. Calculate the total number of carbon atoms.
total_carbons = benzene_ring_carbons + points_carbons

# Print the final equation showing each part of the calculation
print(f"A benzene ring has {benzene_ring_carbons} carbons.")
print(f"The three 'points' of the Mercedes star add {number_of_points} * {carbons_per_point} = {points_carbons} carbons.")
print(f"Total carbons in mercedesbenzene = {benzene_ring_carbons} + {points_carbons} = {total_carbons}")
