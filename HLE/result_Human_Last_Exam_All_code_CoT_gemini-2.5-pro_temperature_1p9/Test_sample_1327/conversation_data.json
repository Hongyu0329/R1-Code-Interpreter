    "My approach is to find a recursive relationship between the terms in the sequence. I'll test for simple arithmetic and geometric progressions first. If those don't fit, I will look for a more complex pattern, such as `x(n+1) = a * x(n) + b(n)`, where `b(n)` is itself a sequence with a discernible pattern.\n\n1.  **Analyze the primary sequence:** Let the sequence be `S = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]`.\n2.  **Establish a recursive formula:** I'll check the relationship `x(n+1) = 2 * x(n) + c(n)`.\n    *   `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`\n    *   `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n    *   `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n    *   `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n3.  **Analyze the addend sequence:** The sequence of the numbers being added (`c(n)`) is `[7, 1, 5, 17]`. The first term seems to be an outlier, which is common in such puzzles. Let's analyze the pattern starting from the second term: `c' = [1, 5, 17]`.\n4.  **Find the pattern in the addend sequence:** I'll look at the differences between the terms in `c'`.\n    *   `5 - 1 = 4`\n    *   `17 - 5 = 12`\n5.  **Identify the pattern of the differences:** The differences are `[4, 12]`. This is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3.\n6.  **Predict the next terms:**\n    *   The next difference will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   The next addend in the `c'` sequence will be `17 + 36 = 53`.\n7.  **Calculate the final number:** The next number in the original sequence will be `2 * 119 + 53`.\n8.  **Construct the code:** The Python code will perform these calculations and print out the steps and the final equation to get the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by finding a recursive pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    s = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"The sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, s))}, ...\")\n\n    # The pattern is of the form: next_num = 2 * prev_num + addend\n    # Let's find the addends.
