# This script demonstrates the logical deduction for the given problem.
# We will use a concrete example of a graph: a triangle, assuming it's connected.
# V = {0, 1, 2}, E = {(0,1), (1,2), (2,0)}

# Step 1: Define the operators (incidence matrices) for the triangle graph.
# We use a standard convention where B1 represents the divergence operator and B1.T represents the gradient operator.
# Edge orientation: e0: 0->1, e1: 1->2, e2: 0->2 is not what we want for a cycle, lets use 2->0 for e2
# e0: 0->1, e1: 1->2, e2: 2->0
B1_T = np.array([
    [-1.,  1.,  0.],  # Edge e0 = (0,1) gradient
    [ 0., -1.,  1.],  # Edge e1 = (1,2) gradient
    [ 1.,  0., -1.]   # Edge e2 = (2,0) gradient (Note this makes a cycle for demonstration, a different B1_T gives a different graph)
])
# B1 is the vertex-edge incidence matrix, its transpose is the gradient operator
# The prompt seems to define B1 as the vertex-edge incidence matrix which would mean it represents divergence
# So we define the |V|x|E| divergence matrix B1.
B1 = B1_T.T

print("Plan: We will analyze the given premises step-by-step to reach a conclusion.")
print("The premises are:")
print("1. The signal x1 has zero sum over any cycle (is conservative).")
print("2. The expression B1 @ x1 @ 1.T = 0 holds (where 1 is a column vector of ones).")
print("3. The signal x1 is defined as x1_e = |x0_u - x0_v| for an edge signal x0.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Analyze Premise 1
print("Analysis of Premise 1: 'x1 has zero sum over any cycle'.")
print("This is the definition of a conservative field (or an exact 1-cochain).")
print("This means x1 must be the gradient of some vertex potential, let's call it y0.")
print("In matrix form: x1 = B1.T @ y0 for some vector y0 of size |V|.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Analyze Premise 2
print("Analysis of Premise 2: 'B1 @ x1 @ 1.T = 0'.")
print("Let's check the dimensions. B1 is |V|x|E|, x1 is |E|x1, 1 (ones) is |V|x1.")
print("The expression is computed as (B1 @ x1) @ 1.T.")
print("The term (B1 @ x1) is the divergence of x1, a vector 'd' of size |V|.")
print("The equation becomes d @ 1.T = 0_matrix(|V|x|V|).")
print("This is an outer product. For this to be a zero matrix, the vector d must be a zero vector.")
print("Therefore, this premise simplifies to: B1 @ x1 = 0. The divergence of x1 is zero.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 4: Combine Premises 1 and 2
print("Combining Premise 1 (x1 = B1.T @ y0) and Premise 2 (B1 @ x1 = 0):")
print("Substitute x1 in the second equation: B1 @ (B1.T @ y0) = 0.")
print("The matrix (B1 @ B1.T) is the Graph Laplacian, L0.")
L0 = B1 @ B1.T
print("So we have the equation: L0 @ y0 = 0.")
print("Let's compute L0 for our triangle example:")
print(L0)
print("\nThe equation L0 @ y0 = 0 means that y0 is in the null space of the Laplacian.")
print("For any connected graph, the null space of L0 is the set of constant vectors.")
print("So, y0 must be a constant vector, e.g., y0 = c * [1, 1, ..., 1].T for some constant c.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 5: Find x1
print("Now we find x1 using the fact that y0 is constant.")
print("From Premise 1: x1 = B1.T @ y0.")
# Let's take an example constant c=5. The result is independent of c (unless c=0).
c = 5
y0_example = c * np.ones((B1.shape[0], 1))
x1_deduced = B1.T @ y0_example
print(f"Let's compute x1 with a constant potential y0 (e.g., y0 = {y0_example.flatten()}):")
print(f"x1 = B1.T @ y0 = {x1_deduced.flatten()}")
print("\nAs shown, the gradient of a constant potential is the zero vector. So, we deduce x1 = 0.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 6: Use Premise 3 and evaluate the answer choices
print("Finally, we use Premise 3: x1_e = |x0_u - x0_v|.")
print("Since we deduced that x1 must be the zero vector, it must be that |x0_u - x0_v| = 0 for all edges {u,v}.")
print("This implies x0 is constant across all connected vertices.")
print("Now let's check the answer choices.")
print("Choice D states: 'G has total variation = 0'.")
print("Total Variation (TV) is defined as the sum of absolute differences across edges: TV = sum(|x0_u - x0_v|).")
print("From Premise 3, this is equal to the sum of the components of x1.")

x1_values = x1_deduced.flatten()

for val in x1_values:
    final_equation += f"{val:.0f} + "
final_equation = final_equation[:-3] # remove last ' + '
sum_val = np.sum(x1_values)
final_equation += f" = {sum_val:.0f}"

print("The final equation for Total Variation is:")
print(final_equation)
print("\nSince all components of x1 are 0, the total variation is 0.")
print("Therefore, the correct inference is D.")
