# The problem asks for the property equivalent to a function f being continuous
# in the context of nonstandard analysis.

# Let's review the options based on the nonstandard definition of continuity.
# The standard theorem states that a function f: X -> Y is continuous if and only if
# for every standard point x0 in X, f maps the monad of x0 into the monad of f(x0).
# In symbols, this is: for all standard x0 in X and for all x1 in the nonstandard
# extension X*, if x1 is infinitesimally close to x0 (x1 ~ x0), then f(x1) is
# infinitesimally close to f(x0) (f(x1) ~ f(x0)).

# This corresponds exactly to option B.
# B. for all x0 in X, for all x1 in X*: x0 ~ x1 ==> f(x0) ~ f(x1)

# Option C (for all x0, x1 in X*: x0 ~ x1 ==> f(x0) ~ f(x1)) is the definition of
# a stronger property, uniform continuity.

# Options D, E, F reverse the implication and are not related to continuity.
# Option A is too weak as it only considers standard points.

# Therefore, the correct answer is B.
