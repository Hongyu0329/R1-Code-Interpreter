# This script simulates the error message from the Godot 4.3 IDE.
# The error is in the GDscript line: if "texture" in list(json_data):
# GDscript does not have a built-in `list()` function like Python.
# The parser will fail because the identifier 'list' is unknown.

# The exact error message text:
error_message = "The identifier \"list\" isn't declared in the current scope."

# Print the final error message.
# Note: The Godot IDE would also prepend the script path, line, and column number.
# For example: res://your_script.gd:4:23 - Parse Error:
# However, the core text of the error message is what's requested.
