    "Answering the question \"How many different types of stable reduction are there for curves of genus 2?\" requires exploring the combinatorial classification of stable curves of genus 2. A stable curve is a potentially singular curve with specific constraints, and its \"type\" is determined by its dual graph, which captures how its irreducible components are connected.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the mathematical conditions for a stable reduction type.**\n    A stable reduction of a genus `g` curve is characterized by a \"decorated dual graph\" (a graph where vertices are labeled with genera). Let `g` be the genus of the original curve (here, `g=2`). Let the dual graph of the reduction be `G`, with `v` vertices (irreducible components) and `e` edges (nodes connecting components).\n    The combinatorial type must satisfy two conditions based on algebraic geometry:\n    *   **Genus Formula:** `g = h¹(G) + Σ gᵢ`, where `h¹(G) = e - v + 1` is the graph's first Betti number (number of loops), and `gᵢ` is the geometric genus of the component corresponding to vertex `vᵢ`.\n    *   **Stability Condition:** For any component with genus `gᵢ = 0` (a rational curve), the corresponding vertex `vᵢ` must be connected to at least 3 special points (nodes or marked points). In our case, this means its degree `deg(vᵢ)` must be 3 or more. (A self-loop at `vᵢ` contributes 2 to its degree).\n\n2.  **Implement a Python script.**\n    The script will programmatically enumerate and check potential graph structures against these two conditions for `g=2`. It will investigate small graphs (classified by their number of vertices and edges) and possible genus assignments for the components. For each configuration that satisfies both the genus formula and the stability condition, it will be counted as a valid type and its details will be printed.\n\n3.  **Output the count.**\n    The script will print the final count of all valid types found.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this enumeration:\n\n```python\ndef solve_stable_reduction_g2():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function enumerates and verifies the types of stable reductions for curves of genus 2.\n\n    A type is defined by a decorated dual graph (vertices are components, edges are nodes).\n    It must satisfy two conditions for genus g=2:\n    1. Genus Formula: 2 = h1(G) + sum(g_i), where h1(G) = e - v + 1 is the number of loops\n       in the graph G with v vertices and e edges, and g_i is the genus of component i.\n    2. Stability: If a component has genus g_i = 0, its vertex must have degree >= 3.\n       (A self-loop adds 2 to the degree).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Finding the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    stable_types_found = []\n\n    # Let's analyze candidate graph structures.\n\n    # --- Case 1: Irreducible Curves (1 component/vertex) ---\n    # The graph has 1 vertex (v=1). h1 = e - 1 + 1 = e, where e is the number of self-loops (nodes).\n    # The formula is 2 = e + g_1.\n    \n    # Candidate 1.1: 1 vertex, g=1, 1 node (1 self-loop)\n    v, e, g_list = 1, 1, [1]\n    g = 2\n    h1 = e - v + 1\n    sum_g = sum(g_list)\n    is_genus_formula_ok = (g == h1 + sum_g)\n    deg_v1 = 2 * e\n    is_stable = not (g_list[0] == 0 and deg_v1 < 3)\n    if is_genus_formula_ok and is_stable:\n        desc = \"Irreducible elliptic curve with one node.\"\n        stable_types_found.append((desc, g, h1, sum_g))\n\n    # Candidate 1.2: 1 vertex, g=0, 2 nodes (2 self-loops)\n    v, e, g_list = 1, 2, [0]\n    g = 2\n    h1 = e - v + 1\n    sum_g = sum(g_list)\n    is_genus_formula_ok = (g == h1 + sum_g)\n    deg_v1 = 2 * e\n    is_stable = not (g_list[0] == 0 and deg_v1 < 3)\n    if is_genus_formula_ok and is_stable:\n        desc = \"Irreducible rational curve with two nodes.\"\n        stable_types_found.append((desc, g, h1, sum_g))\n\n    # --- Case 2: Reducible Curves (v > 1) ---\n\n    # Candidate 2.1: 2 elliptic components, joined by 1 node\n    # Graph: v=2, e=1 (edge v1-v2). g_list=[1,1].\n    v, e, g_list = 2, 1, [1, 1]\n    g = 2\n    h1 = e - v + 1\n    sum_g = sum(g_list)\n    is_genus_formula_ok = (g == h1 + sum_g)\n    # Stability: No rational components, so condition is met.\n    is_stable = True\n    if is_genus_formula_ok and is_stable:\n        desc = \"Two elliptic curves meeting at one node.\"\n        stable_types_found.append((desc, g, h1, sum_g))\n        \n    # Candidate 2.2: Elliptic curve meets a nodal rational curve at one point\n    # Graph: v=2, v1(g=1), v2(g=0). e=2 (edge v1-v2 and a self-loop on v2).\n    v, e, g_list = 2, [1, 0] # genera for v1, v2\n    g = 2\n    # The graph topology has 2 vertices, an edge between them, and a loop on one.
