    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for sterile preparations is governed by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically Chapter <797>. The rules vary depending on the container type and the environment in which it is opened.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the BUD for a single-dose ampule:\n1.  **Identify the container type:** The user specified a \"single-dose container ampule\". An ampule is a glass container that is broken to be opened and cannot be resealed.\n2.  **Identify the environment:** The user specified a \"sterile environment,\" which implies an ISO Class 5 or better environment as required for sterile compounding.\n3.  **Consult the relevant guideline (USP <797>):** For ampules, the rule is very strict. Once an ampule is opened, it is considered an open system, making it highly susceptible to airborne contamination.\n4.  **State the conclusion:** Because it cannot be sealed to protect against contamination, the contents of an opened ampule must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored for any length of time.\n\nThe following Python code will print this information and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef get_ampule_bud():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    based on United States Pharmacopeia (USP) <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    container_type = \"Single-dose ampule\"\n    environment = \"Sterile environment (e.g., ISO Class 5)\"\n\n    print(f\"Question: What is the BUD for a {container_type} opened in a {environment}?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"Analysis based on USP <797> guidelines:\")\n    print(\"1. An ampule is a glass container that is broken open and cannot be resealed.\")\n    print(\"2. Once opened, it becomes an open-system container, highly susceptible to contamination.\")\n    print(\"3. Because of this high risk, the contents must be used without any delay.\")\n    print(\"4. Any unused portion must be discarded immediately and cannot be stored.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    print(\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is: Immediate Use\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_ampule_bud()\n```\n<<<Immediate Use>>>"
