    # Part 1: The argument that Postulate 2 can be derived from Postulate 1.
    print("--- Argument 1: Why it might seem superfluous ---")
    print("1. Postulate 1 (The Principle of Relativity): The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.")
    print("2. A fundamental set of physical laws are Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism.")
    print("3. These equations predict that light waves in a vacuum travel at a specific speed, 'c'.")
    print("   This speed is determined by two fundamental constants of nature: the vacuum permittivity (ε₀) and the vacuum permeability (μ₀).")

    # Here we present the equation and follow the specific output instruction.

    print("   If the 'laws of physics' (i.e., Maxwell's equations) are the same for all observers, as stated by Postulate 1,")
    print("   then the value of 'c' predicted by those laws must also be the same for all observers.")
    print("   This is precisely what Postulate 2 states. Therefore, Postulate 2 seems to be a direct consequence of Postulate 1.")

    # Part 2: The counter-argument explaining why it's not superfluous.
    print("\n--- Argument 2: Why it is essential and NOT superfluous ---")
    print("1. Historically, this conclusion created a major paradox.")
    print("2. It contradicted the well-established Galilean transformations, which are the classical rules for adding velocities.")
    print("   (e.g., if you are on a train moving at 50 mph and throw a ball forward at 10 mph, an observer on the ground sees the ball moving at 60 mph).")
    print("   Classical physics assumed this must also apply to light.")
    print("3. To resolve this conflict, most physicists before Einstein believed that Postulate 1 simply didn't apply to electromagnetism. They thought there must be a 'special' frame of reference (the 'luminiferous aether') where Maxwell's equations were true.")
    print("\n4. Einstein's revolutionary act was to insist that Postulate 1 DID apply to everything.")
    print("   By stating the constancy of the speed of light as a separate, second postulate, he did two things:")
    print("   a) He explicitly made it a foundational pillar of his new theory.")
    print("   b) He highlighted the central, non-intuitive idea that must be accepted, forcing a break with classical physics.")
    print("\n5. Postulate 2 is what forces us to abandon classical ideas. If the speed of light is absolute, then space and time must become relative.")
    print("-" * 60)

    # Final Conclusion
    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("So, while Postulate 2 can be derived from 'Postulate 1 + the validity of Maxwell's Equations', it is NOT considered superfluous.")
    print("It is stated separately because it is the crucial assertion that resolves the classical paradox in a revolutionary way. It makes clear that our intuitions about space and time must be replaced, leading directly to time dilation and length contraction.")
    print("\nIs it true that the 2nd postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first?")
