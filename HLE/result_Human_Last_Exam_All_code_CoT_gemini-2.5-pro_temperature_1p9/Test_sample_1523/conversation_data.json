    "Of course. In the functional integral formulation of finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, we can determine the inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)`. Here's a step-by-step explanation followed by Python code to represent the result symbolically.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Action:** The starting point is the Euclidean action `S[ϕ]` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`. In Euclidean spacetime `x = (τ, **x**)`, where `τ` is the imaginary time compactified on a circle of length `β = 1/T`, the free action is:\n    `S[ϕ] = ∫ dτ d³x [ 1/2 (∂_μ ϕ)² + 1/2 m² ϕ² ]`\n    where `(∂_μ ϕ)² = (∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)²`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Operator D:** The action can be written in a quadratic form, `S[ϕ] = 1/2 (ϕ, Dϕ)`, where `D` is a differential operator. To find `D`, we integrate the kinetic term by parts. Assuming the field `ϕ` is periodic in `τ` and vanishes at spatial infinity, the surface terms are zero:\n    `∫ d⁴x (∂_μ ϕ)² = ∫ d⁴x ∂_μ(ϕ ∂_μ ϕ) - ∫ d⁴x ϕ (∂_μ² ϕ) = - ∫ d⁴x ϕ (∂_μ² ϕ)`\n    Substituting this back into the action gives:\n    `S[ϕ] = 1/2 ∫ d⁴x [ -ϕ(∂_μ² ϕ) + m² ϕ² ] = 1/2 ∫ d⁴x ϕ(-∂_μ² + m²)ϕ`\n    From this, we can identify the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator `D = -∂_μ² + m²`.\n\n3.  **Define the Inner Product:** In this context, the inner product `(A, B)` is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions over Euclidean spacetime:\n    `(A, B) = ∫ d⁴x A(x)B(x)`\n\n4.  **Calculate (ϕ, Dϕ):** We want to compute `(ϕ, Dϕ)`. Using our definitions:\n    `(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) [D ϕ(x)] = ∫ d⁴x ϕ (-∂_μ² + m²) ϕ`\n    Using the same integration by parts from Step 2, this is equivalent to:\n    `(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ d⁴x [ (∂_μ ϕ)² + m² ϕ² ]`\n\n5.  **Final Result:** The expression `(∂_μ ϕ)² + m² ϕ²` is the integrand of the inner product. Notice that the inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)` is exactly twice the free action, `2 * S[ϕ]`. The Python code below will use the `sympy` library to symbolically construct and print this integrand.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef calculate_inner_product_integrand():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically calculates and prints the integrand for the inner product (ϕ, Dϕ)\n    in scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the coordinates and constants as symbolic variables\n    tau, x, y, z = sp.symbols('tau x y z')\n    m = sp.Symbol('m')\n\n    # Define the scalar field phi as a function of the spacetime coordinates\n    phi = sp.Function('phi')(tau, x, y, z)\n\n    # Calculate the partial derivatives of the field with respect to each coordinate\n    d_phi_d_tau = sp.diff(phi, tau)\n    d_phi_d_x = sp.diff(phi, x)\n    d_phi_d_y = sp.diff(phi, y)\n    d_phi_d_z = sp.diff(phi, z)\n\n    # Construct the squared kinetic term, (∂_μ ϕ)²\n    # Note: (∂_μ ϕ)² = (∂_τ ϕ)² + (∂_x ϕ)² + (∂_y ϕ)² + (∂_z ϕ)²\n    kinetic_term_sq = d_phi_d_tau**2 + d_phi_d_x**2 + d_phi_d_y**2 + d_phi_d_z**2\n\n    # Construct the mass term, m² ϕ²\n    mass_term = m**2 * phi**2\n\n    # The full integrand is the sum of the kinetic and mass terms.\n    integrand = kinetic_term_sq + mass_term\n\n    # Print the result.
