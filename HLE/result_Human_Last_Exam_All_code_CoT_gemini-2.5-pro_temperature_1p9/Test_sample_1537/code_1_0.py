    This problem explores the properties of a specific type of topological group.
    The mathematical reasoning leads to the conclusion that the largest possible
    number of non-open components of an open subset of such a group is c,
    the cardinality of the continuum (the number of points on the real line).
    """
    # The cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by 'c', is a transfinite number.
    # It cannot be stored as a standard numerical type in Python.
    # We will print the symbol 'c' to represent this value.
