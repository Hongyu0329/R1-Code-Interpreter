    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral to evaluate is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1. This form is a standard result from calculus. The antiderivative of a function of the form `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** Using the theorem, the value of the definite integral `V` is the antiderivative evaluated at the limits of integration:\n    `V = [ln(F₃(x))] from 0 to 1 = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n\n3.  **Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0):** I will determine the expression for `F₃(x)` and then evaluate it at x=1 and x=0.\n    *   `F₀(x) = x`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n    This gives us:\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Value:** I will substitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into the formula for `V`:\n    `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n\n5.  **Write the Python Code:** The code will use the `math` library to calculate the numerical value of `V`. It will then compute `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer as requested. The code will also print out the steps of the calculation, including the numerical values for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` as the numbers in the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Explain the analytical solution of the integral.\nprint(\"The integral to evaluate is V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\")\nprint(\"The antiderivative of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln(F₃(x)).\")\nprint(\"By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the value of the integral is:\")\nprint(\"V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Define F₃(x) and calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0).\n# F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\nf3_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\nf3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\nprint(\"The numbers in the final equation are F₃(1) and F₃(0).\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ {f3_at_1:.8f}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(2) ≈ {f3_at_0:.8f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the value of the integral, V.\nval_ln_f3_1 = math.log(f3_at_1)\nval_ln_f3_0 = math.log(f3_at_0)\nV = val_ln_f3_1 - val_ln_f3_0\n\nprint(\"Plugging these values into the expression for V:\")\n# We print each number that constitutes the final equation for V\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1:.8f}) - ln({f3_at_0:.8f})\")\nprint(f\"V ≈ {val_ln_f3_1:.8f} - ({val_ln_f3_0:.8f})\")\nprint(f\"V ≈ {V:.8f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final requested result.\nfinal_result = round(10000 * V)\nprint(\"The requested value is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V ≈ 10000 * {V:.8f} = {10000 * V:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {final_result}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n<<<{}>>>\".format(final_result))\n```"
