# The problem asks for the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (ghtw) of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.
# This is a problem from hypergraph theory. The answer is not derived from a simple computation
# but from analyzing the combinatorial properties of hypergraph decompositions.

# As shown in the step-by-step thinking process, the maximum value can be determined
# by finding a "worst-case" hypergraph with 3 edges and calculating its ghtw.

# Consider the hypergraph H with vertices V = {v1, v2, v3, c} and hyperedges:
# E1 = {v1, v2, c}
# E2 = {v2, v3, c}
# E3 = {v3, v1, c}

# The ghtw of this hypergraph H is 3.
# A decomposition with a single bag containing all 4 vertices {v1, v2, v3, c} has width 4 - 1 = 3.
# It can be formally proven that no decomposition of a smaller width (i.e., width 2, max bag size 3) exists.
# The argument is sketched in the thinking steps: any decomposition of width 2 would require a bag containing
# all 4 vertices to satisfy the vertex connectivity property, which is a contradiction.

# Since there exists a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges whose ghtw is 3, the maximum ghtw
# for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges must be at least 3.
# It is known that this is also the upper bound.

maximum_ghtw = 3
