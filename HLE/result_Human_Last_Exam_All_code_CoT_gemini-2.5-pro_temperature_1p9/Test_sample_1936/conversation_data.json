    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will state the definition of a group `(G, ·)`, which is a set `G` combined with a binary operation `·`. I will list the four axioms a structure must satisfy to be a group: Closure, Associativity, Identity element, and Inverse element.\n2.  The question asks for the smallest number `n` (the size of the set `G`) for which `(G, ·)` is *not* a group.\n3.  The size of a set, `n`, must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value for `n` to test is 0.\n4.  I will analyze the case where `n = 0`. The set `G` would be the empty set `{}`.\n5.  I will check if the empty set can form a group. I will focus on the \"Identity element\" axiom, which states that there must *exist* an element `e` *in* the set `G`.\n6.  For the empty set, this axiom cannot be satisfied because there are no elements in the set.\n7.  Since one of the group axioms fails, the empty set with its (vacuously defined) binary operation is not a group.\n8.  Because we found a non-group for `n=0`, and `n` cannot be any smaller, 0 must be the smallest such number.\n9.  I will write a Python script that prints this explanation and outputs the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the smallest number n\n    such that a set of n elements with a binary operation can be a non-group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the smallest number n such that there exists a set G with n elements and a binary operation · where (G, ·) is not a group, we first need to recall the definition of a group.\")\n    print(\"\\nA group is a set G with a binary operation · that must satisfy four fundamental axioms:\")\n    print(\"1. Closure: For any two elements a, b in G, the result a · b is also in G.\")\n    print(\"2. Associativity: For any three elements a, b, c in G, the equation (a · b) · c = a · (b · c) holds.\")\n    print(\"3. Identity Element: There must exist an element 'e' in G such that for every element 'a' in G, the equation e · a = a · e = a holds.\")\n    print(\"4. Inverse Element: For each element 'a' in G, there must exist an element 'b' in G such that a · b = b · a = e, where 'e' is the identity element.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe question asks for the smallest size 'n' of a set G that can be structured as a non-group.
