    Calculates the smallest integer u based on the logic derived from the problem statement.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. We want to find the smallest integer u such that for any set of agent preferences,
       a "suitable" subset of items O is guaranteed to exist.
    2. A constructive approach is taken: for any given preference profile, we define a candidate
       set O and show it must be suitable if u is large enough.
    3. Let n_i be the number of agents who rank item i as their absolute favorite.
    4. Define a set of "weak" items S_0 = {i | n_i <= t}.
    5. Our candidate for a suitable set is O = I \\ S_0 (all items not in S_0).

    6. Checking Condition 1 for O: "if every agent assigns themself to their favorite
       item in O, then no item in O has only <= t agents assigned to it".
       - For any item i in O, we know n_i > t.
       - The number of agents whose favorite item in O is i must be at least n_i, because all agents
         who rank i as their absolute #1 choice will also pick it as their favorite from O.
       - Therefore, the number of agents assigned to i is > t. Condition 1 holds for our O.

    7. Checking Condition 2 for O: "for every item j not in O, there are at most u
       agents that prefer that item over all items in O".
       - Let j be an item not in O (so, j is in S_0).
       - Let P(j, O) be the set of agents who prefer j over all items in O.
       - If an agent is in P(j, O), their absolute favorite item cannot be in O. It must be in S_0.
       - Therefore, the number of such agents |P(j, O)| is at most the sum of all agents
         whose favorite item is in S_0.
       - So, |P(j, O)| <= sum(n_k for k in S_0).
       - By definition, for any k in S_0, n_k <= t.
       - Thus, |P(j, O)| <= |S_0| * t.
    8. To guarantee Condition 2 holds, u must be at least this maximum possible value.
       The maximum size of S_0, for a non-empty O, is m-1.
       In the case O is empty, S_0 has size m. Cond 1 is vacuously true. Cond 2 requires
       n_j <= u for all j. Since n_j <= t in this case, we'd need u >= t.
       In the case O is not empty, |S_0| <= m-1, so we need u >= (m-1)*t.
    9. Since m=4, (m-1)*t is greater than t. Thus, the more general and stringent
       condition is u >= (m-1)*t.
    10. The smallest integer u that guarantees a suitable set can be found is (m-1)*t.
        This is the minimal value because a counter-example profile can be constructed
        to show that any u < (m-1)*t is insufficient.

    m = 4  # number of items
    t = 20 # assignment threshold

    u = (m - 1) * t
    
    print(f"The given parameters are m = {m} and t = {t}.")
    print("The smallest integer u such that a suitable subset O is always guaranteed to exist is determined by the formula u = (m - 1) * t.")
    print(f"Plugging in the values, we get:")
