    print("Gödel's proof is a formal argument in metaphysics and modal logic.")
    print("It uses axioms and definitions to argue for the existence of a 'God-like' being.")

    print("=======================================================")
    print("Quantum Mechanics (QM) is a physical theory describing nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.")
    print("Its mathematical framework uses concepts like Hilbert spaces, operators, and wavefunctions.")
    print("Key Concepts: 'observables', 'state vectors', 'probabilities', 'eigenvalues'.")

    print("==================================================")
