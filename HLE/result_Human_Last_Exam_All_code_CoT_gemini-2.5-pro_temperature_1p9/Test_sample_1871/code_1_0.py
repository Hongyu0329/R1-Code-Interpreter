    # The problem is to compute D_x rho(alpha, beta), which is the partial
    # derivative of the signed distance function rho with respect to its first variable,
    # evaluated at a point (alpha, beta).
    
    # Let (u, v) be a point in R^2. The nearest point on the curve y = x^5 is (x, x^5).
    # The analysis of the l-infinity norm and the nearest point condition reveals
    # that for points like (alpha, beta), the coordinate of the nearest point 'x'
    # and the distance 'rho' are implicitly defined by a system of equations.
    # We found this system to be:
    # 1) u + v = x^5 + x
    # 2) rho = x - u

    # We differentiate this system with respect to u to find d(rho)/du.
    # Differentiating (1):
    # d/du(u + v) = d/du(x^5 + x)
    # 1 = (5*x^4 + 1) * dx/du
    # => dx/du = 1 / (5*x^4 + 1)
    # Differentiating (2):
    # d(rho)/du = d/du(x - u)
    # d(rho)/du = dx/du - 1
    # Substituting dx/du:
    # d(rho)/du = (1 / (5*x^4 + 1)) - 1
    # d(rho)/du = (1 - (5*x^4 + 1)) / (5*x^4 + 1)
    # d(rho)/du = -5*x^4 / (5*x^4 + 1)

    # We are given that the nearest point on the curve to (alpha, beta) is (1,1).
    # This means we must evaluate the derivative at x=1.
