    "Answering this question requires applying several fundamental theorems from algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory. The plan is to determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces, and then analyze the map on the lowest-dimensional non-trivial homotopy groups.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Connectivity**: A map $f: A \\to B$ is k-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n2.  **Identify Spaces**: The source space is $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 )$ and the target space is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n3.  **Connectivity of Target Space**: Use standard homotopy equivalences and theorems to find the connectivity of $B$. The connectivity of a space $X$, denoted $c(X)$, is the largest integer $n$ such that $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i \\leq n$.\n    *   $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$, which is $(10-1)=9$-connected.\n    *   The loop space operation $\\Omega$ reduces connectivity by 1. So, $B = \\Omega(S^{10})$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected.\n4.  **Connectivity of Source Space**: Use the same theorems to find the connectivity of $A$.\n    *   $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected. So, $c(S^4) = 3$ and $c(S^6) = 5$.\n    *   $c(\\Omega S^n) = c(S^n)-1$. So, $c(\\Omega S^4) = 2$ and $c(\\Omega S^6) = 4$.\n    *   For nice spaces (like CW complexes), $c(X \\wedge Y) = c(X) + c(Y) + 1$. So, $c(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7$.\n    *   The suspension operation $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by 1. So, $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1)=8$-connected.\n5.  **Analyze the Map on Homotopy Groups**:\n    *   Since both spaces are 8-connected, $\\pi_i(A) = \\pi_i(B) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$. The map is an isomorphism for $i \\le 8$.\n    *   Investigate $\\pi_9(f)$, the first non-trivial level.\n        *   Target: $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   Source: Using the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem and the Hurewicz Theorem, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Using the KÃ¼nneth theorem, this homology group is isomorphic to $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   The map on this level, $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$, is a well-known result from the theory of Whitehead and Samelson products, and it is an isomorphism of $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Investigate $\\pi_{10}(f)$.\n        *   Target: $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\pi_1^S = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (the first stable homotopy group of spheres).\n        *   Source: $\\pi_{10}(A) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. A calculation using the Whitehead sequence shows this group is 0.\n        *   The map $f_*: \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B)$ is the map $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$, which is not a surjection.\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The map $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i < 9$ and $i=9$.\n    *   The map $f_*$ is not a surjection for $i = 10$.\n    *   According to the definition, the connectivity is 9.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the connectivity of the map\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    It prints the step-by-step reasoning based on standard theorems\n    in algebraic topology.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Step 1: Problem Definition ###\")\n    print(\"We want to find the connectivity of the map:\")\n    print(\"f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\")\n    print(\"Let the source be A and the target be B.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe connectivity of a map f is the largest integer k such that f_* is an\")\n    print(\"isomorphism on homotopy groups pi_i for i < k and a surjection for i = k.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"### Step 2: Connectivity of Target Space B ###\")\n    s4_wedge_s6_conn = (4 - 1) + (6 - 1) + 1\n    print(\"The space S^4 wedge S^6 is homotopy equivalent to S^10.\")\n    print(\"Connectivity of S^n is n-1.
