Step-by-step Solution:

Part 1: The Knot Polynomial Calculation

The problem starts with the figure-eight knot's Jones polynomial, V(t).
A common form for this polynomial is V(t) = t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1 - t + t².
We are asked to find K, the value of this polynomial at t = -1.

K = V(-1) = (-1)⁻² - (-1)⁻¹ + 1 - (-1) + (-1)²

To satisfy the requirement to "output each number in the final equation," let's show the value of each term:
K = ({term1}) + ({term2}) + ({term3}) + ({term4}) + ({term5})
K = {K}

The absolute value is |K| = {abs_K}.
This gives us the integer range to consider: [1, {abs_K}].

Part 2: The Gödel Numbering Question

The question is: "how many Gödel numbers of true Π₁ statements about prime twins fall within this range?"

A Gödel numbering assigns a unique natural number to every statement in a formal system like arithmetic. A 'true Π₁ statement about prime twins' is a complex proposition. For example, a (false) Π₁ statement is "There are no twin primes," which is formally written as ∀n¬(IsPrime(n)∧IsPrime(n+2)).

In any standard Gödel numbering scheme, a statement's number is constructed from the numbers of its component symbols (∀, ¬, ∧, IsPrime, etc.). This process, often using prime exponentiation, results in extremely large numbers for any meaningful statement.

The numbers in our calculated range [1, {abs_K}] (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are far too small to encode a complete, syntactically correct logical statement. Such small numbers are typically used to represent the most basic symbols of the language itself (e.g., '0', '=', '+'), but never a full sentence.

Conclusion

No Gödel number for any 'true Π₁ statement about prime twins' can possibly fall into the range [1, 5]. Therefore, the count is zero.
