    Calculates the smallest possible number of elements in the subset Y.
    
    The problem can be reformulated in the dual space, where it becomes a known problem
    in finite geometry. Let n be the dimension of the main vector space (2023) and k
    be the dimension of the subspaces in X (2000). The dimension of the annihilator
    subspaces in the dual space is d = n - k.

    The question is equivalent to finding the smallest number m of d-dimensional
    subspaces U_i such that for any d-dimensional subspace U, the following holds:
    Intersection_{i=1 to m} (U + U_i) = U.

    The solution to this problem is m = ceil(n / d).
