    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Riddle**: I will break down the riddle into its three main descriptive parts.\n2.  **Analyze Each Part**:\n    *   \"A wooden stick\" clearly points to the Chinese character **木** (mù), which means wood or tree.\n    *   \"a square box\" refers to the enclosure radical **囗** (wéi).\n    *   \"a ladder placed in the center\" is the most figurative clue. The character **木** itself, with its central vertical stroke and intersecting horizontal/diagonal strokes, resembles a ladder. This \"ladder\" (木) is then \"placed in the center\" of the \"square box\" (囗).\n3.  **Synthesize the Character**: By placing the character for the \"wooden stick / ladder\" (木) inside the \"square box\" (囗), we form the final character.\n4.  **Create a Python Script**: I will write a simple Python script to print this explanation and reveal the final character, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the Chinese character riddle and prints the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    wooden_stick = \"木\"\n    square_box = \"囗\"\n    final_character = \"困\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the riddle step-by-step:\")\n    print(f\"1. 'A wooden stick' refers to the character: {wooden_stick}\")\n    print(f\"2. 'A square box' refers to the enclosure radical: {square_box}\")\n    print(f\"3. 'A ladder placed in the center' is a figurative description of the character '{wooden_stick}' being placed inside the '{square_box}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nBy placing the wooden stick (木) inside the square box (囗), we get the final character.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe character is:\")\n    print(final_character)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<困>>>"
