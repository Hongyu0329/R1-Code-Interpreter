# The problem is to find the constant 'b' in the asymptotic formula
# C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2) for the expected cover-and-return time on a random tree.
#
# Based on known results and a well-supported heuristic, the constant b
# is derived to be sqrt(2 * pi).
#
# The final equation is: b = sqrt(2 * pi)

# The numbers in the final equation
val_2 = 2
pi_val = math.pi

# Calculate b
b = math.sqrt(val_2 * pi_val)

# Output the equation and the values of its components
