    "Yes, if a Schwartz class function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has all its moments equal to zero, i.e., $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$, it logically follows that the function must be identically zero, $f(x) = 0$.\n\nMy plan to demonstrate this is to use the properties of the Fourier transform. The core idea is to show that the given condition implies that the Fourier transform of $f$, let's call it $\\hat{f}$, must have all its derivatives at the origin equal to zero. For a well-behaved function like one from the Schwartz class, this is enough to prove that the Fourier transform itself is the zero function. Since the Fourier transform is invertible, if $\\hat{f}=0$, then $f$ must also be zero. I will outline these steps in the Python code block below using print statements.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef explain_proof():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the proof that if all moments of a Schwartz function f(x) are zero, then f(x) must be zero.\n    The proof is presented step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"Problem: Suppose f(x) is a Schwartz class function such that integral(x^k * f(x) dx) = 0 for all k >= 0.
