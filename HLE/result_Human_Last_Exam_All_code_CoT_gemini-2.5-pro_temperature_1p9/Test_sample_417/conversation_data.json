    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Overall Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core. Three identical chiral substituents are attached at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule C3 rotational symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton signals within one arm and add them to the unique signals from the central core.\n\n2.  **Central Core and Linkers:**\n    *   **Aromatic Methyls:** The three methyl groups attached to the central benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Linkers (-CH2-):** There are three methylene groups linking the benzene ring to the substituents. These three groups are also equivalent due to C3 symmetry. However, each -CH2- group is adjacent to a chiral center (the large substituent). This makes the two protons on each methylene carbon diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n\n3.  **The Chiral Substituent:**\n    We will now analyze one of the identical `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl` groups. This group is derived from camphor and is chiral, with no internal symmetry. Therefore, every proton in a unique constitutional position will produce a separate signal.\n    *   **Indazole Proton (H-3):** There is one proton on the pyrazole-like ring. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton (H-4):** There is one proton at a bridgehead of the camphor-like skeleton. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (H-5 and H-6):** There are two -CH2- groups in the six-membered ring of the skeleton. The protons in each group are diastereotopic. This results in 2 signals from the H-5 protons and 2 signals from the H-6 protons, for a total of **4 signals**.\n    *   **Methyl Groups (7,8,8-trimethyl):** There are three methyl groups on the skeleton. One is on the C7 bridgehead, and two are geminal on the C8 bridge. Due to the chiral environment, all three methyl groups are chemically non-equivalent. This results in **3 signals**.\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    We sum the signals from all the unique environments.\n    *   From the core: 1 (Ar-CH3) + 2 (linker-CH2) = 3 signals.\n    *   From one substituent: 1 (H-3) + 1 (H-4) + 4 (H-5, H-6) + 3 (camphor CH3) = 9 signals.\n    *   Total = 3 + 9 = 12 signals.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints this breakdown.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Analyze the molecule's symmetry to determine equivalent parts.\n# 2. Count the number of unique proton signals from the central core and linkers.\n# 3. Count the number of unique proton signals from one of the identical chiral substituents.\n# 4. Sum the counts to get the total number of expected 1H NMR peaks.\n# 5. Print the detailed calculation and the final result.\n\n# Signals from the central core and linkers\n# The three methyl groups on the benzene ring are equivalent by C3 symmetry.\ncore_methyl_signals = 1\n# The three -CH2- linkers are equivalent, but the two protons on each\n# are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral group.\nlinker_ch2_signals = 2\n\n# Signals from one chiral substituent\n# This group is asymmetric, so most protons are unique.\n# Proton on the indazole ring\nindazole_h3_signal = 1\n# Proton at the bridgehead position\nbridgehead_h4_signal = 1\n# Diastereotopic protons on the two CH2 groups of the skeleton\nmethylene_signals = 4\n# Three non-equivalent methyl groups on the skeleton\ncamphor_methyl_signals = 3\n\n# Calculate the total number of signals\ntotal_signals = (core_methyl_signals +\n                 linker_ch2_signals +\n                 indazole_h3_signal +\n                 bridgehead_h4_signal +\n                 methylene_signals +\n                 camphor_methyl_signals)\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation as an equation\nprint(\"The total number of expected 1H NMR peaks is the sum of signals from each unique chemical environment:\")\nprint(f\"{core_methyl_signals} (core CH3) + {linker_ch2_signals} (linker CH2) + {indazole_h3_signal} (indazole H) + {bridgehead_h4_signal} (bridgehead H) + {methylene_signals} (skeleton CH2) + {camphor_methyl_signals} (skeleton CH3) = {total_signals}\")\n```\n<<<H>>>"
