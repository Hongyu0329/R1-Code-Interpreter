# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the molecule's symmetry to determine equivalent parts.
# 2. Count the number of unique proton signals from the central core and linkers.
# 3. Count the number of unique proton signals from one of the identical chiral substituents.
# 4. Sum the counts to get the total number of expected 1H NMR peaks.
# 5. Print the detailed calculation and the final result.

# Signals from the central core and linkers
# The three methyl groups on the benzene ring are equivalent by C3 symmetry.
core_methyl_signals = 1
# The three -CH2- linkers are equivalent, but the two protons on each
# are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral group.
linker_ch2_signals = 2

# Signals from one chiral substituent
# This group is asymmetric, so most protons are unique.
# Proton on the indazole ring
indazole_h3_signal = 1
# Proton at the bridgehead position
bridgehead_h4_signal = 1
# Diastereotopic protons on the two CH2 groups of the skeleton
methylene_signals = 4
# Three non-equivalent methyl groups on the skeleton
camphor_methyl_signals = 3

# Calculate the total number of signals
total_signals = (core_methyl_signals +
                 linker_ch2_signals +
                 indazole_h3_signal +
                 bridgehead_h4_signal +
                 methylene_signals +
                 camphor_methyl_signals)
