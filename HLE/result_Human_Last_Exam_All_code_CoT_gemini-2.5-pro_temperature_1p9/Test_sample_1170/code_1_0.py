    # First Answer: List of numbers corresponding to objects that generate a prime tt-ideal.
    # Based on the reasoning, the objects are:
    # - Generating P_p: 2, 4, 5, 6
    # - Generating P_1: 7, 15, 18
    # - Generating P_m: 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20

    # Second Answer: Number of prime tt-ideals not generated by any object on the list.
    # Since all three prime ideals (P_1, P_p, P_m) have generators in the list, this count is 0.
