# The task is to find the second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion
# for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field. This coefficient is typically
# denoted as a_2.

# 1. Theoretical background
# The heat kernel expansion for Tr(exp(-t*P)) for a second-order elliptic
# operator P is given by:
# Tr(exp(-t*P)) ~ (4*pi*t)^(-d/2) * sum_{n=0 to inf} t^n * a_n(P)
# Here, P = -D^2 where D is the Dirac operator.
# The coefficients a_n are integrals of local densities b_n(x),
# a_n = integral(b_n(x) dV).

# The second coefficient corresponds to n=1 (in this notation), i.e., a_1.
# Confusingly, this is often called a_2 in the context of spectral action
# (referring to the power of the cutoff scale). We will find the density
# of this coefficient.

# 2. Formulae
# For an operator P of the form P = laplacian + E, the density b_1(x) is:
# b_1(x) = Tr( (1/6)*R*I - E )
# where R is the scalar curvature and I is the identity operator.

# The Lichnerowicz formula gives us the operator P = -D^2 for a gauged Dirac
# field:
# P = laplacian + (1/4)*R*I + (1/2)*G_munu * sigma^munu
# So, the endomorphism E is E = (1/4)*R*I + (1/2)*G_munu * sigma^munu.
# The trace 'Tr' is over both the spinor and gauge representation spaces.

# 3. Calculation
# Let's substitute E into the formula for b_1(x):
# b_1(x) = Tr( (1/6)*R*I - ( (1/4)*R*I + (1/2)*G_munu * sigma^munu ) )
# b_1(x) = Tr( (1/6 - 1/4)*R*I - (1/2)*G_munu * sigma^munu )
# b_1(x) = Tr( (-1/12)*R*I ) - Tr( (1/2)*G_munu * sigma^munu )

# The trace is Tr = tr_spinor * tr_gauge.
# Let d be the spacetime dimension. Dimension of spinor representation d_S = 2**(d/2).
# Let N be the dimension of the gauge group representation.
# The first term gives:
# - (1/12) * R * tr_spinor(I) * tr_gauge(I) = - (1/12) * R * d_S * N

# The second term contains tr_spinor(sigma^munu). Since sigma^munu is proportional
# to the commutator [gamma^mu, gamma^nu], its trace is zero. So the second
# term vanishes.
# Tr( (1/2)*G_munu * sigma^munu ) = (1/2) * tr_gauge(G_munu) * tr_spinor(sigma^munu) = 0.

# Thus, the final density is b_1(x) = - (d_S * N / 12) * R(x).

# 4. Final expression for d=4 spacetime
d = 4
d_S = 2**(d // 2)  # d_S = 4 for d=4
# The density is - (4 * N / 12) * R = - (1/3) * N * R.
