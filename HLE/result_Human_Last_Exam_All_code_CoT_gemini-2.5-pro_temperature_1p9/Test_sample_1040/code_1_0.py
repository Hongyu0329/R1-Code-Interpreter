  This function prints the comma-separated string of the numbers for which the equation is true.
  The reasoning is provided in the thoughts section.
  Based on the step-by-step analysis of the mathematical properties, the following identities were found to be necessarily true:
  4. (klm).Φ(k) = 0
  6. k.Φ²(l;m) = 0
  7. (lm).Φ²(k;m) = 0
  8. (klm).Φ²(k;l) = 0
  10. k.Φ³(k;l;m) = 0
  11. (lm).Φ³(k;l;m) = 0
  12. (klm).Φ³(k;l;m) = 0
  
  The function will print these numbers as a comma-separated string.
