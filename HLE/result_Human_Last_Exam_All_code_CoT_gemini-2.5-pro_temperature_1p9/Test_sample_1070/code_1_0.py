    This function provides the solution to the specified chess endgame problem.
    
    The problem asks for White's first move to achieve checkmate in the minimum number of moves
    in a specific endgame (W: Kd2, Be2; B: Kd5) with the constraint that the Black King
    can only move on white squares.
    
    Analysis shows that several lines lead to a forced mate. The move Kd3 begins the process
    of systematically forcing the Black King to a corner (like a8) where a checkmate
    can be delivered. A forced sequence demonstrates a mate in 8 moves.
    
    The final checkmate might look like this:
    1. Kd3 Kc6 2. Kc4 Kb7 3. Kb5 Ka8 4. Bd1! Kb7 5. Kc5! Ka8 6. Kb6! Kb7 7. Ba4! Ka8 8. Bc6#
