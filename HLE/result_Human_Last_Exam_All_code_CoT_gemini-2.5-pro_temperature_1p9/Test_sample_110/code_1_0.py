# Plan:
# 1. Determine the ideal folded configuration that gives the shortest distance, ignoring collisions.
#    The configuration L1 - L2 - L3 - L4 gives an ideal distance of 13 cm.
# 2. This ideal 1D configuration has collisions (e.g., S1 overlaps S3).
# 3. To fix this, we create a 2D model, separating colliding segments by a height 'h'.
# 4. We find the minimum 'h' required to satisfy all non-adjacent collision constraints (1 cm clearance).
#    A key constraint emerges between segments S2 and S4, which requires h >= L2 / L3.
# 5. We calculate the final coordinates and distance using this minimum height.
