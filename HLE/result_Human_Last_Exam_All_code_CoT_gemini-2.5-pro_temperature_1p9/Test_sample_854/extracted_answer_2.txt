The laboratory made a mistake by believing their Quality Control (QC) results were valid. The QC test seemed to pass, but it failed to detect the crucial underlying error: the antibiotic chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed when it was added *before* the high-heat autoclaving process. This gave the lab a false sense of security, and they used the non-selective media which was then susceptible to airborne bacterial contamination.
