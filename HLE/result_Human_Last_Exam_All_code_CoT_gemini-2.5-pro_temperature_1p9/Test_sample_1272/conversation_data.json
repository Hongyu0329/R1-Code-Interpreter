    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the historical context of Ming General Mu Sheng's campaigns in Vietnam.\n2.  I will then pinpoint the specific battle that is recognized as his first significant and personal defeat.\n3.  Next, I will determine the location of this historical battle according to historical records.\n4.  Finally, I will map this historical location to a current Vietnamese province and write a Python script to print the name of that province.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n1.  Ming General Mu Sheng was involved in the Ming dynasty's campaigns in Vietnam, particularly during the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi (1418–1427).\n2.  While he was involved in the war for many years, his first major, personal defeat in a large-scale engagement occurred in 1427. He was leading one of two massive Ming relief armies sent to quell the rebellion.\n3.  His army, advancing from Yunnan, was ambushed and decisively defeated at the Battle of Lãnh Câu (隘冷勾) and Đan Xá (丹舍).\n4.  These historical locations, Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá, are situated in the region that corresponds to the modern-day Thanh Hóa Province in Vietnam. This defeat was crucial as it led to the retreat and eventual collapse of his entire army.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    general = \"Mu Sheng\"\n    # The decisive battle where Mu Sheng's army was defeated was the Battle of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in 1427.\n    battle = \"Battle of Lanh Cau and Dan Xa\"\n    # Historical records place this battle in the region of modern-day Thanh Hóa Province.\n    province = \"Thanh Hóa Province\"\n    \n    print(f\"General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred during the {battle}.\")\n    print(f\"This battle took place in the region that is now known as the current Vietnamese province of: {province}\")\n\nfind_defeat_location()\n```\n<<<Thanh Hóa Province>>>"
