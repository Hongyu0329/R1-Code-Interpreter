    "To determine the oligomeric state of these coiled-coil protein sequences, we will analyze the amino acids at the core positions of the heptad repeat. In a standard coiled-coil, the seven amino acid positions are labeled 'a' through 'g'. The 'a' and 'd' positions form the hydrophobic core, and the identity of the amino acids at these positions is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Assume a standard heptad register (`gabcdef`) for each 28-amino-acid sequence. This means 'a' residues are at positions 2, 9, 16, 23, and 'd' residues are at positions 5, 12, 19, 26.\n2.  For each sequence, I will extract the amino acids at these 'a' and 'd' positions.\n3.  I will apply a set of well-established rules to predict the oligomeric state based on these core residues:\n    *   **Dimer (2):** Strongly favored by Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position. Isoleucine at 'a' is a particularly strong indicator for dimerization.\n    *   **Trimer (3):** Often formed with Leucine (L) at 'a' and Isoleucine (I) at 'd'. Bulky residues like Tryptophan (W) at a 'd' position also strongly promote a trimeric state.\n    *   **Tetramer (4):** Strongly favored by Isoleucine (I) at both the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n4.  Finally, I will assemble the predictions for all five sequences and determine the correct answer choice.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the first two steps of the plan, extracting the key residues for our analysis. The subsequent reasoning for each prediction will be provided in the print statements.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coils():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes coiled-coil sequences to predict their oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequences = [\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Heptad positions (0-indexed)\n    # Register g-a-b-c-d-e-f\n    # 'a' is at index 1, 8, 15, 22\n    # 'd' is at index 4, 11, 18, 25\n    a_indices = [1, 8, 15, 22]\n    d_indices = [4, 11, 18, 25]\n\n    predictions = []\n    \n    # --- Sequence 1 ---\n    seq1 = sequences[0]\n    a_res1 = [seq1[i] for i in a_indices]\n    d_res1 = [seq1[i] for i in d_indices]\n    print(f\"Sequence 1: {seq1}\")\n    print(f\"  'a' positions: {a_res1}\")\n    print(f\"  'd' positions: {d_res1}\")\n    # Reasoning: 'a' positions are all Isoleucine (I), a very strong dimer signal.\n    # 'd' positions are mostly Alanine (A), which is also compatible with a dimer.\n    # The single bulky Tryptophan (W) at a 'd' position is not sufficient to overcome\n    # the strong dimeric preference of the three I-A pairs.\n    pred1 = 2\n    predictions.append(pred1)\n    print(f\"Prediction: Dimer ({pred1})\\n\")\n\n    # --- Sequence 2 ---\n    seq2 = sequences[1]\n    a_res2 = [seq2[i] for i in a_indices]\n    d_res2 = [seq2[i] for i in d_indices]\n    print(f\"Sequence 2: {seq2}\")\n    print(f\"  'a' positions: {a_res2}\")\n    print(f\"  'd' positions: {d_res2}\")\n    # Reasoning: This is a classic dimer-forming sequence.
