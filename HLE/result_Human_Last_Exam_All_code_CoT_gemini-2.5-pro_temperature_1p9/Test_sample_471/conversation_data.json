    "The problem of finding the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a manifold is a classic application of Morse theory. The theory connects the number of critical points of a function to the topological properties of its domain.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the topology:** The domain is the 2-torus, $T^2$. We will determine its topological invariants, specifically its Betti numbers. The Betti numbers ($b_k$) count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions.\n2.  **Apply Morse Theory:** The Morse inequalities state that for a special type of function called a Morse function, the number of critical points of a certain type (index $k$, denoted $c_k$) is at least the corresponding Betti number ($c_k \\ge b_k$).\n3.  **Sum the minima:** The total number of critical points for a smooth function is at least the sum of the Betti numbers, $\\sum b_k$. This gives us a lower bound for the number of critical points.\n4.  **Confirm the bound:** We confirm that this theoretical minimum is achievable by providing a concrete example of a function on the torus that has exactly this many critical points.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through the calculation based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    f: T^2 -> R using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2).\n    # The Betti numbers are topological invariants of a space.\n    # b_0: number of connected components.
