    "To solve this, we need to understand how logical qubits are encoded in a surface code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the encoding rule:** In a planar patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is equal to the number of holes (or defects) created within that patch.\n2.  **Analyze the components:** The problem specifies we have two separate patches of surface code. Since they are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n3.  **Calculate qubits per patch:** The problem states there are two holes. The most common interpretation is that each of the two patches has two holes. Therefore, each patch can encode 2 logical qubits.\n4.  **Calculate the total:** With two patches each encoding 2 logical qubits, the total is the sum, which is equivalent to multiplying the number of patches by the qubits per patch.\n5.  **Construct the code:** Write a Python script to perform this simple calculation and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubit_encoding():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for the given surface code configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of separate patches of surface code.\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # The number of holes in each individual patch.\n    # In a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits equals the number of holes.\n    holes_per_patch = 2\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = holes_per_patch\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each independent patch.\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"A single patch of planar surface code with {holes_per_patch} holes can encode {logical_qubits_per_patch} logical qubits.\")\n    print(f\"Since there are {num_patches} independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum from each patch.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_patches} (patches) * {logical_qubits_per_patch} (logical qubits per patch) = {total_logical_qubits} (total logical qubits)\")\n\nsolve_qubit_encoding()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
