# The problem asks for the assumptions necessary to prove that for a Bayesian agent,
# the expected information gain approaches zero over time.
#
# Let's analyze the options:
# a. The prior has finite entropy: The total expected information an agent can gain
#    is bounded by the entropy of its prior distribution. If the prior entropy is finite,
#    the sum of all expected information gains over time must also be finite. For a sum
#    of non-negative terms (information gain is always non-negative) to be finite,
#    the terms must approach zero. This is a very strong and general argument that
#    makes this assumption sufficient. It is also generally considered necessary, as infinite
#    prior entropy would allow for potentially infinite learning.
#
# b. The MDP has a finite/compact state space: This is a structural assumption on the
#    environment. While helpful for many proofs in RL (e.g., regret bounds), the convergence
#    of information gain is a more fundamental property of the Bayesian update rule itself,
#    which is limited by the initial uncertainty (prior entropy), not the size of the world.
#
# c. The state occupancy distribution converges: This is an assumption about the agent's
#    long-term behavior. While a stabilizing policy can aid learning convergence, it's not
#    the core requirement for information gain to cease. The agent is limited by what it
#    doesn't know (prior entropy), not by whether its behavior is stable.
#
# d. Observations are sampled i.i.d.: This is a major simplifying assumption that is not
#    true for an agent whose actions influence its observations. The result holds more generally.
#
# e. The entropy of the posterior approaches zero: This is a possible consequence of learning,
#    not a prerequisite assumption. The information gain can go to zero even if the posterior
#    remains uncertain (e.g., if multiple models become indistinguishable).
#
# Conclusion: The key necessary assumption is (a), as it provides a finite "budget"
# of uncertainty to be reduced.
#
# The answer in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for a single clause 'a' is [(a)].

# The instruction asks to use the print function for the output.
# The question "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# is likely a misplaced generic instruction, as there are no numbers or equations in the logical formula.
# I will print the final logical formula as requested.

sys.stdout = original_stdout
# Get the captured output
output = captured_output.getvalue()

# You can now process the output as needed, but for this task,
# we will just print it to the user.
# (The primary output of the code block will be what's needed for the platform)
# This redirection is just to conform to the user prompt's style.
