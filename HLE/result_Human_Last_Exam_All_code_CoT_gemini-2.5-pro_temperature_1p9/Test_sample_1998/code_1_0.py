# Step 1: Define the u-invariant for the base field.
# The base field is the residue field of the residue field of K, which is a finite
# field of characteristic 2, F_q where q = 2^n.
# For any finite field, the u-invariant is 2.
u_finite_field = 2
print(f"The u-invariant of the finite residue field F_q is {u_finite_field}.")

# Step 2: Compute the u-invariant of the residue field of K.
# The residue field of K is a local field of characteristic 2, k = F_q((t)).
# By Springer's theorem, u(k) = 2 * u(F_q).
u_residue_field = 2 * u_finite_field
print(f"The u-invariant of the residue field k = F_q((t)) is 2 * {u_finite_field} = {u_residue_field}.")

# Step 3: Compute the u-invariant of the field K.
# The field K is a complete discretely valued field with residue field k.
# By Springer's theorem again, u(K) = 2 * u(k).
u_K = 2 * u_residue_field
print(f"The u-invariant of the field K is 2 * {u_residue_field} = {u_K}.")

# The smallest natural number N with the given property is equal to the u-invariant of K.
N = u_K
print(f"\nThe smallest natural number N is {N}.")
