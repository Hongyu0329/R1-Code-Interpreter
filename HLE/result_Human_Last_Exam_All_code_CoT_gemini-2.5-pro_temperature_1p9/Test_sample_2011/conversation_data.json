    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The core task is to determine the maximum number of distinct clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph of `n=128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Concepts:**\n    *   An **induced subgraph** `G[V']` on a subset of vertices `V'` contains all edges from the original graph `G` that connect vertices within `V'`.\n    *   A **clique** is a set of vertices where every two vertices are connected. A clique of size `k` is denoted `K_k`.\n    *   If a set of `k` vertices forms a clique in `G`, the subgraph induced by these vertices is automatically a `K_k`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship:** I will demonstrate that for any given graph `G`, the set of sizes of its induced cliques is always a consecutive sequence of integers starting from 1. Specifically, if the largest clique in `G` has size `ω(G)` (this is called the clique number), then the set of all possible induced clique sizes is precisely `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`. This is because any subset of a clique is also a clique.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Problem:** Based on the above point, the problem of maximizing the *number* of different clique sizes becomes equivalent to maximizing the *size* of the largest possible clique, `ω(G)`.\n\n5.  **Solve the Maximization Problem:** The task is now to find the maximum clique number `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with 128 vertices. A clique is a subset of the graph's vertices, so its size cannot exceed the total number of vertices. The maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_128`, where all 128 vertices form a single giant clique.\n\n6.  **Finalize the Answer:** For `n=128`, the maximum clique size is 128. Therefore, the maximum number of different clique sizes is also 128. I will write a Python script that explains this logic and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph\n    on n = 128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the problem.\")\n    print(f\"We have a graph G with n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the maximum number of different values of 'k' such that an induced K_k (a clique of size k) exists in G.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the set of clique sizes.\")\n    print(\"Let ω(G) be the 'clique number' of G, which is the size of the largest clique in G.\")\n    print(\"If a graph G has a clique of size ω(G), let's call the set of its vertices 'C'.\")\n    print(\"Any subset of C of size 'k' (where 1 <= k <= ω(G)) will also form a clique.\")\n    print(\"The subgraph induced by such a k-subset is a K_k.\")\n    print(\"This means that if ω(G) is the size of the largest clique, the graph G must contain induced cliques of all sizes: 1, 2, ..., ω(G).\")\n    print(\"So, the number of different clique sizes in any graph G is equal to its clique number, ω(G).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Reframing the problem.\")\n    print(\"To maximize the number of different clique sizes, we need to find a graph G that maximizes the clique number ω(G).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Solving the simplified problem.\")\n    print(f\"For a graph with n = {n} vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum possible clique number is {n}.\")\n    print(f\"This maximum is achieved by the complete graph, K_{n}, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 5: Final Conclusion and Calculation.\")\n    # The final equation is simply that the maximum number of sizes equals the number of vertices.\n    max_number_of_sizes = n\n    \n    print(f\"The graph K_{n} on n = {n} vertices has a clique number of {n}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, it contains induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, ..., {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of different clique sizes is {n}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: max_sizes = n\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: max_sizes = {max_number_of_sizes}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_clique_sizes()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
