# The size of the vocabulary and the length of the sequence
n = 99

# As derived from the mathematical analysis, the sum S is given by the formula:
# S = (n + 1)^(n - 1)

# For n = 99, we substitute the value into the formula.
base = n + 1
exponent = n - 1
# The result is 100^98.

# The problem asks to write the answer as a power of 10.
# We know that 100 = 10^2.
# So, S = (10^2)^98 = 10^(2 * 98) = 10^196.

power_of_10 = 2 * 98
