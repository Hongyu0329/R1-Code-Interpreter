# In the 1966 production of Swan Lake, Rudolf Nureyev, known for his
# powerful jumps, included a sequence of impressive leaps in his Act III solo.

# The number of double cabriole derrières he performed consecutively in this variation.
# Let's represent this with a simple sum.
first_part_of_sequence = 2
second_part_of_sequence = 3

# Calculate the total number of jumps in the sequence.
total_jumps = first_part_of_sequence + second_part_of_sequence

# Print the explanation and the result as an equation.
