    "This puzzle relies on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Core Pattern:** The primary sequence of letters, `Z, X, C, V, B, N`, corresponds to the first six letters on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard, read from left to right.\n2.  **Identify the \"Intruder\" Letters:** There are two letters in the sequence, the second `X` and the `Y`, that do not fit this primary pattern. These appear to be extra letters inserted into the main sequence.\n3.  **Determine the Next Letter:** The main pattern is the progression along the keyboard's bottom row. The sequence given (`ZXXCVYBN`) ends on `N`, which is the 6th letter of that row. The next letter in the core pattern is the 7th letter on that row.\n4.  **Write Code to Verify:** I will write a Python script that codifies this logic. The script will have the keyboard's bottom row as a reference. It will step through the input sequence, matching characters against the reference to find the next logical character in the pattern.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the letter sequence puzzle by comparing it to the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sequence of letters provided by the user.\n    sequence = \"ZXXCVYBN\"\n\n    # The reference sequence is the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n    keyboard_bottom_row = \"ZXCVBNM\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the sequence:\", sequence)\n    print(\"The underlying pattern appears to be the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\")\n    print(\"Keyboard reference:\", keyboard_bottom_row)\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Verifying the pattern step-by-step:\")\n\n    # Create an iterator for the keyboard row to track the expected letter.\n    keyboard_iter = iter(keyboard_bottom_row)\n    \n    # This will hold the next character we expect to see from the keyboard pattern.\n    next_expected_char_in_pattern = next(keyboard_iter)\n\n    # We iterate through the provided sequence to see how it matches the keyboard row.\n    for char_in_sequence in sequence:\n        # Check if the character from the input sequence matches the expected pattern character.\n        if char_in_sequence == next_expected_char_in_pattern:\n            print(f\"- '{char_in_sequence}' : Matches the expected pattern character '{next_expected_char_in_pattern}'.\")\n            # If it matches, we look for the next character in the keyboard row.\n            try:\n                next_expected_char_in_pattern = next(keyboard_iter)\n            except StopIteration:\n                # This case is for when the sequence finishes the entire keyboard row.\n                next_expected_char_in_pattern = \"[End of Reference]\"\n        else:\n            # If it doesn't match, it's an extra character not part of the primary pattern.\n            print(f\"- '{char_in_sequence}' : Does not match expected '{next_expected_char_in_pattern}'.
