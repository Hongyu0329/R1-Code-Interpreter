    # Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
    # Analysis:
    # 1. Compound 11, cis-2-butene-1,4-diol (HO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OH), has a 4-carbon backbone.
    # 2. The text describes "ozonolysis of the double bond". This reaction cleaves the C2=C3 double bond, breaking the 4-carbon molecule into two identical 2-carbon fragments (aldehyde 12).
    # 3. The synthesis proceeds using one of these 2-carbon fragments.
    # 4. Subsequent steps (Henry reaction, Michael addition, Wittig, Nef, RCM, etc.) build upon this 2-carbon unit but do not break its C-C bond.
    # 5. Therefore, the 2 carbons from the initial fragment of compound 11 are retained all the way to the final product, compound 1.
    carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

    # Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
    # Analysis:
    # 1. Compound 11, a diol, has two oxygen atoms, one in each -OH group.
    # 2. After ozonolysis, each 2-carbon fragment (aldehyde 12) contains the carbon backbone and one of the original oxygen atoms (which is protected as a TES ether, -OTES).
    # 3. This protected oxygen atom is not affected by the subsequent reactions leading to compound 10, then 7, then 13, and finally 14.
    # 4. The text mentions the TES group is removed later in the synthesis to yield compound 15 from 14. This means compound 14 still possesses the TES-protected oxygen.
    # 5. Therefore, compound 14 contains 1 oxygen atom that originated from compound 11.
    oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

    # Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
    # Analysis:
    # 1. The synthetic sequence is 12 -> 10 -> 7. Compound 10 is a precursor to compound 7.
    # 2. Compound 10 is formed using MeNO2 (nitromethane), introducing one nitrogen atom into the molecule as a nitro group (-NO2).
    # 3. Compound 7 is formed by the reaction of compound 10 with compound 6. No other nitrogen-containing reagents are added, so compound 7 also contains that same single nitrogen atom.
    # 4. The question is "How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?". This is phrased in reverse of the synthetic flow. The logical interpretation is to count the number of nitrogen atoms in compound 7 that can be traced back to compound 10.
    # 5. Since compound 7's single nitrogen atom comes directly from compound 10, the answer is 1.
    nitrogens_from_7_in_10 = 1

    # The final answer requires printing the three numbers separated by commas.
    print(f"{carbons_from_11_in_1},{oxygens_from_11_in_14},{nitrogens_from_7_in_10}")
