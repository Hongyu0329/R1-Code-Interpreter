# This script analyzes measures to mitigate automation bias in AI-assisted teaching.
# Automation bias is the over-reliance on automated systems.
# We will evaluate each option to see if it encourages critical thinking (reduces bias)
# or encourages passive acceptance (does not reduce bias).

# Let's represent the options and their logical impact on bias.
# A True value means the measure is likely to reduce bias.
# A False value means it will NOT reduce bias.
