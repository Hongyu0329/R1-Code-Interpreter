# The graph is obtained from C_100 by replacing each edge with a set of parallel edges.
# The number of parallel edges for each original edge is given.
m = 1234

# C_100 is a cycle with 100 vertices. Since 100 is an even number, C_100 is a bipartite graph.
# Replacing edges with parallel edges results in a bipartite multigraph.

# For a bipartite multigraph M, a known theorem states that its correspondence chromatic number
# is determined by the maximum multiplicity (number of parallel edges between any two vertices)
# over all edges in the graph. The formula is: max_multiplicity + 1.

# In this problem, the multiplicity for all edges is uniformly 1234.
# So, the maximum multiplicity is m.
max_multiplicity = m

# Calculate the correspondence chromatic number using the formula.
correspondence_chromatic_number = max_multiplicity + 1

# Print the explanation and the final equation.
