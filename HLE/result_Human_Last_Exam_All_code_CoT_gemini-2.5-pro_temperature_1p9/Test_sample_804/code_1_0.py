# Final Answer Rationale:
# The core of the problem lies in the extremely tight constraints of the Titan computer,
# specifically that all numbers are fractions of 5-bit integers (0-31) and that
# intermediate calculations must not exceed this limit.
#
# Let's analyze the simplified formula for the force:
# F ≈ (4/3) * π * G * R_total * ρ_shell * m_probe
#
# To compute this, we would need to multiply the fractional representations of these values.
# Let's consider just one part of this calculation: including the probe's mass (m_probe = 30 kg).
# In Titan's architecture, this would be represented as the fraction 30/1.
#
# Now, let's try to multiply this by any other term in the formula, for instance, (4/3).
# The operation would be (4/3) * (30/1).
# According to the problem's rules (inferred from the example "78/5" being unrepresentable),
# the intermediate products must remain within the 5-bit range.
# The numerator of this product would be 4 * 30 = 120.
#
# Since 120 is far greater than 31 (the maximum value for a 5-bit integer), this
# single operation is impossible to perform on Titan.
#
# This issue persists regardless of the order of operations or the specific approximations
# chosen for constants like π and G. The presence of a term like `30/1` makes chained
# multiplication computationally impossible under the given constraints.
#
# The provided workarounds (approximation and decomposition) cannot resolve this fundamental
# limitation without introducing massive errors that would render the result meaningless, or
# they still lead to invalid operations down the line.
#
# Therefore, it is not possible to use Titan to solve this problem.
