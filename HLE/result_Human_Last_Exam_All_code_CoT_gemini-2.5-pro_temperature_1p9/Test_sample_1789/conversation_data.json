    "This problem asks for the size of the largest set of divisors of `N = 823564528378596` that can be formed by the union of 20 antichains.\n\n### **Methodology**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:** The core of this problem lies in a concept from poset theory. A set is a union of `k` antichains if and only if it does not contain a chain of length `k+1`. In our case, we are looking for the largest subset of divisors of `N` that does not contain a chain of `20 + 1 = 21` elements. A chain is a sequence of divisors `d_1, d_2, ..., d_L` such that `d_1` divides `d_2`, `d_2` divides `d_3`, and so on.\n\n2.  **Prime Factorization:** The structure of the divisor poset depends entirely on the prime factorization of `N`. Let `N = p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_m^{a_m}`.\n    The number `N = 823564528378596` has the following prime factorization:\n    `N = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^1 * 13^1 * 17^1 * 19^1 * 23^1 * 29^1 * 31^1 * 37^1 * 41^1 * 43^1`\n    The exponents are `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Longest Chain:** The length of the longest chain in the divisor poset of `N` is given by `1 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_m`.\n    For our number `N`, the sum of exponents is `2 + 2 + 10 * 1 = 14`.\n    Therefore, the length of the longest chain is `1 + 14 = 15`.\n\n4.  **Comparing Chain Lengths:** We are looking for the largest set of divisors that does not contain a chain of length 21. Since the longest possible chain in the entire set of divisors is only 15, no subset of divisors (including the full set) can possibly contain a chain of length 21.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** This means the condition of \"not containing a chain of length 21\" is always met. The largest possible subset is therefore the entire set of all divisors of `N`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Total Number of Divisors:** The total number of divisors of `N` is calculated by the formula `d(N) = (a_1+1) * (a_2+1) * ... * (a_m+1)`.\n    Using the exponents we found, this is: `(2+1) * (2+1) * (1+1)^10`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and displays the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset of N.\n\n    This is equivalent to the total number of divisors of N, as the longest chain\n    in the poset is shorter than 21.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The prime factorization of N = 823564528378596 is\n    # 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^1 * 13^1 * 17^1 * 19^1 * 23^1 * 29^1 * 31^1 * 37^1 * 41^1 * 43^1.\n    exponents = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    # The total number of divisors is (a1+1)*(a2+1)*...\n    terms = [exp + 1 for exp in exponents]\n\n    # Calculate the result\n    result = 1\n    for term in terms:\n        result *= term\n\n    # Build the equation string\n    equation_parts = [f\"({exp}+1)\" for exp in exponents]\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"The size of the largest union of 20 antichains is the total number of divisors.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {equation_str} = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<9216>>>"
