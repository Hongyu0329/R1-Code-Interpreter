    Calculates the minimum number of particles N to form a rank-7 pseudo-tensor.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. A pseudo-tensor is formed using the Levi-Civita symbol (ε), a rank-3 pseudo-tensor.
    2. To achieve a rank-7 pseudo-tensor, we combine ε with a regular tensor of rank 4
       (since 3 + 4 = 7).
    3. A rank-4 regular tensor can be formed from an even number of polar vectors, e.g., v⊗v⊗v⊗v.
    4. To form one polar vector (v = r_2 - r_1) that is translationally invariant,
       at least 2 particles are needed.
