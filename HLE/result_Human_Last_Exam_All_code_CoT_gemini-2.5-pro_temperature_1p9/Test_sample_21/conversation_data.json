    "To solve this problem, we need to find the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let's denote this group by $G$.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ that act as a single cycle of length 7 (a 7-cycle) on the roots of $f(x)$.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  **Determine properties of the Galois group G.** We will show that $f(x)$ is irreducible, which implies $G$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. Then, we'll compute the discriminant of $f(x)$ to determine if $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_7$.\n2.  **Constrain the possibilities for G.** We will analyze the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo some unramified primes. The degrees of the irreducible factors correspond to the lengths of the cycles in the permutation of the corresponding Frobenius element in $G$. This will allow us to rule out most of the possible transitive subgroups of $S_7$.\n3.  **Identify G.** The evidence will point to a unique choice for $G$ from the list of transitive subgroups of $S_7$.\n4.  **Calculate the final density.** Once $G$ is known, we can count the number of 7-cycles in it and divide by the total number of elements in $G$ to get the required density.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the necessary computations for this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Symbol, Poly\nfrom sympy.ntheory import is_square\n\ndef analyze_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the polynomial f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22\n    to determine the natural density of primes p for which it is irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = Symbol('x')\n    f_poly = Poly(x**7 - 14*x**5 + 56*x**3 - 56*x + 22, x, domain='ZZ')\n\n    # Introduction\n    print(\"The natural density of primes p for which a polynomial is irreducible mod p is\")\n    print(\"given by the proportion of n-cycles in its Galois group G, where n is the polynomial's degree.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check irreducibility over Q.\n    # We use Eisenstein's criterion with p=2.
