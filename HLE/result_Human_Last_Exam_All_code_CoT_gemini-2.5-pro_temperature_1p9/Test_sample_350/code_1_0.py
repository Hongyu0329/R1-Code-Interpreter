    explanation = """To answer the question, we must identify the two thinkers whose ideas form the foundation for Wolfhart Pannenberg's concepts of "cosmic history" and "contingent time."

1.  **Georg Hegel:** The text's focus on a grand "reinterpretation of history" and a "theology of history" is a clear indicator of Pannenberg's deep and critical engagement with Georg Hegel. Hegel's philosophy is famous for positing that the Absolute Spirit realizes itself through the rational, unfolding process of world history. Pannenberg adapts this Hegelian framework for his own theological purposes, arguing that God is revealed throughout the whole of history, with its ultimate meaning disclosed from its future end.

2.  **Friedrich Schelling:** The text also emphasizes a "contingent concept of time" as the foundation of Pannenberg's cosmic history. This points to the influence of Friedrich Schelling, another major German Idealist. Schelling's later philosophy, particularly his exploration of freedom, potentiality, and a God who is not static but deeply involved in the contingent processes of creation ("the ages of the world"), provides a crucial philosophical basis for Pannenberg's model of a contingent universe and a future-oriented God.

Based on these two key influences, the correct pairing is George Hegel and Friedrich Schelling."""
