def find_welding_parameters():
    """
    This function determines the appropriate TIG welding parameters based on the problem description.
    
    Analysis:
    1. Arc Gap and Voltage: A large 6 mm arc gap requires a high voltage to be sustained. 
       Of the choices, 15 V and 17.5 V are the most plausible.
    2. Heat Input (Current): Repairing a thin Inconel blade tip at a very slow travel speed 
       (0.5 mm/s) requires low heat input to avoid damage. This necessitates a low amperage. 
       25 A is a suitable low current, whereas 80A, 100A, or 150A are too high and would likely 
       damage the blade.
    3. Conclusion: The combination of a low current (25 A) for delicate work and a high voltage 
       (17.5 V) for the large arc gap is the only logical choice.
