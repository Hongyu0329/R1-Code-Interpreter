    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The task is to find `a(10)`, which represents the total number of self-avoiding walks of 10 steps on a 2D square lattice (Manhattan lattice), starting from the origin. A self-avoiding walk is a path on the lattice that never visits the same point more than once.\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm**: This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using a backtracking algorithm. We can start a walk from the origin (0,0) and recursively explore all possible paths.\n3.  **Implement the Backtracking Function**:\n    *   I'll create a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks(x, y, steps_left, visited_path)`.\n    *   This function will keep track of the current `(x, y)` position, the number of `steps_left`, and a `set` of `visited_path` points for efficient lookup.\n    *   **Base Case**: If `steps_left` is 0, it means we've successfully found a valid 10-step walk, so we return 1.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: For the current point `(x, y)`, we'll try to move in all four directions (up, down, left, right). If a move leads to a point that has not been visited yet, we'll recursively call the function for that new point with one fewer step `(steps_left - 1)`.\n    *   The function will sum the results from all valid recursive calls to get the total number of walks from the current state.\n4.  **Initial Call**: The process starts from the origin (0,0) with 10 steps to take. The initial `visited_path` will only contain the origin `{(0,0)}`.\n5.  **Final Output**: The code will call the function and print the final result in the format `a(10) = result`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of steps for the walk.\n    N = 10\n\n    # It's possible for the recursion to go deep. We can increase the Python's\n    # recursion limit, although the default is usually sufficient for N=10.\n    # sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n    # Use a set for the visited path for efficient O(1) lookups.\n    visited_path = set()\n\n    def count_walks(x, y, steps_left):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks using backtracking.\n\n        Args:\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have found one valid path.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        # Add the current point to the visited path.\n        visited_path.add((x, y))\n\n        # Initialize the count of walks from this point.\n        walk_count = 0\n\n        # Define the four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice.\n        moves = [(0, 1),  # Up\n                 (0, -1), # Down\n                 (1, 0),  # Right\n                 (-1, 0)] # Left\n\n        # Explore each possible move.\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # If the next point has not been visited, explore from there.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited_path:\n                walk_count += count_walks(next_x, next_y, steps_left - 1)\n\n        # Backtrack: Remove the current point from the path so it can be\n        # visited by other branches of the search.\n        visited_path.remove((x, y))\n\n        return walk_count\n\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0,0).\n    start_x, start_y = 0, 0\n\n    # The initial call to the function to count all walks of length N.\n    total_walks = count_walks(start_x, start_y, N)\n\n    # The provided prompt specifies an unusual output format for the \"final equation\"\n    # The clearest way to present this is to show the value of a(10).\n    print(f\"a({N}) = {total_walks}\")\n\n\nsolve_saw_count()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
