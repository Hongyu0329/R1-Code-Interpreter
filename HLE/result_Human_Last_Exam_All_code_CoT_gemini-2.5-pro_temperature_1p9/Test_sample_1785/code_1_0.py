# This program calculates the minimum total number of edges for a 
# topologically nontrivial link with three components on a 3D integer lattice.

# Step 1: Identify the simplest configuration for a nontrivial 3-component link.
# This consists of a minimal 2-component link (a Hopf link) and a minimal
# third component (an unknot) that is not linked to the other two.

# Step 2: State the known minimal edge counts for these components on the Z^3 lattice.
# The minimal edge count for a Hopf link is 12.
min_edges_hopf_link = 12

# The minimal edge count for an unknot (a simple square) is 4.
min_edges_unknot = 4

# Step 3: Calculate the total minimum edges by summing the component edges.
total_min_edges = min_edges_hopf_link + min_edges_unknot

# Step 4: Print the final calculation, showing each number in the equation.
print(f"The minimal number of edges for a nontrivial 3-component link is found by combining the simplest possible linked pair with the simplest possible single loop.")
