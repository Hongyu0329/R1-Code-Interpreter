    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, I will determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$). For this, Eisenstein's criterion is a suitable tool. If the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** Next, I will compute the discriminant of the polynomial. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. If the square root of the discriminant, $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$, is a rational number, the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group, $A_4$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** I will then construct the resolvent cubic polynomial associated with the quartic. For $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$. Determining whether this cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides crucial information that significantly narrows down the possible Galois groups.\n\n4.  **Final Identification:** The results from the previous steps will classify the Galois group into a small set of possibilities. In this case, it will be either the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4). The final distinction is made by checking if the original polynomial $f(x)$ becomes reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\n5.  **State the Order:** Once the Galois group is identified, its order is known. I will provide the final order as the answer.\n\nI will now execute this plan using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n\n\n# The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n# This fits the depressed quartic form x^4 + px + q.\np = 8\nq = 14\n\nprint(\"Step-by-step computation of the order of the Galois group for x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\nprint(\"=\"*70)\n\n# Step 1: Check for irreducibility\nprint(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q.\")\nprint(\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.
