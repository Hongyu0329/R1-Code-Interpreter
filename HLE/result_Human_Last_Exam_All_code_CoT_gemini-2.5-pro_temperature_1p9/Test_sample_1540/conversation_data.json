  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nLittle Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' case does not matter, that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.\n\nInput\nEach of the first two lines contains a bought string. The strings' lengths range from 1 to 100 inclusive. It is guaranteed that the strings are of the same length and also consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\nIf the first string is less than the second one, print \"-1\".

    "Of course. The task is to provide a memory-efficient C program for a string comparison problem and calculate the memory used by its variables. However, the instructions require me to provide the solution as a Python script.\n\nTo meet both requirements, I will provide a Python script. When you run this script, it will print out the C code you requested, along with a detailed analysis of its memory usage.\n\nMy plan for the memory-efficient C program is as follows:\n1.  Read the two input strings into character arrays. Since the maximum length is 100, the arrays need to be of size 101 to include the null terminator (`\\0`).\n2.  Iterate through both strings using a single loop. To optimize memory, the loop counter variable will be an `unsigned char`, which uses only 1 byte and is sufficient for an index up to 255.\n3.  Inside the loop, compare the characters at the current position. The comparison will be case-insensitive, achieved by converting both characters to lowercase using the `tolower()` function directly within the comparison logic.\n4.  If the characters differ, the program prints -1 or 1 and immediately exits.\n5.  If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal, and the program prints 0.\n\nThis approach minimizes variable memory usage by selecting the smallest possible data types and avoiding temporary variables. The Python code below will generate this C code and the final memory calculation for you.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef generate_c_code_and_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates and prints the most memory-efficient C program \n    for the described problem, along with its variable memory analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The memory-efficient C code, formatted as a string.\n    c_code = r\"\"\"#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n// This is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem.\nint main() {\n    // Each buffer stores up to 100 characters plus a null terminator.\n    // sizeof(char) is 1 byte.\n    // Memory usage for s1: 101 * 1 = 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Memory usage for s2: 101 * 1 = 101 bytes.\n    char s2[101];\n\n    // Read the two strings from the input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n    scanf(\"%s\", s2);\n\n    // For the loop index, an 'unsigned char' is used instead of an 'int'.\n    // An unsigned char uses 1 byte and can hold values from 0-255,\n    // which is sufficient since the string length is at most 100.\n    // Memory usage for i: 1 byte.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // Loop until the null terminator of the first string is reached.\n    while (s1[i]) {\n        // Use tolower() for case-insensitive comparison directly.\n        // This avoids creating extra temporary variables.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i])) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(s2[i])) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n    # --- Calculation details ---\n    s1_memory = 101\n    s2_memory = 101\n    index_memory = 1\n    total_memory = s1_memory + s2_memory + index_memory\n\n    # --- Print the analysis to the user ---\n    print(\"--- Requested C Program ---\")\n    print(\"Below is the most memory-efficient C code for the given task:\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(c_code)\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    print(\"--- Variable Memory Usage Analysis (m) ---\")\n    print(\"The total memory 'm' in bytes used by the program's variables is:\")\n    print(f\"* Variable `s1` (char array of size 101): {s1_memory} bytes\")\n    print(f\"* Variable `s2` (char array of size 101): {s2_memory} bytes\")\n    print(f\"* Variable `i` (loop index of type unsigned char): {index_memory} byte\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for total variable memory is:\")\n    print(f\"m = {s1_memory} + {s2_memory} + {index_memory} = {total_memory} bytes\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    generate_c_code_and_analysis()\n\n```\n<<<203>>>"
