    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction for all primes `p > 2`, we need to analyze the reduction properties of each curve.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Good Reduction**: A curve `z^2 = f(x)` has \"good reduction\" at a prime `p` if the curve remains non-singular when its coefficients are reduced modulo `p`. For `p>2`, this generally means that `p` does not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`. A curve has good reduction for all primes `p > 2` if its discriminant is of the form `±2^k` for some integer `k ≥ 0`.\n2.  **Ordinary Reduction**: This property is about the structure of the Jacobian of the curve over a finite field. For a curve that has good reduction everywhere above 2, we can then consider if its reduction is ordinary.\n3.  **Analysis Steps**:\n    *   For each curve, we will define its polynomial `f(x)`.\n    *   We will calculate the discriminant of `f(x)`.\n    *   We will find the prime factors of the discriminant to identify the primes of bad reduction.\n    *   For the singular curve (Curve E), we will find its non-singular model and analyze that instead.\n4.  **Tool**: We will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculations (discriminant and factorization).\n\nBased on this plan, we can systematically check each option.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef analyze_curve(label, f, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reduction properties of a curve z^2 = f(x).\n    It computes the discriminant of f(x) and its prime factors.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing Curve {label}: z^2 = {f} ---\")\n    \n    # Check for repeated factors by computing the discriminant\n    disc = sympy.discriminant(f, x)\n    \n    if disc == 0:\n        print(\"Discriminant is 0.
