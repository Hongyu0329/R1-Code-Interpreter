    "This is a classic poker scenario that involves understanding stack sizes, position, and tournament dynamics (specifically, ICM pressure on the money bubble). Here is a step-by-step analysis of the situation to determine the correct hand to go all-in with.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** Break down the key factors: 16bb stack, UTG1 position, and the money bubble. Explain how these factors influence our strategy.\n2.  **Evaluate Each Hand:** Assess each of the answer choices (QJs, 99, AJo, AKo) within the context of the scenario. We will determine if each hand is strong enough to shove for value and with enough equity when called.\n3.  **Compare the Viable Options:** Both 99 and AKo are strong candidates. We will compare them to determine the single best answer.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** Write a Python script that programmatically lays out this analysis and prints the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_poker_shove():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker shoving scenario near the money bubble and identifies the correct hand.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
