    "To determine the modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence, we need to trace the evolution of the original Old English word.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the current word's origin:** The modern English word \"sister\" is derived from the Old Norse `systir`.\n2.  **Find the native Old English word:** Before the Norse influence, the Anglo-Saxons used the word `sweostor` for sister.\n3.  **Trace its linguistic evolution:** We will apply known English sound change patterns to `sweostor` to project what it would have become. We can look at how other Old English words like `mōdor` (mother) and `brōþor` (brother) evolved for comparison.\n4.  **Conclude the modern form:** Following the pattern where Old English `sweostor` would become Middle English `swester` (a form which did exist but fell out of use), the most likely modern descendant would be \"swester\". This is strongly supported by its cognate in German, \"Schwester\", which evolved from the same Germanic root.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_native_english_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines what the word for \"sister\" would be\n    in Modern English without the influence of Old Norse.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The current word \"sister\" comes from Old Norse \"systir\".\n    # It replaced the native Old English term.\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    modern_word = \"sister\"\n\n    # The original Old English word was \"sweostor\".\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n\n    # In Middle English, this word became \"swester\".\n    # This followed a typical sound change (the 'eo' vowel sound simplified to 'e').\n    middle_english_word = \"swester\"\n\n    # This word, \"swester\", existed in English dialects but was eventually outcompeted\n    # by the Norse borrowing \"sister\". Without that competition, \"swester\" would have\n    # likely become the standard modern word. This is supported by its similarity\n    # to its cousin in modern German, \"Schwester\".\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"swester\"\n\n    print(\"If the Norse had never influenced the English language:\")\n    print(f\"1. The Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}' would not have been introduced.\")\n    print(f\"2. The native Old English word, '{old_english_word}', would have been preserved.\")\n    print(f\"3. Through natural linguistic evolution (similar to how 'mōdor' became 'mother'), '{old_english_word}' would have evolved.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe most likely Modern English word would therefore be:\")\n    print(f\"'{hypothetical_modern_word}'\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_native_english_word()\n    print(\"\\n<<<swester>>>\")\n```"
