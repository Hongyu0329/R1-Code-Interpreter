        "C": "The use of starch reserves primarily influences short-term, seasonal variations. It is not a mechanism that would drive a consistent, multi-decade decline.",
        "D": "This reflects changes in seasonal growth patterns. Like starch use, it is a secondary factor and is unlikely to be the predominant cause of a 100+ year trend.",
        "E": "Plausible and significant. A long-term trend towards a stronger, wetter SE Asia monsoon would increase water availability. This allows trees to keep their stomata open, increasing discrimination against 13C and causing a DECLINE in the tree ring 13C ratio. Among the choices, this large-scale climatic system is the most credible predominant factor."
