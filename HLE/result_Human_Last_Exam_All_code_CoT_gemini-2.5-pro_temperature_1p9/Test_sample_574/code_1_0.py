# Final Answer Code

# Step 1: Identify the source words from the puzzle clues.
# The clue "sleeveless garments that drape over the back and shoulders" gives us the word:
source_word_1 = "CAPES"
# The clue "experienced and trusted individuals who guide and advise others" gives us the word:
source_word_2 = "ARCHSAGES"

# Step 2: Identify the target words that form the ship's name.
# The Culture series ship name is 'Scapegrace', which can be split into two parts.
target_word_1 = "SCAPE"
target_word_2 = "GRACE"

# Step 3: Combine the target words to get the final answer.
final_ship_name = target_word_1 + target_word_2

# Step 4: Print the reasoning behind the solution.
print("The solution to the puzzle is as follows:")
print(f"1. The letters from '{source_word_1}' (from the 'sleeveless garments' clue) are used to make the word '{target_word_1}'.")
print(f"2. The letters from '{source_word_2}' (from the 'experienced individuals' clue) are used to make the word '{target_word_2}'.")
print(f"\nCombining these two words gives the Culture series ship name: '{final_ship_name}'.")

# Step 5: Print the final result in an 'equation' format, showing each letter.
# This fulfills the requirement: "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# We interpret this to mean showing each letter in the final combined word.
print("\nThe final construction of the ship's name is:")
equation = " + ".join(list(final_ship_name))
print(f"{equation} = {final_ship_name}")
