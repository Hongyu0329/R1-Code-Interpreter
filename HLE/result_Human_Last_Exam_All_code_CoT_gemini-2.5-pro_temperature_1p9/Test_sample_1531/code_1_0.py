To identify the poetic form, we analyze the meter, which is the pattern of stressed syllables.

1.  **Analyze Line 1:** '& **all** the **stars** are **pal**aces'
    - When spoken naturally, the emphasis falls on the syllables 'all', 'stars', and 'pal'.
    - This line has 3 stressed syllables.

2.  **Analyze Line 2:** 'the **world** a **hol**low **road**'
    - The emphasis here falls on 'world', 'hol' (from 'hollow'), and 'road'.
    - This line also has 3 stressed syllables.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    - A line of verse with three metrical feet (stresses) is called 'trimeter'.
    - Since both lines consistently have three stresses, the form is trimeter.
    - Therefore, option E is the correct answer.
