    print("   - Infection Control: High risk due to the 28-hour delay and uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c > 7%). Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered by the clinician.")
    print("   - Systemic Health Management: Urgent need to manage blood glucose levels. A medical consultation for the patient's diabetes is critical.")
    print("   - Dental & Skeletal Assessment: The SNB angle of 88 degrees (normal is ~80 +/- 2) suggests a Class II skeletal relationship with a protrusive mandible or a Class III relationship, which influences the long-term restorative and orthodontic plan.")

    print("\n2. Cellular Points of Interest:")
    print("   - Cells for Immune Response: Neutrophils and Macrophages. Their function can be impaired by hyperglycemia, increasing infection risk.")
    print("   - Cells for Wound Healing: Fibroblasts (for soft tissue repair) and Osteoblasts/Osteoclasts (for bone remodeling). Their activity is crucial for socket healing and can be negatively affected by poorly controlled diabetes.")

    print("\n3. General Prosthetic Restoration Factors (e.g., for a denture):")
    print("   - Type of Denture: A professional would choose between a Removable Partial Denture (RPD) or a Fixed Partial Denture (bridge) or implant-supported options. The significant delay and uncontrolled diabetes might initially favor a removable option.")
    print("   - Material Choice: For an RPD, options include a flexible base (e.g., Valplast) or a more rigid acrylic/metal framework (e.g., Chrome-Cobalt). The choice depends on factors like desired durability, aesthetics, and oral hygiene.")
    print("   - Abutment Teeth Selection: Abutments are the teeth that support the prosthesis.")
    print("     - Potential Abutments: For the lost left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar, the adjacent teeth would be the left central incisor and the left second premolar.")
    print("     - Reasons for Selection: A clinician evaluates abutment teeth based on their periodontal health, crown-to-root ratio, bone support, and absence of decay. The health of these teeth is paramount for the long-term success of any prosthesis.")
