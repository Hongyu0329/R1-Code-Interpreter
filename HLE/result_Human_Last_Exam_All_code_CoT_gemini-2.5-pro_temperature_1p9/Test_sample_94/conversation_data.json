    "This is a knowledge-based question that doesn't require a script to solve. I can provide the answer directly based on historical accounts in the field of physics and optics.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The query asks for a physicist with several specific characteristics:\n    *   Primarily known for work in microscopy.\n    *   Associated with an optical effect in \"real imagery\".\n    *   The discovery of this effect was prompted by an accidental observation made by a custodial worker.\n    *   The observation involved the cleaning of concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **Connect the Clues:** The story of an optical effect being noticed while cleaning a lens or mirror is famously associated with the development of the **Schlieren method**. This technique visualizes differences in the refractive index of fluids, making phenomena like heat waves, sound waves, or air currents visible. This certainly qualifies as an \"optical effect in real imagery\".\n\n3.  **Identify the Physicists:**\n    *   The person most directly credited with developing the Schlieren method in 1864, based on this type of accidental observation, is **August Toepler**. The story fits him almost perfectly. However, he is primarily known for his work in Schlieren photography and acoustics, not microscopy.\n    *   The clue \"better known for work in the microscopy field\" is a very strong qualifier. In 19th-century German optics, the preeminent figure in microscopy theory is **Ernst Abbe**. He worked with Carl Zeiss to revolutionize microscope design and is famous for the Abbe sine condition, the Abbe diffraction limit, and the Abbe condenser.\n\n4.  **Resolve the Conflict:** The question creates a conflict between the person associated with the story (Toepler) and the person associated with the field of expertise (Abbe). Given that the qualifier \"better known for work in the microscopy field\" is so specific, it seems intended to distinguish the correct answer from others like Toepler or LÃ©on Foucault (whose Foucault test for mirrors is similar to the Schlieren method). Therefore, Ernst Abbe is the most plausible answer, as he is the undisputed giant of theoretical microscopy from that era and geographical location.\n\n<<<Ernst Abbe>>>"
