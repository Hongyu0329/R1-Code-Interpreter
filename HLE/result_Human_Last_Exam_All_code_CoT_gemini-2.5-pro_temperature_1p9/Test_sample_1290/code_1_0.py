# The derivation results in the equation: 4*P_r = 4 - (k_0 + k_1) - 8*C_p
# where:
# P_r is the number of 'r' vertices in ]0, 1[ (a non-negative integer).
# k_0, k_1 are the orders of zeros at x=0 and x=1 (positive integers).
# C_p is the number of pairs of complex 'p' vertices (a non-negative integer).

# We need to find the maximum integer P_r satisfying this equation.
# To maximize P_r, we must maximize the right-hand side (RHS).
# RHS = 4 - (k_0 + k_1) - 8*C_p
# The minimum value of k_0 + k_1 is 1 + 1 = 2.
# The minimum value of C_p is 0.

# Let's check possible integer values for the parameters.
# Case 1: C_p = 0
# The equation becomes 4*P_r = 4 - (k_0 + k_1).
# Since P_r >= 0, we must have 4 - (k_0 + k_1) >= 0, so k_0 + k_1 <= 4.
# Also, the RHS must be a multiple of 4.
# Let's test values for k_0 + k_1 (>= 2):
# If k_0 + k_1 = 2, RHS = 4 - 2 = 2. 4*P_r = 2 -> P_r = 0.5 (not an integer).
# If k_0 + k_1 = 3, RHS = 4 - 3 = 1. 4*P_r = 1 -> P_r = 0.25 (not an integer).
# If k_0 + k_1 = 4, RHS = 4 - 4 = 0. 4*P_r = 0 -> P_r = 0 (an integer solution).

# Case 2: C_p >= 1
# The term -8*C_p will be -8, -16, ...
# RHS = 4 - (k_0 + k_1) - 8*C_p <= 4 - (2) - 8 = -6.
# A negative RHS would mean P_r is negative, which is impossible.

# The only non-negative integer solution for P_r is 0.
# The question is for the maximum number. Based on this analysis, the maximum is 0.
