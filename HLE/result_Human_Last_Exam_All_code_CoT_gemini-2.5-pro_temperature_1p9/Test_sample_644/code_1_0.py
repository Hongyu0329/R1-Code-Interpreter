# The traditional "fix" for the superstition involves the nearby Baptistery.
# A student who has climbed the tower must circle the Baptistery 100 times
# to reverse the bad luck.

# This gives us the core numbers for our required equation.
# We have one landmark (the Baptistery) and a required number of actions (100 laps).

# The number of landmarks involved in the "fix".
landmarks = 1

# The number of repetitions required.
repetitions = 100

# The resulting total for our simple equation.
total_laps = landmarks * repetitions

# Now, we will print the final equation, making sure to output each number
# as requested by the prompt.
print(f"{landmarks} * {repetitions} = {total_laps}")
