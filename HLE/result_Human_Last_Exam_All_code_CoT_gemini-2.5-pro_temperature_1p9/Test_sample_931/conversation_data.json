    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on from the given list, I will perform a logical analysis based on established entomological knowledge. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Establish a knowledge base:** I will define the known dietary habits of adult snakeflies. They are primarily predators of small, soft-bodied arthropods, but are also known to consume pollen and nectar.\n2.  **Evaluate each option:** I will check each answer choice against this knowledge base.\n3.  **Address geographic specificity:** Some options mention species native to New Zealand (Māhoe, Karamū, Totara). I will note that snakeflies are not found in New Zealand, but I will prioritize the food *type* (e.g., pollen, aphids) over the specific regional example, as this is common in biology questions to test general knowledge.\n4.  **Synthesize the findings:** Based on the evaluation, I will identify all correct individual options and find the composite answer choice that accurately combines them.\n5.  **Present the code:** The Python script will encapsulate this logic, printing the step-by-step analysis and concluding with the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # They are primarily predators and also consume nectar/pollen.\n    known_diet = {\n        'Nectar': True,\n        'Pollen': True,\n        'Aphids': True,\n        'Fungus': False,\n        'Leaf tissue': False\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the answer choices.
