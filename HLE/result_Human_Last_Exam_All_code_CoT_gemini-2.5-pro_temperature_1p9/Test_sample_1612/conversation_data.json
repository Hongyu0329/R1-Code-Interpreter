    "To determine the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we need to count the unique players who have achieved this feat for both batting and pitching. A player can win the Triple Crown multiple times, but we will only count them once for the final total.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown (leading their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs).\n2.  Second, I will identify the number of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown (leading their league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA).\n3.  Finally, I will add these two counts together to get the total number of unique players who have won a Triple Crown.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mlb_triple_crown():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n    The function first defines the number of unique players who have won the\n    batting Triple Crown and the number of unique players who have won the\n    pitching Triple Crown. It then adds these two numbers together to find\n    the total number of unique winners.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to historical MLB records, there are 16 unique players\n    # who have won the batting Triple Crown. This includes players who\n    # won it multiple times, such as Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams,\n    # who are each counted only once.\n    num_batting_winners = 16\n\n    # Similarly, there are 25 unique players who have won the pitching\n    # Triple Crown. Players like Sandy Koufax and Walter Johnson, who\n    # won it three times each, are only counted once.\n    num_pitching_winners = 25\n\n    # The total number of winners is the sum of unique batting winners\n    # and unique pitching winners.\n    total_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\n    print(\"The total number of MLB Triple Crown winners is found by adding the unique batting winners and unique pitching winners.\")\n    print(f\"Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners: {num_batting_winners}\")\n    print(f\"Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners: {num_pitching_winners}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_batting_winners} (Batters) + {num_pitching_winners} (Pitchers) = {total_winners}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThere are a total of {total_winners} unique Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\")\n\n\nsolve_mlb_triple_crown()\n```\n<<<41>>>"
