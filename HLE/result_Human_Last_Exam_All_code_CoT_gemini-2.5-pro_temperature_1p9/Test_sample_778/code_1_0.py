  Calculates the groupoid cardinality for the given problem.

  The problem asks for the groupoid cardinality of the inserter Ins(F,G) of two functors
  F, G: BZ/nZ -> BZ/mZ.

  The groupoid cardinality is given by the formula m/n, which we derive from the
  properties of the inserter groupoid.
  - The number of connected components is d = gcd(b-a, m).
  - The size of the automorphism group for any object is N_aut = nd/m.
  - The cardinality is d * (1/N_aut) = d / (nd/m) = m/n.

  This script calculates m/n and simplifies the fraction.
