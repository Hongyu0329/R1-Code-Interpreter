    Calculates the number of Goldstone bosons in kaon condensation based on QCD.

    The steps are:
    1. Define the number of quark flavors, Nf.
    2. Calculate the number of generators of the symmetry group in the gas phase.
    3. Calculate the number of generators of the unbroken symmetry group in the condensed phase.
    4. The difference gives the number of Goldstone bosons.
