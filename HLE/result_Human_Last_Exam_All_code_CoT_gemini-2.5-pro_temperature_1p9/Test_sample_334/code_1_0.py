# The challenge asks to identify the solution that meets all specified cybersecurity requirements for biometric authentication.
# The requirements are:
# 1. Prevention of spoofing and replay attacks.
# 2. Protection against authentication under coercion (unwilling user).
# 3. Security even if biometric data is stolen (data exposure).
# 4. Applicability to a wide range of biometric modalities.

# Let's analyze the options based on the prompt's descriptions.
# We are looking for the *one* solution that addresses *all* points.

# A. Multi-Factor Biometric Authentication: Fails on coercion and data exposure.
# B. Differential Privacy: Primarily for data exposure; fails on spoofing and coercion.
# C. Zero-Knowledge Biometric Proof: Excellent for data exposure but fails on coercion.
# D. Liveness Detection: Solves spoofing but fails on coercion and data exposure.
# E. AI Anomaly Detection: Addresses spoofing and coercion but is weak on data exposure.
# F. Challenge-Response Protocols: Addresses spoofing but fails on coercion and data exposure; effectiveness is also questioned.
# G. Blockchain-Based Biometrics: Addresses data integrity but fails on spoofing and coercion at the point of authentication.
# H. Adaptive Context-Aware Authentication: Strong on coercion but does not inherently protect the stored biometric data from exposure.
# I. Strong Multi-Factor Authentication: Strong against spoofing and data exposure, but a coerced user can be forced to provide all factors.
# J. Cryptographic Hashing & Salting: Solves data exposure but fails on spoofing and coercion.
# K/L. Quantum Key Distribution: Secures data in transit only; fails on spoofing, coercion, and data at rest.
# M. Revocable Fuzzy Biometric Vaults: Solves data exposure/revocability but fails on spoofing and coercion.

# N. FIPS 140-3 Level 5 Module: The description for this option explicitly claims to address all requirements.
#    - Spoofing/Replay: "safeguarding against... biometric spoofing, and advanced adversarial AI manipulation."
#    - Coercion: "safeguarding against all known and potential threats, including coercion."
#    - Data Exposure: Protected by "quantum-resistant cryptography," "hardware security enclaves," and supports "real-time revocation."
#    - Applicability: As a module handling credentials, it's modality-agnostic.

# Although "FIPS 140-3 Level 5" is a fictional security level, the *described capabilities* of this solution are the only ones that comprehensively cover all the specified requirements in the problem description.
