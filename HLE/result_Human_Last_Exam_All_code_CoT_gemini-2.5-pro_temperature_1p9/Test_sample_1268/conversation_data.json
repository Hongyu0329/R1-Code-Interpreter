    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Mathematical Problem:** The user is asking for a mathematical relationship, specifically an upper bound, involving three quantities:\n    *   A squarefree natural number `N`.\n    *   A covolume `V`.\n    *   A \"maximum norm\" denoted by `k_{k,∞}`.\n    These terms point towards the field of algebraic number theory, specifically the geometry of numbers applied to quadratic number fields of the form Q(√N).\n2.  **Define the Terms in Context:**\n    *   We will consider a real quadratic number field K = Q(√N), where N is a positive, squarefree integer.\n    *   The covolume `V` of the ring of integers of K is given by `V = √|Δ|`, where `Δ` is the discriminant of the field K.\n    *   The notation `k_{k,∞}` is non-standard. The most relevant and fundamental result in this context is the **Minkowski Bound**. This theorem provides an upper bound for the norm of an ideal in any given ideal class. I will interpret `k_{k,∞}` as this Minkowski bound.\n3.  **State the Minkowski Bound Theorem:** For any number field K of degree `n` with `s` pairs of complex embeddings, every ideal class contains an integral ideal `a` whose norm `N(a)` satisfies:\n    `N(a) ≤ (n! / n^n) * (4/π)^s * √|Δ|`\n4.  **Specialize the Formula for Real Quadratic Fields:**\n    *   For K = Q(√N), the field is real, so the degree is `n=2` and there are `s=0` pairs of complex embeddings.\n    *   Substituting these values, the bound simplifies to:\n        `N(a) ≤ (2! / 2^2) * (4/π)^0 * √|Δ| = (2 / 4) * 1 * √|Δ| = (1/2) * √|Δ|`\n5.  **Relate to the User's Terms:**\n    *   We have `V = √|Δ|`.\n    *   Substituting this into the simplified bound gives `N(a) ≤ (1/2) * V`.\n    *   Thus, the upper bound we are looking for is `(1/2) * V`. The relationship is `k_{k,∞} ≤ (1/2)V`.\n6.  **Develop Python Code:** I will write a Python script that takes a sample squarefree number `N`, calculates its corresponding discriminant `Δ` and covolume `V`, and then applies the derived formula to compute the upper bound, printing the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_minkowski_bound(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Minkowski bound for the real quadratic field Q(sqrt(N)).\n    \n    Args:\n    N (int): A positive squarefree integer.\n    \n    Returns:\n    None.
