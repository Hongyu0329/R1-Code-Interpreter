    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization Strategy**: I'll write a Python script to find all the prime factors of the number 8139881. The most straightforward method is trial division.\n2.  **Trial Division Algorithm**: I will check for divisibility by 2 first. Then, I will iterate through odd numbers (`i = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the number. For each `i` that divides the number, I will add `i` to my list of factors and divide the number by `i` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible.\n3.  **Handling the Remainder**: If, after the loop, the remaining value of the number is greater than 1, it means this remaining value is also a prime factor. This handles cases where the number is prime or has a prime factor larger than its square root.\n4.  **Identify the Largest Factor**: Once the list of all prime factors is complete, the largest prime divisor is simply the maximum value in that list.\n5.  **Construct the Output**: The script will print the prime factorization in an equation format as requested and then explicitly state the largest prime factor.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps and find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints the largest prime divisor of a given number.\n    It also prints the prime factorization equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    number = 8139881\n    n = number\n    factors = []\n    \n    # First, handle the factor 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n        \n    # Now, n must be odd. Iterate through odd numbers starting from 3.\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the current n.\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    for i in range(3, limit + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n            # Update the limit as n gets smaller\n            limit = int(math.sqrt(n))\n            \n    # If n is still greater than 2, it is the last prime factor\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(int(n))\n        \n    if not factors:\n        # This case is for numbers 0, 1.
