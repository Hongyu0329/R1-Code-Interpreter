    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Category C**: The category $C$ consists of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. I'll need to identify the specific quantum group algebra being referred to. The most common interpretation in this context is the \"small\" quantum group, often denoted $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra.\n\n2.  **Count the Objects**: I'll determine the number of indecomposable representations. For $q$ being a third root of unity ($\\ell=3$), the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is known to be of \"wild representation type\". This means there are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n\n3.  **Address the Infinite Count**: A literal calculation of percentage (finite number of irreducibles divided by an infinite number of indecomposables) would result in 0%. This is likely not the intended answer. The phrasing \"the objects of C\" likely refers to a special, finite subset of canonical indecomposable modules that are central to the study of the category. A natural choice for this set is the simple modules (the fundamental building blocks) and their projective covers (the \"largest\" indecomposable modules mapping onto the simples).\n\n4.  **Count within the Special Set**:\n    *   I will count the number of simple (irreducible) modules. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $q$ a primitive $\\ell=3$ root of unity, the simple modules are indexed by integers $c$ from $0$ to $\\ell-2$.\n    *   I will count the number of indecomposable projective modules. There is one such module for each simple module. I will also confirm that these are not simple (and thus are reducible).\n    *   The total number of objects in our special set is the sum of these two counts.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Percentage**: I will calculate the percentage of irreducible modules within this special set. The number of irreducibles in the set is simply the number of simple modules. The final equation will be of the form: (number of irreducibles) / (total special objects) * 100.\n\n6.  **Code the Solution**: I will write a Python script that performs this calculation and prints out the numbers involved in the final equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_representation_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of irreducible representations among a special set of\n    indecomposable representations for u_q(sl_2) at a 3rd root of unity.\n\n    The category C of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations for this algebra\n    has infinitely many non-isomorphic objects, as the algebra is of wild representation type.\n    However, the number of irreducible representations (simple modules) is finite.\n    A literal interpretation would yield a percentage of 0.\n\n    We adopt a standard interpretation for such questions: \"the objects of C\" refers to\n    the most fundamental indecomposable representations, which are the simple modules and\n    their indecomposable projective covers.\n\n    For q a primitive l-th root of unity, the simple modules L(c) are indexed by\n    c in {0, 1, ..., l-2}.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # In our case, q is a 3rd root of unity, so l=3.\n    l = 3\n    \n    # The simple modules are L(0), L(1), ..., L(l-2).\n    # For l=3, we have c = 0 and c = 1.\n    num_simple_modules = l - 1\n    \n    # By definition, simple modules are irreducible. They are also indecomposable.\n    num_irreducible = num_simple_modules\n    \n    # For each simple module, there is a unique indecomposable projective cover P(c).\n    # These are known to be reducible for a non-semisimple algebra like this one.\n    num_projective_modules = num_simple_modules\n    \n    # The total number of objects in our distinguished set of \"fundamental\" indecomposables\n    # is the sum of the simple modules and their projective covers.\n    total_special_objects = num_irreducible + num_projective_modules\n    \n    # Calculate the percentage of irreducibles in this set.\n    percentage = (num_irreducible / total_special_objects) * 100\n    \n    # Print the numbers that go into the final equation, as requested.\n    print(f\"Number of irreducible modules in the special set: {num_irreducible}\")\n    print(f\"Number of reducible indecomposable projective modules in the set: {num_projective_modules}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of objects in the special set: {total_special_objects}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # Using integer for percentage as it's a clean number.\n    print(f\"{num_irreducible} / {total_special_objects} * 100 = {int(percentage)}\")\n\nsolve_representation_percentage()\n```\n<<<50>>>"
