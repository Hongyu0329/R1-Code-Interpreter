def solve_representation_percentage():
    """
    Calculates the percentage of irreducible representations among a special set of
    indecomposable representations for u_q(sl_2) at a 3rd root of unity.

    The category C of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations for this algebra
    has infinitely many non-isomorphic objects, as the algebra is of wild representation type.
    However, the number of irreducible representations (simple modules) is finite.
    A literal interpretation would yield a percentage of 0.

    We adopt a standard interpretation for such questions: "the objects of C" refers to
    the most fundamental indecomposable representations, which are the simple modules and
    their indecomposable projective covers.

    For q a primitive l-th root of unity, the simple modules L(c) are indexed by
    c in {0, 1, ..., l-2}.
