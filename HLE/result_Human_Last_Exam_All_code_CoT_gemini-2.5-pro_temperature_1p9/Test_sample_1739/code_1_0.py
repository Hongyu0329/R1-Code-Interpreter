    This function calculates the terms of the nonlinear frequency correction factor for the
    Rayleigh-Plesset equation using symbolic mathematics.

    The method of multiple scales is applied to the perturbed equation. The frequency correction
    appears at the second order (O(epsilon^2)) and is proportional to the square of the
    oscillation amplitude. The coefficient of this correction is a polynomial in the polytropic
    index, gamma. This code calculates the numerator of that coefficient and extracts its terms.
