    "To solve a logic puzzle like this, it's best to break it down. We need to find the minimum number of side-stickers on the top layer that must be seen to uniquely identify any of the 21 PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) cases.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  Establish that the minimum information required is dictated by the cases that are most similar and thus hardest to tell apart. In PLL, the four \"G-Perms\" are notoriously difficult to distinguish.\n2.  Analyze the shared characteristics of the G-perms: they all have exactly one corner solved and one pair of \"headlights\" (a pair of corner stickers on a face matching that face's color).\n3.  Count the stickers needed to resolve the ambiguity between the G-perms:\n    *   First, we must identify the single solved corner. To be certain a corner is solved, we must see **both** of its side-stickers are correct.\n    *   Second, we must find where the headlights are relative to the solved corner. To do this, we must inspect the two corner stickers on an adjacent face.\n    *   Third, after narrowing it down to two G-perm possibilities, we need to check one final key sticker (usually on an edge piece) to make the final distinction.\n4.  Sum these counts to find the minimum number of stickers.\n\nThis logic is implemented in the following Python code, which will print the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    needed to be seen to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem\n    # The user wants to know the minimum number of side-stickers on the top layer\n    # one must see to know exactly which of the 21 PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) cases they have.\n    # The top-face stickers are all correctly oriented (e.g., all yellow), so we only look at the sides.\n\n    # Step 2: The principle of minimum information\n    # The minimum number of stickers is determined by the most difficult-to-distinguish cases.\n    # If we can find a group of very similar PLLs, the number of stickers needed to tell them\n    # apart sets the minimum for the entire system.\n    # In CFOP, the four \"G-Perms\" are famously similar and hard to distinguish.\n\n    # Step 3: Analyzing the G-Permutations\n    # All four G-perms share two key characteristics:\n    # 1. Exactly one corner piece is in the correct final position.\n    # 2. Exactly one pair of adjacent corners creates a \"headlight\" pattern (their side-stickers\n    #    on one face match that face's color).\n\n    # To identify a specific G-perm, a solver must determine:\n    # A) Which corner is solved.\n    # B) Where the headlights are, relative to that solved corner.\n    # C) The specific cycle of the remaining pieces.\n\n    # Step 4: Counting the stickers needed for G-Perm recognition\n    print(\"To solve this, we must find the minimum information needed to distinguish the hardest PLL cases, which are the G-permutations.\")\n    print(\"Let's count the number of stickers required to tell the four G-perms apart:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # To verify a corner is solved, you must see both of its side stickers.\n    # For example, to confirm the Front-Right corner is solved, you must see its\n    # Front-facing sticker and its Right-facing sticker are both the correct color.\n    stickers_for_solved_corner = 2\n    print(f\"1.
