The list of nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` is given by the classification presented in the python script. They are: 1. The dihedral group `D_{2q^m}` for all `q, m`. 2. The semidirect product `(C_q)^m : C_2` with inversion action for all `q, m`. 3. The special case group `C_3 x S_3` for `q=3, m=2`. 4. The special case group `H(F_3) : C_2` for `q=3, m=3`.
