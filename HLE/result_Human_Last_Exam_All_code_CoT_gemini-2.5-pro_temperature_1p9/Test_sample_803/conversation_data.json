    "This is an advanced question from group theory. The classification of nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, is known from mathematical research papers, specifically by Goryachev and Kochetkov.\n\nI will provide a Python script that summarizes this classification. The script will not perform a discovery or calculation, as this is a theoretical result. Instead, it will print a clear description of these groups, structured according to the properties of their Sylow q-subgroups.\n\nThe script will cover the following cases:\n1.  Groups where the Sylow q-subgroup is cyclic.\n2.  Groups where the Sylow q-subgroup is elementary abelian, including an exceptional case.\n3.  Groups where the Sylow q-subgroup is non-abelian, which is a single exceptional case.\n\nThis approach provides a complete answer to the user's question in the requested code format.\n\n```python\ndef describe_filled_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function describes the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q^m,\n    where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number.
