    This function solves the chemical puzzle by identifying the starting material.
    The reaction described is a Robinson annulation.
    
    1. Product: ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate.
    2. Reagents: Unknown Compound + Methyl Vinyl Ketone (MVK).
    3. Retrosynthesis: The reaction builds a new ring. We must find the structure that, when combined with MVK, yields the product.
    4. Key features from the product name:
       - 4a-carboxylate: The ester is on a bridgehead carbon. This points to a beta-ketoester starting material, where the enolate formation happens at the carbon between the ketone and ester. This carbon becomes the bridgehead.
       - 4-methyl: The methyl group is adjacent to the ester-bearing bridgehead.
    5. Conclusion: The starting material must be a cyclohexanone beta-ketoester with a methyl group positioned so it ends up at the C4 position in the product. The compound ethyl 3-methyl-2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate has the keto-ester group and a methyl group on the adjacent carbon, which is the correct precursor.
