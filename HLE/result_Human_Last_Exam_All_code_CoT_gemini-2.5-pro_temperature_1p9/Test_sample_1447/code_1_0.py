    explanation = """The shared challenge in translating Asimov's "The Next Day" and Christie's "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter" is that the central mystery hinges on a clue that is specific to the English language and its associated culture. In Asimov's story, it's a pun based on phonetics. In Christie's story, it's a culturally-specific name for a fish ("St. Peter's fish"). A literal translation would cause the clue to be lost.

The following methods are, in principle, capable of overcoming this challenge:

I. Transcreation: This is an ideal solution. A translator could invent a new, analogous linguistic puzzle using words and references from the target language to preserve the plot's cleverness.

II. Embedded audio links: A modern solution for digital formats. Providing an audio clip of the original English phrase would directly give the reader the auditory clue necessary to understand the puzzle.

III. Changing the setting: This is a form of large-scale transcreation. By moving the story to the target culture, the translator can more naturally introduce a new, local linguistic puzzle that makes sense in the new context.

VI. Footnotes: A traditional and effective method. The translator can use a footnote to explain the original untranslatable pun or cultural reference, allowing the reader to understand the logic of the plot as it was originally written.

Practices IV (making a character a foreigner) and V (adding a picture) do not solve the core linguistic problem. Therefore, the capable practices are I, II, III, and VI.
