    print(f"- Upon treatment with flagpep140-168 (the MAMP recognized by the AKP1/RIB3 pair), KIB1 moves from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm and nucleus (plasma membrane signal drops from 75% to 20%).")
    print("- This translocation is a signaling event that happens *after* the initial perception at the membrane. This places KIB1 downstream of the receptor that senses flagpep140-168.\n")

    print("Statement C is: 'RIB3 is the coreceptor of AKP1, KIB1 acts in the signaling pathway downstream of RIB3.'")
    print("- The first part, 'RIB3 is the coreceptor of AKP1', is supported by Experiment 1, as they are functionally dependent on each other to perceive flagpep140-168.")
    print("- The second part, 'KIB1 acts in the signaling pathway downstream of RIB3', is supported by Experiment 3. Since RIB3 is part of the upstream receptor complex that perceives the signal, and KIB1 translocates in response to that signal, KIB1 must be a downstream component.")
