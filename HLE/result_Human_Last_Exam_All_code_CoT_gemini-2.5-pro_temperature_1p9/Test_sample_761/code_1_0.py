    This function prints a detailed explanation of the structural differences

    print("No, polynucleotides are not, structurally, polysaccharides, even in the case of homopolynucleotides.")
    print("\nHere is a breakdown of the key structural differences:")

    print("\n1. Monomers (The Repeating Building Blocks):")
    print("   - Polysaccharides: The monomers are monosaccharides (simple sugars like glucose, fructose, or galactose).")
    print("   - Polynucleotides: The monomers are nucleotides.")

    print("\n2. Composition of Monomers:")
    print("   - Monosaccharide: A single carbohydrate unit (e.g., C6H12O6 for glucose).")
    print("   - Nucleotide: A more complex unit made of three distinct components:")
    print("     a) A pentose sugar (either deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA).")
    print("     b) A phosphate group.")
    print("     c) A nitrogenous base (e.g., Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine, Uracil).")

    print("\n3. Backbone Linkage:")
    print("   - Polysaccharides: Monomers are joined by glycosidic bonds, which form directly between carbon atoms of adjacent sugar units (a C-O-C linkage).")
    print("   - Polynucleotides: Monomers are joined by a sugar-phosphate backbone. The linkage is a phosphodiester bond, which connects the 5' carbon of one sugar to the 3' carbon of the next sugar via a phosphate group (a C-O-P-O-C linkage).")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("While both polymers contain sugar molecules, the presence of phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases in polynucleotides, and the fundamentally different phosphodiester backbone, make them a completely distinct class of macromolecules from polysaccharides.")
