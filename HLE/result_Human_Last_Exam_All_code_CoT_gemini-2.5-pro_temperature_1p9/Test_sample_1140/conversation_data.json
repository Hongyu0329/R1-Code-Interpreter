    "Of course. I can help with that. The question asks for the most helpful technique to synthesize a 100 amino acid peptide that contains an unnatural amino acid (azido phenylalanine).\n\nThis problem has two main challenges:\n1.  **Length:** 100 amino acids is very long for direct chemical synthesis.\n2.  **Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA):** The synthesis method must be able to incorporate a non-standard component.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that evaluates the common peptide synthesis techniques against these challenges. The script will perform a simple calculation to show why the most common method, Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), is not suitable on its own. It will then analyze other methods and conclude with a recommendation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_peptide_synthesis_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and recommends a synthesis technique for a long peptide\n    containing an unnatural amino acid (UAA).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Definition ---\n    peptide_length = 100\n    unnatural_aa_present = True\n    sequence_info = \"A 100aa peptide M...[KAVCLXVIGATR[...]A, where X is azido phenylalanine.\"\n\n    print(f\"--- Task: Find the best synthesis method for a specific peptide ---\")\n    print(f\"Peptide Details: {sequence_info}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Option 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Synthesis Methods ---\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
