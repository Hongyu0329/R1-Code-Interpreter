# Step 1: Identify the character in Moscow from Chapter 18.
# In this chapter, the buffet-manager Andrei Fokich Sokov, after his encounter
# with Woland, visits Professor Kuzmin's clinic. While waiting for the doctor,
# he is tormented by a bold house sparrow that flies into the waiting room.
moscow_character = "Sokov"

# Step 2: Identify the corresponding bird in the Jerusalem narrative.
# The parallel scene occurs in Chapter 2, "Pontius Pilate." While suffering
# from a terrible headache, Pilate is disturbed by a swallow.
jerusalem_bird = "barn swallow"

# Step 3: Identify the character tormented by the bird in Jerusalem.
# The swallow flies in and out of the colonnade where the Procurator is
# conducting the trial, darting under a lion's maw and distracting him.
jerusalem_character = "Pontius Pilate"

# Step 4: Assemble and print the final answer in the specified format.
final_answer = f"{moscow_character}; {jerusalem_bird}; {jerusalem_character}"
print(final_answer)
