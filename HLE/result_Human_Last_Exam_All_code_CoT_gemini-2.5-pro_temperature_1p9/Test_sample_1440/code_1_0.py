# This problem is a deductive exercise in topology.
# The step-by-step reasoning provided above leads to a single integer answer.
# The code below prints this final answer.

# Mathematical reasoning recap:
# 1. From property (2), we deduce the existence of two points, a and b,
#    which cannot belong to the same equivalence class. This proves that
#    the number of equivalence classes must be at least 2.
# 2. We use the topologist's sine curve as an example of a space X
#    that satisfies all the given properties. For this space, we can
#    show that there are exactly two equivalence classes.
#
# Conclusion: Since the number must be >= 2 and we found a case where
# it is exactly 2, the smallest possible number is 2.

smallest_possible_number_of_classes = 2

# Printing the single number in the final conclusion
print(smallest_possible_number_of_classes)
