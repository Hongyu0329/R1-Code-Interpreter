    "To determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button, we need to consult a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) preflop opening range chart for a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game. Here is my plan to arrive at the answer using a script:\n\n1.  **Define the Range of Hands**: We will focus on \"suited Jacks,\" which are hands containing a Jack and another card of the same suit. In a typical Button opening range, all suited Jacks are profitable opens. This includes JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s. For this problem, we will consider the range from JTs down to J2s as JQs and KJs are significantly stronger.\n\n2.  **Establish Ranking Criteria**: The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest Expected Value (EV). For suited hands like these, the value comes from high-card strength, flush potential, and straight potential. While all have the same flush potential, the strength decreases as the kicker (the second card) gets lower. A lower kicker reduces the hand's high-card strength and its ability to connect with flops to make straights.\n\n3.  **Identify the Weakest Hand**: By this logic, the suited Jack with the lowest kicker will be the weakest, and thus the \"worst,\" profitable open. The script will programmatically identify this hand from a defined list.\n\n4.  **Print the Result**: The script will then print the final answer in the required abbreviated format.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the worst suited jack to open from the button based on GTO principles.\n\n    In a 100BB rake-free cash game, a Button (BTN) opening range is very wide.\n    GTO solvers indicate that it is profitable to open all suited Jacks.\n    The \"worst\" of these profitable opens is the one with the lowest Expected Value (EV).\n\n    Hand value for suited connectors/gappers is derived from:\n    1. High Card Strength: A lower kicker means a weaker hand if you only pair the Jack.\n    2. Straight Potential: The lower the kicker, the less connectivity it has to make strong straights.\n    3. Flush Potential: This is constant for all suited hands.\n\n    Therefore, the suited Jack with the lowest-ranked kicker is the worst (most marginal) open.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define card ranks for sorting, from high to low.\n    # T=10, J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14\n    card_ranks = {'T': 10, '9': 9, '8': 8, '7': 7, '6': 6, '5': 5, '4': 4, '3': 3, '2': 2}\n    \n    # List of all suited Jacks typically considered in the bottom part of a BTN opening range.\n    suited_jacks = [\"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"]\n    \n    # Find the hand with the lowest ranked kicker.\n    # We initialize with a high-value hand to ensure the first comparison works.\n    worst_hand = \"JTs\"\n    lowest_rank = card_ranks['T']\n    \n    print(\"Evaluating all suited Jacks in a standard Button opening range...\")\n    \n    for hand in suited_jacks:\n        # The kicker is the second character in the string, e.g., 'T' in 'JTs'.\n        kicker = hand[1]\n        kicker_rank = card_ranks[kicker]\n        \n        print(f\"Hand: {hand}, Kicker: {kicker}, Rank: {kicker_rank}\")\n        \n        if kicker_rank < lowest_rank:\n            lowest_rank = kicker_rank\n            worst_hand = hand\n            \n    print(\"\\nBased on GTO principles, the worst (most marginal) suited Jack to open from the Button is the one with the lowest kicker.\")\n    print(\"This hand has the lowest equity and weakest straight potential among all profitable suited Jack opens.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(f\"{worst_hand}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
