    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth, we need to compare the abundance of all noble gases. The noble gases are Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon. Their primary reservoir on Earth is the atmosphere.\n\nHere is the plan to identify the rarest one and present it:\n1.  I will create a data structure (a Python dictionary) to hold the names of the noble gases and their respective abundances in Earth's atmosphere as a percentage.\n2.  I will then programmatically identify the gas with the minimum abundance from this data.\n3.  Finally, the script will print the name of this gas and its percentage abundance. The year 2002 is specified, but the atmospheric composition of these gases has not changed significantly in such a short time frame, so current standard values are appropriate. Radon (Rn) is a radioactive gas with a very short half-life, making it exceedingly rare compared to the stable noble gases.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth based on its atmospheric abundance.\n    The abundances are given as a percentage of all terrestrial matter,\n    with atmospheric concentration being the primary contributor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data represents abundance by volume percentage in Earth's atmosphere.\n    # The abundance in \"all terrestrial matter\" is overwhelmingly dominated\n    # by atmospheric concentration for these gases.\n    noble_gas_abundance_percent = {\n        'Argon (Ar)': 0.934,\n        'Neon (Ne)': 0.001818,\n        'Helium (He)': 0.000524,\n        'Krypton (Kr)': 0.000114,\n        'Xenon (Xe)': 0.0000087,\n        'Radon (Rn)': 6e-18 # 0.000000000000000006%\n    }\n\n    # Find the gas with the minimum abundance\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundance_percent, key=noble_gas_abundance_percent.get)\n    rarest_gas_percentage = noble_gas_abundance_percent[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    print(\"Comparing the abundance of noble gases as a percentage of terrestrial matter (primarily atmospheric):\")\n    for gas, percent in noble_gas_abundance_percent.items():\n        # Use scientific notation for very small numbers for better readability\n        print(f\"- {gas}: {percent:.2e}%\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe rarest noble gas is the one with the lowest percentage.\")\n    sys.stdout.write(\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon (Rn) with an approximate percentage of \")\n    # The final print needs to show each number in the equation.\n    # So we print the numbers of the percentage one by one.\n    percentage_str = f\"{rarest_gas_percentage:.1e}\" # format to 6.0e-18\n    parts = percentage_str.split('e')\n    base = parts[0]\n    exponent = parts[1]\n\n    for char in base:\n        sys.stdout.write(char)\n    sys.stdout.write(\"e\")\n    for char in exponent:\n        sys.stdout.write(char)\n    print(\" %.\")\n\n\nfind_rarest_noble_gas()\n\nprint(\"<<<Radon>>>\")\n```"
