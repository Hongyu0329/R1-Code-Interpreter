    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan and the corresponding Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Theoretical Foundation (Large Deviations):** The core idea from large deviation theory (specifically, a consequence of Sanov's Theorem in a statistical mechanics context) is that the equilibrium state of a system is the macrostate that is overwhelmingly the most probable. This corresponds to the state with the maximum number of accessible microstates, which is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy, subject to physical constraints.\n\n2.  **System and Constraints:** The system is a gas of photons (light quanta) in a volume `V` at thermal equilibrium. Photons are bosons.\n    *   **Bose Case:** We must use the entropy formula appropriate for indistinguishable bosons (Bose-Einstein statistics).\n    *   **Constraints:** For a photon gas, the total energy `U` is conserved (for a closed system at a given temperature), but the number of photons `N` is not, as photons can be absorbed and emitted by the walls of the container. This means the chemical potential is zero, which simplifies the maximization problem.\n\n3.  **Maximizing Entropy:** The task is to maximize the Bose-Einstein entropy `S` subject to a fixed mean energy `U`. This procedure, using the method of Lagrange multipliers, yields the equilibrium distribution of photons over energy levels `E`. This is the famous Planck distribution for the average occupation number of an energy state `E`:\n    `<n(E)> = 1 / (exp(E / k_B T) - 1)`\n    where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature.\n\n4.  **Calculating Mean Energy (U):** To find the total mean energy `U`, we must integrate the energy of each state multiplied by its occupation number over all possible states. This involves the density of states `g(E)` for photons in a 3D volume `V`, which tells us how many states exist per unit energy interval.\n    *   `g(E) = (V * 8 * pi * E^2) / (h * c)^3` or `g(E) = (V * E^2) / (pi^2 * hbar^3 * c^3)`\n    *   `U = integral from 0 to inf of [ E * g(E) * <n(E)> ] dE`\n    *   Solving this integral yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy:\n      `U = (pi^2 * V * (k_B * T)^4) / (15 * (hbar * c)^3)`\n\n5.  **Calculating Entropy (S):** The equilibrium entropy `S` can be found most easily using the thermodynamic relationship between `S` and `U` for a photon gas, which is `S = 4U / (3T)`. By substituting the expression for `U`, we get the entropy as a function of `V` and `T`.\n\n6.  **Python Implementation:** The code will implement these final derived formulas. It will define the necessary physical constants, take `Temperature (T)` and `Volume (V)` as inputs, and calculate `U` and `S`. To fulfill the prompt's request, the code will first print the formulas symbolically and then show the calculation with the numerical values substituted in.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Physical Constants (SI units) ---\n# Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nk_B = 1.380649e-23\n# Planck constant (J*s)\nh = 6.62607015e-34\n# Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\nhbar = h / (2 * math.pi)\n# Speed of light (m/s)\nc = 299792458\n\n# --- Input Parameters ---\n# Temperature in Kelvin (e.g., surface of the sun is ~5778 K)\nT = 5778\n# Volume in cubic meters (e.g., 1 cubic meter)\nV = 1.0\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1.
