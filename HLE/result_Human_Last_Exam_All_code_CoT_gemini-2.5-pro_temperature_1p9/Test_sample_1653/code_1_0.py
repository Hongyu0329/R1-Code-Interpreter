# Problem parameters
# We are asked to find the asymptotic behavior of h_k as k -> infinity.
# Let h_k = C * k^beta, where C is a constant.
# We need to find beta, which is given by lim_{k->inf} (ln h_k / ln k).
#
# Based on the theoretical analysis:
# 1. The problem can be interpreted using potential theory. The set A_k acts as a dipole.
# 2. The set A_k = {(0,0), (0, k^3)} has a dipole moment p proportional to the distance, p ~ k^3.
# 3. The set B_k is at a distance r ~ k^2 from A_k.
# 4. In 2D, the field of a dipole decays as E ~ p/r^2.
#    So the field strength at B_k is E ~ k^3 / (k^2)^2 = k^-1.
# 5. The probability h_k can be argued to be proportional to a power of this field. Based on related problems in statistical physics,
#    a power of 4 is a reasonable educated guess. h_k ~ E^4.
# 6. This leads to h_k ~ (k^-1)^4 = k^-4.
#
# Let's verify the limit calculation with beta = -4.
# ln(h_k) = ln(C * k^-4) = ln(C) - 4 * ln(k).
# (ln(h_k) / ln(k)) = (ln(C) / ln(k)) - 4.
# As k -> infinity, ln(C)/ln(k) -> 0.
# So the limit is -4.

beta = -4
