def solve_vertex_algebra_questions():
  """
  This function provides the answers to the three-part question about the vertex algebra V(p).
  The reasoning for each answer is as follows:
  (a) The singlet vertex algebra V(p) is known to be non-simple for all p >= 1 because it contains singular vectors that generate proper ideals.
  (b) A non-trivial ideal must, by definition, be a module over any subalgebra, including L_k(sl_2). Furthermore, any such ideal in this context is generated by a singular vector. Thus, both conditions are met.
  (c) A vertex algebra V can be simple while still being reducible as a module over a proper subalgebra U. This is because a U-submodule is not necessarily an ideal of V.
