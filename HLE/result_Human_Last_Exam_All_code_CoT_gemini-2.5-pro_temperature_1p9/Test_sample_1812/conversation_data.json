    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The user wants to compute the determinant of a given 3x3 matrix `A`. The information about the \"Markov quiver for m_1/2 = 13\" provides context for the origin of the matrix but does not change the mathematical procedure.\n2.  **Recall the Determinant Formula:** The determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n    \\[\n    B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    a & b & c \\\\\n    d & e & f \\\\\n    g & h & i\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    is calculated using the cofactor expansion formula: `det(B) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Defines the given matrix `A`.\n    *   Substitutes the elements of `A` into the determinant formula.\n    *   Prints each step of the calculation to show how the final result is obtained, fulfilling the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    *   Calculates and prints the final determinant value.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the step-by-step determinant calculation for the given 3x3 matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver is given as A.\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    # For the formula, we can represent the matrix as:\n    # A = [[a, b, c],\n    #      [d, e, f],\n    #      [g, h, i]]\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    # The determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix is:\n    # det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n    \n    print(\"The matrix A is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nTo compute the determinant, we use the formula:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\n    final_equation_str = (\n        f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h}))\"\n        f\" - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g}))\"\n        f\" + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\"\n    )\n    print(final_equation_str)\n\n    # Perform the calculations step by step\n    val_ei_fh = e * i - f * h\n    val_di_fg = d * i - f * g\n    val_dh_eg = d * h - e * g\n    \n    print(f\"\\n       = ({a})*({val_ei_fh}) - ({b})*({val_di_fg}) + ({c})*({val_dh_eg})\")\n    \n    term1 = a * val_ei_fh\n    term2 = -b * val_di_fg\n    term3 = c * val_dh_eg\n    \n    print(f\"       = {term1} + {term2} + {term3}\")\n\n    determinant = np.linalg.det(A)\n    print(f\"       = {int(determinant)}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the determinant of the given matrix is 0.\")\n\n# Execute the function to show the result\ncompute_determinant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
