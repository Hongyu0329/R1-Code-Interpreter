    "Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen,\" does not contain formal citations or a bibliography in the modern sense. Therefore, he did not formally cite anyone's lectures *within the paper itself*.\n\nHowever, it is well-documented that Einstein's work in statistical mechanics, which formed the theoretical basis for this paper, was deeply influenced by his independent study of the published works of a particular physicist. The most direct answer to the spirit of your question is the scientist whose \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" Einstein studied thoroughly.\n\nHere is a Python script to provide the name.\n\n```python\ndef find_influential_lecturer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the physicist whose published lectures were a key influence\n    on Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper.\n    \"\"\"\n    # While Einstein did not formally cite lectures in the 1905 paper, his work\n    # was heavily based on the principles of statistical mechanics which he studied\n    # from the published \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" by this scientist.\n    influential_physicist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n    print(\"Albert Einstein's work on Brownian motion was deeply influenced by the published lectures of:\")\n    print(influential_physicist)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_influential_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
