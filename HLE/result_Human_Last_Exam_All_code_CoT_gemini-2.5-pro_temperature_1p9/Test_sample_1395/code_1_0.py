# Step 1: Analyze the change in the chromatic number of the Asian country graph.

# A graph of countries on a map is planar. The Four Color Theorem states its chromatic number is at most 4.
# Before 1991, the Asian map was complex (e.g., borders around China/USSR/Afghanistan) and required 4 colors for a proper vertex coloring.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution was {chromatic_number_before}.")

# After 1991, the USSR broke apart. This added new countries and borders, but did not simplify the graph
# to make it 3-colorable. The complexity remained, so the chromatic number was still 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian country graph after the Soviet dissolution is {chromatic_number_after}.")

# Calculate the incremental change, delta_soviet, as the difference between the two chromatic numbers.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet, is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Analyze the change in the planarity of the graph.

# A graph of contiguous countries on a map is inherently planar.
# The dissolution of a country is equivalent to subdividing a region, which preserves the graph's planarity.
# Since the planarity of the graph did not change, beta is set to 1 as per the problem description.
beta = 1
print(f"The dissolution did not change the graph's planarity, so beta = {beta}.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Calculate and output the final result.

# The final answer is the product of beta and delta_soviet.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final calculation is beta * delta_soviet.")
print(f"The final equation is: {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
