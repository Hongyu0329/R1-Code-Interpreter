    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  The number of double points of the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve can be determined by analyzing the structure of its branch points over the 2-adic numbers.\n2.  First, I will identify the branch points of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$. These are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$, plus the point at infinity.\n3.  I will use the Newton polygon method to determine the 2-adic valuations of these branch points. I will use a Python script to carry out this part of the analysis.\n4.  Based on their valuations, the branch points are partitioned into \"clusters.\" Each cluster corresponds to a set of points that reduce to the same point modulo 2.\n5.  The structure of this partition determines the components of the stable reduction graph. The number of connections between components equals the number of double points.\n6.  Each component must also be stable. I will check the stability of the components that arise from the partition. A component is stable if it's a smooth curve. If a component is not stable (i.e., it has bad reduction), it degenerates further, producing more double points. I will show that the components in this case are stable.\n7.  Finally, I will count the total number of double points based on this analysis.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes the plan:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    if n % p != 0:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    # We can safely assume n is an integer for this problem\n    n = abs(int(n))\n    while n > 0 and n % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\ndef get_lower_convex_hull(points):\n    \"\"\"Computes the lower convex hull of a set of 2D points.\"\"\"\n    points.sort()\n    hull = []\n    for p in points:\n        while len(hull) >= 2:\n            p1 = hull[-2]\n            p2 = hull[-1]\n            # Check if p is to the left of the line p1-p2 (or on the line).\n            # cross_product >= 0 means p is on or above the line through p1 and p2.\n            # A negative cross_product would mean p is below, so we don't pop.\n            cross_product = (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p[0] - p1[0])\n            if cross_product < 0:\n                break\n            hull.pop()\n        hull.append(p)\n    return hull\n\ndef analyze_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stable reduction of the given curve and finds the number of double points.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The curve is y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5.\")\n    print(\"The branch points are the roots of f(x) = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 8*x and the point at infinity.\")\n    print(\"f(x) = x * (8*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^2 + x + 8).\")\n    print(\"One branch point is x=0.
