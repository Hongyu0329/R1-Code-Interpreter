    "This task requires scanning a line of Latin poetry, which involves analyzing syllable length and meter. The line provided is \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" from Catullus, which is a dactylic pentameter. This particular line is known for being metrically complex and requiring the application of several poetic licenses, which makes a straightforward analysis difficult.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that presents the most commonly accepted, albeit debated, scansion of this line. The script will not derive the scansion from first principles, as this is a notable problem verse, but will instead format the established academic solution.\n\nThe analysis is as follows:\n1.  **Meter:** Dactylic Pentameter. This meter consists of two halves, separated by a caesura (a pause).\n    *   The first half's pattern is: `Dactyl/Spondee | Dactyl/Spondee | Long Syllable`\n    *   The second half's pattern is typically: `Dactyl | Dactyl | Long Syllable`\n2.  **Line Breakdown and Licenses Applied:**\n    *   `et tibi`: The first foot is a **dactyl** (`L S S`). `et` is long by position.\n    *   `bene esse`: This scans as a **spondee** (`L L`). This requires two licenses:\n        *   Elision: The final '-e' of `bene` is elided with the initial 'e-' of `esse`, so it is pronounced `ben'esse`.\n        *   Metrical Lengthening: The first syllable, `be-`, which is naturally short, is lengthened by the poetic ictus (stress).\n    *   `soli`: This word (`sōlī`) is a spondee (`L L`). The scansion requires the main caesura to split this word. The first syllable, `so-` (`L`), serves as the long half-foot closing the first part of the line.\n    *   The second half begins with the rest of `soli`: `-li`.\n    *   `quom sibi`: `quom` is metrically shortened to a short syllable, and together with `sibi` (`S S`) it forms a **dactyl** (`L S S`).\n    *   `sit male`: The end of a pentameter is often a trochee (`L S`). `sit` is long by position, and `ma-` is short. The final `-le` is treated as a single long syllable (anceps). This forms the final two feet.\n\nThe python code below will print out each syllable with its determined length (`L` for long, `S` for short) and group them into the feet of a pentameter.\n\n```python\ndef scan_catullus_73_6():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the specific line from Catullus 73: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n    This is a notoriously difficult line.
