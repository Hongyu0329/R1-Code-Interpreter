    # Analysis of each choice
    print("Step 1: Analyzing Statement A")
    print("A. Some later discussions of Augustine's concept of 'free will' argued that his approach was, in fact, Calvinist in nature, because there is a suggestion that destiny was predetermined from the point of creation.")
    print("Verdict: CORRECT. This is a common and long-standing debate in theology and history of philosophy. Augustine's strong doctrines on predestination and efficacious grace are seen by many as foundational for later thinkers like John Calvin. This statement accurately reflects a real scholarly discussion.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyzing Statement B")
    print("B. Medieval historian R. A. Markus argued that Augustine's view of freedom was asymmetrical, while ignoring his thoughts on predestination and grace.")
    print("Verdict: INCORRECT. This statement misrepresents the work of R. A. Markus. Markus is a renowned Augustine scholar whose work ('Saeculum,' for example) is celebrated for its nuanced integration of Augustine's concepts. He specifically does NOT ignore predestination and grace; rather, he argues that Augustine's entire social and political thought is unintelligible without them. He connects freedom directly to grace, arguing that true freedom for Augustine is the freedom from the compulsion to sin, which is only possible through grace. Therefore, the claim that he 'ignored' these concepts is false.\n")

    print("Step 3: Analyzing Statement C")
    print("C. Augustine, in his discussion of the concept of 'bonae voluntatis,' echoing Seneca, determined that the 'voluntas' was a part of the human psyche.")
    print("Verdict: CORRECT. 'Bonae voluntatis' means 'of a good will'. Augustine's concept of the 'voluntas' (will) is a central part of his anthropology and psychology. He was deeply engaged with classical philosophy and his ideas show the influence of Stoic thinkers like Seneca, even as he adapted them for his own Christian theological purposes.\n")

    print("Step 4: Analyzing Statement D")
    print("D. For Augustine it can be argued that it is impossible to mark the separation between philosophy and theology, due to the fact that philosophical question, such as the existence of a 'free will,' operate differently when discussing a theological concept such as 'grace.'")
    print("Verdict: CORRECT. This is a hallmark of Augustinian thought. Unlike later scholastics such as Aquinas who drew clearer lines, Augustine's work is characterized by the deep interpenetration of faith and reason, theology and philosophy. Philosophical problems are always viewed through a theological lens.\n")
    
    print("Step 5: Analyzing Statement E")
    print("E. Etiene Gilson, in discussing 'grace' in relationship to 'free will' argued that Augustine's idea was rooted in a sense of the 'irresistibility' of God's grace, but not in the Jansenist form.")
    print("Verdict: CORRECT. This reflects a key nuance in Augustinian scholarship. Scholars like the prominent medievalist Etienne Gilson are careful to distinguish Augustine's doctrine of irresistible grace from the more rigid and fatalistic interpretation of the Jansenists, which was condemned by the Church. Gilson and others would uphold this distinction.\n")

    print("Step 6: Analyzing Statement F")
    print("F. Augustine argued against Evodius on the cause of 'free will' in several ways, including that though man is born with a 'voluntas,' in the end he himself 'wills' and thus is responsible for his own acts.")
    print("Verdict: CORRECT. This is an accurate summary of a key argument from Augustine's dialogue 'On Free Choice of the Will' ('De libero arbitrio'). In his discussions with Evodius, Augustine affirms that God gave humans free will, and that humans, not God, are responsible for using that will to choose sin.\n")

    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion: After analyzing all the options, statement B is the only one that contains a factual error regarding the scholarship on Saint Augustine.\n")
    print("<<<B>>>")
