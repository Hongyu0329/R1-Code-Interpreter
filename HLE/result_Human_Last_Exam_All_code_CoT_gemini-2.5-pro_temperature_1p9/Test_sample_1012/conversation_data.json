    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length to be secure against a quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum attack against symmetric-key cryptography.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The primary quantum threat to symmetric-key algorithms (like AES) is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Explain the Impact:** Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, such as brute-forcing a cryptographic key. For a key of *n* bits, a classical computer requires roughly 2^n operations. A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm requires only about sqrt(2^n), or 2^(n/2), operations. This effectively halves the security level in bits.\n3.  **Define the Security Goal:** The current industry standard for strong, long-term security against classical computers is a 128-bit security level. This means an attacker would need to perform approximately 2^128 operations to break it, which is considered computationally infeasible.\n4.  **Calculate the Required Key Length:** To maintain this 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the quantum attack effort must be at least 2^128. Let *n* be the required symmetric key length. We need to solve the following equation:\n    *Quantum Effort* >= *Target Security Level*\n    2^(n/2) >= 2^128\n    n/2 >= 128\n    n >= 256\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, a symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long to provide a security level equivalent to 128 bits against an attacker with a powerful quantum computer.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The accepted classical security level for long-term data protection is 128 bits.\n# This means an attacker needs to perform 2^128 operations to break it.\nclassical_security_level_bits = 128\n\n# Grover's algorithm, a quantum search algorithm, provides a quadratic speedup.\n# This means the exponent of the work factor is effectively halved.\n# To counteract this, the key length must be doubled to maintain the same security level.\nquantum_resistance_factor = 2\n\n# Calculate the minimum required key length for post-quantum security.\nrequired_post_quantum_key_length_bits = classical_security_level_bits * quantum_resistance_factor\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Define the target classical security level.\")\nprint(f\"Target Security Level: {classical_security_level_bits} bits (requires 2^{classical_security_level_bits} operations to break).\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Account for the quantum threat (Grover's Algorithm).\")\nprint(\"Grover's algorithm effectively halves the bit-security of a key.\")\nprint(\"To maintain the target security, we must double the key length.\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the required post-quantum key length.\")\nprint(f\"Equation: Required Length = Target Security Level * Quantum Factor\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {classical_security_level_bits} * {quantum_resistance_factor} = {required_post_quantum_key_length_bits} bits\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: A symmetric key needs to be at least {required_post_quantum_key_length_bits} bits long to be secure against a quantum computer.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
