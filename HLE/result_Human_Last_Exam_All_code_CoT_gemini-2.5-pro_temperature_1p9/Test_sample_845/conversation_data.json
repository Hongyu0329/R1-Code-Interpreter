    "Of course. Here is the explanation and the Python code to answer your question.\n\nThe value you're asking about is the fundamental unit of measurement for calculating Heart Rate Variability (HRV). While Heart Rate (HR) is an average measure (like beats per minute), HRV looks at the precise changes in timing from one heartbeat to the next.\n\nThis time measured between two consecutive heartbeats is called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**. When measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG), it is often referred to as the R-R interval, named after the 'R' peaks in the ECG waveform. With Photoplethysmography (PPG), the general term IBI is most appropriate.\n\nThe following Python script will print this term for you.\n\n```python\n# The value captured between heartbeats to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\n# is the time interval between two successive beats.\n\n# Define the term\nvalue_name = \"Inter-beat Interval (IBI)\"\n\n# Print the answer\nprint(f\"The value between heartbeats used to compute HRV is called the: {value_name}\")\n\n```\n<<<Inter-beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
