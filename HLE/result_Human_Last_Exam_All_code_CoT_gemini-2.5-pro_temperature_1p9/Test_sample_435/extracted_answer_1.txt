Based on its role in promoting T cell survival, persistence, and the development of potent memory phenotypes, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit increased and more sustained cytokine release (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it.
