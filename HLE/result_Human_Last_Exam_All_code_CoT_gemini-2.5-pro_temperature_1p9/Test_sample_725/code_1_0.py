# The fundamental principle is that covalency is directly proportional to orbital overlap.
# A greater overlap leads to a stronger covalent character in the bond.

# Step 1: Assign placeholder values for orbital overlap based on the problem statement.
# The problem states CeF6(2-) has greater 4f-ligand orbital overlap than CeCl6(2-).
# We can represent this relationship with numbers. The exact values are illustrative.
relative_overlap_CeF6 = 15
relative_overlap_CeCl6 = 8

# Print out the initial data from the problem.
print("Relative orbital overlap for CeF6(2-):")
print(relative_overlap_CeF6)

print("Relative orbital overlap for CeCl6(2-):")
print(relative_overlap_CeCl6)

# Step 2: Compare the values to determine which compound has stronger covalency.
# We will construct a sentence that includes our numbers to explain the result.
if relative_overlap_CeF6 > relative_overlap_CeCl6:
    comparison_result = "stronger"
else:
    comparison_result = "weaker"

# Step 3: Print the final conclusion.
print(f"\nSince {relative_overlap_CeF6} is greater than {relative_overlap_CeCl6}, the orbital overlap is greater in CeF6(2-).")
print(f"Therefore, CeF6(2-) displays {comparison_result} covalency compared to CeCl6(2-).")
