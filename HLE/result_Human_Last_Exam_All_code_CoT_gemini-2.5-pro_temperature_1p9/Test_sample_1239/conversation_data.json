    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nThe problem asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This is a well-known result from the field of mathematical physics. The dimension of a Lie group corresponds to the number of independent parameters needed to specify a transformation within that group. I will solve this by breaking down the full symmetry group into its constituent parts and summing their individual dimensions.\n\n1.  **Identify the Symmetries:** I will list the fundamental continuous transformations that leave the equations invariant. These include:\n    *   Time translations\n    *   Space translations\n    *   Space rotations\n    *   Galilean boosts (changes of inertial frame)\n    *   Scaling transformations (dilations)\n    *   Pressure shifts (gauge freedom)\n\n2.  **Determine the Dimension of Each Symmetry:** I will count the number of independent parameters for each transformation in 3-dimensional space.\n    *   Time is 1-dimensional, so time translation has 1 parameter.\n    *   Space is 3-dimensional, so translations and rotations have 3 parameters each.\n    *   Galilean boosts correspond to a velocity vector, which has 3 components.\n    *   Scaling and pressure shifts are each governed by a single parameter.\n\n3.  **Sum the Dimensions:** The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetries.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that defines a variable for each of these dimensions, prints out the breakdown, and then calculates and prints the total sum, showing the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The dimension of the symmetry group is the sum of the dimensions of\n    # its independent one-parameter subgroups.
