    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Understand the System**: The problem describes an elementary cellular automaton. This is a system where a sequence of 0s and 1s (a generation) evolves into a new sequence. The value of each new cell is determined by a fixed \"rule\" based on the value of the cell and its immediate left and right neighbors in the previous generation. The grid is circular (periodic boundary conditions), meaning the neighbor of the first cell is the last cell, and vice-versa.\n2.  **Identify the Unknowns**: We are given the first generation (`01101001`) and the third generation (`10000111`). The intermediate second generation and the rule used for the evolution are unknown.\n3.  **Formulate a Strategy**: The core idea is that the *same rule* must be used to get from generation 1 to 2, and from generation 2 to 3. There are only 256 possible rules for elementary cellular automata (Rule 0 to Rule 255). I can write a program to test every single rule.\n4.  **Execute the Plan**: For each of the 256 rules, I will perform the following steps:\n    a. Apply the current rule to the first generation (`01101001`) to calculate a candidate for the second generation.\n    b. Apply the same rule to this candidate second generation to calculate a candidate for the third generation.\n    c. Compare the calculated third generation with the one given in the problem (`10000111`).\n    d. If they match, I have found the correct rule, and the candidate for the second generation is the solution. Since the problem asks for the *only* valid solution, I can stop as soon as the first match is found.\n\nI will now provide the Python code that implements this brute-force search.\n\n```python\ndef solve_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 2-step elementary cellular automaton evolution\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    gen1_str = \"01101001\"\n    gen3_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    # Convert strings to lists of integers for computation\n    gen1 = [int(c) for c in gen1_str]\n    gen3 = [int(c) for c in gen3_str]\n    n = len(gen1)\n\n    def apply_rule(state, rule_num):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given rule to a state, assuming periodic boundaries.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Get the 8-bit binary representation of the rule.
