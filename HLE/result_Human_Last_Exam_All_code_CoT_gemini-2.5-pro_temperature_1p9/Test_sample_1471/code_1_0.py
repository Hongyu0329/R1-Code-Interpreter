# 1. Define the decoded numerical values from the Cuneiform script.
# ' spinner ' = 40
# ' u u u ' = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30
# ' u u n n n ' = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23
num1 = 40
num2 = 30
num3 = 23

# 2. Perform the mathematical calculation.
result = num1 / num2 - num3

# 3. Print the translated equation and its solution.
print("The equation is translated from Cuneiform numerals to modern numbers as follows:")
