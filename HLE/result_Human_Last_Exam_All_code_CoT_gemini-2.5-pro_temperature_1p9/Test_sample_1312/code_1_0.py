    print("The question asks for a genomic feature that compensates for 'limited recombination'.")
    print("Limited recombination can lead to 'Muller's Ratchet', where harmful mutations accumulate over time because they cannot be removed through genetic shuffling.")
    print("We need a feature that provides a buffer against this accumulation of mutations.\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluating the Answer Choices")
    print(f"  - A ({options['A']}): Unlikely. These are not a primary mechanism for genome-wide stability.")
    print(f"  - B ({options['B']}): Incorrect. These suppress recombination, making the problem worse in those regions.")
    print(f"  - C ({options['C']}): Unlikely. Their movement is often random and mutagenic, not a structured defense.")
    print(f"  - D ({options['D']}): Strong candidate. Arising from gene duplication, they provide gene redundancy. If one gene copy is mutated, others can maintain function. This directly counters Muller's Ratchet.")
    print(f"  - E ({options['E']}): Strong candidate. This is a large-scale duplication creating massive gene redundancy, serving a similar purpose to multigene families.\n")
    
    print("Step 3: Conclusion")
    print("Both (D) and (E) describe mechanisms providing gene redundancy. However, 'Multigene families' (D) is a more general term for the resulting genomic architecture that provides this protection.")
