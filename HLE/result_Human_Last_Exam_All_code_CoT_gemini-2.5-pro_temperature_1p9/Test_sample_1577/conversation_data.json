    "To determine the ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we can count the number of independent logical operators. We assume the code is on a topologically spherical surface.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Logical Operators:** For the toric code, logical operators are string-like operators that are closed loops (or connect boundaries) and commute with all Hamiltonian terms (stabilizers) but are not products of them. For a surface with boundaries, we must consider loops around the boundaries.\n2.  **Smooth vs. Rough Boundaries:**\n    *   A **smooth** boundary allows `Z`-type logical loop operators to exist around it.\n    *   A **rough** boundary allows `X`-type logical loop operators to exist around it.\n3.  **Count Independent Operators:**\n    *   We have `n` smooth holes, which gives `n` potential `Z`-type loop operators. However, due to the topology of the sphere, there is one constraint relating them (the product of all these loop operators is trivial). This leaves `n-1` independent `Z`-type operators.\n    *   Similarly, the `m` rough holes give `m` potential `X`-type loop operators, with one constraint, leaving `m-1` independent `X`-type operators.\n4.  **Calculate Degeneracy:** The `Z`-type and `X`-type loop operators constructed this way all commute with each other. The total number of independent, commuting logical operators is the sum of the independent `Z`-type and `X`-type operators: `(n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2`. The ground state degeneracy is 2 raised to the power of this number.\n5.  **Final Formula:** The GSD is `2^(n+m-2)`. Note that this reasoning is most direct for cases where `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`.\n\nLet's write a simple Python script to calculate this value for an example case.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_degeneracy(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground state degeneracy of the toric code\n    with n smooth and m rough holes based on the formula 2^(n+m-2).\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n        print(\"Note: The formula 2^(n+m-2) is typically derived for cases where n > 0 and m > 0.\")\n        # Other formulas apply for cases with only one boundary type.\n        # For n>0, m=0: GSD = 2^(n-1)\n        # For m>0, n=0: GSD = 2^(m-1)\n        # The provided multiple-choice options seem to rely on the simplified n,m > 0 case.\n        if n > 0 and m == 0:\n            exponent = n-1\n            print(f\"For n={n}, m={m}, a more specific formula gives 2^({n}-1) = {2**exponent}.\")\n            return\n        elif m > 0 and n == 0:\n            exponent = m-1\n            print(f\"For n={n}, m={m}, a more specific formula gives 2^({m}-1) = {2**exponent}.\")\n            return\n        else: # n=0, m=0 (sphere)\n            print(\"For n=0, m=0 (a sphere), the degeneracy is 1.\")\n            return\n\n    # Calculate based on the formula matching the multiple-choice option\n    exponent = n + m - 2\n    result = 2**exponent\n\n    print(\"The ground space degeneracy is given by the formula: 2^(n + m - 2)\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n} and m = {m}:\")\n    # Output the final equation with the numbers substituted.\n    print(f\"2^({n} + {m} - 2) = 2^{exponent} = {result}\")\n\n# Example usage with some values for n and m.\nn_smooth = 4\nm_rough = 3\ncalculate_degeneracy(n_smooth, m_rough)\n```\n<<<B>>>"
