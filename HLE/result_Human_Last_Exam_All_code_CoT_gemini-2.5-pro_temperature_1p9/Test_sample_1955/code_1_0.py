    # The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of max({Œª,Œº}) \ min({Œª,Œº}).
    # Let's break down the analysis.
    # 1. Œº is the dominating number on functions over Œ∫‚Å∫, denoted ùî°_{Œ∫‚Å∫}.
    # 2. Œª is a covering number, often denoted ‚Ñå(Œ∫‚Å∫).
    # 3. It's a theorem in ZFC (the standard axioms of set theory) that Œª ‚â§ Œº.
    # 4. Therefore, max({Œª,Œº}) = Œº and min({Œª,Œº}) = Œª.
    # 5. The expression becomes the set difference Œº \ Œª.
    # 6. If Œª < Œº, the cardinality of the set of ordinals {Œ± | Œª ‚â§ Œ± < Œº} is Œº.
    # 7. If Œª = Œº, the cardinality is 0.
    # 8. To find the maximum possible cardinality, we need to find the maximum possible value of Œº
    #    in a model of set theory where Œª < Œº.
    # 9. The value of Œº = ùî°_{Œ∫‚Å∫} is always less than or equal to 2^(Œ∫‚Å∫).
    # 10. It is consistent with ZFC that Œª can be small (e.g., Œ∫‚Å∫) while Œº is simultaneously large.
    #     Specifically, there are models where Œª = Œ∫‚Å∫ and Œº = 2^(Œ∫‚Å∫). In these models, we assume 2^(Œ∫‚Å∫) > Œ∫‚Å∫.
    # 11. In such a model, the cardinality of the set difference Œº \ Œª is Œº, which is 2^(Œ∫‚Å∫).
    # 12. Since Œº cannot be larger, this is the maximum possible value.
    
    # The final answer is a symbolic expression.
    final_answer_expression = "2^(Œ∫‚Å∫)"
    
    print("The maximum possible cardinality of max({Œª,Œº}) \ min({Œª,Œº}) is a symbolic expression dependent on the cardinal Œ∫.")
    print("The final equation for the maximum cardinality is: max_card = 2**(kappa_plus)")
    
    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # The number in "2**(kappa_plus)" is 2.
    print("The number appearing in the final equation is:")
