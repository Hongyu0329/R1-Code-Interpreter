    "My plan is to analyze the key elements of the question to identify the specific Christian theologian. The crucial points are that this theologian must be the *first* to develop *specialized terminology* to explain alterations in the natural order, and this framework must be applicable to both miracles like the virgin birth and the theological concept of the Fall's effect on nature. Based on theological history, the answer points to a foundational figure in early Western Christianity who developed concepts that were influential for centuries. I will provide the answer and a brief explanation within a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_theological_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the answer to the user's question\n    about a specific Christian theologian.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology, \"\n        \"notably the concept of 'rationes seminales' (seminal reasons or causal principles), \"\n        \"is Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD).\\n\\n\"\n        \"He proposed that God embedded these latent causal principles within creation \"\n        \"from the very beginning. The normal course of nature is the unfolding of these \"\n        \"principles over time. A miracle, such as the virgin birth, is not a violation of \"\n        \"the natural order but rather God's direct activation of a potential He had already \"\n        \"placed within creation. This same framework can be used to understand how the natural \"\n        \"laws could be altered at the Fall, changing the conditions under which these 'seminal \"\n        \"reasons' would manifest.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_theological_query()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
