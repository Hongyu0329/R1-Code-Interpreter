    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of integers $x$ for which the expression $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square. Let's say $P(x) = y^2$ for some integer $y$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the expression**: The expression is a cubic polynomial. For an integer $x$, $P(x)$ must be a non-negative integer to be a perfect square. We can determine the ranges of $x$ for which $P(x) \\ge 0$.\n2.  **Search for solutions**: We'll write a Python script to search for integer values of $x$ that satisfy the condition. The search will cover the ranges identified in the analysis.\n3.  **Determine the search range**:\n    *   For large positive $x$, $P(x) \\approx x^3 > 0$.\n    *   For large negative $x$, $P(x) \\approx x^3 < 0$. So there is a lower bound for $x$ beyond which $P(x)$ is always negative.\n    *   By testing values, we find that $P(-9) = -321 < 0$ and $P(-8) = 96 > 0$. So for $x \\le -9$, $P(x)$ will be negative.\n    *   Also, we find $P(7) = 111 > 0$ and $P(8) = -32 < 0$. And $P(16) = -96 < 0$ and $P(17) = 121 > 0$. So $P(x)$ is negative for $x$ between $8$ and $16$.\n    *   This means we only need to check integers $x$ in the ranges $[-8, 7]$ and $[17, \\infty)$.\n4.  **Implement the search**: The script will iterate through a wide range of integers (e.g., from -8 up to a large number like 50000, which is more than sufficient for typical problems of this nature). For each $x$, it calculates $P(x)$, and if $P(x) \\ge 0$, it checks if the square root of $P(x)$ is an integer.\n5.  **Output the result**: The script will print the values of $x$ found and the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the search:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_perfect_square_solutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of integers x for which x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square.\n    \"\"\"\n    solutions = []\n    # Based on analysis, we only need to check x >= -8.\n    # We search up to a large number to be confident.\n    for x in range(-8, 50000):\n        # We know P(x) is negative for x in [8, 16]\n        if 8 <= x <= 16:\n            continue\n            \n        val = x**3 - 16*x**2 - 72*x + 1056\n        \n        if val >= 0:\n            sqrt_val = math.isqrt(val)\n            if sqrt_val * sqrt_val == val:\n                solutions.append(x)\n                y = sqrt_val\n                print(f\"Found solution: x = {x}, P(x) = {x}^3 - 16*({x}^2) - 72*({x}) + 1056 = {val} = {y}^2\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of integer solutions for x is {len(solutions)}.\")\n    print(\"The values of x are:\", solutions)\n\nfind_perfect_square_solutions()\n\n```\n<<<3>>>"
