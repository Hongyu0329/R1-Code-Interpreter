    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the atoms in the molecule. The name `6-311G**` itself provides the recipe for how many primitives are used for each atomic orbital.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name:** I will explain what each part of `6-311G**` means in terms of primitive Gaussians.\n    *   `6-`: This describes the core atomic orbitals. They are represented by one contracted function composed of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   `-311`: This describes the valence atomic orbitals. They are split into three functions (a triple-zeta representation). The three functions are composed of **3**, **1**, and **1** primitive Gaussians, respectively.\n    *   `G`: This just stands for Gaussian.\n    *   `**`: These are polarization functions. The first `*` adds one set of d-type functions to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. A standard set has **6** primitive d-functions. The second `*` adds one set of p-type functions to hydrogen atoms, which consists of **3** primitive p-functions.\n2.  **Calculate for an Example:** Since the total number depends on the molecule, I will perform the calculation for a common example, **methane (CH4)**, which contains both a heavy atom (Carbon) and hydrogen atoms.\n3.  **Provide the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the detailed steps and the final answer, showing the equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_primitives_6_311g_star_star():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Gaussian functions for a molecule\n    with the 6-311G** basis set.\n\n    This function uses methane (CH4) as a representative molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define the components of the 6-311G** basis set ---\n\n    # For any atom's valence s and p orbitals\n    valence_split = [3, 1, 1]\n    valence_sum = sum(valence_split)\n\n    # --- Carbon (heavy atom) ---\n    num_c_atoms = 1\n    # Core (1s orbital)\n    c_core_primitives = 6\n    # Valence s-orbital (2s)\n    c_valence_s_primitives = valence_sum\n    # Valence p-orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz)\n    c_valence_p_primitives = 3 * valence_sum\n    # Polarization d-functions (from the first '*')\n    # A standard set of d-functions has 6 components (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz)\n    c_polarization_primitives = 6\n\n    # Total for one Carbon atom\n    c_total = c_core_primitives + c_valence_s_primitives + c_valence_p_primitives + c_polarization_primitives\n\n    # --- Hydrogen ---\n    num_h_atoms = 4\n    # Hydrogen has no core electrons; its 1s orbital is treated as valence.\n    # Valence s-orbital (1s)\n    h_valence_s_primitives = valence_sum\n    # Polarization p-functions (from the second '*')\n    # A set of p-functions has 3 components (px, py, pz)\n    h_polarization_primitives = 3\n\n    # Total for one Hydrogen atom\n    h_total = h_valence_s_primitives + h_polarization_primitives\n\n    # --- Methane (CH4) Molecule ---\n    total_primitives = (num_c_atoms * c_total) + (num_h_atoms * h_total)\n\n    # --- Print the explanation and results ---\n    print(\"Calculating the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set for a methane (CH4) molecule.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- For one Carbon atom (a heavy atom) ---\")\n    print(f\"- Core (1s orbital): represented by {c_core_primitives} primitives.\")\n    print(f\"- Valence s (2s orbital): represented by {valence_split[0]} + {valence_split[1]} + {valence_split[2]} = {c_valence_s_primitives} primitives.\")\n    print(f\"- Valence p (2p orbitals): 3 orbitals * ({valence_split[0]} + {valence_split[1]} + {valence_split[2]}) = {c_valence_p_primitives} primitives.\")\n    print(f\"- Polarization (d-functions): represented by {c_polarization_primitives} primitives.\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {c_core_primitives} + {c_valence_s_primitives} + {c_valence_p_primitives} + {c_polarization_primitives} = {c_total}\")\n    print(f\"Total for one Carbon atom = {c_total} primitives.\")\n\n\n    print(\"\\n--- For one Hydrogen atom ---\")\n    print(f\"- Valence (1s orbital): represented by {valence_split[0]} + {valence_split[1]} + {valence_split[2]} = {h_valence_s_primitives} primitives.\")\n    print(f\"- Polarization (p-functions): represented by {h_polarization_primitives} primitives.\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {h_valence_s_primitives} + {h_polarization_primitives} = {h_total}\")\n    print(f\"Total for one Hydrogen atom = {h_total} primitives.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- For one Methane (CH4) molecule ---\")\n    print(f\"Total primitives = ({num_c_atoms} * primitives for Carbon) + ({num_h_atoms} * primitives for Hydrogen)\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {num_c_atoms} * ({c_total}) + {num_h_atoms} * ({h_total}) = {total_primitives}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians for CH4 with the 6-311G** basis set is {total_primitives}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_primitives_6_311g_star_star()\n```\n<<<64>>>"
