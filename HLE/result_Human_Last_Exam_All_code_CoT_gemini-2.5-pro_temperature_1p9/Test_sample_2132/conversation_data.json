    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone involves a ring contraction from a six-membered ring to a five-membered ring. In the presence of a common base like sodium methoxide (NaOMe), the product formed is methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\n2.  **Determine the Chemical Formula and Atom Count:** The chemical formula for methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is C₇H₁₂O₂. The total number of atoms (N) is 7 (Carbon) + 12 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = 21.\n\n3.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** We must determine the symmetry classes of the atoms in the molecule to apply the Böttcher formula. The product, methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, is a chiral molecule with no symmetry elements. This means nearly every atom is in its own unique class. The only exception is the three hydrogen atoms on the freely rotating methyl (-CH₃) group, which are considered equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, we have one class of 3 equivalent atoms (N₁ = 3).\n    *   The remaining (21 - 3) = 18 atoms are all unique, each forming a class of size 1.\n\n4.  **Apply the Böttcher Molecular Complexity Formula:** The formula is:\n    C = N * log₂(N) - Σ(Nᵢ * log₂(Nᵢ))\n    where N is the total number of atoms and Nᵢ is the number of atoms in the i-th symmetry class.\n    *   For our product, N = 21.\n    *   The summation term Σ(Nᵢ * log₂(Nᵢ)) will be calculated over one class of 3 atoms and eighteen classes of 1 atom. Note that log₂(1) = 0, so the eighteen classes of size 1 do not contribute to the summation.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters based on the molecular structure\n# Product: methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate (C7H12O2)\nN = 21  # Total number of atoms (7 C + 12 H + 2 O)\n\n# Step 2: Define the symmetry classes (Ni)\n# The molecule is chiral. The only equivalent atoms are the 3 H's of the methyl group.\n# So, we have 1 class of 3 atoms, and (21-3)=18 classes of 1 atom.\n# The number of atoms in each class are N_i = [3, 1, 1, 1, ..., 1] (18 times 1)\nn_i_values = [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the summation term: Σ(Ni * log2(Ni))\n# Note that log2(1) = 0, so classes of size 1 don't contribute to the sum.\nsum_term = 0\nfor n_i in n_i_values:\n    if n_i > 1:\n        sum_term += n_i * math.log2(n_i)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the full Böttcher Molecular Complexity\n# Formula: C = N*log2(N) - Σ(Ni * log2(Ni))\ncomplexity = N * math.log2(N) - sum_term\n\n# Step 5: Print the results, explaining the calculation\nprint(\"Calculation of Böttcher Molecular Complexity for methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\nprint(\"The formula is: C = N * log2(N) - Σ(Ni * log2(Ni))\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms (N): {N}\")\nprint(\"Symmetry classes found:\")\nprint(\" - 1 class of 3 atoms (the methyl hydrogens)\")\nprint(\" - 18 classes of 1 atom (all other unique atoms)\")\nprint(\"\\nBreaking down the calculation:\")\n\n# The final equation as requested by the user prompt\nn1 = 3\nn2 = 1\ncount_n2 = 18\nprint(f\"The equation with values is: C = {N} * log2({N}) - ({n1}*log2({n1}) + {count_n2} * ({n2}*log2({n2})))\")\n\nterm1 = N * math.log2(N)\nprint(f\"Term 1: N * log2(N) = {N} * {math.log2(N):.4f} = {term1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Term 2 (Summation): Σ(Ni * log2(Ni)) = {n1}*log2({n1}) = {sum_term:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The term '{count_n2} * ({n2}*log2({n2}))' is 0, since log2(1)=0.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\nprint(f\"Complexity = {term1:.4f} - {sum_term:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Böttcher Molecular Complexity = {complexity:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<87.4837>>>"
