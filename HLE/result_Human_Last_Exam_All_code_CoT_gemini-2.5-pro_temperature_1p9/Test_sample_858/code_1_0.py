    Step 1: Understand the definitions.
    - X is a continuum (compact, connected, Hausdorff space).
    - Aposyndetic: For any two distinct points x, y in X, there's a subcontinuum K such that x is in the interior of K, and K does not contain y. This is a strong separation property.
    - Non-block point: A point p is a non-block point if the space without it, X \\ {p}, contains a dense subset that is continuum-connected.

    Step 2: Establish the core relationship.
    A fundamental theorem in point-set topology, resulting from the work of F. Burton Jones, states that if a continuum X is aposyndetic, then for any point p in X, the resulting space X \\ {p} is connected and locally connected. Being connected and locally connected implies it is continuum-connected. Therefore, in an aposyndetic continuum, X \\ {p} is itself a dense (trivially) continuum-connected subset of itself.
    This means: In an aposyndetic continuum, *every point* is a non-block point.

    Step 3: Re-frame the question.
    Given the conclusion from Step 2, the set of non-block points is the entire space X itself. The problem is now simplified to finding the smallest possible cardinality of an aposyndetic continuum.
    Let N be the set of non-block points. The question is to find min(|N|).
    From our reasoning, N = X. So, we need to find min(|X|).

    Step 4: Find the minimal continuum.
    A continuum must be non-empty. The simplest possible non-empty space is a single-point space, let's call it X = {p}.
    - Is X = {p} a continuum?
      - Compact? Yes, any finite space is compact.
      - Connected? Yes, it cannot be separated into two disjoint non-empty open sets.
      - Hausdorff? Yes, vacuously. There are no distinct points to separate.
    So, a single-point space is a continuum.

    Step 5: Verify if this minimal continuum is aposyndetic.
    The definition of aposyndetic starts with: "for every two distinct points x, y in X...". In the space X = {p}, there are no distinct points. Therefore, the condition is vacuously true. The single-point space is aposyndetic.

    Step 6: State the conclusion.
    The smallest possible aposyndetic continuum is a single-point space, X = {p}.
    The cardinality of this space is |X| = 1.
    Since every point in an aposyndetic continuum is a non-block point, the cardinality of the set of non-block points is also 1.

    Final Equation:
    Let N be the set of non-block points.
    If X is aposyndetic, then N = X.
    The goal is to find min(|N|) = min(|X|).
    The smallest continuum X is a single point, so |X|_min = 1.
    Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points is 1.
