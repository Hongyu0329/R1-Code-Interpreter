# The user wants to find the sum of the first coordinate of the solutions to a system of matrix equations.
# The plan is to solve each equation for the matrix X, find the possible first coordinates, and then sum them up.

# Step 1: Analyze and solve the first equation for the first coordinate of X1.
# The first equation is:
# [[5, 0], [0, -5]] * X1^2 + X1^2 * [[6, 0], [0, 6]] = [[-53/12, 0], [0, 0]]
# This is a Sylvester-like equation of the form A*Y + Y*B = C, with Y = X1^2 and B = 6*I.
# It simplifies to (A + 6I)*Y = C.
# A + 6I = [[5+6, 0], [0, -5+6]] = [[11, 0], [0, 1]]
# So, [[11, 0], [0, 1]] * X1^2 = [[-53/12, 0], [0, 0]].
# Since the matrices are diagonal, we can solve for the elements of X1^2 directly.
# Let X1^2 = [[y1, 0], [0, y2]].
# 11 * y1 = -53/12  =>  y1 = -53/132
# 1 * y2 = 0      =>  y2 = 0
# So, X1^2 = [[-53/132, 0], [0, 0]].
# For a diagonal matrix, its square root is also diagonal. Let X1 = [[x, 0], [0, z]].
# x^2 = -53/132 => x = +/- sqrt(-53/132) = +/- i*sqrt(53/132).
# The two possible first coordinates for X1 are i*sqrt(53/132) and -i*sqrt(53/132).
frac1_num = 53
frac1_den = 132

# Step 2: Analyze and solve the second equation for the first coordinate of X2.
# The second equation is:
# [[4, 0], [0, -5]] * X2^2 + X2^2 * [[6, 0], [0, 6]] = [[-3/11, 0], [0, 0]]
# (A + 6I) = [[4+6, 0], [0, -5+6]] = [[10, 0], [0, 1]]
# So, [[10, 0], [0, 1]] * X2^2 = [[-3/11, 0], [0, 0]].
# Solving for the elements of X2^2:
# 10 * y1 = -3/11 => y1 = -3/110
# 1 * y2 = 0    => y2 = 0
# So, X2^2 = [[-3/110, 0], [0, 0]].
# Similarly, for X2 = [[x, 0], [0, z]]:
# x^2 = -3/110 => x = +/- sqrt(-3/110) = +/- i*sqrt(3/110).
# The two possible first coordinates for X2 are i*sqrt(3/110) and -i*sqrt(3/110).
frac2_num = 3
frac2_den = 110

# Step 3: Sum all the identified first coordinates.
# The four solutions for the first coordinates are:
# +i*sqrt(53/132), -i*sqrt(53/132), +i*sqrt(3/110), -i*sqrt(3/110)
# Their sum is 0.

# Step 4: Display the result as a final equation, showing each term.
term1 = f"i*sqrt({frac1_num}/{frac1_den})"
term2 = f"-i*sqrt({frac1_num}/{frac1_den})"
term3 = f"i*sqrt({frac2_num}/{frac2_den})"
term4 = f"-i*sqrt({frac2_num}/{frac2_den})"

# The sum is exactly zero.
total_sum = 0

print("The solutions for the first coordinate from the first equation are:")
print(f"x_1 = {term1} and x_2 = {term2}")
print("\nThe solutions for the first coordinate from the second equation are:")
print(f"x_3 = {term3} and x_4 = {term4}")
print("\nThe final equation for the sum of all these coordinates is:")
print(f"({term1}) + ({term2}) + ({term3}) + ({term4}) = {total_sum}")
