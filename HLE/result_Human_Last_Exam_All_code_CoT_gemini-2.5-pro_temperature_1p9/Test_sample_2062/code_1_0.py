# Part (a): The reasoning is based on the properties of similar matrices and diagonal matrices.
# Two diagonal matrices are similar if and only if they have the same multiset of eigenvalues.
# This is equivalent to having identical multiplicities for each eigenvalue.
answer_a = "Yes"

# Part (b): Calculate the number of similarity classes for n=3, q=3.
# The problem is to find the number of multisets of size n from k choices.
# The formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + k - 1, k - 1).
n_b = 3  # dimension of the matrix
q_b = 3  # number of distinct eigenvalues to choose from

# Calculate the parameters for the combination formula
comb_n = n_b + q_b - 1
comb_k = q_b - 1

# Calculate the result
answer_b = math.comb(comb_n, comb_k)

# Part (c): The reasoning is based on the nature of the growth of the formula from (b).
# For a fixed q, the number of classes, C(n+q-1, q-1), is a polynomial in n of degree q-1.
# Polynomial growth is not exponential.
answer_c = "No"

# Output the explanation for the calculation in part (b) as requested.
