# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a topology T on a set X can have,
# given that |X| = c (the cardinality of the continuum) and T is neither trivial nor discrete.

# Step 1: Understand the definitions.
# A topology S is a complement to T if:
# 1. The topology generated by the union (T U S) is the discrete topology.
# 2. The intersection (T intersect S) is the trivial topology {emptyset, X}.

# Step 2: Apply a known theorem from topology.
# A theorem by W. W. Comfort and S. Garcia-Ferreira states that for any non-trivial,
# non-discrete topology on an infinite set X, the number of complements is either 0 or at least 2^|X|.

# Step 3: Apply the theorem to the given set X.
# Here, |X| = c. So, the number of complements for any suitable topology T on X is either 0 or at least 2**c.

# Step 4: Show that topologies with a non-zero number of complements exist.
# It is possible to construct a topology T on X that has complements. An example is the "included set"
# topology, where for a partition X = A U B, T consists of all supersets of A. This topology can
# be shown to have at least 2**c complements.
# This confirms that the set of complement counts is not always 0, so the minimum is not 0 by default.

# Step 5: Conclude the minimum possible number.
# Since the number of complements is either 0 or at least 2**c, the smallest possible non-zero
# number of complements is 2**c.

# The final answer is the cardinality 2**c. We can express this using standard cardinal notation.
# The cardinality c is defined as 2**aleph_0.

aleph_0 = "aleph_0"
two = 2

# The cardinality of the set X is c
c_definition = f"{two}**{aleph_0}"

# The smallest possible number of complements is 2**c
result_cardinality_symbolic = f"{two}**c"
result_cardinality_expanded = f"{two}**({c_definition})"

print(f"The smallest possible number of complements is {result_cardinality_symbolic}.")
print(f"This is derived from a theorem stating the number of complements is either 0 or at least 2**|X|.")
print(f"Here, |X| = c, where c itself is the cardinality {c_definition}.")
print(f"Therefore, the final answer for the exact cardinality is {result_cardinality_expanded}.")
print(f"Each number in the final equation is: The base is {two}, and the exponent is the cardinality of the continuum c, which itself is {two} to the power of {aleph_0}.")
