explanation = """
The patient's clinical presentation, which includes short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and potential cardiovascular symptoms, is highly characteristic of Turner Syndrome. However, the finding of a normal 46,XX karyotype rules out the classic form of the syndrome.

This points to a molecular abnormality that mimics Turner Syndrome. The short stature aspect of Turner Syndrome is well-understood to be caused by haploinsufficiency (having only one functional copy) of the SHOX gene, located on the short arm of the X chromosome. A mutation or microdeletion involving the SHOX gene would explain the patient's short stature while being invisible to a standard karyotype test.
"""

final_answer = "A mutation or deletion in the SHOX (Short stature homeobox-containing) gene."
