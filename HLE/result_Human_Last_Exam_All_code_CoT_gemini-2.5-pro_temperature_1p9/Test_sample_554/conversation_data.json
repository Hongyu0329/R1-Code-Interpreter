    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we need to follow a clear plan:\n\n1.  **Define \"Perfluoronanocar\"**: This term implies a standard \"nanocar\" molecule where every hydrogen (H) atom on its hydrocarbon framework has been replaced by a fluorine (F) atom. The fullerene (C60) \"wheels\" are all-carbon and are not part of this substitution.\n2.  **Identify the Nanocar Structure**: We will use the chemical structure of the first 4-wheeled nanocar, as synthesized by the group of Prof. James Tour at Rice University (published in *Nano Letters*, 2005).\n3.  **Analyze the Framework**: The nanocar's chassis and axle framework consists of a central benzene ring connected to four \"arms\". Each arm is made of phenylene and ethynylene groups that link to the wheels.\n4.  **Count the Hydrogen Atoms**: We will count the hydrogen atoms on this hydrocarbon framework, which are the atoms available for replacement by fluorine.\n    *   The central core is a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₂), which has **2** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Each of the four arms contains a para-substituted phenylene group (C₆H₄), which has **4** hydrogen atoms.\n5.  **Calculate the Total**: The total number of hydrogens is the sum from the central ring and all four arms. This total equals the number of fluorine atoms in the final perfluorinated molecule.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step of the equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar\n    based on the structure of the first 4-wheeled nanocar.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan:\n    # 1.
