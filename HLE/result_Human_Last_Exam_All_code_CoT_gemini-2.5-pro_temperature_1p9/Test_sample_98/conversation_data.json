    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the shape of the water's surface:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Icosahedron's Properties**: An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. A key property is its central symmetry: for any point on its surface, there is an identical point on the opposite side, and the line connecting them passes through the center of the solid.\n\n2.  **Understand the Orientation**: The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the triangular faces is the horizontal base. In an icosahedron, the face opposite any given face is parallel to it. So, the top of the tank is also a triangle, parallel to the base.\n\n3.  **Interpret \"Half-Filled\"**: When a centrally symmetric object is filled to half its volume, the surface of the liquid must pass through the object's geometric center. Therefore, the water surface will be a horizontal plane cutting through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Determine the Cross-Sectional Shape**: The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by this central, horizontal plane. For an icosahedron oriented on one of its faces, the cross-section passing through its center and parallel to the base faces is a **regular hexagon**. This hexagon is formed by the plane intersecting the six faces that form the \"waist\" or \"equator\" of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**: The shape of the water surface will be a regular hexagon.\n\nThe Python code below will print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tank_shape():\n  \"\"\"\n  Determines and prints the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank.\n  \n  The reasoning is as follows:\n  1. An icosahedron has central symmetry.\n  2. A tank that is 'half-filled' with water means the water level is at a plane that\n     bisects the volume of the tank.\n  3. Due to central symmetry, this volume-bisecting plane must pass through the geometric center.\n  4. The tank is standing on a face, so the water surface is parallel to this face.\n  5. The cross-section of an icosahedron through its center and parallel to a face is a regular hexagon.\n  \"\"\"\n  shape = \"A regular hexagon\"\n  print(f\"When the icosahedron tank is half-filled, the shape of the water surface will be: {shape}.\")\n\nsolve_tank_shape()\n```\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
