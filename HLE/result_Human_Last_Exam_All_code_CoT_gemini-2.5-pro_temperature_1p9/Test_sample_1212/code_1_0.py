    This function solves the provided Go puzzle.

    The board state is as follows:
    - Black stones: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    - White stones: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5

    It's White's move. The task is to find all first moves for White
    that guarantee a kill of the Black stones.

    Analysis shows the Black stones are separated into three weak groups
    with five shared external liberties: A1, A3, A4, B1, and B2.
    Playing on any of these five points initiates a capture sequence
    that Black cannot escape, regardless of Black's responses.
    White can systematically reduce liberties and prevent Black from forming a living shape.
    
    Therefore, all five points are valid killing moves.
    """

    killing_moves = ["A1", "A3", "A4", "B1", "B2"]

    # Sort the list for a canonical representation.
    killing_moves.sort()

    # The problem asks for the list to be in curly brackets, delineated with commas.
    # We will construct the output string accordingly.
    # The instructions also mentioned "output each number in the final equation!", which
    # is interpreted as outputting each coordinate in the final list.
