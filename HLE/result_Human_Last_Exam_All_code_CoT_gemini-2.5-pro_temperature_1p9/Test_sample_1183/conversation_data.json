    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule from its SMILES string, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Parse SMILES String**: The first step is to convert the given SMILES string into a molecular structure that can be manipulated. I will use the RDKit library, a powerful toolkit for cheminformatics, to handle this conversion.\n2.  **Generate a 3D Conformation**: Symmetry is a property of a molecule's 3D arrangement of atoms. I will generate a 3D conformation from the parsed SMILES string. This includes adding hydrogen atoms to ensure a realistic molecular structure.\n3.  **Optimize the Geometry**: The initial 3D structure might not be in its most stable energy state. I will use the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF94), a method for geometry optimization, to find a low-energy, stable conformer. For this planar-looking molecule, optimization should result in a structure that clearly expresses its inherent symmetry.\n4.  **Analyze Symmetry**: With an optimized 3D structure, I will use the Pymatgen library, which is typically used for materials science but has excellent tools for symmetry analysis. I will extract the atom types and their 3D coordinates from the RDKit molecule object and feed them into Pymatgen's `PointGroupAnalyzer`.\n5.  **Determine and Print the Point Group**: The `PointGroupAnalyzer` will compute the symmetry operations that leave the molecule unchanged and identify the corresponding Schönflies symbol for the point group. The final result will then be printed.\n\nThis automated, code-based approach ensures an accurate and reproducible determination of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n    import pymatgen.core as mg\n    from pymatgen.symmetry.analyzer import PointGroupAnalyzer\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the 'rdkit-pypi' and 'pymatgen' packages.\")\n    print(\"Please install them, for example using pip: 'pip install rdkit-pypi pymatgen'\")\n    exit()\n\ndef get_molecule_point_group(smiles_string: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the point group of a molecule from its SMILES string.\n\n    Args:\n        smiles_string: The SMILES representation of the molecule.\n\n    Returns:\n        The Schönflies symbol of the point group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
