    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n*   **Step 1: Define the Barbell Graph Structure.**\n    A barbell graph with 10 nodes is created by joining two separate 5-node complete graphs (K5 cliques) with a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the bottleneck.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Degrees of the Bottleneck Nodes.**\n    We need to calculate the degree (i.e., the number of connections) for each of the two nodes that are connected by the bottleneck edge. Let's call these nodes `u` and `v`.\n    *   Each of these nodes (`u` and `v`) is part of a 5-node clique, where it is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique.\n    *   Additionally, each node is connected to the other via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of both `u` and `v` is `(5 - 1) + 1 = 5`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply the Uniform Gossiping Probability Formula.**\n    In randomized uniform gossiping, the process for sampling an edge `(u, v)` involves two possibilities:\n    1.  Node `u` is selected (with probability `1/N`) and then chooses neighbor `v` (with probability `1/d(u)`).\n    2.  Node `v` is selected (with probability `1/N`) and then chooses neighbor `u` (with probability `1/d(v)`).\n    The total probability is the sum of these two events:\n    `P(u,v) = (1/N * 1/d(u)) + (1/N * 1/d(v))` which can be simplified to `P(u,v) = (1/N) * (1/d(u) + 1/d(v))`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Final Probability.**\n    We will plug in the values: `N=10` (total nodes), `d(u)=5`, and `d(v)=5`. The python code will compute this and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the barbell graph and the gossiping process\ntotal_nodes = 10\nnodes_in_clique = 5\n\n# Calculate the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n# Each node is connected to (nodes_in_clique - 1) nodes in its own clique,\n# plus 1 connection for the bottleneck edge itself.\ndegree_of_bottleneck_node_u = (nodes_in_clique - 1) + 1\ndegree_of_bottleneck_node_v = (nodes_in_clique - 1) + 1\n\n# The probability P(u,v) of sampling the edge (u, v) is given by:\n# P(u,v) = (1/N) * (1/d(u) + 1/d(v))\n# where N is the total number of nodes, and d(u) and d(v) are the degrees.\nprobability = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node_u + 1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node_v)\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in\nprint(\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (u,v) is calculated with the formula:\")\nprint(\"P(u,v) = (1 / Total Nodes) * (1 / degree(u) + 1 / degree(v))\")\nprint(\"\\nHere is the calculation with the specific numbers for this graph:\")\nprint(f\"(1 / {total_nodes}) * (1 / {degree_of_bottleneck_node_u} + 1 / {degree_of_bottleneck_node_v}) = {probability}\")\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
