    # 1. Define the variable for the Poincaré polynomial.
    # The Poincaré polynomial P_X(t) of a space X is defined as sum(b_k(X) * t^k),

    # 2. Define the Poincaré polynomial of the fiber.

    # P is the complement of a hyperplane arrangement in the 3-dimensional
    # quaternionic projective space HP^3.
    # A theorem in topology states that the cohomology of a complement of
    # hyperplanes in a space like HP^n vanishes above dimension n.
    # For P, which is in HP^3, this means its Betti numbers b_k(P) are 0 for k > 3.

    # For an S^3-fibration with a trivial Euler class over the rationals (which holds here

    # is the product of the polynomials of the fiber and the base.
