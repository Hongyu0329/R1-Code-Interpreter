# (a) True or False: Degree of a vertex in the SQS(2v) is v-1?
# The degree of a vertex in the original SQS(v) ND-pair graph.
d_v = (v - 1) * (v - 2) / 6
# The degree in the constructed SQS(2v) under a canonical construction.
d_2v = d_v + (v - 1)
# The statement asks if d_2v is equal to v - 1.
# We check if d_2v - (v-1) is zero for v >= 4.
is_degree_v_minus_1 = sympy.simplify(d_2v - (v - 1)) == 0
# is_degree_v_minus_1 is d_v == 0, which means (v-1)(v-2)/6 = 0.
# This holds for v=1 or v=2, but the problem states v >= 4.
# So for v >= 4, the statement is False.
answer_a = "False"

# (b) What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)}?
# Let mu be the original multiplicity of {x,y}.
# In the described construction, the multiplicity of {(x,0), (y,0)} is inherited
# directly from the original ND-pair {x,y} via Type 1 blocks.
# Type 2 blocks with vertical pairing do not add to this multiplicity.
# Hence, the new multiplicity is mu.
answer_b = "mu" # Represented as a string, as it's a symbolic expression

# (c) Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v?
# The multiplicity of horizontal pairs is mu = (v-2)/6 for some systems. This is not v.
# The multiplicity of vertical pairs {(x,0), (x,1)} is v-1. This is not v.
# No standard part of the construction yields multiplicity v.
answer_c = "No"

# We must print the results in the final output format.
# Let's use mu as the variable name for the symbolic expression in (b).
mu_symbol = sympy.Symbol('mu')

print(f"(a) {answer_a}; (b) {mu_symbol}; (c) {answer_c}.")

# Although the final output format should not have a code block,
# the instructions ask me to provide code. I will print the components
# of the answer separately, as requested by the persona instructions.
# "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# There are no numerical equations in this problem, but symbolic ones.
