    "This is a fascinating problem from the field of convex geometry and number theory. Let's break down the derivation of the minimal area step by step.\n\n### My thinking process:\n\n1.  **Understand the set of lines:** The problem specifies lines `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. This means `gcd(p, q) = 1`. This set includes fundamental lines like `x=1` (p=1, q=0), `y=1` (p=0, q=1), `x=-1` (p=-1, q=0), `y=-1` (p=0, q=-1), as well as rotated lines like `x+y=1` (p=1, q=1), and infinitely many others.\n\n2.  **Define the condition on the convex domain `K`:** The convex domain `K` must intersect every single one of these lines. A convex set `K` intersects a line `L` if it's not contained entirely in one of the open half-planes defined by `L`.\n\n3.  **Find a lower bound for the area:**\n    *   Let's consider two specific pairs of lines from the set: `x=1` and `x=-1`. For `K` to intersect both, it must have points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` such that `x1 >= 1` and `x2 <= -1`. The distance between the vertical lines supporting `K` is its width in the x-direction, `w_x`. This means `w_x >= 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   Similarly, using the lines `y=1` and `y=-1`, the width of `K` in the y-direction, `w_y`, must be at least `2`.\n    *   There is a known inequality in geometry that relates the area of a convex set to its widths along two perpendicular directions: `Area(K) >= (1/2) * w_x * w_y`.\n    *   Applying this inequality, we get `Area(K) >= (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`. This establishes a lower bound for the area: the minimal area must be at least 2.\n\n4.  **Find a candidate shape:** Now, we need to find a convex domain `K` that satisfies the condition and has an area of exactly 2. If we find one, we've found our minimal area.\n    *   Let's test the square defined by `|x| + |y| <= 1`. This is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. Its area is `2`.\n    *   Does this shape intersect all lines `px + qy = 1` where `gcd(p, q) = 1`?\n    *   A closed, centrally-symmetric convex body `K` intersects the line `px+qy=1` if and only if its support function `h_K(p,q) = sup(px+qy for (x,y) in K)` is greater than or equal to 1.\n    *   For the square `|x|+|y| <= 1`, the support function `h_K(p,q)` is `max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    *   The condition is `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`. Since `p` and `q` are coprime, they cannot both be zero. If one is zero (e.g., `p=0`), the other must be `+/-1` (so `|q|=1`), making the maximum at least 1. If neither is zero, their absolute values are at least 1, so the maximum is at least 1.\n    *   The condition holds for all `p,q` coprime.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We've established a lower bound of 2 for the area and found a shape that meets this bound and satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\nHere is a Python script to formalize and demonstrate this reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_minimal_area_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the solution to find the minimal area of a convex domain\n    that intersects all lines px+qy=1 for coprime integers p and q.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the constraints on the convex domain K.\")\n    print(\"The domain K must intersect px+qy=1 for all coprime integers p,q.\")\n    \n    # Consider specific lines to derive width constraints.\n    # For (p,q) = (1,0), we have the line x = 1.\n    # For (p,q) = (-1,0), we have the line x = -1.\n    # For K to intersect both, its width along the x-axis (w_x) must be at least 2.\n    px1, qy1 = 1, 0\n    c1 = 1\n    px2, qy2 = -1, 0\n    c2 = -1\n    w_x_min = c1 - c2\n    print(f\"\\n- Using lines ({px1})x+({qy1})y={c1} and ({px2})x+({qy2})y={c1}, we find the minimum width in x-direction.\")\n    print(f\"  w_x >= {c1} - ({c2}) = {w_x_min}\")\n    \n    # Similarly for the y-direction.\n    # For (p,q) = (0,1), we have the line y = 1.\n    # For (p,q) = (0,-1), we have the line y = -1.\n    px3, qy3 = 0, 1\n    c3 = 1\n    px4, qy4 = 0, -1\n    c4 = -1\n    w_y_min = c3 - c4\n    print(f\"- Using lines ({px3})x+({qy3})y={c3} and ({px4})x+({qy4})y={c4}, we find the minimum width in y-direction.\")\n    print(f\"  w_y >= {c3} - ({c4}) = {w_y_min}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Finding a lower bound for the area of K.\")\n    # Using the geometric inequality Area(K) >= 0.5 * w_x * w_y\n    # This inequality holds for any convex set K.\n    print(\"A known geometric inequality states: Area(K) >= (1/2) * w_x * w_y.\")\n    \n    half = 0.5\n    area_lower_bound = half * w_x_min * w_y_min\n    \n    print(\"Substituting the minimum widths into the inequality:\")\n    print(f\"Area(K) >= {half} * {w_x_min} * {w_y_min}\")\n    print(f\"Area(K) >= {area_lower_bound}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis means the minimal area must be at least 2.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Finding a candidate convex domain with area 2.\")\n    print(\"Consider the square region K_0 defined by |x| + |y| <= 1.\")\n    print(\"This is a square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1).\")\n    side_length = math.sqrt(2)\n    candidate_area = 2.0 \n    print(f\"The area of this square is exactly {candidate_area}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Verify that K_0 satisfies the condition for all lines.\")\n    print(\"For K_0 to intersect px+qy=1, its support function h(p,q) must be >= 1.\")\n    print(\"The support function for |x|+|y|<=1 is h(p,q) = max(|p|, |q|).\")\n    print(\"The condition is max(|p|, |q|) >= 1 for all coprime integers p, q.\")\n    print(\"Since gcd(p,q)=1, p and q cannot both be 0.\")\n    print(\" - If p=0, then |q|=1, so max(|p|,|q|)=1.\")\n    print(\" - If q=0, then |p|=1, so max(|p|,|q|)=1.\")\n    print(\" - If p!=0 and q!=0, then |p|>=1 and |q|>=1, so max(|p|,|q|)>=1.\")\n    print(\"The condition holds.
