    "Here is my plan to find the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid:\n1.  I will first research and compile a list of rivers that are mentioned by name in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid.\n2.  Next, I will find the modern-day accepted lengths of these rivers in kilometers.\n3.  Then, I will create a Python script to store this data in a dictionary, with river names as keys and their lengths as values.\n4.  Finally, the script will sort the rivers by length in descending order and print the top three longest rivers along with their lengths.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n    It stores a list of rivers from the epic and their approximate modern lengths,\n    sorts them, and prints the top three.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their lengths in km.\n    # The list includes major world rivers referenced in the text.\n    rivers_in_aeneid = {\n        \"Nile\": 6650,\n        \"Indus (represented by its tributary Hydaspes)\": 3180,\n        \"Danube (Ister)\": 2850,\n        \"Euphrates\": 2800,\n        \"Ganges\": 2525,\n        \"Tigris\": 1850,\n        \"Rhine\": 1233,\n        \"Araxes\": 1072,\n        \"Po (Eridanus)\": 652,\n        \"Tiber\": 406,\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary items by length (the value) in descending order.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers_in_aeneid.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers.\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_longest_rivers()\n```\n<<<\nThe three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\n1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
