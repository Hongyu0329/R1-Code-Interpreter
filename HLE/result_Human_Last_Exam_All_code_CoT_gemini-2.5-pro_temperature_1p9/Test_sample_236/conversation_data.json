    "This problem requires knowledge from low-dimensional topology, specifically about knots and the homology cobordism group of 3-spheres. We can solve this by systematically listing the knots, determining the results of surgery, and identifying the unique elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify Knots:** List all knots with a crossing number of four or less. These are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). Note that the trefoil knot is chiral (it is different from its mirror image), while the unknot and figure-eight knot are amphichiral (they are the same as their mirror images).\n2.  **Identify Surgeries:** The problem specifies integral surgery. For the resulting 3-manifold to be a homology sphere (a necessary condition to be in the homology cobordism group), we must perform ±1 surgery.\n3.  **Determine Resulting Manifolds:** For each knot and surgery type (e.g., +1 surgery on the trefoil knot), we identify the resulting 3-manifold.\n4.  **Find Homology Cobordism Classes:** We map each resulting manifold to its corresponding element (class) in the homology cobordism group. This involves using known topological facts:\n    *   ±1 surgery on the unknot yields the 3-sphere S³, which is the identity element in the group.\n    *   -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil (and on the figure-eight knot) results in the famous Poincaré homology sphere.\n    *   The surgery on a knot's mirror image results in the inverse element.\n    *   The Poincaré sphere is an element of order 2, meaning it is its own inverse in the group.\n5.  **Count Unique Elements:** We collect all the generated elements and count the number of unique ones based on these topological facts. The final answer is this count.\n\nThe following Python code systematically implements this plan. It uses symbolic names for the elements and applies the known relations to find the final unique count.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements representable\n    by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n    The logic relies on established results from low-dimensional topology.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"\\\n    Analyzing integral surgeries on knots with <= 4 crossings to find the number of\n    representable elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\n    The knots with at most 4 crossings are:\n    - 0_1 (the unknot)\n    - 3_1 (the trefoil knot)\n    - 4_1 (the figure-eight knot)\n\n    For the result of an integral p/q surgery on a knot K to be a homology sphere,\n    we must have |p|=1.
