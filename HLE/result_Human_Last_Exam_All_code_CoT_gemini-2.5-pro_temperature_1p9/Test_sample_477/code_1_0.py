    This function explains the role of LIG1 in CTG somatic instability

    # Step 1: Define the problem.
    # Myotonic dystrophy is caused by an expanding CTG repeat. This repeat is unstable
    # in somatic cells, meaning it tends to grow longer over an individual's lifetime,
    # worsening the disease. This is called somatic instability.
    print("Step 1: Myotonic dystrophy involves an unstable, expanding CTG repeat tract.")

    # Step 2: Explain the proposed mechanism of expansion.
    # The instability is thought to arise during DNA replication on the lagging strand.
    # The CTG repeats can fold into hairpin structures, which are processed during the
    # maturation of Okazaki fragments.
    print("Step 2: The expansion is believed to happen during the processing of Okazaki fragments on the DNA lagging strand.")

    # Step 3: Explain the role of LIG1.
    # DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1) is the main enzyme that seals the nicks between Okazaki
    # fragments to create a continuous DNA strand. Its action is the final step in
    # Okazaki fragment maturation.
    print("Step 3: LIG1 is the primary enzyme that joins Okazaki fragments together.")

    # Step 4: Combine the concepts to determine the impact.
    # The standard LIG1-dependent pathway for processing Okazaki fragments is what allows
    # the CTG repeat hairpins to be converted into expansions. Therefore, if LIG1 is
    # absent or reduced, this pathway is crippled.
    #
    # Experimental evidence from mouse models confirms this: reducing the amount of LIG1
    # protein leads to a dramatic decrease in the somatic expansion of the CTG repeats.
    # The repeat tract becomes much more stable.
    print("Step 4: Interfering with LIG1 disrupts the pathway that causes the expansions. Experimental data shows that reducing LIG1 levels leads to a more stable CTG repeat tract.")

    # Step 5: Conclude with the final answer.
    # The impact of knocking out (or reducing) LIG1 is a reduction in somatic instability.
    print("\nConclusion: The impact of knocking out LIG1 on CTG somatic instability is a reduction of that instability.")
    print("\nFinal Answer Choice: C")
