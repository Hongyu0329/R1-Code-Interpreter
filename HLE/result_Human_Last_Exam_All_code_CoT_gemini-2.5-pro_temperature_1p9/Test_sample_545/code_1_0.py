# The user wants the IUPAC name for the major product of a tandem chemical reaction.
# The reaction involves a sulfoxide elimination followed by a Claisen rearrangement.
#
# Step 1: Sulfoxide Elimination
# Reactant: Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-O-C(Me)2-CH=CH2
# Intermediate Product: CH2=CH-O-C(Me)2-CH=CH2 (a vinyl allyl ether)
#
# Step 2: Claisen Rearrangement
# Intermediate: CH2=CH-O-C(Me)2-CH=CH2
# Final Product: OHC-CH2-CH2-CH=C(Me)2
#
# Step 3: IUPAC Naming
# The final product is an aldehyde: OHC(1)-CH2(2)-CH2(3)-CH(4)=C(5)(Me)2
# - Parent chain: 5 carbons with an aldehyde -> pentanal
# - Double bond at position 4 -> pent-4-enal
# - Two methyl groups at position 5 -> 5,5-dimethyl
# The complete IUPAC name is 5,5-dimethylpent-4-enal.

final_iupac_name = "5,5-dimethylpent-4-enal"

# The following line prints the IUPAC name including all the numbers in the name.
