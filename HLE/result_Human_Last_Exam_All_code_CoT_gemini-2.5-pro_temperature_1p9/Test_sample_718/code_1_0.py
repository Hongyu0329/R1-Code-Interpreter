    print(" - An 'upper semilattice J' is a type of partially ordered set (poset). In the context of tame/wild representation theory, it is standard to assume that J is a finite poset.")
    print(" - A 'functor f: J -> Vect_K' is a representation of the poset J.")
    print(" - The term 'tame' describes the representation type of the entire category of functors for J. It means the indecomposable representations can be classified in a structured manner. The question is interpreted as: For a poset J of tame representation type, what is the resolution length 'n' for its functors?")
    print(" - 'n-resolvable' means that a functor f has a finite projective resolution of length at most n. We are looking for the maximum n that holds for any such functor that admits a finite resolution.\n")

    # --- Step 2: The Core Theorem ---
    print("Step 2: Stating the Key Theorem")
    print("---------------------------------")
    print("A fundamental theorem connects the representation type of a poset to its homological algebra properties. The algebra associated with the poset J is called the category algebra KJ.")
    print("\n  Theorem: A finite poset J is of tame representation type if and only if its\n           category algebra KJ is a 1-Gorenstein algebra.\n")

    # --- Step 3: Consequence of the Theorem ---
    print("Step 3: Understanding the 1-Gorenstein Property")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("An algebra A is 1-Gorenstein if its injective dimension as a module over itself is at most 1.")
    print("A critical property of 1-Gorenstein algebras is that any module M (in our case, a functor f) which has a finite projective dimension must have a projective dimension of at most 1.")
    print("So, for any functor f, if its projective dimension pd(f) is finite, then pd(f) <= 1.")
    print("The same property holds for injective dimensions.\n")

    # --- Step 4: Conclusion ---
    print("Step 4: Deriving the Final Answer")
    print("-----------------------------------")
    print("Since a functor f is 'n-resolvable' (has a projective resolution of length at most n), the properties of the 1-Gorenstein algebra KJ imply that the maximum possible length for such a finite resolution is 1.")
    print("Therefore, the value of n is 1.")
