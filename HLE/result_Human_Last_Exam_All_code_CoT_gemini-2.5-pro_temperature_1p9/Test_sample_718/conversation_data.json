    "Of course. This is a question in the representation theory of algebras. Here is a Python script that outlines the step-by-step reasoning to find the value of `n`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Clarify the terms**: I will first interpret the mathematical terms in the question, such as \"upper semilattice\", \"tame functor\", and \"n-resolvable\", within the standard context of representation theory. This involves assuming the semilattice `J` is finite, which is typical for discussions of tameness.\n2.  **State the key theorem**: I will state the central theorem that connects the \"tame\" representation type of a poset algebra to its homological properties. Specifically, this relates tameness to the concept of being a \"1-Gorenstein algebra\".\n3.  **Explain the consequences**: I will explain what being a 1-Gorenstein algebra implies for the projective (or injective) resolutions of modules (functors in this case).\n4.  **Conclude the value of n**: Based on the implications from the theorem, I will deduce the value of `n`. The Python script will then print this final conclusion and the resulting equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_representation_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves a theoretical problem in representation theory by explaining\n    the logical steps and deriving the answer based on established theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction and Plan ---\n    print(\"This script determines the value of 'n' for which a tame functor is n-resolvable.\")\n    print(\"The solution is derived from key results in the representation theory of posets.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Clarifying the Terms ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Interpreting the Mathematical Terms\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\" - An 'upper semilattice J' is a type of partially ordered set (poset).
