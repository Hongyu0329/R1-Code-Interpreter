    "Of course, I can help you with that. The integral you've presented is a fascinating one that connects to a well-known mathematical identity. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Summand**: The infinite sum inside the integral, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$, can be simplified using a famous product identity.\n2.  **Transform the Integral**: This simplification will transform the original integral into a different, more standard form, $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x$.\n3.  **Evaluate the Integral**: The value of this new integral is a known result in mathematics, $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. A formal proof is quite advanced, but we can verify the result numerically.\n4.  **Numerical Verification**: I will write a Python script that computes the integral numerically by summing the contributions over the intervals where the integrand is defined. This will confirm the known value of $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The script will also print the individual numbers that make up the final symbolic answer, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the integral by first simplifying the summand and then\n    numerically evaluating the resulting integral.\n    \n    The original integral is I = integral from 0 to inf of sum from n=1 to inf of log(cos(x/2^n)) dx.\n    The sum simplifies to log(sin(x)/x).\n    So, I = integral from 0 to inf of log(sin(x)/x) dx.\n\n    The logarithm is real-valued only when sin(x)/x > 0. For x > 0, this occurs\n    on the intervals (2k*pi, (2k+1)*pi) for k = 0, 1, 2, ...\n    \n    The value of this integral is known to be -pi/2.\n    We will verify this numerically.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def integrand(x):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates log(sin(x)/x).\n        The integral is split into intervals where sin(x) > 0.\n        This function is designed to be integrated by scipy.quad.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Near x=0, use Taylor expansion for numerical stability.\n        # log(sin(x)/x) ~ log(1 - x^2/6) ~ -x^2/6\n        if x < 1e-6:\n            return -x**2 / 6.0\n        \n        # We only integrate where sin(x) > 0.
