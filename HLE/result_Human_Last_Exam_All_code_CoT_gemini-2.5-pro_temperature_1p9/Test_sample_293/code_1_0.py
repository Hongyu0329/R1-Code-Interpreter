    This function solves the integral by first simplifying the summand and then
    numerically evaluating the resulting integral.
    
    The original integral is I = integral from 0 to inf of sum from n=1 to inf of log(cos(x/2^n)) dx.
    The sum simplifies to log(sin(x)/x).
    So, I = integral from 0 to inf of log(sin(x)/x) dx.

    The logarithm is real-valued only when sin(x)/x > 0. For x > 0, this occurs
    on the intervals (2k*pi, (2k+1)*pi) for k = 0, 1, 2, ...
    
    The value of this integral is known to be -pi/2.
    We will verify this numerically.
