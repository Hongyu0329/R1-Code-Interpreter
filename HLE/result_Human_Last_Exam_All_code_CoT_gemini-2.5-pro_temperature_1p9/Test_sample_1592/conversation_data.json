    "To determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I will get the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish, Quebec.\n2.  Next, I will identify the neighboring provinces and territories. Given Waskaganish's location on James Bay, the closest neighbors are Ontario (to the west and south) and Nunavut (the islands within James Bay).\n3.  I will then find the coordinates of the nearest points in both Ontario and Nunavut. For Ontario, this will be a point on its coastline across James Bay. For Nunavut, it will be a point on Akimiski Island, the largest and closest island in James Bay.\n4.  Finally, I will use the Haversine formula to calculate the great-circle distance between Waskaganish and these points. The province or territory with the smaller distance will be the answer. The code will print the comparison and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2 = map(math.radians, [lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2])\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2 - lon1\n    dlat = lat2 - lat1\n    a = math.sin(dlat/2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon/2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.asin(math.sqrt(a))\n    # Radius of earth in kilometers. Use 6371 for kilometers\n    r = 6371\n    return c * r\n\n# Coordinates\n# Waskaganish, Quebec is located at approximately 51.48° N, 78.76° W\nwaskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon = 51.48, -78.76\n\n# The nearest point in Ontario is across James Bay, for example, the community of Moosonee\nontario_point_name = \"Moosonee, Ontario\"\nontario_lat, ontario_lon = 51.27, -80.64\n\n# The nearest point in Nunavut is Akimiski Island in James Bay\nnunavut_point_name = \"Akimiski Island, Nunavut\"\nnunavut_lat, nunavut_lon = 53.00, -81.33\n\n\n# Calculate distances\ndist_to_ontario = haversine(waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, ontario_lat, ontario_lon)\ndist_to_nunavut = haversine(waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, nunavut_lat, nunavut_lon)\n\nprint(f\"Finding the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, QC...\")\nprint(f\"Coordinates for Waskaganish, QC: ({waskaganish_lat:.2f} N, {abs(waskaganish_lon):.2f} W)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Distance to {ontario_point_name}: {dist_to_ontario:.2f} km\")\nprint(f\"Distance to {nunavut_point_name}: {dist_to_nunavut:.2f} km\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nif dist_to_ontario < dist_to_nunavut:\n    print(f\"{ontario_point_name} is closer than {nunavut_point_name}.\")\n    closest_province_territory = \"Ontario\"\nelse:\n    print(f\"{nunavut_point_name} is closer than {ontario_point_name}.\")\n    closest_province_territory = \"Nunavut\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_province_territory}.\")\n<<<Ontario>>>\n```"
