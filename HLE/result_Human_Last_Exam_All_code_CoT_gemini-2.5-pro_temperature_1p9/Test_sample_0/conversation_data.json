    "My plan is to demonstrate how critical-level views in population ethics violate one of the specific conditions listed. I will write a Python script to model this violation.\n\n1.  **Define Critical-Level View:** A population's value is the sum of each individual's welfare *minus a positive \"critical level\"*. Adding a person is only good if their welfare is above this critical level.\n2.  **Define the Conditions:** I will focus on the **Non-Elitism** condition. This condition states that there is no \"elite\" level of welfare so high that one person enjoying it is better than any number of people enjoying a slightly lower level of welfare.\n3.  **Construct a Scenario:** I will create a scenario with two populations to compare:\n    *   **Population A:** A single person whose welfare is just slightly *above* the critical level.\n    *   **Population B:** An arbitrarily large population of people whose welfare is just slightly *below* the critical level.\n4.  **Calculate and Compare:** The script will calculate the total value of Population A and Population B using the critical-level rule.\n5.  **Show the Violation:** The script's output will show that, according to the critical-level view, Population A is *always* considered better than Population B, no matter how large Population B gets. This demonstrates that the welfare level just above the critical mark acts as an \"elite\" level, thus violating the Non-Elitism condition.\n\n```python\ndef explain_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates how Critical-Level Views violate the\n    Non-Elitism condition of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Define the parameters for our model of a critical-level view.\n    critical_level = 20  # The welfare level a new life must exceed to be a net positive.\n    epsilon = 0.01         # A very small amount of welfare.\n    large_N = 1000000      # Represents an arbitrarily large number of people.\n\n    # 2. Define the Non-Elitism condition (in plain English).\n    # Non-Elitism: There is NO \"elite\" welfare level such that one person at that level\n    # is better than ANY number of people at a slightly lower level.\n\n    # 3. We create two populations to test this condition.\n    #    Population A has one person at a proposed \"elite\" level (just above critical).\n    #    Population B has many people at a \"lower\" level (just below critical).\n    welfare_A = critical_level + epsilon\n    welfare_B = critical_level - epsilon\n\n    # 4.
