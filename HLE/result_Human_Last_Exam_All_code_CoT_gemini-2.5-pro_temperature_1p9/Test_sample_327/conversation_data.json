    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces in the Red-Blue Hackenbush game that represents the number $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Representing Numbers as Games**: In combinatorial game theory, numbers can be represented by games. The number `x` is represented by the game `{L | R}` where `L` and `R` are sets of numbers corresponding to the game states the Left and Right players can move to, respectively. For any `x_L` in `L` and `x_R` in `R`, the condition `x_L < x < x_R` must hold. The simplest representation for a dyadic rational (a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator) `x = m / 2^k` where `m` is odd, is `{x - 1/2^k | x + 1/2^k}`.\n\n2.  **From Games to Hackenbush**: A game `{L | R}` can be constructed in Hackenbush. It consists of a base point connected by a red piece (Left's move) to the game representing `L` and a blue piece (Right's move) to the game representing `R`. Therefore, if we have a single option for each player, `{x_L | x_R}`, the number of pieces required to represent this game, `N(x)`, is `N(x_L) + N(x_R) + 2` (one red piece and one blue piece, plus the pieces for the sub-games).\n\n3.  **Recursive Calculation**:\n    *   For our number $\\frac{13}{16}$, the game is `{ \\frac{13}{16} - \\frac{1}{16} | \\frac{13}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} } = \\{ \\frac{12}{16} | \\frac{14}{16} \\} = \\{ \\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8} \\}$.\n    *   Thus, the number of pieces, `N(13/16)`, is `N(3/4) + N(7/8) + 2`.\n    *   We can apply this logic recursively. If we have a fraction `m/2^k` where `m` is even, we first simplify it to `(m/2)/2^(k-1)`.\n\n4.  **Base Cases**: The recursion needs to stop.\n    *   The game for the number 0 has a value of 0 and requires 0 pieces. `N(0) = 0`.\n    *   The game for a positive integer `n` can be represented by a simple stack of `n` red pieces. Thus, `N(1) = 1`, `N(2) = 2`, etc.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: We can write a Python function that uses this recursion with memoization (caching results to avoid re-computation) to calculate the final number of pieces.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Increase the recursion limit for deep calculations, although memoization helps avoid this.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# A dictionary to store results of subproblems to avoid re-calculation.\nmemo = {}\n\ndef get_pieces(m, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively calculates the number of pieces for the number m / 2^k.\n    m: numerator\n    k: the power of 2 in the denominator (i.e., denominator is 2**k)\n    \"\"\"\n    # If the result is already computed, return it.\n    if (m, k) in memo:\n        return memo[(m, k)]\n\n    # Base case: N(0) = 0\n    if m == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Base case: N(n) for integer n.\n    # N(m/2^k) = N(n) if m = n * 2^k. So if k=0, it's just N(m).\n    # We will only need N(1) which is 1 piece.\n    if k == 0:\n        return m # N(m) = m for integers\n\n    # If the numerator m is even, simplify the fraction first.\n    # N(m/2^k) = N((m/2)/(2^(k-1)))\n    if m % 2 == 0:\n        result = get_pieces(m // 2, k - 1)\n    else:\n        # If m is odd, use the recursive formula:\n        # N(m/2^k) = N((m-1)/2^k) + N((m+1)/2^k) + 2\n        # Note: (m-1) and (m+1) are both even.\n        left_pieces = get_pieces(m - 1, k)\n        right_pieces = get_pieces(m + 1, k)\n        result = left_pieces + right_pieces + 2\n\n    # Store the result before returning.\n    memo[(m, k)] = result\n    return result\n\n# The number we are interested in is 13/16.\n# So, m = 13 and the denominator is 16 = 2^4, so k = 4.\nnumerator = 13\ndenominator_power = 4\n\ntotal_pieces = get_pieces(numerator, denominator_power)\n\nprint(f\"To represent the number {numerator}/{2**denominator_power}, we can use the game {{ {numerator-1}/{2**denominator_power} | {numerator+1}/{2**denominator_power} }} = {{ {int((numerator-1)/4)}/{int(2**denominator_power/4)} | {int((numerator+1)/2)}/{int(2**denominator_power/2)} }}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of pieces for N({numerator}/{2**denominator_power}) is recursively calculated as N({(numerator-1)//4}/{2**(denominator_power-2)}) + N({(numerator+1)//2}/{2**(denominator_power-1)}) + 2.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of red or blue pieces needed is {total_pieces}.\")\n```\n<<<17>>>"
