# This script calculates the three-digit code based on the analysis of the MIS algorithm's runtime.

# --- Analysis Summary ---
# f_1(n): Runtime for a cycle of length n.
# f_2(n): Runtime for any tree on n vertices of degree at most 100.
# f_3(n): Runtime for any graph on n vertices of degree at most 100.

# 1. For a cycle C_n, the graph has a large girth (n). This allows the graph
# to shatter into O(log n)-sized components in one step w.h.p. The subsequent
# runtime is O(log(log n)). Thus, f_1(n) = Theta(log log n).
# This corresponds to category 5.
d1 = 5

# 2. For a tree, the girth is infinite. Similar to the cycle, the graph shatters
# into O(log n)-sized components after one step. The subsequent runtime is O(log(log n)).
# Thus, f_2(n) = Theta(log log n).
# This corresponds to category 5.
d2 = 5

# 3. For a general graph with bounded degree, short cycles can prevent shattering.
# The standard analysis for Luby's algorithm guarantees termination in O(log n) steps.
# This bound is tight, as there are Omega(log n) lower bounds.
# Thus, f_3(n) = Theta(log n).
# This corresponds to category 9.
d3 = 9

# The problem asks for the three-digit code d1, d2, d3.
# The following print statements show the derived categories and the final code.
