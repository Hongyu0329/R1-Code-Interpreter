    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $g=6$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the conductor $d$**: We start by finding the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if its component characters are primitive. For a square-free conductor $d=p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$, a character $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\cdots \\chi_{p_r}$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-trivial (i.e., not the principal character).\n\n2.  **Analyze the order $g$**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1}), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_r}))$. We are given that this must be $g=6$.\n\n3.  **Count the component characters**: For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of non-trivial characters modulo $p$ whose order divides an integer $k$ is given by $\\gcd(k, p-1) - 1$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**: We need to count the number of tuples of non-trivial component characters $(\\chi_{p_1}, \\dots, \\chi_{p_r})$ such that the LCM of their orders is exactly 6.\n    Let $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_i})$. The condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, \\dots, o_r)=6$ means that:\n    *   All orders $o_i$ must be divisors of 6.\n    *   At least one order $o_i$ must be divisible by 2.\n    *   At least one order $o_i$ must be divisible by 3.\n\n    Using inclusion-exclusion, the total number is:\n    (Total where lcm divides 6) - (Total where lcm divides 3) - (Total where lcm divides 2) + (Total where lcm divides 1)\n    Since the characters are non-trivial, their orders are greater than 1, so the last term is 0.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of unique prime factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.append(temp)\n    return factors\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef product(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the product of elements in a list.\n    \"\"\"\n    res = 1\n    for x in lst:\n        res *= x\n    return res\n\n# Given values for the problem\nd = 53599\ng = 6\n\n# Step 1: Find prime factors of the conductor d\nprime_factors = prime_factorize(d)\n\n# Step 2: Use inclusion-exclusion to find the number of characters.\n# The lcm of orders must be exactly 6.\n# This means the lcm must be divisible by 2 and 3.\n\n# Let N(k) be the number of tuples of non-trivial characters (c_p1, c_p2, ...)\n# such that lcm(ord(c_p1), ord(c_p2), ...) divides k.\n# N(k) = product over p of (gcd(k, p-1) - 1).\n\n# Calculate N(6): Total combinations where lcm(orders) divides 6\nn_div_6_list = [gcd(6, p - 1) - 1 for p in prime_factors]\nN6 = product(n_div_6_list)\n\n# Calculate N(3): Combinations where lcm(orders) divides 3 (lacks factor of 2)\nn_div_3_list = [gcd(3, p - 1) - 1 for p in prime_factors]\nN3 = product(n_div_3_list)\n\n# Calculate N(2): Combinations where lcm(orders) divides 2 (lacks factor of 3)\nn_div_2_list = [gcd(2, p - 1) - 1 for p in prime_factors]\nN2 = product(n_div_2_list)\n\n# The number of characters with order lcm being exactly 6 is N6 - N3 - N2\n# The intersection N(1) is 0 because characters are non-trivial (order > 1).\nresult = N6 - N3 - N2\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation with all numbers.\nprint(f\"The conductor is d = {d}, which has prime factors: {prime_factors}.\")\nprint(f\"The required order is g = {g}.\")\nprint(\"Let A be the number of primitive characters where the LCM of the orders of the component characters divides 6.\")\nprint(\"Let B be the number where the LCM of orders divides 3.\")\nprint(\"Let C be the number where the LCM of orders divides 2.\")\nprint(\"By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the desired number is N = A - B - C.\")\nprint(f\"A = {' * '.join(map(str, n_div_6_list))} = {N6}\")\nprint(f\"B = {' * '.join(map(str, n_div_3_list))} = {N3}\")\nprint(f\"C = {' * '.join(map(str, n_div_2_list))} = {N2}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe number of such characters is N = {N6} - {N3} - {N2} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<608>>>"
