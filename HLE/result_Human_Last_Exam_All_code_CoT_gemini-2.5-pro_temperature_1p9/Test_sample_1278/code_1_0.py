# Step 1: Define the variables from the problem.
num_pirates = 9
num_pairs = 16

# Step 2: The problem is modeled as finding the maximum number of cycles in a
# connected planar graph with V=9 vertices and E=16 edges.

# Step 3 & 4: Through analysis with Euler's formula, the graph structure that
# maximizes the number of cycles is the wheel graph W_9. This graph consists
# of a central vertex (pirate) and an outer cycle of n = V - 1 pirates.
n = num_pirates - 1

# Step 5: Calculate the number of cycles (standoffs) in the W_9 graph.
# The formula for the number of simple cycles in a wheel graph with a
# central vertex and an n-sided outer rim is n * (n - 1) + 1.

# These cycles are:
# - The one outer cycle of length n.
# - The cycles containing the central vertex. Every pair of vertices on the rim
#   defines two paths between them, and each path forms a cycle with the center.
#   This amounts to n*(n-1) cycles.
num_standoffs = n * (n - 1) + 1

# Step 6: Print the calculation and the final answer, showing each number.
