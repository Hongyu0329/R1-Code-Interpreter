    "This is a problem in abstract algebra, specifically in the theory of finite groups. To determine the finite filled nilpotent groups, we need to combine several established mathematical theorems. I will not be computing this from scratch but will follow a deductive path based on known results.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the derivation:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Definitions:** First, we need to understand the terms: \"finite nilpotent group,\" \"product-free set,\" \"maximum by inclusion product-free set,\" and \"filled group.\"\n2.  **Apply a Key Reduction Theorem:** A crucial theorem states that a finite group `G` is filled if and only if its Frattini quotient, `G/Φ(G)`, is filled. This simplifies the problem.\n3.  **Analyze the Quotient Group:** For a finite nilpotent group `G`, the quotient `G/Φ(G)` is abelian. This allows us to reframe the problem in the context of finite abelian groups.\n4.  **Use the Theorem for Abelian Filled Groups:** There is a specific characterization for when a finite abelian group is filled. An abelian group `A` is filled if and only if it has a subgroup of index 2 or 3.\n5.  **Connect Group Order to Subgroups:** A finite abelian group has a subgroup of prime index `p` if and only if its order is divisible by `p`.\n6.  **Relate the Order of G to its Quotient:** Finally, we use the property that a prime divides the order of `G` if and only if it divides the order of `G/Φ(G)`.\n7.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** By chaining these equivalences together, we can arrive at a simple characterization of finite filled nilpotent groups based on their order.\n\nFollowing this plan, I will now provide the Python code that prints the final answer and its justification.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and states the characterization of finite filled nilpotent groups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    title = \"Characterization of Finite Filled Nilpotent Groups\"\n    \n    # Step-by-step reasoning\n    reasoning = [\n        (\"1.
