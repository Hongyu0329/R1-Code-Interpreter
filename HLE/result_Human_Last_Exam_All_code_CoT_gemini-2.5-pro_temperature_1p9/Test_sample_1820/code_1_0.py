    """
    Calculates the theoretical completeness bound for an ontology mapping scenario.

    The problem describes mapping an ontology O1 (with mergeable siblings) to a 
    strict tree ontology O2. The theoretical completeness of such a mapping, M,
    is limited by the structural differences.

    Option D states that the completeness is bounded by ln(b)/d, where:
    - b is the branching factor of O1.
    - d is the depth of O1.
    - 'ln' is the natural logarithm.

    This formula is derived from information-theoretic principles, where ln(b) represents
    the structural information at each level, and the depth 'd' serves as a normalizing
    factor across the entire structure. The mergeable sibling property is the primary
_cause_
    for information loss, which this bound quantifies.
