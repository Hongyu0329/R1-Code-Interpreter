    Identifies the line numbers in triangle.py that contain programming errors.
    
    Errors are identified based on the following:
    1.  The file is a .py file, so Sage's pre-parser does not run. Standard Python syntax applies.
    2.  Use of '^' for exponentiation: In Python, '^' is XOR. This is an error on lines 11, 29, 30, and 31.
    3.  Integer division producing floats: In Python, '/' performs float division. The specification requires exact rationals. This is an error on lines 22 and 23.
