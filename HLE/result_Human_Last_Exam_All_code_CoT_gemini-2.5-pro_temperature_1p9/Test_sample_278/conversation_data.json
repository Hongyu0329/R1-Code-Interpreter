    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the x-coordinates:** The x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)` for `t` in `[0, 2π)`. The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, the minimum x-value (`x_min`) is -1 and the maximum x-value (`x_max`) is 1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the y-coordinates:** The y-coordinate is defined piecewise:\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, `y = 1 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 to 1. So, the y-values cover the range `[0, 1]`.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, `y = 5 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 down to -1 and back to 0. Thus, `5 * sin(t)` covers the range `[-5, 0]`.\n    *   Combining these two pieces, the total range for the y-coordinate is from -5 to 1. So, `y_min = -5` and `y_max = 1`.\n\n3.  **Determine the dimensions of the bounding box:**\n    *   The total width of the figure is `x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The total height of the figure is `y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square:** The smallest square that can outcircle the figure must have a side length equal to the larger of the width and height of the figure's bounding box.\n    *   Side length = `max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the area:** The area of this square is the side length squared.\n    *   Area = `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1. Define the ranges for x and y\n# For x = cos(t), t in [0, 2*pi), the range is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1.0\nx_max = 1.0\n\n# For y, we analyze two parts:\n# Part 1: t in [0, pi], y = 1 * sin(t). Range of sin(t) is [0, 1].\ny_max_1 = 1.0\ny_min_1 = 0.0\n\n# Part 2: t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5 * sin(t). Range of sin(t) is [-1, 0).\n# So range of 5*sin(t) is [-5, 0).\ny_max_2 = 0.0\ny_min_2 = -5.0\n\n# Overall y range is the union of the two parts.\ny_min = min(y_min_1, y_min_2)\ny_max = max(y_max_1, y_max_2)\n\n# 2. Calculate the width and height of the figure's bounding box.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# 3. Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\n# The side must be the maximum of the width and height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# 4. Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length ** 2\n\n# 5. Print the result.\n# The final equation is side * side = area. We print each number.\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is {int(side_length)}.\")\nprint(f\"The area is calculated as: {int(side_length)} * {int(side_length)} = {int(area)}\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
