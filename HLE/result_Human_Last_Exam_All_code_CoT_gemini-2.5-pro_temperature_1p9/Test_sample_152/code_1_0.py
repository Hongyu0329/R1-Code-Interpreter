# --- Step-by-Step Derivation of Cell 9 ---

# 1. Determine the Shape
# The pattern is three of each shape in order: Circle, Square, Triangle.
# Cells 1-3 are Circles.
# Cells 4-6 are Squares.
# Cells 7-8 are Triangles, so Cell 9 must complete the set.
shape_9 = "Triangle"

print("Step 1: Determine the Shape")
print("The sequence of shapes is three Circles, then three Squares, then three Triangles.")
print(f"Since Cell 8 is a Triangle, Cell 9 must also be a Triangle to complete the set of three.")
print(f"Shape of Cell 9: {shape_9}\n")

# 2. Determine the Number of Dots
# A pattern emerges within each group of three cells.
# For polygons (Square, Triangle), the dots follow a `0, d, 2*d` pattern.
# For the Triangle group:
# Cell 7 has 0 dots.
# Cell 8 has 3 dots. This establishes the common difference `d = 3`.
# Cell 9 will have `2 * d` dots.
dots_8 = 3
dots_9 = 2 * dots_8

print("Step 2: Determine the Number of Dots")
print("For polygon shapes (Square, Triangle), the number of dots in a group follows the pattern 0, d, 2*d.")
print(f"The second Triangle (Cell 8) has {dots_8} dots, which sets d = {dots_8}.")
print(f"The third Triangle (Cell 9) will therefore have 2 * d = 2 * {dots_8} = {dots_9} dots.")
print(f"Dots for Cell 9: {dots_9}\n")

# 3. Determine the Arrow Position & Final Equation
# There's a direct formula linking dots and the arrow's angle in radians:
# Angle = Dots * (π / 3)
angle_9_in_pi_multiple = dots_9 # The angle is 6 * (pi/3) = 2*pi. Let's just use the multiple.

print("Step 3: Determine the Arrow Position and Final Equation")
print("Across all given cells, the arrow's position is linked to the dot count by the formula: Angle_in_radians = Dots * (π / 3).")
print(f"For Cell 9, with {dots_9} dots, the angle is {dots_9} * (π / 3) = 2π radians.")
print("An angle of 2π is a full circle, which means the arrow is 'straight up'.")

print("\nThe final equation showing each number for Cell 9 is:")
# We represent pi as the text "pi" for clarity.
print(f"   {dots_9} = (2 * pi) / (pi / 3)\n")

# 4. Assemble the final text
# Following the formatting rules: an arrow in the 'straight up' position should be described as such.
arrow_text_9 = "Arrow is straight up"
final_answer = f"{shape_9}. {dots_9} dots. {arrow_text_9}"

print("--- Final Answer ---")
print("The exact text that corresponds to cell 9 is:")
print(final_answer)

# The final answer in the requested format
print(f"\n<<<{final_answer}>>>")
