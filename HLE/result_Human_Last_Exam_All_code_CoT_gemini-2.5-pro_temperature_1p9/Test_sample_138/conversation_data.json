    "To find the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2, we can use a fundamental result from the theory of integral quadratic forms.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the type of lattice:** The problem asks for \"even\" lattices. In the classification of integral lattices, these are also known as Type II lattices.\n2.  **Use the theory of local classification:** The properties of a lattice over the integers (a \"global\" object) are constrained by its properties over the p-adic integers for every prime p (its \"local\" properties). For a lattice to be even, its localization at `p=2` must be a Type II lattice over the 2-adic integers, Z₂.\n3.  **Apply the key theorem:** A fundamental theorem in the classification of quadratic forms over Z₂ states that a Type II Z₂-lattice can only exist in an **even** dimension. This is because all such lattices can be constructed from basic blocks of even dimension.\n4.  **Check the given dimension:** The problem specifies the dimension `n = 17`, which is an **odd** number.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the dimension is odd, a Type II Z₂-lattice of dimension 17 cannot exist. If the local lattice at p=2 cannot exist, then no corresponding global lattice over the integers can exist. Therefore, the number of such lattices is 0.\n\nThis reasoning allows us to solve the problem without needing to consider the determinant or performing complex calculations. The following Python code implements this logic.\n\n```python\ndef count_even_lattices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n    This function uses a fundamental theorem from the theory of integral quadratic forms\n    to determine the result without complex calculations.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The parameters of the problem\n    dimension = 17\n    determinant = 2\n    \n    print(f\"Finding the number of positive definite even lattices with dimension = {dimension} and determinant = {determinant}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the key mathematical constraint.\n    # An integral lattice is called \"even\" (or Type II) if the squared norm of every vector is an even integer.\n    # A fundamental theorem states that for an integer lattice to be even, its \"localization\" at the prime 2\n    # (i.e., the lattice considered over the 2-adic integers Z_2) must be a Type II Z_2-lattice.\n    print(\"1.
