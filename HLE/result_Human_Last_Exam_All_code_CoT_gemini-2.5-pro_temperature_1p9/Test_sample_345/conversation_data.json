    "This is a factual question that requires looking up information. I have found the answer and will present it using a Python script.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Store the key information (painting name, artist, years, and museum name) in variables.\n2.  Use an f-string to construct a sentence that answers the user's question.\n3.  Print the final sentence, which will include the numbers 1927 and 1967 as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_museum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the acquisition of the painting \"The Radionist\".\n    \"\"\"\n    painting_name = \"The Radionist\"\n    artist_name = \"Kurt Günther\"\n    creation_year = 1927\n    acquisition_year = 1967\n    museum_name = \"Lindenau-Museum Altenburg\"\n\n    print(f'The {creation_year} tempera painting \"{painting_name}\" by {artist_name} was acquired in {acquisition_year} by the {museum_name}.')\n\nfind_museum()\n```\n<<<Lindenau-Museum Altenburg>>>"
