    # execution of the endpoint, only protect one part of the system (e.g., the server),

    # This solution directly addresses the root cause. It aims to prevent
    # the adversary from placing implants in the first place by securing the
    # software supply chain and update process. By ensuring the integrity
    # of the software on all DNS components (clients and servers) through a
    # tamper-proof, verifiable ledger, it establishes a foundation of trust.
    # This is a preventative and universal strategy that best addresses the prompt's
    # constraints.
