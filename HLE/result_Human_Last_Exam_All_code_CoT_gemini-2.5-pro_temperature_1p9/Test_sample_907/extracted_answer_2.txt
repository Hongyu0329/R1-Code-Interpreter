    Case a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.

    In this case, the total absorption cross-section is the sum of the cross-sections of N identical, non-interacting molecules.
    The equation for the absorption cross-section, σ(ω), as a function of the laser's angular frequency ω is:

    Where:
      σ(ω)    : Absorption cross-section.
      N       : The total number (integer) of molecules in the chain.
      C       : A constant of proportionality that includes fundamental constants.
      ω       : The angular frequency of the incident laser pulse.
      |μ_fi|^2 : The squared magnitude of the transition dipole moment for a single molecule, between its initial state |i> (e.g., HOMO) and final state |f> (e.g., LUMO).
      E_i     : The energy of the initial state of the molecule (below the Fermi level).
      E_f     : The energy of the final state of the molecule (above the Fermi level).
      ħ       : The reduced Planck constant.
      τ       : The time duration of the Gaussian laser pulse. A shorter τ leads to a wider Gaussian spectral shape.
      exp(...) : The Gaussian lineshape function. This term shows that absorption is most efficient when the laser frequency ω matches the transition frequency (E_f - E_i)/ħ.

    Case b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered.

    Here, the interaction couples the molecules, and the excited states are delocalized "Frenkel excitons".
    Each exciton state is described by a quantum number k. The absorption cross-section is a sum over transitions to these allowed exciton states.

      Σ_{k=1 to N} : The sum over all exciton states, indexed by the integer quantum number k from 1 to N.
      μ_k        : The transition dipole moment from the collective ground state |G> to the k-th exciton state |Ψ_k>. Its value depends on the single-molecule dipole μ and k, and it leads to optical selection rules (e.g., for a simple chain, only transitions to k=1, 3, 5, ... are allowed).
      E_g        : The energy of the ground state of the entire chain.
      E_k        : The energy of the k-th exciton state. In a simple tight-binding model with near-neighbor coupling J, it is given by:
                 E_k = E_0 + 2*J*cos(π*k / (N+1))
                 Here, E_0 is the single-molecule excitation energy, J is the coupling energy, and π (pi) is the mathematical constant.
