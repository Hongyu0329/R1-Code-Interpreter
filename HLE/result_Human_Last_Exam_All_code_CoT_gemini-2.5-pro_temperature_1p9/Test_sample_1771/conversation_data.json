    "Of course. Here is the plan and the corresponding Python code to trace the etymology.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Start with the Proto-Germanic Form**: First, I will establish the reconstructed Proto-Germanic (PGmc) form of the verb. The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti` (a present tense formation from the root `*seh₂g-`) corresponds to the PGmc verb `*sōkijaną`, which means 'to seek'. I will use the 3rd person singular present tense form, `*sōkiþi`, to match the PIE ending `*-ti`.\n2.  **Apply Sound Changes for Each Daughter Language**: I will then simulate the specific, regular sound changes that transformed the Proto-Germanic word into its reflexes in Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n    *   **For Old Norse**, the key change is *i-umlaut*, where the `ō` in the root is fronted to `œ` due to the `i` in the following syllable, and the ending evolves to `-ir`.\n    *   **For Old English**, two changes happen to the root: *i-umlaut* changes `ō` to `ē`, and then *palatalization* turns the `k` into `ċ` (pronounced 'ch') before the new front vowel. The ending becomes `-eþ`.\n    *   **For Old High German**, the `ō` becomes the diphthong `uo`, and the *High German Consonant Shift* changes the root's `k` to the fricative `hh` and the ending's `þ` to `d`, which ultimately results in the ending `-it`.\n3.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will encapsulate this logic in a Python script. The script will define the starting PGmc form and then apply these transformations step-by-step, printing out the derivation for each language.\n\n```python\ndef trace_germanic_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the etymological development of a PIE verb into Germanic languages.\n    The script simulates major sound changes from a reconstructed Proto-Germanic form.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the Proto-Germanic form.\n    # The PIE verb *seh₂gieti ('(s)he gives a sign, tracks') gives rise to the\n    # Proto-Germanic (PGmc) weak verb *sōkijaną ('to seek').
