# Step 1: Define the given parameters for the X_0(t) problem.
A = 1e10
B = 1e-5 - 1
T = 1e20
alpha_1 = 0

# Step 2: Set up and solve the differential equation for X_0(t).
# The ODE is X_0'(t) = -(B + 1) * X_0(t) + A.
# Let's calculate the coefficient -(B + 1).
# B + 1 = (1e-5 - 1) + 1 = 1e-5.
# So, the ODE is X_0'(t) = -1e-5 * X_0(t) + 1e10.

# The general solution for an ODE of the form y' = -k*y + c is y(t) = C1*exp(-k*t) + c/k.
# In our case, k = B + 1 and c = A.
# So, the particular solution is X_p = A / (B + 1).
# The general solution is X_0(t) = C1 * exp(-(B+1)*t) + A / (B+1).

# Step 3: Apply the boundary condition to find the constant C1.
# The boundary condition is X_0(0) - X_0(T) = alpha_1.
# Let's express X_0(0) and X_0(T) using the general solution:
# X_0(0) = C1 * exp(0) + A / (B+1) = C1 + A / (B+1)
# X_0(T) = C1 * exp(-(B+1)*T) + A / (B+1)
#
# Substituting these into the boundary condition:
# (C1 + A / (B+1)) - (C1 * exp(-(B+1)*T) + A / (B+1)) = alpha_1
# This simplifies to: C1 * (1 - exp(-(B+1)*T)) = alpha_1.

# Now, we use the given values for alpha_1 and T.
# alpha_1 is 0, so the equation is: C1 * (1 - exp(-(B+1)*T)) = 0.
# The term exp(-(B+1)*T) = exp(-1e-5 * 1e20) = exp(-1e15).
# Since exp(-1e15) is an extremely small positive number, (1 - exp(-1e15)) is not zero.
# Therefore, for the product to be zero, the constant C1 must be 0.

# Step 4: Write the specific solution and evaluate it.
# With C1 = 0, the solution simplifies to X_0(t) = A / (B+1).
# This means that X_0(t) is a constant function.
# The value of X_0(t) at t = 10^20 is this constant value.

# Final Calculation
B_plus_1 = B + 1
