    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.** For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$, its simplicial volume is given by $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. This formula arises from the fact that for $g \\ge 2$, the surface admits a hyperbolic metric, and its simplicial volume is proportional to its Riemannian volume. For the torus ($g=1$), the formula gives 0, which is correct as its fundamental group is amenable.\n\n2.  **Recall the product formula for simplicial volume.** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, which both have non-zero simplicial volume (as is the case for hyperbolic manifolds like $\\Sigma_g$ with $g \\ge 2$), the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n    $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$.\n    Here, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$. Both are surfaces, so their dimension is 2. Thus, $m=2$ and $n=2$.\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas and calculate the result.**\n    *   First, we calculate the simplicial volume of each surface:\n        *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times (31 - 1)$\n        *   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times (17 - 1)$\n    *   Next, we calculate the binomial coefficient: $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2}$.\n    *   Finally, we multiply these three values together to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and print the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the genera and dimensions\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\nm = 2\nn = 2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume for each surface\n# The formula for the simplicial volume of a surface of genus g >= 1 is ||Σ_g|| = 4 * (g - 1).\nsv1 = 4 * (g1 - 1)\nsv2 = 4 * (g2 - 1)\n\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of a surface Σ_g of genus g >= 1 is given by the formula ||Σ_g|| = 4 * (g - 1).\")\nprint(f\"For the surface of genus {g1}:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * ({g1} - 1) = {sv1}\")\nprint(f\"For the surface of genus {g2}:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * ({g2} - 1) = {sv2}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient for the product formula\n# The product formula is ||M x N|| = C(m+n, m) * ||M|| * ||N||\n# Here m = n = 2 (dimension of a surface).\nbinom_coeff = math.comb(m + n, m)\n\nprint(f\"The product formula for simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = C({m+n}, {m}) * ||Σ_{g1}|| * ||Σ_{g2}||.\")\nprint(f\"The binomial coefficient C({m+n}, {m}) is {binom_coeff}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final simplicial volume\ntotal_sv = binom_coeff * sv1 * sv2\n\n# Step 5: Print the final equation with all values\nprint(\"The final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = {binom_coeff} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {total_sv}\")\n\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
