    "To solve this problem, we will find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A + BF` are at the desired locations, `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, we determine the desired characteristic polynomial from the given eigenvalues.\n2.  The system is a Multi-Input (MIMO) system because the input matrix `B` has two columns. For such systems, if they are controllable and the `B` matrix is square and invertible, we can use a method called direct substitution.\n3.  We will construct a target closed-loop matrix, `A_cl`, that has the desired eigenvalues. A convenient choice for `A_cl` is the controller companion form corresponding to the desired characteristic polynomial.\n4.  With the target `A_cl` matrix defined, the required feedback `F` must satisfy the equation `A + BF = A_cl`.\n5.  Since the matrix `B` is invertible, we can solve for `F` directly from this equation: `F = B⁻¹ * (A_cl - A)`.\n6.  The final script will perform these calculations using the `numpy` library and verify that the resulting `A + BF` has the correct eigenvalues.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_and_verify():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system A, B and\n    desired eigenvalues, then verifies the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the system matrices A, B\n    A = np.array([[-1.0, 1.0],\n                  [1.0, 0.0]])\n    B = np.array([[1.0, 2.0],\n                  [1.0, 0.0]])\n\n    # Step 2: Define the desired eigenvalues (poles) and find the characteristic polynomial\n    # Desired poles are p1 = -1 + j, p2 = -1 - j\n    # The characteristic polynomial is (s - p1)(s - p2) = (s - (-1 + 1j))(s - (-1 - 1j))\n    # = (s + 1 - 1j)(s + 1 + 1j) = (s + 1)^2 - (1j)^2 = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1) = s^2 + 2s + 2\n    # So, the coefficients are a1 = 2, a0 = 2.\n    a1 = 2.0\n    a0 = 2.0\n    \n    # Step 3: Construct a target closed-loop matrix A_cl in companion form.\n    # The companion form [[-a1, -a0], [1, 0]] has the characteristic polynomial s^2 + a1*s + a0.\n    A_cl = np.array([[-a1, -a0],\n                     [1.0, 0.0]])\n                     \n    # For verification, the other common companion form is [[0, 1], [-a0, -a1]].\n    # A_cl = np.array([[0.0, 1.0], [-a0, -a1]]) # This would also work.\n\n    # Step 4: Check if B is invertible and calculate its inverse\n    try:\n        B_inv = np.linalg.inv(B)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(\"Matrix B is not invertible.
