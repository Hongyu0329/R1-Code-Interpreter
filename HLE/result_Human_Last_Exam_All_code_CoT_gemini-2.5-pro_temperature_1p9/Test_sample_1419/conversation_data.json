    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to find the leading-order expression for the fixed-point coupling, denoted as $u^*$, in $\\phi^4$ theory. This is a well-known result from the Renormalization Group (RG) analysis, specifically using the Wilson-Fisher expansion in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Tool (The Beta Function):** The behavior of a coupling constant under a change of energy scale is described by its beta function, $\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the energy scale. Fixed points are the specific values of the coupling, $u^*$, where the theory becomes scale-invariant, which means the beta function is zero: $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n\n3.  **State the Beta Function:** For $\\phi^4$ theory with an interaction term $\\frac{u}{4!}\\phi^4$, the one-loop beta function in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions is:\n    $\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3 u^2}{16\\pi^2}$\n    *   The $-\\epsilon u$ term comes from the classical (engineering) dimension of the coupling constant $u$.\n    *   The $+\\frac{3 u^2}{16\\pi^2}$ term is the one-loop quantum correction.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Fixed Point:** To find the fixed point $u^*$, we need to solve the equation $\\beta(u^*) = 0$:\n    $-\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3 (u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0$\n    This equation has two solutions:\n    *   $u^* = 0$: This is the trivial \"Gaussian\" fixed point, which is unstable for $d<4$.\n    *   The non-trivial solution, known as the \"Wilson-Fisher\" fixed point, which governs the critical behavior of the system.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will use the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform these steps automatically.\n    *   Define the symbolic variables `u` and `epsilon`.\n    *   Create the expression for the beta function.\n    *   Solve the equation `beta(u) = 0` for `u`.\n    *   Identify the non-trivial solution from the results.\n    *   Print out the steps and the final expression, making sure to show how each numerical part contributes to the final equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u*\n    in phi^4 theory near four dimensions (d = 4 - epsilon).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
