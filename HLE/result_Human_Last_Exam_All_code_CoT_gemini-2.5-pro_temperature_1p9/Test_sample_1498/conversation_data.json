    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n1.  First, I will identify the specific lines (bayts) in the poem \"Aqeedat al-'Awaam\" that list the names of the Prophets.\n2.  The poem dedicates a specific section to enumerating the 25 prophets one must know. I will pinpoint the starting and ending bayt numbers for this list.\n3.  I will then create a Python script. This script will store these specific bayts and their corresponding numbers.\n4.  Finally, the script will print each bayt along with its number to clearly show the user the exact verses, and it will state the final range.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the task:\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the verses from 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The verses (bayts) from the poem are stored in a dictionary\n    # with their corresponding numbers.\n    prophet_verses = {\n        28: \"هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ ... صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n        29: \"لُوْطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ... يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\",\n        30: \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ... ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n        31: \"إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\"\n    }\n\n    start_bayt = min(prophet_verses.keys())\n    end_bayt = max(prophet_verses.keys())\n\n    print(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The specific verses are:\")\n    \n    for number, verse in prophet_verses.items():\n        print(f\"Bayt {number}: {verse}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final answer is that the names are listed from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<From bayt 28 to bayt 31>>>"
