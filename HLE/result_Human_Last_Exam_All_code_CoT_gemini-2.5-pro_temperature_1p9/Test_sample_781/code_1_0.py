    This problem can be reduced to a combinatorial question about sets.

    Let E be the set of 5 points. The condition on the continuum X implies that any proper subcontinuum can contain at most 2 points from E.
    The decomposition of X is given by X = A_1 U ... U A_n, where each A_i is a subcontinuum and has a part not covered by the others.
    As shown in the thinking process, this implies that each A_i must be a proper subcontinuum, so |A_i intersect E| <= 2.

    The argument proceeds to show that for any triplet of points T from E, the union of continua A_i that intersect T must be disconnected.
    This implies that for any triplet T, there must be at least one continuum A_k in the decomposition such that A_k is disjoint from T.

    Let S_k = A_k intersect E. The condition becomes:
    For every triplet T from E, there exists k such that S_k is disjoint from T.
    This is equivalent to saying: for every triplet T, there exists k such that S_k is a subset of E \ T.

    The set E \ T has size 5 - 3 = 2. So, for every triplet T, there must be a trace S_k that is a subset of the remaining pair of points.
    The set of all pairs of points from E is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all triplets from E. The number of such pairs (or triplets) is "5 choose 2" (or "5 choose 3").

    We want to find the largest possible n. The collection of traces {S_1, ..., S_n} must satisfy the condition that for any pair P from E, there is some S_k in the collection such that S_k is a subset of P.
    To maximize n, we can choose the collection of traces to be the set of all pairs of points from E. This collection has size "5 choose 2", and it satisfies the condition because for any pair P, P itself is in the collection.
    
    The number of points is 5. The condition relates to subsets of size 3.
    The argument suggests the answer is the number of pairs of points.
