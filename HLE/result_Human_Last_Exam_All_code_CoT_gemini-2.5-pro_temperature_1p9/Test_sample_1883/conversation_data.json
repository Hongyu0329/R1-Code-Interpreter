    "Of course, I can help you with this physical organic chemistry problem. Here is my plan to predict the product ratio:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory:** First, I'll determine the stereochemical course of the reaction (i.e., whether the ring closes in a conrotatory or disrotatory fashion). For a thermal reaction, we need to examine the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the pi system. \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene has 8 pi electrons, so its HOMO is ψ₄. The symmetry of the terminal orbitals in ψ₄ dictates the rotation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reactant Conformations:** The product ratio depends on the relative energies of the transition states leading to each isomer. According to the Curtin-Hammett principle, this can be approximated by the relative stabilities of the ground-state reactive conformers. The starting material must adopt an s-cis conformation along the chain to react. There are four such conformers, based on the 'inward' or 'outward' orientation of the terminal methyl groups.\n\n3.  **Determine Product from Each Conformer:** I will trace the stereochemical outcome for each of the four conformers undergoing a conrotatory ring closure. This will tell us which conformers lead to the *cis*-isomer A and which lead to the *trans*-isomer B.\n\n4.  **Estimate Conformer Stabilities:** The stability of each conformer is determined by steric strain. A methyl group oriented 'inward' will clash with a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon of the chain (a form of A¹,³ allylic strain). I will estimate the energy of these clashes to determine the relative energy of each of the four conformers. A standard value for this Me-H interaction is about 1.0 kcal/mol.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Product Ratio:** Using the Boltzmann distribution, the population of each conformer is proportional to `exp(-ΔE/RT)`. The final product ratio of A to B will be the ratio of the summed populations of conformers leading to A versus those leading to B. This will be calculated using Python.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef predict_product_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the product ratio of a thermal electrocyclic reaction\n    based on Frontier Molecular Orbital theory and conformer analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Theoretical Background (as explained in the plan)\n    # The reaction is an 8-pi electron thermal electrocyclization, which proceeds via\n    # a conrotatory mechanism according to FMO theory.\n    # The ratio of cis (A) and trans (B) products depends on the relative stabilities\n    # of the four possible reactive conformers of the starting material.\n    \n    # Step 3: Analysis of Conformers and Products\n    # Let 'in' and 'out' describe the orientation of the terminal methyl groups.\n    # Conrotatory motion applied to the four conformers gives:\n    # 1.
