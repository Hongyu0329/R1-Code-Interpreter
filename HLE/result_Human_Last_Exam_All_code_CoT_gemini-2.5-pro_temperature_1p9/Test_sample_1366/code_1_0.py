# This script calculates and presents the answers to the three parts of the question.

# Part (a): Analysis of the decomposition.
# Based on standard VOA theory, a VOA like V(p) (often referring to the triplet algebra W(p))
# does not have a natural structure as a module for sl_2 otimes L_k(sl_2) with commuting actions.
# The proposed decomposition form is therefore not applicable.
answer_a = "[No, No]"

# Part (b): Top-level dimension.
# L(p)_n is defined as the simple module for L_k(sl_2) whose top level is the
# sl_2-module rho_n. The dimension of rho_n is a well-known result from Lie theory.
# For any n >= 0, the dimension of the rho_n representation is n+1.
answer_b = "[n+1]"

# Part (c): Calculation of the minimal conformal weight for p = 2.
# This calculation proceeds assuming the decomposition given in (a) is valid for the purpose of the question.
# The minimal conformal weight in V(p) is the minimum of the minimal conformal weights
# of the modules L(p)_n over all n >= 0.

# Define the parameters for the calculation.
p = 2
n_for_min_weight = 0

# The level k is given by the formula.
k = -2.0 + 1.0/p

# The denominator in the conformal weight formula is k + g^v, where g^v=2 for sl_2.
k_plus_2 = k + 2.0

# The representation rho_n corresponds to sl_2 spin j = n/2.
j_for_min_weight = n_for_min_weight / 2.0

# The formula for the minimal conformal weight (h) of the highest-weight module with spin-j top level is h = j(j+1) / (k+2).
# We calculate h_n = (n/2 * (n/2+1)) / (k+2).
# For p=2, k+2 = 0.5, so h_n = n(n+2)/2. This is minimal for n>=0 at n=0.
numerator = j_for_min_weight * (j_for_min_weight + 1.0)
min_conformal_weight = numerator / k_plus_2
