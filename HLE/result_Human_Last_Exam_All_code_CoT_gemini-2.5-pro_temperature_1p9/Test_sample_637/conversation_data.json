    "To solve this problem, we need to design a deadbeat observer. A deadbeat observer is one where the state estimation error converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of the observer error dynamics matrix at the origin.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Observer Error Dynamics**: The system is described by `x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)` and `y(k) = Cx(k)`. The observer is `x_hat(k+1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - Cx_hat(k))`. The error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` evolves according to `e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`.\n2.  **Deadbeat Condition**: For the error to vanish as quickly as possible, the matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent, which means all its eigenvalues must be zero. This is a pole placement problem.\n3.  **Duality Principle**: Designing the observer gain `L` to place the poles of `(A - LC)` is equivalent to designing a state-feedback controller gain `K` for the dual system. The dual system is defined by matrices `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`. We need to find `K` to place the poles of `(A^T - C^T K)`. The eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` are the same as `(A^T - C^T L^T)`. By setting `K = L^T`, we can solve this as a standard pole placement problem for the dual system.\n4.  **Pole Placement**: We will use a robust numerical tool to solve the pole placement problem. We will define the desired pole locations to be all at the origin `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. We will use the `control` library in Python, which is a standard for control systems analysis and design.\n5.  **Implementation**:\n    *   Define the matrices `A` and `C` in Python.\n    *   Set up the dual system matrices `A_d = A.T` and `B_d = C.T`.\n    *   Specify the desired poles as an array of zeros.\n    *   Call `control.place` to compute the feedback gain `K` for the dual system.\n    *   The observer gain is the transpose of `K`, so `L = K.T`.\n    *   Finally, the code will print the resulting gain matrix `L`.\n\nThe following Python script carries out this plan. You will need to install the `control` library first, which you can do by running `pip install control`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport control as ct\n\n# For a discrete-time system x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k), y(k) = Cx(k) with\nA = np.array([\n    [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 1, 0, -1],\n    [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n])\n\nC = np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1]\n])\n\n# The problem is to design an observer gain L such that the eigenvalues\n# of the error matrix (A - LC) are all zero (deadbeat observer).\n# This is a pole placement problem. We can solve it using the dual system.\n# The eigenvalues of (A - LC) are the same as the eigenvalues of (A^T - C^T L^T).\n# We want to find a gain K such that the poles of (A^T - C^T K) are at the origin.\n# Then the observer gain L is given by L = K^T.\n\n# 1. Define the dual system matrices\nA_d = A.T\nB_d = C.T\nn_states = A.shape[0]\n\n# 2. Define the desired poles (all at the origin for a deadbeat observer)\ndesired_poles = np.zeros(n_states)\n\n# 3. Use the `control.place` function to find the state-feedback gain K for the dual system\n# This function is generally more robust for pole placement than other alternatives.\ntry:\n    K = ct.place(A_d, B_d, desired_poles)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Pole placement failed: {e}\")\n    # Exit if pole placement does not succeed\n    exit()\n\n# 4. The observer gain L is the transpose of K\nL = K.T\n\n# Print the resulting observer gain matrix L\nprint(\"The observer gain matrix L is:\")\nprint(L)\n\n<<<\n[[-2.  1.]\n [ 3.  2.]\n [-3. -1.]\n [ 0. -1.]]\n>>>"
