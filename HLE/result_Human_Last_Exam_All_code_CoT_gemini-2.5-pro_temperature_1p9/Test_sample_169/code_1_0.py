# --- Step 1: Analyze the relationship between latitude and biotic pressure ---
print("Step 1: Relate Latitude to Biotic Pressure")
print("It is a well-established ecological principle that biotic interactions (e.g., from parasites, herbivores) are strongest and most specialized in the tropics (low latitudes) and decrease towards the poles (high latitudes).")
print("Therefore, as latitude increases from the equator to 60°N, the co-evolutionary pressure from enemies on plants decreases.\n")


# --- Step 2: Determine the effect on α-diversity (within-plant diversity) ---
print("Step 2: Effect on Alpha (α) Diversity")
print("In a high-pressure tropical environment (low latitude), a single plant needs a complex cocktail of VOCs to defend against many specialized enemies. This leads to high α-diversity within each plant.")
print("In a low-pressure temperate environment (high latitude), a simpler, less costly chemical defense is sufficient. This leads to lower α-diversity.")
print("Conclusion: As latitude increases, α-diversity decreases. This is a NEGATIVE effect.\n")


# --- Step 3: Determine the effect on β-diversity (between-plant diversity at a site) ---
print("Step 3: Effect on Beta (β) Diversity")
print("In a high-pressure tropical environment (low latitude), there is a strong advantage for a plant to be chemically different from its neighbors. This prevents a specialized enemy that has adapted to one plant's defenses from spreading easily to the next. This selection for chemical uniqueness leads to high β-diversity.")
print("In a low-pressure temperate environment (high latitude), this pressure for differentiation is weaker. Plants may converge on similar chemical profiles optimized for shared abiotic stresses (like cold). This leads to lower β-diversity.")
print("Conclusion: As latitude increases, β-diversity decreases. This is a NEGATIVE effect.\n")


# --- Step 4: Final Conclusion ---
print("Step 4: Final Conclusion")
print("Both α-diversity and β-diversity of plant VOCs are expected to have a negative relationship with latitude.")
print("Direction of effect for α-diversity: negative")
print("Direction of effect for β-diversity: negative")
