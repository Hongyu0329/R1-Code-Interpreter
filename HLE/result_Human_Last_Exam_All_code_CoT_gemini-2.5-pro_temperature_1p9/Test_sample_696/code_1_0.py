# Final plan:
# The user wants to find a 32-character string to replace '@' in a Python one-liner.
# The one-liner is: from re import*;print(@r'\d+', input())})or ["NO"])
# The goal is to extract unique numbers from a string, sort them, and print them.
#
# My analysis leads to the conclusion that the one-liner is slightly flawed and will print
# a list representation (e.g., `[123, 456]`) instead of a space-separated string.
# Accepting this flaw, the core logic should be `sorted({int(n) for n in findall(r'\d+', input())})`.
# This expression produces a sorted list of unique integers.
#
# Let's see how this fits the template `@r'\d+', input())})`.
# The part of my expression before `r'\d+', input())` is `sorted({int(n) for n in findall(`.
# Let's count the characters in this specific string: "sorted({int(n) for n in findall(".
# 's','o','r','t','e','d','(','{','i','n','t','(','n',')',' ','f','o','r',' ','n',' ','i','n',' ','f','i','n','d','a','l','l','('
# This sequence has exactly 32 characters.
# The code that will be executed is:
# print(sorted({int(n) for n in findall(r'\d+', input())}) or ["NO"])
#
# Example 1 walkthrough:
# input: "hello 123 world 456 hello 123"
# findall(r'\d+', input()): ['123', '456', '123']
# {int(n) for n in ...}: {123, 456}
# sorted(...): [123, 456]
# [123, 456] or ["NO"]: [123, 456]
# print(...): outputs [123, 456]
#
# Example 2 walkthrough:
# input: "no numbers here"
# findall(r'\d+', input()): []
# {int(n) for n in ...}: {}
# sorted(...): []
# [] or ["NO"]: ["NO"]
# print(...): outputs ['NO']
#
# The logic works as intended for the one-liner's structure.

# The final code is just printing the string that replaces '@'.
