# Final check of the user request.
# "suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script" -> I should provide the final code in a block.
# "Don't include multiple code blocks in one response" -> OK
# "Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant."
# I should print the 32 characters. But the question is "Which 32 characters should be in place of @".
# Returning the string seems more direct. But following the instructions, I should use `print`.
#
# "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# This is a strange instruction. "output each number in the final equation!". It could mean to not just print the final answer,
# but print the reasoning. Or it could be a leftover instruction from a different kind of problem (like a math problem).
# Given the context "extract and sort unique numbers", I will interpret this as "print each number in the final sorted list".
# No wait, the prompt asks what the 32 chars are. The code I execute should output those 32 characters.
# The prompt is meta, my python code doesn't solve the number sorting problem, it solves the "find the 32 characters" problem.
# "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!" -> Maybe this means for the _user's code_.
# It is telling me that the final one-liner should print the numbers. So the user will copy the template, insert my string, and run it.
# E.g. user will run `from re import*;print(sorted({int(n) for n in findall(r'\d+', input())})or ["NO"])`
# My code block should just provide the 32 characters.
# I think printing the 32 character string is the right thing to do.

# Let me structure my final output.
# I'll provide the python block that prints the answer string.

# The other instruction "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!" might refer to something like `print('123 + 456 = 579')` instead of `print(579)`. It is not applicable here. I'll ignore it as likely noise from a previous task's instructions.
# I will simply print the 32 character string that fills `@`.

print('sorted({int(n) for n in findall(')

# And now wrap this in the response format.
