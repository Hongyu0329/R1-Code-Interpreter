# The solution is a sequence of commands, not a script to be executed.
# The logic has been explained above. The shortest sequence of commands to
# construct the inscribed square is LCCL.

# L: Draw a line through the given center O and point A to define a diameter, creating vertex C.
# C: Draw a circle from vertex A with a radius extending to vertex C.
# C: Draw a circle from vertex C with a radius extending to vertex A.
# L: Draw a line between the two new intersection points created by the previous two circles.
#    This line is the perpendicular bisector and defines the other two vertices (B and D)
#    where it crosses the original circle.

print("LCCL")
