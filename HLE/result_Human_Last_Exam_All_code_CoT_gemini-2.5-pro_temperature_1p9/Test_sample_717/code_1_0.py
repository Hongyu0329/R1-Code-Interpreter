# The problem asks for the value of an integer n based on a complex setup
# in the representation theory of posets and algebras.
#
# Let P be a poset, Vect_K denote the category of finite-dimensional K vector spaces,
# and I be a finite poset.
# Let f:I -> P be a functor that discretizes the tame functor F: P -> Vect_K
# such that f^k: Fun(I, Vect_K) -> Fun(P, Vect_K) is exact.
# F is n-resolvable for some n (possibly infinite). What is n?

# As reasoned in the steps above, the problem is a highly technical one whose
# answer stems from fundamental results in representation theory. The key concepts are:
# 1. "Tame" representation type.
# 2. "Discretization" which links the tame functor F to a category of finite
#    representation type (Fun(I, Vect_K)).
# 3. "n-resolvable", which implies a homological resolution of length n.
#
# The structural link between finite and tame representation types often involves
# homological phenomena of dimension 2. For instance, Auslander algebras associated with
# finite-type algebras have a global dimension of at most 2, and categories related
# to tame hereditary algebras are often 2-Calabi-Yau.
#
# Based on this deep connection, the most plausible answer for the length of the
# resolution, n, is 2. The complicated premises of the problem serve to establish
# the context in which this fundamental number of the theory applies.

n = 2

# The problem asks to output the final equation.
