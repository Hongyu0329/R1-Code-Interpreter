This question comes from a branch of mathematics called topology. To find the answer, we need to understand a key theorem.

1.  An **indecomposable continuum** is a special type of connected space that cannot be broken down into two smaller, proper connected subspaces that are also continua. A famous example is the pseudo-arc or the buckethandle continuum.

2.  A **composant** of an indecomposable continuum is a specific type of dense subset. The composants of an indecomposable continuum are mutually disjoint, and their union is the entire space.

A fundamental theorem of continuum theory states that **every indecomposable continuum has exactly 'c' composants**.

The symbol 'c' represents the **cardinality of the continuum**. This is the 'size' of the set of real numbers. It is an infinite number, specifically 2 to the power of ℵ₀ (aleph-naught, the cardinality of the natural numbers).

Since the number of composants is always 'c' for any indecomposable continuum, the smallest number it can have is also 'c'.
