    "This is a question from the field of point-set topology, specifically continuum theory. The answer is a known mathematical theorem, not a result of a computation. I will provide a Python script that explains the reasoning and prints the answer, as you requested.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to know the minimum number of \"composants\" in an \"indecomposable continuum\". They specify that the continuum is not necessarily metric and that \"composant\" is the intended term, not \"component\".\n2.  **Define the Terms:**\n    *   A **continuum** is a non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff space (in the more general sense) or a metric space (in the more common sense).\n    *   An **indecomposable continuum** is a continuum `X` that cannot be written as the union of two of its own proper subcontinua.\n    *   A **composant** of a point `p` in an indecomposable continuum `X` is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that `p` and `q` are contained in some proper subcontinuum of `X`.\n3.  **Recall Key Theorems:** A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that the composants of an indecomposable continuum `X` form a partition of `X`. Furthermore, it is a classic result that every indecomposable continuum (metric or not) has exactly **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., the size of the set of real numbers, 2^ℵ₀) distinct composants.\n4.  **Formulate the Answer:** Since *every* indecomposable continuum has **c** composants, the \"smallest number\" of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is also **c**. This is not a finite integer but a transfinite cardinal number.\n5.  **Create the Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this explanation. This satisfies the user's request for a code block and the use of the `print` function. The code will explain the concept and then state the final answer. The unusual request to \"output each number in the final equation\" is not applicable here, as the answer is a mathematical constant/concept (`c`), not the result of an equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef explain_composants_of_indecomposable_continuum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the answer to the topological question\n    about the number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThis question comes from a branch of mathematics called topology. To find the answer, we need to understand a key theorem.\n\n1.  An **indecomposable continuum** is a special type of connected space that cannot be broken down into two smaller, proper connected subspaces that are also continua. A famous example is the pseudo-arc or the buckethandle continuum.\n\n2.  A **composant** of an indecomposable continuum is a specific type of dense subset. The composants of an indecomposable continuum are mutually disjoint, and their union is the entire space.\n\nA fundamental theorem of continuum theory states that **every indecomposable continuum has exactly 'c' composants**.\n\nThe symbol 'c' represents the **cardinality of the continuum**. This is the 'size' of the set of real numbers. It is an infinite number, specifically 2 to the power of ℵ₀ (aleph-naught, the cardinality of the natural numbers).\n\nSince the number of composants is always 'c' for any indecomposable continuum, the smallest number it can have is also 'c'.\n\"\"\"\n\n    answer_value = \"c (the cardinality of the continuum)\"\n\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is: {answer_value}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the explanation and answer.\nexplain_composants_of_indecomposable_continuum()\n\n```\n<<<c>>>"
