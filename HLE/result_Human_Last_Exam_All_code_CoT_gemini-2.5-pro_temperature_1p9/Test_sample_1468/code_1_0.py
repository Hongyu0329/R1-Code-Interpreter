    # For each channel i in {1, ..., N/2}, we transmit a "message" from d' possible choices.
    # We encode the message c_i for channel i into the vector z_{i + N/2}.
    # Specifically, z_{i + N/2} = e_{c_i}, where e_k is the k-th standard basis vector in R^{d'}.

    # vector space V spanned by their differences {vec(X_c) - vec(X_c')}.
    # As reasoned in the thinking steps, the dimension of this space can be calculated.
