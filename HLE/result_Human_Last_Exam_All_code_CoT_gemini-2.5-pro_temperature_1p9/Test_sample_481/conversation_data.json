    "My plan is to identify the numerical imprints on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules. I will then write a Python script to compare these numbers.\n\n1.  First, I will store the numerical portion of the imprints for both the 10mg and 20mg capsules in string variables.\n2.  Next, the script will print out the full numerical imprint for each capsule strength, with each digit separated to fulfill the requirement of outputting each number.\n3.  Finally, I will use set operations to find the digits that are not shared between the two imprints and print these differing numbers.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_imprint_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the different numbers on Teva fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The full imprints are typically \"TEVA 3108\" and \"TEVA 3109\".\n    # We will focus on the numerical parts as requested.\n    imprint_10mg_num = \"3108\"\n    imprint_20mg_num = \"3109\"\n\n    # Print the individual numbers for each capsule's imprint\n    print(f\"The Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule has the numerical imprint: {' '.join(imprint_10mg_num)}\")\n    print(f\"The Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule has the numerical imprint: {' '.join(imprint_20mg_num)}\")\n\n    # Use sets to find the digits that are different\n    set_10mg = set(imprint_10mg_num)\n    set_20mg = set(imprint_20mg_num)\n\n    # The symmetric difference will give us the elements present in one set but not the other.\n    different_numbers = sorted(list(set_10mg.symmetric_difference(set_20mg)))\n\n    print(f\"\\nComparing the two numerical imprints, the numbers that are different are {different_numbers[0]} and {different_numbers[1]}.\")\n\nfind_imprint_differences()\n```\n<<<8 and 9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
