    Calculates the number of possible sequences based on the given constraints.

    The problem is to find the number of sequences of K positive integers
    a_1, ..., a_K such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_K <= N,
    and a_{i+1} - a_i <= M for all i.

    The given condition is M * (K - 1) < N.

    The number of such sequences can be found using a combinatorial formula derived
    from the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
    Sum_{j=0}^{K-1} (-1)^j * C(K-1, j) * C(N - j*M, K)
    where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient "n choose k".
