    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process followed by the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Model:** The problem asks for the number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables for a specific physical theory: the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered electronic systems.\n2.  **Symmetry Class and Parameters:** The system belongs to symmetry class D, which corresponds to Hamiltonians that are real and antisymmetric (`H = -H^T`). The model uses `n=2` replicas, a mathematical tool for handling disorder averages.\n3.  **Identify the Mathematical Space:** In this framework, the physical degrees of freedom (the Goldstone modes) are parameterized by a supermanifold. The number of bosonic variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of this supermanifold. For class D, this bosonic manifold is composed of two identical sectors, often denoted M_B (boson-boson or replica sector) and M_F (fermion-fermion or advanced-retarded sector).\n4.  **Determine the Manifold Structure:** For class D with `n` replicas, both M_B and M_F are given by the same symmetric space: the real Grassmannian manifold `O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))`.\n5.  **Calculate the Dimension:** The number of variables needed to parametrize this space is its mathematical dimension. The dimension of a coset space `G/K` is calculated as `dim(G) - dim(K)`. The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(m)` is given by the formula `m * (m-1) / 2`.\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   We set `n=2`.\n    *   The dimension of a single sector (e.g., M_B) is `dim(O(4)) - dim(O(2) x O(2))`.\n    *   `dim(O(4)) = 4 * (4-1) / 2 = 6`.\n    *   `dim(O(2)) = 2 * (2-1) / 2 = 1`.\n    *   `dim(O(2) x O(2)) = dim(O(2)) + dim(O(2)) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   The dimension of one sector is `6 - 2 = 4`.\n7.  **Find the Total:** The total number of bosonic variables is the sum of the dimensions of the two sectors, M_B and M_F. Since they are identical, the total is `4 + 4 = 8`.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model in class D with two replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
