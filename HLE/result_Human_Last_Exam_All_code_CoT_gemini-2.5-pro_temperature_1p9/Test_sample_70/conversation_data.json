    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish a method for calculating a flag's rank and then apply it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define a method for calculating flag rank:** A flag's visual design can be represented as a matrix where each distinct color is assigned a unique, independent numerical value. The problem states to assume values are chosen to maximize the rank; this means we must select color values that do not introduce artificial linear dependencies (e.g., we cannot set a color's value to 0 if it creates a zero-row where one isn't required by the geometry). The rank is the number of linearly independent rows in this matrix.\n2.  **Calculate the rank of the Danish flag:** The flag of Denmark is a red field with a white Nordic cross. A simplified matrix capturing its essential structure is:\n    ```\n    [Red,   White, Red  ]\n    [White, White, White]\n    [Red,   White, Red  ]\n    ```\n    Let the value for Red be `R` and White be `W`. To maximize the rank, we must choose `R` and `W` such that `R â‰  W` and neither is zero. Let's choose `R=1` and `W=2`. The matrix becomes:\n    ```\n    [1, 2, 1]\n    [2, 2, 2]\n    [1, 2, 1]\n    ```\n    The unique row vectors are `v1 = (1, 2, 1)` and `v2 = (2, 2, 2)`. These two vectors are linearly independent because `v1` is not a scalar multiple of `v2`. Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n3.  **Identify African flags with Rank 2:** We need to find African flags whose geometric structure also results in a rank of 2. A rank of 1 typically corresponds to simple designs with parallel stripes (like Germany) where all rows are scalar multiples of each other. A rank of 2 corresponds to a design that builds upon a rank-1 structure with a single additional feature that introduces a new, linearly independent row vector. This pattern (\"stripes + one emblem\" or \"field + one cross\") is what we will look for.\n4.  **List the qualifying flags:** Based on this analysis, several African flags fit the \"rank 2\" structure.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan by stating the rank of the Danish flag and then listing the African nations whose flags share this rank.\n\n```python\ndef solve_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and prints the list of African nations whose flags have the\n    same algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n    Methodology:\n    1. A flag's rank is determined by representing its design as a matrix of\n       numerical values, where different colors are assigned different non-zero numbers\n       to achieve the maximal possible rank.\n    2. The rank of this matrix is the number of its linearly independent rows.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the flag of Denmark\n    # Design: A red field with a white Nordic cross.\n    # We can model this with two distinct row types. Let Red=1 and White=2.\n    # One row type represents the white horizontal bar of the cross: [2, 2, 2]\n    # The other row type represents the red field interrupted by the vertical cross: [1, 2, 1]\n    # The equation for the rank is: Rank([[1, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2]])\n    # These two vectors are linearly independent.\n    denmark_rank = 2\n    \n    print(\"The linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is Rank([[1, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2]]) = 2, where the numbers represent two different colors.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Find African flags with a rank of 2.\n    # These flags typically feature a base of simple stripes (a rank-1 structure)\n    # modified by a single feature like an emblem, star, or contrasting stripe section,\n    # which introduces a second linearly independent row.\n    african_flags_rank_2 = [\n        \"Algeria\",      # Vertical bisection with a central emblem on the dividing line.\n        \"Angola\",       # Horizontal bisection with a central emblem.\n        \"Benin\",        # A vertical stripe at the hoist with two horizontal stripes at the fly.\n        \"Burkina Faso\", # Horizontal bisection with a central star.\n        \"Cape Verde\",   # Field with a horizontal stripe (and stars on it).\n        \"Ethiopia\",     # Horizontal tricolor with a central emblem.\n        \"Niger\",        # Horizontal tricolor with a central circle.\n        \"Rwanda\",       # Horizontal tricolor with a sun emblem in the corner.\n        \"Senegal\",      # Vertical tricolor with a central star.\n    ]\n\n    print(\"African nations with flags of the same rank (2) are:\")\n    for country in african_flags_rank_2:\n        print(country)\n\nsolve_flag_rank()\n\n```\n<<<Algeria\nAngola\nBenin\nBurkina Faso\nCape Verde\nEthiopia\nNiger\nRwanda\nSenegal>>>"
