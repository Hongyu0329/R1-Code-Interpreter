    Analyzes and prints the list of African nations whose flags have the

    Methodology:
    1. A flag's rank is determined by representing its design as a matrix of
       numerical values, where different colors are assigned different non-zero numbers
       to achieve the maximal possible rank.
    2. The rank of this matrix is the number of its linearly independent rows.

    # Design: A red field with a white Nordic cross.
    # We can model this with two distinct row types. Let Red=1 and White=2.
    # One row type represents the white horizontal bar of the cross: [2, 2, 2]
    # The other row type represents the red field interrupted by the vertical cross: [1, 2, 1]
    # The equation for the rank is: Rank([[1, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2]])

    # modified by a single feature like an emblem, star, or contrasting stripe section,
    # which introduces a second linearly independent row.
