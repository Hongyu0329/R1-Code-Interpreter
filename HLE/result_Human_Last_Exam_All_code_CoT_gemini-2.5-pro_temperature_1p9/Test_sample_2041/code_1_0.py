    Calculates the number of extensionally distinct functions induced by shallow expressions.

    The problem asks for the number of functions of type PPPX -> PX that can be
    represented by `λp. λx. e`, where `e` is a "shallow" expression of type Bool.

    1.  **Types**:
        - X: A base type.
        - Bool: The type of booleans.
        - PX: X -> Bool (a predicate on X)
        - PPX: PX -> Bool (a predicate on predicates of X)
        - PPPX: PPX -> Bool (a predicate on predicates on predicates of X)

    2.  **Shallow Expression 'e'**:
        An expression `e` is shallow if, during its execution, the function `p` is
        never applied to an argument that depends on `p`. The arguments to `p` must
        be of type PPX. Therefore, any argument `q` to `p` must be constructed
        from the only other available variable, `x:X`, and cannot have `p` as a
        free variable.

    3.  **Possible arguments `q` for `p`**:
        A term `q` of type PPX = (X -> Bool) -> Bool, constructed from `x:X`, takes
        a function `r: X -> Bool` and must return a `Bool`. In a parametric system,
        `q` cannot inspect the structure of `r`. It can only:
        - Ignore `r` and return a constant `true` or `false`.
        - Apply `r` to the only available argument of type `X`, which is `x`.

        This gives us four distinct (extensionally) possible `q` functions constructed from `x`:
        - q1 = λr. true
        - q2 = λr. false
        - q3 = λr. r(x)
        - q4 = λr. not(r(x))

        These four are the only building blocks for arguments to `p`.

    4.  **Forming the expression `e`**:
        The shallow expression `e` is built from `p` and `x`. It must be a boolean
        combination of the only available "atomic" boolean values that can be formed
        under the shallow condition. These are the results of applying `p` to the
        four `q` functions above.
        Let's name the results:
        - v1 = p(q1)
        - v2 = p(q2)
        - v3 = p(q3) = p(λr. r(x))
        - v4 = p(q4) = p(λr. not(r(x)))

        So, `e` can be any boolean function `f` of these four values: `e = f(v1, v2, v3, v4)`.

    5.  **Counting the functions**:
        Each distinct boolean function `f: Bool⁴ -> Bool` defines a distinct polymorphic
        function `λp. λx. e`.
        We need to count how many such functions `f` exist.
        The domain of `f` is a set of 4-tuples of booleans. The number of possible
        inputs to `f` is 2⁴.
        For each of these inputs, `f` can return one of two values (`true` or `false`).
        Therefore, the total number of distinct functions `f` is 2 raised to the
        power of the number of possible inputs.
