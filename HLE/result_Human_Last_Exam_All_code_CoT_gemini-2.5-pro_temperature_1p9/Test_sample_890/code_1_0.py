Thinking Process:
1.  The clinical case presents a 15-year-old male with a specific set of features.
2.  The most telling combination of symptoms is the presence of a cleft palate, characteristic facial features (midface hypoplasia, micrognathia), and significant developmental and speech delays.
3.  This combination is a classic presentation for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known by names such as Velocardiofacial syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a microdeletion on chromosome 22.
4.  Let's evaluate the options:
    - Chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21): Down syndrome has different characteristic facial features (e.g., flat facial profile, upslanting palpebral fissures).
    - Chromosome 13 (Trisomy 13): Patau syndrome is typically much more severe, and survival to age 15 is extremely rare.
    - Chromosomes 3 and 2: While abnormalities on these chromosomes can cause developmental issues, they are not associated with this particular classic combination of features as strongly as chromosome 22q11.2 deletion.
5.  Therefore, the constellation of findings in the patient strongly suggests an abnormality on Chromosome 22.
