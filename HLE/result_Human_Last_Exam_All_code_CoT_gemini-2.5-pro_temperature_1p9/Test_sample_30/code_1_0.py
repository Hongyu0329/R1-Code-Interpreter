# The user wants me to identify the correct statement about interactive proof systems.
# I have analyzed each statement and determined that statement D is the most accurate.
# Statement D reads: "If a prover and verifier are required, there are exponential requirements on the computational power of the prover, whereas the verifier is required to run in polynomial time"
# This captures the essential asymmetry of power in an interactive proof system. The verifier is efficient (polynomial-time), while the prover is powerful (unbounded, which includes exponential power).

# The user prompt requests a code block output. Since this is a multiple-choice question,
# I will print the letter corresponding to the correct answer.

correct_answer = 'D'
print(f"The correct statement is identified as option {correct_answer}.")
print("Analysis Summary:")
print("A: Incorrect. Interaction is the core concept.")
print("B: Incorrect. Graph Non-Isomorphism is a key example.")
print("C: Incorrect. Entanglement is a very powerful tool (MIP* = RE).")
print("D: Correct. This accurately describes the power asymmetry between a polynomial-time verifier and a powerful (super-polynomial) prover.")
print("E: Incorrect. Amplification makes the proof system robust to the exact parameters.")
print("F: Incorrect. Two provers are more powerful than one (MIP = NEXP > IP = PSPACE).")
print("G: Incorrect. Interactive proofs can solve PSPACE problems, which are harder than NP problems.")
print("H: Incorrect. The standard alphabet in complexity theory is binary {0, 1}.")
print("I: Incorrect. It misstates the soundness condition for NP.")
print("J: Incorrect/Obscure. Uses non-standard terminology and is less of a general truth than D.")
