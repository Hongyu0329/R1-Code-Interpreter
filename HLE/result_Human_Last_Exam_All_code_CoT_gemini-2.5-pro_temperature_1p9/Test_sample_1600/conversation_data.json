    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the formula:** The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams, `a(n)`, of order `2n` for electron or photon propagators in QED is given by the formula `a(n) = (2n - 1)!!`, where `!!` denotes the double factorial.\n2.  **Apply the value:** The user wants to find `a(3)`. I will substitute `n=3` into the formula. This gives `a(3) = (2*3 - 1)!! = 5!!`.\n3.  **Calculate the double factorial:** The double factorial `k!!` for an odd number `k` is the product of all odd integers from 1 up to `k`. So, `5!! = 5 * 3 * 1`.\n4.  **Write Python code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will first define `n=3`, then compute `a(3)`, and finally print the step-by-step calculation, including the full equation and the final result as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_feynman_diagrams(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n.\n    The formula is a(n) = (2n-1)!!, where !! is the double factorial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The value to calculate the double factorial for is k = 2n - 1\n    k = 2 * n - 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n is given by the formula a(n) = (2n-1)!!\")\n    print(f\"We want to find a(n) for n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"First, we calculate the term inside the double factorial: 2*n - 1 = 2*{n} - 1 = {k}\")\n    print(f\"So, we need to calculate a({n}) = {k}!!\")\n\n    # Calculate the double factorial (2n-1)!!\n    # The double factorial k!! for an odd k is the product of all odd integers from 1 to k.\n    result = 1\n    equation_terms = []\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n        equation_terms.append(str(i))\n    \n    equation_str = \" * \".join(equation_terms)\n    \n    print(f\"The double factorial {k}!! is the product of all odd integers from 1 up to {k}.\")\n    print(f\"So, the final equation is a({n}) = {equation_str} = {result}\")\n\n# The user is asking for a(3).\nn_value = 3\ncalculate_feynman_diagrams(n_value)\n```\n<<<15>>>"
