    "This is a problem in the field of mathematics known as continuum theory. I will outline the logic to arrive at the answer, and then present this reasoning within a Python script as requested.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Composants:** First, I'll clarify what a composant of a continuum is and the distinction between decomposable and indecomposable continua.\n2.  **Composants of a Product Space:** I'll use a key theorem from continuum theory that describes the number of composants in a product space `X x Y` based on the properties of `X` and `Y`.\n    *   **Theorem 1:** The product `X x Y` is decomposable if and only if at least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable. A decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant.\n    *   **Theorem 2:** If `X` and `Y` are both indecomposable, the number of composants of `X x Y` is the product of the number of composants of `X` and `Y`.\n3.  **Maximize the Number:** To find the largest possible number of composants for the product, we need to maximize the number of composants of the individual continua `X` and `Y`.\n4.  **Possible Number of Composants:** A continuum can be decomposable (1 composant) or indecomposable. While it was once thought that indecomposable continua must have uncountably many composants, it's now known that for any integer `n â‰¥ 2`, there exists an indecomposable continuum with exactly `n` composants. However, there also exist indecomposable continua (like the Knaster continuum or the pseudo-arc) that have **c** composants, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum (an uncountable infinity).\n5.  **Conclusion:** The maximum number of composants for a single continuum is **c**. Therefore, to maximize the number for the product, we choose two continua that each have **c** composants. The resulting number of a composant for their product is **c * c**, which, by the laws of cardinal arithmetic, is equal to **c**.\n\nThe following Python code explains this reasoning step-by-step and prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to find the largest possible number of \n    composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n    A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the largest possible number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua, X and Y, we analyze the cases based on their properties.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # --- Case 1: At least one continuum is decomposable ---\n    print(\"Case 1: At least one of the continua (X or Y) is decomposable.\")\n    print(\"A decomposable continuum has exactly 1 composant.\")\n    num_composants_decomposable = 1\n    print(f\"In this case, the product space X x Y is also decomposable, so it has {num_composants_decomposable} composant.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # --- Case 2: Both continua are indecomposable ---\n    print(\"Case 2: Both continua X and Y are indecomposable.\")\n    print(\"For an indecomposable continuum, the number of a composant can be a finite integer (>=2), countably infinite, or uncountably infinite ('c').\")\n    print(\"To find the largest possible number for the product, we must maximize the number of a composant for each factor continuum.\")\n    \n    # The maximum number of composants a single continuum can have is 'c'.\n    max_C_single = 'c' \n    print(f\"\\nThe maximum number of a composant for a single continuum is {max_C_single} (the cardinality of the continuum).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAccording to a theorem by Krakowski, if X and Y are indecomposable, the number of a composant of their product is the product of their respective numbers of composants: C(X x Y) = C(X) * C(Y).\")\n    \n    # We choose X and Y to be continua with the maximum number of composants.\n    num_C_X = max_C_single\n    num_C_Y = max_C_single\n    \n    print(\"\\nSo, we choose X and Y such that their number of a composant are maximized:\")\n    print(f\"Number of composants for X = {num_C_X}\")\n    print(f\"Number of composants for Y = {num_C_Y}\")\n    \n    # Using cardinal arithmetic, c * c = c\n    final_answer = 'c'\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the maximum number of a composant is:\")\n    # The 'numbers' in the equation are the symbols for the cardinalities.\n    print(f\"  {num_C_X} * {num_C_Y} = {final_answer}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThis result comes from cardinal arithmetic.
