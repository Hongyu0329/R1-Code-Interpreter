# Step 1: Define the constants for the approximate solution y(x) = A * x^alpha.
# From the analysis, we found alpha = -1.
alpha = -1.00

# From the analysis, A is the real cube root of -6.
A = -math.pow(6, 1/3)

# Step 2: Round the coefficient A to two decimal places as requested.
A_rounded = round(A, 2)

# Step 3: Print the analytical expression.
# The prompt requires printing the numbers in the final equation.
print("An approximate analytical expression for the solution in large x regimes is:")
print(f"y(x) = {A_rounded} * x**({alpha:.2f})")

# Step 4: Output the numbers in the final equation as requested.
print("\nThe numbers in this equation are:")
print(f"The coefficient A is: {A_rounded}")
print(f"The power alpha is: {alpha:.2f}")
