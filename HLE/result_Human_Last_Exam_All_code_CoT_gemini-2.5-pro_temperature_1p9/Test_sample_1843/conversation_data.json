    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $N$ and a specific order $K$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the structure of Dirichlet characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if it is not induced by a character with a smaller modulus. If $N$ has the prime factorization $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$, then any character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n2.  **Order of the character**: The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its primitive components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\ldots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$. We are given that the order should be $K=6$.\n\n3.  **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: The number of characters with order exactly $K$ can be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let $N(d)$ be the number of characters whose order divides $d$. The number of characters with order exactly $K$ is given by:\n    $$ \\sum_{d|K} \\mu(K/d) N(d) $$\n    where $\\mu$ is the MÃ¶bius function. $N(d)$ is the product of the number of choices for each primitive component $\\chi_i$ such that its order divides $d$.\n    Let $C(p^a, d)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose order divides $d$. Then $N(d) = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} C(p_i^{a_i}, d)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate $C(p^a, d)$**:\n    *   For a prime power $p^a$ with $p > 2$, the group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(p^a)$. A character is primitive if its order divides $\\phi(p^a)$ but not $\\phi(p^{a-1})$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$. So, $C(p^a, d)$ is the sum of $\\phi(k)$ for all $k$ that divide $d$ and are valid orders for primitive characters.\n    *   For $p=2$, the character group structure is special. For $N=36036=2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$, we only need to consider the case $p^a = 2^2=4$. There is only one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2.\n\n5.  **Putting it all together**:\n    *   Set $N=36036$ and $K=6$.\n    *   Find the prime factorization of $N$.\n    *   Find the divisors of $K=6$, which are $1, 2, 3, 6$.\n    *   For each divisor $d$, calculate $N(d) = \\prod C(p_i^{a_i}, d)$.\n    *   Calculate the final result using the inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef euler_phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    while d * d <= n:\n        while (n % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        factors[n] = factors.get(n, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef moebius_mu_recursive(n, factors):\n    \"\"\"Recursive helper for moebius_mu.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    p = list(factors.keys())[0]\n    m = factors[p]\n    if m > 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    remaining_factors = factors.copy()\n    del remaining_factors[p]\n    \n    rest_n = 1\n    for prime, power in remaining_factors.items():\n      rest_n *= prime**power\n      \n    return -moebius_mu_recursive(rest_n, remaining_factors)\n\ndef moebius_mu(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Moebius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n      return 0\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef count_prim_chars_order_divides_d(p, a, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of primitive characters modulo p^a whose order divides d.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Case p=2, a=1 (mod 2): No primitive characters.\n    if p == 2 and a == 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Case p=2, a=2 (mod 4): One primitive character of order 2.\n    if p == 2 and a == 2:\n        return 1 if d % 2 == 0 else 0\n        \n    # Case p=2, a>=3 (mod 2^a): Character group is Z_2 x Z_{2^{a-2}}.\n    # The number of primitive characters is 2^{a-2}.
