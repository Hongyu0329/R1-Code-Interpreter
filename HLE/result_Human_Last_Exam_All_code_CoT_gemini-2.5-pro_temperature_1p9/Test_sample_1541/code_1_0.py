How to Compile and Run
---------------------
1. Save the C code above into a file named `xenia_sum.c`.
2. Open a terminal and compile the code using a C compiler like GCC:
   gcc xenia_sum.c -o xenia_sum
3. Run the compiled program:
   ./xenia_sum
4. Type the input sum (e.g., 3+2+1+2+3) and press Enter. The program
   will print the sorted sum (e.g., 1+2+2+3+3)."""

--------------------
Memory Analysis (m)
--------------------
The total memory `m` used by the variables in this C program is calculated as follows. We assume a standard system where an `int` takes {sizeof_int_bytes} bytes.

- `int counts[4]`: Stores the frequency of four numbers.
  Memory: 4 * {sizeof_int_bytes} = {mem_counts} bytes

- `int c`: Stores the character read from input (as an int to hold EOF).
  Memory: {mem_c} bytes

- `int first`: A flag for printing logic.
  Memory: {mem_first} bytes

- `int i`: Loop counter for the outer loop.
  Memory: {mem_i} bytes
  
- `int j`: Loop counter for the inner loop.
  Memory: {mem_j} bytes

Total memory for variables (m) = {mem_counts} + {mem_c} + {mem_first} + {mem_i} + {mem_j} = {total_memory} bytes.
