  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters \"+\". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. String s is at most 1000 characters long.\n\nOutput\nPrint the new sum that Xenia can count.\n\nTask:\n\nWrite the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem. Answer m as the total memory in bytes used for variables of this problem. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "My plan to solve this problem is to first devise the most memory-efficient C program possible, and then calculate the memory usage of its variables as requested.\n\nThe most memory-efficient approach does not require storing the entire input string. Instead, it can read the input one character at a time. While reading, it can count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'. This is a form of counting sort. After counting is complete, the program can construct and print the sorted sum directly based on the counts. This method avoids allocating a large buffer for the input string, using only a few variables for counts and control flow.\n\nThe following Python script encapsulates this solution. It will print the C code, explain how to use it, and provide a detailed calculation of its memory usage (`m`).\n\n```python\ndef present_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the solution by printing:\n    1.
