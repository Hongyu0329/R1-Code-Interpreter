    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  I will first identify the core question, which is to name the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who distinguished between \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" as components of a \"hallmark\".\n2.  This is a knowledge-based query. To fulfill the request of providing a code-based solution, I will create a Python script that simulates a search through a small knowledge base.\n3.  The knowledge base will be represented as a Python dictionary, where keys are the names of philosophers from the Lviv-Warsaw School, and values are strings describing their key concepts.\n4.  The script will iterate through this dictionary, searching for the entry that contains all the keywords from the user's question: \"hallmark,\" \"symptoms,\" and \"signals.\"\n5.  Once the correct philosopher is found, the script will print their name as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a search through a knowledge base to find the Lviv-Warsaw School\n    philosopher associated with the concepts of hallmark, symptoms, and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A small, simulated knowledge base of Lviv-Warsaw School philosophers and their ideas.\n    philosophers_knowledge_base = {\n        \"Kazimierz Twardowski\": \"Founder of the school. Famous for his work on the content and object of presentation. He decomposes the notion of a hallmark (cecha) into its components: symptoms and signals.\",\n        \"Stanisław Leśniewski\": \"Known for his work on mereology, ontology, and protothetic. A radical nominalist.\",\n        \"Jan Łukasiewicz\": \"A logician and philosopher famous for his work on many-valued logic and his parenthesis-free Polish notation.\",\n        \"Alfred Tarski\": \"A logician and mathematician known for his work on model theory, metamathematics, and algebraic logic, as well as his semantic theory of truth.\"\n    }\n\n    # Keywords to search for.\n    search_keywords = [\"hallmark\", \"symptoms\", \"signals\"]\n\n    # Iterate through the knowledge base to find the matching philosopher.\n    found_philosopher = \"No philosopher found matching the criteria.\"\n    for philosopher, description in philosophers_knowledge_base.items():\n        # Check if all keywords are present in the philosopher's description.\n        if all(keyword in description.lower() for keyword in search_keywords):\n            found_philosopher = philosopher\n            break\n\n    # Print the result.\n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of a hallmark into symptoms and signals is: {found_philosopher}\")\n\nfind_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Twardowski>>>"
