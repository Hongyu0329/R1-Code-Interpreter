    # Step 3: Analyze the legal/contractual requirements for repossession.
    # The contract requires "written notice of default".
    # Under Ontario's Consumer Protection Act (CPA), which applies to this type of transaction,
    # a simple text is generally not sufficient. A notice of default must be formal and contain
    # specific information, such as the amount required to cure the default, a deadline, and a
    # clear statement of the lender's intentions.

    print("2. Gary sent a text message on February 2, 2023, stating that Jack 'missed a payment'.")
    print("3. A simple text message like this does not typically meet the legal standard for a 'written notice of default', which must be formal and contain specific details about the default and how to cure it, as often required by consumer protection legislation.")
    print("4. Since Gary did not provide a proper written notice of default, the three-day cure period specified in the contract never officially began.")
    print("5. Therefore, Gary's attempt to repossess the vehicle on February 6, 2023, was premature because he had not yet fulfilled his own obligations under the contract's default procedure.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices.
    # Choice C accurately reflects this conclusion. Gary is not yet entitled to repossess the vehicle
    # because his text message does not constitute a proper "written notice of default".

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Gary is not yet entitled to retake possession of the vehicle. While Jack did miss a payment, Gary failed to follow the contract's required procedure by not providing a legally sufficient 'written notice of default'.")
