    "Here is my plan to solve the task.\n1.  First, I need to identify the main allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Next, I will identify the distinct color of each of these allotropes.\n3.  Then, I will count the number of distinct colors.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that prints out the name and color of each allotrope, constructs an equation by summing them up, and prints the final result.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of distinct colors\n    observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary mapping the allotrope name to its characteristic color\n    allotropes = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"white\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"black\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The main allotropes of phosphorus and their colors are:\")\n    for allotrope, color in allotropes.items():\n        print(f\"- {allotrope}: {color}\")\n\n    count = len(allotropes)\n    \n    # Building the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in allotropes]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of colors, we can set up the following equation:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
