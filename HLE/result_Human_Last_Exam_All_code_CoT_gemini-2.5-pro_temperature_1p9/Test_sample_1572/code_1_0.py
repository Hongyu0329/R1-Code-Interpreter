    # The asymptotic expansion of ln(Q(n)) can be derived using the Euler-Maclaurin formula.

    # The given approximation T(n) corresponds to the main terms of this expansion.
    # The error ln(Q(n)) - ln(T(n)) is a series in powers of 1/n.

    # Using the Euler-Maclaurin formula, the error terms are found to be:
    # ln(Q(n)/T(n)) = C1/n^2 + C2/n^4 + C3/n^6 + ...
