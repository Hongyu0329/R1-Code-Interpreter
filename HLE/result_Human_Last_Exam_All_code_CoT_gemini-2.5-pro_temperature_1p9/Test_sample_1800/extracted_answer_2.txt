The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single fixed value; research indicates an optimal range for the atomic ratio Ni/(Ni+Ce) is typically between 0.05 and 0.15. This low nickel concentration maximizes the dispersion of Ni particles and the active interface with ceria, which is crucial for high catalytic performance in both WGS and water splitting reactions.
