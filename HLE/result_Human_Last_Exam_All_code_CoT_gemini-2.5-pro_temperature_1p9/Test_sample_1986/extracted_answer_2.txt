    This function calculates the coefficients k_Yuk and k_D+F by matching terms
    between the N=4 SYM Lagrangian and an N=1 SYM + 3 WZ multiplets Lagrangian.

    Plan:
    1.  Determine k_Yuk by matching the gaugino-scalar-fermion interaction terms.
        - The N=4 Yukawa term contains 2 * phi_{i4} * lambda^i * lambda^4.
        - Using the decomposition phi_{i4} = 1/2 * (varphi + varphi*), this gives a term k_Yuk * f_abc * varphi_i^{*a} * psi^{biA} * lambda_A^c.
        - The N=1 Lagrangian provides the term sqrt(2) * f_abc * varphi_i^{*a} * psi^{biA} * lambda_A^c.
        - Comparing coefficients gives k_Yuk = sqrt(2).

    2.  Determine k_D+F by matching the scalar potential terms.
        - The scalar potential of N=4 SYM, when decomposed into N=1 language, splits into a D-term potential and an F-term potential: V_N=4 = V_D + V_F.
        - The corresponding Lagrangian terms are L_{F+D} = L_D + L_F.
        - The problem provides the N=1 D-term part as L_D = 1/2 * (f_{abc} * varphi_i^{*b} * varphi^{ic})^2.
        - The supersymmetry of the N=4 theory fixes the relative coefficients of all terms in the Lagrangian. The coefficient of the F-term potential becomes equal to
