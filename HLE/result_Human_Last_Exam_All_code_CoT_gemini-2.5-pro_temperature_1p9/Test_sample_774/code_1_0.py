    # Part 1: The Sum
    # The term l(n,p) is the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold M(n,p).
    # With the standard Euclidean metric, this radius is pi for n > p. The prime
    # indices given ensure n > p and n,p >= 5.
    # The double summation runs from i=1 to 10 and j=1 to 10, resulting in 100 terms.
    # Each term l(n,p) is equal to pi.

    # Part 2: The Integral
    # The integral can be broken down into two parts.
    # The first part depends on dimensions d1 and d2. The indices for the primes
    # used to calculate d1 and d2 are very large (p_781, p_8231, etc.).
    # This leads to enormous values for d1 and d2.
    # In the limit as d -> infinity, the first part of the integral evaluates to 0.
    # The very large values of d1 and d2 suggest that this limit is the intended
    # method of evaluation.

    # The second part of the integral is of the function x * exp(-x) from 0 to infinity.
    # This is the definition of the Gamma function Gamma(2), which equals 1.

    integral_val = integral_part1 + integral_part2
