# This script calculates the maximum achievable ratio as derived from the physics of the problem.
# The final expression for the ratio is R = pi * (16 - 7*sqrt(2)) / 3.

# Define the components of the equation
# Coefficient from the integration
coeff_1 = 16.0
# Coefficient of the square root of 2
coeff_2 = 7.0
# The number under the square root
num_sqrt = 2.0
# The divisor
divisor = 3.0

# Calculate the value
sqrt_val = math.sqrt(num_sqrt)
numerator = math.pi * (coeff_1 - coeff_2 * sqrt_val)
result = numerator / divisor

# Print the equation and the result
print(f"The final expression for the ratio is: pi * ({int(coeff_1)} - {int(coeff_2)}*sqrt({int(num_sqrt)})) / {int(divisor)}")
print(f"The calculated maximum ratio is: {result}")
