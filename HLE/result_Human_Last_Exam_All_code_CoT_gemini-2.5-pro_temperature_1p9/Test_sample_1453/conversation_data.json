    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we need to analyze its potential to form a coiled-coil structure. The stability and oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil are primarily determined by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of amino acid side chains at the core of the helical bundle.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Heptad Repeat Analysis**: Coiled-coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeating pattern, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The core positions, `a` and `d`, are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. The surface positions, `e` and `g`, are often polar or charged and can form stabilizing interhelical salt bridges.\n2.  **Register Identification**: A sequence can be \"read\" in seven different frames, or registers, depending on which residue is assigned to the `a` position. The most stable register is the one that places the most hydrophobic residues at the core (`a` and `d`) and the most polar residues at the surface (`e` and `g`).\n3.  **Scoring Registers**: We will write a Python script to iterate through all seven possible registers. For each register, it will calculate a score. This score will be based on maximizing the hydrophobicity of the core positions (`a`, `d`) while minimizing the hydrophobicity of the surface positions (`e`, `g`). We will use a standard hydrophobicity scale for this calculation.\n4.  **Oligomer Prediction**: Once the optimal register is found, we will examine the specific pattern of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions. Specific patterns are known to favor different oligomeric states due to packing efficiency:\n    *   **Dimer (2)**: Often has large hydrophobic residues (like L, I) at both `a` and `d`.\n    *   **Trimer (3)**: A common pattern is a small residue (like Alanine) at `a` and a large one (like Leucine) at `d`, or `a=I`, `d=L`.\n    *   **Tetramer (4)**: A classic pattern is a large residue at `a` and a small one at `d` (`a=L, d=A`) or the highly specific `a=L, d=I` pattern.\n5.  **Conclusion**: The script will identify the best register, report the residues at the key positions, apply the packing rules to predict the oligomeric state, and print the final number.\n\nThe following Python code implements this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# 1.
