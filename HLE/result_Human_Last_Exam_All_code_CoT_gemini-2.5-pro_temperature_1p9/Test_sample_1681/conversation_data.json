    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, we'll follow the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  **Framework Setup**: The game starts with a quantum state `|00>` (representing both players cooperating). This state is then entangled using a unitary operator `J`. The degree of entanglement is a key parameter of the game. We will choose a maximally entangling operator, which is optimal for resolving the classical dilemma.\n\n2.  **Player Strategies**: Players' strategies are no longer simple 'Cooperate' or 'Defect' but are unitary operators they apply to their respective qubit. The classical strategies C and D are special cases, but a continuous range of quantum strategies is available. A strategy `U(θ)` can be parameterized by `θ` where `θ=0` is Cooperate (C) and `θ=π` is Defect (D).\n\n3.  **Final State & Payoff**: After the players apply their strategies `U_A` and `U_B`, a disentangling operator `J†` (the inverse of `J`) is applied. The resulting final quantum state is measured in the classical basis (`|00>`, `|01>`, `|10>`, `|11>`). The probabilities of these outcomes determine the players' expected payoffs according to the given payoff matrix.\n\n4.  **Finding the Equilibrium**: A Nash Equilibrium is a pair of strategies `(U_A*, U_B*)` where neither player can get a better payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. For the given payoff matrix and maximal entanglement, a new equilibrium appears that is Pareto-superior to the classical (Defect, Defect) outcome. This new equilibrium strategy is `Q = U(π/2)`, often called the \"miracle\" move. The symmetric strategy profile `(Q, Q)` constitutes a Nash Equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: We will write a Python script using `numpy` to implement this model. The script will:\n    *   Define the payoff matrix.\n    *   Define the quantum operators `J` and `U(θ)`.\n    *   Set the strategies to the equilibrium strategies `U_A = Q` and `U_B = Q`.\n    *   Calculate the final state by applying the operators: `|ψ_final> = J†(U_A ⊗ U_B)J|00>`.\n    *   Determine the probabilities of the four classical outcomes.\n    *   Calculate the final equilibrium payoff for each player and display the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff matrix [ [(A_CC, B_CC), (A_CD, B_CD)], [(A_DC, B_DC), (A_DD, B_DD)] ]\n    payoff_A = np.array([[5, 0], [7, 1]])\n    payoff_B = np.array([[5, 7], [0, 1]])\n\n    # Define standard matrices and quantum states\n    I = np.identity(2, dtype=complex)\n    sigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n    sigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]], dtype=complex)\n\n    ket_0 = np.array([[1], [0]], dtype=complex)\n    ket_1 = np.array([[0], [1]], dtype=complex)\n    ket_00 = np.kron(ket_0, ket_0) # Represents (Cooperate, Cooperate) initial state\n\n    # Step 1: Define the entangling operator J\n    # J = exp(i * gamma/2 * (sigma_x ⊗ sigma_x))\n    # We choose an optimal scenario with maximum entanglement, gamma = pi/2.\n    gamma = np.pi / 2\n    J = np.cos(gamma / 2) * np.kron(I, I) + 1j * np.sin(gamma / 2) * np.kron(sigma_x, sigma_x)\n    J_dagger = J.conj().T\n\n    # Step 2: Define player strategies U(theta)\n    # U(theta) = exp(i * theta/2 * sigma_y)\n    def U(theta):\n        return np.cos(theta / 2) * I + 1j * np.sin(theta / 2) * sigma_y\n\n    # The new Nash Equilibrium in the quantum game is the strategy theta = pi/2 (\"Q\")\n    # C (Cooperate) is U(0) and D (Defect) is U(pi).\n    theta_A = np.pi / 2 # Player A chooses strategy Q\n    theta_B = np.pi / 2 # Player B chooses strategy Q\n\n    U_A = U(theta_A)\n    U_B = U(theta_B)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the final state\n    # psi_final = J_dagger * (U_A ⊗ U_B) * J * |00>\n    U_kron = np.kron(U_A, U_B)\n    psi_final = J_dagger @ U_kron @ J @ ket_00\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the probabilities of each outcome\n    # P_ij = |<ij|psi_final>|^2\n    prob_00 = np.abs(np.kron(ket_0, ket_0).conj().T @ psi_final)**2\n    prob_01 = np.abs(np.kron(ket_0, ket_1).conj().T @ psi_final)**2\n    prob_10 = np.abs(np.kron(ket_1, ket_0).conj().T @ psi_final)**2\n    prob_11 = np.abs(np.kron(ket_1, ket_1).conj().T @ psi_final)**2\n\n    P_CC = prob_00[0,0]\n    P_CD = prob_01[0,0]\n    P_DC = prob_10[0,0]\n    P_DD = prob_11[0,0]\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the expected payoffs\n    PA_CC, PA_CD, PA_DC, PA_DD = payoff_A.flatten()\n    PB_CC, PB_CD, PB_DC, PB_DD = payoff_B.flatten()\n    \n    payoff_A_eq = PA_CC * P_CC + PA_CD * P_CD + PA_DC * P_DC + PA_DD * P_DD\n    payoff_B_eq = PB_CC * P_CC + PB_CD * P_CD + PB_DC * P_DC + PB_DD * P_DD\n\n    print(\"At the (Q, Q) equilibrium:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Probabilities (CC, CD, DC, DD): ({P_CC:.3f}, {P_CD:.3f}, {P_DC:.3f}, {P_DD:.3f})\")\n    print(\"\\nPayoff Calculation for Player A:\")\n    print(f\"E_A = ({PA_CC} * {P_CC:.3f}) + ({PA_CD} * {P_CD:.3f}) + ({PA_DC} * {P_DC:.3f}) + ({PA_DD} * {P_DD:.3f})\")\n    print(f\"E_A = {payoff_A_eq:.3f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nPayoff Calculation for Player B:\")\n    print(f\"E_B = ({PB_CC} * {P_CC:.3f}) + ({PB_CD} * {P_CD:.3f}) + ({PB_DC} * {P_DC:.3f}) + ({PB_DD} * {P_DD:.3f})\")\n    print(f\"E_B = {payoff_B_eq:.3f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe equilibrium point payoff is ({:.1f}, {:.1f}).\".format(payoff_A_eq, payoff_B_eq))\n\n\nrun_quantum_prisoners_dilemma()\n```\n<<<3.5>>>"
