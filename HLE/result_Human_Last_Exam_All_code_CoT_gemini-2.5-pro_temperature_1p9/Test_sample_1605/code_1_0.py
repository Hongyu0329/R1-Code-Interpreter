# The reasoning outlined above reduces the problem to finding a known value
# in enumerative graph theory. The problem asks for the number of
# homeomorphism classes of compact metric spaces with a disconnection number
# of four. By interpreting this in the context of finite, connected graphs,
# we deduce the following:
#
# Let G be a connected graph with n vertices.
# The disconnection number d(G) is 4. This means:
# 1. There is a set of 3 vertices whose removal leaves the graph connected.
# 2. Any set of 4 vertices disconnects the graph.
#
# From condition 2, we deduce that n must be 5.
# If n > 5, say n=6, removing any 4 vertices leaves 2. For the graph
# to be disconnected, there must be no edge between these 2 vertices.
# Since this must hold for ANY choice of 4 vertices to remove, it implies
# the graph has no edges, which contradicts it being connected.
# If n = 5, removing any 4 vertices leaves 1 vertex, which is a disconnected
# graph. So condition 2 holds for any 5-vertex graph.
#
# From condition 1, for a 5-vertex graph, removing 3 vertices leaves 2. For these
# 2 vertices to form a connected graph, there must be an edge between them.
# This means the graph must contain at least one edge.
#
# A connected graph on 5 vertices must contain at least one edge.
# Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic
# connected graphs on 5 vertices.
#
# This value is well-known in combinatorics.
