    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The curve given by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)` is a specific type of curve known as a Lissajous curve.\n2.  **Find the relevant formula:** There is a well-known formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points for Lissajous curves. For a curve of the form `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, where `a` and `b` are integers, the number of self-intersections `N` can be calculated.\n3.  **Check the conditions:** The formula `N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2` applies when `a` and `b` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1) and they are not both even.\n4.  **Apply the formula to the specific problem:**\n    *   From the given equations, we have `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n    *   Check the conditions: The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are coprime. Both 9 and 5 are odd numbers, so the condition is met.\n    *   Substitute `a = 9` and `b = 5` into the formula to find the number of self-intersection points.\n5.  **Create the Python script:** I will write a Python script that defines the values of `a` and `b`, applies the formula, and prints out each step of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_curve_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve\n    defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The curve is defined by (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n    # The parameters are a = 9 and b = 5.\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections for a Lissajous curve\n    # with coprime integer parameters a and b is N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2.\n    # First, we check if a and b are coprime.\n    def gcd(p, q):\n        while q:\n            p, q = q, p % q\n        return p\n\n    if gcd(a, b) != 1:\n        print(f\"The formula may not apply as a={a} and b={b} are not coprime.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the number of self-intersections.\n    # The formula is N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2\n    part1 = a - 1\n    part2 = b - 1\n    numerator = part1 * part2\n    num_intersections = numerator / 2\n\n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation of the final equation.\n    print(f\"For the curve (cos({a}t), sin({b}t)), the number of self-intersections is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values a = {} and b = {}:\".format(a, b))\n    print(\"N = ({} - 1) * ({} - 1) / 2\".format(a, b))\n    print(\"N = {} * {} / 2\".format(part1, part2))\n    print(\"N = {} / 2\".format(numerator))\n    print(\"N = {}\".format(int(num_intersections)))\n\nsolve_curve_intersections()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
