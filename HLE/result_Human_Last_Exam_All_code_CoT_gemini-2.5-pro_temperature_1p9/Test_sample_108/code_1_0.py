# Define the segment lengths and clearance
l1 = 40  # cm, Shoulder to Elbow
l2 = 28  # cm, Elbow to Wrist
l3 = 15  # cm, Wrist to Hand
l4 = 10  # cm, Hand to Finger
clearance = 3.5  # cm

# Step 1: Interpret the constraints to find the separation distance and bend radius.
# "3.5 cm clearance on either side" implies a total separation of 2 * 3.5 cm.
separation_distance = 2 * clearance
# The bend at each joint is a semi-circle with a diameter equal to the separation distance.
bend_radius = separation_distance / 2

# Step 2: Calculate the effective lengths of the straight parts of the segments.
# L1 and L4 are bent at one end, L2 and L3 are bent at both ends.
l1_eff = l1 - bend_radius
l2_eff = l2 - 2 * bend_radius
l3_eff = l3 - 2 * bend_radius
l4_eff = l4 - bend_radius

# Step 3: Calculate the final coordinates for the optimal folding configuration.
# The optimal configuration is for all segments to fold back (in the negative x-direction)
# to bring the fingertip as close as possible to the shoulder.
# Let's trace the x and y coordinates.
# Initial position is the shoulder at (0,0).
# L1 extends along the positive x-axis.
x_pos = l1_eff
y_pos = 0

# Elbow joint: Fold back.
x_pos -= l2_eff
y_pos += separation_distance

# Wrist joint: Fold back.
x_pos -= l3_eff
y_pos += separation_distance

# Hand joint: Fold back.
x_pos -= l4_eff
y_pos += separation_distance

final_x = x_pos
final_y = y_pos

# Step 4: Calculate the final distance.
distance = math.sqrt(final_x**2 + final_y**2)

# Print out the thinking process and the final equation
