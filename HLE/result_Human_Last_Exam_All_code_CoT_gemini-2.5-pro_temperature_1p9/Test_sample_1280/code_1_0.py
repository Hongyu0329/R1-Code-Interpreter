    This function explains the solution to the theoretical problem posed.

    The problem asks for the maximum number of differing energy levels between two
    supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians, H_0 and H_1.

    Let S0 be the set of eigenvalues (the spectrum) for H0, and S1 for H1.
    The theory of supersymmetry shows that for any eigenvalue E in S0,
    there is a corresponding eigenvalue E in S1, unless the eigenstate
    is annihilated by the operator L.

    This annihilation can only happen at a specific energy level, E = -alpha.
    The same logic applies in reverse from H1 to H0.

    This means the two spectra S0 and S1 are identical, except for a possible
    difference at the single energy value E = -alpha.

    So, one spectrum might contain the eigenvalue -alpha while the other does not.
    They cannot differ at any other energy value.

    Therefore, the maximum number of levels by which the spectra can differ is 1.
