# The question explores a theoretical limit of cryptography.
# The security of an encryption system is fundamentally based on the secrecy of the key.
# All standard and quantum cryptographic methods rely on this principle.

# Let's represent the core function of encryption:
# Ciphertext = Encrypt(Plaintext, Key)
# Plaintext = Decrypt(Ciphertext, Key)

# The premise is: The adversary knows the 'Key'.
# If the adversary has the Ciphertext (which is transmitted publicly) and the Key,
# they can compute the Plaintext just like the intended recipient.
# Therefore, the confidentiality of the system is broken.

# Analyzing the options:
# A, B, C, D, E all describe methods that are powerful but still rely on a secret key.
# If that key is compromised, as stated in the problem, security is lost.

# The correct conclusion is that maintaining security under such conditions is impossible.
# This corresponds to option F.

answer = "F"
