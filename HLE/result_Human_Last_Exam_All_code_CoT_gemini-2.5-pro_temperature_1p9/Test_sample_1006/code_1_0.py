def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function solves the topology problem about homeomorphism classes.
    
    The problem describes a compact topological space X with two properties:
    1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.

    These two properties are the defining universal properties of the Stone-Čech
    compactification of R, denoted as beta(R). The long ray R is a Tychonoff space,
    so its Stone-Čech compactification exists and is unique up to homeomorphism.

    Let's analyze this:
    - Any space X satisfying the given properties must be homeomorphic to beta(R).
    - If X1 and X2 are two such spaces, then X1 is homeomorphic to beta(R) and
      X2 is homeomorphic to beta(R).
    - Since homeomorphism is an equivalence relation, X1 must be homeomorphic to X2.

    This means all spaces satisfying the conditions belong to a single homeomorphism class.
    Therefore, the number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
