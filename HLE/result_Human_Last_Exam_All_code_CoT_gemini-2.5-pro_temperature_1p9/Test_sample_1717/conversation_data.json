    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I need to find the official formula for how boss health scales with the number of players in Terraria's Expert Mode. I will reference the official Terraria Wiki, which is a reliable source for game mechanics derived from the source code.\n\nThe formula is as follows:\n`Total Health = BaseHealth * (1 + LifeBonusPerPlayer * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n\nNext, I will find the specific values for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode:\n1.  **BaseHealth**: The starting health of the boss in single-player Expert Mode.\n2.  **LifeBonusPerPlayer**: The percentage increase in health for each additional player. In Expert Mode, this is 35% or 0.35.\n\nWith the formula and the specific values, I can set up a mathematical expression where the number of players `N` approaches infinity. This becomes a limit problem.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library, which is designed for symbolic mathematics. This script will:\n1.  Define the number of players `N` as a symbol.\n2.  Construct the health equation using the known base health and scaling factor.\n3.  Calculate the limit of this equation as `N` approaches infinity.\n4.  Print out each component of the calculation and the final theoretical maximum health.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_eoc_max_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode\n    with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the Terraria Wiki, which documents information from the game's source code:\n    # 1. The base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is 3640.\n    # 2. In Expert Mode, boss health increases by 35% (0.35) for each player beyond the first.\n\n    base_health = 3640\n    life_bonus_per_player = 0.35\n\n    # We define the number of players as a mathematical symbol 'N'.\n    N = sympy.Symbol('N')\n\n    # The formula for health scaling in multiplayer Expert Mode is:\n    # Health = BaseHealth * (1 + LifeBonusPerPlayer * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\n    health_equation = base_health * (1 + life_bonus_per_player * (N - 1))\n\n    # To find the theoretical maximum with infinite players, we calculate the limit\n    # of the health equation as N approaches infinity (oo).\n    theoretical_max_health = sympy.limit(health_equation, N, sympy.oo)\n\n    # Let's simplify the equation to see the linear relationship.\n    # H = 3640 * (1 + 0.35*N - 0.35)\n    # H = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35*N)\n    # H = (3640 * 0.65) + (3640 * 0.35) * N\n    # H = 2366 + 1274 * N\n    constant_part = base_health * (1 - life_bonus_per_player)\n    scaling_part = base_health * life_bonus_per_player\n\n    print(\"Terraria Boss Health Calculation: Eye of Cthulhu (Expert Mode)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Base Health: {base_health}\")\n    print(f\"Life Bonus Per Additional Player: {life_bonus_per_player}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe general formula is: H = BaseHealth * (1 + Bonus * (N-1))\")\n    print(\"\\nSimplified linear equation:\")\n    print(f\"H = {int(constant_part)} + {int(scaling_part)} * N\")\n    print(\"\\nAs the number of players (N) approaches infinity, the total health also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe theoretical maximum health is: {theoretical_max_health}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_eoc_max_health()\n\n```\n<<<infinity>>>"
