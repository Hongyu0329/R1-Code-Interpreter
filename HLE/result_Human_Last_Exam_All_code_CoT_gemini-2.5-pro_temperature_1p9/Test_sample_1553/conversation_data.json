To answer it while adhering to the request for a code-based solution, I will write a simple Python script. The script's purpose will be to store the name of the character in a variable and then print it as the answer to your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_character_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the character that the protagonist of\n    Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The main character is Adam Zamoyski.\n    # The character he marries is named Angelika.\n    character_name = \"Angelika\"\n    \n    print(f\"The name of the character that the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość' marries is: {character_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_character_name()\n```\n<<<Angelika>>>"
