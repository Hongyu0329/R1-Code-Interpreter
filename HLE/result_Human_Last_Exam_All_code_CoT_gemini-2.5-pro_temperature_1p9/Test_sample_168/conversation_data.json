    "To determine which animal can hear human muscle twitches, we first need to know the frequency of sound produced by muscle contractions. The sounds from muscle activity, known as mechanomyography, are very low-frequency, typically in the range of 5 Hz to 30 Hz.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that does the following:\n1.  Stores the approximate hearing range for each animal listed in the options.\n2.  Defines the target frequency range for human muscle twitches.\n3.  Iterates through each animal and compares its hearing range to the muscle twitch frequency range.\n4.  Prints the analysis for each animal, explicitly showing the frequency numbers being compared.\n5.  Identifies the animal with the hearing capabilities best suited for detecting these specific low-frequency sounds.\n\nThe code will check which animal's hearing range includes the 5-30 Hz frequency of muscle twitches to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_animal_hearing_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal from a given list can hear human muscle twitches\n    by comparing hearing ranges.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Store the approximate hearing ranges (in Hertz) for each animal.\n    # Sources for these ranges are based on general scientific consensus.\n    animal_hearing_ranges = {\n        'A.

Whale': (7, 35000),  # Representative for infrasonic Baleen whales.\n        'E.
