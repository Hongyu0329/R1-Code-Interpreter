The approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is to provide a signal to natural predators (e.g., birds), whose visual systems are fundamentally different from humans (e.g., they can see ultraviolet light). Using human observers and standard photographs fails to measure similarity from the perspective of the ecologically relevant receiver of the signal, rendering the findings unreliable for understanding functional mimicry syndromes.
