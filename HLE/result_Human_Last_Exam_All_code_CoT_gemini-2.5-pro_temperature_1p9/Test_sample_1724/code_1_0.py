# The task is to find the 3rd term of the nonlinear correction to the frequency
# using the Poincare-Lindstedt method.
# The frequency omega is expanded in powers of epsilon:
# omega = omega_0 + epsilon*omega_1 + epsilon^2*omega_2 + epsilon^3*omega_3 + ...
# The nonlinear correction to the frequency is the series starting from omega_1:
# Delta_omega = epsilon*omega_1 + epsilon^2*omega_2 + epsilon^3*omega_3 + ...
#
# Term 1 of correction = epsilon * omega_1
# Term 2 of correction = epsilon^2 * omega_2
# Term 3 of correction = epsilon^3 * omega_3
#
# The natural frequency of an oscillator must be independent of the sign of the
# initial displacement. This means that the frequency, omega, must be an even
# function of the perturbation parameter, epsilon.
# omega(epsilon) = omega(-epsilon)
#
# A power series for an even function can only contain even powers of its variable.
# Therefore, all coefficients of odd powers of epsilon in the series for omega must be zero.
# This means: omega_1 = 0, omega_3 = 0, omega_5 = 0, ...
#
# The question asks for the 3rd term of the nonlinear correction, which is epsilon^3 * omega_3.
# Since omega_3 is 0, the value of this term is 0.
