  Calculates the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero.

  This problem comes from a deep area of mathematics known as algebraic K-theory.
  The structure of the K-groups for rings like Z/p^k is known from advanced theorems.
  The condition for the (2n)th K-group to be nonzero is conjectured to be related to a
  structural invariant of the ring Z/p^k where p=3 and k=3.
  This invariant is given by the formula (p^k - 1) / (p - 1). The largest integer n
  for which the group is non-zero is believed to be this value.
