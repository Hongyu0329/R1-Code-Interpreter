  print("This analysis identifies the two key reasons behind the author's phrasing in the poem.")
  print("\nReason 1: The Literal Action of the Sea")
  print("The phrase 'measures and re-measures' describes a continuous, rhythmic action. In the physical world, this most directly corresponds to the movement of the tides. The sea level rises and falls, constantly changing the boundary with the land. This is the 'flow of tides'.")
  print("\nReason 2: The Figurative Meaning and Mood")
  print("The poem has a very introspective and solitary mood, set 'At the grave edge of the world' with the speaker feeling like 'agate, opaline'. The sea's constant, repetitive action acts as a mirror for a contemplative state of mindâ€”the way a person might turn a thought or a feeling over and over. This 'evoke[s] ideas of introspective contemplation'.")
  print("\nConclusion:")
  print("Therefore, the phrase serves two functions: to describe the physical movement of the tides and to create a mood of deep, internal contemplation. Answer choice A captures both of these functions.")
