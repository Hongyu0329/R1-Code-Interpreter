    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the matrix Euclidean algorithm. This method involves forming a composite matrix by stacking P1 on top of P2, and then reducing this matrix to a simpler form using elementary row operations. The goal is to obtain a matrix of the form `[D; 0]`, where D is the GCRD.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Form the Augmented Matrix**: Create a 4x2 matrix `M` by stacking `P1` and `P2`.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n2.  **Apply Elementary Row Operations**: Systematically apply a series of allowed row operations to simplify the matrix `M`. The operations include:\n    *   Swapping any two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero polynomial.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Reduce to Echelon Form**: The objective is to transform `M` into an upper triangular form (specifically, a row-echelon form) where the bottom rows become zero.\n4.  **Extract the GCRD**: The remaining non-zero block at the top of the reduced matrix will be a GCRD of the original matrices `P1` and `P2`.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic computations and finds the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two\n    polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, using the Euclidean algorithm based on\n    elementary row operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s], [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    print(\"The given polynomial matrices are:\")\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Form the augmented matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"Applying the Euclidean algorithm by performing row reduction on the composite matrix M = [P1; P2].\")\n\n    # Step 2: Apply a sequence of elementary row operations to reduce M.\n    \n    # Operations to zero out the first column below a certain pivot\n    # R1 -> R1 - (s+1)*R3 and R2 -> R2 + s*R3\n    M[0, :] = M[0, :] - (s + 1) * M[2, :]\n    M[1, :] = M[1, :] + s * M[2, :]\n\n    # Swap R1, R2 and make the leading element 1\n    M.row_swap(0, 1)\n    M[0, :] = -M[0, :]\n\n    # Use the new R1 to eliminate other elements in the first column\n    # R3 -> R3 - s*R1 and R4 -> R4 + (s+1)*R1\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] - s * M[0, :]\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] + (s + 1) * M[0, :]\n    M[3, 1] = sympy.simplify(M[3, 1])\n\n    # Operations to zero out the second column below a certain pivot\n    # This part is analogous to the polynomial Euclidean algorithm\n    # R3 -> R3 + s^2*R2 and R4 -> R4 - (s^2+s)*R2\n    q, _ = sympy.div(sympy.poly(M[3, 1], s), sympy.poly(M[1, 1], s), domain='EX')\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + (s**2) * M[1, :]\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] - q * M[1, :]\n\n    # Final cleanup to get to row-echelon form\n    M.row_swap(1, 3) # bring the row [0, 1] to the pivot position\n    M[0, :] = M[0, :] + (s**2) * M[1, :] # R1 -> R1 + s^2*R2\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] + s * M[1, :] # R4 -> R4 + s*R2\n\n    # Step 3: Extract the GCRD from the non-zero rows of the reduced matrix\n    GCRD = M[:2, :]\n\n    print(\"\\nAfter reduction, the greatest common right divisor D(s) is:\")\n    print(\"D(s) = [[{}, {}],\".format(GCRD[0,0], GCRD[0,1]))\n    print(\"        [{}, {}]]\".format(GCRD[1,0], GCRD[1,1]))\n\nfind_gcrd()\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
