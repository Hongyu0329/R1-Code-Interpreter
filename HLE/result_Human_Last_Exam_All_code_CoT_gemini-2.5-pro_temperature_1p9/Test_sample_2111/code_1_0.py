    # Fernand Braudel was a historian who focused on large, long-term structures.
    # His primary unit of historical analysis was not the nation-state, but a larger,
    # more enduring entity with its own sphere of influence, economy, and culture.
    # While Braudel quoted Morand's idea of the nation (France) being in a "hexagon,"
    # he used it as a starting point to discuss his own much broader concept.
    # The "conceptual entity" that encompasses nations and operates within a global
    # "sphere" in Braudel's work is 'Civilization'.
