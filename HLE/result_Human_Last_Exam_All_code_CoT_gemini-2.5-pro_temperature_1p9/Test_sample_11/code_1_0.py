    This function identifies and prints the first Israeli statute that explicitly
    introduced the concept of "good faith".
    
    The history of Israeli civil law codification in the late 1960s and early 1970s
    saw the introduction of the "good faith" principle, a significant departure
    from the earlier English common law tradition.
    
    - The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973 is famous for making "good faith" a foundational principle.
    - However, earlier laws from this period also contained the concept.
    - The Sale Law, 1968 explicitly requires performance in good faith in its section 6.
    - The Gift Law, 1968, passed on June 19, 1968, also explicitly requires performance
      in good faith in its section 3. It was enacted several months before the Sale Law.
      
    Therefore, the Gift Law is considered the first statute to introduce the concept.
