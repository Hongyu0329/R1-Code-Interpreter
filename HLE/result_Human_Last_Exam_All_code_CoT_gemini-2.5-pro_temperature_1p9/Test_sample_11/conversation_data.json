    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will research the history of civil legislation in the modern State of Israel to identify the introduction of the legal principle of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, *tom lev*). While this principle is famously associated with the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973, which made it a general, overriding duty, I will search for its explicit inclusion in earlier statutes passed by the Knesset. I will specifically investigate the series of civil laws enacted in the late 1960s, comparing their enactment dates to find the very first one that contains the term \"good faith\". Finally, I will provide the name of that statute according to your formatting requirements.\n\nThe python script below will print the name of the statute.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_statute_with_good_faith():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the first Israeli statute that explicitly\n    introduced the concept of \"good faith\".\n    \n    The history of Israeli civil law codification in the late 1960s and early 1970s\n    saw the introduction of the \"good faith\" principle, a significant departure\n    from the earlier English common law tradition.\n    \n    - The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973 is famous for making \"good faith\" a foundational principle.\n    - However, earlier laws from this period also contained the concept.\n    - The Sale Law, 1968 explicitly requires performance in good faith in its section 6.\n    - The Gift Law, 1968, passed on June 19, 1968, also explicitly requires performance\n      in good faith in its section 3. It was enacted several months before the Sale Law.\n      \n    Therefore, the Gift Law is considered the first statute to introduce the concept.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    statute_name = \"Gift Law\"\n    print(statute_name)\n\nfind_first_statute_with_good_faith()\n```\n<<<Gift Law>>>"
