def solve_datalog_statement_count():
    """
    Analyzes five statements about a set of definitions related to Datalog programs
    and counts how many of them are correct.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:

    Statement A: Correct. The definition of segregation relies on "order of appearance"
    to create the ordered multiset C_P. For a Datalog program, which is mathematically
    a set of clauses, this order is not well-defined, making the segregation process
    ambiguous or ill-defined.

    Statement B: Incorrect. The statement claims that gamma[segregate(P)] = P might not hold.
    However, by the definitions, segregation replaces constants (e.g., 'c') with constants
    from their pre-image (e.g., 'c_prime'). The aggregation operator gamma is defined such
    that it maps every 'c_prime' back to 'c'. Therefore, applying aggregation after
    segregation will precisely reverse the substitutions, restoring the original program P.
    The property holds.

    Statement C: Correct. This statement concerns the reverse composition: segregate[gamma(P)].
    Aggregation (gamma) is a many-to-one mapping and thus loses information. For example, if a
    program P_orig contained the constant 'Calvin' and gamma('Calvin') = 'Hobbes', then
    gamma(P_orig) would contain 'Hobbes'. Applying segregation to this new program would
    replace 'Hobbes' with its other pre-images (like 'Calvin'), but not necessarily restore
    the original P_orig, especially if P_orig contained 'Hobbes' to begin with. Thus,
    segregate[gamma(P)] is not necessarily equal to P.

    Statement D: Incorrect. This statement claims ambiguity in the segregation process,
    suggesting it might only use a "single representative". The recursive definition of
    segregation involves a union over all possible substitutions from the pre-image set
    (excluding the original constant). This leads to a combinatorial expansion, generating
    many new facts/rules, not a single one. The criticism points to a false ambiguity.

    Statement E: Correct. This provides a clear, high-level interpretation of the main claim.
    The claim gamma[deduce(segregate(P), segregate(S0))] = deduce(P, S0) indeed asserts that
    if P and S0 are at a stable "coarse" granularity, the result of the coarse-grained
    inference is identical to the coarsened result of the fine-grained inference. This implies
    that, under these conditions, no essential information is lost by working at the
    coarse-grained level.
