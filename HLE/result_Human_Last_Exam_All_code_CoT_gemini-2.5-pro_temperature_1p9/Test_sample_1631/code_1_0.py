    explanation = """
    The scientific basis for adding negative and positive bypass notches in sheet metal forming is primarily to manage the flow of material during the drawing process. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:

    1.  **Core Problem:** When sheet metal is stamped into a die with complex geometries (like sharp corners, small radii, or tight contours), the material does not flow evenly from the flat blank into the three-dimensional die cavity.

    2.  **Material Flow Issues:** In these complex areas, the material can "lock up" or get stuck. This forces adjacent areas to stretch excessively to fill the die, leading to thinning and potential tearing. Conversely, if material is restricted from flowing into one area, it may be forced to "pile up" in another, causing compressive stresses that result in wrinkles.

    3.  **The Solution - Bypass Notches:** A bypass notch is a strategically placed cut or indentation in the flange or addendum of the part. It acts as a controlled channel or "shortcut." This channel allows material to flow more freely around the difficult geometry instead of being forced over or through it. By "bypassing" the problematic area, the overall flow of material into the die becomes more uniform.

    4.  **Evaluating the Best Choice:** Option (D) perfectly encapsulates this concept. It correctly identifies the problem as "issues of material inflow into forming cavities around complex geometries" and cites relevant examples like "small radii." The other options describe either consequences of poor material flow (like thinning or wrinkling) or different, unrelated phenomena (like burrs from trimming or residual stress). Therefore, controlling material inflow is the most direct and fundamental reason for using bypass notches.
