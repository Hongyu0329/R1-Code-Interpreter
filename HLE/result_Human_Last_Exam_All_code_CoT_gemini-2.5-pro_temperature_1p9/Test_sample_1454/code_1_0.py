    Solves the problem by analyzing the properties of the set F.
    
    The set F is defined by the equation:
    F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4
    where D is a given set of 8 vectors. This means F is a fixed point of an operator G(S) = union_{d in D} (S+d)/4.

    Step 1: Identify all possible solutions for F.
    The problem states that F is a closed set in the unit square. This means F is compact.
    The operator G is a contraction on the space of compact sets.
    
    One trivial solution is the empty set, F = empty_set.
    G(empty_set) = empty_set, so F = empty_set is a valid solution.

    By the Contraction Mapping Principle, there is also a unique non-empty compact solution,
    which is the attractor of the Iterated Function System (IFS) defined by G.
    
    So the set of possible solutions for F is {empty_set, Attractor_F}.

    Step 2: Count the components for each possible F.
    The question asks for the number of components of F that are non-degenerate AND locally connected.
    
    Case A: F = empty_set.
    The empty set has no components. So, the number of components with any property is 0.

    Case B: F = Attractor_F.
    The structure of this non-empty attractor can be shown to be F = C x [0,1],
    where C is a Cantor set on the x-axis and [0,1] is the unit interval on the y-axis.
    The connected components of this set are the vertical line segments {c} x [0,1] for each c in C.
    - Each component (a line segment) is non-degenerate (it's not a single point).
    - Each component (a line segment) is locally connected.
    - The number of components is the number of points in the Cantor set C, which is uncountably infinite.

    Step 3: Determine the smallest possible number.
    The possible numbers of non-degenerate, locally connected components are 0 (from the empty set solution)
    and infinity (from the non-empty attractor solution).
    
    The smallest of these is 0.

    num_components_for_empty_set = 0
    # For the non-empty attractor, the number of components is uncountably infinite.
    # We represent infinity symbolically for comparison.
    num_components_for_attractor = float('inf')
    
    smallest_possible_number = min(num_components_for_empty_set, num_components_for_attractor)
    
    print("The set of possible solutions for F has two elements: the empty set and a non-empty fractal set.")
    print("For the empty set, the number of components with any property is 0.")
    print("For the non-empty fractal set, the number of components is uncountably infinite.")
    print("The question asks for the smallest possible number of components.")
    # The final equation is simply showing the minimum value.
    final_equation = f"min(0, infinity) = {int(smallest_possible_number)}"
    print(f"The calculation is: {final_equation}")
    print(f"Thus, the smallest possible number of nondegenerate and locally connected components of F is {int(smallest_possible_number)}.")
