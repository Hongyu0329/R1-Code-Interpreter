# The number of stable equilibrium points, m, is 1.
m = 1

# The second term in the expression is 2^4048.
# Python can handle very large integers, so we can calculate this directly.
val_power_of_two = 2**4048

# Now, we calculate the final result of m - 2^4048.
result = m - val_power_of_two

# As requested, we print each number in the final equation.
# The number '1', the value of 2**4048, and the final result.
print(f"The equation is {m} - 2**4048")
print(f"Calculating the values, we get: {m} - {val_power_of_two} = {result}")
