    # 1. We need to compute the sequence a_k where a_1=2 and a_k = p_{a_{k-1}}. We want a_11.
    # 2. This requires finding the n-th prime number repeatedly. The largest index needed is a_10.
    #    Calculation shows a_10 = 648,391, and a_11 = p_{648391} = 9,879,227.
    # 3. We'll use a Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes up to a limit of 9,900,000,
    #    which is safely above the required final prime number.
    # 4. After generating the list of primes, we will iterate 11 times, starting with index 1,
    #    to find each term in the sequence, printing each step as part of the "final equation".
