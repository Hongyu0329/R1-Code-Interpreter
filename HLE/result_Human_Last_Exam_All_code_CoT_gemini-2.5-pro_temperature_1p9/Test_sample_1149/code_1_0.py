# The lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri is a concavity on the skull.
# According to the scientific description of the holotype, this recess is
# divided by an oblique ridge into distinct sections.

# Number of depressions in the anterior part of the recess.
anterior_depression = 1

# Number of depressions in the posterior part of the recess.
posterior_depression = 1

# We calculate the total by summing the individual depressions.
total_depressions = anterior_depression + posterior_depression

print(f"The total number of depressions in the lacrimal recess is calculated by adding the anterior and posterior depressions.")
print(f"Calculation: {anterior_depression} + {posterior_depression} = {total_depressions}")
