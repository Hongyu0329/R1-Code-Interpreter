    "Based on the paleontological description of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull (SMNS 58022), the answer can be determined. The scientific literature, specifically the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, describes the lacrimal recess. This anatomical feature is noted to be divided by a ridge into a specific number of distinct depressions.\n\nI will write a simple Python script to represent this finding. The script will assign a value to the anterior depression and the posterior depression, then add them together to find the total.\n\n```python\n# The lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri is a concavity on the skull.\n# According to the scientific description of the holotype, this recess is\n# divided by an oblique ridge into distinct sections.\n\n# Number of depressions in the anterior part of the recess.\nanterior_depression = 1\n\n# Number of depressions in the posterior part of the recess.\nposterior_depression = 1\n\n# We calculate the total by summing the individual depressions.\ntotal_depressions = anterior_depression + posterior_depression\n\nprint(f\"The total number of depressions in the lacrimal recess is calculated by adding the anterior and posterior depressions.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {anterior_depression} + {posterior_depression} = {total_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
