    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Board and Rules:** The problem specifies a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. A \"toroidal\" board means it wraps around on the edges, both vertically and horizontally. We need to place 4 non-attacking queens.\n\n2.  **Understand Toroidal Attacks:** A queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a square `(r2, c2)` if any of the following conditions are met on an `N x N` board (here `N=5`):\n    *   **Same Row:** `r1 = r2`\n    *   **Same Column:** `c1 = c2`\n    *   **Same Diagonals (wrapped):** This is the key difference from a standard board. The diagonals also wrap around. This can be checked efficiently using modular arithmetic:\n        *   ` (r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N `\n        *   ` (r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N `\n\n3.  **Choose an Algorithm:** A brute-force search is feasible due to the small board size (25 squares) and the small number of queens (4). I will use a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n\n4.  **Count Combinations, Not Permutations:** Since the queens are identical, the order of placement does not matter. To ensure each valid set of 4 positions is counted only once, I will iterate through the 25 squares of the board in a fixed order (from index 0 to 24). When placing the next queen, the search will only consider squares with a higher index than the previously placed queen.\n\n5.  **Implementation:** The Python code will consist of:\n    *   A main recursive function, `solve(k, start_index, placements)`, which tries to place the `k`-th queen.\n    *   A helper function, `is_placement_safe(new_queen, placed_queens)`, that checks if placing a new queen conflicts with any of the queens already on the board according to the toroidal rules.\n    *   A counter that is incremented each time a valid arrangement of 4 queens is found.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the total count. The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" will be interpreted as printing the final resulting count.\n\n```python\n# The size of the toroidal board\nN = 5\n# The number of queens to place\nNUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n# A global counter to store the number of valid solutions\ncount = 0\n\ndef is_placement_safe(new_queen, placed_queens):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if placing a new queen at 'new_queen' is safe with respect to\n    the 'placed_queens' on the toroidal board.\n    \"\"\"\n    r_new, c_new = new_queen\n    for r_old, c_old in placed_queens:\n        # Check for attacks on the same row, column, or any of the wrapped diagonals\n        if (r_new == r_old or\n            c_new == c_old or\n            (r_new - c_new) % N == (r_old - c_old) % N or\n            (r_new + c_new) % N == (r_old + c_old) % N):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve(k, start_index, placements):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively finds and counts all valid placements of queens.\n    \n    k: The number of queens placed so far.\n    start_index: The linear index of the square to start searching from.
