def solve_path_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the number of distinct paths based on the reasoning above.

    The problem is interpreted as finding the number of distinct path images.
    A path's image is the set of points it covers. The variety of paths comes
    from the section between the two intersection points of the line and circle.

    Between these two points (P and Q), there are 3 elementary paths:
    1. The line segment (chord).
    2. The first circular arc.
    3. The second circular arc.

    A path can be constructed to traverse any non-empty combination of these 3
    elementary paths. The number of distinct paths is therefore the number of
    non-empty subsets of this set of 3 elementary paths.
