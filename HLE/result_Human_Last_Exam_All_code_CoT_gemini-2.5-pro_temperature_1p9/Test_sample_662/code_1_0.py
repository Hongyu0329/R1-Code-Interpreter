# --- Input Parameters ---

# Basic reproduction number (R0)
R0 = 3.0

# Percentage of vaccinated people who still get the infection (breakthrough rate)
breakthrough_rate_percent = 6.0

# --- Calculations ---

# Convert the breakthrough percentage to a decimal
breakthrough_rate_decimal = breakthrough_rate_percent / 100

# Step 1: Calculate Vaccine Efficacy (VE)
# VE is the proportion of vaccinated people who are protected from infection.
vaccine_efficacy = 1 - breakthrough_rate_decimal

# Step 2: Calculate the herd immunity threshold (HIT)
# This is the proportion of the population that must be immune to stop the spread.
herd_immunity_threshold = 1 - (1 / R0)

# Step 3: Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (p_c)
# This accounts for the vaccine not being 100% effective.
critical_coverage = herd_immunity_threshold / vaccine_efficacy

# --- Output ---
