    # --- Step 1 & 2: Define concepts and apply the Continuum Hypothesis ---
    # The set X is defined as {λ is a cardinal | for any sequence of ω_1 functions,
    # there is a bounded subsequence of size λ}.
    # This definition corresponds to X = {λ | λ < b}, where b is the unbounding number.
    # The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) implies that b = ω_1.
    b = "ω_1"
    
    # --- Step 3: Determine the order type γ of X ---
    # With b = ω_1, X is the set of cardinals less than ω_1.

    # For a limit ordinal λ, (α+1) ⋅ λ = sup{ (α+1)β | β < λ }. This is cofinal with
    # {αβ | β < λ}, whose sup is α ⋅ λ. So (ω+1) ⋅ ω_1 = ω ⋅ ω_1.
