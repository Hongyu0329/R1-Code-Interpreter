    "Here is a step-by-step plan to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points**: We start by finding the points $(d, u)$ in the phase plane where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are equal to zero. These are the points where the system is stationary.\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points**: We will linearize the system around each equilibrium point by computing the Jacobian matrix. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian at each point will tell us the nature of the equilibrium (e.g., node, spiral, saddle).\n3.  **Identify the separatrix**: A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different dynamic behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. We will focus on finding the equation for the manifold associated with the saddle point.\n4.  **Formulate the phase plane equation**: To find the equation of the trajectories, we will form a differential equation for $d$ as a function of $u$ by computing the ratio $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$.\n5.  **Solve the phase plane equation**: The resulting ODE for $d(u)$ is a Bernoulli equation. We will solve it using the substitution $z = 1/d$ to transform it into a linear ODE, which can then be solved using an integrating factor. This will give a general solution with an integration constant, $C$.\n6.  **Determine the specific separatrix**: We will use the condition that the separatrix must pass through the saddle point. This will allow us to determine the specific value of the constant $C$.\n7.  **Simplify and present the final equation**: Once $C$ is found, we will simplify the resulting equation for the separatrix and present it in a clear polynomial form. Finally, we will write a Python script to print out the coefficients of this final equation as requested.\n\n### Execution:\nFollowing the plan:\n*   The equilibrium points are found to be $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n*   Classification of these points reveals that $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node and $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point. The separatrix is the trajectory corresponding to the stable/unstable manifold of this saddle point.\n*   The phase plane equation $\\frac{dd}{du}$ is solved, yielding the general solution for the trajectories:\n    $\\frac{1}{d} u^3(u-1)^2 = C + u^2 - \\frac{2}{3}u^3$.\n*   For the trajectory to pass through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$, we must choose $C = -1/3$.\n*   With this value of $C$, the equation for the separatrix simplifies to $d = -\\frac{3u^3}{2u+1}$.\n*   Rearranging this gives the polynomial equation: $3u^3 + 2ud + d = 0$.\n\nThe following Python code prints the coefficients of this final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# The separatrix for the given system of differential equations is a curve\n# in the (d, u) phase plane. Through analysis, this curve can be found\n# to satisfy a polynomial equation.\n#\n# The equation has the form:\n# A * u**3 + B * u * d + C * d = 0\n#\n# The following code defines and prints the coefficients A, B, and C.\n\n# Coefficients of the separatrix equation\nA = 3\nB = 2\nC = 1\n\n# Print the equation in a readable format\nu, d = sp.symbols('u d')\nequation = A * u**3 + B * u * d + C * d\nprint(\"The equation for the separatrix is:\")\nprint(f\"{equation} = 0\")\n\n# As requested, output each number in the final equation\nprint(\"\\nThe coefficients of the equation are:\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient of u**3 (A): {A}\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient of u*d  (B): {B}\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient of d    (C): {C}\")\n\n# Final Answer Check\n# The equation can be written as d*(B*u + C) = -A*u**3\n# d = -A*u**3 / (B*u + C)\n# Let's substitute the coefficients to get the explicit form for d(u).\n# d = -3*u**3 / (2*u + 1)\n# We can verify that as u -> 1, d -> -3/(2+1) = -1.\n# Also, as u -> 0, d -> 0.\n# This matches the saddle point (-1, 1) and the equilibrium (0, 0)\n# which the separatrix connects.\n```\n<<<3*u**3+2*u*d+d=0>>>"
