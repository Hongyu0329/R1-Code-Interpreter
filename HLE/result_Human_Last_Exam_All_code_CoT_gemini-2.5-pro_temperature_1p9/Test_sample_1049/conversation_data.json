    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Convolution:** The sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum is $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k c_{n-k}$.\n\n2.  **Generating Functions:** The generating function for the sequence $\\{S_n\\}$ is the product of the generating functions for $\\{a_k\\}$ and $\\{c_k\\}$.\n    *   The generating function for $c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   Let $A(x)$ be the generating function for $a_k$. Then the generating function for $S_n$ is $G(x) = A(x)C(x)$.\n\n3.  **Find A(x):** We can find $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$ by repeatedly applying the operator $\\mathcal{O} = 2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1$.\n    If we define $C_p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^p \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$, we have $C_0(x) = C(x)$ and $C_{p+1}(x) = \\mathcal{O}C_p(x)$.\n    This process, though systematic, is algebraically intensive. The result for $p=5$ is:\n    $A(x) = C_5(x) = \\frac{4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1}{(1-4x)^{11/2}}$\n\n4.  **Find G(x):**\n    $G(x) = A(x)C(x) = \\frac{4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1}{(1-4x)^{11/2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-4x)^{1/2}}$\n    $G(x) = \\frac{4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1}{(1-4x)^6}$\n\n5.  **Find the Closed Form:** To find $S_n$, we need to extract the coefficient of $x^n$ from $G(x)$. This will result in an expression of the form $S_n = 4^n P(n)$, where $P(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5. We can find this polynomial by computing the first few values of $S_n$ and using Newton's series (a method based on finite differences).\n\n6.  **Execute the plan with Python:** The following Python code will calculate the first 6 values of $S_n/4^n$, determine the coefficients of the polynomial $P(n)$ in the binomial basis $\\binom{n}{k}$, and then print the resulting closed-form expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of the sum for a given integer n.\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2(n-k), n-k)\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        # Calculate each term in the sum\n        try:\n            term = (2*k+1)**5 * math.comb(2*k, k) * math.comb(2*(n-k), n-k)\n            total += term\n        except ValueError:\n            # math.comb(n, k) raises ValueError for k < 0 or k > n.\n            # This handles edge cases though the loop range is safe.\n            pass\n    return total\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the polynomial P(n) such that S_n = 4^n * P(n)\n    and prints the closed-form expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We need 6 points for a degree 5 polynomial\n    num_points = 6\n    p_values = [calculate_sum(n) // (4**n) for n in range(num_points)]\n    \n    # Compute the forward difference table to find Newton series coefficients\n    diff_table = [p_values]\n    for i in range(num_points - 1):\n        last_diff = diff_table[-1]\n        new_diff = [last_diff[j+1] - last_diff[j] for j in range(len(last_diff) - 1)]\n        diff_table.append(new_diff)\n    \n    # The coefficients are the first elements of each difference list\n    coeffs = [d[0] for d in diff_table]\n    \n    # Print the final closed-form expression\n    # The expression is P(n) = sum_{k=0 to 5} coeffs[k] * C(n, k)\n    print(\"The closed form of the sum is S_n = 4^n * P(n), where P(n) is the polynomial:\")\n    \n    final_expression_parts = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n        if c != 0:\n            final_expression_parts.append(f\"{c} * C(n, {i})\")\n            \n    print(\"P(n) = \" + \" + \".join(final_expression_parts))\n    print(\"\\nWhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient 'n choose k'.
