The direct answer to the question is NO.

For the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a periodic domain, it is a well-established mathematical theorem that for any smooth, divergence-free initial data, a unique, smooth solution exists for all time. This is known as the "global regularity" result, and it precludes the possibility of a finite-time blow-up.

The proof relies on establishing 'a priori' bounds on the solution's norms, which show they cannot become infinite. Here is a sketch of the key steps:

Step 1: The Energy Estimate (Bound on the L^2 norm)
------------------------------------------------------
We start by taking the L^2 inner product (integrating over the torus) of the Navier-Stokes equation with the velocity field 'u' itself. This tells us about the evolution of the total kinetic energy, ||u||_L2^2. The crucial feature is that the nonlinear term (u . nabla(u)) vanishes in this process due to the incompressibility condition (nabla . u = 0). This leads to the fundamental energy equality:

Equation 1:
d/dt ||u||^2 + 2 * ||nabla(u)||^2 = 0

This equation shows that the kinetic energy of the fluid never increases. The term ||nabla(u)||^2 represents the rate of energy dissipation due to viscosity. This guarantees that the L^2 norm of the velocity 'u' is bounded for all time by its initial value.

Step 2: The Vorticity Estimate (Bound on the H^1 norm)
------------------------------------------------------
While the energy bound is good, it's not enough to prevent blow-up in the derivatives. The key to the 2D problem is to analyze the vorticity, which is the curl of the velocity, omega = curl(u). In 2D, omega is a scalar field, and it obeys the vorticity equation:

d_t(omega) + u . nabla(omega) = Delta(omega)

We can now perform an energy estimate on the vorticity itself by taking the L^2 inner product with omega. Just like in Step 1, the nonlinear advection term (u . nabla(omega)) vanishes because 'u' is divergence-free. This gives a bound on the L^2 norm of the vorticity, a quantity known as enstrophy.

Equation 2:
d/dt ||omega||^2 + 2 * ||nabla(omega)||^2 = 0

This second equation is the mathematical reason why 2D Navier-Stokes is well-behaved. It shows that the total enstrophy, ||omega||^2, is also bounded for all time.
Since ||nabla(u)||_L2 is controlled by ||omega||_L2, this proves that the H^1 Sobolev norm of 'u' is also bounded for all time.

Step 3: Bootstrapping to Full Regularity
-------------------------------------------
With the H^1 norm globally bounded, one can continue this process ("bootstrap") to show that all higher-order derivatives of 'u' also remain bounded for all time, provided the initial data u_0 was smooth.

Conclusion
----------
Since all derivatives of the velocity field 'u' can be shown to remain finite, the solution remains smooth for all time. Therefore, no singularity or "blow-up" can occur in finite time for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations.
