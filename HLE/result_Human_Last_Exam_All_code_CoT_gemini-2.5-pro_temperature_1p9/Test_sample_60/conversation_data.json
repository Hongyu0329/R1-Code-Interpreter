    "My plan is to simulate each of the three Turing Machines provided. I will write a Python script to do this.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Rules:** The rules for each machine are given as a string. I will interpret this string as a sequence of rules for states A, B, C, D, and E. For each state, there are two rules: one for reading a '0' and one for reading a '1'. A rule like `B1L` means \"Go to state B, write 1, and move the tape head Left.\"\n2.  **Create a Turing Machine Simulator:** The simulator will have the following components:\n    *   A representation of the infinite tape, initially filled with zeros. A Python dictionary is perfect for this.\n    *   A variable to track the current state, which starts at 'A'.\n    *   A variable for the tape head's position, starting at 0.\n    *   A counter for the number of steps.\n3.  **Simulate Each Machine:** The simulator will run a loop. In each step, it will:\n    *   Read the symbol on the tape at the current head position.\n    *   Find the corresponding rule based on the current state and the symbol read.\n    *   Execute the rule: write a new symbol to the tape, move the head, and transition to the next state.\n    *   Increment the step counter.\n    *   The simulation stops when the machine enters the 'H' (Halt) state.\n4.  **Compare and Report:** After running the simulation for all three machines, I will compare the number of steps each one took to halt. I will then print the step count for each machine and identify which machine took the most steps, along with its final step count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef parse_rules(rule_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a compact Turing Machine rule string into a usable dictionary.\n    Format assumes states 'A' through 'E' and rules for reading 0 and 1.\n    e.g., \"B1L B0R...\" means State A, read 0 -> (B, 1, L); read 1 -> (B, 0, R)\n    \"\"\"\n    states = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\n    rule_parts = rule_string.split()\n    \n    rules = {}\n    if len(rule_parts) != len(states) * 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid rule string format\")\n\n    for i, state_char in enumerate(states):\n        # Rule for reading '0' is at index 2*i\n        rule_for_0_str = rule_parts[i * 2]\n        # Rule for reading '1' is at index 2*i + 1\n        rule_for_1_str = rule_parts[i * 2 + 1]\n        \n        # Parse the rule for reading '0'\n        next_state_0 = rule_for_0_str[0]\n        write_symbol_0 = int(rule_for_0_str[1])\n        move_dir_0 = rule_for_0_str[2]\n        \n        # Parse the rule for reading '1'\n        next_state_1 = rule_for_1_str[0]\n        write_symbol_1 = int(rule_for_1_str[1])\n        move_dir_1 = rule_for_1_str[2]\n        \n        rules[state_char] = {\n            0: (next_state_0, write_symbol_0, move_dir_0),\n            1: (next_state_1, write_symbol_1, move_dir_1)\n        }\n    return rules\n\ndef simulate_turing_machine(rules, max_steps=200000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a Turing Machine given a set of rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    tape = defaultdict(int)  # The tape is infinite and defaults to 0\n    head_position = 0\n    current_state = 'A'\n    steps = 0\n\n    while current_state != 'H' and steps < max_steps:\n        # Read the symbol from the tape\n        read_symbol = tape[head_position]\n\n        # Get the appropriate rule\n        try:\n            next_state, write_symbol, move_dir = rules[current_state][read_symbol]\n        except KeyError:\n            print(f\"Error: No rule found for state '{current_state}' reading '{read_symbol}'.
