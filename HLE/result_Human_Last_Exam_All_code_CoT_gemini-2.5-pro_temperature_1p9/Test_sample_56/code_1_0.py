    In John Rawls's theory, "reciprocity" is a central idea within "justice as fairness." It means that society should be a fair system of cooperation for mutual benefit. A crucial point is that citizens' obligations to uphold the system (their civic duties) are conditional. These obligations hold firm provided that the institutions of society are just and that others are also doing their part. If the system is unjust and fails to benefit all its members—especially the least advantaged, as per Rawls's "difference principle"—then the moral grounds for the disadvantaged to uphold their end of the bargain are significantly weakened.
