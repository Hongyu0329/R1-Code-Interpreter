    "The unique architectural feature in the Piazza della Rotonda, which was attached to the Pantheon, was a pair of bell towers.\n\nThey were designed by the famous baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini and added in the 17th century. However, they were widely disliked by the Roman populace, who mockingly nicknamed them \"le orecchie d'asino,\" or \"the donkey's ears.\"\n\nWhile your question mentions the year 1950, this feature was actually removed much earlier, in 1883, to restore the Pantheon to what was believed to be its more classical, original appearance.\n\n<<<Two bell towers known as \"the donkey's ears\".>>>"
