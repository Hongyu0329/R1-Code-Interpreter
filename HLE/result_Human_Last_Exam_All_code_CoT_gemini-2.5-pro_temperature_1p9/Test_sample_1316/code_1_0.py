    print("Analyzing the genetic puzzle from Misi√≥n Bridges' Drosophila experiments.\n")

    # Step 1: Define the key observation
    print("--- Observation ---")
    print("An unexpected male offspring has been observed with the following characteristics:")
    print(" - Chromosomal Makeup: X0 (one X chromosome, no Y chromosome)")
    print(" - Phenotype: Determined by the single X chromosome, which must have been inherited from the father.")
    print("\nThis means the mother must have produced an egg with NO X chromosome (a 'nullo-gamete').\n")

    # Step 2: Identify the cellular mechanism
    print("--- Cellular Mechanism: Non-disjunction ---")
    print("The production of a gamete lacking a chromosome is caused by non-disjunction, the failure of chromosomes to separate during meiosis.")
    print("In this case, it is a non-disjunction of the X chromosomes in the female during egg formation (oogenesis).\n")

    # Step 3: Differentiate between Meiosis I and Meiosis II
    print("--- Pinpointing the Stage: Meiosis I vs. Meiosis II ---")
    print("Non-disjunction in the female can occur at two stages:")
    print("1. Meiosis I: Homologous X chromosomes fail to separate. This one event produces gametes that are either XX or 'nullo' (0).")
    print("2. Meiosis II: Sister chromatids of an X chromosome fail to separate. This can also produce 'nullo' gametes.")
    print("\nBridges' theory was powerful because it explained not just the X0 males but also exceptional XXY females from the same cross.")
    print("The XXY females arise from an XX egg. Since Meiosis I non-disjunction produces both XX and 'nullo' eggs from a single error, it provides the most complete explanation for all the results.\n")

    # Step 4: Final conclusion
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The observation of an X0 male points to a 'nullo' egg from the mother, which is created by non-disjunction of her X chromosomes.")
    print("The most specific and comprehensive explanation for this, in the context of Bridges' experiments, is Non-disjunction of the X chromosome in female meiosis I.")
