    "To find the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram, we can use the topological formulas that govern these diagrams. I will write a Python script that walks through the derivation step-by-step to find the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Formulas**: Start with the two fundamental equations for diagram topology:\n    *   The loop formula: `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   The vertex degree formula: `n * V = 2 * I + E`\n    (where L=loops, I=internal lines, V=vertices, E=external lines, n=fields per vertex).\n2.  **Combine and Simplify**: Combine these equations to express the number of vertices (V) in terms of the number of loops (L), external lines (E), and the interaction type (n).\n3.  **Find Minimum**: We are given L=2. I will then search for the combination of the smallest possible integer values for V (starting from V=1), E (starting from E=0), and n (starting from n=3) that satisfies the derived equation.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The first valid solution found for the smallest V will be our minimum. The script will print each step of this logical deduction, including the specific values that lead to the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagram_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman\n    diagram for a general interacting scalar field theory by deriving and solving\n    the topological relations.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # V = number of vertices\n    # I = number of internal lines (propagators)\n    # E = number of external lines\n    # L = number of loops\n    # n = number of fields at each vertex (e.g., n=4 for phi^4 theory)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: State the topological relations for a Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"The number of loops (L) is related to the number of internal lines (I) and vertices (V) by:\")\n    print(\"L = I - V + 1  (Equation 1)\")\n    print(\"\\nFor an interaction of type φ^n, n lines meet at each vertex.\")\n    print(\"The total number of line-ends (n*V) must equal the sum of connections to internal lines (2*I) and external lines (E):\")\n    print(\"n * V = 2 * I + E  (Equation 2)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Combine the equations to solve for the number of vertices V.\")\n    print(\"From Equation 1, we can express I in terms of L and V:\")\n    print(\"I = L + V - 1\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstitute this expression for I into Equation 2:\")\n    print(\"n * V = 2 * (L + V - 1) + E\")\n    print(\"n * V = 2*L + 2*V - 2 + E\")\n    print(\"n * V - 2*V = 2*L - 2 + E\")\n    print(\"V * (n - 2) = 2*L - 2 + E\")\n    print(\"\\nThis gives our main formula for V:\")\n    print(\"V = (2*L - 2 + E) / (n - 2)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Apply the given conditions to the formula.\")\n    print(\"We are given that the diagram has two loops, so we set L = 2.\")\n    L = 2\n    print(f\"Substituting L = {L} into the formula for V:\")\n    print(f\"V = (2*{L} - 2 + E) / (n - 2)\")\n    print(f\"V = ({2*L - 2} + E) / (n - 2)\")\n    print(\"V = (2 + E) / (n - 2)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Find the minimum integer value for V.\")\n    print(\"We need to find integers V > 0, E >= 0, and n >= 3 (for an interaction to occur) that satisfy the equation.\")\n    print(\"Let's test the smallest possible integer value for V, which is 1.\")\n    \n    V_test = 1\n    print(f\"\\nIf we assume V = {V_test}, the equation becomes:\")\n    print(f\"{V_test} = (2 + E) / (n - 2)\")\n    print(\"\\nThis implies: n - 2 = 2 + E, or rearranging for n:\")\n    print(\"n = E + 4\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nNow we need to find the minimal non-negative integer E that gives a valid interaction type n (where n >= 3).\")\n    print(\"The smallest possible value for E (number of external lines) is 0 for a vacuum diagram.\")\n    E_sol = 0\n    print(f\"Let's choose E = {E_sol}.\")\n    \n    n_sol = E_sol + 4\n    \n    print(f\"Then the interaction type n must be: n = {E_sol} + 4 = {n_sol}.\")\n    print(f\"This is a valid interaction (n={n_sol} is >= 3), corresponding to a φ^4 theory.\")\n    print(\"\\nSo, a valid diagram exists with:\")\n    print(f\"  Loops, L = {L}\")\n    print(f\"  Vertices, V = {V_test}\")\n    print(f\"  External lines, E = {E_sol}\")\n    print(f\"  Interaction type, n = {n_sol}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThis corresponds to the 'figure-eight' vacuum diagram, which has 1 vertex and 2 internal lines.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"Since we found a valid physical scenario for V = 1, and V must be a positive integer, the minimum number of vertices is 1.\")\n    \n    final_answer = 1\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {final_answer}\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_feynman_diagram_vertices()\n```"
