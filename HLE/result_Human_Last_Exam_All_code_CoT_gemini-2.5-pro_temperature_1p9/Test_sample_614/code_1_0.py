# Plan:
# 1. Establish the order of the five entities based on positional clues.
#    - The fifth is last (5th position).
#    - Number three is 4th (protects the last).
#    - Number 1 is 1st.
#    - Number 2 is 2nd, and Number 4 is 3rd ("goes behind two").
#    - Order of entities: [Number 1, Number 2, Number 4, Number three, the fifth]

# 2. Assign the numeric values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to these entities.
#    - Value of Number 1 is 1 ("weakest").
#    - Value of Number three is 5 ("strongest").
#    - Remaining values {2, 3, 4} for {Number 2, Number 4, the fifth}.
#    - Value of Number 2 is 4 ("best" of the remaining).
#    - Value of Number 4 is 2 ("likes two" - value 4 - and goes behind).
#    - Value of the fifth is 3 (the one left over, "who never had a thing").

# 3. Construct the final sequence from the values in their determined order.
#    - Position 1: Value of Number 1 = 1
#    - Position 2: Value of Number 2 = 4
#    - Position 3: Value of Number 4 = 2
#    - Position 4: Value of Number three = 5
#    - Position 5: Value of the fifth = 3

final_sequence = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3]

# The riddle asks to output each number in the final equation.
# We will print the solved sequence.
print("The final sequence of numbers is:")
print(f"{final_sequence[0]}, {final_sequence[1]}, {final_sequence[2]}, {final_sequence[3]}, {final_sequence[4]}")
