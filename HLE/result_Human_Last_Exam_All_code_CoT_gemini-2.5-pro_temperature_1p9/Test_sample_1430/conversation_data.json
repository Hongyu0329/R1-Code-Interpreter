    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the problem:** The goal is to find the minimum and maximum possible rank of the Néron-Severi group ($\\rho$) for the 15th symmetric power ($X = C^{(15)}$) of a genus 3 Riemann surface ($C$).\n\n2.  **Find the governing formula:** The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve, $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, is related to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian, $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C))$. The specific formula for a curve of genus $g$ and a symmetric power of degree $d$ is $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(\\text{Jac}(C)) + 1$, provided that the condition $d \\ge 2g-1$ is met.\n\n3.  **Check the condition:** For this problem, we have genus $g=3$ and degree $d=15$. I will verify that $15 \\ge 2(3)-1$. Since the condition holds, the formula is applicable.\n\n4.  **Determine the range for $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C))$:** The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C))$ for a genus 3 curve $C$.\n    *   **Minimum:** This occurs for a *generic* curve $C$. In this case, the Jacobian $\\text{Jac}(C)$ has the minimal number of endomorphisms (only the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$), which leads to the minimal rank $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C))=1$.\n    *   **Maximum:** The rank is bounded by $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C)) \\le g^2$. For $g=3$, the maximum theoretical rank is $3^2=9$. This maximum is achieved for special curves whose Jacobians have complex multiplication (CM). A known example is the Fermat quartic curve ($x^4+y^4+z^4=0$), a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian has a Néron-Severi rank of 9.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer:** Using the formula from step 2 and the range for $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C))$ from step 4, I will calculate the smallest and largest possible ranks for $X=C^{(15)}$.\n    *   Smallest $\\rho(X) = \\text{min}(\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C))) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   Largest $\\rho(X) = \\text{max}(\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C))) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n6.  **Code the solution:** I will write a Python script to perform and document these calculations, printing each step of the logical derivation and the final equations.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riemann_surface_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group \n    of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3  # Genus of the Riemann surface C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group, rho(X), for X = C^({d}), where C is a curve of genus g = {g}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: State the formula relating rho(X) to the Jacobian of C.\n    print(\"Step 1: State the relevant mathematical formula.\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of a curve C, rho(C^(d)), is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian, rho(Jac(C)).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: rho(C^(d)) = rho(Jac(C)) + 1\")\n    print(\"This formula is valid under the condition that d >= 2*g - 1.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Check if the condition for the formula holds.\n    condition_val = 2 * g - 1\n    print(\"Step 2: Check the condition.\")\n    print(f\"For this problem, g = {g} and d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The condition is {d} >= 2*({g}) - 1, which simplifies to {d} >= {condition_val}.\")\n    if d >= condition_val:\n        print(\"The condition holds, so we can proceed with the formula.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The condition does not hold, so the formula cannot be applied directly.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the range of rho(Jac(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the minimum and maximum possible values for rho(Jac(C)).\")\n    \n    # Minimum rank for the Jacobian\n    min_rho_J = 1\n    print(f\"The minimum rank, rho_min(Jac(C)) = {min_rho_J}, occurs for a generic curve C, whose Jacobian has only the trivial endomorphisms (multiplication by integers).\")\n\n    # Maximum rank for the Jacobian\n    max_rho_J = g**2\n    print(f\"The maximum rank, rho_max(Jac(C)) = {max_rho_J}, is achieved for special curves with Complex Multiplication (CM).
