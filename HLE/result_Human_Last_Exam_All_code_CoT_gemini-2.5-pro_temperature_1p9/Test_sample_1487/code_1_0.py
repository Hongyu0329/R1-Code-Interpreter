def solve_hilbert_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem by following a symbolic derivation and then performing the final calculation.

    The derivation shows that:
    1. By the Riesz Representation Theorem, z(y) = (alpha, y). The given conditions imply (alpha, y_i) = 1/(i+1).
    2. We can express alpha in the orthogonal basis {y_i}: alpha = sum(c_i * y_i).
    3. The coefficients are c_i = (alpha, y_i) / ||y_i||^2 = (1/(i+1)) / 2 = 1 / (2*(i+1)).
    4. The squared norm is ||alpha||^2 = sum(|c_i|^2 * ||y_i||^2)
                                       = sum( (1/(2*(i+1)))^2 * 2 )
                                       = sum( 1 / (2*(i+1)^2) )
                                       = (1/2) * sum( 1 / (i+1)^2 for i=1 to inf).
    5. The sum is sum(1/n^2 for n=2 to inf) = (pi^2/6) - 1.
    6. Therefore, ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1).

    Now, we calculate the final expression.
