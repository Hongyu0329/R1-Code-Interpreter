    "My plan is to solve this musical puzzle by mapping the colors of Newton's color circle to the notes of a musical scale.\n\n1.  **Establish the Correspondence:** I will use the common mapping where the seven colors of the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) correspond to the seven notes of the C-major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).\n2.  **Identify the Colors:** The question defines a range between two points:\n    *   **Start of the range:** \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In the context of subtractive color mixing (like pigments), yellow and blue combine to make **green**.\n    *   **End of the range:** \"blue itself\".\n3.  **Find the Corresponding Notes:** I will find the musical notes associated with green and blue based on the established mapping.\n4.  **Determine the Final Note:** The question asks for the single musical note that corresponds to this range. Since the range is defined as starting from the color green and ending at the color blue, the most logical answer is the note that corresponds to the endpoint of this range, which is blue.\n5.  **Generate Code:** The Python code will store the color-note mapping, perform the lookup, and print the logical steps and the final answer in an equation-like format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_color_note_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by mapping Newton's colors to musical notes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish the mapping between colors and musical notes\n    # based on Newton's circle and the diatonic scale.\n    color_to_note = {\n        'red': 'C',\n        'orange': 'D',\n        'yellow': 'E',\n        'green': 'F',\n        'blue': 'G',\n        'indigo': 'A',\n        'violet': 'B'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors that define the range from the question.\n    # The color from combining yellow and blue is green.\n    start_color = 'green'\n    # The end of the range is blue itself.\n    end_color = 'blue'\n\n    # Step 3: Find the notes corresponding to these colors.\n    start_note = color_to_note[start_color]\n    end_note = color_to_note[end_color]\n\n    # Step 4: Determine the final note.
