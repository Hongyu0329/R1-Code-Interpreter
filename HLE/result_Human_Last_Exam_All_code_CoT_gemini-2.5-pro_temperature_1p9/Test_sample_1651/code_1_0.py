    # Let X = beta(R) be the Stone-Cech compactification of the real numbers R.
    # Let X* = X \\ R be the remainder.
    # Let f: R -> R be a continuous function and F: X -> X be its unique continuous extension.
    # We are looking for the smallest non-zero number of fixed points of F in X*.

    # The argument relies on the symmetry of R.
    # Consider an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x).
    # Let I be the extension of the map i(x) = -x.
    # For an odd function f, the extension F commutes with I, i.e., F(I(p)) = I(F(p)).
    # If p is a fixed point in X* (so F(p) = p), then I(p) is also a fixed point:
    # F(I(p)) = I(F(p)) = I(p).

    # For any point p in the remainder X*, p is distinct from I(p).
    # This means fixed points for an odd function come in pairs {p, I(p)}.
    # Therefore, if an odd function has a finite non-zero number of fixed points
    # in the remainder, the number must be an even integer.
    
    # The smallest non-zero even integer is 2.
    # While it's very difficult to prove that a function with exactly one fixed point
    # cannot exist, or to prove that there are functions with a finite number of
    # fixed points, this symmetry argument provides the most plausible answer.
