def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes the provided Go puzzle to determine the killing move for White.

    Board State:
    - Black Stones (X): A2, B3, B4, C1, C2
    - White Stones (O): B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5
    - To move: White

    Visualization of the corner:
      A B C D
    5 . O . O
    4 . X O .
    3 . X O .
    2 X . X O
    1 . . X O

    Analysis:
    1. The Black stones form a loose, disconnected shape. For Black to make a living group
       (a group with two "eyes" that cannot be captured), they must connect their stones.

    2. The most critical point for Black is B2. If Black plays at B2, all the stones
       connect into a single large group. This group has enough space and potential
       (e.g., at points A1, B1) to form two eyes and live.

    3. The principle in Go is "your opponent's vital point is your vital point".
       Since B2 is critical for Black's life, it is also the critical point for
       White to attack.

    4. If White plays at B2, it prevents Black from connecting. This move splits Black's
       formation into three separate, weak groups: {A2}, {B3, B4}, and {C1, C2}.

    5. These small groups are now isolated and surrounded. They lack the necessary space to
       create two eyes each and will inevitably be captured by White. For example, after
       White plays B2, the corner groups {A2} and {C1, C2} can be attacked and captured,
       as they cannot escape or make a living shape in such a cramped area.

    Conclusion:
    Any move other than B2 allows Black to play B2 and live. Therefore, the only move
    that initiates a kill sequence is B2.
