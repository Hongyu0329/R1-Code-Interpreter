    "Here are the two problems with the JTB definition of knowledge, besides Gettier problems, under the given constraints.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the first problem**: The \"Justification\" condition leads to a logical paradox known as the infinite regress problem. To be knowledge, a belief requires justification. That justification, in turn, must also be justified, leading to an endless chain.\n2.  **Identify the second problem**: The \"Truth\" condition is external and inaccessible to the believer. An individual can have a well-justified belief, but they possess no independent method to confirm if that belief is objectively true, as they cannot step outside their own subjective experience to check against reality.\n3.  **Illustrate with code**: I will write a single Python script that uses functions and classes to metaphorically demonstrate both of these philosophical problems. The first part of the script will show the infinite regress, and the second part will show the agent's inability to access objective truth.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef demonstrate_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script conceptually illustrates two major problems with the\n    JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of Knowledge, assuming\n    our only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification (The 'J' Problem) ---\")\n    print(\"For a belief to be justified, it must be supported by a reason.\")\n    print(\"But that reason, being a belief itself, must also be justified.\\n\")\n\n    def get_justification_for(belief, level=1):\n        \"\"\"A recursive function to demonstrate infinite regress.\"\"\"\n        if level > 4: # Add a base case to prevent an actual infinite loop\n            print(\"... and so on, ad infinitum.
