Part A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable?

Yes. The reasoning is as follows:
1.  The described machine is a type of Random Access Machine (RAM).
2.  Its instruction set includes memory access (LOAD/STORE), arithmetic (ADD), universal logic (BITWISENAND can be used to construct NOT, AND, OR), and conditional control flow (BRANCHIFZERO).
3.  A machine with these capabilities is known to be Turing-complete. This means it can compute any function that a universal Turing machine can compute, given sufficient resources (memory and register space).
4.  The problem states that for any program L, we can assume machine parameters R, A, W are sufficiently large.
5.  A "boopable" function is one that can be computed by a program L on this machine.
6.  Since the machine is Turing-complete, any function it computes must be a Turing-computable function. Therefore, every boopable function is Turing-computable.

    explanation_B = """
Part B: Suppose (R,A,W)=(64,64,512). Does there exist a program L of length <= 2^32+50 such that, for all x in [0, 2^32), L maps x to x and halts in <= x+50 many steps?

Yes. Such a program can be constructed using self-modifying code. A simple loop is too slow (approx. 4x steps). The efficient approach is to jump into a pre-written block of BOOP instructions.

The plan is as follows:
1.  **Program Layout (Length = 2^32 + 50):**
    -   Memory [0...47]: Setup code (48 instructions).
    -   Memory [48]: A slot for a dynamically generated instruction.
    -   Memory [49 ... 2^32+48]: A pre-written block of 2^32 BOOP instructions (a "BOOP sled").
    -   Memory [2^32+49]: A HALT instruction. Let's call this HALT_ADDR.

2.  **Execution Flow:**
    -   The input `x` is in register 0.
    -   **Setup (48 steps):** The code at [0-47] performs two main tasks:
        a. It calculates the required jump address `J = HALT_ADDR - x`.
        b. It constructs the instruction `I = "BRANCHIFZERO J, r_zero"` in a register. (r_zero holds 0).
        c. The last instruction of setup, at address 47, is `STORE 48 <- I`.
    -   **Dynamic Branch (1 step):** The Program Counter is now 48. The machine executes the newly written branch instruction, jumping the PC to address `J`.
    -   **Booping (x steps):** The PC is at `J = HALT_ADDR - x`. It executes the BOOP instructions from `J` up to `HALT_ADDR - 1`. This results in `(HALT_ADDR - 1) - J + 1 = (HALT_ADDR - 1) - (HALT_ADDR - x) + 1 = x` BOOPs.
    -   **Halt (1 step):** The PC reaches HALT_ADDR and the program terminates.

3.  **Total Time Calculation:**
    - The total time is the sum of the time for each phase.
    - Time(x) = (Setup steps) + (Dynamic Branch step) + (BOOP steps) + (Halt step)
