    "To determine the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we will follow a step-by-step analysis. This analysis can be complex, and executing it requires a computer algebra system. However, the logical steps can be presented in a script that outlines the proof.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Define the base field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ and the extension element $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The field is $L=K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\n2.  Determine the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$. This involves checking if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$.\n3.  The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$. We will study its structure.\n4.  $G$ is a group extension of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$ by $\\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$.\n5.  We analyze the properties of this extension by checking if the automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ can be lifted to automorphisms of the same order in $G$. This depends on certain norm conditions.\n6.  Based on the orders of the lifted automorphisms, we can identify the group structure from the candidates of groups of order 8 ($C_8, C_4 \\times C_2, C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2, D_4, Q_8$).\n\nThe following Python code explains the reasoning to reach the final conclusion. Note that the functions `is_square_in_number_field` are mock-ups for what would be complex calculations in a real computer algebra system like SageMath or SymPy.\n\n```python\ndef is_square_in_number_field(number_to_check, field_radical):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a placeholder function to represent a non-trivial computation in number theory.\n    It checks if a given number `number_to_check` is a perfect square in the number field Q(sqrt(field_radical)).\n    The results are based on detailed mathematical analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Is 2 a square in Q(sqrt(3))?
