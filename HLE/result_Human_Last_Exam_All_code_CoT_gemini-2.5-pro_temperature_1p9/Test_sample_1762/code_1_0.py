# The problem asks for the number of different homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with a given set of properties.
# Based on topological analysis, we determined that any such space X
# must be homeomorphic to the real line, ℝ.
#
# Let's break down the reasoning that leads to a single class:
# 1. X is a one-to-one continuous image of ℝ. This implies that removing any single point
#    from X will disconnect the space.
# 2. X is also a connected, locally compact metric space, which means it is a 1-manifold.
# 3. Among the 1-manifolds (ℝ, S¹, [0,1], [0,1)), only ℝ has the property that
#    every point is a cut-point.
# 4. Therefore, X must be homeomorphic to ℝ.
# 5. We verify that ℝ itself satisfies all the given properties, confirming it as a valid model.
#
# Since all spaces satisfying the conditions belong to the same homeomorphism class as ℝ,
# there is only one such class.

# The final answer is the number of homeomorphism classes.
number_of_classes = 1

# The prompt requires printing the final answer.
# The number in the final 'equation' is simply the count we found.
