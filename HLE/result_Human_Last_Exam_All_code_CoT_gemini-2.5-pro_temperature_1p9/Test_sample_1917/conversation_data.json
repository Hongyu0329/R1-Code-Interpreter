    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the problem:** The goal is to find the number of unique values (cardinality) in the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. Here, $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$ is the set of natural numbers.\n\n2.  **Look for a pattern:** The values are generated by the sequence $s_a = a^a \\pmod{22}$. Calculating the first few terms by hand can be tedious and might not reveal the full set. A better approach is to check if the sequence is periodic.\n\n3.  **Establish periodicity:** A sequence of the form $a^a \\pmod n$ is periodic. The period is related to the least common multiple of $n$ and the Carmichael function $\\lambda(n)$.\n    *   For $n=22$, the base $a$ is taken modulo 22.\n    *   The exponent $a$ behaves according to modulus $\\lambda(22)$. The Carmichael function $\\lambda(22) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\lambda(2), \\lambda(11)) = \\operatorname{lcm}(1, 10) = 10$.\n    *   The sequence of pairs $(a \\pmod{22}, a \\pmod{10})$ repeats every $\\operatorname{lcm}(22, 10) = 110$ terms. This suggests that the sequence $s_a$ is periodic with a period that divides 110.\n\n4.  **Prove the period:** I will show that $s_{a+110} = s_a$ for any integer $a \\geq 1$.\n    *   $s_{a+110} = (a+110)^{a+110} \\pmod{22}$.\n    *   Since $110$ is a multiple of $22$, $a+110 \\equiv a \\pmod{22}$.\n    *   This simplifies the expression to $s_{a+110} \\equiv a^{a+110} \\pmod{22}$.\n    *   Using the property $a^{k+m} = a^k \\cdot a^m$, we get $a^{a+110} = a^a \\cdot a^{110}$.\n    *   The periodicity holds if $a^a \\cdot a^{110} \\equiv a^a \\pmod{22}$ for all $a \\ge 1$. This can be confirmed using the Chinese Remainder Theorem by checking the congruence modulo 2 and 11.\n\n5.  **Compute the set:** Since the sequence is periodic with a period of 110, the set of all possible residues is given by $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 110\\}\\}$. We can write a simple Python script to compute these 110 values and count the number of unique results.\n\n6.  **Final Code:** The Python script will iterate from $a=1$ to $110$, calculate $a^a \\pmod{22}$, store the results in a set to automatically handle uniqueness, and then print the set and its size.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the computation:\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22 : a in N}.\n    \n    The sequence s_a = a^a mod 22 is periodic. The period divides lcm(22, lambda(22)),\n    where lambda is the Carmichael function.\n    lambda(22) = lcm(lambda(2), lambda(11)) = lcm(1, 10) = 10.\n    The period is therefore a divisor of lcm(22, 10) = 110.\n\n    We can prove that for any a >= 1, (a+110)^(a+110) === a^a (mod 22).\n    (a+110)^(a+110) % 22\n    = a^(a+110) % 22  (since a+110 = a mod 22)\n    = (a^a * a^110) % 22\n\n    This equals a^a % 22 if a^a * (a^110 - 1) is a multiple of 22.\n    Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this can be shown to be true for all a >= 1.\n\n    Therefore, the set of all residues is generated by a from 1 to 110.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    residues = set()\n    # We loop from 1 to 110 to find all unique residues.\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        residue = pow(a, a, 22)\n        residues.add(residue)\n        \n    # The sorted list of unique residues.\n    sorted_residues = sorted(list(residues))\n    \n    print(f\"The set of unique residues is: {sorted_residues}\")\n    print(f\"The cardinality of the set is: {len(sorted_residues)}\")\n\nsolve_cardinality()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
