    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle in a specific interval within the 1D box.\n\n### **Plan:**\n\n1.  **State the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is:\n    ψ_n(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\n\n2.  **Define Probability Density:** The probability density, P(x), is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)\n\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** The probability of finding the particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    Probability = ∫[from x1 to x2] (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a) dx\n\n4.  **Apply Problem Specifics:**\n    *   Quantum state: `n = 2`\n    *   Interval: `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Integral:** To make the calculation independent of the box length `a`, we can perform a change of variables with `u = x/a`. This means `dx = a * du`, and the integration limits become `u1 = 0.495` and `u2 = 0.505`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    Probability = ∫[from 0.495 to 0.505] (2/a) * sin²(nπu) * (a du)\n    Probability = ∫[from 0.495 to 0.505] 2 * sin²(nπu) du\n\n6.  **Calculate Numerically:** We will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to numerically solve this definite integral for `n=2`. This is a highly accurate method for this type of problem.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a given interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the constants from the problem\n    n = 2           # Quantum state\n    u1 = 0.495      # Lower bound of the interval (as a fraction of box length a)\n    u2 = 0.505      # Upper bound of the interval (as a fraction of box length a)\n\n    # 2. Define the integrand function for the probability\n    # This corresponds to 2 * sin^2(n * pi * u)\n    def probability_density(u):\n        return 2 * (np.sin(n * np.pi * u))**2\n\n    # 3. Perform the numerical integration using scipy.integrate.quad\n    # The quad function returns the result of the integral and an estimate of the error\n    probability, error = quad(probability_density, u1, u2)\n    \n    # 4. Print the final results, showing the components of the calculation as requested\n    print(\"--- Calculation of Probability for a Particle in a 1D Box ---\")\n    print(f\"The particle is in the quantum state n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"We are finding the probability in the interval from x = {u1}*a to x = {u2}*a.\")\n    print(\"The equation for the probability is the integral of P(u) = 2 * sin^2(n*pi*u) from u1 to u2.\")\n    print(f\"P = Integral from {u1} to {u2} of 2 * sin^2({n}*pi*u) du\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n    # Note: The interval is centered on x=0.5a, which is a node for the n=2 state\n    # (where the wavefunction is zero). Therefore, the probability is expected to be very small.\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<6.579735282583856e-06>>>"
