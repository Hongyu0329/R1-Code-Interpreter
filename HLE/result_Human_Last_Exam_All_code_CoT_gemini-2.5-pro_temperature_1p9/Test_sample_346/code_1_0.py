# Step 1: The Church numeral `n` is derived from the expression.
# As explained in the plan, the expression simplifies to `succ'(2(2))`, where `succ'`
# is a successor function and `2(2)` is Church numeral exponentiation.
# succ'(0) -> 1
# succ'(1) -> 2
# 2(2) -> 4
# succ'(4) -> 5
n = 5

# Step 2: The problem asks for the base-2 logarithm of n.
base = 2

# Step 3: Calculate the logarithm.
result = math.log(n, base)

# Step 4: Output the result. The final equation is log_2(5).
