    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression**: The complex SKI expression can be simplified by recognizing its components as representations of Church numerals and operations upon them.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Combinators**:\n    *   `S(I)`: Let's call this `succ'`. When applied to a Church numeral `n`, it yields `n+1`.\n        *   `succ'(n) f x = S(I)(n) f x = f(n f x) = f(f^n(x)) = f^(n+1)(x)`.\n    *   `S(I)(I)`: This is a known representation for the Church numeral `2`.\n    *   `S(S(K(S))(K))`: This is the function composition combinator, `B`. It's used here to wrap other combinators without changing their meaning when applied to the necessary arguments, e.g., `B(n) = n`.\n    *   `K(I)`: This is a representation for the Church numeral `0`.\n        *   `0 f x = K(I) f x = I x = x = f^0(x)`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Expression Incrementally**: Let's substitute these known parts back into the main expression and evaluate from the inside out.\n\n    The original expression is:\n    `S(I) ( S(I) ( S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))) ) ( S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)) ) )`\n\n    Let's substitute our definitions:\n    *   `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` becomes `B(I)`. `B(I)` is equivalent to `I` itself. So this part is `K(I)`, which is `0`.\n    *   `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` becomes `B(2)`. `B(2)` is equivalent to `2`.\n\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    `succ'( succ'( succ'(0) ) (2) )`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Resulting Numeral**:\n    *   First, `succ'(0)` evaluates to `1`.\n    *   The expression becomes `succ'( succ'(1) (2) )`.\n    *   Next, `succ'(1)` evaluates to `2`.\n    *   The expression is now `succ'( 2(2) )`.\n    *   In Church numeral arithmetic, applying a numeral `m` to a numeral `n`, written as `m(n)`, corresponds to exponentiation `n^m`. So, `2(2)` is `2^2`, which is `4`.\n    *   The final expression is `succ'(4)`.\n    *   This evaluates to `5`.\n    *   So, the Church numeral `n` represented by the entire expression is `5`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The problem asks for `log_2(n)`. We need to calculate `log_2(5)`.\n\nThis step-by-step reduction allows us to find the value of `n` without needing to perform the full, complex combinator reduction. The final step is a simple logarithmic calculation, which we will perform using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: The Church numeral `n` is derived from the expression.\n# As explained in the plan, the expression simplifies to `succ'(2(2))`, where `succ'`\n# is a successor function and `2(2)` is Church numeral exponentiation.\n# succ'(0) -> 1\n# succ'(1) -> 2\n# 2(2) -> 4\n# succ'(4) -> 5\nn = 5\n\n# Step 2: The problem asks for the base-2 logarithm of n.\nbase = 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the logarithm.\nresult = math.log(n, base)\n\n# Step 4: Output the result. The final equation is log_2(5).\nprint(f\"The complex SKI expression represents the Church numeral n = {n}.\")\nprint(\"The final equation we need to solve is log_base(n).\")\nprint(f\"log_{base}({n}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.321928094887362>>>"
