    k1 = 0.8  # Angular size ratio from the space station (P1/P2)
    k2 = 0.2  # Angular size ratio from Planet 2 (P1/BD)

    # The problem is under-determined with the given information. We derive a relationship between
    # the radius ratio we want (R2/R_BD) and the distance ratio x = d1/d2.
    # The equations from the problem are:
    # (1) R1/d1 = k1 * R2/d2
    # (2) R1/(d2 - d1) = k2 * R_BD/d2
    #
    # Dividing (2) by (1) gives: d1 / (d2 - d1) = (k2/k1) * (R_BD/R2)
    # Rearranging for R2/R_BD: R2/R_BD = (k2/k1) * (d1 / (d2 - d1))
    # Substituting x = d1/d2: R2/R_BD = (k2/k1) * (x*d2 / (d2 - x*d2)) = (k2/k1) * x / (1-x)
    #
    # With k1=0.8 and k2=0.2, this is: R2/R_BD = (0.2/0.8) * x / (1-x) = 0.25 * x / (1-x).
    # Wait, my algebraic manipulation in thought process was d1/(d2-d1) not (d2-d1)/d1.
    # Let's re-do this small step carefully.
    # Dividing (1) by (2): (R1/d1) / (R1/(d2-d1)) = (k1*R2/d2) / (k2*R_BD/d2)
    # (d2-d1)/d1 = (k1/k2) * (R2/R_BD)
    # (d2/d1 - 1) = (k1/k2) * (R2/R_BD)
    # (1/x - 1) = (k1/k2) * (R2/R_BD)
    # (1-x)/x = (k1/k2) * (R2/R_BD)
    # R2/R_BD = (k2/k1) * (1-x)/x
    # My first derivation was correct after all. R_2/R_BD = (0.2/0.8)*(1-x)/x = (1-x)/(4x).

    # To solve this, we need a value for x. Since it's not given, we assume the simplest non-trivial
    # configuration: Planet 1 is exactly halfway between the brown dwarf and Planet 2.
    # This means d1 = d2 - d1, which simplifies to d2 = 2*d1.
    # Therefore, the distance ratio x = d1/d2 = 0.5.
    x = 0.5

    # Now we can calculate the ratio of the radii.
    ratio_k = k2 / k1

    flux_drop_fraction = r_ratio**2

    # The remaining flux is 1 minus the drop.

    # The change in magnitude is calculated using the formula: Δm = -2.5 * log10(flux_ratio)
