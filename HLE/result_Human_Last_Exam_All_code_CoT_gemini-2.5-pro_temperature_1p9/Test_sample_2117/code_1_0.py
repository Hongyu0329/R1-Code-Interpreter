    # Step 1: Define the Cayley-Menger Matrix properties
    # The Cayley-Menger matrix for a regular n-simplex with unit side length is
    # an (n+2)x(n+2) matrix A = J - I, where J is the all-ones matrix.
    # The size of the matrix is k x k where k = n + 2.
    k = n + 2
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the eigenvalues of H
    # The eigenvalues of J_k are k (multiplicity 1) and 0 (multiplicity k-1).
    # The eigenvalues of A = J_k - I_k are (k-1) and -1.
    # For A, lambda_max = k-1 = n+1, lambda_min = -1.
    # Since H is similar to A, they have the same eigenvalues.
    lambda_max_H = n + 1
    lambda_min_H = -1
    
    # The average eigenvalue gap E_M is (lambda_max - lambda_min) / (size - 1)
    E_H = (lambda_max_H - lambda_min_H) / (k - 1)
    
    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze the Gaussian Hessenberg Decomposition and find E_P
    # The "Gaussian Hessenberg Decomposition" uses similarity transformations
    # based on Gaussian elimination to reduce A to a Hessenberg matrix H.
    # The transformation matrix P is a product of inverse Gauss transform matrices.
    # For the specific matrix A = J - I, the standard procedure without pivoting
    # results in a matrix P which is unit lower triangular.
    # A unitriangular matrix has all its diagonal entries equal to 1.
    
    # The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are its diagonal entries.
    # Therefore, all eigenvalues of P are 1.
    lambda_max_P = 1.0
    lambda_min_P = 1.0
    
    # The average eigenvalue gap of P is therefore 0.
    # The denominator k-1 = n+1 is non-zero for any positive n.
    E_P = (lambda_max_P - lambda_min_P) / (k - 1)
    
    # Step 5: Determine the product
    # The product includes the term E_P. Since E_P = 0, the entire product is 0.
    # The other terms, S_P and S_H, are non-zero in general but their values are irrelevant.
    # S_M is the mean square of singular values. For any non-zero matrix M, S_M > 0.
    # P is an invertible transform matrix, so it's not the zero matrix.
    # H is similar to A, which is not the zero matrix. So S_P > 0 and S_H > 0.
    
    # For demonstration, let's compute P for n=4, k=6.
    # P would be L_1^{-1}, where L_1 is the Gauss transform to zero out A[3:,1].
    # P = I + e_3*e_2^T + e_4*e_2^T + e_5*e_2^T + e_6*e_2^T
    # This matrix is unit lower triangular, its norm is non-zero.
    
    # The product to evaluate is E_P * E_H * S_P * S_H
    # As E_P is 0, the entire expression is 0, regardless of the other terms.
    # Let's assume some arbitrary non-zero values for S_P and S_H for the sake of the formula.
    S_P = 1.5 # Arbitrary non-zero value for demonstration
    S_H = 10.0 # Arbitrary non-zero value for demonstration

    # The analysis shows the product is 0 for any positive integer n.
