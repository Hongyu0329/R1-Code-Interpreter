    "To find the closed-form expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Product:** The product starts from $n=3$. This can be expressed as the ratio of the full infinite product (starting from $n=1$) and the terms corresponding to $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n2.  **Use the Gamma Function Product Formula:** The infinite product in the numerator has a known closed form involving the Gamma function. This identity comes from factoring the term $(1 - x^k/n^k)$ using the $k$-th roots of unity and applying the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function. The general identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x^k}{n^k}\\right) = \\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega_j x)} $$\n    where $\\omega_j = e^{i 2\\pi j/k}$ are the $k$-th roots of unity.\n3.  **Apply to the Specific Case:** For this problem, we have $k=3$. The cube roots of unity are $1$, $\\omega = e^{i 2\\pi/3}$, and $\\omega^2 = e^{i 4\\pi/3}$. Applying the identity gives:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n4.  **Combine and Simplify:** Substituting this result back into the expression from step 1, we get the final formula. The denominator terms are $(1 - z^3/1^3) = 1-z^3$ and $(1 - z^3/2^3) = 1-z^3/8$.\n\nThe following Python code will construct and print the final equation based on this derivation.\n\n```python\n# This script formats and prints the final symbolic formula for the given infinite product.\n\n# The left-hand side of the equation, as given in the problem.\n# The numbers 3 and 3 are present here.\nlhs = \"Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3/n^3)\"\n\n# The denominator terms that arise from splitting the product.\n# They correspond to n=1 and n=2. We write 1^3 and 2^3 to show their origin.\nterm_n1 = \"(1 - z^3/(1^3))\"\nterm_n2 = \"(1 - z^3/(2^3))\"\n\n# The product of Gamma functions derived from the infinite product starting at n=1.\n# The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are present in this part of the expression.\ngamma_product = \"Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*2*pi/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*4*pi/3))\"\n\n# Construct the right-hand side of the equation.\nrhs = f\"1 / ({term_n1} * {term_n2} * {gamma_product})\"\n\n# Print the final equation, showing how all the numbers come together.\nprint(\"The final expression for the infinite product is:\")\nprint(f\"{lhs} = {rhs}\")\n```\n\n<<<1/((1 - z^3) * (1 - z^3/8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*2*pi/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*4*pi/3)))>>>"
