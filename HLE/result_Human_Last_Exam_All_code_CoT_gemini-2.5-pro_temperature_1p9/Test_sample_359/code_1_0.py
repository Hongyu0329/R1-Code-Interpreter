    # The problem is to find the minimum number of moves for White to force a win.
    # We must assume Black will play optimally, which means choosing the defense
    # that prolongs the game the most.

    # --- Position Analysis ---
    # FEN: 8/2k5/5pn1/1Pp1pNpp/3PP3/4K1B1/8/8 w - - 0 43
    # Winning Condition: Move the King to d4, e4, d5, or e5.
    # White's King at e3 is close to the center.
    # The winning move 1. Ke4 is currently blocked by Black's Knight on f6.

    # --- White's Key Move ---
    # White's best move is 1. d5. This forces a response from Black by attacking
    # the f6 knight.

    # --- Analyzing Black's Responses ---

    # Scenario 1 & 2: Black chooses a line that loses in 2 moves.
    # If Black plays 1... cxd5+, White wins with 2. Kxd5.
    # If Black plays 1... Ne8, White wins with 2. Ke4.
    moves_in_faster_loss = 2

    # Scenario 3: Black plays optimally to prolong the game.
    # Black can play a move like 1... h4, ignoring the threat to the knight.
    # This leads to the following sequence:
    # 1. d5 h4
    # 2. dxe6 (White captures the knight, now the e4 square is undefended)
    # 2... hxg3 (Black's move, but it cannot stop the winning plan)
    # 3. Ke4 (White moves the king to e4 and wins)
    moves_in_optimal_defense = 3

    # --- Conclusion ---
    # Since we assume optimal play, Black will choose the line of play
    # that makes the game last the longest.
    winning_moves_count = max(moves_in_faster_loss, moves_in_optimal_defense)
