    "My plan is to identify the specific character in William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" who fits the user's description. To do this, I will access my knowledge of the book's plot and characters. The key details are a visit to a Roman city and a description of a founding myth that clearly alludes to Romulus and Remus being nursed by a wolf. Once the character is identified, I will present the answer in a Python code block using a `print` statement, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character\n    from \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes Roman religious practices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In Chapter V, \"The Thrall's Tale,\" a captured Roman thrall tells a story\n    # to the Goths. He describes the founding myth of the great city of his people,\n    # where twin brethren were suckled by a she-wolf. This is a clear reference\n    # to the legend of Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome.\n    character = \"The thrall\"\n\n    print(\"The character from William Morris's 'The House of the Wolfings' who visited a Roman city and describes its founding myth (referencing Romulus and Remus) is:\")\n    print(character)\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<The thrall>>>"
