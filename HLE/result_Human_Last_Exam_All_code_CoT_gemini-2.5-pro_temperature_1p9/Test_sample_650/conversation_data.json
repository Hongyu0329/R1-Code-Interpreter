    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the computational time complexity of the given algorithm, followed by a Python script to present the result.\n\n### Complexity Analysis Plan\n\n1.  **Model of Computation**: We will analyze the algorithm's time complexity in the bit complexity model. This means that arithmetic operations (like division, multiplication) on large numbers are not constant-time operations. Their cost depends on the number of bits in the operands. Let the number of bits in `n` be `B_n ≈ log₂(n)` and in `c` be `B_c ≈ log₂(c)`.\n\n2.  **Cost of Core Operations**: The most expensive operations in the algorithm are the division `q := ⌊x/c⌋` and the subsequent multiplication and subtraction `x - qc`. The time complexity of dividing an integer `x` by `c` using standard long division is proportional to the product of their bit lengths: `O(log(x) * log(c))`.\n\n3.  **Number of Iterations**: The `while` loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The value of `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`, then `⌊n/c²⌋`, and so on. The loop runs until `n/c^i < 1`, which means it runs `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋` times. The total number of divisions performed (including the one before the loop) is `k+1`, which is approximately `log_c(n)`.\n\n4.  **Summing the Costs**: We need to sum the cost of the division `O(log(x) * log(c))` over all iterations. In each step `i` (from 0 to `k`), the value of `x` is approximately `n / c^i`.\n    The total cost `T` is the sum of costs for each division:\n    `T ≈ Σ_{i=0 to k} O(log(n/c^i) * log c)`\n    `T ≈ O(log c * Σ_{i=0 to k} log(n/c^i))`\n    `T ≈ O(log c * Σ_{i=0 to k} (log n - i * log c))`\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Sum**: The sum is an arithmetic series. We can analyze it in two main cases:\n    *   **Case 1: `n >= c`**: The number of iterations `k` is significant. The sum evaluates to `O((log n)² / log c)`. Multiplying by the `O(log c)` factor from outside the sum gives a total complexity of **`O((log n)²)`.**\n    *   **Case 2: `n < c`**: The loop does not execute at all (`q=0` initially). Only one division (`n/c`) is performed. The complexity is the cost of this single division, which is **`O(log n * log c)`.**\n\n6.  **Unified Complexity Expression**: We can combine these two cases into a single expression. The complexity is driven by the larger of the two terms, `(log n)²` and `log n * log c`. This can be written as `O((log n)² + log n * log c)` or `O(log n * max(log n, log c))`. This single expression correctly reflects the complexity for any relationship between `n` and `c`.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints the final determined complexity.\n\n```python\ndef print_complexity():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # The time complexity is derived based on the bit complexity model,\n  # considering that the cost of arithmetic operations depends on the bit length of the numbers.\n  # The formula O((log n)^2 + log n * log c) combines the complexity for\n  # different regimes of n and c (e.g., n > c and n < c).\n  complexity_formula = \"O((log n)^2 + log n * log c)\"\n  \n  print(\"The computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm is:\")\n  print(complexity_formula)\n\nprint_complexity()\n```\n<<<O((log n)^2 + log n * log c)>>>"
