# Plan:
# 1. The user wants to identify the artist behind a specific quote.
# 2. Research confirms the quote is attributed to the Russian-French artist Marc Chagall (1887-1985).
# 3. Chagall was a prominent 20th-century artist, and while Jewish, his work frequently explored Christian themes and imagery, fitting the user's description.
# 4. This script will store the artist's name and print it as the solution.
