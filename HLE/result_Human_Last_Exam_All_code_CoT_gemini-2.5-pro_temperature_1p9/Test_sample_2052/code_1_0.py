def solve_matrix_model_questions():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the theoretical questions about the superintegrability of the matrix model Z_{-n}(t).
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The property of superintegrability in these models is tied to the operators W_{-n} that generate the Tr(Phi_2^n) terms.
    2.  The fundamental or "primary" operators in the associated W-algebra are those indexed by prime numbers.
    3.  For n=3 (a prime number), the model Z_{-3} is generated by a fundamental operator W_{-3}. Such models are known to be superintegrable.
    4.  For n=4 (a composite number), the operator W_{-4} is not fundamental. It can be constructed from the operator W_{-2} corresponding to the prime factor of 4.
       Therefore, a new, independent operator W_{-4} is not necessary to generate Z_{-4}.
