    print("Let <x_alpha : alpha < delta> be the tower.")
    print("1. Each x_alpha is an uncountable subset of omega_1.")
    print("2. For alpha < beta < delta, |x_beta \\ x_alpha| is countable.")
    print("   This means the sets are 'almost decreasing'.")
    print("3. There is no uncountable y such that for all alpha, |y \\ x_alpha| is countable.")
    print("   This means the sequence has no 'almost subset' as a lower bound.\n")

    print("by construction, 'almost contained' in every x_n.")
    print("But the existence of such a y contradicts condition (3) of the tower definition.")
    print("Therefore, the length of the tower, delta, cannot be a countable ordinal.\n")

    print("Step 3: Can delta be omega_1?")
    print("Since delta must be uncountable, the smallest possible candidate is omega_1.")
    print("We need to show that a tower of length omega_1 can be constructed.")

    print("1. Is x_beta uncountable? Yes, it's a union of omega_1 stationary sets, so it's uncountable.")
    
    print("2. For alpha < beta, is |x_beta \\ x_alpha| countable? ")
    print("   x_beta is a subset of x_alpha, so x_beta \\ x_alpha is the empty set, which is countable. This condition holds.")

    print("3. Is there an uncountable lower bound y? Let's assume one exists.")
    print("   This would mean |y \\ x_beta| is countable for all beta < omega_1.")
    print("   y \\ x_beta = y INTERSECTION (UNION(S_gamma for gamma < beta)).")
    print("   If this holds for all beta, it implies that |y INTERSECTION S_gamma| must be countable for all gamma < omega_1.")
    print("   But y is an uncountable subset of omega_1 = UNION(S_gamma).")
    print("   A fundamental property is that an uncountable set cannot be expressed as a union of countably many countable sets. More strongly, if an uncountable set y is written as a union of omega_1 sets, at least one of those intersections (y INTERSECTION S_gamma) must be uncountable.")
    print("   This leads to a contradiction. So, no such lower bound y exists.\n")

    print("Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("We have shown that delta cannot be countable, but it can be omega_1.")
    print("Therefore, the minimal possible value for delta is omega_1.")
