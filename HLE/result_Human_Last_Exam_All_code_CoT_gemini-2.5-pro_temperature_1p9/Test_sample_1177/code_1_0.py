# The problem presents a legal scenario and asks for the correct analysis regarding the transfer of risk of loss.
# The solution requires applying principles from the Sale of Goods Act.

# Facts:
# 1. Contract for a specific MacBook Pro.
# 2. Condition: Jake (seller) must repair the screen. The goods are not yet in a "deliverable state".
# 3. Luke (buyer) pays the full price of $1000.
# 4. Jake finishes the repair, putting the goods in a deliverable state.
# 5. Jake notifies Luke on June 5 that the laptop is ready for pickup on June 6.
# 6. The laptop is destroyed by a flood on the night of June 5/6, after the repair and notification, but before Luke takes physical possession.

# Legal Principle (from Sale of Goods Act, Rule 2 regarding transfer of property/risk):
# For a contract for specific goods where the seller must do something to put them in a deliverable state,
# the property (and thus risk) passes to the buyer only after:
#   a) The seller has completed the required action (the repair).
#   b) The buyer has been notified that the action is complete.

# Analysis:
# - Jake completed the repair. Condition (a) is met.
# - Jake notified Luke that the laptop was ready. Condition (b) is met.
# - The transfer of risk occurred on June 5, upon notification.
# - The flood happened after the risk had transferred to Luke.
# - Therefore, the loss falls on Luke, and Jake is not required to refund the money.

# Evaluating the choices:
# A: Incorrect. Insurance is irrelevant to determining who bears the legal risk between buyer and seller.
# B: Correct. This choice accurately describes that risk passed when Jake completed the repairs (put the item in a deliverable state) and notified Luke.
# C: Incorrect. The notice via text was appropriate and acknowledged.
# D: Incorrect. Risk passes with property, not necessarily with physical possession.
# E: Incorrect. The goods were explicitly not in a deliverable state on June 2.

final_answer = 'B'

print(f"The correct option is B because it aligns with the rules for the passing of risk in a sale of goods contract.")
print(f"The rule states that for specific goods that the seller must put into a deliverable state, the risk of loss passes to the buyer once the seller has completed the work AND notified the buyer.")
print(f"In this case, Jake completed the screen replacement and notified Luke on June 5th that the laptop would be ready on June 6th.")
print(f"At the moment of that notification, the risk of loss transferred to Luke. The subsequent destruction of the laptop, therefore, is Luke's loss, not Jake's.")
