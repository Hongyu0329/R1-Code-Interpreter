    ### Analysis of the Question

    The question refers to ECDSA as being "existentially forgeable". This is non-standard terminology, as ECDSA is designed to be existentially *un*forgeable, which is a key security feature. The most likely interpretation is that the question is highlighting ECDSA's **malleability**. Malleability means that given one valid signature for a message, a different but still valid signature for the *same* message can be easily created. This property means ECDSA is not "strongly unforgeable," but it doesn't break its core security against forging signatures for new messages.

    With this context, we analyze the choices:

    ### Evaluation of Answer Choices

    **A. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.**
    *   **Result: False.**
    *   Reason: Due to ECDSA's malleability, if `sig = (r, s)` is a signature, then `sig' = (r, -s mod n)` is also a valid signature for the same message. This is computationally trivial, so the probability of success is essentially 1 (non-negligible).

    **B. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.**
    *   **Result: True.**
    *   Reason: This is the primary security assumption of ECDSA. The security relies on the computational difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). If an adversary could recover the secret key from public information, the signature scheme would be completely broken. This is designed to be infeasible.

    **C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.**
    *   **Result: Not the best answer.**
    *   Reason: This describes a universal forgery attack. Secure schemes like ECDSA are specifically designed to prevent this. The malleability property does not create a vulnerability to universal forgery.

    **D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.**
    *   **Result: False.**
    *   Reason: The claim "for all" is too strong. While ECDSA uses a hash function that makes recovering the message `m` from the signature infeasible, some signature schemes (like textbook RSA without hashing) do allow the message to be recovered directly from the signature. Such a scheme can also be existentially forged, providing a counterexample.
