    The reaction is a two-step process involving nucleophiles and a base.
    - Reactants: 'tert-butyl hydrazine' (a nucleophile), 'benzylamine' (a nucleophile), and 'DIPEA' (a non-nucleophilic base).
    - The base (DIPEA) suggests that an acidic byproduct (like H-Cl or H-Br) is generated, which is characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction where a leaving group on an aromatic ring is displaced.

    The key is to find a structure that fits both the reaction and the spectra.
    - The ¹H NMR shows two uncoupled aromatic protons (singlets at 8.24 and 8.11 ppm). In a simple 6-membered ring like pyrimidine, this suggests a para-like arrangement (e.g., at positions 2 and 5, or 4 and 6).
    - The reaction scheme strongly suggests Compound A is a di-halogenated pyrimidine.
    - The most plausible candidate for the final product's core is a 2,5-disubstituted pyrimidine. This would place the remaining protons at H-4 and H-6, which are para to each other and would appear as two singlets with similar chemical shifts, matching the spectrum.
    - However, a pyrimidine ring has only 4 carbon atoms. The ¹³C NMR analysis clearly indicates 5 carbon atoms in the core structure. This is a direct contradiction.
    - This type of data inconsistency suggests a likely error in the provided ¹³C NMR peak list. Prioritizing the clear reaction scheme and the highly characteristic ¹H NMR data is the most logical path forward.
    - Assuming the ¹H NMR and reaction scheme are correct, the product is 'N-benzyl-2-(2-(tert-butyl)hydrazinyl)pyrimidin-5-amine'.
