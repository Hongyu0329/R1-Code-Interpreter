    Solves a theoretical problem about the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and tensor products.

    The problem states:
    Let k be a positive integer and let G and H be graphs that are indistinguishable by the
    k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm (G ≡k H), but that are distinguishable by the
    k+1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm (G ≢k+1 H).

    What is the maximum ℓ such that G^ℓ and H^ℓ are indistinguishable by the
    k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm? Here G^ℓ is the ℓ-fold Tensor product.
