    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship:** The problem asks for the 8-point DFT of a sequence `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. This is an interleaved sequence. The DFT of such a sequence can be efficiently calculated using the DFTs of the original sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. This method is the core idea behind the Decimation-In-Time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\n2.  **Formulate the equation:** The 8-point DFT, `Y(k)`, can be expressed in terms of the given 4-point DFTs, `X(k)` and `H(k)`, using the following formula for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n    Here, `X(k mod 4)` and `H(k mod 4)` are the periodically extended versions of the given 4-point DFTs, and `W_8^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 8)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n3.  **Execute the calculation:** I will write a Python script to compute `Y(k)` for each `k` from 0 to 7. The script will:\n    *   Define the input DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n    *   Iterate from `k = 0` to `7`.\n    *   In each step, calculate the result using the formula above.\n    *   Print out each step of the calculation, showing the specific values from `X(k)`, `H(k)`, the twiddle factor `W_8^k`, and the final value for `Y(k)`. This fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    *   Finally, it will print the complete 8-point DFT `Y(k)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the DFT:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 8-point DFT of an interleaved sequence y(n) = {x(0),h(0),...,x(3),h(3)}\n    given the 4-point DFTs X(k) and H(k).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X_k = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\n    H_k = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j])\n\n    print(\"Given 4-point DFTs:\")\n    print(f\"X(k) = {X_k}\")\n    print(f\"H(k) = {H_k}\\n\")\n    print(\"The 8-point DFT Y(k) of the interleaved sequence is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4), where W_8^k = exp(-j*2*pi*k/8)\\n\")\n    \n    # To store the results\n    Y_k = np.zeros(8, dtype=np.complex128)\n\n    print(\"--- Calculation for each k ---\")\n    for k in range(8):\n        x_val = X_k[k % 4]\n        h_val = H_k[k % 4]\n        twiddle_factor = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k / 8)\n        y_val = x_val + twiddle_factor * h_val\n        Y_k[k] = y_val\n\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = X({k % 4}) + W_8^{k} * H({k % 4})\")\n        print(f\"   = {x_val} + ({twiddle_factor.real:.4f}{twiddle_factor.imag:+.4f}j) * {h_val}\")\n        print(f\"   = ({y_val.real:.4f}{y_val.imag:+.4f}j)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final 8-point DFT Result ---\")\n    print(\"Y(k) = [\")\n    for val in Y_k:\n        print(f\"  ({val.real:.4f}{val.imag:+.4f}j),\")\n    print(\"]\")\n\n\nsolve_dft()\n\n# Constructing the answer string based on the calculation.\nfinal_answer = [\n    (1.0000+0.0000j),\n    (1.4142+1.0000j),\n    (-1.0000-1.0000j),\n    (-1.4142-1.0000j),\n    (1.0000-0.0000j),\n    (-1.4142+1.0000j),\n    (-1.0000+1.0000j),\n    (1.4142-1.0000j)\n]\nfinal_answer_str = str(final_answer).replace('j', 'j, ').replace('),', ');').replace('[', '{').replace(']', '}')\n\n# This part is for the final required format, it won't be executed by the user.\n# The code above is what the user should execute.\n# print(f\"<<<{final_answer_str}>>>\")\n```\n<<<Y(k) = [ (1.0000+0.0000j), (1.4142+1.0000j), (-1.0000-1.0000j), (-1.4142-1.0000j), (1.0000+0.0000j), (-1.4142+1.0000j), (-1.0000+1.0000j), (1.4142-1.0000j) ]>>>"
