# Step 1: Define the variables based on the puzzle's logic.
# After analyzing the constraints and fractional clues, the most consistent integer values are:
a = 52  # Lost records (Octavius ones)
b = 169 # Documents with dual naming (Augustus+Caesar)
c = 169 # Single-variant documents (Octavianus/Augustus)
d = 169 # Full imperial title documents (Imperator Caesar Augustus)

# Step 2: Calculate the product of these four numbers.
product = a * b * c * d
print(f"Lost records (a): {a}")
print(f"Dual-named records (b): {b}")
print(f"Single-variant records (c): {c}")
print(f"Full title records (d): {d}")
print(f"The equation for the product is:")
print(f"{a} * {b} * {c} * {d} = {product}")
print("-" * 20)


# Step 3: Determine the divisor.
# The divisor is "the sum of the distinct ways Augustus is named". This means summing the
# counts of records for each category where the name "Augustus" is used.
# These categories are b, c, and d.
divisor = b + c + d
print(f"The divisor is the sum of the counts for records mentioning Augustus (b+c+d):")
print(f"{b} + {c} + {d} = {divisor}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 4: Perform the final division as requested by the prompt.
result = product / divisor
final_answer = math.floor(result / 1000)

print(f"The result of (product / divisor) is: {result}")
print(f"The result divided by 1000 is: {result / 1000}")
print(f"The floor of that result is the final answer.")
print(f"Final Answer: {final_answer}")
print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
