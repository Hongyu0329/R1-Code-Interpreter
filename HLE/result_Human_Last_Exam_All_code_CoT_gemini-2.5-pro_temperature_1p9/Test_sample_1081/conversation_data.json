    "The problem asks for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n1.  **Tori and the Weyl Group**: A fundamental result in the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields, established by T. A. Springer and R. Steinberg, states that the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the Frobenius-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n2.  **Split Groups**: For a split group $G$ (which is the standard assumption unless specified otherwise), the action of the Frobenius endomorphism on the Weyl group is trivial. In this case, the Frobenius-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n\n3.  **The Weyl Group of type E_8**: The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. Its corresponding Weyl group is denoted as $W(E_8)$. Therefore, the task reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the group $W(E_8)$.\n\n4.  **Number of Conjugacy Classes**: The number of conjugacy classes for the Weyl groups of exceptional Lie types are well-known mathematical constants. For $W(E_8)$, this number has been calculated to be 112. This result is independent of the size $q$ of the finite field, as long as the group is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112. The following Python code will print this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a\n    reductive group G of type E_8 over the finite field F_q.\n    \n    The number of F_q-rational maximal tori (up to F_q-conjugacy) in a split\n    reductive group is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group.\n    For a group of type E_8, the Weyl group is W(E_8).\n    \n    The number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E_8) is a known\n    mathematical fact, which is 112.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E_8).\n    num_tori = 112\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E_8).\")\n    print(f\"Number of rational maximal tori = Number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) = {num_tori}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<112>>>"
