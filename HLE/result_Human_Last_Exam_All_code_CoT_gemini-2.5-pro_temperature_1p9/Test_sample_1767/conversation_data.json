    "The Chern number is a topological invariant that quantifies the transverse Hall conductance of a 2D material. For systems that are combined, the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers, assuming they are weakly coupled. When two Chern insulators are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger system.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define variables for the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators, `C1` and `C2`.\n2.  Calculate the total Chern number, `C_total`, of the combined system by summing the individual Chern numbers (`C_total = C1 + C2`).\n3.  Print the equation and the final result, showing each number involved in the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The Chern numbers for the two individual insulators.\nC1 = 1\nC2 = 1\n\n# When two Chern insulators are joined, the Chern number of the resulting\n# junction is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Display the calculation and the final answer.\nprint(f\"The total Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {C1} + {C2}\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {C_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
