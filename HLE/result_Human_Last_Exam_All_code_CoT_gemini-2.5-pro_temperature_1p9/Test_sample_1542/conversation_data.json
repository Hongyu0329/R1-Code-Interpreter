    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent the Mathematical Objects:**\n    *   A quadratic form `Q(x, y) = ax² + bxy + cy²` over the ring R = Z/8Z can be uniquely identified by its tuple of coefficients `(a, b, c)`, where `a, b, c` are integers from 0 to 7.\n    *   An invertible linear transform is represented by a 2x2 matrix `P` with entries in R. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is a unit in R. The units in Z/8Z are {1, 3, 5, 7}.\n\n2.  **Define Equivalence:**\n    *   Two quadratic forms, `Q₁` and `Q₂`, are equivalent if `Q₂(v) = Q₁(P(v))` for some invertible matrix `P`.\n    *   We can write a function that takes a form `(a, b, c)` and a matrix `P` and computes the coefficients of the new, transformed quadratic form.\n\n3.  **Algorithm for Counting Classes:**\n    *   The set of all forms is partitioned into disjoint equivalence classes (orbits). Our goal is to count these partitions.\n    *   We will use a computational approach to find these classes:\n        a. Generate a set of all 8³ = 512 possible quadratic forms.\n        b. Generate a list of all invertible 2x2 matrices over Z/8Z.\n        c. Maintain a set of forms that have not yet been classified.\n        d. While this set is not empty, we:\n            i.   Pick a form from the set. This becomes the representative of a new class.\n            ii.  Increment our class counter.\n            iii. Systematically find all other forms equivalent to this one by applying every invertible matrix. This collection is the \"orbit\" of the representative form.\n            iv.  Remove all forms in the discovered orbit from our set of unclassified forms.\n    *   The final value of the counter is the number of equivalence classes.\n\nThis method guarantees that we count each class exactly once. Now, here is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the finite ring R=Z/8Z.\n\n    The code implements the following steps:\n    1.  It defines the ring Z/8Z and identifies its units.\n    2.  It generates all possible quadratic forms, represented by tuples (a, b, c).\n    3.  It generates all invertible 2x2 matrices over the ring.\n    4.  It defines the transformation rule for a quadratic form under a change of basis.\n    5.  It iterates through all forms, classifying them into equivalence classes (orbits)\n        and counts the number of such classes.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n    # In Z/8Z, the units are numbers coprime to 8.\n    UNITS = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\n    # Step 1: Generate a list of all invertible 2x2 matrices over Z/8Z.\n    # A matrix is invertible if its determinant is a unit in the ring.\n    invertible_matrices = []\n    for p11 in range(N):\n        for p12 in range(N):\n            for p21 in range(N):\n                for p22 in range(N):\n                    determinant = (p11 * p22 - p12 * p21) % N\n                    if determinant in UNITS:\n                        invertible_matrices.append(((p11, p12), (p21, p22)))\n\n    # Step 2: Generate the set of all 512 possible quadratic forms (a, b, c).\n    all_forms = set()\n    for a in range(N):\n        for b in range(N):\n            for c in range(N):\n                all_forms.add((a, b, c))\n\n    # Step 3: Define the transformation on a quadratic form.\n    # If Q(x,y) = ax^2+bxy+cy^2 and v' = Pv, the new form Q'(v) is Q(v').\n    # We calculate the coefficients (a', b', c') of Q'.\n    def transform(form, matrix):\n        a, b, c = form\n        (p11, p12), (p21, p22) = matrix\n\n        # New coefficients are derived by substituting x -> p11*x+p12*y\n        # and y -> p21*x+p22*y into Q(x,y) and collecting terms.\n        a_new = (a * p11**2 + b * p11 * p21 + c * p21**2) % N\n        b_new = (2 * a * p11 * p12 + b * (p11 * p22 + p12 * p21) + 2 * c * p21 * p22) % N\n        c_new = (a * p12**2 + b * p12 * p22 + c * p22**2) % N\n        return (a_new, b_new, c_new)\n\n    # Step 4: Use a standard algorithm to count the orbits (equivalence classes).\n    num_classes = 0\n    unclassified_forms = all_forms.copy()\n\n    while unclassified_forms:\n        # A new class is found.\n        num_classes += 1\n\n        # Pick an arbitrary form to be the representative of this new class.\n        representative = unclassified_forms.pop()\n\n        # Find the entire orbit of this representative using a breadth-first search.\n        orbit = {representative}\n        queue = collections.deque([representative])\n\n        while queue:\n            current_form = queue.popleft()\n            for matrix in invertible_matrices:\n                new_form = transform(current_form, matrix)\n                if new_form not in orbit:\n                    orbit.add(new_form)\n                    queue.append(new_form)\n        \n        # Remove all forms in this orbit from the set of unclassified forms.\n        unclassified_forms -= orbit\n\n    # Final Answer\n    print(\"Over the finite ring R=Z/8Z, the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables is:\")\n    print(num_classes)\n\n# Execute the code to find and print the solution.\nsolve_quadratic_form_classes()\n<<<20>>>\n```"
