    "To determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish the timeline:** I will find the start and end years of the conflict based on established StarCraft lore. The war began in the year 2504 and concluded in 2508.\n2.  **Calculate the duration:** I will subtract the start year from the end year to find the total duration.\n3.  **Round up:** As requested, I will round the result up to the nearest whole year.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** I will create a Python script that performs this calculation and prints the equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War started in 2504 and ended in 2508.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# Round the duration up to the nearest whole number\nyears_rounded_up = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print the equation with each number\nprint(f\"Calculation: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The Second Great War in StarCraft Lore lasted for {years_rounded_up} years (rounded up).\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
