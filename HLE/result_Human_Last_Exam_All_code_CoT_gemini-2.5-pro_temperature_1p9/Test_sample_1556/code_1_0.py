    Solves for |α|² based on the properties of the quantum circuit B.

    The core logic is as follows:
    1. Let p = |α|². Since |α|² + |β|² = 1, we have |β|² = 1 - p.
    2. The problem states that B is its own inverse (B² = I). This means if B maps state |ψ⟩ to |ψ'⟩, it also maps |ψ'⟩ back to |ψ⟩.
    3. Property 1 says that for any state produced by the circuit B, the probability of measuring |1⟩ is the square of the probability of measuring |0⟩.
    4. This property must apply to the state |ψ⟩ itself, as it's the output of applying B to |ψ'⟩.
    5. Therefore, the probabilities in |ψ⟩ must satisfy the relation: |β|² = (|α|²)².
    6. Substituting our definitions from step 1 gives the equation: 1 - p = p².
    7. Rearranging this gives the quadratic equation: p² + p - 1 = 0.
    8. We solve this equation for p, which represents |α|².
