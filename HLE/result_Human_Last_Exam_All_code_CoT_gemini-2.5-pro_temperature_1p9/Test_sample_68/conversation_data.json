    "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number of colors, let's call it `n`, that can be used to color the figure-eight knot according to the rules of Fox n-coloring. This number `n` will be the size of the smallest algebraic structure required.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand Knot Coloring:** We'll model the knot coloring problem using a system of linear equations. For a knot diagram, we assign an integer \"color\" from the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` to each arc. At every crossing, if `z` is the color of the over-arc, and `x` and `y` are the colors of the two under-arcs, they must satisfy the equation `2*z â‰¡ x + y` (modulo `n`).\n\n2.  **Model the Figure-Eight Knot:** The figure-eight knot has 4 arcs and 4 crossings. We will label the arcs and write down the coloring equation for each crossing. This results in a system of 4 linear equations.\n\n3.  **Use the Knot Determinant:** A key result from knot theory states that a knot has a non-trivial n-coloring (one where not all arcs have the same color) if and only if `n` divides a specific number associated with the knot, called the knot determinant. The knot determinant is calculated from the matrix of coefficients of our system of equations.\n\n4.  **Find the Smallest 'n':** The smallest possible value for `n` (where `n > 1`) gives the size of the smallest algebraic structure. This will be the smallest factor (greater than 1) of the knot determinant.\n\n5.  **Code the Solution:** We will write a Python script to:\n    *   Define the coefficient matrix for the figure-eight knot's coloring equations.\n    *   Calculate the knot determinant from this matrix.\n    *   Find the smallest factor of the determinant to get our answer.\n    *   As a bonus, demonstrate a valid coloring by showing one of the crossing equations with actual color values.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_smallest_factor(n):\n    \"\"\"Find the smallest integer factor of n greater than 1.\"\"\"\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of n\n    # Start checking from 2.\n    if n < 2:\n        return None\n    for i in range(2, int(np.sqrt(n)) + 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n    # If no smaller factor is found, n must be prime\n    return n\n\ndef solve_figure_eight_knot_coloring():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the smallest algebraic structure that allows\n    coloring the figure-eight knot.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the system of equations for the figure-eight knot.\")\n    print(\"Let the four arcs be colored a, b, c, and d.
