# The number of faces in the standard triangulation of the Möbius band.
num_faces = 6

# The problem asks for the number of "higher dimensional rooted forests" (F, R)
# that fail to have F simplicially collapse onto R.
# Our interpretation is that:
# 1. A "forest" F is a subcomplex generated by any non-empty subset of the 6 faces.
# 2. The "root set" R is the boundary of F.
# 3. A collapse F -> R is impossible if the relative homology H_k(F, R) is non-trivial for any k.
# For any non-empty 2D surface F with boundary R=∂F, the relative homology group H_2(F, R)
# is always non-trivial.
# Therefore, EVERY such forest fails to collapse onto its root boundary.
# The problem then becomes counting the number of these forests.
# This is the number of non-empty subsets of the 6 faces.

# The total number of subsets of a set with num_faces elements is 2**num_faces.
# We subtract 1 to exclude the empty set.
number_of_non_collapsing_forests = 2**num_faces - 1

# Final equation representation
