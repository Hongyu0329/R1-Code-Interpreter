    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a few steps:\n1.  **Identify the specific \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\"**. While there are many possible triangulations, a commonly cited minimal and standard one consists of 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces (2-simplices). This structure can be created by triangulating a rectangular strip of paper and then identifying the ends with a half-twist. Let's assume this standard triangulation is the one with 6 faces. Let $N=6$ be the number of faces.\n\n2.  **Interpret the technical terms**: The main challenge is to understand what a \"higher dimensional rooted forest $(F,R)$\" means in this context, and what it means for it to \"fail to simplicially collapse\".\n    *   A **higher dimensional forest $F$**: In this context, it is reasonable to assume that a \"forest\" refers to a 2-dimensional subcomplex of the Möbius band triangulation ($K$) that is generated by a collection of its faces. We will consider all non-empty subsets of the 6 faces of $K$. Each subset generates a subcomplex $F$.\n    *   A **root set $R$**: The \"root\" of such a forest $F$ is most naturally interpreted as its boundary, which we denote $\\partial F$. The pair $(F,R)$ is thus $(F, \\partial F)$.\n    *   **Simplicial collapse failure**: A simplicial complex $F$ can be simplicially collapsed onto a subcomplex $R$ (written $F \\searrow R$) only if all relative homology groups $H_k(F,R)$ are trivial. If any of these groups are non-trivial, it serves as an obstruction to collapse. Thus, \"failing to collapse\" means that $H_k(F,R) \\neq 0$ for at least one dimension $k$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the collapse condition for our interpretation**: We need to determine for which face-generated subcomplexes $F$ does the pair $(F, \\partial F)$ have a non-trivial relative homology group.\n    *   Any non-empty subcomplex $F$ generated by a set of faces of the triangulation is a compact 2-dimensional surface with a boundary. It might be connected or disconnected, orientable or non-orientable.\n    *   A key theorem in algebraic topology states that for any non-empty compact 2-surface $S$ with boundary $\\partial S$, the second relative homology group $H_2(S, \\partial S)$ is non-trivial. Specifically, for each connected component of $S$, this group has a generator (the \"fundamental class\"), which is a copy of $\\mathbb{Z}$ if the component is orientable, or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ if it is non-orientable.\n    *   Therefore, for any non-empty subcomplex $F$ we consider, $H_2(F, \\partial F)$ is never the trivial group. This non-trivial homology group obstructs any potential simplicial collapse from $F$ to $\\partial F$.\n\n4.  **Count the number of such forests**: Based on the analysis, every \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" (interpreted as $(F, \\partial F)$ for a non-empty face-generated subcomplex $F$) fails to collapse onto its root. So, the task reduces to counting how many such objects exist. This is equivalent to counting all non-empty subsets of the set of 6 faces of the standard triangulation.\n\nThe number of subsets of a set of size $N$ is $2^N$. Since we are considering non-empty subsets, we subtract 1 for the empty set. With $N=6$ faces, the total number is $2^6 - 1$. The code below calculates this value.\n\n```python\n# The number of faces in the standard triangulation of the Möbius band.\nnum_faces = 6\n\n# The problem asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" (F, R)\n# that fail to have F simplicially collapse onto R.\n# Our interpretation is that:\n# 1. A \"forest\" F is a subcomplex generated by any non-empty subset of the 6 faces.\n# 2. The \"root set\" R is the boundary of F.\n# 3. A collapse F -> R is impossible if the relative homology H_k(F, R) is non-trivial for any k.\n# For any non-empty 2D surface F with boundary R=∂F, the relative homology group H_2(F, R)\n# is always non-trivial.\n# Therefore, EVERY such forest fails to collapse onto its root boundary.\n# The problem then becomes counting the number of these forests.\n# This is the number of non-empty subsets of the 6 faces.\n\n# The total number of subsets of a set with num_faces elements is 2**num_faces.\n# We subtract 1 to exclude the empty set.\nnumber_of_non_collapsing_forests = 2**num_faces - 1\n\n# Final equation representation\npart1 = 2\npart2 = num_faces\npart3 = 1\nresult = number_of_non_collapsing_forests\n\nprint(f\"{part1} ** {part2} - {part3} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<63>>>"
