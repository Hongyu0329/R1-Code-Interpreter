# The answers to the questions are determined using theorems from group cohomology
# and geometric group theory. The code below prints these derived answers.

# (1) What is the cohomological dimension of H?
# A group has finite cohomological dimension iff it is torsion-free.
# H has elements of order 2, so cd(H) is infinite.
ans1 = 'infty'

# (2) What is the cohomological dimension of G?
# G = H*H also has elements of order 2, so cd(G) is infinite.
ans2 = 'infty'

# (3) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of H?
# H contains a subgroup isomorphic to Z of index 2. cd(Z)=1. So vcd(H)=1.
ans3 = 1

# (4) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of G?
# G is a free product of two virtually free groups, so it is virtually free. vcd(G)=1.
ans4 = 1

# (5) How many ends does H have?
# A group has 2 ends iff it is virtually Z. So H has 2 ends.
ans5 = 2

# (6) How many ends does G have?
# The free product of two infinite groups has infinitely many ends.
ans6 = 'infty'

# (7) What is the cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
# cd_p(P) = cd_p(G) = vcd(G) = 1, since G has no p-torsion (p is odd).
ans7 = 1

# (8) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
# For a pro-p group P with finite dimension, vcd_p(P) = cd_p(P). So it is 1.
ans8 = 1

# (9) What is the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G,F_p)?
# H^1(G,F_p) is Hom(G^ab, F_p). G^ab is a 2-group. For odd p, this means
# the only homomorphism is trivial. The dimension is 0.
ans9 = 0
