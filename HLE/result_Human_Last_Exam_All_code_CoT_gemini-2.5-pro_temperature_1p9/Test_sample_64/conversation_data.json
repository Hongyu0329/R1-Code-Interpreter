    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its reading:** The word is 「弟」, and its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n2.  **Count the morae:** The reading 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to) consists of four morae.\n3.  **Find the accent kernel position:** According to standard Japanese dictionaries, the pitch accent for 「弟」 is [3]. This means the pitch rises after the first mora and falls after the third mora. The pattern is L-H-H-L (おとうと).\n4.  **Classify the pattern:**\n    *   **Heiban (平板) [0]:** No drop in pitch (L-H-H-H...).\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高) [1]:** Pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second (H-L-L-L...).\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高):** Pitch drops somewhere in the middle of the word. For a 4-mora word, this would be an accent at [2] or [3].\n    *   **Odaka (尾高):** Pitch is high on the final mora and drops on the following particle (e.g., L-H-H-H followed by a low particle). This corresponds to an accent kernel at [4] for a 4-mora word.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the word has 4 morae and the accent kernel is at position [3], it falls into the **Nakadaka** category.\n\nI will now write a Python script to automate and display this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_pitch_accent(word, reading, morae_count, accent_kernel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the Japanese pitch accent pattern type based on word properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define accent pattern rules based on morae count and kernel position\n    if accent_kernel == 0:\n        pattern_name = \"Heiban\"\n    elif accent_kernel == 1:\n        pattern_name = \"Atamadaka\"\n    elif accent_kernel == morae_count:\n        pattern_name = \"Odaka\"\n    elif 1 < accent_kernel < morae_count:\n        pattern_name = \"Nakadaka\"\n    else:\n        pattern_name = \"Unknown\"\n        \n    # --- Explanation ---\n    print(f\"Analyzing the pitch accent for the word: 「{word}」 ({reading})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"1. The word has {morae_count} morae (o-to-u-to).\")\n    print(f\"2. The standard accent kernel position is [{accent_kernel}].\")\n    print(\"3. This means the pitch rises after the first mora and falls after the third.\")\n    print(\"   Pitch visualization: Low-High-High-Low (おとうと)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Classifying the pattern:\")\n    print(f\" - For a {morae_count}-mora word, an accent at [1] would be Atamadaka.\")\n    print(f\" - An accent at [{morae_count-1}] or earlier (but not [1]) is Nakadaka.\")\n    print(f\" - An accent at [{morae_count}] would be Odaka.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # --- Final Conclusion ---\n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Word morae = {morae_count}, Accent kernel = {accent_kernel} => The pattern is {pattern_name}.\")\n    \n    return pattern_name\n\n# Word information for 「弟」\nword_kanji = \"弟\"\nword_reading = \"おとうと\"\nword_morae_count = 4\nword_accent_kernel = 3 # Accent on the 3rd mora (とう)\n\n# Run the analysis\nfind_pitch_accent(word_kanji, word_reading, word_morae_count, word_accent_kernel)\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
