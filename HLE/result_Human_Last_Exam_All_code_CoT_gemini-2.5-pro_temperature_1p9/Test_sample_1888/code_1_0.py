# Based on the analysis of the set-theoretic problem:
# delta is the cardinality of the set of possible values for the continuum.
# This was determined to be aleph_2. We represent it by its index.
delta_index = 2

# gamma is the cofinality of the continuum.
# This was determined to be aleph_1. We represent it by its index.
