    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve for the total welfare:\n\n1.  **Model the Equations:** First, I will represent the supply `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions in a way the computer can understand.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** The market equilibrium occurs where the supply price equals the demand price. I will set the two equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity (Q_E). Since this equation is too complex to solve by hand, I will use a numerical solver. After finding Q_E, I will calculate the corresponding equilibrium price (P_E).\n3.  **Calculate Consumer and Producer Surplus:**\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This represents the benefit to consumers. It is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price line (P_E). I will calculate this by integrating the demand function from 0 to Q_E and then subtracting the revenue rectangle (P_E * Q_E).\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This represents the benefit to producers. It's the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price line. I'll calculate this by taking the revenue rectangle (P_E * Q_E) and subtracting the area under the supply curve. Note that the supply curve is only defined for quantities where `Q > 2^(1/3)`, so this will be the starting point for its integration.\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of the consumer and producer surpluses. I will add the two calculated values to get the final answer and print the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
