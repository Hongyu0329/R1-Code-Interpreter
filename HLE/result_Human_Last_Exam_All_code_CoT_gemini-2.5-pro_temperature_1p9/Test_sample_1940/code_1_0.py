# The problem is to find the minimal number of Controlled-Controlled-Z (CCZ) gates
# required to exactly synthesize a Controlled-Controlled-Controlled-Z (CCCZ) gate.
# The allowed operations are CCZ gates and arbitrary single-qubit rotations,
# with the constraint of not using any ancilla qubits.

    # Step 1: Establish the equivalence of the CCZ/CCCZ problem to the CCX/CCCX problem.
    # The CCZ gate and the Toffoli (CCX) gate are "locally equivalent". This means
    # one can be converted into the other by applying only single-qubit gates.
    # Specifically, CCX(c1, c2, t) = H(t) * CCZ(c1, c2, t) * H(t), where H is the Hadamard gate.
    # Since arbitrary single-qubit rotations are allowed (which includes H), the resources
    # are equivalent. Therefore, the minimal number of CCZ gates to make a CCCZ gate is the
    # same as the minimal number of CCX gates to make a CCCX gate (a 3-controlled NOT).

    # Step 2: State the known result from the literature for the equivalent problem.
    # The problem of synthesizing a CCCX gate from CCX gates without ancillas is a
    # standard benchmark in the field. It has been shown that a minimum of 8 CCX gates
    # are required. This is an optimal result based on exhaustive search and constructive proofs.

    # Step 3: Conclude the minimal number of gates.
    minimal_gate_count = 8

    # The final result can be expressed as an equation:
    # N_min = 8
    # We will now print this result and its components as requested.
