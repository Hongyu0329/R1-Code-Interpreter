    "Of course. Here is my plan to address your request.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Terminology**: First, I will identify the specific name used in the nuclear criticality and reactor physics community for the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function. This function is fundamental to neutron noise analysis techniques.\n2.  **Explain the Concept**: I will provide a brief explanation of what this function represents and why it is important. It is the frequency-domain counterpart to time-domain correlation techniques like Rossi-alpha measurements.\n3.  **Provide a Representative Equation**: This quantity is not a single number but a function of frequency (ω) and wavevector (k). For simplicity and instructional purposes, I will focus on the point kinetics model, where the spatial dependence is ignored. This simplifies the Power Spectral Density (PSD) to be a function of frequency only, `S(ω)`. The characteristic shape of this function is a Lorentzian.\n4.  **Construct Python Code**: I will write a Python script that does not compute a numerical value but instead defines and prints the famous equation for the Power Spectral Density (PSD) based on the point kinetics model. The script will clearly print each component of the equation, satisfying the prompt's instructions.\n\nThis approach will directly answer your theoretical question while using Python code to illustrate the mathematical form as requested.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef print_psd_explanation_and_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the equation for the Power Spectral Density (PSD)\n    in the context of nuclear reactor noise analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Explanation ---\n    intro = \"\"\"\n    In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier \n    transform of the generalized pair correlation function is called the \n    Power Spectral Density (PSD), often denoted as S(k, ω).\n\n    When simplifying to a point reactor model (ignoring spatial dependence), \n    this becomes a function of angular frequency (ω) only, S(ω).
