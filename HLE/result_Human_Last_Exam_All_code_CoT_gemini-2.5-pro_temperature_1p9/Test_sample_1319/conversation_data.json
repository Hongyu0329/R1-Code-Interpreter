    "To determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Candidate Mountains:** I will first identify the mountains, apart from Mount Olympus, that are mentioned in Homer's Iliad. These include Mount Ida (near Troy), Mount Athos, and Samothrace (a mountainous island).\n2.  **Find Modern Elevations:** I will look up the current-day elevations for each of these mountains.\n3.  **Compare Elevations:** I will write a Python script to store these mountains and their elevations in a dictionary. The script will then iterate through the dictionary to find the mountain with the highest elevation.\n4.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the name and elevation of each candidate mountain for comparison and then declare the tallest among them as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad,\n    excluding Mount Olympus, by comparing the elevations of other mentioned mountains.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of mountains mentioned in the Iliad (besides Olympus) and their elevations in meters.\n    # The elevations are based on their modern-day identities.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey)\": 1774,\n        \"Samothrace (Mount Fengari)\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad (excluding Olympus):\\n\")\n    for mountain, elevation in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {mountain}: {elevation} meters\")\n\n    # Find the mountain with the highest elevation\n    tallest_mountain_name = \"\"\n    tallest_mountain_elevation = 0\n    for mountain, elevation in mountains.items():\n        if elevation > tallest_mountain_elevation:\n            tallest_mountain_elevation = elevation\n            tallest_mountain_name = mountain\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe comparison shows that the tallest among these is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: max(2033, 1774, 1611, 1624) = 2033\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, after Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {tallest_mountain_elevation} meters.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
