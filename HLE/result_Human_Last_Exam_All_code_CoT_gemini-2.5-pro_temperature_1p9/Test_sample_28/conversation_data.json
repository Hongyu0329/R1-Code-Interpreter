    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Hypothesis Class:** The class is $H_{z-ones} = \\{h: X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$, where $|X|=T$. This is the set of all binary functions that label exactly $z$ inputs out of a total of $T$ as '1'.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of VC Dimension:** The VC dimension of a hypothesis class is the size of the largest set of points that can be *shattered* by the class. A set $S$ of size $k$ is shattered if the class can generate all $2^k$ possible labelings for the points in $S$.\n\n3.  **Find the Condition for a Labeling to be Possible:**\n    *   Let's take a set $S$ of size $k$. To check if it can be shattered, we must see if *any* labeling of its points can be created by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$.\n    *   Consider an arbitrary labeling on $S$ which has $j$ points labeled '1' and $k-j$ points labeled '0'.\n    *   A hypothesis $h$ that generates this labeling must assign '1' to these $j$ points. Due to the overall constraint on the class, $h$ must assign a total of $z$ ones. This means that the remaining $z-j$ ones must be assigned to points outside of $S$.\n    *   The number of points available outside of $S$ is $|X \\setminus S| = T-k$.\n    *   Thus, assigning $z-j$ ones to the $T-k$ points outside $S$ is only possible if we can actually choose that many points. This gives us the crucial condition: $0 \\le z-j \\le T-k$.\n\n4.  **Find the Condition for a Set to be Shattered:**\n    *   For the set $S$ of size $k$ to be shattered, the condition from the previous step ($0 \\le z-j \\le T-k$) must be true for *every* possible value of $j$, where $j$ is the number of '1's in the labeling of $S$. The value of $j$ can range from $0$ to $k$.\n    *   To ensure the condition holds for all $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, k\\}$, we only need to check the two most restrictive (i.e., extreme) cases for $j$:\n        *   **When $j=k$ (all points in $S$ labeled '1'):** The condition $0 \\le z-j$ becomes $0 \\le z-k$, which implies $k \\le z$.\n        *   **When $j=0$ (all points in $S$ labeled '0'):** The condition $z-j \\le T-k$ becomes $z \\le T-k$, which implies $k \\le T-z$.\n    *   Therefore, for a set of size $k$ to be shattered, both conditions must be met simultaneously: $k \\le z$ AND $k \\le T-z$. This simplifies to $k \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n5.  **State the Final Result:** The VC dimension is the maximum possible size of a shatterable set, so the largest possible integer value for $k$. Based on our derivation, the maximum value for $k$ is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nThe Python script below will implement a function to calculate this value and demonstrate it with an example.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_vc_dimension(z, T):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the VC dimension for the hypothesis class H_{z-ones}.\n\n    Args:\n        z (int): The fixed number of points labeled as 1. Assumed to be a positive integer.\n        T (int): The total size of the domain X. Assumed to be a positive integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Calculating VC dimension for z = {z} and T = {T}:\")\n\n    # The hypothesis class is empty if z > T. In this case, the VC dimension is 0.\n    # Our formula assumes the class is non-empty (z <= T).\n    if z < 0 or T < 0:\n        print(\"Error: z and T must be non-negative integers.\")\n        return\n    if z > T:\n        print(f\"Since z ({z}) > T ({T}), the hypothesis class is empty.\")\n        print(\"The VC dimension of an empty hypothesis class is 0.\")\n        print(\"---\")\n        return\n\n    # The formula for the VC dimension is min(z, T - z)\n    print(\"The formula is: VC_dim = min(z, T - z)\")\n\n    # Step 1: Show the components of the formula\n    t_minus_z = T - z\n    print(f\"The values are z = {z} and T - z = {T} - {z} = {t_minus_z}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the minimum\n    vc_dim = min(z, t_minus_z)\n    print(f\"The result of min({z}, {t_minus_z}) is {vc_dim}.\")\n    print(f\"The VC dimension is {vc_dim}.\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Example 1: z is smaller than T-z\n    calculate_vc_dimension(z=4, T=15)\n\n    # Example 2: z is larger than T-z\n    calculate_vc_dimension(z=10, T=15)\n\n    # Example 3: z is equal to T-z\n    calculate_vc_dimension(z=10, T=20)\n    \n    # Example 4: Edge case where z=T\n    calculate_vc_dimension(z=15, T=15)\n```\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
