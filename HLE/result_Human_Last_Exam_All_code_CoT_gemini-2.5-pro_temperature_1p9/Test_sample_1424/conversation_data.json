    "Of course. Let's break down the relationship between the bare Green's function and single-particle energies.\n\n### Plan and Explanation\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Quantities:**\n    *   **Bare Green's function, $G_0(k, \\omega)$:** This function, also known as the non-interacting propagator, describes the propagation of a quantum particle (or the absence of a particle, a \"hole\") in a system without any particle-particle interactions. It's a function of momentum (or a general quantum number `k`) and frequency `\\omega`.\n    *   **Single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$:** These are the energies corresponding to the quantum states `k`. They are the eigenvalues of the non-interacting part of the system's Hamiltonian.\n    *   **Fermi Energy, $\\epsilon_F$:** This is a crucial energy level that, at zero temperature, separates the occupied energy states from the unoccupied ones.\n\n2.  **State the Functional Dependence:** The core idea is that the propagator for adding a particle to the system is different from the propagator for removing one (creating a hole).\n    *   If a state `k` is empty (a **particle** state, where $\\epsilon_k > \\epsilon_F$), the Green's function describes adding a particle with energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n    *   If a state `k` is already filled (a **hole** state, where $\\epsilon_k < \\epsilon_F$), we can't add another particle due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Instead, the Green's function describes removing the existing particle, creating a hole.\n\n3.  **The Formula:** This physical distinction is captured mathematically in the Lehmann representation of the bare Green's function. The final formula, expressed in terms of `k` and `\\omega`, is:\n\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\epsilon_F)}$\n\n    Where:\n    *   $\\eta$ is an infinitesimally small positive number that ensures causality (causes precede effects).\n    *   $\\text{sgn}$ is the sign function, which is +1 if its argument is positive and -1 if it's negative.\n\n    This single formula conveniently combines the two cases:\n    *   **For particles ($\\epsilon_k > \\epsilon_F$):** $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n    *   **For holes ($\\epsilon_k < \\epsilon_F$):** $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\eta}$\n\n4.  **Demonstration with Code:** I will now provide a Python script that explicitly shows this dependence. The script will take example values for $\\omega$, $\\epsilon_F$, and two different values for $\\epsilon_k$ (one for a particle, one for a hole) and print the resulting equation for each case, inserting the numbers directly into the formula.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates the functional dependence of the bare Green's function (G_0)\n    on the single-particle energy eigenvalue (ϵ_k) by showing the formula for\n    both particle and hole propagation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define physical parameters for the demonstration ---\n    omega = 5.5       # Example frequency in units of energy\n    epsilon_F = 5.0     # The Fermi energy\n    # For the formula, eta (η) is an infinitesimal.
