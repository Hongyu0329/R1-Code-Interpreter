    print("\nCorrect Mechanism:")
    print("A. Through direct vasodilation: Magnesium acts as a natural calcium antagonist (or calcium channel blocker). By inhibiting the influx of calcium into vascular smooth muscle cells, it causes the muscles to relax. This relaxation leads to vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels), which reduces peripheral resistance and lowers blood pressure.")
    
    print("\nAnalysis of Other Options:")
    print("B. By protecting elastic fibers from calcium deposition: This is a plausible long-term benefit of magnesium but not the most direct mechanism for reducing elevated blood pressure.")
    print("C. By increasing white matter and gray matter in the brain: This is not a recognized mechanism for blood pressure regulation.")
    print("D. By stimulating an inflammatory response: Inflammation generally contributes to, rather than alleviates, high blood pressure.")
    print("E. It raises systemic blood calcium levels: This is physiologically incorrect; magnesium and calcium are often antagonistic.")
    
    print("\nBased on this analysis, direct vasodilation is the correct answer.")
