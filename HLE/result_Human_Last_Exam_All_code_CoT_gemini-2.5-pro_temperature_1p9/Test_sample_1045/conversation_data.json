    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula and atom count:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. This means it contains 7 carbon (C) atoms and 8 hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set notation:** This is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. We need to determine how many basis functions it assigns to each type of atom.\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** Carbon is a second-row element.\n        *   **Core (1s orbital):** The '6' means the core electrons are described by a single contracted function made from 6 primitive Gaussians. (1 function)\n        *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The '31' means the valence shell is \"split\" into two sets of basis functions.\n            *   An \"inner\" valence set (2s, 2p) described by one contracted function for each orbital (one s-type, three p-type), each made from 3 primitives. (1+3 = 4 functions)\n            *   An \"outer\" valence set (2s', 2p') described by another contracted function for each orbital, each made from a single primitive Gaussian. (1+3 = 4 functions)\n        *   Total functions for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 functions**.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n        *   **Valence (1s orbital):** The 1s orbital is split according to the '31' notation.\n            *   An \"inner\" 1s function contracted from 3 primitives. (1 function)\n            *   An \"outer\" 1s' function consisting of 1 primitive. (1 function)\n        *   Total functions for one Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = **2 functions**.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions:** Multiply the number of each atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and sum the results.\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# 2. Define the number of contracted basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s', 2p') = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s') = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# 3. Calculate the sub-totals for each element\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# 4. Calculate the grand total\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# 5. Print the final calculation showing each step\nprint(f\"To calculate the total contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Total Functions = (Number of Carbon Atoms * Functions per C) + (Number of Hydrogen Atoms * Functions per H)\")\nprint(f\"Total Functions = ({num_carbon_atoms} * {functions_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} * {functions_per_hydrogen})\")\nprint(f\"Total Functions = {total_carbon_functions} + {total_hydrogen_functions}\")\nprint(f\"Total Functions = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
