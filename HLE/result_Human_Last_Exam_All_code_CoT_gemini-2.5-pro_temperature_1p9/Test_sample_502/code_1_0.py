    # 1. Define the parameters given in the problem.
    # The order of the group G.
    G_order = 10000
    # The number of variables in the polynomial ring R = C[x_1, ..., x_n].
    # This corresponds to the dimension of the vector space V = C^n that G acts upon.
    n = 10

    # 2. State the relevant mathematical theorem.
    # The dimension of the quotient ring R/I (the coinvariant algebra) is equal to the
    # order of the group H that acts effectively on the polynomial ring R.
    # The action of G on C^n is given by a homomorphism rho: G -> GL_n(C).
    # The group effectively acting is the image H = rho(G).
    # So, the dimension of R/I is |H|, the order of the image group.

    # 3. Formulate the optimization problem.
    # We want to find the largest possible value for dim(R/I) = |rho(G)|.
    # According to the first isomorphism theorem for groups, the order of the image of a
    # homomorphism is the order of the domain group divided by the order of the kernel.
    # |rho(G)| = |G| / |ker(rho)|

    # To maximize this value, we need to minimize the order of the kernel, |ker(rho)|.

    # 4. Solve the optimization.
    # The kernel is a subgroup, so its smallest possible order is 1.
    # This corresponds to the case where the kernel is the trivial group, {e},
    # which means the representation rho is faithful (injective).
    min_kernel_order = 1

    # 5. Calculate the maximum possible dimension.
    # This maximum value is achieved if a group G of order 10000 exists that
    # satisfies the problem's conditions and admits a faithful 10-dimensional representation.
    # Such a group exists. For example, G = C_100 x C_100 (the direct product of two cyclic
    # groups of order 100) has order 10000 and has a faithful representation in GL_2(C),
    # which can be easily extended to a faithful representation in GL_10(C) and GL_100(C).
    # Thus, the maximum is achievable.
    max_dimension = G_order / min_kernel_order
