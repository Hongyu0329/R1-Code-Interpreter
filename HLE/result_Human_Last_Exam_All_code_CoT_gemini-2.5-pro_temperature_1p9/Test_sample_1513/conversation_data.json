    "This is a geographical trivia question. I will identify the key characteristics described and use them to pinpoint the specific location.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Isolation:** The location is an island town more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island. This points to one of the most remote places on Earth, such as Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, or the Pitcairn Islands.\n    *   **Geology:** The town is situated on a bay that was formed by a volcanic caldera. This is a very specific geological feature.\n    *   **Nomenclature:** The bay and the town share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:**\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, is extremely remote but sits on a coastal plain, not a bay formed by a caldera.\n    *   **Pitcairn Islands:** The main settlement, Adamstown, is above Bounty Bay, but this bay is not a caldera.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** This island is extremely isolated (over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands). Its main town is Hanga Roa, which sits on Hanga Roa Bay. The island is entirely of volcanic origin and contains several major calderas. While the bay itself isn't a perfect, self-contained caldera, it's the harbor on this volcanic edifice. Hanga Roa is the only candidate that strongly fits all three clues.\n\n3.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that stores the answer and prints it clearly for the user, incorporating the key number from the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_geography_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying the location based on the given clues\n    and prints the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue from the riddle\n    distance_clue_km = 500\n\n    # The identified answer and its details\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    island_name = \"Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\"\n    bay_name = \"Hanga Roa Bay\"\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final answer\n    print(f\"The island town more than {distance_clue_km} kilometers from another inhabited island is {town_name}.\")\n    print(f\"{town_name} is the main town on {island_name}.\")\n    print(f\"It sits on a bay called {bay_name}, which shares the town's name and is located on the volcanic island.\")\n\nsolve_geography_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which island town, more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
