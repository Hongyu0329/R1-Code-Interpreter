This choice provides a sound logical explanation for the observed facts.
The initial rule 'If P, then Q' is refined to 'If (P and not R), then Q'.
This means the dog only barks if it detects an intruder AND it is awake.

Given the evidence:
1. P is true (An intruder was detected).
2. ¬Q is true (The dog did not bark).

From the refined rule [(P ∧ ¬R)→Q], we can use modus tollens. The contrapositive is ¬Q → ¬(P ∧ ¬R), which simplifies to ¬Q → (¬P ∨ R).
Since ¬Q is true, it follows that (¬P ∨ R) must be true.
We already know from the evidence that P is true.
For the statement (¬P ∨ R) to be true when P is true, R must be true.
Therefore, the conclusion that the dog was asleep (R) is logically derived and resolves the contradiction. It explains why a capable dog detected an intruder but failed to bark.
