def find_cohomology_of_M7():
    """
    This function calculates and prints the list of cohomology groups of M(7), the moduli
    space of 7 disjoint linearly embedded closed intervals in the plane.

    The argument proceeds in steps:
    1.  The space M(k) of k disjoint line segments in R^2 is homotopy equivalent
        to the configuration space of k distinct unordered points in R^2, denoted C_k(R^2).
        This homotopy equivalence is given by shrinking each segment to its center.
    2.  The space C_k(R^2) is an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(B_k, 1), where B_k is the
        k-strand braid group.
    3.  This implies that the cohomology of M(k) is isomorphic to the group cohomology
        of the braid group B_k. For k=7, we have H^*(M(7); Z) ~= H^*(B_7; Z).
    4.  The integral cohomology of B_7 has been computed by mathematicians. This function
        uses the known results (from A. Salch, 2013) to list the cohomology groups.
