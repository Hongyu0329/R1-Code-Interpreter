    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\nThe problem asks for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. The order of the integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ matters, so we are looking for the number of ordered tuples.\n\nA brute-force search that iterates through all possible values for each of the five variables would be too slow. A more efficient method is to find the unique sets of non-negative integers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ that satisfy the equation first, and then for each set, calculate how many unique ordered solutions (permutations) can be generated from it.\n\n1.  **Find Unique Solution Sets:** To find the unique sets of numbers without duplication, I will write a script to search for solution tuples $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that are sorted in a non-increasing order: $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$. This constraint ensures that each combination of numbers is found exactly once. I'll use a series of nested loops with dynamically adjusted bounds to keep the search space manageable.\n\n2.  **Calculate Permutations:** For each unique set of numbers found, the script will calculate the number of distinct ordered tuples that can be formed by permuting its elements. If a set contains numbers with repetitions, the number of permutations is given by the multinomial coefficient formula: $\\frac{5!}{n_1! n_2! \\dots n_k!}$, where $n_i$ is the number of times the i-th distinct number appears in the set.\n\n3.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutation counts for all the unique sets found.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will first find all unique sets of integers, print them out as requested, and then calculate and print the total number of ordered solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_sum_of_squares_solutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-negative integer solutions to\n    x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = 2024.\n\n    The method finds all unique sets of 5 integers {x1,..,x5} whose\n    squares sum to 2024 and then counts all possible permutations of each set.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    unique_solution_sets = []\n    \n    # The maximum possible value for any xi is floor(sqrt(2024)) = 44.\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(target))\n\n    # To find unique sets, we enforce an order x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= x4 >= x5 >= 0.\n    # We iterate from largest possible values to smallest to prune the search space faster.\n    for x1 in range(limit, -1, -1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        limit2 = int(math.sqrt(target - s1))\n        for x2 in range(min(x1, limit2), -1, -1):\n            s2 = x2 * x2\n            sum2 = s1 + s2\n            limit3 = int(math.sqrt(target - sum2))\n            for x3 in range(min(x2, limit3), -1, -1):\n                s3 = x3 * x3\n                sum3 = sum2 + s3\n                limit4 = int(math.sqrt(target - sum3))\n                for x4 in range(min(x3, limit4), -1, -1):\n                    s4 = x4 * x4\n                    sum4 = sum3 + s4\n                    \n                    # Calculate the required value for x5^2 and check if it's a perfect square.\n                    remaining = target - sum4\n                    x5 = int(math.sqrt(remaining))\n                    \n                    if x5 * x5 == remaining:\n                        # Final check for the ordering constraint.\n                        if x5 <= x4:\n                            solution_set = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n                            unique_solution_sets.append(solution_set)\n\n    # Output all the unique solution sets found.\n    # This addresses the \"output each number in the final equation\" instruction.\n    print(f\"Found {len(unique_solution_sets)} unique sets of numbers that solve the equation:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    # Sort for consistent output presentation\n    for s in sorted(unique_solution_sets):\n        print(f\"Set: {s} -> {s[0]}^2 + {s[1]}^2 + {s[2]}^2 + {s[3]}^2 + {s[4]}^2 = 2024\")\n\n    # Calculate total number of ordered solutions by summing permutations.\n    total_solutions = 0\n    for s in unique_solution_sets:\n        counts = Counter(s)\n        permutations = math.factorial(5)\n        for count in counts.values():\n            permutations //= math.factorial(count)\n        total_solutions += permutations\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The total number of non-negative integer solutions is:\")\n    print(total_solutions)\n\n# Run the solver\nfind_sum_of_squares_solutions()\n```\n<<<73840>>>"
