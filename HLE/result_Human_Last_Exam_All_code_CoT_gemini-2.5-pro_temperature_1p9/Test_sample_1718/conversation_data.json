    "The number of independent components of the Riemann curvature tensor depends on the dimension of the manifold and any special geometric structures it possesses. For a Kähler manifold, the presence of a compatible complex structure imposes additional symmetries on the Riemann tensor, which significantly reduces the number of its independent entries compared to a general Riemannian manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold, so its real dimension `n` must be even. We denote its complex dimension by `m`, where `n = 2m`.\n2.  The additional symmetries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold mean that it is completely determined by the components of the form `R_{α\\bar{\\beta}γ\\bar{\\delta}}`, where `α, β, γ, δ` are complex indices ranging from `1` to `m`.\n3.  These non-zero components satisfy symmetries that allow us to think of them as the entries of a Hermitian matrix `M` of size `N x N`, where `N = m(m+1)/2`.\n4.  The number of independent real components in an `N x N` Hermitian matrix is `N^2`.\n5.  Therefore, the total number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is given by the formula: `(m * (m + 1) / 2)^2`.\n6.  I will provide a Python script that takes the complex dimension `m` as input, calculates this number, and displays the breakdown of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_riemann_components_kahler():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        m_str = input(\"Enter the complex dimension of the Kähler manifold (m): \")\n        m = int(m_str)\n        if m < 1:\n            print(\"Error: The complex dimension must be a positive integer.\")\n            return\n\n        print(f\"\\nFor a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m}:\")\n        print(\"The real dimension n is 2 * m =\", 2 * m)\n        \n        # The formula is (m * (m+1) / 2)^2\n        # We will show each number in the equation\n        \n        m_plus_1 = m + 1\n        numerator_1 = m * m_plus_1\n        base = numerator_1 / 2\n        \n        # We need to handle the case where base is not an integer, but it always is\n        # because either m or m+1 is even.\n        base = int(base) \n        \n        result = base ** 2\n\n        print(\"\\nThe formula for the number of independent components is (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2.\")\n        print(\"Let's substitute the value of m:\")\n        print(f\"({m} * ({m} + 1) / 2)^2\")\n        print(f\"= ({m} * {m_plus_1} / 2)^2\")\n        print(f\"= ({numerator_1} / 2)^2\")\n        print(f\"= ({base})^2\")\n        print(f\"= {result}\")\n        \n        print(f\"\\nResult: A Kähler manifold of complex dimension {m} has {result} independent Riemann tensor components.\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input.
