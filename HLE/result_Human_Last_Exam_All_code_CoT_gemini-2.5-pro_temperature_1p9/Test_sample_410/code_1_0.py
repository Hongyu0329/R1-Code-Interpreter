# Step 1: Define the function f(x) by finding its coefficients.
# The problem gives f(x) = a_f*e^(2x) + b_f*e^x + c_f.
# From lim_{x->-inf} (f(x)+3)/e^x = 1, we find c_f = -3 and b_f = 1.
# From f(ln(2)) = 0, we find a_f = 1/4.
a_f = 1/4
b_f = 1
c_f = -3

# This defines the function f(x)
def f(x):
  return a_f * math.exp(2*x) + b_f * math.exp(x) + c_f

# Step 2: Analyze the integral equation and find the relation between a and b.
# The identity for integrals of inverse functions is:
# Integral[f(x), {x, d, c}] + Integral[g(y), {y, f(d), f(c)}] = c*f(c) - d*f(d)
# The given equation is:
# Integral[f(x), {x, ln(2), ln(b)}] + Integral[g(x), {x, 0, a}] = a*ln(b)
#
# Comparing the two, we set d=ln(2) and c=ln(b).
# We know f(ln(2)) = 0 from the problem statement.
# This implies that a = f(ln(b)).

# Step 3: Find the unique solution pair (a,b).
# The relationship a = f(ln(b)) defines a curve of solutions.
# A unique solution is found by considering a special case, for example,
# when one of the integrals becomes zero.
# If the integral of f(x) from ln(2) to ln(b) is zero, then ln(b) must equal ln(2).
# This gives b = 2.
b = 2

# Now calculate a using the relation a = f(ln(b))
# a = f(ln(2))
# The value of f(ln(2)) is given as 0 in the problem statement.
a = 0

# The unique solution found is (a, b) = (0, 2).
# Let's verify this in the original equation:
# Integral_g(from 0 to 0) + Integral_f(from ln(2) to ln(2)) = 0 * ln(2)
# 0 + 0 = 0, which is correct.

# Step 4: Calculate the final result a+b.
result = a + b

print(f"Based on the analysis, we found a unique solution for the integral equation to be a = {a} and b = {b}.")
print("The final calculation is the sum a + b.")
