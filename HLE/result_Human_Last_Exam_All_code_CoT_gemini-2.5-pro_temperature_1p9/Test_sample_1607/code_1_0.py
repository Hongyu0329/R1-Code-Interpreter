    This function determines the correct statements based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

    A) False. The generator's spectrum can be continuous (e.g., momentum).
    B1) False. The premise [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is not satisfied for Hamiltonians of the form H = p²/2m + V(r) due to quantum anomalies.
    B2) False. The scaling transformation generated by τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂ is quantitatively different from the one stated.
    C) False. The condition [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is both necessary and sufficient for [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0.
    D) True. Since [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0, H(τ̂|ψ⟩) = τ̂H|ψ⟩ = E(τ̂|ψ⟩).
    E) False. The rotation operator for an angle θ is exp(-iθL_z/ħ), not exp(-iθL_z).
    F) True. Conservation of ⟨τ̂⟩ for all states requires [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0.
    G) False. exp(cA) and exp(dA) always commute, regardless of whether A is Hermitian.
    H) False. An unbounded operator like L_z can have a discrete spectrum, leading to a discrete spectrum for Ŝ.
    I) True. By the BCH formula, e^A e^B ≠ e^(A+B) since [τ̂₁, τ̂₂] ≠ 0.
    J) True. Since [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0, H(Ŝ|ψ⟩) = ŜH|ψ⟩ = E(Ŝ|ψ⟩).

    The true statements are D, F, I, and J.
