    "My plan is to first identify the specific protein based on the biological process described. The process involves a protein being \"broken down\" (cleaved) to tag amyloid, which then signals macrophages to \"engulf\" (phagocytose) it. This process is known as opsonization. I will research the key protein in the opsonization of amyloid for macrophage clearance. Once identified, I will write a simple Python script to print the name of this protein as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The biological process described is opsonization, where a substance is marked for ingestion by a phagocyte.\n# In the context of amyloid clearance, a key protein from the complement system is cleaved or \"broken down\".\n# One of its fragments then binds to the amyloid fibrils.\n# This fragment acts as a tag that is recognized by receptors on macrophages (and microglia in the brain),\n# signaling them to engulf and clear the amyloid.\n# The central protein in this pathway is Complement component 3.\n\n# Define the protein name\nprotein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is:\")\nprint(protein_name)\n\n# Although there is no mathematical equation in this biological question,\n# I will fulfill the formatting instruction by 'printing' the number from the protein's name.\nequation_number_part = 3\n\nprint(f\"The number in the protein's name is: {equation_number_part}\")\n\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
