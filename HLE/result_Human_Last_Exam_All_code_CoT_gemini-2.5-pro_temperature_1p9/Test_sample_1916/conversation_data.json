    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. A category with one object and 3 morphisms is therefore a monoid of order 3. Two categories are isomorphic if and only if their corresponding monoids are isomorphic.\nThe problem is thus to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n\nLet the set of morphisms be M = {e, f, g}, where 'e' is the identity morphism. The structure of the category is determined by the composition table of these morphisms. The composition operation must be associative, and 'e' must act as the identity element.\n\nMy plan is to systematically generate all possible composition tables and check them for the required properties.\n1.  Represent the morphisms {e, f, g} as {0, 1, 2}, with 0 being the identity.\n2.  The composition table is a 3x3 matrix. The row and column for the identity element (0) are fixed (e.g., `0 * x = x` and `x * 0 = x`).\n3.  This leaves 4 entries in the table to be determined: `1*1`, `1*2`, `2*1`, and `2*2`. Each can be one of {0, 1, 2}.\n4.  This gives `3^4 = 81` possible tables. I will iterate through all of them.\n5.  For each table, I'll check if the composition rule is associative. If it is, the table represents a valid monoid.\n6.  To count them \"up to isomorphism\", I need to group isomorphic monoids. Two monoids are isomorphic if one's table can be transformed into the other's by relabeling the non-identity elements. In our case, this means swapping the roles of 'f' (1) and 'g' (2).\n7.  For each valid monoid table, I will generate its isomorphic counterpart and choose a \"canonical\" representative (the lexicographically smaller of the two table representations).\n8.  I will store these canonical forms in a set to automatically handle duplicates. The final size of the set gives the number of non-isomorphic monoids.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find and count all such categories.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_associative(table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a multiplication table is associative.\n    A table is associative if (x*y)*z = x*(y*z) for all elements x, y, z.\n    \"\"\"\n    for x in range(3):\n        for y in range(3):\n            for z in range(3):\n                # Calculate (x*y)*z using the table\n                lhs = table[table[x][y]][z]\n                # Calculate x*(y*z) using the table\n                rhs = table[x][table[y][z]]\n                if lhs != rhs:\n                    return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_isomorphic_table(table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the table of an isomorphic monoid by swapping the non-identity elements.\n    The isomorphism swaps elements 1 and 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The permutation phi swaps 1 and 2. phi is its own inverse.\n    phi = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}\n    new_table = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # The new table is computed using the rule: T_new(i,j) = phi(T_old(phi(i), phi(j)))\n            new_table[i][j] = phi[table[phi[i]][phi[j]]]\n    return new_table\n\ndef solve_and_print():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts all non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    This corresponds to the number of categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We represent the morphisms {e, f, g} as {0, 1, 2}, where 0 is the identity 'e'.\n    # A monoid's structure is defined by its multiplication table.\n    # The identity element's properties fix the first row and column of the table.\n    # We only need to determine the results for f*f, f*g, g*f, and g*g.\n    \n    # Store the canonical representation of each unique monoid found.\n    canonical_monoids = set()\n\n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible definitions for the four key compositions.\n    # p is a tuple (f*f, f*g, g*f, g*g).\n    for p in itertools.product(range(3), repeat=4):\n        f_f, f_g, g_f, g_g = p\n        \n        # Construct the full multiplication table based on the current combination.\n        table = [\n            [0, 1, 2],       # e * x = x\n            [1, f_f, f_g],   # f * x\n            [2, g_f, g_g]    # g * x\n        ]\n        \n        # Check if the operation is associative.
