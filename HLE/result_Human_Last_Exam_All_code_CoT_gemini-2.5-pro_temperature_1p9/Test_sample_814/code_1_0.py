    # Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms and clinical data.
    print("Clinical Analysis Steps:")
    print("1. Patient Presentation: The patient exhibits a classic constellation of symptoms for Fibromyalgia:")
    print("   - Core Symptoms: Widespread chronic pain (>1 year), severe fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction ('fibro fog').")
    print("   - Mood Symptoms: Anxiety and depression are present.")
    print("   - Associated Symptoms: Restless leg syndrome and paraesthesia (numbness/tingling) are also reported.")
    print("2. Diagnostic Workup: The lab results are crucial. Normal thyroid function, ESR, and negative tests for RA and lupus rule out other common causes of these symptoms.")
    print("3. Likely Diagnosis: This clinical picture, with widespread pain and the absence of inflammatory markers, is highly characteristic of Fibromyalgia.")
    
    # Step 2: Evaluate the treatment options for Fibromyalgia.
    print("\nEvaluation of Treatment Options for Fibromyalgia:")
    print("A. Duloxetine+Gabapentin: This is a powerful combination.")
    print("   - Duloxetine: An SNRI that is FDA-approved for Fibromyalgia. It targets both the centralized pain and the patient's depression/anxiety.")
    print("   - Gabapentin: An anticonvulsant effective for neuropathic pain. It specifically addresses the patient's paraesthesia and restless leg syndrome, and can also help with sleep.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This combination targets the widest range of the patient's specific symptoms.")

    print("\nB. Gabapentin: Addresses the neuropathic pain, RLS, and sleep issues, but does not directly treat the underlying depression/anxiety as well as an SNRI.")

    print("\nC. Duloxetine: An excellent first-line choice for the pain and mood symptoms, but may not be as effective as Gabapentin for the patient's specific RLS and paraesthesia complaints.")

    print("\nD. Cyclobenzaprine: A muscle relaxant primarily used at a low dose for improving sleep. It is considered an adjunctive therapy and does not address the core pain and mood disorders.")

    print("\nE. Duloxetine+Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen provides minimal benefit for the central pain of Fibromyalgia. The patient is already getting some relief from Ibuprofen (an NSAID), and adding acetaminophen is unlikely to be significantly helpful.")

    print("\nF. Duloxetine+Cyclobenzaprine: A reasonable combination for pain, mood, and sleep. However, Gabapentin (in option A) is more specific and effective for the restless leg syndrome and paraesthesia the patient is experiencing.")

    # Step 3: Conclude with the best choice.
    print("\nFinal Conclusion:")
    print("The combination of Duloxetine and Gabapentin (Option A) is the most comprehensive choice. It addresses the triad of Fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, sleep disturbance, mood disorders) and also specifically targets the patient's reported restless leg syndrome and paraesthesia.")
    print("This dual-mechanism approach is superior to any single agent or the other combinations listed for this specific clinical presentation.")
