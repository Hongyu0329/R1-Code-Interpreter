    # Part (a): Reasoning
    # A smooth covering D -> D_N implies ord(g) = ord(gN) for the generators g = b, w, etc.
    # This means g^k is not in N for 1 <= k < ord(g).
    # Semi-regular action on vertices and faces means N must intersect trivially with their stabilizers.
    # Vertex stabilizers are conjugates of <b> or <w>. Face stabilizers are conjugates of <bw>.
    # Since N is normal, we only need to check that N intersects trivially with <b>, <w>, and <bw>.
    # If N had a non-trivial intersection with <b>, it would contain an element b^k, which would
    # contradict the smooth covering condition. Thus, the intersection is trivial.
    # This proves the action is semi-regular.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): Reasoning
    # The question provides a definition for a quasi-simple group G as one where
    # G/Z(G) is simple and G = G'. The condition G = G' is the definition of a perfect group.
    # Therefore, by the definition given, if G is quasi-simple, it is necessarily perfect.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Reasoning
    # The conditions imply that G is a face-quasiprimitive group where for a minimal normal subgroup N,
    # the quotient group G/N is cyclic. We check this against the O'Nan-Scott types.
    # - Diagonal types (SD, CD) are impossible because a cyclic stabilizer <b> cannot contain a non-abelian simple subgroup.
    # - Holomorph types with multiple socle components (HS, HC) are impossible because the cyclic quotient G/N
    #   cannot contain another non-cyclic/non-abelian minimal normal subgroup.
    # - Established results in the study of face-quasiprimitive regular maps show that the Twisted Wreath (TW)
    #   type does not occur in this context.
    # - The remaining types (HA) Holomorph Affine, (AS) Almost Simple, and (PA) Product Action are all possible.
    answer_c = "AS, HA, PA"

    # Print the final combined answer in the specified format.
