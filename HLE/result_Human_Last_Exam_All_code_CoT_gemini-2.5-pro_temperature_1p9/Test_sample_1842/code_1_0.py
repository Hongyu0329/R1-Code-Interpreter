# Step 1: Explain the factorization of the equation.
print("The original Diophantine equation is:")
print("x^7 + (y^3-z^3)x^4 + (y^4+z^4-w^4)x^3 + y^7-z^3y^4 + (z^4-w^4)y^3-z^7+w^4z^3 = 0\n")

print("By grouping and factoring terms, the equation can be greatly simplified to:")
print("(x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4) * (x^3 + y^3 - z^3) = 0\n")

# Step 2: Analyze the two resulting cases.
print("This implies that one of the two factors must be zero, giving us two cases:\n")

print("Case 1: x^3 + y^3 - z^3 = 0  =>  x^3 + y^3 = z^3")
print("By Fermat's Last Theorem, this equation has no solutions for positive integers x, y, and z.\n")

print("Case 2: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4 = 0  =>  x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4")
print("Therefore, we must find a solution to this equation.\n")

# Step 3: Provide the known smallest solution.
print("This equation is a counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture.")
print("The solution with the smallest maximum of {x, y, z, w} was found by Roger Frye in 1988.")
print("The values for this solution are a permutation of x, y, z from {95800, 217519, 414560} and w = 422481.\n")

# Step 4: Assign values, verify the equation, and calculate the sum.
x = 95800
y = 217519
z = 414560

print(f"z = {z}")
print(f"w = {w}\n")

print(f"The equation with these values is:")
print(f"{x}^4 + {y}^4 + {z}^4 = {w}^4")

# Verification (optional, but good practice)
left_side = x**4 + y**4 + z**4
