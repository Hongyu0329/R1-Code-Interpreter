print("This problem asks for the first positive root c1 of an equation for generating amplitudes for a periodic boundary-value problem.")

print("The unperturbed system z' = Az with the given matrix A has solutions u(t) = c1*exp(t), v(t) = c2*exp(-t).")
print("For a 2*pi-periodic solution, we need u(0)=u(2*pi) and v(0)=v(2*pi), which implies c1=0 and c2=0. The only periodic solution is the trivial one, z(t)=0.")
print("\nStep 2: Correcting the problem statement")
print("The term 'equation for generating amplitudes' is used when the unperturbed system has a family of periodic solutions. This suggests there is a typo in the matrix A.")
print("We assume the problem intended to use the matrix for a simple harmonic oscillator, which is standard for van der Pol type equations.")

print("We are asked to find c1 > 0 when c1 = c2. Let's set c = c1 = c2.")
