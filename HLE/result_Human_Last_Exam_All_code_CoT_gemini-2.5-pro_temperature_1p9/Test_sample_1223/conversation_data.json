    "This is a problem in advanced topology, specifically concerning properties of indecomposable continua and Stone-Čech compactifications. The solution does not involve a numerical calculation but rather the application of established mathematical theorems.\n\nHere is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n1.  First, I will identify the key object in the question, which is the Stone-Čech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n2.  I will state a fundamental theorem from topology that describes the nature of this remainder. It turns out this remainder is itself an indecomposable continuum.\n3.  Next, I will state another theorem that specifies the number of composants for any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum. This number is a specific infinite cardinality.\n4.  By combining these two theorems, I can determine the number of composants for the remainder. This value is constant for all such spaces, so the maximum is simply that value.\n5.  The cardinality is known as 'c' (the cardinality of the continuum), which is equal to $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This expression contains the numbers 2 and 0, which I will output as requested.\n6.  Finally, I will present the explanation and print the results in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This is a theoretical problem, so the code will explain the result\n# based on known theorems rather than perform a calculation.\ndef solve_composant_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the solution to the topological problem about the number of\n    composants in the Stone-Cech remainder.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the space in question.\")\n    print(\"The problem asks for the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of X \\\\ {x}, which we denote as R.\")\n    print(\"Here, X is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\")\n    print(\"The remainder is the set of points in the compactification that are not in the original space: R = β(X \\\\ {x}) \\\\ (X \\\\ {x}).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply a key theorem about the nature of this remainder.\")\n    print(\"A major result in topology states that for any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum X and any point x in X, the remainder R is itself a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Apply a key theorem about the structure of indecomposable continua.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental property of any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is that it has precisely 'c' composants, where 'c' is the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Combine the theorems to find the answer.\")\n    print(\"From Step 2, we know the remainder R is an indecomposable continuum.
