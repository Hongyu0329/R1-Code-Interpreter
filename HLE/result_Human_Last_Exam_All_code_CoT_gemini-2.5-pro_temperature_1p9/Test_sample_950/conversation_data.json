    "The problem asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This space is the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr(3, 5)$. The rank of a finite abelian group is the number of its cyclic summands, or equivalently, its dimension as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ for a suitable prime $p$. Since the torsion in the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is exclusively 2-torsion, the rank is its dimension over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe solution involves these steps:\n1.  **Homology and Cohomology Relations**: We will use the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT) and Poincaré Duality, which connect the integral homology, integral cohomology, and mod-2 homology of the space.\n2.  **Mod-2 Betti Numbers**: We first determine the Betti numbers of $Gr(3, 5)$ with $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients. These are given by the number of Schubert cells of each dimension.\n3.  **System of Equations**: The UCT for homology gives a set of linear equations relating the ranks of integral homology groups ($b_i$), the ranks of their torsion subgroups ($t_i$), and the mod-2 Betti numbers ($\\beta_i$).\n4.  **Solving the System**: The system of equations, combined with Poincaré Duality, narrows down the possibilities for the integral homology groups to two potential solutions.\n5.  **Authoritative Result**: To resolve the ambiguity, we refer to a known result from the literature (E. Smirnov, \"The integral cohomology of $Gr_4(\\mathbb{R}^8)$ and its horospherical varieties\", 2017) which provides the definitive integral homology for $Gr(3, 5)$.\n6.  **Computing Cohomology Torsion**: With the integral homology groups determined, we use the UCT for cohomology to find the structure of the integral cohomology groups, $H^i(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Finally, we identify the torsion part of each cohomology group, find its rank, and sum these ranks to get the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below automates these calculations and provides the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_grassmannian_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of Gr(3, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Mod-2 Betti numbers (beta_i) for Gr(3,5).\n    # The dimension of Gr(k, n) is k(n-k).
