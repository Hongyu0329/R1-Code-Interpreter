    # The poem sets a scene of preserved specimens that are also decaying.
    # "Each oval frame contains / an inventory of eyes and dust."

    # Step 2: Analyze the central image related to the moths.
    # The moths are dead and trapped in an unnatural state.
    # "The moths have vanished, / caught behind silvered / dislocation"
    print("The moths are described as 'caught behind silvered dislocation', which refers to being trapped behind the aged glass of a frame, removed from their natural context. 'Silvered' also suggests aging and tarnishing.")

    # Step 3: Deconstruct the specific phrase in question.
    # "that strange tarnished logic of their discipline"
    print("The word 'discipline' can refer to the scientific practice of specimen collection.")
    print("The 'logic' is the rationale for this practice.")
    print("This logic is 'tarnished' because its result is decay ('dust'), linking it to the 'silvered' frame.")
    print("The logic is 'strange' due to the paradox of destroying life to preserve its form, only to watch that form decay.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the options and conclude.
    # Choice B best summarizes this interpretation.
    print("Considering this, the phrase points to how the scientific discipline of preserving specimens is a strange process whose logical outcome is ultimately degradation. This matches option B.")
