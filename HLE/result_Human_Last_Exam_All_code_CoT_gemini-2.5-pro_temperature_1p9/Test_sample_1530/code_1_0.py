  Analyzes the poem's imagery to determine the correct answer.
  The poem uses metaphors of weaving and lacework ("knits a veil", "lace")
  combined with descriptions of cold and fragility ("cold", "glass")
  to describe a natural phenomenon that covers plants ("starwort, grass").
  This phenomenon is later destroyed by Autumn's weather ("roar").
  This is a classic and beautiful description of frost.

  # The poem describes the intricate, lace-like patterns of frost during Autumn.
  # Let's break down the clues:
  # "Naked, cold" -> Describes the conditions for frost.
  # "knits a veil", "lace and glass", "feather stitch" -> Describes the intricate, crystalline structure of frost.
  # "from starwort, grass and meadowsweet" -> Frost forms on plants.
  # "waits for pelted Autumn and his echoed roar to fray each feather stitch" -> Frost is ephemeral and is destroyed by wind or warmer temperatures in Autumn.
