    "The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer hull of a great icosahedron.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the outer hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex, self-intersecting polyhedron. Its outer hull (or convex hull) is the smallest convex shape that contains it. For the great icosahedron, the outer hull is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the triangulation:** The task is to triangulate the surface of this regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 identical equilateral triangle faces.\n3.  **Determine the minimal number:** Since the faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles, the surface is already perfectly triangulated. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles is simply the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n4.  **Write the code:** The python code will state the number of faces of a regular icosahedron and print the result.\n\n```python\n# The outer hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, all of which are triangles.\n# Therefore, the minimal number of triangles to triangulate its surface is simply its number of faces.\n\nnum_faces_of_icosahedron = 20\n\n# The equation is straightforward as no calculation is needed.\n# We present the final number clearly.\nprint(f\"The minimal number of triangles needed is: {num_faces_of_icosahedron}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
