    "The number of subgroups of a given index in a group is a fundamental question in group theory. For the Grigorchuk group, a finitely generated 2-group with remarkable properties, we can determine this number by examining its abelianization.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group, denoted as *G*, is generated by four involutions (elements of order 2), typically labeled *a, b, c,* and *d*. A key characteristic of this group is that it is a 2-group, which means every element has an order that is a power of 2. Furthermore, a significant result by Pervova shows that every maximal subgroup of the Grigorchuk group has an index of 2. This implies that all subgroups of index 2 are maximal and thus normal in *G*.\n\nThe number of normal subgroups of index 2 in a group is determined by the structure of its abelianization, which is the quotient group *G*/[*G*,*G*], where [*G*,*G*] is the commutator subgroup. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is the elementary abelian 2-group of rank 3, which is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, denoted as (ℤ/2ℤ)³.\n\nSubgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group correspond to homomorphisms from *G* to a group of order 4. Since the abelianization of *G* is (ℤ/2ℤ)³, any abelian quotient of *G* must be a quotient of (ℤ/2ℤ)³. The groups of order 4 are the cyclic group of order 4 (ℤ/4ℤ) and the Klein four-group ((ℤ/2ℤ)²). As all non-identity elements in the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group have order 2, there are no surjective homomorphisms from *G* to ℤ/4ℤ. Consequently, any quotient of *G* of order 4 must be isomorphic to (ℤ/2ℤ)².\n\nThe number of subgroups of index 4 in *G* is therefore equal to the number of subgroups of index 4 in its abelianization, (ℤ/2ℤ)³. A subgroup of index 4 in (ℤ/2ℤ)³ has order 2 (since the order of (ℤ/2ℤ)³ is 8). A subgroup of order 2 in (ℤ/2ℤ)³ is generated by a non-identity element. There are 2³ - 1 = 7 non-identity elements in (ℤ/2ℤ)³, and each of these elements generates a distinct subgroup of order 2.\n\nThus, the Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\n"
