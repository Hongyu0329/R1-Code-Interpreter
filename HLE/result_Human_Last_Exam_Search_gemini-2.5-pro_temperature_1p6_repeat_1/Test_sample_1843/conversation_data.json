    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n2.  Decompose the character into a product of primitive characters for each prime power factor.\n3.  Determine the number of primitive characters for each prime power conductor that have an order dividing 6.\n4.  Combine these counts to find the number of characters of order exactly 6.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$:\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\nThe prime power factors are $q_1=4$, $q_2=9$, $q_3=7$, $q_4=11$, and $q_5=13$.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposition of the Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ of conductor $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi_i$, where each $\\chi_i$ has a conductor $q_i$ corresponding to the prime power factors of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$\nThe conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of the $\\chi_i$, which is $4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 36036$.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\nWe require this order to be 6.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, the order of each component character, $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6. That is, $o_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Since primitive characters must be non-trivial, their order must be greater than 1.\n\nLet's count the number of primitive characters for each conductor $q_i$ with an order that divides 6.\n\n*   **Conductor $q_1=4=2^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. It has one character of order 1 (the trivial character) and one of order 2. A character modulo 4 is primitive if its conductor is not 1 or 2. The trivial character has conductor 1. The character of order 2 has conductor 4, making it primitive. So, there is 1 primitive character, and its order is 2.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $n_2(4)=1$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q_2=9=3^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. It is cyclic of order 6. The non-primitive characters are those induced by characters modulo 3. The group of characters modulo 3 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, with character orders 1 and 2. Thus, the non-primitive characters mod 9 have orders 1 and 2.\n    The group of characters mod 9 has: 1 character of order 1, 1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, and 2 of order 6.\n    Subtracting the non-primitive ones, we find the number of primitive characters:\n    -   Order 3: $n_3(9)=2$.\n    -   Order 6: $n_6(9)=2$.\n    The possible orders dividing 6 are 3 and 6. Total choices: $2+2=4$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q_3=7$**:\n    For a prime conductor $p$, all non-trivial characters are primitive. The group of characters mod 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of 6, except 1.\n    -   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    -   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    -   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    Total choices: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q_4=11$**:\n    The group of characters mod 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 10 (except 1): 2, 5, 10. The only order that divides 6 is 2.\n    -   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    Total choices: 1.\n\n*   **Conductor $q_5=13$**:\n    The group of characters mod 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 12 (except 1). The orders that also divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    -   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    -   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    -   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    Total choices: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Counts\nLet $o_i$ be the order of the character $\\chi_i$. For the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, we need $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)=6$. This means:\n1.  Each $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  At least one $o_i$ must be a multiple of 2.\n3.  At least one $o_i$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's list the number of choices for each component character such that its order divides 6:\n-   $N_1$ (for $\\chi_1$ with conductor 4): Order must be 2. There is 1 choice.\n-   $N_2$ (for $\\chi_2$ with conductor 9): Orders can be 3 or 6. There are $2+2=4$ choices.\n-   $N_3$ (for $\\chi_3$ with conductor 7): Orders can be 2, 3, or 6. There are $1+2+2=5$ choices.\n-   $N_4$ (for $\\chi_4$ with conductor 11): Order must be 2. There is 1 choice.\n-   $N_5$ (for $\\chi_5$ with conductor 13): Orders can be 2, 3, or 6. There are $1+2+2=5$ choices.\n\nThe total number of combinations of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, ..., \\chi_5)$ where each order $o_i$ divides 6 is $N_1 \\times N_2 \\times N_3 \\times N_4 \\times N_5 = 1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, let's verify the lcm conditions for these 100 combinations.\n-   **Divisibility by 2:** The order of $\\chi_1$ must be 2, and the order of $\\chi_4$ must be 2. Thus, the lcm of the orders will always be a multiple of 2. This condition is always satisfied.\n-   **Divisibility by 3:** For the lcm to be 6, the set of orders must contain a multiple of 3. We check for cases where this condition is *not* met, i.e., where no order is a multiple of 3. This would mean all orders $o_i$ must be divisors of 2. Since all characters are primitive, their orders must be greater than 1, so all orders would have to be 2.\n    -   Number of choices for $o_1=2$: 1\n    -   Number of choices for $o_2=2$: There are no primitive characters of order 2 for conductor 9. So, 0 choices.\n    -   Since there are 0 choices for $\\chi_2$ to have an order of 2, there are no combinations where the lcm is not a multiple of 3.\n\nEvery one of the 100 possible combinations of component characters results in a total order of 6. The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
