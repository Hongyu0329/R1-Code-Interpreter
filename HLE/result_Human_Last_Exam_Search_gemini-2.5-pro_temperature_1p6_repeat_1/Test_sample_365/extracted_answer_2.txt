The final product is a complex tetracyclic ether formed via a tandem sequence of base-catalyzed double bond isomerization followed by an intramolecular 5-exo-trig oxa-Michael cyclization. The structure contains a newly formed five-membered ether ring fused to the original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane and cyclopentane rings.
