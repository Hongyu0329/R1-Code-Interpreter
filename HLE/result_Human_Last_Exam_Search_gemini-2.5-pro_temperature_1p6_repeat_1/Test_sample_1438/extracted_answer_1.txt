The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the rules of Berezin integration, where the integral of a constant is zero and the integral of the variable itself is one. Specifically, for a single Grassmann variable η, the rules are ∫ dη = 0 and ∫ dη η = 1. These rules ensure that the anti-commuting properties of the Grassmann variables, which mathematically represent the Pauli exclusion principle, are maintained.
