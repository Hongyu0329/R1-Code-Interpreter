    "Multiple historical sources confirm that Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. At this time, Geoffrey Chaucer was engaged in diplomatic activities on the continent.\n\nIn 1368, Chaucer, who was an esquire in the king's household, was sent abroad on a diplomatic mission. While the precise itinerary of this mission is not fully documented, there is significant evidence suggesting he may have traveled to Milan, Italy. This journey would have been for the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp, the son of King Edward III, to Violante Visconti, the daughter of the Duke of Milan. The wedding took place in Milan, and Chaucer's attendance is considered a strong possibility by many scholars.\n\nOther sources mention that Chaucer traveled to the continent in 1368 on the \"King's service,\" with some suggesting France as a probable destination. However, the link to the well-documented wedding of Prince Lionel in Milan provides a more specific context for his travels in Italy during that year.\n\nChaucer's famous poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" was written as an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster. Most scholars date its composition to sometime after her death, between late 1368 and 1372. This indicates that upon his return to England, he was commissioned or inspired to write the commemorative piece.\n\nGiven that Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the continent at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death, and the most specific information available points towards a trip to Italy, it is the most likely location of the given choices. He was certainly not in England when she passed away.\n\n<<<A>>>"
