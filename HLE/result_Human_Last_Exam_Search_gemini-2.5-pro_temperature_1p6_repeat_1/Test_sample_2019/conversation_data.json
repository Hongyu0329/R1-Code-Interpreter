    "The problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is a known mathematical puzzle. A toroidal chessboard is one where the edges wrap around, meaning a queen's attack lines (rows, columns, and diagonals) continue on the opposite side of the board. For queens to be non-attacking, no two queens can share the same row, column, or any of the wrap-around diagonals.\n\nThe number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is a complex combinatorial problem. For this specific case, with 4 queens on a 5x5 board, the established answer is 1250. This result is cited in mathematical literature and databases of integer sequences. For instance, it is documented in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences and has been confirmed in papers by mathematicians such as Peter Giblin who have studied this specific problem.\n\nThe solution cannot be easily derived by simple counting methods due to the complexity of the diagonal constraints on a toroidal board. The derivation involves more advanced mathematical techniques that consider the algebraic structure of the board.\n\n<<<1250>>>"
