    "In his work, the historian Fernand Braudel references the assertion made by writer and diplomat Paul Morand that a nation, exemplified by the symbol of France's hexagonal shape, should be understood as inscribed within a larger, global sphere. This assertion emphasizes that a nation's politics and existence are inherently worldly.\n\nA key insight into this concept is found in a Portuguese translation of Braudel's work, \"A Identidade Da França, A Geografia Da França\" (The Identity of France, The Geography of France). In this book, a passage directly attributes to Morand the idea of being \"'inscribed in the sphere'\". This same text also discusses the \"hexagonal\" nature of France as a geographic and political entity.\n\nFurther supporting this connection, the book \"Mediterranean Paradigms and Classical Antiquity\" mentions \"allusions to 'Morand's hexagon' by Braudel and others.\" This reference to \"Morand's hexagon\" solidifies the link between Morand, the symbol of the French nation, and Braudel's interpretation of this concept. The hexagon, representing the defined territory of the nation, is thus placed within the broader context of a global \"sphere,\" reflecting a worldview that no nation is an island and that \"toute politique est mondiale\" (all politics is worldwide).\n\nTherefore, the conceptual entity in question is the **nation**, symbolized by the hexagon of France.\n\n<<<the nation>>>"
