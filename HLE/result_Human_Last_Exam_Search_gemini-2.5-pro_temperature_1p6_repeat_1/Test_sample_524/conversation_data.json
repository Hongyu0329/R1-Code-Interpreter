    "A homogeneous planar continuum is a compact, connected subset of the plane that is also homogeneous, meaning any point can be mapped to any other point by a homeomorphism of the space onto itself. The question of how many distinct types of such spaces exist, up to homeomorphism, was a long-standing problem in topology.\n\nA complete classification of these continua was achieved, showing that there are four distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\nThe four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are:\n*   **The point:** This is considered a degenerate continuum.\n*   **The circle:** A simple closed curve.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a one-dimensional, arc-like, but hereditarily indecomposable continuum, meaning it cannot be broken down into two proper subcontinua. R. H. Bing showed it was homogeneous in 1948.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This space is constructed by continuously mapping it onto a circle where each point on the circle corresponds to a pseudo-arc. It was shown to be a homogeneous plane continuum by Bing and Jones.\n\nIn 2014, Logan Hoehn and Lex Oversteegen proved that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of these three: the circle, the pseudo-arc, or the circle of pseudo-arcs. Including the degenerate case of a single point, this brings the total number of homeomorphism classes to four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
