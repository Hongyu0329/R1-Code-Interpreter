    "The number of n-step self-avoiding walks, a(n), on a Manhattan lattice (also known as a square lattice) is a sequence well-documented in combinatorics. A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. There is no simple formula to calculate a(n), but its values have been computed for small n.\n\nThe sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411. The initial values of the sequence are a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, and a(3) = 36. For a 10-step walk, the value a(10) is 44100.\n\nThe known values for n from 1 to 10 are as follows:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   a(10) = 44100\n\n<<<44100>>>"
