    "The minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects all lines with the equation px+qy=1, where p and q are coprime integers, is 2.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\nFirst, let's establish a minimum bound for the area. Let K be a convex domain that satisfies the given condition.\n\n*   The line for (p,q) = (1,0) is x=1. K must intersect this line, which implies that the maximum x-coordinate in K is at least 1.\n*   The line for (p,q) = (-1,0) is -x=1, or x=-1. K must intersect this line, so the minimum x-coordinate in K is at most -1.\n*   From these two conditions, the width of the convex set K in the x-direction must be at least 1 - (-1) = 2.\n*   Similarly, for (p,q) = (0,1) and (0,-1), the lines are y=1 and y=-1, respectively. Thus, the width of K in the y-direction must also be at least 2.\n\nA known theorem in convex geometry states that the area of a convex body A is at least half the product of its widths in any two orthogonal directions. Therefore, the area of K must be at least (1/2) * (width in x-direction) * (width in y-direction) ≥ (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2. This shows that the minimal area must be at least 2.\n\nNext, we need to show that an area of 2 is achievable. Consider the convex domain D defined by the inequality |x| + |y| ≤ 1. This shape is a square rotated by 45 degrees, often described as a diamond shape, with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1). The area of this domain is 2.\n\nWe must verify that this domain D intersects every line with the equation px+qy=1 for all coprime integers p and q. A line intersects a convex set if the value of the linear function on the left-hand side of the line's equation, when evaluated over the set, contains the value on the right-hand side. For the domain D, the value of the expression px+qy is bounded by `max(|p|, |q|)`. Thus, the range of `px+qy` for (x,y) in D is `[-max(|p|, |q|), max(|p|, |q|)]`.\n\nFor the line px+qy=1 to intersect D, the value 1 must be within this range. This requires that `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. Since p and q are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. If one of them is non-zero, its absolute value is at least 1, so the condition `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` is always met for any pair of coprime integers (p,q).\n\nSince we have found a convex domain with an area of 2 that satisfies the condition, and we have proven that any such domain must have an area of at least 2, the minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
