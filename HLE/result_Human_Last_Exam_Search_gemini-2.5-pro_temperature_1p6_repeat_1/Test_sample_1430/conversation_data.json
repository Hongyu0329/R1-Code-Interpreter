    "Let C be a genus 3 Riemann surface and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as C¹⁵. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, often called the Picard number and denoted by ρ(X), is the subject of this inquiry.\n\nThe structure of the Néron-Severi group of the symmetric power of a curve is well-understood. For a smooth projective curve C of genus g, and its d-th symmetric power Cᵈ, there is a fundamental relationship between their Néron-Severi groups. When the degree d of the symmetric power is greater than or equal to the genus g, the following isomorphism holds:\n\nρ(Cᵈ) = ρ(J(C)) + 1\n\nHere, J(C) is the Jacobian variety of the curve C, which is a g-dimensional abelian variety. In the given problem, C is a genus g=3 curve, and X is its d=15 symmetric power. Since 15 ≥ 3, the formula is applicable, and thus ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1. The problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group occurs for a \"very general\" curve. For a generic curve C of genus g, its Jacobian J(C) is a simple abelian variety with the minimal possible endomorphism ring, End(J(C)) = ℤ. In this case, the Néron-Severi group NS(J(C)) is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1. Therefore, the minimum possible value for ρ(J(C)) is 1.\n\nThis leads to the smallest possible rank for X:\nρ_min(X) = ρ_min(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of a g-dimensional abelian variety is bounded by h¹﹐¹, which for a complex abelian variety is g². For the Jacobian J(C) of a genus 3 curve, this upper bound is 3² = 9. This maximum rank is achieved when the Jacobian has complex multiplication (CM) and is ρ-maximal.\n\nThis requires J(C) to be isogenous to a product of three isogenous elliptic curves with complex multiplication. The existence of such genus 3 curves is well-established. For instance, there are families of curves whose Jacobians are isogenous to the third power of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, such as E³ where E has CM by ℤ[i].\n\nWhen J(C) is isogenous to a product of three such elliptic curves, its Néron-Severi rank reaches the maximum possible value, ρ(J(C)) = 9.\n\nThis gives the largest possible rank for X:\nρ_max(X) = ρ_max(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nIn summary, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = C¹⁵ can range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 10, depending on the arithmetic and geometric properties of the underlying genus 3 curve C.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
