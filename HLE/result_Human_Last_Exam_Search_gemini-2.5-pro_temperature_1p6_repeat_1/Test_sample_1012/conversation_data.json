    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer could theoretically use Grover's algorithm to significantly speed up the process of breaking symmetric encryption through a brute-force attack. This algorithm doesn't render symmetric ciphers obsolete in the same way Shor's algorithm affects asymmetric cryptography, but it does effectively halve the security of the key.\n\nTo counter the threat posed by Grover's algorithm, the key length of a symmetric cipher must be doubled to maintain the same level of security against a quantum attack as it has against a classical one. For instance, a 128-bit AES key, which is currently a standard for strong encryption, would only offer 64 bits of security against a quantum computer, which is considered insecure.\n\nTo achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum computer—a commonly accepted benchmark for strong cryptographic security—it is necessary to use a symmetric key of at least 256 bits. An AES-256 key, which has a classical security strength of 256 bits, would have its effective security reduced to 128 bits by a quantum attack, a level still considered secure for the foreseeable future. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has indicated a move towards requiring 256-bit AES keys for protecting classified information.\n\nTherefore, to be resistant to an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long.\n\n<<<A>>>"
