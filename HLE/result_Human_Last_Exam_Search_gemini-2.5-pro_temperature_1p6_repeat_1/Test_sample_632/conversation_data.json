    "Until 1950, a unique architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome was the presence of a tramway line. This feature was removed as part of a broader city-wide effort to modernize the public transportation system and to clear the historic center of what was then considered cumbersome infrastructure.\n\nAn old photograph from 1920 shows the tram rails crossing the square in front of the Pantheon. The tram line that passed through the vicinity of the Piazza della Rotonda was part of the \"circolare interna\" or inner circle route.\n\nIn the 1930s, a major reform of Rome's public transport system had already begun to eliminate many tram lines from the city center, replacing them with buses. This trend continued into the post-war era, and the 1950s and 1960s saw the suppression of numerous other tram lines throughout the city.\n\nA historical account mentions that to free up the Piazza della Rotonda, the tram was rerouted to pass through the adjacent Via dei Crescenzi and Via della Rotonda before continuing towards Torre Argentina. While the complete decommissioning of the \"circolare interna\" line occurred in 1959, the process of removing tram infrastructure from the immediate area of the Pantheon was part of a longer-term plan that took shape around the mid-20th century.\n\n<<<The tramway line>>>"
