    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the differential equation $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$. The equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$.\n\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We set $f(x) = 0$ to find the equilibria:\n$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\n\nThe equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of each equilibrium point. For a differential equation $x' = f(x)$, an equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$, and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$. If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the stability cannot be determined from the first derivative test and further analysis is required.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at each equilibrium point:\nFor $x_1 = 0$:\n$f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\nSince $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\n\nFor $x_2 = 1$:\n$f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\nSince $f'(1) = 0$, we need to analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around $x=1$ to determine its stability. The function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\nFor values of $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x)$ is negative. This means that for $x < 1$ near 1, $x'(t) < 0$, so solutions move away from $x=1$.\nFor values of $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x)$ is negative. This means that for $x > 1$ near 1, $x'(t) < 0$, so solutions move towards $x=1$.\nSince solutions on one side of $x=1$ move away from it, while solutions on the other side move towards it, the equilibrium at $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as semi-stable.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. The number of stable equilibria is $m=1$.\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$, we get:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThe final answer is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n$<<<$1 - 2^{4048}$>>>"
