    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a 2-category of posets, is equivalent to an adjunction between posets. An adjunction between two posets, $[n]$ and $[m]$, is a pair of order-preserving maps, the left adjoint $L: [n] \\to [m]$ and the right adjoint $R: [m] \\to [n]$, that satisfy the condition $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [n]$ and $j \\in [m]$.\n\nFor a map to be a left or right adjoint, it must preserve certain structures. Specifically, a map between two complete lattices is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins), and it is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\nThe objects of the simplex category, $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, are finite totally ordered sets. As such, they are complete lattices. For any subset $S \\subseteq [k]$, the supremum is its maximum, $\\sup(S) = \\max(S)$, and the infimum is its minimum, $\\inf(S) = \\min(S)$. An exception is the empty set. In a complete lattice with a bottom element $\\bot$ and a top element $\\top$, the supremum of the empty set is $\\bot$ and its infimum is $\\top$. For $[k]$, we have $\\bot = 0$ and $\\top = k$.\n\nLet's determine the conditions under which an order-preserving map $L: \\to$ is a left adjoint. For $L$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all suprema.\n1.  For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq$, an order-preserving map $L$ automatically preserves its supremum: $L(\\max(S)) = \\max(L(S))$.\n2.  For the empty set $\\emptyset \\subseteq$, its supremum is $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$. The image of the empty set is the empty set, $L(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$. The supremum of the empty set in $$ is $0$. Thus, the preservation of the supremum of the empty set requires $L(\\sup(\\emptyset)) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset))$, which translates to $L(0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, an order-preserving map $L: \\to$ is a left adjoint if and only if it satisfies the condition $L(0) = 0$. Any such left adjoint $L$ uniquely determines its right-adjoint partner $R$. The number of such adjunctions is thus the number of order-preserving maps from $$ to $$ that send $0$ to $0$.\n\nWe need to count the number of sequences $(y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_{23})$ such that $0 \\le y_0 \\le y_1 \\le \\dots \\le y_{23} \\le 37$, with the constraint that $y_0 = L(0) = 0$. This leaves us to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. It is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps from a set with 23 elements (the indices $\\{1, \\dots, 23\\}$) to a set with 38 elements (the possible values $\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$). Let $k=23$ be the number of elements in the domain and $s=38$ be the number of elements in the codomain. The number of such maps is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{s+k-1}{k}$.\n\nPlugging in our values, we get:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nTo verify this, we can also count the number of right adjoints $R: \\to$. For an order-preserving map $R$ to be a right adjoint, it must preserve all infima.\n1.  For any non-empty subset $T \\subseteq$, $R$ preserves its infimum: $R(\\min(T)) = \\min(R(T))$.\n2.  For the empty set $\\emptyset \\subseteq$, its infimum is $\\inf(\\emptyset) = 37$. Its image $R(\\emptyset)=\\emptyset$ has for infimum in $$ the value 23. Thus, preservation requires $R(37) = 23$.\n\nSo we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $R: \\to$ such that $R(37)=23$. This means counting non-decreasing sequences $0 \\le R(0) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$. This is equivalent to counting order-preserving maps from a 37-element set $\\{0, \\dots, 36\\}$ to a 24-element set $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. Here $k=37$ and $s=24$.\nThe number is $\\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we see that $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$, which confirms the previous calculation.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<$ \\binom{60}{23} >>>"
