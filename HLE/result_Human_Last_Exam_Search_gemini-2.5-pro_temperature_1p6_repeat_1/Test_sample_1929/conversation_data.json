    "The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a cycloaddition reaction. Specifically, it can undergo a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition, to form a six-membered ring. In this reaction, butadiene acts as the conjugated diene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene serves as the dienophile.\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexene. The reaction forms a cyclohexene ring where the substituents from the dienophile (chlorine and fluorine atoms) are attached to the carbons that were part of the double bond in 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. A new double bond is formed in the cyclohexene ring.\n\nThe product of the Diels-Alder reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nIt is worth noting that under certain conditions, a [2+2] cycloaddition can also occur, which would result in a different product, a substituted cyclobutane. However, the Diels-Alder reaction is a very common pathway for these reactants.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
