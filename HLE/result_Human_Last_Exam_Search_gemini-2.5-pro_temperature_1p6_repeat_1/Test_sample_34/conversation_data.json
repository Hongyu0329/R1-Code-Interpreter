    "The worst suited jack you should open from the button to 2.5x in a 100BB rake-free cash game is generally considered to be Jack-Five suited.\n\nAccording to pre-flop opening ranges for a 100BB cash game, a player on the button should be opening a wide range of hands, approximately 40.5% of them. This includes suited jacks down to J5s. Hands weaker than this, such as Jack-Four suited or lower, are typically recommended to be folded in this situation.\n\nThe profitability of opening marginal hands like low suited jacks is very dependent on position. While even J7s and J8s might be raised from the cutoff, the range of playable suited jacks expands on the button. Specifically for an unopened pot on the button, J5s is often cited as the weakest suited jack that should be included in a standard opening range.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
