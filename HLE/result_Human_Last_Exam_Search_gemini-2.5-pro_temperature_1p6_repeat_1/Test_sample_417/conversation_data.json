    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a thorough analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry is required.\n\n### Molecular Structure and Symmetry Analysis\n\nThe molecule consists of a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring. At positions 1, 3, and 5, it is substituted with identical, large, and chiral groups. The molecule possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry element makes the three substituent arms and the three methyl groups on the central ring chemically equivalent. Therefore, to find the total number of unique proton signals, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in one repeating unit and on the central core.\n\n### Signal Analysis\n\nThe molecule can be broken down into three distinct parts for NMR analysis:\n1.  **The Central Mesitylene Core**: The three methyl groups attached to the benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These nine protons will produce a single resonance signal.\n2.  **The Methylene Linkers (-CH2-)**: There are three methylene groups linking the central ring to the indazole substituents. Due to the C3 symmetry, these three groups are equivalent. However, within each `-CH2-` group, the two protons are attached to a carbon that is adjacent to a chiral center (the entire indazole moiety). This makes the two protons diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and are expected to have different chemical shifts, typically appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). This contributes two signals to the spectrum.\n3.  **The Chiral Indazole Substituent**: We need to analyze the unique proton environments within one of the `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole` units. This rigid bicyclic structure is derived from camphor. The lack of internal symmetry within this chiral group leads to multiple distinct proton signals:\n    *   **H-3 of the pyrazole ring**: One proton is on the pyrazole part of the indazole system, giving one signal.\n    *   **H-4 bridgehead proton**: There is a single proton at one of the bridgehead carbons, resulting in one signal.\n    *   **C5-Methylene protons**: The two protons of this CH2 group are in different spatial environments (endo and exo) and are therefore diastereotopic, leading to two distinct signals.\n    *   **C6-Methylene protons**: Similarly, the two protons on this CH2 group are also diastereotopic and will produce two signals.\n    *   **C7-Methyl group**: The methyl group attached to the C7 bridgehead is unique and will give one signal.\n    *   **C8-gem-Dimethyl groups**: The two methyl groups are attached to the same carbon (C8). As this carbon is part of a rigid chiral framework, these geminal methyl groups are diastereotopic and thus chemically inequivalent. This results in two separate signals.\n\n### Tally of Expected Signals\n\nSumming the signals from each part:\n*   Central Mesitylene-CH3 groups: 1 signal\n*   Benzylic -CH2- protons: 2 signals\n*   Indazole H-3 proton: 1 signal\n*   Indazole H-4 proton: 1 signal\n*   Indazole C5-H2 protons: 2 signals\n*   Indazole C6-H2 protons: 2 signals\n*   Indazole C7-CH3 group: 1 signal\n*   Indazole C8-(CH3)2 groups: 2 signals\n\n**Total = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12 signals.**\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum of this molecule.\n\n<<<H>>>"
