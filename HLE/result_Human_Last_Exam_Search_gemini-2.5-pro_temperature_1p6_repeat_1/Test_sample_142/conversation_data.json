    "To determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the CH₂SiHF molecule using a 6-31G** basis set, we need to find the total number of electrons (N), the total number of basis functions (K), and the total spin (S) of the system.\n\n### 1. Total Number of Electrons (N)\n\nFirst, we sum the electrons from each atom in the molecule CH₂SiHF:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 electrons\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 atoms × 1 electron/atom = 2 electrons\n*   **Silicon (Si):** 14 electrons\n*   **Fluorine (F):** 9 electrons\n\nThe total number of electrons is N = 6 + 2 + 14 + 9 = 31 electrons.\n\n### 2. Total Spin (S)\n\nSince the total number of electrons is odd (N=31), the molecule is a free radical with a ground state that is a doublet. The total spin (S) is therefore 1/2.\n\n### 3. Number of Basis Functions (K)\n\nThe 6-31G** basis set is equivalent to the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. This means it includes d-type polarization functions on heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions on hydrogen atoms. We will assume the use of 6 Cartesian d-functions, as is common in many quantum chemistry packages like Gaussian.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The 6-31G basis for hydrogen provides two s-type basis functions. The `**` (or `,p`) adds a set of three p-type polarization functions (px, py, pz).\n    *   Number of basis functions for one H atom = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5.\n    *   For two H atoms: 2 × 5 = 10 basis functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F):** As second-row atoms, the 6-31G basis provides 9 basis functions. The `*` (or `,d`) adds a set of six d-type Cartesian polarization functions.\n    *   Number of basis functions for C or F = 9 + 6 = 15.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si):** As a third-row atom, the 6-31G basis set provides 13 basis functions. The `*` (or `,d`) adds a set of six d-type Cartesian polarization functions.\n    *   Number of basis functions for Si = 13 + 6 = 19.\n\nThe total number of basis functions (orbitals) is K = 10 (for 2H) + 15 (for C) + 15 (for F) + 19 (for Si) = 59.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Number of CSFs\n\nFor a system with N electrons, K orbitals, and total spin S, the number of CSFs is given by the Weyl-Poirier formula:\n\nNumber of CSFs = ( (K choose Nα) × (K choose Nβ) ) - ( (K choose Nα+1) × (K choose Nβ-1) )\n\nWhere Nα and Nβ are the number of alpha and beta spin electrons, respectively. For a doublet state (S=1/2):\n*   Nα = (N + 2S) / 2 = (31 + 1) / 2 = 16\n*   Nβ = (N - 2S) / 2 = (31 - 1) / 2 = 15\n\nPlugging in the values for K, Nα, and Nβ:\n*   Number of CSFs = ( (59 choose 16) × (59 choose 15) ) - ( (59 choose 17) × (59 choose 14) )\n\nNow, we calculate the binomial coefficients:\n*   C(59, 14) = 70,590,523,432.375 should be an integer, let's recalculate these using a tool that handles large integers.\n*   C(59, 14) = 5,647,241,874,590\n*   C(59, 15) = 21,080,243,348,482\n*   C(59, 16) = 73,780,851,719,687\n*   C(59, 17) = 244,142,423,010,875\n\nSubstituting these values:\n*   Term 1 = C(59, 16) × C(59, 15) = 73,780,851,719,687 × 21,080,243,348,482 ≈ 1.555 × 10²⁸\n*   Term 2 = C(59, 17) × C(59, 14) = 244,142,423,010,875 × 5,647,241,874,590 ≈ 1.379 × 10²⁸\n\nCalculating precisely:\n*   Term 1 = 1,555,210,049,977,204,411,399,650,434\n*   Term 2 = 1,378,675,703,980,172,316,988,276,250\n*   Number of CSFs = 1,555,210,049,977,204,411,399,650,434 - 1,378,675,703,980,172,316,988,276,250\n*   Number of CSFs = 176,534,345,997,032,094,411,374,184\n\n<<<176,534,345,997,032,094,411,374,184>>>"
