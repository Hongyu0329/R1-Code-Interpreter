    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the specific heat of a system near its critical point is characterized by the critical exponent α. The epsilon (ε) expansion, pioneered by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher, provides a method to calculate critical exponents in a spatial dimension `d` that is close to the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. For a system described by the O(N)-symmetric φ⁴ field theory, which includes the Ising model as a special case, the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n\nThe epsilon expansion involves expressing critical exponents as a power series in `ε = d_c - d = 4 - d`. For a system with a spatial dimension of `d=3`, we have `ε = 1`.\n\nThe scaling relation for the specific heat exponent α is given by the hyperscaling relation:\nα = 2 - νd\nwhere ν is the correlation length exponent and d is the spatial dimension.\n\nUsing the epsilon expansion, the correlation length exponent ν for the O(N) model can be calculated to the first order in ε as:\nν ≈ 1/2 + [(N+2) / (4(N+8))] * ε\n\nBy substituting the expression for ν and `d = 4 - ε` into the hyperscaling relation, we can derive the first-order epsilon expansion for α:\nα = 2 - [1/2 + (N+2)ε / (4(N+8))] * (4 - ε)\nα = 2 - [2 + (N+2)ε / (N+8) - ε/2 - O(ε²)]\nα = ε/2 - (N+2)ε / (N+8) + O(ε²)\nα = [ (N+8 - 2(N+2)) / (2(N+8)) ] * ε + O(ε²)\nα = [ (4 - N) / (2(N+8)) ] * ε + O(ε²)\n\nThis formula gives the specific heat exponent α to the first order in ε for a general O(N) model. The system in question corresponds to the Ising model universality class, which is described by N=1. Substituting N=1 into the general expression for α, we get:\nα = [ (4 - 1) / (2(1+8)) ] * ε = [ 3 / 18 ] * ε = ε / 6\n\nThe question asks for the value of this exponent in a spatial dimension of `d=3`, which corresponds to `ε = 4 - 3 = 1`. Substituting ε=1 into the first-order expansion for α yields:\nα ≈ 1/6\n\nThus, to the leading order in the epsilon expansion, the specific heat exponent α for a system in the Ising universality class at d=3 is 1/6. It is worth noting that while setting ε=1 is a significant extrapolation from the infinitesimal ε for which the expansion is rigorously justified, it often provides surprisingly good estimates for critical exponents.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
