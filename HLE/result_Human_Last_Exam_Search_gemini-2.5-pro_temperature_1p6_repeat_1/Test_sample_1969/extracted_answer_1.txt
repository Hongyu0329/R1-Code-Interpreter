For fixed $n$, the exact amount of money $c_{k}$ that $p_{k}$ gets is given by the formula:
$c_{k} = k \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \left[ \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 - k\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \right]$
which can be simplified to:
$c_{k} = \frac{k \cdot n^2(n+1)^2}{24} \left[ (3n+1)(n+2) - 6k \right]
