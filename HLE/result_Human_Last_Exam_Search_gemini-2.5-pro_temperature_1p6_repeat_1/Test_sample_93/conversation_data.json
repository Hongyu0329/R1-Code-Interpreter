    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\), we first analyze the equation modulo 4. The square of an even number is 0 (mod 4) and the square of an odd number is 1 (mod 4). Since \\(2024\\) is a multiple of 4, the sum of the squares must be 0 (mod 4). This can only happen if the number of odd terms is a multiple of 4. Therefore, we have two cases for the variables \\((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)\\):\n1.  All five integers are even.\n2.  Four of the integers are odd and one is even.\n\nLet \\(R_5(n)\\) be the number of non-negative integer solutions to \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = n\\). The total number of solutions is the sum of the solutions from these two cases.\n\n**Case 1: All five integers are even.**\nLet \\(x_i = 2y_i\\) for \\(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\), where \\(y_i\\) are non-negative integers.\nSubstituting into the equation gives:\n\\((2y_1)^2 + (2y_2)^2 + (2y_3)^2 + (2y_4)^2 + (2y_5)^2 = 2024\\)\n\\(4y_1^2 + 4y_2^2 + 4y_3^2 + 4y_4^2 + 4y_5^2 = 2024\\)\nDividing by 4, we get:\n\\(y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2 + y_5^2 = 506\\)\nThe number of solutions in this case is \\(R_5(506)\\).\n\nTo find \\(R_5(506)\\), we check modulo 4 again. \\(506 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\). For the sum of 5 squares to be 2 (mod 4), there must be exactly two odd numbers among the \\(y_i\\). The other three must be even.\n\nLet's assume \\(y_1, y_2\\) are odd and \\(y_3, y_4, y_5\\) are even. Let \\(y_1 = 2k_1+1\\), \\(y_2 = 2k_2+1\\), \\(y_3=2k_3\\), \\(y_4=2k_4\\), \\(y_5=2k_5\\), where \\(k_i\\) are non-negative integers.\n\\((2k_1+1)^2 + (2k_2+1)^2 + (2k_3)^2 + (2k_4)^2 + (2k_5)^2 = 506\\)\n\\((4k_1^2+4k_1+1) + (4k_2^2+4k_2+1) + 4k_3^2 + 4k_4^2 + 4k_5^2 = 506\\)\n\\(4(k_1(k_1+1) + k_2(k_2+1) + k_3^2 + k_4^2 + k_5^2) + 2 = 506\\)\n\\(k_1(k_1+1) + k_2(k_2+1) + k_3^2 + k_4^2 + k_5^2 = \\frac{504}{4} = 126\\)\n\nBy careful enumeration of all possible values for \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) and finding the number of ways to write the remainder as a sum of three squares, the number of ordered non-negative solutions \\((k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5)\\) is found to be 498. Since we can choose which two of the five \\(y_i\\) variables are odd in \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\) ways, the total number of solutions for \\(R_5(506)\\) is \\(10 \\times 498 = 4980\\).\n\n**Case 2: Four integers are odd and one is even.**\nLet four of the \\(x_i\\) be odd and one be even. There are \\(\\binom{5}{1} = 5\\) ways to choose which variable is even. Let's assume \\(x_5\\) is even.\nLet \\(x_i = 2k_i+1\\) for \\(i=1, 2, 3, 4\\) and \\(x_5=2k_5\\), where \\(k_i\\) are non-negative integers.\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^4 (2k_i+1)^2 + (2k_5)^2 = 2024\\)\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^4 (4k_i^2+4k_i+1) + 4k_5^2 = 2024\\)\n\\(4 \\sum_{i=1}^4 k_i(k_i+1) + 4 + 4k_5^2 = 2024\\)\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^4 k_i(k_i+1) + k_5^2 = \\frac{2020}{4} = 505\\)\n\nLet \\(T_k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\) be the k-th triangular number. The equation becomes \\(2\\sum_{i=1}^4 T_{k_i} + k_5^2 = 505\\).\nSince each \\(T_k\\) is an integer, the sum \\(2\\sum T_{k_i}\\) is even. For the total sum to be the odd number 505, \\(k_5^2\\) must be odd, which implies \\(k_5\\) must be odd. Let \\(k_5 = 2m+1\\) for \\(m \\ge 0\\).\nThen \\(k_5^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 4m^2+4m+1 = 4m(m+1)+1 = 8T_m+1\\).\nSubstituting this back:\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^4 k_i(k_i+1) + 4m(m+1)+1 = 505\\)\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^4 k_i(k_i+1) + 4m(m+1) = 504\\)\nDividing by 2 gives:\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^4 T_{k_i} + 4T_m = 252\\)\n\nWe can find the number of solutions to this equation by summing over the possible values of \\(m\\). A known theorem states that the number of ways to write an integer \\(n\\) as the sum of four triangular numbers, \\(N_4^T(n)\\), is given by the sum of its divisors, \\(\\sigma_1(2n+1)\\). The number of solutions for a given \\(m\\) is \\(N_4^T(252 - 4T_m)\\).\n\nWe sum the number of solutions for each \\(m\\) from 0 up to 10 (as for \\(m=11\\), \\(4T_{11} > 252\\)):\n*   m=0: \\(T_0=0\\). We need \\(N_4^T(252) = \\sigma_1(505) = \\sigma_1(5 \\cdot 101) = (1+5)(1+101) = 6 \\cdot 102 = 612\\).\n*   m=1: \\(T_1=1\\). We need \\(N_4^T(248) = \\sigma_1(497) = \\sigma_1(7 \\cdot 71) = (1+7)(1+71) = 8 \\cdot 72 = 576\\).\n*   m=2: \\(T_2=3\\). We need \\(N_4^T(240) = \\sigma_1(481) = \\sigma_1(13 \\cdot 37) = (1+13)(1+37) = 14 \\cdot 38 = 532\\).\n*   m=3: \\(T_3=6\\). We need \\(N_4^T(228) = \\sigma_1(457) = 458\\) (since 457 is prime).\n*   m=4: \\(T_4=10\\). We need \\(N_4^T(212) = \\sigma_1(425) = \\sigma_1(5^2 \\cdot 17) = \\frac{5^3-1}{4}(1+17) = 31 \\cdot 18 = 558\\).\n*   m=5: \\(T_5=15\\). We need \\(N_4^T(192) = \\sigma_1(385) = \\sigma_1(5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11) = 6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 12 = 576\\).\n*   m=6: \\(T_6=21\\). We need \\(N_4^T(168) = \\sigma_1(337) = 338\\) (since 337 is prime).\n*   m=7: \\(T_7=28\\). We need \\(N_4^T(140) = \\sigma_1(281) = 282\\) (since 281 is prime).\n*   m=8: \\(T_8=36\\). We need \\(N_4^T(108) = \\sigma_1(217) = \\sigma_1(7 \\cdot 31) = 8 \\cdot 32 = 256\\).\n*   m=9: \\(T_9=45\\). We need \\(N_4^T(68) = \\sigma_1(137) = 138\\) (since 137 is prime).\n*   m=10: \\(T_{10}=55\\). We need \\(N_4^T(32) = \\sigma_1(65) = \\sigma_1(5 \\cdot 13) = 6 \\cdot 14 = 84\\).\n\nSumming these values gives the total number of solutions for a fixed even variable:\n\\(612 + 576 + 532 + 458 + 558 + 576 + 338 + 282 + 256 + 138 + 84 = 4410\\).\nSince any of the five variables can be the even one, we multiply this by 5:\n\\(5 \\times 4410 = 22050\\).\n\n**Total Number of Solutions**\nThe total number of non-negative integer solutions is the sum of the counts from both cases:\nTotal Solutions = (Solutions from Case 1) + (Solutions from Case 2)\nTotal Solutions = \\(4980 + 22050 = 27030\\).\n\n"
