    "The problem asks for the computation of $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Space X\n\nA lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be represented by a basis of two linearly independent vectors, which form the columns of a matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The \"nondegenerate\" condition implies the vectors are linearly independent, so the matrix is invertible.\n\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The \"unit area\" condition restricts us to matrices where $|\\det(A)| = 1$. The standard convention for the moduli space of lattices is to consider *oriented* lattices, which means we take $\\det(A) = 1$. These matrices form the special linear group $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nTwo different bases define the same lattice if they are related by a matrix in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Thus, the space of oriented, unit-area lattices is the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe term \"moduli space\" in this context usually implies that lattices that are related by a rotation are considered equivalent. This corresponds to taking the quotient of the space of lattices by the action of the special orthogonal group $SO(2)$. Therefore, the space $X$ is given by the double quotient:\n\n$X = SO(2) \\backslash SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nThis space is a well-known object in mathematics. The quotient $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SO(2)$ is identified with the hyperbolic upper-half plane, $\\mathbb{H}^2$. The action of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ then descends to an action on $\\mathbb{H}^2$. The group that acts effectively on $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is the modular group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) / \\{\\pm I\\}$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nSo, the moduli space $X$ is homeomorphic to the modular surface:\n\n$X \\cong \\mathbb{H}^2 / PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nThis is technically an orbifold, due to the presence of points with non-trivial stabilizers (the elliptic points).\n\n### 2. Computing the First Homology Group\n\nThe first homology group of a path-connected space (or orbifold) $M$ with integer coefficients, $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the abelianization of its fundamental group (or orbifold fundamental group), $\\pi_1(M)$.\n\n$H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(M)^{\\text{ab}} = \\pi_1(M) / [\\pi_1(M), \\pi_1(M)]$\n\nThe hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is the universal cover of the modular surface $X$. Therefore, the orbifold fundamental group of $X$ is the group of deck transformations, which is precisely $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the abelianization of the modular group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### 3. Abelianization of PSL(2, Z)\n\nThe group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is famously known to be isomorphic to the free product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 3. It has the presentation:\n\n$PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = 1, b^3 = 1 \\rangle \\cong C_2 * C_3$\n\nThe abelianization of a free product of two groups, $G_1 * G_2$, is the direct product of their abelianizations:\n\n$(G_1 * G_2)^{\\text{ab}} \\cong G_1^{\\text{ab}} \\times G_2^{\\text{ab}}$\n\nIn this case, $G_1 = C_2$ and $G_2 = C_3$. Since both groups are already abelian, their abelianizations are the groups themselves:\n\n$C_2^{\\text{ab}} = C_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$C_3^{\\text{ab}} = C_3 = \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nTherefore, the abelianization of $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is:\n\n$(PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))^{\\text{ab}} \\cong C_2 \\times C_3$\n\nThis direct product of cyclic groups of coprime order is itself a cyclic group of order $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\n$C_2 \\times C_3 \\cong C_6 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThus, the first homology group of $X$ is the cyclic group of order 6. This result is confirmed in the literature, where the abelianization of $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$, and since $PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z}) = SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})/\\langle -I \\rangle$, its abelianization is $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$>>>"
