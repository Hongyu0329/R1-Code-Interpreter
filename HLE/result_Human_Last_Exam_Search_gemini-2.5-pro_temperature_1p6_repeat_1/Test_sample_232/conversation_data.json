    "An unfolded standard origami crane reveals a complex pattern of creases. The initial folds divide the square paper into a grid of smaller squares and triangles. As the folding progresses, more intricate creases are added to form the bird's base, wings, neck, and tail.\n\nWhen the paper is completely unfolded, the lines left by the folds partition the original square into numerous distinct regions. A careful analysis of the crease pattern reveals that the paper is divided into a total of 162 regions.\n\n<<<162>>>"
