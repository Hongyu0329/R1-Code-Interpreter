    "Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the thinker who decomposed the general concept of a sign into categories including symptoms and signals.\n\nIn his work on language and semiotics, Ajdukiewicz explored how signs function and convey meaning. According to his analysis, an \"indication,\" which he explicitly equates with a \"symptom,\" is a natural sign where one state of affairs points to another. For instance, a falling barometer is an indication or symptom of impending rain.\n\nDistinct from this, Ajdukiewicz defined a \"signal\" as an artificially created sign. A signal's meaning is established by convention and is intended to provoke a particular conclusion or action. For example, a specific sound might be a pre-arranged signal for a meeting to begin.\n\nAjdukiewicz considered both indications (symptoms) and signals to fall under the broader category of \"signs.\" His work in this area was part of the Lviv-Warsaw School's broader focus on the logic of language and the clarification of philosophical concepts.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
