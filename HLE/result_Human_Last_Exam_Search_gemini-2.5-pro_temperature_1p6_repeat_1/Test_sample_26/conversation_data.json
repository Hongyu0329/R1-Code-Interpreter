    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we will analyze its topological properties using standard results from algebraic geometry and topology.\n\nFirst, let's identify the nature of the space $X$. A quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the zero locus of a degree 5 homogeneous polynomial. It is a complex surface, which corresponds to a 4-dimensional real manifold.\n\n**1. Connectivity and Homology Groups**\nBy the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy and homology groups below a certain dimension. Specifically:\n*   $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. Thus, $X$ is simply connected.\n*   $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, as it is the abelianization of the trivial group $\\pi_1(X)$.\n*   Since $X$ is a 4-dimensional, compact, orientable manifold, we can use Poincaré duality: $H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^{4-k}(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   This implies $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. By the universal coefficient theorem, $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\operatorname{Ext}(H_0(X, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_1(X)=0$ and $H_0(X)=\\mathbb{Z}$ (for a connected space), $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial. Therefore, the third Betti number $b_3(X)$ is 0.\n\n**2. Second Betti Number**\nTo find the second Betti number, $b_2(X)$, we compute the topological Euler characteristic, $\\chi(X)$. For a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, a known formula for the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(X) = \\frac{1}{d} [ (1-d)^{n+1} + d(n+2) - 1]$. For our case, with $d=5$ and the ambient space being $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ (so $n=3$), this yields:\n$\\chi(X) = \\frac{1}{5}[ (1-5)^4 + 5(3+2) - 1] = \\frac{1}{5}[ (-4)^4 + 25 - 1] = \\frac{1}{5}[256 + 24] = \\frac{280}{5} = 56$.\nThere is a simpler formula for a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$: $\\chi(X) = d^3 - 4d^2 + 6d$. For $d=5$:\n$\\chi(X) = 5^3 - 4(5^2) + 6(5) = 125 - 100 + 30 = 55$.\nLet's use this value. The Euler characteristic is also defined by the Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\nWe know $b_0=1$ (connected), $b_1=0$, $b_3=0$, and by Poincaré duality $b_4=b_0=1$.\n$55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = b_2 + 2$.\nFrom this, we find that $b_2(X) = 53$.\n\n**3. Rational Homotopy and the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**\nA smooth quintic hypersurface, as a complex projective manifold, is a Kähler manifold. A fundamental result by Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan, and Sullivan states that compact Kähler manifolds are formal spaces. Formality implies that the rational homotopy type of the space is determined by its rational cohomology algebra.\n\nFor a simply connected formal space $X$, there is a formula relating the rank of the third homotopy group to the Betti numbers:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X) + \\binom{b_2(X)}{2} - \\text{dim Im} \\left( \\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\right) $$\nLet's substitute the values we have found for $X$:\n*   $b_2(X) = 53$\n*   $b_3(X) = 0$\n*   $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$, so it is a 1-dimensional space.\n*   The map $\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is given by the cup product. This map is non-trivial. For example, the square of the hyperplane class $h \\in H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is non-zero. Since the codomain $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is one-dimensional, the map must be surjective. Thus, the dimension of its image is 1.\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 0 + \\binom{53}{2} - 1 $$\n$$ \\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times (53-1)}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 \\times 26 = 1378 $$\nTherefore:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 1378 - 1 = 1377 $$\n\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1377.\n\n<<<1377>>>"
