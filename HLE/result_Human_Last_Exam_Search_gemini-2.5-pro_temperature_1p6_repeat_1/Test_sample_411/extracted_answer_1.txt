**(a)**
*   The diversity order for code **S_a** is **1**.
*   The diversity order for code **S_b** is **1**.
*   The diversity order for code **S_c** is **2**.

**(b)**
**Code S_c** provides the maximum directivity. This is because it is the only code that achieves full diversity order (2), making the communication link significantly more robust against channel fading compared to the other two codes.
