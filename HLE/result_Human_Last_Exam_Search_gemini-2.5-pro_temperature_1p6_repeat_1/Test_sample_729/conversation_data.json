    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as Q_128. Its structure is defined by the presentation <x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, y^-1xy = x^-1>. A power subgroup is a subgroup formed by taking the k-th power of every element in the group for some integer k.\n\nTo find the number of distinct power subgroups, we analyze the structure of these subgroups for different values of k.\n\n**Case 1: k is an odd integer**\nWhen k is odd, the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements of Q_128, denoted as (Q_128)^k, is the group Q_128 itself. This is because the cyclic subgroup generated by x, which is <x>, is reproduced (since k and the order of x, which is 64, are coprime), and the coset y<x> is also reproduced. Therefore, for any odd integer k, we get only one distinct power subgroup, which is Q_128.\n\n**Case 2: k is an even integer**\nWhen k is an even integer, say k = 2m, the power subgroup (Q_128)^k is a cyclic subgroup generated by a power of x. Specifically, (Q_128)^(2m) = <x^d>, where d is the greatest common divisor of 64 and 2m.\n\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way. The possible values for d are the even divisors of 64, since k is even. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. The even divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Each of these even divisors gives rise to a distinct cyclic subgroup.\n*   For k=2, we get the subgroup <x^2>.\n*   For k=4, we get the subgroup <x^4>.\n*   For k=8, we get the subgroup <x^8>.\n*   For k=16, we get the subgroup <x^16>.\n*   For k=32, we get the subgroup <x^32>.\n*   For k=64 (or k=0), we get the trivial subgroup <x^64> = {e}.\n\nThis gives us 6 distinct power subgroups for even values of k.\n\nCombining both cases, we have one power subgroup from the odd integers (Q_128 itself) and six power subgroups from the even integers (<x^2>, <x^4>, <x^8>, <x^16>, <x^32>, {e}).\n\nIn total, the number of distinct power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 is 1 + 6 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
