    "A perfluoronanocar is a hypothetical molecule where the hydrogen atoms of a nanocar have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Since \"nanocar\" refers to a class of molecules rather than a single specific structure, the number of fluorine atoms would depend on the chemical formula of the particular nanocar in question.\n\nBased on published examples of nanocar structures, we can determine the number of fluorine atoms for different versions:\n\n*   For a nanocar with the chemical formula **C430H274O12**, a perfluorinated version would hypothetically contain **274 fluorine atoms**, as each hydrogen atom would be substituted with a fluorine atom.\n*   In a computational study of a \"flexible Nanocar\" with the chemical formula **C310H34**, a perfluorinated equivalent would contain **34 fluorine atoms**.\n*   Nanocars that participated in the first Nanocar Race in 2017 were composed of a few hundred atoms in total. For example, the largest vehicle in the race had about 650 atoms in total, while the lightest had only 42. The precise number of fluorine atoms in a perfluorinated version of these would depend on their specific, unpublished chemical structures and the number of hydrogen atoms available for substitution.\n\nTherefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar can vary significantly depending on the underlying nanocar structure.\n\n<<<274>>>"
