    "The haiku, titled \"The Bays,\" provides a series of clues pointing to a significant historical event. An analysis of the lines suggests a connection to the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt.\n\nThe line \"An August tempest\" refers to a period of great turmoil during the month of August. \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" points directly to the year 30 BC, a pivotal moment in ancient history that ushered in a new era for Rome. Finally, \"A divine one yields\" alludes to the surrender of a figure who was considered a deity.\n\nBoth Cleopatra and Mark Antony meet these criteria. Cleopatra, revered as the goddess Isis, and Antony, who identified with the god Dionysus, took their own lives in Alexandria in August of 30 BC following their defeat by Octavian. Their deaths marked the end of the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt and the consolidation of Roman power under Octavian, the future emperor Augustus.\n\nThe title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is presented as a question. \"The Bays\" likely refers to the laurel wreaths, or \"bays,\" which were symbols of victory in Rome. The question can be interpreted as an ironic query about who the true subject of this momentous change is. While Octavian was the victor who would claim the laurel wreath, the haiku's focus is on the vanquished.\n\nWith two possible answers, Antony and Cleopatra, the instruction to present the answer \"in alphabetical order\" becomes the final clue. Between \"Antony\" and \"Cleopatra,\" the former comes first alphabetically.\n\n<<<Antony>>>"
