    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a chemical joke that combines the name of the car brand Mercedes-Benz with the chemical compound benzene. Its structure is typically depicted as a benzene ring with three substituents arranged to resemble the Mercedes-Benz three-pointed star logo.\n\nA benzene ring (C6H6) is a cyclic compound consisting of 6 carbon atoms and 6 hydrogen atoms. In the humorous depiction of \"mercedesbenzene,\" three of the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring, at positions 1, 3, and 5, are replaced by methyl groups (-CH3).\n\nTherefore, the total number of carbon atoms in this fictitious molecule would be:\n*   6 carbon atoms from the benzene ring\n*   3 carbon atoms from the three methyl groups (one for each group)\n\nThis gives a total of 9 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<9>>>"
