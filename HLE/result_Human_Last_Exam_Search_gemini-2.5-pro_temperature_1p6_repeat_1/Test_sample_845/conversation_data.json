    "The value between heartbeats used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **interbeat interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhen HRV is measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG), this interval is often specifically referred to as the R-R interval, which is the time between successive R-waves of the QRS complex. However, when using photoplethysmography (PPG), as mentioned in the question, the more general term \"interbeat interval\" (IBI) is used to denote the time between consecutive heartbeats. This interval is typically measured in milliseconds.\n\n<<<interbeat interval (IBI)>>>"
