For a distance-3 surface code near the 1% error threshold, implementing a universal quantum computer via standard magic state distillation is generally considered impractical due to insufficient error suppression. For a distance-5 surface code with a 1% physical error rate, the approximate number of physical non-Clifford gates required to distill one high-fidelity logical non-Clifford gate is on the order of **100 to 1,000**.
