    "The \"thickness\" of a double point in the stable reduction of a curve is a concept from the theory of arithmetic surfaces and Berkovich spaces, which quantifies the \"length\" of the tube in the corresponding Berkovich space that pinches to form the double point. For a stable curve defined over a discrete valuation ring, a double point is locally described by an equation of the form $xy = \\pi^t$, where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer of the ring. The integer $t$ is the thickness of the double point.\n\nIn the case of the curve defined by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, with the valuation $v$ normalized such that $v(2)=1$, we can analyze a simplified model to determine this thickness.\n\nLet's introduce a new variable $u = z-1$. The equation of the curve can be rewritten as:\n$(u+1)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$u^2 + 2u + 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$u^2 + 2u = 2(x^5 + x^3)$\n$u(u+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nThe special fiber of this model over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (obtained by setting coefficients divisible by 2 to zero) is given by $u^2 = 0$. This represents a non-reduced, singular line. The stable reduction process resolves this singularity into a set of smooth curves intersecting at ordinary double points.\n\nWhile a full analysis requires advanced techniques involving blowing up singular models or analyzing the clustering of the roots of the polynomial, in many cases, the thickness of a resulting double point is directly related to the valuation of the coefficients that cause the bad reduction. Here, the problematic term is the coefficient 2. A resolution of the singularities of the model often leads to a local equation for the double point where the thickness is determined by the valuation of this coefficient.\n\nFor the given curve, the thickness of the double point in its stable reduction over the 2-adic integers is equal to the valuation of the coefficient `2`. Given that the valuation is normalized such that $v(2)=1$, the thickness of the double point is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
