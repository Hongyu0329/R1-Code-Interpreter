    "An animal that might be able to hear human muscle twitches would need a hearing range that extends to the low frequencies at which these twitches occur, and would also need to be sensitive to very faint sounds.\n\nHuman muscle twitches are minor muscle contractions that can be stimulated at various frequencies. The frequency of these contractions can range from approximately 15 Hz up to 100 Hz. For instance, studies on muscle fatigue in humans have used stimulus frequencies of 15 Hz and 30 Hz. Tetanus, a sustained muscle contraction, can be induced at frequencies between 50 and 100 Hz.\n\nTo determine which of the animals listed might hear these sounds, we must examine their respective hearing ranges:\n\n*   **Humans:** The typical hearing range for a young, healthy human is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. While the frequency of muscle twitches falls within this range, the sounds they produce are generally too quiet for humans to perceive.\n*   **Dogs:** A dog's hearing range is approximately 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz. This means they could potentially hear the higher frequency muscle twitches, but like humans, the faintness of the sound may be a limiting factor.\n*   **Bats:** Bats have an exceptional hearing range, from around 1,000 Hz (1 kHz) to as high as 200,000 Hz (200 kHz). However, they are not sensitive to frequencies below 10,000 Hz, making it highly unlikely they could hear the low-frequency sounds of a muscle twitch.\n*   **Whales:** The hearing range of whales varies significantly by species. Baleen whales, for example, have a hearing range that extends as low as 7 Hz and up to 35 kHz, which would encompass the frequency of muscle twitches. Toothed whales, on the other hand, hear in the mid to high-frequency ranges (150 Hz to 160 kHz) and would not be able to hear such low frequencies.\n*   **Herring:** This fish has a very broad hearing range, from below 1 Hz to over 100,000 Hz in some cases. Their most sensitive hearing is in the range of 100 Hz to 1,500 Hz. This specific sensitivity to the lower frequency spectrum, which aligns with the frequency of muscle twitches, makes them a strong candidate for being able to detect such sounds.\n\nConsidering the options, while some whales could theoretically hear the frequencies of muscle twitches, the herring's noted sensitivity within the precise range of these sounds makes it a particularly plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
