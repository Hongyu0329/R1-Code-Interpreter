    "In Natalia Osipova's renowned 2008 performance of the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet, she did not execute any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\nChoreographic analyses of her performance, available through various video recordings from that year, reveal that the celebrated diagonal of turns in her variation consists of a series of piqué turns, a different technical element from the specified pirouettes.\n\nVideos from her guest performance in Novosibirsk, Siberia, in 2008, show her executing these piqué turns. While there are many pirouettes in the overall performance, none in the Act I variation match the description of single turns starting from the fifth position. The choreography for this particular variation can differ between productions and even between a dancer's own interpretations over time.\n\n<<<0>>>"
