    "The maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables, denoted as a(n), is given by the formula 2<sup>n-1</sup>. This formula represents the maximum number of simplified product terms that can exist in a Boolean function with n variables.\n\nFor a Boolean function with 4 variables (n=4), the maximal number of prime implicants is calculated as follows:\n\na(4) = 2<sup>(4-1)</sup> = 2<sup>3</sup> = 8.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
