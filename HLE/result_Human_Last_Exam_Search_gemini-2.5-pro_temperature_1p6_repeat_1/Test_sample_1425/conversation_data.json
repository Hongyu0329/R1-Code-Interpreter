    "In the grand canonical ensemble, the partition function Z for a system is given by the trace of the statistical operator e​<sup>−β(Ĥ−μN̂)</sup>, where β is the inverse temperature (1/k​<sub>B</sub>​T), Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator, μ is the chemical potential, and N̂ is the particle number operator. The expression is:\n\nZ = Tr [e<sup>−β(Ĥ − μN̂)</sup>]\n\nFor the specific case where the Hamiltonian is given as Ĥ = −μN̂, we substitute this into the general formula for the partition function:\n\nZ = Tr [e<sup>−β(−μN̂ − μN̂)</sup>] = Tr [e<sup>2βμN̂</sup>]\n\nTo express this partition function using path integrals, we introduce a quantum field φ(τ, **x**), which is a function of imaginary time τ and position **x**. The path integral is a sum over all possible configurations of this field. The partition function Z can be written as a functional integral over the field φ and its conjugate φ<sup>*</sup>:\n\nZ = ∫ D[φ<sup>*</sup>, φ] e<sup>−S[φ<sup>*</sup>, φ]</sup>\n\nHere, S[φ<sup>*</sup>, φ] is the Euclidean action of the system. The general form of the Euclidean action in the grand canonical ensemble for a system described by a Hamiltonian H and chemical potential μ is:\n\nS[φ<sup>*</sup>, φ] = ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ φ<sup>*</sup>(∂<sub>τ</sub> − μ)φ + H(φ<sup>*</sup>, φ) ]\n\nwhere d is the spatial dimension and H(φ<sup>*</sup>, φ) is the Hamiltonian expressed as a functional of the fields.\n\nIn this particular problem, the Hamiltonian is H = -μN. The particle number operator N̂, in terms of the quantum fields, is given by N̂ = ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x φ<sup>*</sup>φ. Therefore, the Hamiltonian functional is:\n\nH(φ<sup>*</sup>, φ) = -μ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x φ<sup>*</sup>φ\n\nNow, we substitute this Hamiltonian into the expression for the action:\n\nS[φ<sup>*</sup>, φ] = ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ φ<sup>*</sup>(∂<sub>τ</sub> − μ)φ − μ(φ<sup>*</sup>φ) ]\n\nCombining the terms involving the chemical potential, we get:\n\nS[φ<sup>*</sup>, φ] = ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ φ<sup>*</sup>(∂<sub>τ</sub> − 2μ)φ ]\n\nFinally, substituting this action back into the path integral expression for Z, we obtain the partition function for the given system.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^dx \\, \\phi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})\\right)}$.\n\nThis expression holds for both bosonic and fermionic systems. The distinction between them lies in the nature of the fields and their boundary conditions:\n*   For **bosons**, φ and φ<sup>*</sup> are complex-valued fields, and they must satisfy periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: φ(τ=0, **x**) = φ(τ=β, **x**).\n*   For **fermions**, φ and φ<sup>*</sup> are Grassmann-valued (anti-commuting) fields, and they must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: φ(τ=0, **x**) = -φ(τ=β, **x**).\n\n<<<>>>The partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian Ĥ = −μN̂ in the grand canonical ensemble, expressed using path integrals, is given by:\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^dx \\, \\phi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})\\right)$\n\nHere:\n*   β is the inverse temperature (1/k<sub>B</sub>T).\n*   μ is the chemical potential.\n*   φ(τ, **x**) and φ<sup>*</sup>(τ, **x**) are the quantum fields, which are functions of imaginary time τ and spatial coordinates **x**.\n*   ∫ D[φ<sup>*</sup>, φ] represents the functional integral over all possible field configurations.\n*   The integral ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ is over imaginary time from 0 to β.\n*   The fields must satisfy boundary conditions in imaginary time depending on the particle statistics:\n    *   **Bosonic fields**: Periodic boundary conditions, φ(0, **x**) = φ(β, **x**).\n    *   **Fermionic fields**: Anti-periodic boundary conditions, φ(0, **x**) = -φ(β, **x**)."
