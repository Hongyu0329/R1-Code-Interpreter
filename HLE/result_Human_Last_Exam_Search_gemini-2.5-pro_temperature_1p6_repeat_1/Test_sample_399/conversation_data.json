    "To solve the initial value problem, we first identify the differential equation as separable.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$\n\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$\n\nNow, we separate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\n$\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt$\n\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation:\n$\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt$\n\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nWe use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of C. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n$-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$\n$\\frac{1}{8} = C$\n\nNow, substitute the value of C back into the equation to get the particular solution:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTo find an explicit expression for $x(t)$, we can multiply by -1 and then take the reciprocal:\n$\\frac{1}{x} = -(\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8})$\n$\\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTo simplify the right side, we find a common denominator:\n$\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}{8}$\n\nNow, we solve for $x(t)$:\n$x(t) = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}$\n\nFinally, we need to find $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into the expression for $x(t)$:\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1)^2 + 8(1) - 1}$\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4 + 8 - 1}$\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
