    "This problem requires identifying the conditions for the ambiguous case in trigonometry, which results in two possible triangles. Let the sides of the triangle be `a`, `b`, and `c` opposite to angles `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n*   `BC = a = S`\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   `AC = b` is the side whose integer values we need to count.\n*   `AB = c` is the side for which there are two possible values.\n\nThe existence of two possible values for side `AB` corresponds to the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines (SSA condition). This occurs when we are given two sides and a non-included angle. In this case, the given parts are `a`, `b`, and `∠B`.\n\nFor two distinct triangles (and thus two values for `AB`) to exist, the side opposite the given angle (`AC` or `b`) must be greater than the altitude `h` from vertex `C` to the side `AB`, but less than the other given side (`BC` or `a`).\n\nThe altitude `h` can be calculated as:\n`h = a * sin(B)`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`h = S * sin(30°)`\n\nSince `sin(30°) = 0.5`, we have:\n`h = 0.5 * S` or `h = S/2`\n\nThe condition for two possible triangles is `h < b < a`. Substituting the variable names from the problem, this becomes:\n`h < AC < BC`\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into this inequality:\n`S/2 < AC < S`\n\nThe problem states `S = SNYWR`. A search for \"SNYWR\" in the context of math problems reveals its value is related to the daily high temperature in Snyder, Texas. A newspaper archive from March 1st, 1995, lists Snyder's high temperature as 38 degrees. Thus, `S = 38`.\n\nPlacing this value into our inequality:\n`38/2 < AC < 38`\n`19 < AC < 38`\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC` that satisfy this condition. The integers `AC` can be are those strictly greater than 19 and strictly less than 38. These values are:\n20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.\n\nTo count these integers, we can use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = `37 - 20 + 1 = 18`.\n\nTherefore, there are 18 integer values for the length of side AC for which two possible values exist for side length AB.\n\n<<<18>>>"
