    "I am unable to provide the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle. I have identified the most likely source for this information, a comprehensive database of circle packings known as \"packomania.com\" by Eckard Specht. This resource is repeatedly referenced as containing the best-known packings and their properties, including the symmetry group in Schoenflies notation, for a large number of circles. However, my search tools are unable to parse the extensive data tables on the website to retrieve the specific entry for N=1135. Without access to this specific data point, I cannot fulfill your request."
