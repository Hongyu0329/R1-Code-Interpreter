    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic integers has **two** double points (nodes).\n\nHere is a summary of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Simplifying the Model:** The given equation is a model for a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. To analyze its reduction modulo 2, it is helpful to find a \"minimal\" model. A coordinate transformation with $x_1 = 2x$ and $y_1 = 2y$ transforms the original equation into an equivalent model:\n    $y_1^2 = x_1^5 + x_1^4 + 2x_1^3 + x_1^2 + 16x_1$. This model is minimal in the sense that its discriminant has the lowest possible 2-adic valuation.\n\n2.  **Reduction Modulo 2:** The reduction of this minimal model modulo 2 is obtained by setting all coefficients that are multiples of 2 to zero:\n    $y_1^2 \\equiv x_1^5 + x_1^4 + x_1^2 \\pmod{2}$, which can be factored as $y_1^2 \\equiv x_1^2(x_1^3 + x_1^2 + 1)$.\n    The polynomial $x_1^3 + x_1^2 + 1$ is irreducible over the field with two elements, $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The reduced curve is therefore an irreducible curve with a singularity.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Singularity:** The singularity of the reduced curve $y_1^2 = x_1^2(x_1^3+x_1^2+1)$ occurs at the point $(0,0)$. At this point, the curve behaves like $y_1^2 = x_1^2$, which in characteristic 2 is equivalent to $(y_1-x_1)^2=0$. This type of singularity is a cusp.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Stable Reduction:** The theory of stable reduction states that the stable model of the curve is found by resolving the singularities of a regular model. When the special fiber of a minimal regular model of a genus 2 curve is an irreducible curve whose normalization is an elliptic curve (as is the case here), the stable reduction is composed of two components: one rational curve (genus 0) and one elliptic curve (genus 1).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Genus:** The arithmetic genus of a stable curve must be conserved. For a stable curve with multiple components, the genus is calculated by the formula:\n    $g = \\sum g_i + N - c + 1$, where $g_i$ are the genera of the components, $N$ is the total number of double points (nodes) where components intersect, and $c$ is the number of components.\n    In our case, the genus of the original curve is $g=2$. We have two components ($c=2$), one of genus $g_1=0$ and one of genus $g_2=1$. Plugging these values into the formula:\n    $2 = 0 + 1 + N - 2 + 1$\n    $2 = N$\n\nTherefore, the two components must intersect at two points, resulting in two double points in the stable reduction.\n\n"
