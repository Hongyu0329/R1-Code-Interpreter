    "The battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler that occurred latest historically is the Charge at Huj, which took place on November 8, 1917, during the First World War. This engagement was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign.\n\nLady Butler, a renowned British painter of military scenes, captured this event in her work titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*. This particular action is notable for being one of the last classic, unsupported cavalry charges in British military history. The charge was against a rearguard position of German, Austrian, and Turkish troops.\n\nWhile Lady Butler depicted numerous historical battles throughout her career, her works on World War I represent the latest conflicts she painted. Among these, the Charge at Huj is the latest dated battle found. Other World War I battles she depicted include:\n*   The Retreat from Mons (1914)\n*   The Battle of Loos (1915)\n*   The Battle of Agagia (February 26, 1916)\n\nThe Charge at Huj in November 1917 is, therefore, the latest historical battle she portrayed.\n\n<<<The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj>>>"
