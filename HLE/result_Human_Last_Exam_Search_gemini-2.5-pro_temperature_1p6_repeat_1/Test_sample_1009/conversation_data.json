    "To determine the largest possible weight of a compact, first-countable topological group $G$ of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$, we first need to establish some fundamental properties and relationships between the cardinality, weight, and other cardinal invariants of topological groups.\n\n### Definitions and Basic Properties\n*   **Topological Group (G):** A group equipped with a topology such that the group multiplication and inversion operations are continuous.\n*   **Compact (G):** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-Countable (G):** There is a countable local basis of neighborhoods at each point. For a topological group, this is equivalent to having a countable local basis at the identity element, $e$. We denote this property by $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality (|G|):** The number of elements in the group, given as $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Here, $\\frak c$ stands for the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   **Weight (w(G)):** The minimum cardinality of a basis for the topology of G.\n*   **Hausdorff Property:** A topological space is Hausdorff (or T$_2$) if for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ is a closed set.\n\n### Analysis of the Hausdorff Condition\nFirst, let's consider if the group G can be Hausdorff. For a compact Hausdorff group G, there are several key theorems:\n1.  A compact Hausdorff group G that is first-countable has a weight equal to its character: $w(G) = \\chi(G)$.\n2.  For a compact Hausdorff, first-countable space G, the cardinality is bounded by $|G| \\le 2^{\\chi(G)}$.\n\nGiven that G is first-countable, we have $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. If G were Hausdorff, its weight would be $w(G) = \\aleph_0$. The cardinality would be bounded by $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\nHowever, the problem states that the cardinality of G is $2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is vastly larger than $\\frak c$. This demonstrates that **G cannot be a Hausdorff group**. The non-Hausdorff property is therefore a crucial part of the problem.\n\n### Properties of Non-Hausdorff Topological Groups\nIn a non-Hausdorff topological group, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a non-trivial closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group. Let's analyze its properties:\n*   **$G/N$ is compact:** As the continuous image of a compact space G under the quotient map, $G/N$ is compact.\n*   **$G/N$ is first-countable:** Since the quotient map $p: G \\to G/N$ is open and G is first-countable, $G/N$ is also first-countable.\n*   **$G/N$ is Hausdorff:** The quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity is always a Hausdorff group.\n\nSo, $G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. From our earlier analysis, we know that $|G/N| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nThe cardinality of G is the product of the cardinalities of N and $G/N$: $|G| = |N| \\cdot |G/N|$.\nGiven $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ and $|G/N| \\le \\frak c$, we must have $|N| = |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n### Upper Bound on the Weight\nLet's establish an upper bound for the weight of G.\nSince G is a first-countable group, there exists a countable local basis at the identity, $\\{U_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nA basis for the entire topology of G can be formed by the collection of all left translates of these basic neighborhoods: $\\mathcal{B} = \\{gU_n : g \\in G, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nThe cardinality of this basis is at most $|\\mathcal{B}| \\le |G| \\cdot \\aleph_0$. Since $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ is an infinite cardinal, $|G| \\cdot \\aleph_0 = |G|$.\nThus, we have an upper bound for the weight: $w(G) \\le |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n### The Question of the Largest Possible Weight\nThe main question is whether this upper bound can be achieved. We need to determine if there can exist a group with the given properties and a weight equal to its cardinality.\n\nFor any topological group G, it is a known theorem by Vladimir Uspenskij that its weight is the product of its density and its character: $w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n*   **Density (d(G)):** The minimum cardinality of a dense subset of G.\n\nSince G is first-countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. So, $w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\aleph_0$.\nThe weight being equal to the cardinality, $w(G) = |G|$, is therefore equivalent to having the density equal to the cardinality, $d(G) = |G|$. This means that G cannot have any proper dense subgroups. The discrete topology is an example of a topology where $d(G)=|G|$, but a group with the discrete topology is compact only if it is finite.\n\nThe crucial point is that while compactness imposes strong constraints on Hausdorff groups, these constraints are significantly relaxed for non-Hausdorff groups. The cardinal inequality $|G| \\le 2^{c(G)\\chi(G)}$ (where $c(G)$ is the cellularity), which holds for Hausdorff groups and would have limited the cardinality of G to $2^{\\frak c}$, does not hold for all non-Hausdorff groups. The existence of a group with the given large cardinality confirms this.\n\nWhile constructions of compact, first-countable, non-Hausdorff groups often lead to examples with small weight (e.g., by taking a product of a compact Hausdorff group with a group equipped with the indiscrete topology, which results in a weight of $\\aleph_0$), these constructions do not preclude the existence of examples with a large weight.\n\nThe problem asks for the *largest possible* weight. Given the established upper bound $w(G) \\le |G|$, and the absence of any theorem that would impose a smaller limit on the weight for a non-Hausdorff group with these properties, the largest possible weight is this upper bound. The existence of a compact, first-countable group $G$ with density $d(G)=|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$ is considered possible within the axioms of ZFC, as it does not contradict any known theorems for non-Hausdorff topological groups. Such a group would satisfy $w(G) = d(G)\\chi(G) = |G|\\aleph_0 = |G|$.\n\nThus, the largest possible weight of the group G is its cardinality.\n\n<<<2^{2^{\\frak c}}>>>"
