    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002, a status it continues to hold.** Its extreme rarity is a consequence of its radioactive nature.\n\nOf the naturally occurring noble gases—helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon—radon is the least abundant. Its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.82 days. While it is continuously generated in the Earth's crust through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, its rapid decay means that only a minuscule amount exists at any given time. The abundance of radon in the Earth's crust is estimated to be about 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram.\n\nIn contrast, the next rarest noble gas, xenon, is considerably more abundant. Although often described as extremely rare, xenon is a stable element. Its concentration in the Earth's atmosphere is about 0.087 parts per million by volume, which equates to a total atmospheric mass of approximately 2.03 gigatonnes. There is a scientific discussion known as the \"missing xenon problem,\" which posits that a significant amount of xenon may be trapped within minerals in the Earth's crust and mantle. However, even if this \"missing\" xenon were to be fully accounted for, its overall abundance would still be significantly greater than that of radon.\n\nThe specific year of 2002 does not alter this conclusion, as the terrestrial abundances of these elements do not change on such short timescales. While the synthetic element Oganesson is technically a noble gas and even rarer, it does not occur naturally and is therefore not considered part of Earth's terrestrial matter in this context.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
