    "An analysis of Academy Award for Best Picture winners reveals that *Gigi*, the 1958 recipient of the prestigious award, is the first to feature the Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\nPrevious winners set in Paris, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) and *An American in Paris* (1951), were primarily filmed on studio backlots with constructed sets representing the French capital. While *An American in Paris* includes a scene suggesting the Place de la Concorde, it is an artistic recreation and does not feature the actual landmark. In contrast, *The Life of Emile Zola* utilized numerous sets to depict 19th-century Paris, but there is no evidence of the Luxor Obelisk being among them.\n\nThe 1958 musical *Gigi* was partially filmed on location in Paris, and includes scenes set in the Place de la Concorde. In a notable scene, the fountain at the Place de la Concorde is prominently featured at night, and this setting provides a backdrop that includes the historic Luxor Obelisk. One review of the film explicitly mentions the thrill of seeing \"the fountain in the Place de la Concorde at night\" when watching *Gigi*.\n\nTherefore, based on filming locations and scene descriptions, *Gigi* stands as the first Best Picture winner to depict the authentic Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<Gigi>>>"
