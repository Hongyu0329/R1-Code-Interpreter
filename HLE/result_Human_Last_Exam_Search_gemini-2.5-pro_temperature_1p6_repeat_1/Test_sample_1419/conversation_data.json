    "In the context of the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is determined by the one-loop beta function in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions.\n\nThe Lagrangian for the single-component scalar field (ϕ⁴) theory is typically written with an interaction term of the form:\n\nL_int = - (g/4!) * ϕ⁴\n\nHere, 'g' is the coupling constant. The behavior of this coupling constant under changes in energy scale is described by the beta function, β(g). To the leading order in both the coupling constant and ϵ, the beta function in the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme is:\n\nβ(g) = -ϵg + (3g²)/(16π²)\n\nThe fixed points of the theory are the values of the coupling g* for which the beta function is zero, i.e., β(g*) = 0. This indicates that the coupling constant no longer changes with the energy scale.\nSetting the beta function to zero yields two possible fixed points:\n\n-ϵg* + (3(g*)²)/(16π²) = 0\ng*(-ϵ + 3g*/(16π²)) = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  The Gaussian fixed point: g* = 0, which corresponds to a free, non-interacting theory.\n2.  The Wilson-Fisher fixed point: -ϵ + 3g*/(16π²) = 0\n\nSolving for the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point gives the leading order expression for the coupling in terms of ϵ:\n\ng* = (16π²/3) * ϵ\n\nThis fixed point is what governs the universal critical behavior of systems in the same universality class as the ϕ⁴ theory, such as the Ising model near its critical temperature.\n\nIt is important to note that the numerical prefactor depends on the normalization chosen for the coupling constant. The expression provided here is based on the widely used convention with the g/4! factor in the Lagrangian. Different definitions of the coupling constant will result in a different prefactor for ϵ, though the linear dependence on ϵ is a universal feature at this order.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3) * ϵ>>>"
