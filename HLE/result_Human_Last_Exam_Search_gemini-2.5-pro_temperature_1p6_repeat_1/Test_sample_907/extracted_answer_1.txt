Here is a theoretical derivation of the absorption cross-section for a chain of molecules, considering transitions from electronic states below the Fermi level, under the influence of an ultrashort Gaussian-shaped laser pulse. The framework used is the first-order time-dependent perturbation theory.

The interaction between the laser pulse and the molecules is described by the semi-classical Hamiltonian H'(t) = -**d** ⋅ **E**(t), where **d** is the electric dipole operator and **E**(t) is the electric field of the laser. For an ultrashort Gaussian pulse with a central angular frequency ω₀ and a temporal duration characterized by τ, the electric field can be written as:

**E**(t) = **E**₀ * exp(-t²/τ²) * cos(ω₀t)

Within the first-order time-dependent perturbation theory, the absorption cross-section σ(ω) at a frequency ω is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment between the initial state |i⟩ and the final state |f⟩, and to the spectral intensity of the pulse at the transition frequency ω<sub>fi</sub> = (E<sub>f</sub> - E<sub>i</sub>)/ħ. The ultrashort nature of the pulse implies a broad frequency spectrum, meaning a range of transitions can be induced. The delta function for energy conservation in Fermi's Golden Rule is effectively replaced by the Gaussian spectral profile of the laser pulse.

The general form of the absorption cross-section is:
σ(ω) ∝ ω * Σ<sub>i,f</sub> |**μ**<sub>fi</sub>|² * g<sub>pulse</sub>(ω - ω<sub>fi</sub>)
where **μ**<sub>fi</sub> is the transition dipole moment ⟨f|**d**|i⟩, and g<sub>pulse</sub> is the Gaussian spectral lineshape imposed by the laser pulse. The summation is over all possible initial states |i⟩ below the Fermi level and final states |f⟩ above it.

### a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.

In this scenario, the molecular chain is treated as an assembly of *N* identical, non-interacting molecules. The electronic states of the system are simply the localized molecular orbitals (MOs) of the individual molecules. An electronic transition occurs from an occupied MO of a single molecule to an unoccupied MO of the same molecule.

The initial states |i⟩ are the occupied MOs |φ<sub>j</sub>⟩ with energies ε<sub>j</sub> below the Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>). The final states |f⟩ are the unoccupied MOs |φ<sub>k</sub>⟩ with energies ε<sub>k</sub> above the Fermi level.

The absorption cross-section for the entire chain, σ<sub>a</sub>(ω), is the sum of the cross-sections of the individual molecules, which, since they are identical, becomes *N* times the cross-section of a single molecule.

The equation for the absorption cross-section is:
**σ<sub>a</sub>(ω) = C ⋅ N ⋅ ω ⋅ Σ<sub>j (ε<sub>j</sub><E<sub>F</sub>)</sub> Σ<sub>k (ε<sub>k</sub>>E<sub>F</sub>)</sub> |**μ**<sub>kj</sub>|² ⋅ exp[ - (ω - ω<sub>kj</sub>)²τ² / 2 ]**

Where:
*   **C** is a proportionality constant that includes fundamental physical constants.
*   **N** is the number of molecules in the chain.
*   **ω** is the angular frequency of the absorbed light.
*   The summations run over all occupied molecular orbitals *j* (with energy ε<sub>j</sub> < E<sub>F</sub>) and all unoccupied molecular orbitals *k* (with energy ε<sub>k</sub> > E<sub>F</sub>).
*   **μ**<sub>kj</sub> = ⟨φ<sub>k</sub>|**d**|φ<sub>j</sub>⟩ represents the transition dipole moment for a single molecule between orbital *j* and orbital *k*.
*   **ω<sub>kj</sub>** = (ε<sub>k</sub> - ε<sub>j</sub>)/ħ is the corresponding transition frequency.
*   **τ** characterizes the duration of the Gaussian pulse (related to its Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM). The exponential term represents the Gaussian spectra
