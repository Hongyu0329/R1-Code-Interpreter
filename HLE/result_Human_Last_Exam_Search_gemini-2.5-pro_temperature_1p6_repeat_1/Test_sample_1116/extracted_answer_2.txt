The new spot is 2-(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-8-(3,5-dibromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione. No, the structure should be the symmetrical dibromide with an extra bromine on one of the 3-positions. So it is 2-(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-8-(3,5-dibromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl) isn't correct. It's more likely 2,8-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl) gets brominated again. The product is likely a tribromo-substituted product where two bromines are on the 5-positions of the terminal thiophenes, and the third bromine is on a 3-position of one of the terminal thiophenes.
