The final state of the system is one of five possible entangled states, with the most likely outcome (30% probability) being the measurement of ququint A in the state $ |2\rangle_A $, causing the system to collapse to the state $ |2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B) $.
