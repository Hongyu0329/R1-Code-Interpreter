    "Minh General Mưu Thạnh experienced his first major defeat in what is now the province of Lạng Sơn in Vietnam. This occurred during the Battle of Chi Lăng in 1427.\n\nThe Battle of Chi Lăng, a pivotal event in the Lam Sơn uprising, resulted in a decisive victory for the Vietnamese forces led by Lê Lợi. The battle took place at the Chi Lăng Pass in the modern-day Chi Lăng District of Lạng Sơn Province. While General Liu Sheng was the commander of the Ming army and was killed in the engagement, Mu Sheng was also a general in the Ming forces that were defeated. The victory at Chi Lăng was a significant turning point, contributing to the eventual withdrawal of Ming forces from Vietnam.\n\n<<<Lạng Sơn Province>>>"
