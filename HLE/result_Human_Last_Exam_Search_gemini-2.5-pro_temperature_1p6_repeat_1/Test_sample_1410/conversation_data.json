    "In the given chess position, represented by the FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`, White has a decisive advantage and can force a checkmate. Assuming optimal play from both sides, White can win in 4 moves.\n\nThe critical move for White is to capture the Black rook on e1 with the White rook from f1 (Rxe1+). This move initiates a forcing sequence that leads to checkmate. The line of play is as follows:\n\n1.  **Rxe1+** Black's only legal move is to recapture with the queen.\n2.  **Qxe1+** White recaptures the queen. Black's king is forced to h7.\n3.  **Qxe1 Kh7** White continues the attack by moving the queen to f2.\n4.  **Qf2** This sets up the final move.\n5.  **Qf7#** results in a checkmate.\n\nTherefore, with optimal play, White can achieve victory in 4 moves.\n\n<<<4>>>"
