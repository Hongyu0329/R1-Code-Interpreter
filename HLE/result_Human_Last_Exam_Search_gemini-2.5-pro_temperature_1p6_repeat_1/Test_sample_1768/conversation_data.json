    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that is read to produce a protein, starting with a start codon and ending with a stop codon. Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, we would not expect to find any stop codons within the correct reading frame. The genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides, called codons, and a given DNA sequence has three possible reading frames.\n\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nLet's translate this sequence in all three reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga gcg act gga gaa gtg gc`\n    *   This frame contains multiple stop codons (`tag`, `taa`, `tga`).

Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame should not contain any stop codons. The genetic code is read in triplets, meaning there are three possible reading frames for a given sequence.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence provided is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nBy translating this sequence in all three possible reading frames, we can determine the correct one:\n\n*   **Reading Frame 1** begins with the first nucleotide (`g`):\n    `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga gcg act gga gaa gtg gc`\n    This translation results in several stop codons (`tag`, `taa`, `tga`), so it is not the correct frame.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 2** begins with the second nucleotide (`g`):\n    `g gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\n    The resulting protein sequence is: **DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSLYPTPNNLNSVLAERLEKW**\n    This reading frame contains no stop codons.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 3** begins with the third nucleotide (`a`):\n    `gg aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ctg agc gac tgg aga agt ggc`\n    This translation also results in stop codons (`tga`), indicating it is not the correct frame.\n\nTherefore, the correct reading frame is the second one.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSLYPTPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSLYPTPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
