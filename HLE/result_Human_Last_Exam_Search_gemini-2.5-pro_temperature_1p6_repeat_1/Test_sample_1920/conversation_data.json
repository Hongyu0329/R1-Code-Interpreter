    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor**\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nWe can test for small prime divisors:\n$53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n$7657 \\div 13 = 589$\n$589 \\div 19 = 31$\nThus, the prime factorization of $d$ is:\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$\n\n**2. Structure of Primitive Characters**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is primitive. It can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters with prime conductors:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$\nwhere $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$. For $\\chi$ to be primitive, each component $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character modulo $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is non-principal, which means its order must be greater than 1.\n\nThe four primes are $p_1 = 7$, $p_2 = 13$, $p_3 = 19$, and $p_4 = 31$.\n\n**3. Order of the Character**\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6.\n\nLet $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. The condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$ implies that each order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal, its order $o_i$ must be greater than 1. Therefore, the possible orders for each $o_i$ are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**4. Number of Characters for Each Component**\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $\\phi(p)$.\n\nWe must check if the orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible for each prime component:\n*   For $p_1 = 7$, $\\phi(7) = 6$. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6. The required orders {2, 3, 6} are all possible.\n*   For $p_2 = 13$, $\\phi(13) = 12$. The required orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 12.\n*   For $p_3 = 19$, $\\phi(19) = 18$. The required orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 18.\n*   For $p_4 = 31$, $\\phi(31) = 30$. The required orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 30.\n\nFor each of the four prime components, the number of available non-principal characters of orders dividing 6 is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n**5. Counting the Total Number of Characters**\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of characters with order exactly 6. Let $N(k)$ be the number of primitive characters $\\chi$ such that the order of $\\chi$ divides $k$. A character's order divides $k$ if and only if the order of each of its components $\\chi_i$ divides $k$.\n\n*   **$N(1)$**: This requires $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ to divide 1 for each $i$. This means $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)=1$, which corresponds to the principal character. Since we require non-principal characters, $N(1)=0$.\n\n*   **$N(2)$**: This requires $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ to divide 2 for each $i$. Since $o_i > 1$, we must have $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)=2$. The number of characters of order 2 for each component is $\\phi(2)=1$. Thus, $N(2) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **$N(3)$**: This requires $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ to divide 3 for each $i$. Since $o_i > 1$, we must have $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)=3$. The number of characters of order 3 for each component is $\\phi(3)=2$. Thus, $N(3) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **$N(6)$**: This requires $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ to divide 6 for each $i$. Since $o_i > 1$, the order can be 2, 3, or 6. For each component, the number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. Thus, $N(6) = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThe number of elements of order exactly $d$ in an abelian group is given by the formula $\\sum_{k|d} \\mu(d/k)N(k)$, where $\\mu$ is the MÃ¶bius function. For $d=6$, the number of characters of order 6 is:\nNumber of order 6 = $\\mu(1)N(6) + \\mu(2)N(3) + \\mu(3)N(2) + \\mu(6)N(1)$\n$= (1) \\cdot N(6) + (-1) \\cdot N(3) + (-1) \\cdot N(2) + (1) \\cdot N(1)$\n$= N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)$\n$= 625 - 16 - 1 + 0$\n$= 608$\n\n"
