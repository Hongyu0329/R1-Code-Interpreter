    "The determinant of the given adjacency matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis calculated as follows:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nThe term \"Markov quiver\" often refers to a quiver with three vertices arranged in a cycle, which is associated with the Markov equation x² + y² + z² - xyz = 0. The specific matrix provided in the question is related to the study of these quivers, particularly for the case where the weights of the arrows are (2,2,2). The determinant of the adjacency matrix is a property studied in the context of graph theory and quiver representations. The parameter \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) appears to be extraneous information given that the matrix A is explicitly defined.\n\nThe computation of the determinant of the provided matrix is straightforward and yields 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
