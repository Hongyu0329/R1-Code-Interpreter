The horizontal distance $D$ is given by the expression:
$D = \frac{v_0 c}{g\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}} \cdot \text{arccosh}\left(1 + \frac{gh}{c^2}\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}\right)$
This result is independent of the mass $m$. It depends on the initial velocity $v_0$, the height $h$, and the fundamental constants $g$ (acceleration due to gravity) and $c$ (the speed of light).
