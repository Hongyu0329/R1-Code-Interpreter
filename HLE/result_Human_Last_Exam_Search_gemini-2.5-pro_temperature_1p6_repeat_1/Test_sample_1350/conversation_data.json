    "After a thorough review of William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, no character visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that readers will recognize as referring to Romulus and Remus.\n\nWhile the novel is centered on the conflict between the Germanic Goths and the invading Roman Empire, it does not contain a scene where a character travels to a Roman urban center and witnesses religious ceremonies. The descriptions of the Romans are generally from the perspective of the Goths, focusing on their military threat and contrasting their societal values with those of the Wolfing clan.\n\nInterestingly, the novel does feature a motif reminiscent of the Romulus and Remus myth, but it is tied to one of the Gothic protagonists. The character **Hall-Sun**, a maiden of the Wolfing house, recounts her mysterious origins, revealing she was a foundling discovered in the woods where she was lovingly cared for by a she-wolf. This narrative of a child being nurtured by a wolf directly parallels the foundational myth of Rome. However, this is an element of her personal history within the Gothic tribe and not an observation of Roman religious practices.\n\nScholarly analysis of Morris's work highlights his use of historical and mythological sources, including his knowledge of Roman history and Germanic sagas. The she-wolf symbol is historically associated with Rome, a connection that a well-read Victorian author like Morris would have known. However, in *The House of the Wolfings*, he inverts this imagery, associating it with the ancestry of a heroic Gothic figure rather than with the Romans, who are portrayed as antagonists.\n\nIn conclusion, while the novel contains an allusion to the famous Roman foundation myth through the backstory of a Gothic character, the specific scenario described in the question does not occur in the book.\n\n<<<No character in William Morris's The House of the Wolfings visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus.>>>"
