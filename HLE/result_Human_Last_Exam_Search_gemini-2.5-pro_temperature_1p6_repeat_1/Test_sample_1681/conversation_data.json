    "In the framework of the quantum prisoner's dilemma, designing an optimal initial state involves creating a maximally entangled state between the two players' qubits. When players then choose their best strategies, they can avail themselves of quantum strategies that are not possible in the classical version of the game. This leads to a new equilibrium point that is also Pareto optimal, effectively resolving the dilemma inherent in the classical game.\n\nThe standard model for this scenario is the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) scheme. In this model, with a maximally entangled initial state, there exists a quantum strategy, often denoted as 'Q', which, if chosen by both players, leads to a new Nash Equilibrium. For a general payoff matrix, the expected payoff for each player is a weighted average of the classical outcomes, where the weights are the probabilities of those outcomes.\n\nBy applying the optimal quantum strategy 'Q' for both players in the EWL formalism, the probability of the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome becomes 1, while the probabilities of all other outcomes (Cooperate-Defect, Defect-Cooperate, and Defect-Defect) become 0.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium payoff is the payoff associated with the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome. Given the payoff matrix:\n\n[[(5,5) , (0,7)],\n [(7,0) , (1,1)]]\n\nThe (Cooperate, Cooperate) payoff is (5,5).\n\n<<< (5,5) >>>"
