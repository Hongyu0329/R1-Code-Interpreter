    "The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. To determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of its integral cohomology ring, we first need to find the additive structure of the integral cohomology groups $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe manifold $G(3, 5)$ is a 6-dimensional, compact, non-orientable manifold. The integral cohomology groups for $G(3,5)$ are known and can be found in several sources in algebraic topology literature. Multiple independent computations confirm the following structure:\n*   $H^0(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^2(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nThe integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of these groups. The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order. For the cohomology ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, its torsion subgroup is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. Based on the list above, the torsion subgroup is:\n\n$T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^6$\n\nThe question asks for the rank of this torsion subgroup. In the context of abelian groups, the rank (or torsion-free rank) of a group $A$ is defined as the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. For any torsion group $T$, every element has finite order, and thus $T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = 0$. Consequently, the rank of any finite or torsion abelian group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
