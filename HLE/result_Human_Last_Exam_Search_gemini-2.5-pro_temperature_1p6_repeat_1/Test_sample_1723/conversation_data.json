    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile some mushrooms have blue coloring on their caps or stems, or bruise blue when handled, their spore prints are not blue. Spore prints are a crucial tool for mushroom identification, and the known colors are typically shades of white, cream, pink, yellow, orange, brown, purple-brown, and black.\n\nSome examples of mushrooms with blue characteristics but different colored spore prints include:\n\n*   ***Lactarius indigo***: This mushroom has a blue cap and gills and even \"bleeds\" a blue milky latex, but its spore print is yellowish-cream.\n*   ***Stropharia caerulea***: Known as the blue roundhead, this mushroom has a blue-green cap, but its spore print is purple-brown.\n*   ***Psilocybe*** **species**: Many mushrooms in this genus, like *Psilocybe cyanescens* (the wavy cap), bruise a distinct blue color. However, their spore print is a very dark purple-brown.\n\nIn the world of mycology, a green spore print, such as that of the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, is considered a rare and unusual color, further highlighting the unlikelihood of a blue spore print.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
