    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom.\n\nFor the **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)** complex, the molecule possesses a **S₄** point group symmetry. This corresponds to a distorted tetrahedral geometry around the copper(I) ion.\n\nFor the **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)** complex, as seen in the crystal structure of its tetrafluoroborate salt, the copper(II) ion is in a distorted octahedral environment. The complex has an inversion center, and its point group is **Cᵢ**. The copper atom is located at a crystallographic center of symmetry.\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex>>>"
