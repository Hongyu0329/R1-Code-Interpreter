    "The European Tango is distinct from the other ballroom dances in its fundamental technique, which makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the core characteristics of the dance.\n\nThe primary technical reasons are:\n*   **No Rise and Fall:** Tango is a flat dance, meaning the dancers move on a level plane without the rise and fall that is characteristic of the waltz or foxtrot. This vertical movement in other dances helps facilitate and absorb rotation.\n*   **No Sway:** The staccato nature of Tango prohibits body sway. In swing dances like the Waltz and Foxtrot, sway is used to shape turns and control momentum, which can be manipulated to add rotation.\n*   **Staccato Movement:** Tango is known for its sharp, staccato action, where feet are picked up and placed deliberately. This is in stark contrast to the continuous, flowing, and gliding steps of swing dances, which generate momentum that can be used to overturn a figure.\n*   **Footwork and Placement:** The technique for turning in Tango involves placing the feet without swivel. The mechanics of the steps in a figure like the Basic Reverse Turn are precise and clipped, not allowing for the fluid over-rotation that is possible in dances like the Waltz or Foxtrot, where overturning figures is a recognized variation.\n\nIn dances such as the Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the use of momentum, swing, sway, and rise and fall makes it technically possible to overturn figures like the reverse turn. While this may be an advanced or non-standard variation, it does not violate the foundational principles of swing and body flight inherent to those dances.\n\nThe European Tango's unique combination of a compact hold, staccato action, and the absence of rise, fall, and sway creates a technical framework where the prescribed amount of turn for a figure like the Reverse Turn cannot be exceeded without fundamentally breaking the dance's core technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
