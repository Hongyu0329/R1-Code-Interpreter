    "Without the influence of the Norse invasions and the subsequent interaction between Old English and Old Norse speakers, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster** (pronounced to rhyme with \"buster\").\n\nHere is the linguistic breakdown of how this conclusion is reached:\n\n*   **The Native Old English Word:** The original Anglo-Saxon word for a female sibling was **sweostor**. Over time, as Old English evolved into Middle English, this word naturally shortened and shifted to **suster**.\n\n*   **The Norse Influence:** During the Viking Age, Old Norse speakers settled in large parts of England. Their word for sister was **systir**. Due to the close contact and similarities between the two Germanic languages, the Old Norse `systir` \"contaminated\" or influenced the native English word `suster`. This influence is the specific reason for the \"i\" vowel sound in the modern word \"sister.\"\n\n*   **A \"Pure\" Evolutionary Path:** If the Norse `systir` had never been introduced, `suster` would have followed a different, purely English phonetic development. We can predict its evolution by comparing it to other native words with a similar short \"u\" sound in Middle English that were not altered by Norse influence. Words like *sunu* (son), *lufu* (love), and *cuman* (to come) evolved into the modern words \"son,\" \"love,\" and \"come.\" In these words, the Middle English short \"u\" sound (like the \"oo\" in \"book\") evolved into the /ÊŒ/ vowel sound (the \"uh\" sound in \"cup\" or \"buster\").\n\nTherefore, without the Norse linguistic intervention, `suster` would have followed this same pattern, yielding the modern word \"suster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
