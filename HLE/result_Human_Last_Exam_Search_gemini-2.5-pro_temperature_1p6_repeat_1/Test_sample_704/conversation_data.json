    "On Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself, is **G**.\n\nWhen the colors yellow and blue are combined, the resulting color is green. Sir Isaac Newton, in his work on optics, created a color wheel where he associated the colors of the spectrum with musical notes. This was based on his belief that there was a relationship between the harmonies of color and sound.\n\nNewton's color circle arranged the colors of the rainbow in the following order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. He mapped these colors to the notes of a musical scale, specifically the Dorian mode which starts on the note D. The correspondence he established was as follows:\n\n*   **Red:** D\n*   **Orange:** E\n*   **Yellow:** F\n*   **Green:** G\n*   **Blue:** A\n*   **Indigo:** B\n*   **Violet:** C\n\nThe question asks for the musical note corresponding to the range between green (the combination of yellow and blue) and blue. According to Newton's system, the color green is associated with the musical note G, and the color blue is associated with the musical note A. Therefore, the range between green and blue on his color circle corresponds to the musical note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
