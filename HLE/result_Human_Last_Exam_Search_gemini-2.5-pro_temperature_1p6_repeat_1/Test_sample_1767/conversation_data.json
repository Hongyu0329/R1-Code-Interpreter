    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger system. The Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a material. Since both parts of the system are identical in their topological properties, the bulk of the combined system is also a Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1.\n\nThe \"junction\" refers to the interface between these two regions. The topological properties of such an interface are described by the bulk-boundary correspondence. This principle states that the number of protected chiral edge states at the boundary between two regions with different topological invariants (Chern numbers) is equal to the difference in their Chern numbers.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators with Chern numbers C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1. The number of protected conducting channels at the junction is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of edge states = |C₁ - C₂|\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nNumber of edge states = |1 - 1| = 0\n\nThis means there are no topologically protected conducting states at the interface. The junction is topologically trivial because there is no change in the topological invariant across the boundary. Therefore, if \"Chern number of this junction\" is interpreted as the number of protected edge modes at the interface, the value is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
