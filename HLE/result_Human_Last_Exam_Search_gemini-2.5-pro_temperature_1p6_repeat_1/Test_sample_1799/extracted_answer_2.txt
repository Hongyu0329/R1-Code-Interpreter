It is not true that the second postulate is a necessary consequence of the first in isolation. However, it can be considered superfluous if Maxwell's equations are assumed to be part of the "laws of physics" mentioned in the first postulate. Without this assumption, the first postulate, combined with principles of space-time symmetry, allows for a universal limiting speed, and the second postulate is then needed to identify this speed as the speed of light.
