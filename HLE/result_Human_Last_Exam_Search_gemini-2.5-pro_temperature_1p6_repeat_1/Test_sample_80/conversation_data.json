    "A standard chessboard has 8 squares per side, meaning there are 28 edge squares in total (8+8+6+6). The goal of the game is to place as many non-attacking bishops as possible on these edge squares.\n\nAccording to the rules of chess, bishops attack along diagonals. Research indicates that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an 8x8 chessboard is 14. Furthermore, for the maximum number of 14 bishops to be placed without attacking each other, they must all be positioned on the edge squares of the board. One way to achieve this is to place seven bishops on the 'a' file and seven on the 'h' file. Another configuration is to place bishops on all squares of the first rank (row 1) and all squares of the last rank (row 8), except for the corner squares.\n\nGiven that the two players succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, they placed a total of 14 bishops.\n\nTo find the number of edge squares without bishops, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (placed bishops) = 14\n\nTherefore, 14 edge squares would be empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
