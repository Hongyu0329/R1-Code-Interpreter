    "The provided sequence of numbers consists of abundant numbers that are also divisible by 6. An abundant number is a positive integer for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.\n\nThe sequence is:\n1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352\n\nTo find the next number in this sequence, we need to find the next abundant number after 2352 that is also divisible by 6.\n\nThe last number in the sequence is 2352. The multiples of 6 that follow are 2358, 2364, 2370, and so on. We need to check which of these is the next abundant number.\n\nLet's examine the number 2358. To determine if it's abundant, we sum its proper divisors:\n*   The proper divisors of 2358 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 393, 786, and 1179.\n*   The sum of these divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 393 + 786 + 1179 = 2370.\n\nSince the sum of the proper divisors (2370) is greater than the number itself (2358), 2358 is an abundant number.\n\nTo ensure this is the very next number in the sequence, we should confirm that no integers between 2352 and 2358 are abundant.\n*   2353 is a prime number and therefore deficient.\n*   The sum of the proper divisors of 2354 is 1 + 2 + 1177 = 1180, which is less than 2354 (deficient).\n*   The sum of the proper divisors of 2355 is 1 + 3 + 5 + 15 + 157 + 471 + 785 = 1437, which is less than 2355 (deficient).\n*   The sum of the proper divisors of 2356 is 1 + 2 + 4 + 589 + 1178 = 1774, which is less than 2356 (deficient).\n*   2357 is a prime number and therefore deficient.\n\nThus, the next abundant number after 2352 is indeed 2358. Since 2358 is also divisible by 6, it is the next term in the given sequence.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
