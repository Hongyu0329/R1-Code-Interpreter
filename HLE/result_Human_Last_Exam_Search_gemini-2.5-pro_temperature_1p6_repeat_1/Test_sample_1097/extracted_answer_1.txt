To apply the Banach fixed-point theorem, the appropriate set M is a closed ball with a specific radius R in the Banach space of continuous functions on [0, 1] that vanish at the endpoints.

Specifically, the set M is defined as:

**M = {u ∈ C([0, 1]) | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and ||u||_∞ ≤ R}**

Here:
*   **C([0, 1])** is the space of all continuous functions on the interval [0, 1].
*   **||u||_∞** is the supremum norm, defined as sup_{x∈[0,1]} |u(x)|. The space of functions {u ∈ C([0, 1]) | u(0) = u(1) = 0} equipped with this norm is a Banach space, and M is a closed subset of it, making M a complete metric space.
*   **R** is a positive constant that must be chosen to satisfy two conditions:
    1.  **R < ln(8)**. This ensures the operator is a contraction.
    2.  **exp(R)/8 ≤ R**. This ensures the operator maps the set M into itself.

**Derivation:**

1.  **Fixed-Point Problem:** The boundary value problem can be converted into an equivalent integral equation using the Green's function G(x, s) for the operator -d²/dx² with boundary conditions u(0)=u(1)=0. The problem becomes finding a fixed point for the operator T:
    (Tu)(x) = ∫₀¹ G(x, s) exp(u(s)) ds
    where G(x, s) = { s(1-x) if 0 ≤ s ≤ x; x(1-s) if x ≤ s ≤ 1 }.

2.  **Choosing the Metric Space:** We work in the space X = {u ∈ C([0, 1]) | u(0) = u(1) = 0} with the sup norm ||u||_∞. The set M is defined as a closed ball in X: M = {u ∈ X | ||u||_∞ ≤ R}.

3.  **Contraction Condition:** For T to be a contraction, there must be a constant k < 1 such that ||Tu - Tv||_∞ ≤ k ||u - v||_∞. Applying the Mean Value Theorem to the exponential function, we find that the contraction constant is k = exp(R)/8. Thus, we need **exp(R)/8 < 1**, which simplifies to **R < ln(8)**.

4.  **Self-Mapping Condition:** For T to map M into itself (T: M → M), we need ||Tu||_∞ ≤ R for any u ∈ M. The maximum value of the integral involving the Green's function can be bounded, leading to the inequality ||Tu||_∞ ≤ exp(R)/8. Therefore, we require **exp(R)/8 ≤ R**.

A valid constant R can be any number in the interval [R₀, ln(8)), where R₀ is the unique positive root of the equation R = exp(R)/8. The existence of such an interval guarantees that a suitable set M can be defined.
