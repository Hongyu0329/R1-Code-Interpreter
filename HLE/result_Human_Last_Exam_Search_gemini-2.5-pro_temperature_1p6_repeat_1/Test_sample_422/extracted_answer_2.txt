Here are the two problems JTB runs into, ignoring Gettier problems:

**1. The Agrippan Trilemma (or the Infinite Regress Problem of Justification)**

The "justification" component of the JTB definition presents a structural problem. For a belief to be justified, it must be supported by another belief or reason. However, that supporting reason itself requires justification, which in turn needs another justification, and so on. This leads to three possibilities, none of which are satisfactory for firmly grounding knowledge. This is known as Agrippa's Trilemma:
*   **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justification goes on endlessly, meaning no belief is ever fundamentally justified.
*   **Dogmatic Assumption:** The chain of justification stops at a certain point, but this "basic belief" is simply an unproven assumption.
*   **Circular Reasoning:** The chain of justification eventually circles back to support itself, which is a logical fallacy.

The JTB theory does not, by itself, solve this trilemma. It demands justification but doesn't prescribe how to successfully terminate the need for further justification without being arbitrary or circular. This calls into question whether the "justification" condition can ever be adequately met.

**2. The Dilemma of Fallible Justification**

This problem concerns the necessary strength of the justification. It forces a choice between a standard for justification that is either too weak or impossibly strong.

*   **If justification can be fallible:** This means it is possible to be justified in believing something that is actually false. In this scenario, you could have a justified belief that fails the "truth" condition for knowledge. The problem here, within a system limited to "Knowledge" and "Belief," is the uncertainty it creates. One can have a fallible justified belief, but one can't be certain it's "Knowledge" because the justification doesn't guarantee truth. Most epistemologists today are fallibilists, accepting that justification doesn't have to be conclusive.

*   **If justification must be infallible:** This would mean that to be considered "justified," a belief must be supported by reasons that guarantee its truth. While this would solve the issue of being justified in a false belief, it creates two new issues. First, the "truth" condition in JTB becomes redundant; an infallibly justified belief is by necessity true. Second, this sets an impossibly high standard that most of our everyday beliefs, even those we consider to be knowledge, could never meet. This would lead to radical skepticism, the view that we can know very little or nothing at all.

This dilemma demonstrates that the JTB framework struggles to define a level of justification that is both achievable for humans and strong enough to reliably secure knowledge.
