    "I have been unable to identify the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n\nWhile historical records confirm the existence of a town judge (in Latin, *iudex*; in Hungarian, *városbíró*) in Bártfa during this period, the specific name of the individual holding the office in 1461 is not available in the searched documents.\n\nA book by Mária Fedorčáková, titled *Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)*, reportedly contains a list of the town's judges. Accessing this publication would likely provide a definitive answer to the question.\n\nOne source mentions a town judge named György Stenzl (*Stenzl György*), but the available information suggests he held the position at the beginning of the 15th century, not specifically in 1461.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the answer.>>>"
