    "The user is asking for the largest possible number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\nFrom the first step, I have gathered the following definitions:\n*   **Continuum**: A nonempty compact connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate continuum**: A continuum containing more than one point.\n*   **Composant**: A maximal connected subset of a topological space with respect to a point. Specifically, the composant of a point *x* in a space *X* is the union of all proper subcontinua of *X* that contain *x*. It is also described as a maximal connected subset.\n\nThe key part of the question is about the number of composants in a *product* of two such spaces. The initial search did not directly provide a theorem about the number of composants in a product space. However, I found information about the number of composants in indecomposable continua, which can be uncountable, often with cardinality **c** (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\nMy next step will be to specifically find out how to determine the composants of a product space X × Y from the composants of X and Y. I hypothesize that the composants of the product are related to the products of the composants of the factor spaces.\n\nI also need to find examples of continua with a known number of composants. The search results mention indecomposable continua, such as the pseudo-arc, as having a large number of composants. I will look for more details on this.\n\nFinally, I will combine this information to determine the maximum possible number of composants for a product of two nondegenerate continua. It seems likely that the answer will be related to **c**, the cardinality of the continuum. I will need to confirm if it is **c**, a larger cardinality, or a finite number.I have gathered substantial information in the previous steps. Here's a summary of what I know:\n\n*   **Continuum**: A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum**: A continuum with more than one point.\n*   **Composant**: The composant of a point *x* in a continuum *X* is the set of all points *y* in *X* such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of *X* containing both *x* and *y*.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum**: A continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Number of composants in an indecomposable continuum**: A metric indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants, specifically with cardinality **c** (the cardinality of the real numbers). Non-metrizable indecomposable continua can have one or two composants.\n*   **Composants in a product space**: The composants of a product space Y = ∏Xi are the products of the composants of the factor spaces Xi.\n\nNow I need to synthesize this information to answer the user's question.\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua, let's call them X and Y.\n\nLet C(S) denote the set of composants of a space S. The search results indicate that the set of composants of the product space X × Y is given by {C_x × C_y | C_x ∈ C(X), C_y ∈ C(Y)}. This means the number of composants in the product is the product of the number of composants in each factor space.\n\nTo maximize this product, I should choose two nondegenerate continua, X and Y, that have the largest possible number of composants.\n\nThe search results clearly state that a metric indecomposable continuum has **c** composants. The pseudo-arc is an example of such a continuum.\n\nSo, if I choose X and Y to be two such continua, say two pseudo-arcs, then:\n*   Number of composants in X = **c**\n*   Number of composants in Y = **c**\n\nThe number of composants in their product, X × Y, would be |C(X)| * |C(Y)| = **c** * **c**.\n\nNow I need to determine the value of **c** * **c**. I will perform a search to confirm the cardinality of **c** * **c**.\n\nFinally, I will formulate the final answer based on these findings. The largest possible number of composants should be the result of **c** * **c**.I have performed the necessary research and have a clear path to the answer. The key facts are:\n1.  A continuum is a compact connected metric space.\n2.  A nondegenerate continuum has more than one point.\n3.  The number of composants in a product of spaces is the product of the number of composants in each space.\n4.  There exist nondegenerate continua (indecomposable metric continua) that have **c** (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n5.  The cardinality of the product of the set of real numbers with itself is **c**.\n\nTherefore, if we take two nondegenerate continua X and Y, each having **c** composants, their product X × Y will have **c** * **c** = **c** composants. I have all the information required and will now proceed to formulate the final answer.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum (the number of real numbers).\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n*   **Definition of a Continuum and Composant:** A continuum is a compact, connected metric space. A continuum that consists of more than one point is called nondegenerate. The *composant* of a point *p* in a continuum *X* is the set of all points *q* in *X* for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of *X* that contains both *p* and *q*. The composants of a continuum partition the space.\n\n*   **Composants of a Product Space:** For two topological spaces *X* and *Y*, the composants of their product space, *X × Y*, are the Cartesian products of the a composant of *X* and a composant of *Y*. Consequently, the number of composants in *X × Y* is the product of the number of composants in *X* and the number of composants in *Y*.\n\n*   **Maximizing the Number of Composants:** To find the largest possible number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua, we must select two continua that each have the maximum possible number of composants.\n    *   A simple continuum, like a closed interval or a circle, is \"decomposable\" and has only one composant (the space itself).\n    *   However, a class of continua known as **indecomposable continua** can have a vast number of composants. A metric indecomposable continuum is known to have **c** composants, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers). A well-known example of such a continuum is the pseudo-arc.\n\n*   **Calculation:** Let *X* and *Y* be two nondegenerate, metric, indecomposable continua.\n    *   The number of composants in *X* is **c**.\n    *   The number of composants in *Y* is **c**.\n\n    The number of composants in their product, *X × Y*, is therefore **c × c**.\n\n*   **Cardinal Arithmetic:** In the arithmetic of infinite cardinal numbers, the product of the cardinality of the continuum with itself is equal to the cardinality of the continuum: **c × c = c**. This is a fundamental result in set theory, which intuitively means that the number of points on a plane (ℝ²) is the same as the number of points on a line (ℝ).\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**.\n\n<<<**c**>>>"
