    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This algorithm involves performing polynomial elementary row operations on the matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2, to reduce it to a simpler form. Let G be the GCRD. The procedure will transform the stacked matrix `[P1; P2]` into the form `[G; 0]`.\n\nFirst, let's form the stacked matrix M:\nM = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nLet R1, R2, R3, and R4 be the rows of M.\nR1 = [s^2 + s, -s]\nR2 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\nR3 = [s, 0]\nR4 = [-s - 1, 1]\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by using polynomial combinations of rows to simplify the matrix. The goal is to introduce zero rows. A common simplification is to first make one of the matrices simpler through left multiplication by a unimodular matrix. Let's work with P2.\n\nLet's left-multiply P2 by the unimodular matrix `U = [[1, 0], [1, 1]]` (det(U) = 1).\n`P2' = U * P2 = [[1, 0], [1, 1]] * [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]] = [[s, 0], [s + (-s-1), 0 + 1]] = [[s, 0], [-1, 1]]`\nThe GCRD of P1 and P2 is the same as the GCRD of P1 and P2'. We now apply the Euclidean algorithm to the matrix `[P1; P2']`:\n\nM' = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2], [s, 0], [-1, 1]]\n\nLet the new rows be R1, R2, R3', R4'.\nR1 = [s^2 + s, -s]\nR2 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\nR3' = [s, 0]\nR4' = [-1, 1]\n\nWe use R3' and R4' to eliminate terms in R1 and R2.\nReplace R1 with `R1 + s*R4'`:\n`R1_new = [s^2 + s, -s] + s*[-1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s, -s + s] = [s^2, 0]`\n\nReplace R2 with `R2 - s^2*R4'`:\n`R2_new = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2*[-1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 - s^2] = [-1, 0]`\n\nThe matrix of rows becomes: `{ [s^2, 0], [-1, 0], [s, 0], [-1, 1] }`.\nLet these rows be `R1_new, R2_new, R3', R4'`. We can now use `R2_new = [-1, 0]` to simplify `R1_new` and `R3'`.\n\nReplace `R1_new` with `R1_new + s^2*R2_new`:\n`[s^2, 0] + s^2*[-1, 0] = [s^2 - s^2, 0] = [0, 0]`\n\nReplace `R3'` with `R3' + s*R2_new`:\n`[s, 0] + s*[-1, 0] = [s - s, 0] = [0, 0]`\n\nAfter these operations, the matrix of rows is `{ [0, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 0], [-1, 1] }`.\nWe have two zero rows. The remaining non-zero rows form a GCRD. Let's call this matrix G_found.\nG_found = [[-1, 0], [-1, 1]]\n\nTo verify this, we must check that G_found is a common right divisor and that any other common right divisor is a right divisor of G_found.\nA matrix is a right divisor of P if `P * G_found_inv` is a polynomial matrix.\n`det(G_found) = (-1)(1) - (0)(-1) = -1`.\nSince the determinant is a non-zero constant, G_found is a unimodular matrix. Its inverse is also a polynomial matrix.\n`G_found_inv = (1/-1) * [[1, 0], [1, -1]] = [[-1, 0], [-1, 1]] = G_found`.\n\nLet's check if G_found is a right divisor of P1 and P2.\n`P1 * G_found_inv = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] * [[-1, 0], [-1, 1]] = [[-(s^2+s)+s, -s], [-(-s^2-1)-s^2, s^2]] = [[-s^2, -s], [1, s^2]]`\nThis is a polynomial matrix, so G_found is a right divisor of P1.\n\n`P2 * G_found_inv = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]] * [[-1, 0], [-1, 1]] = [[-s, 0], [-(-s-1)-1, 1]] = [[-s, 0], [s, 1]]`\nThis is a polynomial matrix, so G_found is a right divisor of P2.\n\nSince G_found is a common right divisor and it is unimodular, its determinant is a non-zero constant. If D is any other common right divisor, then G_found = H * D for some polynomial matrix H. This implies `det(G_found) = det(H) * det(D)`, so `-1 = det(H) * det(D)`. This means `det(D)` must also be a non-zero constant, so any other common right divisor D must also be unimodular.\n\nA greatest common right divisor is unique only up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix. Since G_found is itself unimodular, we can simplify it. A common canonical form for a unimodular matrix is the identity matrix, I.\nWe can obtain I from G_found by left-multiplying by another unimodular matrix, specifically `G_found_inv` (which happens to be G_found itself):\n`G_found * G_found = [[-1, 0], [-1, 1]] * [[-1, 0], [-1, 1]] = [[1, 0], [1-1, 1]] = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = I`\n\nThus, the identity matrix `I` is also a GCRD. When matrices are right coprime, their GCRD is any unimodular matrix, and the identity matrix is the simplest representation.\n\n"
