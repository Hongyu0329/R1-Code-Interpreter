    "To solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we first express the terms using Euler's formula.\n\nThe term $i$ can be written as $e^{i\\pi/2}$.\nThe term $i^z$ is multi-valued and can be written as:\n$i^z = e^{z \\ln(i)}$\nThe natural logarithm of $i$ is given by $\\ln(i) = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. So, $i^z = e^{ziC_k}$.\n\nThe original equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{ziC_k}$\n\nLet $z = x+yi$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left side is $(x+yi)i = xi - y = -y + xi$.\nThe right side is $e^{(x+yi)iC_k} = e^{xiC_k - yC_k} = e^{-yC_k}e^{ixC_k} = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts, we get a system of two equations:\n1) $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n2) $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\nWe can also equate the magnitudes of both sides of the equation $-y+xi = e^{-yC_k}e^{ixC_k}$:\n$|-y+xi| = |e^{-yC_k}e^{ixC_k}|$\n$\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = e^{-yC_k}$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$x^2+y^2 = e^{-2yC_k}$\n\nWe can now search for solutions by considering different cases.\n\n**Case 1: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the magnitude equation becomes $x^2 = e^0 = 1$, which gives $x=1$ or $x=-1$.\n\n*   If $z=1$ (i.e., $x=1, y=0$):\n    Let's check in the original equation: $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\implies i=i$.\n    This is true. Thus, **z=1** is a solution.\n\n*   If $z=-1$ (i.e., $x=-1, y=0$):\n    Let's check in the original equation: $(-1) \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\implies -i = \\frac{1}{i} \\implies -i = -i$.\n    This is true. Thus, **z=-1** is a solution.\n\n**Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system of equations (1) and (2) becomes:\n1) $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) = e^{-yC_k}$\n2) $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) = 0$ (This is always true and provides no additional information).\n\nSo we need to find the solutions to $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's analyze the equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$.\n\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi > 0$. Let $C_k=c>0$. The equation is $-y = e^{-yc}$.\n    - If $y>0$, the left side is negative and the right side is positive. No solution.\n    - If $y=0$, we get $0=1$, which is false.\n    - If $y<0$, let $y=-a$ with $a>0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{ac}$. Since $c = C_k \\ge \\pi/2$, the graph of $g(a)=e^{ac}$ starts at $g(0)=1$ and has a slope $g'(0)=c \\ge \\pi/2 > 1$. The graph of $f(a)=a$ starts at $f(0)=0$ with a slope of 1. Because $g(0)>f(0)$ and $g'(a)>f'(a)$ for $a>0$, we have $e^{ac} > a$ for all $a>0$. Thus, there are no solutions for $a>0$.\n    So, there are no purely imaginary solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi < 0$. Let $C_k=-c$ where $c=-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) > 0$. The equation is $-y=e^{yc}$.\n    - If $y>0$, the left side is negative and the right side is positive. No solution.\n    - If $y=0$, we get $0=1$, which is false.\n    - If $y<0$, let $y=-a$ with $a>0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{-ac}$. Let's consider the functions $f(a)=a$ and $g(a)=e^{-ac}$. $f(0)=0$ and $g(0)=1$. As $a \\to \\infty$, $f(a) \\to \\infty$ and $g(a) \\to 0$. Since both functions are continuous, there must be at least one intersection for $a>0$. The derivative $g'(a)=-ce^{-ac}$ is always negative, so $g(a)$ is strictly decreasing, while $f(a)$ is strictly increasing. This guarantees that there is exactly one solution $a_k > 0$ for each $k \\le -1$.\n    Thus, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k = -ia_k$, where $a_k$ is the solution to $a = e^{-a(-C_k)}$.\n\n**Case 3: Complex solutions ($x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$)**\nFinding these solutions requires solving the system of transcendental equations derived earlier:\n1) $x^2+y^2 = e^{-2yC_k}$\n2) $\\tan(xC_k) = -x/y$\nA full analytical description of these solutions is not straightforward. However, the question asks for all solutions, and the real and purely imaginary solutions have been fully characterized.\n\nThe solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ are:\n1.  The real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions: for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution of the form $z_k = iy_k$ where $y_k$ is the unique negative real number that satisfies the equation $-y_k = e^{-y_k(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution $z_k=iy_k$ where $y_k<0$ is the solution to the equation $-y=e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$.\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution $z_k=iy_k$ where $y_k<0$ is the solution to the equation $-y=e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$.>>>"
