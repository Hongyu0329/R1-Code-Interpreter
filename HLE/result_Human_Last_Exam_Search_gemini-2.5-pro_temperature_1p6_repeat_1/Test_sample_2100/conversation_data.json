    "The man Andrei Voznesensky wrote about was Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\nThe lines are from Voznesensky's poem that formed the basis of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\" The production tells the story of the Russian explorer and statesman Nikolai Rezanov and his love for Concepción Argüello, the 15-year-old daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco.\n\nRezanov, a key figure in the Russian-American Company, journeyed to California in 1806 to secure provisions for the struggling Russian colonies in Alaska. During his six-week stay, he and Concepción fell in love and became engaged. He then began the arduous journey back to St. Petersburg to gain the Tsar's permission to marry the Catholic girl, but fell ill, died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807, and was buried there.\n\nHis grave was later destroyed. In the late 20th century, interest in his story grew, and his presumed remains were reburied. A memorial with a white cross now stands at the Trinity churchyard in Krasnoyarsk. One side of the cross reads, \"Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov 1764 — 1807. I will never forget you,\" and the other bears the words of his betrothed, \"Maria Concepcion de Arguello 1791 — 1857. I will see you nevermore.\"\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
