    "The Hopf charge of a vector field is a topological invariant that describes how the field lines are twisted and linked in three-dimensional space. It can be calculated using Whitehead's integral formula, which relates the charge to an integral over all space of the dot product of a vector potential and the field itself.\n\nFor the specific vector field provided:\n*   n_x = sin(G)cos(f)\n*   n_y = sin(G)sin(f)\n*   n_z = cos(G)\n\nwhere `f = atan2(y,x)` and `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`. This vector field describes a mapping from the 3D space (ℝ³) to the surface of a 2D sphere (S²), where `f` and `G` act as the azimuthal and polar angles on the sphere, respectively. For such a field to have a well-defined integer Hopf charge, the vector field must point in the same direction everywhere at infinity. In this case, as the distance from the origin approaches infinity, `r2` approaches infinity, causing `G` to approach 0. This makes the vector field `(nx, ny, nz)` point towards `(0, 0, 1)` at infinity, satisfying the condition.\n\nThe Hopf charge for fields with this structure can be understood as the product of two winding numbers:\n1.  The winding number associated with the azimuthal angle `f`. The function `f = atan2(y, x)` corresponds to the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates. As one makes a full circle around the z-axis, `f` goes from 0 to 2π, meaning it has a winding number of 1.\n2.  The winding number associated with the polar angle `G`. The function `G` maps the `(ρ, z)` plane (where `ρ = sqrt(x² + y²)`) to the polar angle. `G` is 0 at infinity and reaches its maximum value of `π` on the circle defined by `z=0` and `x² + y² = 0.5`. This full sweep from 0 to π corresponds to a winding number of 1.\n\nThe total Hopf charge is the product of these winding numbers. This principle is often applied in the study of topological solitons, or hopfions, where the topological charge is determined by the integer winding numbers of the field's parameterization.\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge `H` is 1 × 1 = 1. This value signifies that the pre-image of any two distinct points on the sphere are curves in 3D space that are linked together exactly once.\n\n<<<1>>>"
