    "The metrical pattern for the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\" is composed of a specific sequence of dactyls (a long syllable followed by two short syllables) and spondees (two long syllables). The scansion accounts for poetic conventions and elisions, which are the omission of certain vowel sounds at word boundaries.\n\nThe scansion for the line is as follows:\n\nDactyl - Spondee - Dactyl - Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee\n\nTherefore, the pattern is represented as:\n\n<<<D S D D S S>>>"
