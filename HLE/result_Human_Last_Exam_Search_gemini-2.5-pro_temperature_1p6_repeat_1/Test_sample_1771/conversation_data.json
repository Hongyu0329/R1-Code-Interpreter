    "The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb **\\*seh₂gieti**, meaning \"'(s)he's giving a sign' or 'he/she tracks/seeks out'\", provides the basis for a well-established verb in the Germanic language family. Its cognates in other Indo-European branches, such as Hittite *sākizzi* (\"(s)he gives a sign\") and Latin *sāgīre* (\"to be keen-nosed, perceive keenly\"), confirm the root *seh₂g- meaning \"to track, seek out\".\n\nHere is its development into Proto-Germanic and its subsequent reflexes in Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German:\n\n### Proto-Germanic\nThe PIE present tense form \\*seh₂gieti evolved into the Proto-Germanic verb **\\*sōkijaną**, which means \"to seek\". This change followed regular sound laws:\n*   The PIE sequence **\\*eh₂** became **\\*ō** in Proto-Germanic.\n*   According to Grimm's Law, the PIE voiced velar stop **\\*g** shifted to the voiceless velar stop **\\*k**.\n*   The PIE suffix **\\*-ie-** marks this verb as a Class 1 weak verb in Proto-Germanic.\nThe reconstructed 3rd person singular present indicative form is **\\*sōkīþi**.\n\n### Old Norse\nIn Old Norse, Proto-Germanic *\\*sōkijaną* became **sœkja** (also found as *sǿkja* or *sækja*). The `j` in the suffix triggered i-umlaut, changing the root vowel *ō* to *œ*.\n\n### Old English\nThe reflex in Old English is **sēcan** (with variants like *sœ̄ċan* and *sēċean*). Similar to Old Norse, the process of i-mutation changed the Proto-Germanic root vowel *ō* to *ē* in Old English.\n\n### Old High German\nIn Old High German, the verb appears as **suohhen** (or *suochen*). In this case, the Proto-Germanic *k* underwent the High German Consonant Shift, becoming the fricative *hh* [x] between vowels. The root vowel *ō* developed into the diphthong *uo*.\n\nThis Proto-Germanic verb is the direct ancestor of the modern English word \"seek,\" the modern German \"suchen,\" and the modern Swedish \"söka\".\n\n<<<The PIE verb *seh₂gieti gives Proto-Germanic *\\*sōkijaną*, which in turn gives Old Norse *sœkja*, Old English *sēcan*, and Old High German *suohhen*.>>>"
