    "Based on an analysis of the game board, the optimal moves for O to win as fast as possible are c4 and f4.\n\n### Analysis of the Game State\n\nIt is currently O's turn to play. An examination of the board reveals a significant opportunity for O on the 4th row.\n\n*   **Horizontal Threat**: Player O has two pieces next to each other in positions d4 and e4. This setup allows for the creation of a winning threat.\n\n*   **Optimal Moves**:\n    *   **Move c4**: By placing a piece in c4, O forms a line of three with `c4, d4, e4`. This creates a situation with two open ends at b4 and f4. No matter which of these squares X blocks on the next turn, O can place a piece on the other square and complete a four-in-a-row to win the game.\n    *   **Move f4**: Similarly, placing a piece in f4 creates a line of three at `d4, e4, f4`. This also results in two winning squares for O on the next turn, c4 and g4. X can only block one, guaranteeing a win for O on their following move.\n\nThese two moves are the fastest possible ways for O to win, as they each set up a forced win on O's next turn. Any other move would allow X to block the threat and prolong the game.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
