    "To design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system, we need to find an observer gain matrix `L` such that the eigenvalues of the matrix `A - LC` are all located at the origin of the complex plane (i.e., all are zero). This ensures that the observation error, `e(k) = x(k) - \\hat{x}(k)`, converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps.\n\nThe system is defined by:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith the matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\n`B = [[0], [1], [-1], [1]]`\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe dynamics of the observer error are given by `e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`. We want to place the eigenvalues of `A - LC` at zero. This is a pole placement problem.\n\n**1. Observability Check**\nFirst, we must verify that the system is observable. The system is observable if the observability matrix `O = [C^T, (CA)^T, (CA^2)^T, (CA^3)^T]^T` has full rank, which is `n=4` (the dimension of the state vector). A search is performed to find an online tool or reference for calculating the observability of a system.\n\nAfter determining the system is observable, the next step is to calculate the observer gain `L`. This is done by placing the poles of the observer, which are the eigenvalues of `A - LC`, at the origin. The characteristic polynomial should be `λ^n = λ^4 = 0`.\n\nThe pole placement can be achieved using the principle of duality, which relates the observer design problem to a controller design problem. The eigenvalues of `A - LC` are the same as the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T L^T`. This is a state-feedback control problem for the system `(A^T, C^T)` with a feedback gain of `K = L^T`.\n\nSince the original system `(A, C)` is observable, the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` is controllable. We can place the poles of `A^T - C^T K` at the origin. For multi-output systems, there is freedom in choosing the gain matrix. A common simplification is to use only a subset of the outputs for the design, as long as observability is maintained.\n\nLet's check if the system is observable using only the first output, `y_1(k) = x_1(k)`. This corresponds to the first row of `C`, let's call it `c_1 = [1, 0, 0, 0]`. If the pair `(A, c_1)` is observable, we can design the observer using only `y_1` and set the second column of `L` to all zeros. The observability matrix for this single-output system would be `O_1 = [c_1^T, (c_1A)^T, (c_1A^2)^T, (c_1A^3)^T]^T`. It can be shown that `det(O_1) = -1`, which is non-zero, confirming observability.\n\nThis simplification allows us to find a solution for `L` where the second column is zero. The first column of `L`, let's call it `l_1`, is found by solving the pole placement problem for `(A, c_1)`. This can be done by setting the characteristic equation `det(λI - (A - l_1 c_1)) = λ^4`.\n\nAlternatively, we use the dual formulation. With `L = [l_1, 0]`, the matrix `L^T` becomes `K = [l_1^T; 0]`. This simplification, however, proves to be algebraically intensive. The more direct calculation for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` is to set the second column of `L` to zero (`l_{i2} = 0`). This choice is valid because the system is observable through the first output channel alone.\nWe need to find the gain vector `l_1 = [l_{11}, l_{21}, l_{31}, l_{41}]^T` such that `A - l_1 c_1` has all eigenvalues at zero.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system `A_c = A' - C'L'` is set to `λ^4 = 0`. With the simplification `L` having a zero second column, we solve for the elements of the first column `l_i1`. The equations for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are:\n*   `Coefficient of λ^3: 2 + l_{11} = 0`\n*   `Coefficient of λ^2: 3 + l_{11} + l_{41} = 0`\n*   `Coefficient of λ^1: -1 + l_{11} + l_{31} = 0`\n*   `Coefficient of λ^0: -3 - 2l_{11} + l_{21} = 0`\n\nSolving this system of linear equations yields:\n1.  From the `λ^3` coefficient: `l_{11} = -2`\n2.  Substitute `l_{11}` into the `λ^0` equation: `-3 - 2(-2) + l_{21} = 0 ⇒ 1 + l_{21} = 0 ⇒ l_{21} = -1`\n3.  Substitute `l_{11}` into the `λ^1` equation: `-1 + (-2) + l_{31} = 0 ⇒ l_{31} = 3`\n4.  Substitute `l_{11}` into the `λ^2` equation: `3 + (-2) + l_{41} = 0 ⇒ 1 + l_{41} = 0 ⇒ l_{41} = -1`\n\nSo, the first column of the gain matrix `L` is `[-2, -1, 3, -1]^T`. The second column is all zeros.\n\nThe resulting observer gain matrix `L` is:\n\n`L = [[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n\nThis gain matrix places all the observer poles at the origin, which guarantees that the observation error will become identically zero after a finite number of steps (at most `n=4` steps).\n\n<<<\n`[[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n>>>"
