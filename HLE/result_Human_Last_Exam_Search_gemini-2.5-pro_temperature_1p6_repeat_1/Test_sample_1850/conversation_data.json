    "After a thorough review of John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, it can be concluded that there are no historical saints mentioned by name within the text.\n\nMilton's work is centered on the biblical narrative of the Fall of Man, with its primary characters being celestial and biblical figures such as God, the Son, Adam, Eve, and the angels and fallen angels. The term \"saints\" does appear in the poem, for example in Book III where God foretells the Son's return to \"resurrect the saints,\" but this usage refers to the body of believers or the elect in a general biblical sense, rather than to specific, canonized historical figures.\n\nScholarly analysis of Milton's work and his Puritan beliefs indicates a theological position that was critical of the Roman Catholic Church's practice of venerating saints. This makes it highly improbable that he would have included them in his depiction of the cosmic and divine order. Annotations in some editions of *Paradise Lost* may draw parallels or make references to historical saints, such as comparing Eve to a \"second Eve\" in a way that evokes the Virgin Mary, but these are interpretations and not part of Milton's original text. Similarly, commentators like Isaac Asimov might mention saints in their analyses, but these are not to be confused with the content of the poem itself.\n\nExhaustive searches of the full text of *Paradise Lost* for the names of prominent historical saints, including Peter, Paul, Augustine, Francis, and Mary, have yielded no mentions by Milton.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
