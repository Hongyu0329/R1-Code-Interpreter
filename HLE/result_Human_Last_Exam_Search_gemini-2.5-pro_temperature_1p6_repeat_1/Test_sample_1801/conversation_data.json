    "The two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Paul Krugman.\n\nThe campaign, with its tagline \"Ask Why,\" preceded the company's scandalous collapse. Murray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969, was identified as the man with white hair and glasses in one of the commercials. His participation in the ad has been confirmed by various sources, including a YouTube video of the commercial itself.\n\nPaul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, also had a paid advisory role with Enron in 1999. Although his association with the company is well-documented and has been a point of controversy, his appearance in the \"Ask Why\" commercial alongside Gell-Mann is the subject of the infamous ad campaign.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
