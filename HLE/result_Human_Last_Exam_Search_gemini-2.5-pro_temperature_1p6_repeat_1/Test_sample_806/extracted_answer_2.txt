The specific biochemical reaction that initiated the widespread skin blisters is the massive, immune-mediated death of keratinocytes (the primary cells of the epidermis). This process is known as apoptosis and necroptosis (programmed cell death). This severe reaction is characteristic of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which are frequently caused by certain antiepileptic drugs.

The chain of events begins when the patient's immune system, specifically cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, mistakenly recognizes the drug as a threat. This triggers the release of several potent biochemical mediators that command the skin cells to die. The key biochemical reactions involved are:

*   **Granulysin-Mediated Cell Death**: Upon activation by the drug, immune cells release a cytotoxic protein called granulysin. Studies have identified secretory granulysin as a primary molecule responsible for the widespread death of keratinocytes in SJS/TEN. High concentrations of granulysin are found in the blister fluid and are directly linked to the severity of the reaction.

*   **Fas-Fas Ligand (Fas-FasL) Pathway**: This is another major pathway leading to keratinocyte apoptosis. Activated immune cells produce a molecule called Fas ligand (FasL), which binds to the Fas receptor on the surface of keratinocytes. This binding activates a cascade of enzymes within the keratinocyte, ultimately leading to programmed cell death.

In essence, the drug acts as a trigger that unleashes a powerful and misdirected immune attack on the patient's own skin cells. The widespread cell death causes the epidermis to separate from the dermis, resulting in the characteristic and dangerous blistering and peeling of the skin.
