    "There are no Cysteine residues located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nBased on the UniProt entry for the human GABAAρ1 subunit (accession number P24046), the protein consists of 479 amino acids. The transmembrane domains are located at the following positions:\n*   **TM1:** 251-271\n*   **TM2:** 284-304\n*   **TM3:** 331-351\n*   **TM4:** 450-470\n\nThe TM3-TM4 linker corresponds to the amino acid sequence between the end of TM3 (position 351) and the beginning of TM4 (position 450). This linker region spans from amino acid 352 to 449. An analysis of this specific amino acid sequence reveals the absence of any cysteine residues.\n\n<<<0>>>"
