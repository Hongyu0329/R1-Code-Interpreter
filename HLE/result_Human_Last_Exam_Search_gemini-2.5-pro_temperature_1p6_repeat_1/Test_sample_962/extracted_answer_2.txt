A tightly secure `t`-out-of-`n` threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed by following a structure exemplified by the FROST protocol. The design consists of three phases: a secure **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)** to create and share the secret key, a message-independent **pre-computation round**, and a final **online signing round**.

First, during the **Key Generation** phase, a `t-1` degree polynomial is used to share the secret key via Shamir's Secret Sharing, and a DKG protocol is employed to allow `n` participants to collaboratively create their key shares and a single group public key without a trusted dealer.

The signing process itself is split into two rounds:

1.  **Round One (Commitment):** This round can be performed offline, before the message is known. Each of the `t` participating signers generates one or more secret nonces and broadcasts public commitments to these nonces. This pre-computation significantly speeds up the actual signing.

2.  **Round Two (Signature Share Generation):** This is the online phase. Once a message is to be signed, a coordinator sends it to the `t` signers. Each signer verifies the commitments from the others, computes a group-wide challenge (typically by hashing the message and other public data), and then uses their secret key share and secret nonce to compute a signature share. These shares are sent back to the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates at least `t` shares into a final signature, which is verifiable with the group's public key.

To be "tightly secure," the scheme must be unforgeable against an adversary controlling up to `t-1` participants and is often proven secure in the random oracle model based on the hardness of a problem like the discrete logarithm or Learning With Errors (LWE) for post-quantum schemes. Modern designs often feature an "identifiable abort" mechanism, which allows for the identification of misbehaving participants if the protocol fails. While FROST is a prime example based on classical assumptions, newer schemes like Ringtail apply these same principles to provide quantum-resistant two-round threshold signatures based on lattices.
