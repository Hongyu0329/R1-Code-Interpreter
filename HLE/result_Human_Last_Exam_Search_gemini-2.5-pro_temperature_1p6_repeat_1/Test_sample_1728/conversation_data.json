    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 9.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the interpretation of the \"sum of graphs\" as the join operation, a standard concept in graph theory. The join of graphs \\( G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k \\), denoted as \\( G_1 + G_2 + \\ldots + G_k \\), is formed by taking the disjoint union of these graphs and adding all possible edges between the vertices of different graphs.\n\nA key property of the join operation is that the chromatic number of the resulting graph is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs. Specifically, for three graphs \\( C_{n_1}, C_{n_2}, \\) and \\( C_{n_3} \\), the chromatic number of their join is \\( \\chi(C_{n_1} + C_{n_2} + C_{n_3}) = \\chi(C_{n_1}) + \\chi(C_{n_2}) + \\chi(C_{n_3}) \\).\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle of length \\( n \\), denoted \\( \\chi(C_n) \\), depends on the parity of \\( n \\):\n*   If \\( n \\) is even, the cycle is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\n*   If \\( n \\) is odd, the cycle is not bipartite, and its chromatic number is 3.\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of the sum of three cycles, we need to maximize the individual chromatic numbers of these cycles. This is achieved when each of the three cycles has an odd length, making their chromatic number 3.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is the sum of the maximal chromatic numbers of three individual cycles:\n\\( \\chi(G)_{max} = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \\).\n\n<<<9>>>"
