    "To determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we first analyze the structure of the field extension.\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and it is well-known to be a Galois extension with $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$.\n\nLet $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Then $L = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$. The degree of the extension $L/K$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, and 2 otherwise.\n\nTo check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ down to an intermediate field, for instance $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let $\\sigma$ be the automorphism of $K$ sending $\\sqrt{3} \\to -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. For $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 6 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSuppose $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This would lead to $a^2+2b^2=6$ and $2ab=0$. If $a=0$, $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3$, which is not possible for $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. If $b=0$, $a^2=6$, which is also not possible. Thus, 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\nThis means $[L:K] = 2$, and consequently $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nThe phrase \"Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$\" implies the Galois group of the Galois closure of $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We must first determine if $L$ itself is a Galois extension. For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, the field $L$ must be the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of one of its elements. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha=\\sqrt{\\beta}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has roots of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma(\\beta)}$ for each $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Let the non-trivial automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ be $\\sigma_2 (\\sqrt{2}\\to-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\to\\sqrt{3})$, $\\sigma_3 (\\sqrt{2}\\to\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\to-\\sqrt{3})$, and $\\sigma_4 = \\sigma_2\\sigma_3$.\n\nThe splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ must contain $\\sqrt{\\sigma(\\beta)}$ for all $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nLet's check if $\\sqrt{\\sigma_3(\\beta)}$ is in $L=K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$. This is equivalent to checking if $\\sigma_3(\\beta)$ or $\\beta\\sigma_3(\\beta)$ is a square in $K$.\n$\\beta\\sigma_3(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nAs established before, this is not a square in $K$. Also, $\\sigma_3(\\beta)$ is not a square in $K$. Thus, $\\sqrt{\\sigma_3(\\beta)} \\notin L$.\nSo, $L$ is not a Galois extension over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe must compute the Galois group of the Galois closure of $L$, let's call it $M$.\n$M$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$.\n$M = L(\\sqrt{\\sigma_3(\\beta)}) = K(\\sqrt{\\beta}, \\sqrt{\\sigma_3(\\beta)})$.\nSince $\\sqrt{\\sigma_3(\\beta)} \\notin L$, we have $[M:L] = 2$.\nTherefore, $[M:\\mathbb{Q}] = [M:L][L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 8 = 16$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(M/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 16.\n\nTo determine the structure of $G$, we can analyze the extension $M/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $u = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}$ and $v = \\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}$. Then $\\beta = u^2 v^2 / ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))\\dots$ Wait. $\\alpha=uv$.\n$L = \\mathbb{Q}(uv, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n$u^2 = 2+\\sqrt{2} \\implies \\sqrt{2} = u^2-2$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(u) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},u)$.\n$v^2 = 3+\\sqrt{3} \\implies \\sqrt{3} = v^2-3$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(v) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3},v)$.\n$L=\\mathbb{Q}(uv, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. The Galois closure $M$ of $L$ is the compositum of the Galois closures of $\\mathbb{Q}(u)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(v)$.\n\n1.  The Galois closure of $\\mathbb{Q}(u) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}})$ is $M_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}, \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}})$, because $\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}}$ and $\\sqrt{2} = u^2-2$ are both in $\\mathbb{Q}(u)$. So $M_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(u)$ is a Galois extension of degree 4, containing $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(M_1/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n2.  The Galois closure of $\\mathbb{Q}(v) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}})$ is $M_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}, \\sqrt{3-\\sqrt{3}})$. The minimal polynomial of $v$ is $x^4-6x^2+6=0$. Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{3\\pm\\sqrt{3}}$. $\\sqrt{3-\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}}$, so $M_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(v, \\sqrt{6})$. The degree of $M_2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is 8, and its Galois group $\\text{Gal}(M_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the dihedral group $D_4$.\n\nThe Galois closure of $L$ is $M = M_1 M_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}, \\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}, \\sqrt{6})$.\nThe intersection of these two fields is $M_1 \\cap M_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe degree of the compositum is $[M:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[M_1:\\mathbb{Q}][M_2:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[M_1\\cap M_2:\\mathbb{Q}]} = \\frac{4 \\times 8}{2} = 16$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(M/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(M_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(M_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ consisting of pairs of automorphisms that agree on the intersection field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is the fibered product of the two Galois groups over $\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n$G \\cong C_4 \\times_{C_2} D_4$.\n\nThis group is a non-abelian group of order 16. Through detailed analysis of its structure (for example, by counting elements of a given order), one can identify it among the 14 groups of order 16. This group has exponent 4 (the maximum order of an element is 4) and possesses 7 elements of order 2 (involutions). Among the non-abelian groups of order 16, the only one with these properties is the group with GAP Small Group ID (16,3), which has the structure $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_4$ (a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 4 by another cyclic group of order 4). It has the presentation $\\langle a,b \\mid a^4=1, b^4=1, bab^{-1}=a^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFinal answer: The question asks for the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, which is standardly interpreted as the Galois group of the Galois closure of $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This group is isomorphic to the group with structure $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\n<<<The Galois group of the Galois closure of $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}) \\rtimes (\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})$, a non-abelian group of order 16 given by the presentation $\\langle a,b \\mid a^4=1, b^4=1, bab^{-1}=a^{-1} \\rangle$.>>>"
