In scalar field theories below the upper critical dimension of four (*d* < 4), the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with the spatial dimensionality, *d*, according to the relation derived from the epsilon expansion (ε = 4 - *d*). To the first order in ε, this scaling is given by the formula:

**α ≈ [(4 - n) / (2(n + 8))]ε**  or  **α ≈ [(4 - n) / (2(n + 8))](4 - *d*)**

Here, *n* represents the number of components of the scalar field (the spin dimensionality), which defines the universality class of the critical phenomenon. This shows that α scales linearly with the deviation from the upper critical dimension.
