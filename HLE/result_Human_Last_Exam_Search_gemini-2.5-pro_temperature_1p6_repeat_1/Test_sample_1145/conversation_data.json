    "The user is asking for the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval for a given quantum number.\n\n1.  **Identify the key concepts:**\n    *   Particle in a 1D box.\n    *   Probability of finding the particle.\n    *   Wavefunction (ψ).\n    *   Probability density (ψ²).\n    *   Specific interval (0.495a to 0.505a).\n    *   Quantum number (n=2).\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for the wavefunction of a particle in a 1D box:**\n    The search results confirm that the wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\n    ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a) \n\n3.  **Specify the wavefunction for n=2:**\n    ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\n4.  **Recall the formula for the probability:**\n    The probability of finding the particle in an interval from x₁ to x₂ is the integral of the probability density, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n    P(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[x₁ to x₂] |ψ(x)|² dx\n\n5.  **Set up the integral for the given problem:**\n    *   n = 2\n    *   x₁ = 0.495a\n    *   x₂ = 0.505a\n    *   |ψ₂(x)|² = (√(2/a) * sin(2πx/a))² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\n    P(0.495a ≤ x ≤ 0.505a) = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n6.  **Solve the integral:**\n    *   Use the trigonometric identity: sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2\n    *   Here, θ = 2πx/a, so 2θ = 4πx/a.\n    *   (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) = (2/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)]/2 = (1/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)]\n\n    P = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (1/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\n    P = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π) * sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\n7.  **Evaluate the integral at the limits:**\n    *   Upper limit (x = 0.505a):\n        (1/a) * [0.505a - (a/4π) * sin(4π * 0.505a / a)]\n        = 0.505 - (1/4π) * sin(2.02π)\n    *   Lower limit (x = 0.495a):\n        (1/a) * [0.495a - (a/4π) * sin(4π * 0.495a / a)]\n        = 0.495 - (1/4π) * sin(1.98π)\n\n8.  **Calculate the difference:**\n    P = [0.505 - (1/4π) * sin(2.02π)] - [0.495 - (1/4π) * sin(1.98π)]\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\n9.  **Use approximations for small Δx around the center (a/2):**\n    Alternatively, since the interval is very small and centered around x = a/2, we can approximate the probability by:\n    P ≈ |ψ₂(a/2)|² * Δx\n    *   x = a/2\n    *   Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a\n    *   ψ₂(a/2) = √(2/a) * sin(2π(a/2)/a) = √(2/a) * sin(π) = 0.\n    *   This approximation gives P ≈ 0. This seems incorrect. Let's re-check the reasoning. The probability density at x=a/2 for n=2 is indeed zero (it's a node). The interval is centered at this node.\n\n10. **Re-evaluate the integral without approximation.**\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π)]\n    Using sin(A+B) and sin(A-B) identities:\n    sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(2π)cos(0.02π) + cos(2π)sin(0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\n    sin(2π - 0.02π) = sin(2π)cos(0.02π) - cos(2π)sin(0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]\n    P = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\n11. **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    *   0.02π is a small angle, so sin(x) ≈ x for small x.\n    *   sin(0.02π) ≈ 0.02π\n    *   P ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * (0.02π)\n    *   P ≈ 0.01 - 0.01 = 0.\n\n    Let's re-examine the integral of the cosine term.\n    Let u = 4πx/a, du = (4π/a)dx.\n    ∫ sin²(2πx/a) dx = (a/4π) ∫ sin²(u) du is wrong.\n\n    Let's go back to:\n    P = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (1/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\n    P = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π) * sin(4πx/a)] from 0.495a to 0.505a\n    P = [(0.505a/a) - (1/4π) * sin(4π*0.505a/a)] - [(0.495a/a) - (1/4π) * sin(4π*0.495a/a)]\n    P = [0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π)] - [0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π)]\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\n    As before:\n    sin(2.02π) = sin(0.02π)\n    sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * 2sin(0.02π)\n    P = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\n    Let's use a calculator for the values.\n    sin(0.02π) = sin(0.06283) ≈ 0.06281\n    P ≈ 0.01 - (1 / (2 * 3.14159)) * 0.06281\n    P ≈ 0.01 - (0.15915) * 0.06281\n    P ≈ 0.01 - 0.00999... ≈ 0.0000...\n    This seems too low.\n\n    Let's re-think the small interval approximation.\n    P ≈ |ψ₂(x)|² * Δx where x is the midpoint of the interval.\n    x_mid = (0.495a + 0.505a)/2 = 0.5a\n    Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a\n    P_density(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n    P_density(0.5a) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a)/a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = 0.\n    The probability density is zero at the center of the interval. However, it's not zero within the interval on either side of the center.\n    The approximation P ≈ f(x_mid) * Δx is only good if the function is roughly constant over the interval. Here, the function is zero at the center and peaks near the edges of this small interval.\n\n    So, we must use the exact integral result.\n    P = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\n    Wait, sin(1.98π) is negative. sin(2.02π) is positive.\n    sin(1.98π) = sin(-0.02π) = -sin(0.02π).  Correct.\n    So, [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] = [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))] = 2sin(0.02π). Correct.\n\n    Where could the error be? Let's check the integral again.\n    ∫ sin²(kx) dx = ∫ (1/2)(1-cos(2kx)) dx = (1/2) * [x - (1/2k)sin(2kx)]\n    Here k = 2π/a.\n    ∫ (2/a)sin²(2πx/a) dx = (2/a) * (1/2) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)]\n    = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)]\n    = (x/a) - (1/4π)sin(4πx/a)\n    This seems correct.\n\n    Let's evaluate it again.\n    At x = 0.505a: (0.505) - (1/4π)sin(4π * 0.505) = 0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π)\n    At x = 0.495a: (0.495) - (1/4π)sin(4π * 0.495) = 0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π)\n    Difference:\n    (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/4π)[sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n    = 0.01 - (1/4π)[2sin(0.02π)]\n    = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\n    Let's try a Taylor expansion for sin around the midpoint x=a/2.\n    P_density(x) = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a)\n    Let x = a/2 + ε, where ε is small.\n    2πx/a = 2π(a/2 + ε)/a = π + 2πε/a\n    sin(π + 2πε/a) = -sin(2πε/a)\n    sin²(π + 2πε/a) = sin²(2πε/a)\n    For small arguments, sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n    So sin²(2πε/a) ≈ (2πε/a)² = 4π²ε²/a²\n    P_density(a/2 + ε) ≈ (2/a) * (4π²ε²/a²) = 8π²ε²/a³\n\n    Now we need to integrate this approximation from ε = -0.005a to ε = +0.005a.\n    P = ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] (8π²ε²/a³) dε\n    P = (8π²/a³) * [ε³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\n    P = (8π²/a³) * 2 * (0.005a)³/3\n    P = (16π² / (3a³)) * (0.005)³ * a³\n    P = (16π² / 3) * (5 x 10⁻³)³\n    P = (16π² / 3) * 125 x 10⁻⁹\n    P = (16 * 9.87 / 3) * 125 * 10⁻⁹\n    P ≈ (52.64) * 125 * 10⁻⁹\n    P ≈ 6580 * 10⁻⁹ = 6.58 * 10⁻⁶\n\n    This seems very small. Let's recalculate with the first method.\n    P = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n    Let's use more precision.\n    0.02 * π = 0.06283185\n    sin(0.06283185) = 0.062791\n    1/(2π) = 0.1591549\n    P = 0.01 - (0.1591549 * 0.062791)\n    P = 0.01 - 0.0099933\n    P = 0.0000067\n\n    Okay, the values are consistent.\n    P = 6.7 x 10⁻⁶. This is very small.\n\n    Let's re-read the question carefully.\n    \"probability that the particle in the 1D box is located in an interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n = 2\"\n    Everything seems correct.\n    n=2 state has a node at x=a/2. The interval is centered on this node. Therefore, the probability should be very small. The math seems to confirm this.\n\n    Let's redo the integral calculation one more time just to be absolutely sure.\n    The indefinite integral of (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx is (x/a) - (1/4π)sin(4πx/a).\n    Let's check the derivative:\n    d/dx [ (x/a) - (1/4π)sin(4πx/a) ]\n    = 1/a - (1/4π) * cos(4πx/a) * (4π/a)\n    = 1/a - (1/a) * cos(4πx/a)\n    = (1/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)]\n    This is (2/a) * (1/2) * [1 - cos(2 * (2πx/a))]\n    = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n    So the integral is correct.\n\n    Evaluation at the limits:\n    F(x) = (x/a) - (1/4π)sin(4πx/a)\n    F(0.505a) = 0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π)\n    F(0.495a) = 0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π)\n    P = F(0.505a) - F(0.495a)\n    P = (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/4π)[sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\n    P = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\n    So we need to calculate 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π).\n    Using python to calculate this value.\n    import numpy as np\n    prob = 0.01 - np.sin(0.02 * np.pi) / (2 * np.pi)\n    prob = 0.01 - 0.06279051952931337 / 6.283185307179586\n    prob = 0.01 - 0.00999345025732236\n    prob = 6.54974267764e-06\n\n    This is the result from direct integration.\n\n    Let's check the Taylor expansion approximation result again.\n    P ≈ (16π² / 3) * (0.005)³\n    P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (0.000125)\n    P ≈ (52.6378) * (0.000125)\n    P ≈ 0.0000065797\n    P ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\n    The results are very close, which gives confidence. The slight difference comes from the `sin(x) ~ x` and `sin^2(x) ~ x^2` approximations used in the second method. The direct integration method is more exact.\n\n    So the probability is approximately 6.55 x 10⁻⁶, which is 0.00000655 or about 0.000655%.\n    This is a very small probability, which is expected because the interval is centered on a node of the n=2 wavefunction.\n\n    To be complete, let's write down the steps clearly.\n    1.  Wavefunction for n=2: ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a).\n    2.  Probability density: P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a).\n    3.  Probability in interval [0.495a, 0.505a]: P = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx.\n    4.  Use integral identity: ∫ sin²(ku) du = u/2 - sin(2ku)/(4k).\n        So ∫ (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx = (2/a) * [x/2 - sin(4πx/a)/(8π/a)] = x/a - sin(4πx/a)/(4π).\n    5.  Evaluate definite integral:\n        P = [x/a - sin(4πx/a)/(4π)] from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n        P = [(0.505a/a - sin(4π(0.505a)/a)/(4π))] - [(0.495a/a - sin(4π(0.495a)/a)/(4π))]\n        P = [0.505 - sin(2.02π)/(4π)] - [0.495 - sin(1.98π)/(4π)]\n        P = 0.01 - [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] / (4π)\n        P = 0.01 - [sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π)] / (4π)\n        P = 0.01 - [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))] / (4π)\n        P = 0.01 - [2 * sin(0.02π)] / (4π)\n        P = 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π)\n    6.  Calculate the final value.\n        P ≈ 0.01 - (0.06279) / (6.2832) ≈ 0.01 - 0.009993 ≈ 0.0000067.\n    Rounding to a reasonable number of significant figures, 0.00000655.\n    The question asks for the probability, not the percentage.\n    Final check of the calculations seems fine. The result is small, as expected.\n    The final answer is a number.To find the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in a specific interval, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval.\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the quantum state n = 2, the wavefunction is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude:\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a is the integral of the probability density over this range:\nProbability = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity:\nsin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2\n\nIn this case, θ = 2πx/a, so the integrand becomes:\n(2/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)]/2 = (1/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)]\n\nNow, we integrate this expression:\nProbability = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (1/a) [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\nProbability = (1/a) [x - (a/4π) sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nNow we evaluate the integral at the upper and lower bounds:\nUpper bound (x = 0.505a):\n(1/a) [0.505a - (a/4π) sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] = 0.505 - (1/4π) sin(2.02π)\n\nLower bound (x = 0.495a):\n(1/a) [0.495a - (a/4π) sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] = 0.495 - (1/4π) sin(1.98π)\n\nThe probability is the difference between the evaluation at the upper and lower bounds:\nProbability = [0.505 - (1/4π) sin(2.02π)] - [0.495 - (1/4π) sin(1.98π)]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\nUsing trigonometric identities sin(2π + x) = sin(x) and sin(2π - x) = -sin(x):\nsin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation:\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) [2sin(0.02π)]\nProbability = 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π)\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value:\nsin(0.02π) ≈ 0.06279\n2π ≈ 6.2832\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - 0.06279 / 6.2832\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - 0.0099933\nProbability ≈ 0.0000067\n\nFor the n=2 state, the wavefunction has a node (a point of zero probability) at x = a/2. Since the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is centered on this node, the probability of finding the particle there is expected to be very small.\n\n<<<0.0000067>>>"
