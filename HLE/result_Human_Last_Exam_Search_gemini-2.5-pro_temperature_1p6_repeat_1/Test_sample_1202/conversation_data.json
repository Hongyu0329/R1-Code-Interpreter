    "After a gene duplication event, the two resulting gene copies are initially identical and therefore functionally redundant. The most common evolutionary fate for one of these copies is **pseudogenization** (B), where it accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional. However, this process leads to the loss of one copy, not the retention of both.\n\nFor both duplicate genes to be maintained in the genome, there must be a mechanism that preserves them. The primary models that explain both the retention and subsequent functional divergence of these duplicates are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** (C) is an adaptive process where one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. While this is a significant path for the evolution of novel traits, it relies on the relatively rare occurrence of an advantageous mutation happening before the redundant copy is silenced.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization** (D), particularly the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, proposes that the two gene copies each lose different sub-functions of the original ancestral gene through complementary degenerative mutations. As a result, both genes are now required to perform the full set of original functions. This is a neutral process, meaning it does not require an advantageous new mutation for the genes to be preserved. This makes it a highly plausible and common mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **Gene conversion** (A) is a mechanism of DNA recombination that can lead to one sequence in a duplicate pair being replaced by the other, which can either homogenize the genes or create new gene variants. It is a force that acts on duplicated sequences but is not considered a primary model explaining their initial retention and functional partitioning in the way subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization are.\n\n*   **Adaptive radiation** (E) is a macroevolutionary process where a single ancestral species diversifies into multiple new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. This process relates to the evolution of species, not the retention of duplicate genes within a single genome.\n\nComparing the options, both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, many evolutionary models suggest that subfunctionalization provides a crucial pathway for preserving both gene copies from being lost through pseudogenization, thereby giving them the evolutionary time to potentially evolve new functions (neofunctionalization). Because subfunctionalization relies on more common, neutral mutations to partition ancestral functions, it is often considered a more widespread and immediate mechanism for ensuring the survival of both gene copies after a duplication event.\n\n<<<D>>>"
