    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly and efficiently synthesized by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases in a nickel container. The reaction is typically carried out by heating a mixture of the elements, with a xenon to fluorine molar ratio of about 1:5, to a temperature of 400°C (752°F). This method was used in the original synthesis of XeF₄ in 1962.\n\nThe reaction is exothermic and can be represented by the chemical equation:\n\nXe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\n\nWhile the reaction can occur over a range of temperatures, typically between 350°C and 450°C, 400°C is the most frequently cited temperature for obtaining a good yield of XeF₄. Temperatures lower than this tend to favor the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂), while higher temperatures can lead to the production of xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n\nOther methods for synthesizing XeF₄ exist, but they are generally less common or result in product mixtures. For instance, flow methods passing the gases through a nickel tube heated to 300-500°C have been used, but can result in contamination with XeF₂. Another method involves the reaction of xenon with dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂) at temperatures between 140 K and 195 K (-133°C to -78°C). However, the direct heating of xenon and fluorine at 400°C remains the most established and efficient method for producing xenon tetrafluoride.\n\nConsidering the provided options, 400°C is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently through its most common synthesis route.\n\n<<<B>>>"
