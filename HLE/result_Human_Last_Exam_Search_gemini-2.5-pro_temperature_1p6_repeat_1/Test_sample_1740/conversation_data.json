    "To date, there are between nine and twelve members of the let-7 family that have been identified in humans. The exact number can vary depending on whether the count refers to mature microRNAs or the gene loci that encode them.\n\nSeveral sources state that there are ten unique mature let-7 family members: let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, mir-98, and mir-202. However, other studies identify nine mature let-7 family members (let-7a-g, let-7i, and miR-98).\n\nThe discrepancy can be partially explained by the distinction between the mature miRNA sequences and their genetic origins. For instance, it has been reported that twelve distinct genomic loci encode for nine mature let-7 miRNAs. Another source mentions that the let-7 family in humans is comprised of 13 precursor genes that give rise to the mature miRNAs. Adding to this complexity, one source from 2021 states the family consists of 12 members. An earlier paper from 2007 had already mentioned that the human let-7 family is made up of 11 closely related genes.\n\nIn summary, while the number of mature let-7 miRNAs is most frequently cited as nine or ten, the number of corresponding genes or genomic loci is slightly higher, leading to the range of reported members.\n\n<<<Between 9 and 12>>>"
