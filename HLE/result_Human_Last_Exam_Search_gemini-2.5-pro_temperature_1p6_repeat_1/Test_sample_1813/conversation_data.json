    "The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is the numerator of a palindromic continued fraction that is constructed based on the rational number p/q. This continued fraction is derived from the \"Markov snake graph\" associated with the Christoffel path of slope p/q.\n\nFor the specific case of \\( p/q = 4/7 \\), the associated continued fraction is \\(\\).\n\nTo verify, we can compute the numerator of this continued fraction using the recurrence relation for continuants, \\(K_n = a_n K_{n-1} + K_{n-2}\\), with initial values \\(K_{-1}=0\\) and \\(K_0=1\\).\n\nLet the continued fraction be \\([c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{12}] =\\). The convergents' numerators are:\n*   K(2) = 2\n*   K(2, 2) = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5\n*   K(2, 2, 2) = 2 * 5 + 2 = 12\n*   K(2, 2, 2, 1) = 1 * 12 + 5 = 17\n*   K(2, 2, 2, 1, 1) = 1 * 17 + 12 = 29\n*   K(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2) = 2 * 29 + 17 = 75\n*   K(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2) = 2 * 75 + 29 = 179\n*   K(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1) = 1 * 179 + 75 = 254\n*   K(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1) = 1 * 254 + 179 = 433\n*   K(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2) = 2 * 433 + 254 = 1120\n*   K(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2) = 2 * 1120 + 433 = 2673\n*   K(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2) = 2 * 2673 + 1120 = 5346 + 1120 = 6466\n\nThe numerator of this continued fraction is 6466. Therefore, the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is 6466, and its associated continued fraction is.\n\n<<<\\(\\)>>>"
