The interaction between the human voltage-gated calcium channel alpha-1 subunit and beta-1 subunit involves key residues. For interaction, Leucine 223, Leucine 326, Leucine 360, Leucine 365, and Arginine 330 in the beta-1 subunit's Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain are critical. For fine-tuning gating properties, the GK domain, the N-terminal Lysine 3 and Lysine 4, and phosphorylated Serine 193 and Threonine 205 in the HOOK domain of the beta-1 subunit are important hotspots.
