    "Let $J$ be an upper semilattice and $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ be a tame functor, where $\\text{Vect}_K$ is the category of $K$-vector spaces. The term *n*-resolvable refers to the length of the minimal projective resolution of the functor $f$ in the category of functors from $J$ to $\\text{Vect}_K$.\n\nFor a functor to be *n*-resolvable means that its homological dimension is at most *n*. The category of representations of an upper semilattice, which are functors into $\\text{Vect}_K$, has a global dimension of at most 1. This is a consequence of the algebraic structure of the category of functors on an upper semilattice. In this context, the category of tame functors, `tame(J, Vect_K)`, is an abelian category where every object has a minimal free resolution.\n\nThe homological dimension for tame vector space-valued functors indexed by upper semilattices can be computed using tools like Koszul complexes, which highlights their well-behaved homological nature. For the specific case of one-parameter persistence, where the indexing poset is a total order (a simple type of upper semilattice), any tame persistence module has a projective resolution of length at most 1. This property generalizes to all upper semilattices.\n\nBecause the global dimension of the category of representations of an upper semilattice is at most 1, every object within that category, including any tame functor, admits a projective resolution of length at most 1.\n\nTherefore, the functor $f$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
