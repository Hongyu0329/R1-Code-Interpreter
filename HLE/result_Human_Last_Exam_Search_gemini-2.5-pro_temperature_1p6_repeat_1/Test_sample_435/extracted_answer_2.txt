Based on the evidence, I would predict that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit a more robust and polyfunctional cytokine release upon antigen stimulation, characterized by higher levels of key effector cytokines like IFNγ and TNF-α, compared to T cells manufactured without IL-15. This is likely to enhance their anti-tumor efficacy. However, this heightened functionality is also predicted to lead to a greater potential for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), although some studies suggest the cytokine profile might be more favorable and less toxic than when using IL-2 for manufacturing.
