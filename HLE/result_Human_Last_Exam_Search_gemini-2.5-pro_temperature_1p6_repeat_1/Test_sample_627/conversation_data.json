    "Vogel's algorithm is a method for constructing a closed braid representation of a knot from a given knot diagram. The number of strands in the resulting braid provides an upper bound for the knot's braid index, which is the minimum number of strands required to represent the knot as a closed braid.\n\nThe three-twist knot, also known as the 5₂ knot, is a prime knot with a crossing number of five. While the minimal braid index of the three-twist knot is known to be 3, the application of Vogel's algorithm to a standard diagram of this knot results in a braid with a higher number of strands. Therefore, the result from Vogel's algorithm provides an upper bound, but not the tightest possible one.\n\nA detailed application of the Yamada-Vogel algorithm on the 5₂ knot is illustrated in a dissertation by Sophia Lopes Ribeiro Fiorotto. Visual inspection of the resulting braid diagram in this source (specifically Figure 3.9) indicates that it is a 4-strand braid. This means that Vogel's algorithm gives an upper bound of 4 for the braid index of the three-twist knot.\n\n<<<B>>>"
