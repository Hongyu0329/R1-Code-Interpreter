    "The English surname that appears in the Russian version of an essay describing the wide boulevards of Vienna is **Pope**.\n\nThis is a well-known literary pun from the Russian-American Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. After being exiled from the Soviet Union in 1972, Brodsky's first stop was Vienna. He captured his impressions of the city in his prose.\n\nIn the Russian-language version of his essay \"Journey to Istanbul\" (\"Путешествие в Стамбул\"), Brodsky describes the Viennese boulevards. He employs a pun, writing that the boulevards were so wide they could accommodate not only crowds of people but a \"толпу попов\" (*tolpu popov*).\n\nIn Russian, \"поп\" (*pop*) means an Orthodox priest, so \"толпу попов\" literally translates to \"a crowd of priests.\" However, \"Попов\" is also the genitive plural of \"Поуп\" (*Poup*), the Russian rendering of the English surname Pope. The line is a clever, multilingual play on words, alluding to the 18th-century English poet Alexander Pope.\n\n<<<Pope>>>"
