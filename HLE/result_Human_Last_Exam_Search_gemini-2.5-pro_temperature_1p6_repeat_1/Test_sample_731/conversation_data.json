    "The user is asking for the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n1.  **Define Semidihedral Group SD_512**:\n    *   The semidihedral group of order 2^n, denoted SD_{2^n} or QD_{2^n}, has the presentation: <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1)>.\n    *   For SD_512, the order is 512 = 2^9, so n=9.\n    *   The presentation is <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(128-1) = r^127>.\n    *   The elements are of the form r^i s^j where 0 <= i < 256 and j in {0, 1}.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroup**:\n    *   For a group H and a positive integer q, the q-th power subgroup, denoted H^q, is the subgroup generated by the set of all q-th powers of elements of H: H^q = <h^q | h in H>.\n\n3.  **Analyze the elements of SD_512**:\n    *   The group SD_512 has two types of elements: those in the cyclic subgroup <r> of order 256, and those of the form r^i * s.\n    *   Let's analyze the powers of these elements.\n\n4.  **Calculate powers of elements in SD_512**:\n    *   Elements of the form r^i: (r^i)^q = r^(iq). These generate subgroups of the cyclic group <r>. The subgroups of <r> (which is C_256) are cyclic and have orders dividing 256. These are of the form <r^d> where d divides 256. The divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. This gives 9 such subgroups.\n    *   Elements of the form r^i * s:\n        *   (r^i * s)^2 = r^i * s * r^i * s = r^i * (s * r^i * s) = r^i * r^(i*(2^(n-2)-1)) = r^i * r^(i*127) = r^(128i).\n        *   Since i can be any integer from 0 to 255, r^(128i) can be r^0=e or r^128. So, the squares of elements outside <r> are either e or r^128.\n        *   (r^i * s)^q:\n            *   If q is even, q=2k: ((r^i*s)^2)^k = (r^(128i))^k = r^(128ik).\n            *   If q is odd, q=2k+1: ((r^i*s)^2)^k * (r^i*s) = r^(128ik) * r^i * s = r^(128ik+i) * s.\n\n5.  **Determine the Power Subgroups G^q**:\n    *   We need to find the subgroups generated by {g^q | g in G}.\n    *   This is the subgroup generated by { (r^i)^q } union { (r^i*s)^q }.\n    *   So, G^q = < {r^(iq)} U { (r^i*s)^q } | 0 <= i < 256 >.\n\n    *   **Case q=1**: G^1 = G = SD_512.\n    *   **Case q is odd (q > 1)**:\n        *   The set of q-th powers is {r^(iq)} U {r^(i(128(q-1)/2 + 1)) * s}.\n        *   Since q is odd, gcd(q, 256) = 1. So {r^(iq)} generates all of <r>.\n        *   The element `s` is in the set of generators (for i=0).\n        *   Since <r> and `s` generate the whole group SD_512, for any odd q, G^q = G.\n\n    *   **Case q is even (q = 2k)**:\n        *   The set of q-th powers is { r^(iq) } U { r^(128ik) }.\n        *   r^(128ik) is always a power of r^(128k).\n        *   r^(iq) = r^(i*2k).\n        *   So G^(2k) = < {r^(i*2k)} U {r^(128ik)} >.\n        *   Let d = gcd(2k, 128k). The subgroup is generated by r^d.\n        *   This is incorrect. The subgroup is generated by the *set* of elements.\n        *   G^q = <r^(iq) for all i, and (r^i*s)^q for all i>.\n        *   When q is even, (r^i * s)^q = ( (r^i * s)^2 )^(q/2) = (r^(128i))^(q/2) = r^(64iq).\n        *   The set of generators for G^q is {r^(iq)} U {r^(64iq)}.\n        *   The subgroup generated by {r^(iq) | 0 <= i < 256} is <r^gcd(q, 256)>.\n        *   The subgroup generated by {r^(64iq) | 0 <= i < 256} is <r^gcd(64q, 256)>.\n        *   So, G^q = <r^gcd(q, 256)>. Since q is even, let q = 2^j * m where m is odd.\n        *   gcd(q, 256) = gcd(2^j * m, 2^8) = 2^j.\n        *   So, G^q = <r^(2^j)>.\n\n    *   Let's check the values of j for q from 2 up to the exponent of the group. The exponent of SD_512 is 256.\n    *   The possible values for 2^j are 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8.\n    *   So we have the following power subgroups when q is even:\n        *   q = 2, 6, 10, ... (j=1, m odd): G^q = <r^2>\n        *   q = 4, 12, 20, ... (j=2, m odd): G^q = <r^4>\n        *   q = 8, 24, 40, ... (j=3, m odd): G^q = <r^8>\n        *   q = 16, 48, ... (j=4, m odd): G^q = <r^16>\n        *   q = 32, 96, ... (j=5, m odd): G^q = <r^32>\n        *   q = 64, 192, ... (j=6, m odd): G^q = <r^64>\n        *   q = 128, ... (j=7, m odd): G^q = <r^128>\n        *   q = 256, ... (j=8, m odd): G^q = <r^256> = {e}.\n\n    *   This gives us 8 distinct subgroups of the form <r^(2^j)>.\n    *   What about q=0? This is not usually considered for power subgroups. But if it were, G^0 = {e}.\n    *   What about q >= exponent? If q is a multiple of the exponent (256), then g^q = e for all g, so G^q = {e}.\n    *   The distinct power subgroups are:\n        1.  G^1 = SD_512 (for all odd q)\n        2.  G^2 = <r^2>\n        3.  G^4 = <r^4>\n        4.  G^8 = <r^8>\n        5.  G^16 = <r^16>\n        6.  G^32 = <r^32>\n        7.  G^64 = <r^64>\n        8.  G^128 = <r^128>\n        9.  G^256 = <r^256> = {e}\n\nLet's re-verify the calculation of (r^i*s)^q when q is even.\nq = 2k.\n(r^i*s)^q = ((r^i*s)^2)^k = (r^(128i))^k = r^(128ik).\nThis should be r^(i * 128 * q/2) = r^(64iq).\nSo G^q = < {r^(iq)} U {r^(64iq)} > = <r^gcd(q, 256), r^gcd(64q, 256)>.\nLet q = 2^j * m, m is odd.\ngcd(q, 256) = 2^j.\ngcd(64q, 256) = gcd(2^6 * 2^j * m, 2^8) = gcd(2^(j+6), 2^8) = 2^min(j+6, 8).\nSo G^q = <r^(2^j), r^(2^min(j+6, 8))>.\nSince r^(2^min(j+6, 8)) is a power of r^(2^j), the subgroup is just <r^(2^j)>.\nThis confirms my previous finding.\n\nThe possible values for j are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nThis gives 8 cyclic subgroups: <r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^256> = {e}.\nAnd for q odd, we get G^q = SD_512.\nAnd what about the trivial subgroup {e}? It is G^256.\nWhat about the whole group G? It is G^1.\n\nSo the set of distinct power subgroups is:\n{ SD_512, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, {e} }\nThere are 1 + 8 = 9 power subgroups.\n\nLet's be careful. Is it possible that for some `q`, `G^q` is not in this list?\n\nWe have considered q being odd and q being a power of 2 times an odd number. This covers all positive integers q.\n\nThe list of subgroups is:\n1.  SD_512\n2.  <r^2>\n3.  <r^4>\n4.  <r^8>\n5.  <r^16>\n6.  <r^32>\n7.  <r^64>\n8.  <r^128>\n9.  {e} = <r^256>\n\nThese are all distinct subgroups. So the count is 9.\nI've defined the group, defined power subgroups, calculated the generating sets for the power subgroups for all possible integer powers q, and listed the resulting unique subgroups. The reasoning seems sound.\nLet's double-check the definition of the semidihedral group of size 512.\nSD_512 = SD_{2^9}. n=9.\nPresentation: <r, s | r^(2^(9-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(9-2) - 1)>\n= <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(128 - 1) = r^127>. This is correct.\nThe elements are r^i and r^i * s for i in {0, ..., 255}.\n\nPower subgroups G^q = <g^q | g in G>.\n\nIf g = r^i, g^q = r^(iq). The set of these powers for all i generates <r^gcd(q, 256)>.\nIf g = r^i*s, we need to calculate g^q.\n(r^i*s)^2 = r^i * s*r^i*s = r^i * r^(i*127) = r^(128i).\nIf q is even, q=2k: g^q = ((r^i*s)^2)^k = (r^(128i))^k = r^(128ik) = r^(64iq).\nIf q is odd, q=2k+1: g^q = ((r^i*s)^2)^k * (r^i*s) = r^(128ik) * r^i*s = r^(128ik+i)*s = r^(i(128k+1))*s.\n\nSo for q=2k (even):\nG^q = < {r^(i(2k))} U {r^(i(128k))} | i in {0..255} >.\nG^q = < <r^gcd(2k, 256)>, <r^gcd(128k, 256)> >.\nLet q = 2k = 2^j * m (m odd, j>=1). Then k = 2^(j-1)*m.\ngcd(2k, 256) = gcd(2^j*m, 2^8) = 2^j.\ngcd(128k, 256) = gcd(2^7 * 2^(j-1)*m, 2^8) = gcd(2^(j+6)*m, 2^8) = 2^min(j+6, 8).\nG^q = < r^(2^j), r^(2^min(j+6, 8)) >.\nSince j>=1, j+6 >= 7. min(j+6, 8) is either 7 or 8. In any case, min(j+6, 8) >= j.\nSo r^(2^min(j+6, 8)) is a power of r^(2^j).\nTherefore, G^q = <r^(2^j)>.\nThe possible values for j are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. For j>=9, q would be a multiple of 512, but we only need to consider q up to the exponent, 256. If q=256, j=8, m=1. G^256 = <r^256> = {e}.\nThis gives the 8 subgroups: <r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^256>={e}.\n\nNow for q=2k+1 (odd):\nThe generators are {r^(i(2k+1))} and {r^(i(128k+1))*s}.\nThe first set {r^(i(2k+1))} generates <r^gcd(2k+1, 256)>. Since 2k+1 is odd, the gcd is 1. So this set generates <r>.\nThe second set includes the element s (for i=0).\nSo the generators include all of <r> and also s.\nTherefore, G^q = < <r>, s > = SD_512.\n\nThe set of power subgroups is:\n{ SD_512, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, <r^256> }\nwhere <r^256> is the trivial subgroup {e}.\nThis gives a total of 1 + 8 = 9 subgroups.\nThe analysis appears solid. I'm ready to write the final answer.\nIn the semidihedral group of size 512, there are 9 power subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD_512, can be represented by the presentation:\nG = ⟨r, s | r²⁵⁶ = s² = 1, srs = r¹²⁷⟩.\n\nA power subgroup Gᵏ is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G. We can determine the set of all unique power subgroups by considering two cases for the integer k.\n\n1.  **When k is an odd number:** The k-th power of any element in the cyclic subgroup ⟨r⟩ will generate ⟨r⟩ itself, because k is coprime to the order of r (which is 256). The set of k-th powers will also include elements of the form (rⁱs)ᵏ, which includes 's' itself (when i=0). Therefore, the subgroup generated will be the entire group, ⟨r, s⟩ = SD_512. This gives one power subgroup for all odd k.\n\n2.  **When k is an even number:** Let k = 2ʲm, where m is an odd integer and j ≥ 1. The subgroup Gᵏ will be a cyclic subgroup of ⟨r⟩. Specifically, Gᵏ is equal to the cyclic subgroup ⟨r²ʲ⟩. Since the order of r is 256 (which is 2⁸), the possible values for j are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Each of these values for j yields a distinct cyclic subgroup:\n    *   ⟨r²⟩\n    *   ⟨r⁴⟩\n    *   ⟨r⁸⟩\n    *   ⟨r¹⁶⟩\n    *   ⟨r³²⟩\n    *   ⟨r⁶⁴⟩\n    *   ⟨r¹²⁸⟩\n    *   ⟨r²⁵⁶⟩, which is the trivial subgroup {e}.\n\nThis gives 8 distinct power subgroups for even values of k.\n\nCombining the two cases, we have 1 subgroup from the odd powers (SD_512 itself) and 8 distinct subgroups from the even powers.\n\nThus, the total number of distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512 is 1 + 8 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
