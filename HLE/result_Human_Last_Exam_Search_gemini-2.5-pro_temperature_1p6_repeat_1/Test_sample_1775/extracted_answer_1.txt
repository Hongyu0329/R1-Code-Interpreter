The displacement field through the transistor is the superposition of the fields from the top and bottom gates. As these fields are in opposite directions, the net displacement field, D, is given by the difference between the displacement fields generated by the back gate and the top gate. Taking the direction from the back gate to the top gate as positive, the displacement field is:
$D = C_{bg}V_{bg} - C_{tg}V_{tg}$
