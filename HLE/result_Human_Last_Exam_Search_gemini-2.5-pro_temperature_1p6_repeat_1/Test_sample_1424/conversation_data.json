    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, represents the propagator of a single particle in the absence of interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ, can be determined by considering a non-interacting system.\n\nFor a non-interacting many-body system, the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators for single-particle states with definite energy:\nH₀ = ∑ₖ ϵₖ c†ₖ cₖ\nwhere c†ₖ and cₖ are the creation and annihilation operators for a particle in a state with momentum or other quantum number *k*, and ϵₖ is the corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n\nThe bare two-point Green's function G₀(k, t' - t) is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of a creation and an annihilation operator. In the path integral formalism, this is calculated as a functional integral over fields weighted by the exponential of the free action, S₀. After performing a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency (or energy) domain, the Green's function in frequency-momentum space, G₀(k, ω), is obtained.\n\nThe resulting bare Green's function has a characteristic pole structure. The functional dependence of the time-ordered bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ is given by:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) ∝ 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **ω** is the frequency or energy variable.\n*   **ϵₖ** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a given momentum state *k*.\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimally small imaginary term (with δ → 0⁺) that dictates the correct boundary conditions for time-ordering and ensures causality. It displaces the pole slightly off the real axis.\n\nThis expression shows that the bare Green's function has poles at the single-particle energies. In essence, the functional dependence is an inverse relationship with respect to the difference between the energy variable ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ.\n\nFor a relativistic free scalar field, the action leads to a propagator in momentum space of the form i/(p² - m² + iε). In this case, the four-momentum squared is p² = p₀² - **p**², and the energy is p₀. The on-shell condition p₀² - **p**² = m² gives the energy-momentum dispersion relation, so the energy eigenvalues are ϵ**ₚ** = √(**p**² + m²). The denominator of the propagator can be factored as (p₀ - ϵ**ₚ**)(p₀ + ϵ**ₚ**), revealing poles that correspond to the creation of a particle with energy ϵ**ₚ** and an anti-particle with energy -ϵ**ₚ**.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ in the energy-momentum representation is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵₖ), with a small imaginary part (iδ) to enforce causality. The functional form is G₀(k, ω) ∝ 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ).>>>"
