In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ in the energy-momentum representation is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵₖ), with a small imaginary part (iδ) to enforce causality. The functional form is G₀(k, ω) ∝ 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ).
