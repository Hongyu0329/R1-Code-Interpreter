    "The maximum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of a graph is known as its chromatic number, denoted by $\\chi(G)$. For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, so for the given graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, $\\chi(G) \\le 12345$.\n\nA fundamental result in graph theory states that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. A complete graph is one where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. To color $K_n$, every vertex must receive a unique color, thus requiring $n$ colors. Conversely, if a graph is not complete, there exists at least one pair of vertices that are not adjacent. These two vertices can be assigned the same color, meaning that an $(n-1)$-coloring is possible.\n\nThe problem specifies that the graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices and is not the complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$). Based on the principle mentioned above, since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than 12345. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number for $G$ is at most 12344.\n\nTo determine if this maximum is achievable, we need to find an example of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete but requires 12344 colors. Consider the graph $G'$ created by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge between two vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$.\n*   This graph $G'$ has 12345 vertices.\n*   It is not the complete graph because the edge $(u,v)$ is missing.\n*   The maximum degree of this graph, $\\Delta(G')$, is 12344 (all vertices except $u$ and $v$ are connected to every other vertex).\n\nNow, let's determine the chromatic number of $G'$. Since vertices $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color. Let's assign them color 1. All the other $12345 - 2 = 12343$ vertices form a complete subgraph ($K_{12343}$), and each of them is connected to both $u$ and $v$. This means that each of these 12343 vertices must have a color different from color 1, and also different from each other. Therefore, we need 12343 distinct additional colors for these vertices.\n\nIn total, the number of colors required to properly color $G'$ is $1 (for \\ u \\ and \\ v) + 12343 = 12344$. Thus, the chromatic number of $G'$ is $\\chi(G')=12344$.\n\nSince the maximum possible chromatic number for a non-complete graph on 12345 vertices is 12344, and we have found a graph that requires exactly this many colors, this is our maximum. The information about the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ in the problem description is consistent with this analysis but not essential for reaching the final numerical answer.\n\nThe maximum number of colors required is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
