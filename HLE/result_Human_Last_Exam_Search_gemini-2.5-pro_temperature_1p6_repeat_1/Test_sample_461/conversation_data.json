    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **penguinone**.\n\nThis molecule, with the chemical formula C₁₀H₁₄O, is a member of the terpene family of natural products. Its two-dimensional chemical structure coincidentally resembles a penguin. While penguins themselves are not extinct, the name is a playful nod to the shape of the molecule.\n\nIt is important to note that while organic molecules and even fragments of proteins have been found in dinosaur fossils, no specific polycyclic hydrocarbon has been named after a dinosaur or other creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago.\n\n<<<penguinone>>>"
