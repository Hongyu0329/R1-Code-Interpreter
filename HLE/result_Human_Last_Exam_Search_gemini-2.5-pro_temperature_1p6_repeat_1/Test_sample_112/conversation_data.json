    "The poem *Sir Launfal* is preserved in the British Library manuscript MS Cotton Caligula A.ii, which dates from the first half of the fifteenth century. This manuscript is a collection of thirty-eight items, including various poems and ten romances.\n\nAlongside *Sir Launfal*, the manuscript contains works that can be described as \"courtesy poems\" or books of manners. These texts were likely included for the instruction of the members of a household on proper conduct and etiquette. Scholarly work on the manuscript identifies a strong didactic and ethical theme throughout, with the courtesy poems emphasizing the practical and social value of good manners.\n\nWhile a singular \"book of manners\" is not explicitly titled in some descriptions, the collection as a whole is understood to contain instructional texts on courtesy and behavior. One academic work focusing on the manuscript is even titled, \"'Nurtur and good maners makeþ man': The Burgeis in Late-Medieval Household Miscellany BL MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, part 1\".\n\nThe contents of the manuscript immediately surrounding *Sir Launfal* are the romances *Octavian*, which precedes it, and *Libeaus Desconus*, which follows it. The full list of contents for this manuscript includes other notable works such as *Sir Eglamour of Artois* and *Emaré*.\n\n<<<The book of manners Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is not a single, titled volume but rather a collection of \"courtesy poems\" intended for household instruction on etiquette and behavior, which are included in the same manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Caligula A.ii.>>>"
