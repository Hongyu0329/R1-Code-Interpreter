Let \(f_m\) denote the number of sets \(T\) for a given positive integer \(n\). The values of \(f_m\) for \(m \ge 1\) can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:
**Base Case:**
*   \(f_1 = 0\)

**Recurrence Relation for \(m \ge 2\):**
\[ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2} \right) \]
where \(f_0\) is taken to be 1 for the calculation of \(f_2\).
