    "In the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with two replicas, the target space is the supermanifold SpO(4, R|4)/U(2|2). The non-Grassmann variables are the coordinates that parametrize the purely bosonic part of this space.\n\nThe bosonic sector of this supermanifold is composed of two parts: a non-compact sector and a compact sector. Specifically for two replicas (n=2), these are:\n\n*   The non-compact Bose-Bose (BB) sector, which is the symmetric space **Sp(4,R)/U(2)**.\n*   The compact Fermi-Fermi (FF) sector, which is the symmetric space **O(4)/U(2)**.\n\nThe number of non-Grassmann variables is the total dimension of this bosonic manifold, which is the sum of the dimensions of these two constituent spaces.\n\nTo find the dimensions of these spaces, we first determine the dimensions of the groups involved:\n*   The dimension of the symplectic group Sp(2n,R) is given by the formula n(2n+1). For n=2, the dimension of Sp(4,R) is 2(2*2+1) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². For n=2, the dimension of U(2) is 2² = 4.\n*   The dimension of the orthogonal group O(n) is n(n-1)/2. For n=4, the dimension of O(4) is 4(4-1)/2 = 6.\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the dimension of each part of the bosonic sector:\n*   The dimension of the non-compact part is:\n    dim(Sp(4,R)/U(2)) = dim(Sp(4,R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n*   The dimension of the compact part is:\n    dim(O(4)/U(2)) = dim(O(4)) - dim(U(2)) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nThe total number of non-Grassmann variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector is the sum of these dimensions: 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
