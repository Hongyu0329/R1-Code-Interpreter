    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z refers to a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence of such a fixed point have been established in the field of fixed-point theory, particularly as a generalization of coupled and tripled fixed point theorems.\n\nThe foundational conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are established in the context of partially ordered metric spaces. These conditions typically involve the completeness of the metric spaces, a mixed monotone property for the functions, and a contractive-type condition.\n\nLet (X, ⪯) be a partially ordered set and d be a metric on X. Then (X, d, ⪯) is called a partially ordered metric space. The product space X × Y × Z is endowed with a partial order (x, y, z) ⪯ (u, v, w) if and only if x ⪯ u, y ⪰ v, and z ⪯ w. A key requirement is that the metric spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are complete.\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a property known as the **mixed monotone property**. This property relates the ordering of the inputs to the ordering of the outputs of the functions. For F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × Z × X → Y, and H: Z × X × Y → Z, the mixed monotone property is defined as follows: for any x_1, x_2 ∈ X, y_1, y_2 ∈ Y, and z_1, z_2 ∈ Z:\n*   If x_1 ⪯ x_2, y_1 ⪰ y_2, and z_1 ⪯ z_2, then F(x_1, y_1, z_1) ⪯ F(x_2, y_2, z_2).\n*   If y_1 ⪯ y_2, z_1 ⪰ z_2, and x_1 ⪯ x_2, then G(y_1, z_1, x_1) ⪯ G(y_2, z_2, x_2).\n*   If z_1 ⪯ z_2, x_1 ⪰ x_2, and y_1 ⪯ y_2, then H(z_1, x_1, y_1) ⪯ H(z_2, x_2, y_2).\n\nThe core of the conditions is a **contractive inequality** that the functions must satisfy. There exist constants k, m, l ∈ [0, 1) with k + m + l < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ⪰ u, y ⪯ v, and z ⪰ w, the following inequalities hold:\n*   d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ k * d(x, u) + m * d(y, v) + l * d(z, w)\n*   d(G(y, z, x), G(v, w, u)) ≤ k * d(y, v) + m * d(z, w) + l * d(x, u)\n*   d(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ k * d(z, w) + m * d(x, u) + l * d(y, v)\n\nFinally, for the existence of the FGH-tripled fixed point, one of two conditions is generally required:\n1.  F, G, and H are continuous functions.\n2.  The spaces (X, d, ⪯), (Y, d, ⪯), and (Z, d, ⪯) have a regularity property: if a non-decreasing sequence {x_n} converges to x, then x_n ⪯ x for all n. Similarly for non-increasing sequences. This allows the contractive condition to hold in the limit even if the functions are not continuous.\n\nIf these conditions are met, and there exist initial points x_0 ∈ X, y_0 ∈ Y, and z_0 ∈ Z such that x_0 ⪯ F(x_0, y_0, z_0), y_0 ⪰ G(y_0, z_0, x_0), and z_0 ⪯ H(z_0, x_0, y_0), then there exist x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, and z ∈ Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, z, x) = y, and H(z, x, y) = z. To ensure the uniqueness of the fixed point, an additional condition on the comparability of elements in the space is typically needed.\n\nIt is worth noting that the exact formulation of the mixed monotone property and the contractive condition may vary slightly depending on the specific fixed-point theorem, including variations in the function signatures. However, the fundamental principles of a complete metric space, a mixed-monotone-like property, and a contractive condition remain central.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point exists for functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z if the following conditions are met. Firstly, (X, d_X, ⪯_X), (Y, d_Y, ⪯_Y), and (Z, d_Z, ⪯_Z) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. Secondly, the functions F, G, and H need to have the mixed monotone property. This means that the functions preserve or reverse the order of their arguments in a specific manner. For instance, F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second. Thirdly, the functions must satisfy a contractive condition. This is a set of inequalities that bound the distance between the outputs of the functions in terms of the distances between their inputs, moderated by constants that sum to less than one. Finally, either the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the partially ordered metric spaces possess a regularity property that ensures sequences converge in an order-preserving way. If there also exist initial points that satisfy a specific order relationship with their images under F, G, and H, then an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z refers to a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence of such a fixed point have been established in the field of fixed-point theory, particularly as a generalization of coupled and tripled fixed point theorems. [4, 7, 11]\n\nThe foundational conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are established in the context of partially ordered metric spaces. These conditions typically involve the completeness of the metric spaces, a mixed monotone property for the functions, and a contractive-type condition. [4, 9, 11]\n\nLet (X, ⪯) be a partially ordered set and d be a metric on X. Then (X, d, ⪯) is called a partially ordered metric space. The product space X × Y × Z is endowed with a partial order (x, y, z) ⪯ (u, v, w) if and only if x ⪯ u, y ⪰ v, and z ⪯ w.

There exist constants k, m, l ∈ [0, 1) with k + m + l < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ⪰ u, y ⪯ v, and z ⪰ w, the following inequalities hold:\n*   d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ k * d(x, u) + m * d(y, v) + l * d(z, w)\n*   d(G(y, z, x), G(v, w, u)) ≤ k * d(y, v) + m * d(z, w) + l * d(x, u)\n*   d(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ k * d(z, w) + m * d(x, u) + l * d(y, v)\n\nFinally, for the existence of the FGH-tripled fixed point, one of two conditions is generally required:\n1.

[11] To ensure the uniqueness of the fixed point, an additional condition on the comparability of elements in the space is typically needed.
