An FGH-tripled fixed point exists for functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z if the following conditions are met. Firstly, (X, d_X, ⪯_X), (Y, d_Y, ⪯_Y), and (Z, d_Z, ⪯_Z) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. Secondly, the functions F, G, and H need to have the mixed monotone property. This means that the functions preserve or reverse the order of their arguments in a specific manner. For instance, F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second. Thirdly, the functions must satisfy a contractive condition. This is a set of inequalities that bound the distance between the outputs of the functions in terms of the distances between their inputs, moderated by constants that sum to less than one. Finally, either the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the partially ordered metric spaces possess a regularity property that ensures sequences converge in an order-preserving way. If there also exist initial points that satisfy a specific order relationship with their images under F, G, and H, then an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.
