    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the number of logical qubits it can encode, with the relationship being GSD = 2^k, where `k` is the number of logical qubits. The value of `k` depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined, specifically its genus (`g`) and the number and type of its boundaries (or holes).\n\nThere are two types of boundaries in the toric code: smooth and rough. These are also sometimes referred to as closed/dual and open/primal boundaries, respectively. Logical operators can be formed by strings of Pauli operators that connect boundaries of the same type.\n\nThe problem specifies a system with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. Typically, such a system is conceptualized as being on a plane, which is topologically a sphere (genus g=0) with one puncture that serves as the outer boundary. The `n` smooth and `m` rough holes are additional punctures.\n\nLet's determine the number of logical qubits `k`. The general formula for the number of logical qubits on a surface with genus `g`, `n_s` smooth boundaries, and `n_r` rough boundaries is `k = 2g + N - 1`, where `N` is the total number of distinct boundary components.\n\nIn our case, the surface is a plane, so the genus `g=0`. The boundaries consist of the `n` inner smooth holes, the `m` inner rough holes, plus the single outer boundary of the plane. This gives a total of `N = n + m + 1` boundaries.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula for the number of logical qubits:\nk = 2 * (0) + (n + m + 1) - 1\nk = n + m\n\nTherefore, the number of logical qubits is the sum of the number of smooth and rough holes.\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is then calculated as:\nGSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)\n\nThis result holds regardless of whether the outer boundary is smooth or rough. For instance, if the outer boundary is smooth, we have `n+1` smooth boundaries and `m` rough ones. If the outer boundary is rough, we have `n` smooth boundaries and `m+1` rough ones. In both scenarios, the total number of boundaries is `n+m+1`, leading to `n+m` logical qubits. A simple planar code with no holes (`n=0, m=0`) has one outer boundary, resulting in `k=1-1=0` logical qubits and a degeneracy of 2^0 = 1, which is correct. A plane with a single hole of either type (`n=1, m=0` or `n=0, m=1`) has two boundaries in total, leading to `k=2-1=1` logical qubit and a degeneracy of 2, which is also consistent.\n\nThus, the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes is 2^(m+n).\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA. 2^(m+n)\nB. 2^(m+n-2)\nC. 2^(m+n+2)\nD. 2^(2m)\nE. 2^(2n)\nF. 2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)\n\nThe calculated degeneracy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
