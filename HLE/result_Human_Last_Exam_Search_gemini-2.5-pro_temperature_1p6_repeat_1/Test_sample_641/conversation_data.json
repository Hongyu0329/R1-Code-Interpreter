    "I am unable to provide the specific number of involutions in PSU(4,997) with the available tools.\n\nTo calculate the number of involutions, one must first determine the number of distinct conjugacy classes of involutions within the group PSU(4, 997) and the size of the centralizer for a representative element of each class. The number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these conjugacy classes.\n\nThe structure of the conjugacy classes of involutions in PSU(n, q) is known to depend on the values of n and q, specifically the congruence of q modulo 4 or 8. For PSU(4, q) with q odd, the number of conjugacy classes of involutions differs depending on the residue of q modulo 8. The available resources, such as the paper \"A Characterization of the Unitary Groups PSU(4, q^2), q odd\" by W. T. Fong, provide details for cases where q is congruent to 3 or 7 modulo 8, but not for the case q = 997, which is congruent to 5 modulo 8.\n\nA detailed analysis of the centralizer structures for each class of involutions for this specific case is required to calculate their sizes and, subsequently, the total number of involutions. This information is found in highly specialized literature on the structure of finite simple groups and is not readily available in the search results.\n\nTherefore, without the precise number of conjugacy classes for this specific case and the formulas for the orders of the corresponding centralizers, a final numerical answer cannot be computed.\n\n<<<Cannot be answered>>>"
