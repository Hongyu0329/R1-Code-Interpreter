    "The Wittig reaction is a powerful method in organic synthesis used to convert aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. The reaction involves a triphenyl phosphonium ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with a carbonyl compound. The core transformation is the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom with the carbon group from the ylide, forming a carbon-carbon double bond and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct. The location of the new double bond is precisely where the carbonyl group was, which is a significant advantage of this method.\n\nTo determine the product of the specified reaction, we must first identify the structures of the two reactants:\n\n1.  **Pivalaldehyde:** Also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, this is an aldehyde with a tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Its chemical structure is (CH₃)₃CCHO.\n2.  **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane:** This is the Wittig reagent (an ylide). The name indicates a triphenylphosphine group (PPh₃) double-bonded to an ethylidene group (=CHCH₃) which is substituted at its second carbon with a 2-chlorophenyl group. Its chemical structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\nThe reaction proceeds by the nucleophilic carbon of the ylide (the one double-bonded to phosphorus) attacking the electrophilic carbon of the pivalaldehyde's carbonyl group. This leads to a four-membered ring intermediate, an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to yield the final products. The driving force of the reaction is the formation of the very stable phosphorus-oxygen double bond in triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\nThe aldehyde's (CH₃)₃C-CH=O group and the ylide's =CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) group combine at the site of the original double bonds. The resulting alkene has the following structure: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\nThe IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThis reaction typically produces a mixture of (E) and (Z) stereoisomers. The specific isomer ratio depends on factors like the ylide's reactivity and the reaction conditions. Ylides that are not stabilized by electron-withdrawing groups, such as the one in this reaction, generally favor the formation of the (Z)-alkene.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
