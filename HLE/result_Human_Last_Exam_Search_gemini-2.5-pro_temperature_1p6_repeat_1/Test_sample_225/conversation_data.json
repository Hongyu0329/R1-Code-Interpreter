    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, can be determined using a known formula.\n\nThe curve is given by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nFor a Lissajous curve defined by `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula `(a-1)(b-1)/2`. In this specific case, a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nFirst, we check if 'a' and 'b' are coprime. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are coprime.\n\nNext, we apply the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
