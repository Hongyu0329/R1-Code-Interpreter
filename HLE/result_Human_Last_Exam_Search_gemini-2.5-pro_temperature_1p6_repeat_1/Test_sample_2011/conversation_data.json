    "My initial analysis seems correct. The search results confirm the standard definitions of clique, induced subgraph, and clique number.\n\nA key point is the distinction between a \"maximal clique\" and a \"maximum clique\". A maximal clique is one that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. A maximum clique is a clique of the largest possible size in the graph. The size of a maximum clique is the clique number, denoted ω(G). The question, however, is not about maximal cliques but about all possible clique sizes.\n\nThe phrasing \"clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs\" means we are looking for the number of distinct integers `k` for which the graph `G` contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to a complete graph `K_k`. An induced `K_k` is, by definition, a clique of size `k`.\n\nIf a graph `G` has a clique of a certain size `m`, then any subset of `k < m` vertices from that clique also forms a clique. This smaller clique is an induced subgraph as well. Consequently, if the largest clique in a graph `G` (the maximum clique) has size `ω(G)`, then there necessarily exist induced subgraphs of all clique sizes from 1 to `ω(G)`. Therefore, the set of all possible induced clique sizes is {1, 2, ..., `ω(G)`}. The number of different clique sizes is `ω(G)`.\n\nThe problem is thus equivalent to determining the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n = 128` vertices.\n\nThe size of a clique in a graph cannot exceed the total number of vertices in that graph. For a graph with 128 vertices, the clique number `ω(G)` can be at most 128.\n\nTo achieve this maximum, we can consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted `K_128`. In `K_128`, all 128 vertices are connected to each other, forming a clique of size 128. Thus, the clique number of `K_128` is 128.\n\nFor this graph `K_128`, we can find induced subgraphs of any clique size `k` from 1 to 128 by simply selecting any `k` vertices. This means that `K_128` has induced cliques of sizes {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}. The number of these distinct sizes is 128.\n\nSince the number of different clique sizes is bounded by the number of vertices, 128 is the maximum possible number.\n\nFinal answer seems to be 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
