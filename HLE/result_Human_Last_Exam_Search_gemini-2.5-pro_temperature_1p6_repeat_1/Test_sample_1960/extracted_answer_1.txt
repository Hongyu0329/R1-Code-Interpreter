**Final Answer**

Let the base formula `A` be defined as:
$$
A := \bot \multimap 1
$$
This formula is constructed using only the allowed constants and connectives and contains no literals.

The function `f: \mathbb{N} \to \text{Formula}` is defined as:
$$
f(w) = \underbrace{A \otimes A \otimes \dots \otimes A}_{w \text{ times}} \quad (\text{denoted } A^{\otimes w})
$$
For `w=0`, `f(0)` would be the multiplicative unit `1`.

The formula `C = C(W, m, b)` is defined as:
$$
C = \underbrace{B \otimes B \otimes \dots \otimes B}_{m \text{ times}} \quad \text{where} \quad B = \underbrace{A \otimes A \otimes \dots \otimes A}_{b \text{ times}}
$$
This can be written more compactly as:
$$
C = (A^{\otimes b})^{\otimes m}
$$

With these definitions, the sequent `\{ f(w) \mid w \in W \} \vdash C` is derivable in multiplicative linear logic if and only if the equipartitioning problem `EP(W, m, b)` is true.
