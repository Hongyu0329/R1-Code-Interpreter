When applying the local median operator to a binary image, the edges of the image evolve in a way that is a discrete approximation of mean curvature flow. This means that sharp corners are rounded, with convex corners being eroded and concave corners being filled in. Over many iterations ($t\rightarrow\infty$), this process continuously smooths and shortens the total length of the edges. Smaller shapes will shrink and eventually disappear. The ultimate state of the image will be one of minimal edge length, which is typically an image of a single, solid color or simple, stable shapes with minimal curvature like straight lines.
