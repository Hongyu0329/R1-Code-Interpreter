    "Based on a complete classification, there are a finite number of groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3. A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all `a, b` in `S`, their product `ab` is not in `S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n\nThe classification of these groups was completed by C. S. Anabanti and Sarah Hart, who proved that any such group must have an order of 24 or less. This confirmed a conjecture by M. Giudici and S. Hart and finalized the list of such groups that was partially compiled in earlier work.\n\nThe complete list of these groups is found in a table in the paper \"Groups Containing Small Locally Maximal Product-Free Sets\". Counting the distinct isomorphism classes of groups in this table reveals the total number.\n\nThe groups are distributed across various orders up to 24 and include cyclic groups, dihedral groups, symmetric and alternating groups, and other specific group structures. The full list includes:\n*   **Order 5:** C_5\n*   **Order 6:** C_6, S_3\n*   **Order 7:** C_7\n*   **Order 8:** C_8, D_8, Q_8\n*   **Order 9:** C_9\n*   **Order 10:** C_10, D_10\n*   **Order 12:** C_12, C_2 x C_6, A_4\n*   **Order 13:** C_13\n*   **Order 14:** C_14, D_14\n*   **Order 15:** C_15\n*   **Order 16:** C_16, C_2 x C_8, C_4 x C_4, D_16, Q_16, QD_16\n*   **Order 18:** C_18, D_18, S_3 x C_3\n*   **Order 20:** C_20, D_20\n*   **Order 21:** C_21\n*   **Order 22:** C_22, D_22\n*   **Order 24:** C_24, C_2 x C_12, D_24, S_4, SL(2,3), A_4 x C_2\n\nCounting these distinct groups gives a total of 38.\n\n<<<38>>>"
