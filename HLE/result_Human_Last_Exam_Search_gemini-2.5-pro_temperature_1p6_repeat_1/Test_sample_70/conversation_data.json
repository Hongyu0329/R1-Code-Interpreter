    "The flag of Denmark, when viewed as a matrix with different numerical values for each color to maximize its rank, has a rank of 2. This is because the Nordic cross design results in two unique types of row vectors: rows corresponding to the horizontal bar of the cross and rows not corresponding to it.\n\nTo find African national flags with the same linear algebraic rank, we must identify flags whose designs result in a matrix with exactly two linearly independent rows or columns. This generally includes flags with two different-colored horizontal stripes, two different-colored vertical stripes, or patterns like A-B-A where there are only two unique patterns of colors in either rows or columns. Flags with more colors in distinct stripes, or complex emblems that introduce new color patterns in multiple rows or columns, will have a higher rank.\n\nAfter analyzing the designs of the 54 national flags of Africa, two nations meet this criterion:\n\n*   **Nigeria:** The Nigerian flag is composed of three vertical stripes, with the outer stripes being green and the inner stripe being white. This green-white-green pattern results in two distinct types of column vectors, giving the flag's matrix a rank of 2.\n*   **Somalia:** The Somalian flag features a light blue field with a single white five-pointed star in the center. This design creates two unique types of row vectors: rows that are entirely blue, and rows that contain the white pixels of the star. Therefore, its matrix representation has a rank of 2.\n\nOther flags, such as those with three or more distinct horizontal or vertical stripes (e.g., Ghana, Senegal), or those with complex emblems, chevrons, or multiple colors (e.g., South Africa, Kenya, Mauritania), have a rank greater than 2.\n\n<<<Nigeria and Somalia>>>"
