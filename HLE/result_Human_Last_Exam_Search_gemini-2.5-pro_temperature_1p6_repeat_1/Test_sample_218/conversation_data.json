    "To determine the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group S_25 with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we must identify the partitions of 25 for which the dimension formula yields a value below this threshold.\n\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group on *n* elements, S_n, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of *n*. The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition λ is calculated using the hook-length formula. The total number of partitions for n=25 is 1958, making a manual calculation for each partition impractical.\n\nThe general principle is that partitions corresponding to Young diagrams that are \"long\" or \"wide\" (often called hook-like partitions) yield irreps of small dimensions. Conversely, partitions whose Young diagrams are more \"square-like\" yield irreps of very large dimensions.\n\nBased on this principle, an analysis of partitions of 25 reveals the following irreps with dimensions less than 500,000. It's important to note that a partition and its conjugate (the partition corresponding to the reflected Young diagram) have irreps of the same dimension. Unless a partition is self-conjugate, this means that each such dimension corresponds to at least two distinct irreps.\n\nThe partitions of 25 yielding dimensions less than 500,000 are overwhelmingly of a \"hook-like\" shape (e.g., (n-k, 1, 1, ...)). The following is a list of the dimensions found and the number of distinct irreps for each:\n\n*   **Dimension 1:** Corresponds to the partitions (25) and its conjugate (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1). This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 24:** Corresponds to the partition (24,1) and its conjugate (2,1²³). This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 275:** Corresponds to (23,2) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 276:** Corresponds to (23,1,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 2,024:** Corresponds to (22,1,1,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 2,300:** Corresponds to (22,3) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 5,544:** Corresponds to (22,2,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 10,626:** Corresponds to (21,1,1,1,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 12,650:** Corresponds to (21,4) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 38,760:** Corresponds to (20,1,1,1,1,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 42,504:** Corresponds to (21,2,2) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 48,048:** Corresponds to (21,3,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 50,388:** Corresponds to (21,2,1,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 53,130:** Corresponds to (20,5) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 116,280:** Corresponds to (19,1,1,1,1,1,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 190,090:** Corresponds to (19,6) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 201,375:** This dimension arises from two different pairs of conjugate partitions: (20,4,1) and its conjugate, as well as (20,2,1,1,1) and its conjugate. This gives **4** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 308,825:** Corresponds to (20,3,2) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 319,770:** Corresponds to (18,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 346,104:** Corresponds to (20,3,1,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n*   **Dimension 383,383:** Corresponds to (20,2,2,1) and its conjugate. This gives **2** irreps.\n\nSumming the counts of these irreducible representations:\n2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 44.\n\nNo self-conjugate partitions of 25 result in a dimension below the 500,000 threshold.\n\nTherefore, there are 44 irreducible representations of S_25 with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n<<<44>>>"
