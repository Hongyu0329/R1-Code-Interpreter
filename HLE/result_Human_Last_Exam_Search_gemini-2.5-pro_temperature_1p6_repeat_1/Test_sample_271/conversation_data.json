    "To determine the possible degrees of the normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we must first find the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be this Galois group.\n\nThe Galois group of this specific polynomial is the symmetric group $S_7$. The degree of the splitting field extension is the order of this group, $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_7| = 7! = 5040$.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ (with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$) and subgroups of the Galois group $G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension if and only if the corresponding subgroup, $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ implies that the corresponding subgroup $H$ must be a proper, non-trivial subgroup of $G$. Thus, we are looking for the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=S_7$.\n\nFor any integer $n \\ge 5$, the symmetric group $S_n$ has only one proper, non-trivial normal subgroup: the alternating group $A_n$. In our case, with $n=7$, the only proper, non-trivial normal subgroup of $S_7$ is $A_7$.\n\nThe degree of the corresponding normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the index of this subgroup in $G$:\n$[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G:H| = |S_7 : A_7| = \\frac{|S_7|}{|A_7|} = \\frac{7!}{7!/2} = 2$.\n\nTherefore, there is only one such intermediate normal field extension $L$, and its degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is 2. The list of all possible degrees contains only one value.\n\n<<<2>>>"
