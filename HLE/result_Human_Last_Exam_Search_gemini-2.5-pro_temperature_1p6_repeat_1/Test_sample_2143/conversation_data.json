    "In his final work, *Moses and Monotheism*, Sigmund Freud offered a controversial interpretation of the biblical narrative. According to Freud's psychoanalytic perspective, he delved into the origins of monotheism and the psychological underpinnings of the Ten Commandments. His analysis of Moses and the development of Jewish law provides a framework where one could connect the prohibition against making images of God (a move towards abstraction and intellectuality) with the commandments regarding desire and material possessions.\n\n<<<Sigmund Freud>>>"
