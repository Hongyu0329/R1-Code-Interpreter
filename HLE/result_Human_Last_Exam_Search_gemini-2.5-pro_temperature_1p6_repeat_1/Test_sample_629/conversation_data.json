    "Based on the research, the following facts have been established:\n\n*   **Minimal Grid Number:** The minimal grid number, also known as the arc index, for a trefoil knot is 5. This is confirmed by the formula for alternating knots, where the arc index is the crossing number plus two (3 + 2 = 5). It is also stated that the first non-trivial knots appear at grid number 5.\n*   **Total Number of Diagrams:** At the minimal grid number of 5, there are a total of 10 grid diagrams that represent the trefoil knot, combining both the left-handed and right-handed versions.\n*   **Diagrams per Chirality:** The set of minimal grid diagrams for a knot and its mirror image have the same size. Research papers show a figure with all 5 minimal grid diagrams for the *right-handed* trefoil knot. This implies that the other 5 diagrams from the total of 10 belong to the left-handed trefoil.\n*   **Distinctness:** The five diagrams presented for the right-handed trefoil are shown as a complete set of distinct diagrams under the equivalence of rotation and translation. By symmetry, the same holds for the five diagrams of the left-handed trefoil.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand trefoil knot has 5 minimal grid diagrams, counted up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
