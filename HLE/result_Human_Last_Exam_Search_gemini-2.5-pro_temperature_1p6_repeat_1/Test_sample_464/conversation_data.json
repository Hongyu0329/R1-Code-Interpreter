    "Yes, if a Schwartz class function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the condition that all its moments are zero, it necessarily follows that the function is identically zero.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n### The Proof via Fourier Transform\n\nThe proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform on the space of Schwartz functions. Let's define the Fourier transform of $f(x)$ as:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx\n$$\n\n1.  **Taylor Expansion of the Exponential:** We can express the complex exponential $e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}$ using its Taylor series expansion:\n    $$\n    e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-2\\pi i x \\xi)^k}{k!}\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the definition of the Fourier transform gives:\n    $$\n    \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-2\\pi i \\xi)^k}{k!} x^k \\right) \\,dx\n    $$\n\n2.  **Interchanging Summation and Integration:** For a fixed $\\xi$, we can switch the order of integration and summation. This is justified by the dominated convergence theorem, because $f$ is a Schwartz function. The rapid decay of $f(x)$ ensures that $\\int |f(x) x^k| dx$ is finite for all $k$, and the Taylor series converges absolutely and uniformly for $x$ in any bounded interval. This allows us to write:\n    $$\n    \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-2\\pi i \\xi)^k}{k!} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx\n    $$\n\n3.  **Using the Moment Condition:** The problem states that all the moments of $f$ are zero. Assuming $\\mathbb{N}$ includes 0, this means:\n    $$\n    \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\n    $$\n    Substituting this into our expression for $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, we find that every term in the series is zero.\n\n4.  **The Fourier Transform is Zero:** This directly implies that the Fourier transform of $f$ is identically zero for all $\\xi$:\n    $$\n    \\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0\n    $$\n\n5.  **Injectivity of the Fourier Transform:** A crucial property of the Fourier transform is that it is an automorphism (a self-isomorphism) on the Schwartz space. This means it is a one-to-one and onto mapping. Because it is one-to-one (injective), if the Fourier transforms of two functions are equal, the functions themselves must be equal. This property is guaranteed by the Fourier Inversion Theorem.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ and the Fourier transform of the zero function is also zero, the injectivity of the transform implies that $f$ must be the zero function, i.e., $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Remarks on the Moment Problem\n\nThis result is a specific case of what is known as the \"moment problem,\" which asks whether a function is uniquely determined by its sequence of moments. For functions on an unbounded interval like the real line (the Hamburger moment problem), uniqueness is not guaranteed in general. There exist non-zero functions in other classes (e.g., some that do not decay rapidly enough) for which all moments are zero. However, the strong decay conditions imposed on Schwartz functions are sufficient to ensure that only the zero function can have all its moments equal to zero.\n\n<<<Yes, it follows that f=0.>>>"
