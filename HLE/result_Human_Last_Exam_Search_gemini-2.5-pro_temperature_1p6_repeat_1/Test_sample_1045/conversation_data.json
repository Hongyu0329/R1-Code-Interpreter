    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are utilized. This is determined by calculating the number of functions for each atom and summing them.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**For each Carbon (C) atom:**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence type. For a heavy atom like carbon, this means:\n*   The core (1s) orbital is represented by **one** contracted function (composed of 6 primitive Gaussians).\n*   The valence (2s and 2p) orbitals are split into two parts. This results in two s-functions and two sets of p-functions (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n*   This leads to a total of 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for the inner 2s, 2p) + 4 (for the outer 2s, 2p) = **9** contracted basis functions for each carbon atom.\n\n**For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   Hydrogen has only a valence 1s orbital, which is split into two parts in the 6-31G basis set.\n*   This results in **2** contracted basis functions for each hydrogen atom.\n\n**Total Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):**\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 contracted Gaussian functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
