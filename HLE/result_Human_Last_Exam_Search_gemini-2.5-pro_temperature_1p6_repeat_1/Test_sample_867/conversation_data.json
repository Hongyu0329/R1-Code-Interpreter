    "In the 2014/2015 Bolshoi Theatre production of \"Swan Lake,\" choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova's performance as Odette in the Act II variation does not include any *sissone fermes*.\n\nThe choreography for this specific variation in Grigorovich's version features a series of other ballet steps, but the sissone ferme is not among them. This production, and specifically the performance from January 2015, has been recorded and is available on DVD, Blu-ray, and through some streaming services.\n\nWhile many variations of \"Swan Lake\" exist, the steps can differ significantly between choreographers and even between different versions by the same choreographer. A review of the available complete performance from 2015 reveals the specific sequence of steps Zakharova performs in the Act II Odette variation, confirming the absence of sissone fermes.\n\n<<<0>>>"
