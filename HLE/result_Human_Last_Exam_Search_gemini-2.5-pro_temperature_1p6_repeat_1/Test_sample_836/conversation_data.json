    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, commonly denoted as G(r,t), is known in the nuclear and condensed matter physics communities as the **dynamic structure factor**, S(k,ω).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin (r=0) at time t=0. The double Fourier transform translates this function from real space and time (r, t) to reciprocal space (or momentum transfer, **k**) and frequency (or energy transfer, ω).\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality and reactor noise analysis, the underlying principle of methods like Feynman-alpha and Rossi-alpha is the time correlation of neutron detection events. These correlations are a direct result of the underlying pair correlations of neutrons within the fissile system. The analysis of reactor noise often involves measuring the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** of the neutron fluctuations. The PSD is the temporal Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the neutron noise and is directly related to the dynamic structure factor. Therefore, while the fundamental physical quantity is the dynamic structure factor, in the practical application of nuclear reactor noise analysis, the term **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** is more commonly used.\n\n<<<The dynamic structure factor, S(k,ω)>>>"
