    "The volume of the intersection of two cubes, each with a side length of 1, that are shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to each other is approximately 0.354.\n\nTo determine this volume, we first define the geometry of the problem. A unit cube can be considered to occupy the space where the coordinates (x, y, z) satisfy 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1. The main diagonal of this cube connects opposite vertices, for instance, the origin (0, 0, 0) and the point (1, 1, 1). The direction of this diagonal can be represented by the vector **d** = (1, 1, 1), which has a length of ||**d**|| = √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3.\n\nThe problem states a shift of 1/2 \"along the main diagonal\". This implies that the translation vector has a magnitude of 1/2 and is in the direction of the main diagonal. The unit vector in this direction is **u** = **d** / ||**d**|| = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3). Therefore, the shift vector **v** is (1/2) * **u** = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\n\nThe second cube is a translation of the first cube by this vector **v**. Consequently, the second cube is defined by the inequalities:\n*   1/(2√3) ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n*   1/(2√3) ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n*   1/(2√3) ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes forms a smaller cube. The dimensions of this intersection are determined by finding the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n*   For the x-coordinate, the overlapping interval is [max(0, 1/(2√3)), min(1, 1 + 1/(2√3))], which simplifies to [1/(2√3), 1]. The length of this side is 1 - 1/(2√3).\n*   Similarly, the side lengths for the y and z coordinates are also 1 - 1/(2√3).\n\nThe volume of the intersection is the cube of this side length:\nVolume = (1 - 1/(2√3))³\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n1/(2√3) ≈ 1/(2 * 1.732) ≈ 1/3.464 ≈ 0.2887\nSide length ≈ 1 - 0.2887 = 0.7113\nVolume ≈ (0.7113)³ ≈ 0.3599\n\nA more precise calculation gives the volume as (1 - 1/(2√3))³ ≈ (1 - 0.288675)³ = (0.711325)³ ≈ 0.35986.\n\n<<<0.35986>>>"
