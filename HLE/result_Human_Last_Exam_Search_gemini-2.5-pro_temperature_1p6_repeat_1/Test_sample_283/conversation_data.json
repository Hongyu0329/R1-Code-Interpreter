    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix, the matrix is recursively partitioned into a block structure that can be visualized as a binary tree. The \"depth\" of the tree refers to the number of levels of this recursive partitioning. For a tree of depth 4, we need to determine the number of submatrices that are stored and accessed during a standard matrix operation. The most fundamental of these operations, and the one whose complexity typically defines the performance of HSS methods, is the matrix-vector multiplication. This operation involves accessing all the constituent submatrices that define the HSS representation.\n\nAn HSS matrix is defined by a collection of smaller matrices, often called generators. The structure of these generators is tied to the nodes of the corresponding HSS tree. For a depth of 4, the tree has the following properties:\n*   **Levels:** A tree of depth 4 has 5 levels of nodes (level 0 for the root, up to level 4 for the leaves).\n*   **Leaf Nodes:** The number of leaf nodes at level 4 is 2^4 = 16. Each leaf node corresponds to a dense diagonal submatrix, denoted as a `D` block.\n*   **Internal Nodes:** The nodes that are not leaves are the internal nodes. The number of internal nodes for a complete binary tree of depth 4 is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15. Each internal node is associated with transfer or translation matrices (here referred to as `B` blocks) that relate the basis vectors of its children nodes.\n*   **Total Nodes:** The total number of nodes in the tree is the sum of internal and leaf nodes, which is 15 + 16 = 31. In a standard HSS representation, each node has basis matrices associated with it, denoted as `U` and `V` generators.\n\nThe matrix-vector multiplication algorithm involves a pass up the tree using the `V` generators, and a pass down the tree using the `U` and `B` generators, concluding with a multiplication by the `D` blocks at the leaves. This means all stored generator matrices are accessed.\n\nBased on this structure, the number of submatrices accessed is the sum of all the stored generator blocks:\n*   **`D` blocks (at the 16 leaf nodes):** 16 matrices.\n*   **`B` blocks (at the 15 internal nodes):** 15 matrices.\n*   **`U` blocks (one for each of the 31 nodes):** 31 matrices.\n*   **`V` blocks (one for each of the 31 nodes):** 31 matrices.\n\nThe total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of these components:\n\nTotal Submatrices = 16 (D) + 15 (B) + 31 (U) + 31 (V) = 93.\n\n<<<93>>>"
