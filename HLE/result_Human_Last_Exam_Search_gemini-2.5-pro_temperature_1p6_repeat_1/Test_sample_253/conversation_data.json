    "To determine the binary pattern after applying Rule 110 twenty times starting from a single cell in state 1, a step-by-step simulation is performed. Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell (0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors.\n\nThe rule is defined by the following lookup table, where the new state of the central cell is determined by the 3-cell neighborhood pattern:\n\n| Current Pattern | 111 | 110 | 101 | 100 | 011 | 010 | 001 | 000 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **New State** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n\nThis can be summarized by the binary sequence 01101110, which is 110 in decimal, hence the name Rule 110. The evolution starts with a single '1' on a background of '0's. Each subsequent line represents a time step.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern is as follows:\n\n*   **t=0:** `1`\n*   **t=1:** `110`\n*   **t=2:** `1110`\n*   **t=3:** `11010`\n*   **t=4:** `111110`\n*   **t=5:** `1100010`\n*   **t=6:** `11100110`\n*   **t=7:** `110101110`\n*   **t=8:** `1111110010`\n*   **t=9:** `11000010110`\n*   **t=10:** `111000111010`\n*   **t=11:** `1101001000110`\n*   **t=12:** `11111011001010`\n*   **t=13:** `110001101011110`\n*   **t=14:** `111001011100010`\n*   **t=15:** `1101011100100110`\n*   **t=16:** `11111100101101010`\n*   **t=17:** `110000101110111110`\n*   **t=18:** `111000111001000010`\n*   **t=19:** `1101001001011000110`\n*   **t=20:** `11111011011101001010`\n\nThus, after 20 applications of Rule 110, the resulting binary pattern is `11111011011101001010`.\n\n<<<11111011011101001010>>>"
