    "To determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we first analyze the equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, of the form u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x, y) u(y) dy, with f(x) = 1.\n\nThe kernel of the integral equation is K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y).\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, the kernel can be expanded as a sum of products of functions of x and y:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k.\nThis shows that K(x, y) is a degenerate (or separable) kernel.\n\nLet's define a set of coefficients c_k as:\nc_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy, for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nSubstituting this into the integral equation, the solution u(x) must have the form:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k).\nThis shows that u(x) is a polynomial in x of degree at most n-1.\n\nTo find the coefficients c_j, we substitute this form of u(x) back into their definition:\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)) dy\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^j y^(n-1-k) dy\nc_j = [y^(j+1)/(j+1)]₀¹ + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k [y^(n+j-k)/(n+j-k)]₀¹\nc_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (n+j-k).\n\nThis gives a system of n linear equations for the n unknown coefficients c₀, c₁, ..., c_(n-1). We can write this in matrix form. Let C be the column vector [c₀, ..., c_(n-1)]ᵀ, B be the column vector [1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ, and A be the n x n matrix with entries A_jk = 1/(n+j-k).\n\nThe system is C = B + λAC, which can be rearranged as:\n(I - λA)C = B.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, this system has a unique solution for C (and thus the integral equation has a unique solution for u(x)) if the determinant of the matrix (I - λA) is non-zero. If det(I - λA) = 0, the equation may have no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe values of λ for which det(I - λA) = 0 are the characteristic values of the integral operator. These are the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix A. Let μ = 1/λ be an eigenvalue of A, corresponding to the homogeneous equation v(x) = λ ∫ K(x, y) v(y) dy.\n\nWhen λ is a characteristic value, a solution to the non-homogeneous equation exists if and only if the forcing term f(x) is orthogonal to all solutions of the adjoint homogeneous equation w(x) = λ ∫ K(y, x) w(y) dy.\nThe condition is ∫₀¹ f(x)w(x) dx = 0.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 1. The kernel K(x, y) = ∑ x^(n-1-k)y^k is symmetric, since K(y, x) = ∑ y^(n-1-k)x^k = ∑ x^k y^(n-1-k), which is the same sum with a different index order. Therefore, the operator is self-adjoint, and the eigenfunctions v(x) and w(x) are the same.\nThe condition for the existence of a solution for a characteristic value λ becomes:\n∫₀¹ 1 * v(x) dx = 0, where v(x) is a non-trivial eigenfunction.\n\nThe eigenfunctions are of the form v(x) = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) d_k x^(n-1-k), where d_k = ∫ y^k v(y) dy are the components of an eigenvector of the matrix A for the eigenvalue μ=1/λ. The condition becomes:\n∫₀¹ (λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) d_k x^(n-1-k)) dx = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) d_k ∫₀¹ x^(n-1-k) dx = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) d_k / (n-k) = 0.\n\nFrom the eigenvector equation d_j = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) A_jk d_k, let's look at the first row (j=0):\nd₀ = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) A_0k d_k = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) d_k / (n-k).\nComparing this with the condition for existence of a solution, we see that the integral is simply d₀.\nSo, for a characteristic value λ, a solution exists if and only if d₀ = 0 for the corresponding eigenvector D = [d₀, ..., d_(n-1)]ᵀ.\n\nIf d₀ ≠ 0 for an eigenvector D, the equation has no solution for the corresponding characteristic value λ. It can be shown that for the matrix A_jk = 1/(n+j-k), all eigenvectors have a non-zero first component d₀.\nTherefore, for every characteristic value λ, the condition ∫v(x)dx=d₀≠0 holds, meaning the equation has no solution.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the characteristic values λ, which are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A.\nA_jk = 1/(n+j-k) for j, k = 0, ..., n-1.\n\nFor n=1: A =. The only eigenvalue is μ=1. So λ=1/μ=1.\nFor n=2: A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]. The characteristic equation is det(A-μI) = (1/2-μ)² - 1/3 = μ²-μ-1/12=0. The eigenvalues are μ = (3 ± 2√3)/6. The corresponding values for λ are λ = 1/μ = 6/(3 ± 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3.\n\nFor a general integer n, there is no simple closed-form expression for the eigenvalues of this matrix. The problem asks for the specific values of λ, but these values depend on n and are the roots of a polynomial of degree n.\n\nTherefore, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A, where A_jk = 1/(n+j-k) for j,k=0,...,n-1.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix A whose elements are given by A_jk = 1/(n+j-k), for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
