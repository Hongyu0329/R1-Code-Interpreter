    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, have a diet that primarily consists of soft-bodied arthropods. Numerous sources confirm that they are predators, with a particular preference for aphids. In agricultural settings like pear orchards, they are considered important predators of pests such as the pear psylla.\n\nIn addition to their predatory behavior, some adult snakeflies also feed on nectar and pollen. They can be found on nectar-producing, small-flowered plants. However, it is currently unclear to scientists whether pollen is an essential part of their diet or simply a favored food source. There is no scientific record of them feeding on fungus or leaf tissue.\n\nBased on the evidence:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Correct. Some adults feed on nectar.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Correct. While the specific \"Totara\" aphid might not be documented, adult snakeflies are well-known predators of aphids in general.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the one that includes both nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
