    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a minimum of 13 essential control samples to ensure accurate data and proper gating for sorting. These controls are crucial for managing autofluorescence, spectral overlap, and non-specific binding, which are critical considerations in multi-color flow cytometry.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n**1. Unstained Control (1 sample):**\n*   **Purpose:** This sample contains only your cells and streptavidin beads without any fluorescent dyes. It is fundamental for determining the baseline level of autofluorescence in your cell population and from the beads themselves. This control helps in setting the initial voltage for your detectors.\n\n**2. Viability Control (1 sample):**\n*   **Purpose:** To differentiate between live and dead cells. Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and fluorescent dyes, leading to false-positive results. Using a viability dye (e.g., 7-AAD, Propidium Iodide, or a fixable viability dye) is crucial for sorting experiments to ensure you are collecting viable cells. This control sample contains cells stained only with the viability dye.\n\n**3. Single-Color Compensation Controls (5 samples):**\n*   **Purpose:** These are essential for correcting spectral overlap, which is the spillover of a fluorescent signal from one channel into another. You will need one single-stained sample for each fluorophore in your panel: AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **Preparation:** Each control should be stained with only one fluorescent label. It's critical that the positive population in your compensation control is at least as bright as your experimental sample. These can be prepared using either your cells or compensation beads. For the channel involving the streptavidin conjugate, the control should ideally use the same streptavidin-fluorophore combination.\n\n**4. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):**\n*   **Purpose:** FMO controls are used to accurately set the gates for identifying positive cell populations, especially when the signal is dim or there is significant spillover from other channels. These controls account for the spread of fluorescence from all other fluorophores into the channel of interest.\n*   **Preparation:** An FMO control is created for each fluorophore in your panel. Each FMO sample is stained with all the antibodies in your panel *except* for one. For a five-color experiment, you will have five different FMO tubes.\n\n**5. Streptavidin Non-Specific Binding Control (1 sample):**\n*   **Purpose:** Since you are using streptavidin beads, it is important to have a control that assesses any non-specific binding of the streptavidin-fluorophore conjugate.\n*   **Preparation:** This sample would include your cells and the fluorescently labeled streptavidin, but without the biotinylated antibody. This helps ensure that the signal you are detecting is due to the specific binding of the biotinylated antibody to its target, and not due to the streptavidin conjugate binding non-specifically to the cells or beads.\n\nIn summary, the total number of essential control tubes is the sum of these individual controls: 1 (unstained) + 1 (viability) + 5 (compensation) + 5 (FMO) + 1 (streptavidin non-specific) = 13 controls. While this may seem like a large number, they are all critical for obtaining reliable and reproducible results in a multi-color cell sorting experiment. For well-established protocols, some FMO controls for brightly expressed and well-separated markers might be omitted, but they are highly recommended when establishing a new panel.\n\n<<<13>>>"
