    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière (backward bend) in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. The Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on maintaining squared hips throughout the movement, while the Balanchine technique often permits the hip of the working leg to lift.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a fundamental principle is the stability and alignment of the torso, which requires the hips to remain square to the direction the dancer is facing. This ensures that the bend originates from the upper and middle back, promoting spinal flexibility and strength while maintaining a classical, unbroken line.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine style is characterized by its speed, dynamism, and the creation of long, extended lines. To achieve this aesthetic, the hip of the working leg is frequently allowed to open and lift, particularly in movements like an arabesque, which is often combined with a cambré derrière. This opening of the hip creates the illusion of a higher and more dramatic leg line. This stylistic choice is a significant departure from the Vaganova technique's insistence on a squared torso. While other elements such as arm and head placement, speed, and the degree of the backbend can differ stylistically between the two methods, the approach to hip placement is a foundational technical divergence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
