The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial due to the Parker Spiral. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z) for calculating normalized magnetic helicity is a standard and justified practice based on the use of common, fixed coordinate systems (like GSE) for solar wind data analysis.
