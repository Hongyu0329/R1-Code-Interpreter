    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The fixed points of this function are the real solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n1.  **Determine the degree of the composite function.**\n    Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. We can write them as:\n    $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$\n    $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$\n    where $a_3 \\neq 0$ and $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\n    The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n    Degree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the equation for fixed points.**\n    The fixed points are the roots of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n    Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The number of fixed points is the number of real roots of the polynomial $P(x)$.\n    The degree of $f(g(x))$ is 9. The term $-x$ does not change the degree. So, $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n    According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is at most 9.\n\n3.  **Analyze the constraints on the derivatives.**\n    We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    The derivative of a cubic polynomial is a quadratic polynomial.\n    $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1 > 0$\n    $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1 > 0$\n    For a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, we must have $A>0$ and the discriminant $B^2-4AC < 0$.\n    This implies:\n    *   For $f'(x)$: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$ and $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 < 12a_1a_3 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n    *   For $g'(x)$: $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$ and $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 < 12b_1b_3 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n    These conditions ensure that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\n4.  **Analyze the derivative of the composite function.**\n    The derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is given by the chain rule:\n    $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any value $y$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, their product $h'(x)$ is also always positive. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n5.  **Investigate the number of roots of $P(x) = h(x) - x$.**\n    While $h(x)$ is strictly increasing, this does not mean it can only intersect the line $y=x$ once. The graph of $h(x)$ can \"wiggle\" and cross the line $y=x$ multiple times. For $P(x)=0$ to have 9 distinct real roots, say $x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_9$, by Rolle's Theorem, the derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots, one in each interval $(x_i, x_{i+1})$.\n\n    The derivative is $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$. So we need the equation $h'(x) - 1 = 0$, or $h'(x)=1$, to have at least 8 real roots.\n\n    Let's analyze the degree of $h'(x)$:\n    $h'(x) = (3a_3(g(x))^2 + 2a_2g(x) + a_1)(3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1)$.\n    The degree of the first factor, $f'(g(x))$, is $2 \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    The degree of the second factor, $g'(x)$, is 2.\n    The degree of their product, $h'(x)$, is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\n    So, the equation $h'(x) = 1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have up to 8 real roots. Thus, it is theoretically possible for $P'(x)$ to have 8 real roots. If $P'(x)$ has 8 roots, then $P(x)$ can have up to $8+1=9$ roots.\n\n6.  **Possibility of attaining the maximum.**\n    To have 8 roots for $h'(x) = 1$, the graph of the 8th-degree polynomial $h'(x)$ must oscillate sufficiently.\n    *   As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, $g(x) \\to \\pm\\infty$ (since $b_3>0$).\n    *   As $y \\to \\pm\\infty$, $f'(y) \\to +\\infty$ (since $a_3>0$).\n    *   As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, $g'(x) \\to +\\infty$.\n    *   Therefore, $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n    The derivative $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8 with a positive leading coefficient, so it has a global minimum. We need to be able to make this minimum, and other local minima, less than 1, while local maxima are greater than 1.\n    The existence of such polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and allow for 9 fixed points has been demonstrated in mathematical literature. It requires careful selection of coefficients to create the necessary oscillations in $h'(x)$ relative to the line $y=1$. There is no inherent property in the conditions that would prevent this from happening.\n\nSince a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots, and no constraint prevents this number from being achieved, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
