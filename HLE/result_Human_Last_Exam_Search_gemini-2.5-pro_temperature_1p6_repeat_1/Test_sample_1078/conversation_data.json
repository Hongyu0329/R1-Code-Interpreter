    "There are 12 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. These are categorized into irreducible and reducible groups.\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups\nA finite Weyl group is irreducible if its corresponding Dynkin diagram is connected. For a rank of 4, this means the diagram has 4 nodes. The non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4 are:\n*   **W(A₄)**: The Weyl group corresponding to the type A₄ root system, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₅. Its order is 120.\n*   **W(B₄)**: The Weyl group for the type B₄ root system. This group is isomorphic to the Weyl group W(C₄). Its order is 384.\n*   **W(D₄)**: The Weyl group for the type D₄ root system. Its order is 192.\n*   **W(F₄)**: The exceptional Weyl group of type F₄. Its order is 1152.\n\nThese four groups are non-isomorphic as they all have different orders.\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups\nA reducible Weyl group is the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to the total rank. For a rank of 4, we consider the partitions of the number 4:\n\n**Partition 3+1:**\n*   W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n*   W(B₃) × W(A₁) (isomorphic to W(C₃) × W(A₁))\n\n**Partition 2+2:**\n*   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n*   W(B₂) × W(B₂) (isomorphic to W(C₂) × W(C₂))\n*   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n\n**Partition 2+1+1:**\n*   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n*   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n\n**Partition 1+1+1+1:**\n*   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n\nBy checking for isomorphisms among these 8 reducible groups (primarily by comparing their orders), we find they are all distinct. For instance, W(A₃) × W(A₁) and W(A₂) × W(B₂) both have an order of 48, but they can be shown to be non-isomorphic by comparing the number of their conjugacy classes.\n\nIn total, there are 4 irreducible and 8 reducible, making a total of 12 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<12>>>"
