    "The letter that should appear next in the sequence is **M**.\n\nThis sequence appears to be based on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard, with some typographical errors. The standard bottom row of letters on a QWERTY keyboard is Z, X, C, V, B, N, M.\n\nIf you disregard the extra \"X\" and the out-of-place \"Y\" in the sequence you provided, the underlying pattern is the bottom row of the keyboard. Following this pattern, the letter that comes after \"N\" is \"M\". Many letter-based puzzles utilize the keyboard layout for their solution.\n\n<<<M>>>"
