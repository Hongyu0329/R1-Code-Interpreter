    "Once a single-dose ampule is punctured or opened in a sterile environment, it cannot be stored and must be used immediately. Any unused portion of the medication must be discarded and should not be kept for later use.\n\nThis guideline is in place because ampules are glass containers that cannot be resealed after being opened, which poses a risk of contamination.\n\nWhile single-dose *vials* that have been punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, this rule does not apply to ampules. The guidance for ampules is that they are for immediate, one-time use.\n\n<<<A single-dose ampule, once opened in a sterile environment, has a beyond-use date (BUD) of immediate use, and any remaining contents must be discarded immediately.>>>"
