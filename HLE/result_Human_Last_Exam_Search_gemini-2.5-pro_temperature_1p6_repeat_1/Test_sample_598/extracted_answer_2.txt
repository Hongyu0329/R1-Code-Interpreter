Yes, such a combination of parameters and pair of graphs exists. An example is the class $\mathsf{srg}(16,6,2,2)$, which contains the Shrikhande graph and the 4x4 Rook's graph. While both graphs adhere to these parameters, the Shrikhande graph has 256 5-cycles, whereas the 4x4 Rook's graph has 240 5-cycles.
