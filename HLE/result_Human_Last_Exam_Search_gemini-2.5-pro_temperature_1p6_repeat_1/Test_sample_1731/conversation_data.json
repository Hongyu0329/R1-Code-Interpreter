    "The user is asking a highly technical question that bridges large deviation theory in mathematics with statistical mechanics. I need to break this down into several steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to find the \"equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta\" using two specific mathematical tools: the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem and the Cramer-Chernoff theorem.\n\n2.  **Initial Knowledge & Keyword Identification:**\n    *   **Bose case of light quanta:** This refers to photons, which are bosons. Their statistical behavior is described by Bose-Einstein statistics. Key concepts here are:\n        *   Photons are indistinguishable.\n        *   Any number of photons can occupy the same energy state.\n        *   The number of photons is not conserved.\n        *   This leads to the Planck distribution for black-body radiation.\n        *   Relevant physical quantities: Entropy and Mean Energy.\n    *   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem (or just Sanov's Theorem):** This is a result from large deviation theory. It deals with the probability that the *empirical distribution* of a sequence of random samples deviates from the true underlying distribution. The rate function for this deviation is given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or relative entropy. This connects probability theory to the concept of entropy. Boltzmann's original 1877 work is seen as the genesis of this idea, linking statistical mechanics and large deviations.\n    *   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem (or Cramer's Theorem):** This is another fundamental theorem in large deviation theory. It deals with the probability that the *empirical mean* (average) of a sequence of random variables deviates from the true mean. The rate function is given by the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant-generating function.\n    *   **Equilibrium Values:** In statistical mechanics, equilibrium is the state of maximum entropy, subject to constraints like a fixed average energy. The system will most likely be observed in this state.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Concepts:**\n    *   The core idea of large deviation theory is to quantify the probability of rare events. In the context of statistical mechanics, a macroscopic state (e.g., a specific energy distribution) that is *not* the equilibrium state is a \"rare event\" when the number of particles (N) is very large.\n    *   The most probable state, the one with the lowest \"rate function\" (i.e., the one that is least \"rare\"), corresponds to the equilibrium state.\n    *   Sanov's theorem is about empirical distributions. We can think of the distribution of N particles over various energy levels as an empirical distribution. The theorem states that the probability of observing a particular distribution `q` (when the true underlying, unconstrained distribution is `p`) is `P(L_N ≈ q) ≈ exp(-N * D_KL(q || p))`.\n    *   The equilibrium state will be the distribution `q` that *minimizes* the rate function `D_KL(q || p)` subject to the physical constraints of the system.\n    *   For the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas in a cavity), the main constraint is a fixed average energy, `<E>`. The number of photons, N, is not conserved. The chemical potential for a photon gas is zero.\n\n4.  **Formulating the Derivation (Mental Walkthrough):**\n\n    *   **Setup:** Consider a system of photons (bosons) that can occupy discrete energy levels ε₁, ε₂, ε₃, ...\n    *   **Sanov's Theorem Application:** Let `q_i` be the probability that a randomly chosen photon is in the energy state `ε_i`. This `q = (q_1, q_2, ...)` is the empirical distribution of energy levels. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem tells us that the probability of observing a particular macroscopic state characterized by the distribution `q` is related to the relative entropy (KL-divergence) `H(q|p)`.\n    *   The rate function is the KL-divergence, `I(q) = D_KL(q || p) = Σ_i q_i log(q_i / p_i)`, where `p` is some reference measure. In the absence of constraints, we'd expect an equiprobable distribution over states, but here the states have different energies.\n    *   The entropy of the system (in the information-theoretic sense, up to a constant) is related to `-Σ_i q_i log(q_i)`. This is the Gibbs entropy. Boltzmann's principle states that the thermodynamic entropy `S` is `k_B * log(W)`, where `W` is the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate. For large N, `log(W)` is directly related to the Gibbs entropy. So, maximizing the number of microstates is equivalent to maximizing the Gibbs entropy.\n    *   **Constraints:**\n        1.  Normalization: `Σ_i q_i = 1`. (This is the distribution of a single particle).\n        2.  Mean Energy: `Σ_i q_i ε_i = <E>`. This is the crucial physical constraint.\n    *   **Finding Equilibrium:** We need to find the distribution `q*` that maximizes the entropy `S = -k_B Σ_i q_i log(q_i)` subject to the two constraints above. This is a standard optimization problem solved using Lagrange multipliers.\n        *   Lagrangian: `L = -Σ_i q_i log(q_i) - λ(Σ_i q_i - 1) - β(Σ_i q_i ε_i - <E>)`. (I'm dropping the `k_B` for now for simplicity, it's just a scaling constant).\n        *   Take the derivative with respect to `q_j` and set to zero: `∂L/∂q_j = -log(q_j) - 1 - λ - βε_j = 0`.\n        *   Solve for `q_j`: `log(q_j) = -1 - λ - βε_j` => `q_j = exp(-1 - λ) * exp(-βε_j)`.\n        *   The term `exp(-1 - λ)` is a constant that can be found by the normalization constraint: `Σ_j q_j = 1`. This constant is the partition function `Z`. So, `q_j = (1/Z) * exp(-βε_j)`, where `Z = Σ_j exp(-βε_j)`.\n    *   **Connecting to Bose-Einstein Statistics:** The above derivation gives the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which is for distinguishable particles. This is where the \"Bose case\" subtlety comes in. The states we are distributing particles into are not single-particle states, but *occupancy numbers* of those states. The entropy calculation needs to account for the indistinguishability of bosons.\n    *   The entropy for a Bose-Einstein gas is given by `S = k_B Σ_i [(n_i + g_i - 1)log(n_i + g_i - 1) - n_i log(n_i) - (g_i - 1)log(g_i - 1)]`, where `n_i` is the number of particles in energy level `i` and `g_i` is the degeneracy of that level. For simplicity, let's assume `g_i=1`. Then `S/k_B = Σ_i [(n_i + 1)log(n_i + 1) - n_i log(n_i)]`.\n    *   We need to maximize this `S` subject to constraints: Total Number `N = Σ_i n_i` and Total Energy `E = Σ_i n_i ε_i`.\n    *   For **light quanta (photons)**, the number of particles `N` is not conserved. So, we only have the total energy constraint. This means the chemical potential is zero (`μ=0`).\n    *   Maximizing `S` subject to `E = Σ_i n_i ε_i` (and `μ=0`) using Lagrange multipliers leads to the famous Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number `<n_i>`:\n        `<n_i> = 1 / (exp(βε_i) - 1)`, where `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n    *   **Equilibrium Mean Energy:** This isn't a single value but a function of temperature. The total mean energy `<E>` is the sum over all energy levels:\n        `<E> = Σ_i <n_i> ε_i = Σ_i ε_i / (exp(βε_i) - 1)`.\n        For a continuous spectrum of energies in a 3D box, this sum becomes an integral over frequencies, leading to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`<E>/V ∝ T^4`).\n    *   **Equilibrium Entropy:** Once we have the equilibrium occupation numbers `<n_i>`, we can plug them back into the entropy formula:\n        `S = k_B Σ_i [(<n_i> + 1)log(<n_i> + 1) - <n_i> log(<n_i>)]`.\n        This expression, using the Bose-Einstein distribution for `<n_i>`, gives the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas.\n\n5.  **Synthesizing the Answer:**\n    *   Start by stating the connection: Large deviation theorems provide a probabilistic foundation for the second law of thermodynamics. The equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state, and the probability of observing other states (large deviations) is exponentially small for a large number of particles.\n    *   Explain Sanov's Theorem: It relates the probability of an empirical distribution to the relative entropy (KL-divergence). Minimizing this rate function, subject to constraints, yields the most probable distribution.\n    *   Explain Cramer's Theorem: It relates the probability of the empirical mean deviating from the true mean. This is connected as the mean energy is a key constraint. The rate function here is the Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function. The two theorems are closely related.\n    *   Apply this to the Bose case for light quanta (photons). The crucial features are that they are indistinguishable bosons and their number is not conserved (chemical potential is zero).\n    *   The quantity to maximize is the statistical entropy `S`, which counts the number of ways to distribute `n_i` indistinguishable particles into energy levels `ε_i`.\n    *   The only constraint is the total mean energy `<E> = Σ n_i ε_i`.\n    *   Maximizing the Bose-Einstein entropy expression under this constraint yields the equilibrium occupation numbers: `<n_i> = 1 / (exp(βε_i) - 1)`, where `β` is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint, later identified as `1/(k_B T)`.\n    *   **Final Answer - Mean Energy:** The equilibrium mean energy `<E>` is not a single number but is determined by the temperature `T` (or `β`). It is given by the sum (or integral over the density of states) of the energies of each level multiplied by their average occupation number: `<E>(T) = Σ_i ε_i / (exp(ε_i / k_B T) - 1)`. This is the Planck radiation formula integrated over all frequencies.\n    *   **Final Answer - Entropy:** The equilibrium entropy `S` is found by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers `<n_i>` back into the statistical entropy formula for bosons: `S(T) = k_B Σ_i [(<n_i> + 1)log(<n_i> + 1) - <n_i> log(<n_i>)]`. This also is a function of temperature.\n\n6.  **Refining the response:** Ensure that every factual claim is backed by a citation from the provided search results. Explain the concepts clearly without getting bogged down in the full mathematical rigor of proofs, as the user is asking to *use* the theorems, not prove them. Structure the response logically, moving from the general theory to the specific application.This problem requires applying principles from large deviation theory to the statistical mechanics of a photon gas, which is described by Bose-Einstein statistics.\n\n### Theoretical Framework: Large Deviations and Statistical Mechanics\n\nLarge deviation theorems, such as the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, provide a mathematical foundation for understanding why macroscopic systems are overwhelmingly likely to be found in their equilibrium state. The core idea is that any state other than equilibrium represents a \"large deviation\" from the average behavior, and the probability of observing such a state is exponentially small as the number of particles (N) becomes large.\n\n*   **Sanov's Theorem:** This theorem deals with the probability that the *empirical distribution* of a sample deviates from the true underlying probability distribution. The probability of observing a particular macroscopic state (macrostate) is proportional to the number of microscopic states (microstates) that realize it. Sanov's theorem formalizes Boltzmann's insight that the probability of observing a macrostate described by a distribution `q`, given a reference distribution `p`, is approximately `exp(-N * D_KL(q||p))`, where `D_KL(q||p)` is the Kullback-Leibler divergence or relative entropy. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes this rate function subject to physical constraints.\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem is related and addresses the probability that the *empirical mean* of a set of random variables deviates from the expected value. In statistical mechanics, this is relevant to constraining the average energy of the system.\n\nThe equilibrium state of a system is the macrostate with the maximum entropy, subject to constraints like a fixed average energy. From the perspective of large deviation theory, this is the most probable state, as all other states are exponentially less likely.\n\n### Application to Light Quanta (Photon Gas)\n\nFor the case of light quanta (photons) in thermal equilibrium, we must consider two key properties derived from Bose-Einstein statistics:\n1.  Photons are bosons, meaning any number of them can occupy the same energy state. They are also indistinguishable.\n2.  The total number of photons in a system is not conserved because they can be emitted and absorbed by the walls of their container. This implies that the chemical potential for a photon gas is zero.\n\nThe problem of finding the equilibrium values reduces to finding the distribution of photons over energy levels that maximizes the entropy for a given total average energy.\n\n#### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nTo find the equilibrium distribution, we maximize the Boltzmann entropy, which for bosons is given by:\n`S = k_B * Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i - 1)ln(n_i + g_i - 1) - n_i*ln(n_i) - (g_i - 1)ln(g_i - 1) ]`\nwhere `n_i` is the number of photons in the energy level `ε_i` and `g_i` is the degeneracy (number of states with that energy). For simplicity, we can consider non-degenerate states (`g_i = 1`).\n\nThe sole constraint on this system is the fixed mean energy:\n`<E> = Σ_i n_i * ε_i`\n\nUsing the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize entropy subject to the energy constraint (and with zero chemical potential), we find the most probable, or equilibrium, average occupation number `<n_i>` for an energy level `ε_i`. This is the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for photons (also known as the Planck distribution):\n\n`<n_i> = 1 / (exp(βε_i) - 1)`\n\nHere, `β` is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint, which is identified with the inverse temperature, `β = 1 / (k_B * T)`.\n\nTherefore, the **equilibrium mean energy** of the photon gas is not a constant but a function of temperature, determined by summing over all possible energy states:\n\n**`<E>(T) = Σ_i ε_i / (exp(ε_i / (k_B*T)) - 1)`**\n\nThis expression is the foundation of the Planck radiation formula, which describes the spectrum of black-body radiation.\n\n#### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe **equilibrium value of the entropy** is found by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers `<n_i>` back into the entropy formula for bosons. For non-degenerate states, this yields:\n\n**`S(T) = k_B * Σ_i [ (<n_i> + 1)ln(<n_i> + 1) - <n_i>*ln(<n_i>) ]`**\n\nBy substituting the expression for `<n_i>` from the Bose-Einstein distribution, we get:\n\n**`S(T) = k_B * Σ_i [ (1 / (exp(ε_i / (k_B*T)) - 1)) * (ε_i / T) - k_B * ln(1 - exp(-ε_i / (k_B*T))) ]`**\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium entropy, like the mean energy, is a function of the system's temperature. This result is consistent with the third law of thermodynamics, as the entropy approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values for a system of light quanta (photons) are not single numerical values but are functions of temperature (T).\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Mean Energy `<E>`:**\n    The mean energy is given by the sum of the energy of each state multiplied by its equilibrium occupation number according to the Bose-Einstein distribution:\n    `<E>(T) = Σ_i ε_i / (exp(ε_i / (k_B*T)) - 1)`\n    where `ε_i` is the energy of the i-th state and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Entropy `S`:**\n    The entropy is determined by plugging the equilibrium occupation numbers `<n_i> = 1 / (exp(ε_i / (k_B*T)) - 1)` into the statistical formula for the entropy of bosons:\n    `S(T) = k_B * Σ_i [ (<n_i> + 1)ln(<n_i> + 1) - <n_i>*ln(<n_i>) ]`\n    This evaluates to:\n    `S(T) = (1/T) * <E>(T) - k_B * Σ_i ln(1 - exp(-ε_i / (k_B*T)))`"
