    "The compound obtained from the reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide first with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF, followed by methyl iodide, is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Directed *ortho*-Metalation (DoM)**: The first step involves a directed *ortho*-metalation reaction. The N,N-diethylcarboxamide (-CONEt₂) and the N,N-dimethylamino (-NMe₂) groups on the benzene ring are both directing metalation groups (DMGs). They use their heteroatoms (oxygen and nitrogen, respectively) to coordinate the lithium from the sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi). This coordination directs the deprotonation to an adjacent (*ortho*) carbon. The combination of sec-BuLi and the chelating agent TMEDA creates a highly reactive strong base.\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is one of the most powerful known DMGs. It directs deprotonation to the C2 and C6 positions. The dimethylamino group directs to the C2 and C4 positions. The C2 position is uniquely positioned *ortho* to both directing groups. This cooperative effect makes the proton at C2 the most acidic on the ring, leading to its selective removal. This forms a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate, N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n3.  **Electrophilic Quench**: In the second step, methyl iodide (CH₃I) is introduced as an electrophile. The nucleophilic carbon at the C2 position of the aryllithium intermediate attacks the methyl group of the methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final product of this two-step sequence is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
