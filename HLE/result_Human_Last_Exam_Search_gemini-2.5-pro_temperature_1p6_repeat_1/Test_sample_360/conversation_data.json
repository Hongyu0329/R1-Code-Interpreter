    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a single chemical product is formed, which exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers. Therefore, two isomeric products are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands in `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` by the bidentate ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole. The resulting product is a cationic octahedral complex, `[Ru(bpy)2(2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)]^2+`.\n\nAn octahedral complex containing three bidentate ligands, such as the product of this reaction, is chiral. This means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and therefore exists as a pair of enantiomers. These enantiomers are designated by the stereochemical descriptors Δ (delta) for the right-handed propeller-like arrangement of the ligands and Λ (lambda) for the left-handed arrangement.\n\nUnless the reaction is carried out using a single enantiomer of the starting material and proceeds with complete retention of configuration, or if a chiral resolving agent is used, the product will be a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the Δ and Λ enantiomers. Thus, two distinct isomers are formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<2>>>"
