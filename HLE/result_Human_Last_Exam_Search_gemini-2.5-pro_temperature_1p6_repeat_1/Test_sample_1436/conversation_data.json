    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is a crucial element in perturbative calculations, ensuring that equivalent topological structures arising from Wick's theorem are not overcounted. To determine this factor for a diagram with two vertices and four field contractions, we must first establish the diagram's precise topology. The most direct interpretation of \"two vertices and four field contractions\" in a common theory like φ⁴ theory is a vacuum diagram where two vertices are connected to each other by four propagators (lines).\n\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by S, can be calculated by considering the permutations of the diagram's components (vertices and lines) that leave the diagram's topology unchanged. The general formula for the symmetry factor is the order of the diagram's automorphism group.\n\nFor the specified diagram:\n*   **Two vertices:** These vertices are indistinguishable as they are integrated over all of spacetime in the perturbative expansion. Swapping these two vertices results in the same diagram. This contributes a factor of 2! = 2 to the symmetry factor.\n*   **Four field contractions:** This corresponds to four identical propagators connecting the two vertices. These lines can be permuted among themselves in any way without changing the diagram. This contributes a factor of 4! = 24.\n\nCombining these two sources of symmetry, the total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors.\n\n**Calculation:**\nThe symmetry factor (S) is calculated as:\nS = (Number of permutations of identical vertices) × (Number of permutations of identical lines connecting them)\nS = 2! × 4!\nS = 2 × 24\nS = 48\n\nThis can be confirmed by considering the number of ways to form the diagram via Wick contractions. For a φ⁴ interaction, the diagram arises from the second-order term in the Dyson series, which has a prefactor of 1/2!. The interaction vertices themselves carry a factor of 1/4! each. The number of ways to contract the eight fields (four from each vertex) to form this specific diagram is 4! = 24. The overall numerical factor multiplying the integral is therefore (1/2!) × (1/4!)² × 24 = 1/48. In the Feynman rules formalism, this overall coefficient is written as 1/S, which confirms that S = 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
