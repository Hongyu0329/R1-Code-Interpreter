    "Let $S = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$ be a schema with four unary predicates. We want to determine the VC dimension of the concept class defined by the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept Class**\n\nThe concepts are sets of domain elements that satisfy a given formula. The classifiers are the formulas themselves, which have one free variable (let's call it $x$). A concept class is the set of all such concepts. The VC dimension of the logic fragment is the maximum VC dimension over all possible interpretations (models) of the predicates in $S$.\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is built using:\n*   Atomic formulas: $P_i(y)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, where $y$ is any variable.\n*   Conjunction: $\\land$\n*   Existential quantification: $\\exists$\n*   Constants: $\\top$ (true) and $\\bot$ (false).\n\n**2. Simplification via Quantifier Elimination**\n\nA key property of first-order logic with only unary predicates (monadic first-order logic) is that it admits quantifier elimination. Let's see how this applies to our fragment.\n\nConsider a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$. Any formula in this fragment can be constructed by applying existential quantifiers to a quantifier-free core. A quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since the predicates are all unary, we can group the atoms by the variable they apply to:\n$\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k) = \\psi_0(x) \\land \\psi_1(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_k(y_k)$\nwhere each $\\psi_j(z)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving only the variable $z$. For instance, $\\psi_0(x)$ could be $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n\nNow, let's apply the existential quantifiers, for example $\\exists y_1$:\n$\\exists y_1 . \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k) = \\exists y_1 . (\\psi_0(x) \\land \\psi_1(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_k(y_k))$\nSince $\\psi_0(x), \\psi_2(y_2), \\dots$ do not contain the variable $y_1$, we can pull them out of the quantifier:\n$= \\psi_0(x) \\land (\\exists y_1 . \\psi_1(y_1)) \\land \\psi_2(y_2) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_k(y_k)$\n\nThe term $(\\exists y_1 . \\psi_1(y_1))$ is a *sentence* (a formula with no free variables). For any given model, this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If it is false, the entire formula is equivalent to $\\bot$.\n*   If it is true, the formula is equivalent to $\\psi_0(x) \\land \\psi_2(y_2) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_k(y_k)$.\n\nBy repeatedly eliminating all existentially quantified variables ($y_1, \\dots, y_k$), the original formula $\\phi(x)$ simplifies to one of two forms:\n1.  $\\bot$ (the false formula, defining the empty set).\n2.  A conjunction of the form $\\psi_0(x) \\land S$, where $\\psi_0(x)$ is a quantifier-free formula in the variable $x$, and $S$ is a conjunction of true sentences. This is equivalent to just $\\psi_0(x)$.\n\nA quantifier-free formula $\\psi_0(x)$ in our fragment is a conjunction of some subset of the atomic formulas $\\{P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)\\}$. For instance, $P_1(x) \\land P_4(x)$.\n\nTherefore, any concept defined by $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ can also be defined by a simpler formula of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The set $I = \\emptyset$ corresponds to the formula $\\top$ (the true formula), which defines the entire domain. The formula $\\bot$ defines the empty set.\n\nThe concept class is thus the class formed by all possible intersections of the base sets corresponding to the four predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n\n**3. Calculating the VC Dimension**\n\nWe need to find the VC dimension of the concept class $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$, where $P_i^M$ is the interpretation of the predicate $P_i$ in a model $M$.\n\n**Lower Bound (VC dim $\\ge 4$)**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must find a model and a set of 4 points within it that can be shattered.\nLet's construct such a model. Let the universe contain the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We define our four predicates on this set as follows:\n*   $P_1 = X \\setminus \\{x_1\\} = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_2 = X \\setminus \\{x_2\\} = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_3 = X \\setminus \\{x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_4 = X \\setminus \\{x_4\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nWe must show that any subset $Y \\subseteq X$ can be generated by an intersection of these four sets.\nLet $Y$ be any subset of $X$. Let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$. Consider the concept $C_Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i$.\nAn element $x_j \\in X$ belongs to $C_Y$ if and only if $x_j \\in P_i$ for all $i \\in I_Y$. By our definition of the predicates, $x_j \\in P_i$ if and only if $j \\neq i$.\nSo, $x_j \\in C_Y$ if and only if $j \\neq i$ for all $i \\in I_Y$. This means the index $j$ is not in $I_Y$, which by definition of $I_Y$ means $x_j \\in Y$.\nThus, $C_Y \\cap X = Y$.\nThis shows we can generate any of the $2^4=16$ subsets of $X$. For example, to obtain the subset $\\{x_1\\}$, we need to exclude $x_2, x_3, x_4$. We thus intersect the predicates that exclude them: $P_2 \\cap P_3 \\cap P_4 = \\{x_1\\}$. To obtain the subset $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$, we intersect $P_3 \\cap P_4 = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$.\nSince we have constructed a set of size 4 that can be shattered, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Upper Bound (VC dim $\\le 4$)**\nThe number of distinct concepts is limited by the number of distinct formulas that define them. As we've shown, our concepts are defined by formulas of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. Since there are 4 predicates, there are $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets $I$, and thus at most 16 distinct formulas (concepts).\n\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, the concept class must be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets.\nIf we were to shatter a set of size 5, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ distinct subsets.\nHowever, our concept class can provide at most 16 distinct subsets. Since $16 < 32$, it is impossible to shatter a set of size 5. Therefore, the VC dimension must be less than 5.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that VC dim $\\ge 4$ and VC dim $< 5$. Since the VC dimension must be an integer, we conclude that the VC dimension is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
