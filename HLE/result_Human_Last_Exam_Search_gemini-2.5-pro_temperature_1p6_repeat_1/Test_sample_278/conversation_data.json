    "To determine the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we first need to find the extent of the curve in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is given by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\begin{cases} \\sin t & \\text{if } t \\in [0, \\pi] \\\\ 5\\sin t & \\text{if } t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi) \\end{cases}$\n\nFirst, let's find the range of the x-coordinates. The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The range of the cosine function over this interval is $[-1, 1]$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of x is -1, and the maximum value of x is 1. The total width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nNext, let's find the range of the y-coordinates. The definition of y is piecewise.\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$. In this interval, $\\sin t$ ranges from 0 to 1. So, the maximum y-value in this part is 1.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin t$. In this interval, $\\sin t$ ranges from -1 to 0 (not including 0). Therefore, $5\\sin t$ ranges from -5 to 0. The minimum y-value in this part is -5, which occurs at $t=3\\pi/2$.\n\nCombining both intervals, the y-values for the entire figure range from -5 to 1. The total height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure is contained within a bounding box of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can outcircle, or circumscribe, this bounding box must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n\nSide length of the smallest square = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>To determine the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we first need to find the extent of the curve in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is given by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\begin{cases} \\sin t & \\text{if } t \\in [0, \\pi] \\\\ 5\\sin t & \\text{if } t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi) \\end{cases}$\n\nFirst, let's find the range of the x-coordinates.
