    "### Maya Glyphs Offer Earliest Securely Dated Record in the Americas\n\nThe earliest known and securely dated record by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas is a Maya glyph for \"7 Deer,\" discovered at the San Bartolo archaeological site in Guatemala. Radiocarbon dating of the painted mural fragments places this inscription between 300 and 200 BCE. This finding represents the most definitive evidence of the 260-day divinatory calendar in use at this early period.\n\nThe \"7 Deer\" glyph was found on plaster fragments that were part of a larger mural within the Las Pinturas pyramid complex. The secure dating comes from the sealed archaeological context in which the fragments were discovered, providing a reliable timeframe for their creation. This discovery establishes a firm benchmark for the history of writing and calendrical systems in Mesoamerica, demonstrating a mature artistic and scribal tradition among the Maya earlier than previously confirmed.\n\nWhile the \"7 Deer\" glyph is the most reliably dated, other, potentially older, recorded dates from different civilizations exist, though their exact ages and interpretations are subject to more scholarly debate.\n\nOne significant contender is **Zapotec Monument 3 from San José Mogote** in Oaxaca, Mexico. This carved stone slab depicts a sacrificed captive with a hieroglyphic inscription between his legs, interpreted as his name or the day of his sacrifice, \"1 Earthquake\" or \"1 Motion.\" Some scholars date this monument to as early as 600 BCE, which would make it the oldest known recorded date. However, this dating is controversial, with other analyses suggesting the monument may be significantly younger. Furthermore, the precise reading and whether it represents a name or a date is also a matter of ongoing discussion.\n\nEven earlier evidence comes from the **Olmec civilization**. At San Andrés, near the major Olmec center of La Venta in Tabasco, Mexico, a ceramic cylinder seal and greenstone plaque fragments were found, dating to around 650 BCE. One of the glyphs has been interpreted as \"3 Ajaw,\" a day in the 260-day calendar that could represent a date or the name of a ruler. However, this interpretation is highly debated, with some experts cautioning that the symbols may be iconographic elements rather than true writing representing a specific date.\n\nIt is also important to note the **Cascajal Block**, another Olmec artifact discovered in Veracruz, Mexico, which dates to approximately 900 BCE. This tablet is considered by many to be the oldest example of writing in the Americas. However, the 62 distinct glyphs on the block are undeciphered and do not include any recognizable calendrical information, so it does not contain a recorded date.\n\nIn summary, while the Olmec and Zapotec civilizations present tantalizing possibilities for earlier recorded dates, the Maya \"7 Deer\" glyph from San Bartolo provides the earliest scientifically and archaeologically secure evidence of a date recorded in an aboriginal writing system in the Americas.\n\n<<<The \"7 Deer\" glyph, from between 300 and 200 BCE, is the earliest securely dated record.>>>"
