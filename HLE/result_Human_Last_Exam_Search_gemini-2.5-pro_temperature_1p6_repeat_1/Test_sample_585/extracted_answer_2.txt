```latex
\Sigma' = G \Sigma G^T
```
where
```latex
G = I - \frac{1}{2}[\mu]_{\times} + \left( \frac{1}{\|\mu\|^2} - \frac{1 + \cos(\|\mu\|)}{2\|\mu\|\sin(\|\mu\|)} \right) [\mu]_{\times}^2
```
Here, `\(I\)` is the 3x3 identity matrix, `\(\mu\)` is the mean of the pre-reset attitude deviation vector, `\(\|\mu\|\)` is its norm, and `\([\mu]_{\times}\)` is the skew-symmetric matrix of `\(\mu\)`.
