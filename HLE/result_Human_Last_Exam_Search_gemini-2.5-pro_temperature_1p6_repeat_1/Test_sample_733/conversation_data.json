    "There are exactly four finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. These groups are:\n\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C₅.\n*   The cyclic group of order 6, denoted as C₆.\n*   The symmetric group on 3 elements, denoted as S₃, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 6, D₆.\n*   The dihedral group of order 8, denoted as D₈.\n\nA set *S* within a group *G* is defined as product-free if for any elements *a*, *b*, and *c* in *S* (which are not necessarily distinct), the relation *ab* = *c* does not hold. A product-free set is called maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was completed by Giudici and Hart. Subsequent works on locally maximal product-free sets of larger sizes, such as those by Anabanti and Hart, often reference this foundational classification. For instance, the study of groups with maximal product-free sets of size 3 builds upon the established results for sizes 1 and 2.\n\nThe investigation into these small maximal product-free sets is part of a broader effort in combinatorial group theory to understand the structure of groups through their subsets with specific properties. This area of research connects to other mathematical fields, including graph theory and finite geometry.\n\n<<<4>>>"
