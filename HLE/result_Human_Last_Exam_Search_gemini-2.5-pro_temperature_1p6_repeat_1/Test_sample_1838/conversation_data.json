    "To determine the coordinates of the central pixel of a line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, one must first generate all the pixel coordinates along the line and then identify the centermost pixel from that sequence.\n\nBresenham's algorithm is a method for drawing lines on a grid of pixels. It uses integer arithmetic to efficiently determine which pixels should be plotted to form a close approximation of a straight line.\n\nFor the line from (1,1) to (11,5), the steps are as follows:\n*   **Calculate the change in x and y:**\n    *   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n*   **Calculate the initial decision parameter:**\n    *   p = 2 * Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n*   **Iterate and determine the pixel coordinates:**\n    Starting from (1,1), the algorithm determines subsequent pixels based on the decision parameter.\n\nThe sequence of pixels generated by the algorithm is:\n(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), **(6, 3)**, (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels on this line. The central pixel is the sixth one in this sequence.\n\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<**(6, 3)**>>>"
