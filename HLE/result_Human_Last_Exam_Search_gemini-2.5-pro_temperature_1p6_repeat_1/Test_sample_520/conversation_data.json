    "During World War II, the Belgian refugee who falsely claimed to be a waiter and was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence was, in reality, the public executioner of a city in Flanders. This fact was concealed from his interrogators.\n\nThe case was handled by the Dutch counter-espionage officer Lieutenant-Colonel Oreste Pinto, who was renowned for his interrogation skills. Pinto and his team became suspicious of a Belgian refugee who insisted he had been a hotel waiter for many years. This story was eventually revealed to be a cover for his true, and to him, more shameful, profession. The story of this refugee was later dramatized in the \"Spycatcher\" television series, based on Pinto's memoirs.\n\nWhile the name \"Andre Vernault\" is associated with this story, it is likely a pseudonym used in the dramatization or subsequent retellings of the event.\n\n<<<The public executioner of a city in Flanders>>>"
