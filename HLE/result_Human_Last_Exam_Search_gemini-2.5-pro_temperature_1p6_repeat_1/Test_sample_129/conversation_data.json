    "Here is a systematic breakdown of all possible true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n\nThe precedence of operators is ! > & > |, and operators of the same precedence are left-associative. The length of an expression is the number of symbols used.\n\nWe can categorize the expressions by their structure:\n\n### 1. Expressions with three constants (T/F) and two operators\n\nThis structure is of the form `C op C op C`. There are 5 symbols.\n*   **`C & C & C`**: For this to be true, all constants must be 'T'. This gives one expression: `T&T&T`.\n*   **`C | C | C`**: For this to be true, at least one constant must be 'T'. Out of the 8 possible combinations of T/F, only `F|F|F` is false. This gives 7 true expressions.\n*   **`C & C | C`**: Due to precedence, this is parsed as `(C & C) | C`. It's true if C3 is 'T' (4 combinations), or if C3 is 'F' and C1 and C2 are 'T' (1 combination). This gives 5 true expressions.\n*   **`C | C & C`**: This is parsed as `C | (C & C)`. It's true if C1 is 'T' (4 combinations), or if C1 is 'F' and C2 and C3 are 'T' (1 combination). This gives 5 true expressions.\nTotal for this category: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18.\n\n### 2. Expressions involving parentheses\n\n*   **`(C op C)`**: These expressions use 5 symbols: '(', C, op, C, ')'.\n    *   True expressions: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`.\n    *   Total: 4.\n*   **`C op (C)`**: These use 5 symbols: C, op, '(', C, ')'.\n    *   True expressions: `T&(T)`, `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`.\n    *   Total: 4.\n*   **`(C) op C`**: These use 5 symbols: '(', C, ')', op, C.\n    *   True expressions: `(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`.\n    *   Total: 4.\n\n### 3. Expressions involving the '!' operator\n\n*   **`!C op !C`**: These use 5 symbols: '!', C, op, '!', C. This is parsed as `(!C) op (!C)`.\n    *   True expressions: `!F&!F`, `!F|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!T|!F`.\n    *   Total: 4.\n*   **`!!(C)`**: These use 5 symbols: '!', '!', '(', C, ')'. This is parsed as `!(!((C)))`.\n    *   True expression: `!!(T)`.\n    *   Total: 1.\n*   **`!!C op C`**: These use 5 symbols: '!', '!', C, op, C. This is parsed as `(!(!C)) op C`.\n    *   `!!T` evaluates to T, `!!F` evaluates to F.\n    *   True expressions: `!!T&T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`.\n    *   Total: 4.\n*   **`C op !!C`**: This is the symmetric case to the above.\n    *   True expressions: `T&!!T`, `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`.\n    *   Total: 4.\n*   **`C op !(C)`**: These use 5 symbols: C, op, '!', '(', C, ')'. This is parsed as `C op (!(C))`.\n    *   `!(T)` is F, `!(F)` is T.\n    *   True expressions: `T&!(F)`, `T|!(T)`, `T|!(F)`, `F|!(F)`.\n    *   Total: 4.\n*   **`!(C) op C`**: This is the symmetric case to the above.\n    *   True expressions: `!(F)&T`, `!(F)|T`, `!(F)|F`, `!(T)|T`.\n    *   Total: 4.\n\nSumming up all disjoint sets of expressions:\n*   `C op C op C`: 18\n*   `(C op C)`: 4\n*   `C op (C)`: 4\n*   `(C) op C`: 4\n*   `!C op !C`: 4\n*   `!!(C)`: 1\n*   `!!C op C`: 4\n*   `C op !!C`: 4\n*   `C op !(C)`: 4\n*   `!(C) op C`: 4\n\nTotal = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51.\n\n<<<51>>>"
