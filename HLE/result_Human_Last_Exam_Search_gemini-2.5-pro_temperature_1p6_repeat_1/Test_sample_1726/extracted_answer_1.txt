In a Euclidean spacetime, effects #1 (relativity of simultaneity), #2 (relativity of lengths), #3 (relativity of time), and #5 (non-Newtonian addition of speeds) would likely still be true in some form, often interpreted as geometric projection effects. However, #4 (invariance of the speed of light), a cornerstone of modern physics, would be false. The formulas for #2, #3, and #5 would differ from the standard ones in Special Relativity.
