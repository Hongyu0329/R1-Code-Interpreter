    "I am unable to provide a definitive count of the \"pas de Balanchines\" Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo scene of the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nMy research has confirmed that Svetlana Gileva, a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett, did perform in William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" during the 2015 season. A video from a performance on November 9, 2015, specifically identifies her as the dancer in the \"Jete Woman solo\".\n\nHowever, the video of this specific performance is no longer accessible. Despite extensive searches, no other publicly available recordings of Svetlana Gileva performing this particular solo from 2015 could be located.\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a standard, formally defined step in the ballet lexicon but rather refers to a stylistic quality and choreographic approach influenced by George Balanchine, which William Forsythe incorporates and deconstructs in his work. Therefore, a visual analysis of the specific performance is essential to identify and quantify these movements accurately.\n\nWithout a viewable copy of Svetlana Gileva's performance, it is impossible to determine the number of \"pas de Balanchines\" she executed. There are other videos from the Semperoper Ballett's 2015 production of this ballet, but they feature other dancers in different roles.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question as a video of the specified performance is not publicly available, which is necessary for the visual analysis required to count the choreographic movements in question.>>>"
