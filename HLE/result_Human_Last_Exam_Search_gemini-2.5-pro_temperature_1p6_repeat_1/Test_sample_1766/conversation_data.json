    "### Solution for the Common Eigenvalues of J² and Jz for a p-Electron\n\nFor a single p-electron, the determination of the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and its projection onto the z-axis, $J_z$, is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics that illustrates the concept of spin-orbit coupling.\n\n**1. Identifying the Angular Momentum Quantum Numbers:**\n\n*   A **p-electron** is characterized by an orbital angular momentum quantum number, **l = 1**.\n*   Like all electrons, it has an intrinsic spin angular momentum quantum number, **s = 1/2**.\n\n**2. Determining the Total Angular Momentum Quantum Number (j):**\n\nIn the presence of spin-orbit interaction, the orbital angular momentum (**L**) and spin angular momentum (**S**) are no longer individually conserved. Instead, they couple to form a total angular momentum, **J = L + S**, which is conserved.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are found by combining *l* and *s*:\n\n*j* can take values from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\n\nFor a p-electron:\n*   *j<sub>min</sub>* = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   *j<sub>max</sub>* = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThus, the two possible values for *j* are **1/2** and **3/2**. These correspond to two distinct energy levels, often denoted by the term symbols ²P₁/₂ and ²P₃/₂.\n\n**3. Finding the Eigenvalues:**\n\nThe operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ commute, which means they share a common set of eigenstates, denoted by |*j*, *m<sub>j</sub>*⟩. We can therefore find their eigenvalues simultaneously.\n\n*   The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula: **ħ² *j*(*j* + 1)**.\n*   The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by: **ħ *m<sub>j</sub>***, where *m<sub>j</sub>* is the total magnetic quantum number. For a given *j*, *m<sub>j</sub>* can take on 2*j* + 1 values, from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nWe now calculate these eigenvalues for the two possible values of *j*.\n\n***\n\n### **Case 1: j = 3/2**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²:**\n    ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = ħ² * (3/2) * (5/2) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz:**\n    The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. This gives four degenerate states (in the absence of an external magnetic field). The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n    *   ** (3/2)ħ**\n    *   ** (1/2)ħ**\n    *   **-(1/2)ħ**\n    *   **-(3/2)ħ**\n\n### **Case 2: j = 1/2**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²:**\n    ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = ħ² * (1/2) * (3/2) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz:**\n    The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -1/2 and 1/2. This gives two degenerate states. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n    *   ** (1/2)ħ**\n    *   **-(1/2)ħ**\n\n***\n\n**Summary of Common Eigenvalues**\n\nThe set of common eigenvalues for the $J^2$ and $J_z$ operators for a p-electron are given as pairs (Eigenvalue of J², Eigenvalue of Jz):\n\n| Total Angular Momentum Quantum Number (j) | Eigenvalue of J² | Total Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j) | Eigenvalue of J_z |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **3/2** | **(15/4)ħ²** | 3/2 | **(3/2)ħ** |\n| | | 1/2 | **(1/2)ħ** |\n| | | -1/2 | **-(1/2)ħ** |\n| | | -3/2 | **-(3/2)ħ** |\n| **1/2** | **(3/4)ħ²** | 1/2 | **(1/2)ħ** |\n| | | -1/2 | **-(1/2)ħ** |\n\n<<<The common eigenvalues for (J², Jz) are:\nFor j = 3/2: The eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of Jz are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, -(1/2)ħ, and -(3/2)ħ.\nFor j = 1/2: The eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of Jz are (1/2)ħ and -(1/2)ħ.>>>"
