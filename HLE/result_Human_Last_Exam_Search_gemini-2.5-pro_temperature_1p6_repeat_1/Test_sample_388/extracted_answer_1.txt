Based on the information, a pharmacist could counsel Allison on several points. Firstly, headaches are a common side effect of all three of her prescribed medications: Atorvastatin, Junel Fe 1.5/30, and Fluoxetine. Her headache could also be related to residual motion sickness from her cruise.

Secondly, the smell of seawater is an olfactory hallucination (phantosmia). While it could be linked to a sinus or upper respiratory infection from her travels, it's also a rare but documented side effect of medications, including antidepressants like fluoxetine and lipid-lowering agents like atorvastatin. It can also be a symptom of a migraine aura. Given that this is a new and unusual symptom, it is important for her to report this to her doctor.

Thirdly, there are potential interactions between her medications. Taking fluoxetine with Excedrin (which contains aspirin) can increase the risk of bleeding. Atorvastatin can increase the hormone levels from her Junel Fe, which may heighten the risk of its side effects. Additionally, the caffeine in Excedrin may have a more pronounced effect while on oral contraceptives.

Therefore, the pharmacist's primary recommendation should be for Allison to continue her prescribed medications but to follow up with her doctor to discuss the new onset of headaches and the phantom smell. The pharmacist should also advise her to be cautious with the use of Excedrin due to the bleeding risk with fluoxetine and to be aware of the other potential drug interactions.
