The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor due to weak localization can be evaluated as approximately **δσ ≈ - (e²/ħ) * (1/l_φ - 1/l)**, where `e` is the elementary charge, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `l` is the electron's mean free path, and `l_φ` is the phase coherence length. Given that `l_φ` >> `l` in the weak localization regime, this correction is small and negative.
