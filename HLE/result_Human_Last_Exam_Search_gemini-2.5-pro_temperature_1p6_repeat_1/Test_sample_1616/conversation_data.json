    "The word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing among the given options is **shadow**.\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a sound change process in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is located in the third syllable from the end of a word, particularly when a suffix is added. This phenomenon typically applies to words of Latin or Greek origin.\n\nHere's an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **southern**: The vowel change from *south* (/aʊ/) to *southern* (/ʌ/) is often cited as an irregular example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **derivative**: This word demonstrates the classic pattern of trisyllabic laxing, with the tense vowel /aɪ/ in *derive* changing to the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*.\n*   **serenity**: This is a clear example of trisyllabic laxing, where the tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity*.\n*   **gratitude**: The vowel change from the /eɪ/ sound in the related word *grateful* to the /æ/ sound in *gratitude* is an example of trisyllabic laxing. The process is traced back to the Latin word *gratus*.\n*   **pleasant**: The vowel change from the tense /iː/ in *please* to the lax /ɛ/ in *pleasant* is an example of a different process called disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: Similarly to *pleasant*, the vowel change from the tense /eɪ/ in *shade* to the lax /æ/ in *shadow* is explicitly identified as a type of disyllabic laxing, a distinct process from trisyllabic laxing. The word itself is of Old English origin.\n\nBoth *pleasant* and *shadow* have undergone a type of vowel laxing, but it is not the trisyllabic laxing process. Since the question asks for a single word, and both fit the description of not having undergone *trisyllabic* laxing, there is some ambiguity. However, the evolution of *shade* to *shadow* is a very distinct native English process, often contrasted with the largely Latin-derived words affected by trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
