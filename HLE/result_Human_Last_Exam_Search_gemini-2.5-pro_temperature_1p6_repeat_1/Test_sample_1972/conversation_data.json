    "Jorge Luis Borges was referring to the novel **El sueño de los héroes** (*The Dream of Heroes*) by **Adolfo Bioy Casares**.\n\nIn a 1955 review published in the literary magazine *Sur*, Borges praised this novel by his close friend and collaborator. Within that review, he described the work as having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" Furthermore, Borges saw Bioy Casares's narrative style in this work as an evolution of William Faulkner's, referring to him as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This connection is reinforced by Borges's own writings where he groups Bioy Casares with Faulkner in their use of complex temporal and spatial narrative structures.\n\n*El sueño de los héroes*, first published in 1954, is considered a masterpiece of Argentine literature. The story follows the protagonist, Emilio Gauna, as he tries to reconstruct the mysterious, forgotten events of three feverish nights of carnival in Buenos Aires. The novel explores Borgesian themes such as destiny, memory, and the nature of heroism, leading some to call it the novel that Borges himself would have liked to have written.\n\n<<<El sueño de los héroes by Adolfo Bioy Casares>>>"
