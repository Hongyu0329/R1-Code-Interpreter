    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra homology with trivial coefficients.\n\nThe given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n\nThis Lie algebra has a specific structure. It can be recognized as a fiber product of two smaller, well-known nilpotent Lie algebras. Let $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ be the 4-dimensional filiform nilpotent Lie algebra with basis $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$ and relations $[x_1, x_2] = x_3, [x_1, x_3] = x_4$. Let $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ be the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra with basis $\\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\}$ and relation $[y_1, y_2] = y_3$.\n\nThe algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is isomorphic to the fiber product $\\mathfrak{g}_1 \\times_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathfrak{g}_2$, where the product is over the one-dimensional subalgebra spanned by $x_1$ in $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $y_1$ in $\\mathfrak{g}_2$. This identification can be seen by mapping the generators of $\\mathfrak{g}$ as follows: $e_1 \\mapsto (x_1, y_1)$, $e_2 \\mapsto (x_2, 0)$, $e_3 \\mapsto (x_3, 0)$, $e_4 \\mapsto (x_4, 0)$, $e_5 \\mapsto (0, y_2)$, $e_6 \\mapsto (0, y_3)$.\n\nFor a fiber product of Lie algebras of this type, the Poincaré polynomial can be computed using the Poincaré polynomials of its constituents through the formula:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)}{P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x)}$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomials for these constituent Lie algebras are known:\n*   For the 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra $\\mathbb{R}$, $P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = 1 + x$.\n*   For the 4-dimensional filiform Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ (often denoted $\\mathfrak{n}_4$), the Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)$. Thus, its Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n*   For the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ (often denoted $\\mathfrak{h}_3$), the Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3) = (1, 2, 2, 1)$. Its Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n\nWe can factor $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)$ as $(1+x)(1+x+x^2)$.\nSubstituting these polynomials into the formula:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)}{1 + x}$\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) (1+x)(1+x+x^2)}{1 + x}$\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)(1+x+x^2)$\n\nExpanding this product:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1)(1+x+x^2) + (2x)(1+x+x^2) + (3x^2)(1+x+x^2) + (2x^3)(1+x+x^2) + (x^4)(1+x+x^2)$\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1+x+x^2) + (2x+2x^2+2x^3) + (3x^2+3x^3+3x^4) + (2x^3+2x^4+2x^5) + (x^4+x^5+x^6)$\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = 1 + (1+2)x + (1+2+3)x^2 + (2+3+2)x^3 + (3+2+1)x^4 + (2+1)x^5 + x^6$\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 7x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nThe resulting Betti numbers for $\\mathfrak{g}$ are $(1, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3, 1)$. As a check, the first Betti number $b_1$ must equal the dimension of the abelianization of $\\mathfrak{g}$, which is $\\dim(\\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}])$. The derived algebra $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$ is spanned by $\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$, so its dimension is 3. Thus, $b_1 = 6 - 3 = 3$, which matches the coefficient of $x$ in our resulting polynomial.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 7*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
