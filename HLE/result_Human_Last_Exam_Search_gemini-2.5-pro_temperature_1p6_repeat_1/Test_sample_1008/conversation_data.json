    "Music, sound effects, speech<<<>>>\nMusic is paramount in dance scenes, as it dictates the rhythm, tempo, and emotional undertone of the choreography. The dance itself serves as a form of non-verbal storytelling, with the music as its fundamental guide.\n\nFollowing music in importance are sound effects. These sounds, such as the tapping of dance shoes or the rustle of clothing, are often added in post-production through a process called foley. They enhance the realism of the dance and add a layer of texture to the scene, accentuating the dancers' movements.\n\nFinally, speech generally holds the lowest priority in a dance sequence. In many instances, the storytelling is conveyed through the dance and music, rendering dialogue unnecessary. While some dance scenes do incorporate dialogue to build character or advance the plot, it is often recorded separately and mixed into the scene in a way that doesn't overpower the primary elements of music and the sounds of the dance. A general principle in film sound is that dialogue is a top priority; however, this hierarchy can be adjusted to serve the needs of a particular scene."
