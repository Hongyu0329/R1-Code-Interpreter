    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Tongan Flag Matrix\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. This canton, in turn, contains a red couped cross. Let's represent the colors red and white by numerical values, $a$ and $b$, respectively. The flag can thus be translated into a matrix, $M$.\n\nThe matrix $M$ will have the following structure:\n*   Most of the matrix consists of the value $a$, representing the red field.\n*   In the upper-left corner, there is a submatrix (the canton) where pixels are mostly $b$ (white), but with a cross-shaped pattern of $a$ (red).\n\n### 2. Simplifying the Rank Calculation\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose $a$ and $b$ to be distinct and non-zero. Let's assume $a \\neq b$, $a \\neq 0$, $b \\neq 0$.\n\nLet the full flag matrix be of size $N \\times M$ and the canton submatrix be of size $h \\times w$. The rows of the matrix $M$ from $h+1$ to $N$ are all identical, consisting only of the value $a$. These rows are linearly dependent and together contribute only 1 to the rank of the matrix.\n\nWe can use row operations to determine the contribution of the first $h$ rows (the rows of the canton). By subtracting a row from the red field (e.g., row $h+1$) from each of the first $h$ rows, we can analyze the canton's contribution to the rank. This operation does not change the rank of the matrix $M$.\n\nLet $C$ be the $h \\times w$ submatrix corresponding to the canton. Its entries are $a$ for the red cross and $b$ for the white background. Let $J$ be an all-ones matrix. The row operations effectively isolate the canton's structure in a new matrix, $A = C - aJ$. The entries of $A$ are:\n*   For red pixels (the cross): $a - a = 0$\n*   For white pixels (the canton background): $b - a$\n\nThe rank of the full flag matrix $M$ is the sum of the rank of this new matrix $A$ and the contribution from the red field, which is 1 (as long as the flag is larger than the canton and $a \\neq 0$).\nSo, **Rank($M$) = Rank($A$) + 1**.\n\nOur problem is now reduced to finding the maximal possible rank of matrix $A$, which has a constant value ($d = b-a$) everywhere except for a cross shape of zeros.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Rank of the Canton Matrix (A)\n\nThe rank of $A$ depends on the number of unique, linearly independent rows it contains. A \"couped Greek cross\" is geometrically the union of two intersecting rectangles, a horizontal one and a vertical one. The shape of the zero-cross in matrix $A$ determines its rank.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of distinct row patterns. The pattern of a given row is defined by the positions of its zeros, which in turn depends on how the row intersects the rectangles forming the cross. We can identify four distinct types of rows in matrix $A$:\n\n1.  **Type 1:** Rows that do not intersect the cross at all. These rows consist entirely of the value $d$.\n2.  **Type 2:** Rows that intersect only the vertical bar of the cross. These rows will have zeros in the columns corresponding to the vertical bar.\n3.  **Type 3:** Rows that intersect only the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows will have zeros in the columns corresponding to the horizontal bar.\n4.  **Type 4:** Rows that intersect both the horizontal and vertical bars of the cross (i.e., the intersection region). These rows will have zeros in all columns covered by either bar.\n\nBy carefully choosing the pixel dimensions of the canton and the rectangles forming the cross, we can ensure that:\n*   The canton is large enough to contain at least one row of each of the four types.\n*   The column intervals of the vertical and horizontal bars partially overlap, which is necessary to make the four resulting row vectors linearly independent.\n\nFor example, we can construct a canton where the horizontal bar of the cross occupies columns 10-20 and the vertical bar occupies columns 15-25. This creates regions of non-overlap, partial overlap, and full overlap, allowing for the four distinct and linearly independent row vectors.\n\nThis construction allows for a matrix $A$ with a rank of 4.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe maximal rank of the matrix $A$ (representing the canton's white background with the red cross as zeros) is 4.\n\nUsing our earlier formula, the maximal rank of the entire flag matrix $M$ is:\nRank($M$) = Rank($A$) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis is the highest possible rank, achieved by designing the pixel layout of the flag to minimize the symmetries and linear dependencies in the resulting matrix.\n\n<<<5>>>"
