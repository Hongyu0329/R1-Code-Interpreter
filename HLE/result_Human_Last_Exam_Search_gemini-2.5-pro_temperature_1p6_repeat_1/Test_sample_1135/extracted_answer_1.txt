In the CCSD method, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are also zero for all triply, quadruply, and any other higher excited Slater determinants. This is because the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H}$, contains at most two-body operators, and therefore, its action on the reference determinant, $|\Phi\rangle$, can only generate states with a maximum of two excitations. Consequently, its projection onto any determinant with three or more excitations is identically zero.
