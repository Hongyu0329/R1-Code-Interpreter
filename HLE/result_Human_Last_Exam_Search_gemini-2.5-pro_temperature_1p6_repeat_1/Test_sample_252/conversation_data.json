    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), a minimum of two diffraction gratings are necessary.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **The Goal:** CTIS aims to capture a three-dimensional (3D) data cube, which contains two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, Î»), in a single snapshot on a two-dimensional (2D) sensor.\n*   **The Method:** The technique works by dispersing the light from the scene onto a detector. This dispersion creates multiple, spectrally smeared images of the scene on the sensor. A tomographic reconstruction algorithm then unscrambles this 2D data to reconstruct the original 3D data cube.\n*   **The Need for 2D Dispersion:** To provide enough information for the tomographic reconstruction of a 2D spatial scene, the spectral information must be spread out in two dimensions. A single one-dimensional grating would only disperse the spectrum along one line. This is insufficient for the algorithm to distinguish between spatial and spectral information from the overlapping images.\n*   **The Solution:** The minimum requirement is to create a two-dimensional diffraction pattern. This is typically achieved by using two crossed one-dimensional diffraction gratings, with their dispersion axes arranged orthogonally to each other. While a single physical component known as a \"2D grating\" or a computer-generated hologram (CGH) can also be used, it functions by having periodic structures in two directions, which is functionally equivalent to two separate gratings.\n\nTherefore, two crossed gratings provide the necessary two-dimensional dispersion required for the tomographic reconstruction of a spectral volume from a single captured image.\n\n<<<B>>>"
