    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, up to conjugacy by the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, is given by the number of conjugacy classes of the corresponding Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nA reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is specified by its type and a Frobenius endomorphism $F$. The $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$. An $F$-conjugacy class is an equivalence class of elements in $W$ under the relation $w \\sim w'$ if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w' = x w F(x)^{-1}$.\n\nThe Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is an inner form of the split group. For such groups, the action of the Frobenius endomorphism on the Weyl group is trivial. Therefore, the $F$-conjugacy classes are the standard conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$. The number of conjugacy classes of a finite group is equal to the number of its irreducible complex representations (or characters). For the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, this number has been computed. The group $W(E_8)$ has 112 absolutely irreducible characters and therefore 112 conjugacy classes.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
