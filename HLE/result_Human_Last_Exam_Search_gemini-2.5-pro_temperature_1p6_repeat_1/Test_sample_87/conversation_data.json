    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Recall the given information-theoretic quantities:**\n*   $I(X;Y)=3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z)=2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y)=5$\n*   $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which implies that $H(W|Z)=0$. This indicates that $Z$ contains all the information that $W$ has.\n\n**2. Use the chain rule for mutual information to find other quantities.**\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$.\nUsing this, we can write:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\nSimilarly, $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\nSubstituting the known values: $8 = I(X;Z) + 2$, which gives $I(X;Z)=6$.\n\n**3. Express the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in terms of knowns.**\nWe can relate information quantities involving $Y$, $W$, and $Z$ using standard identities. A key identity connects mutual information before and after conditioning on a new variable. For any four random variables $A, B, C, D$:\n$I(A;B|C) - I(A;B|C,D) = I(A;D|B,C) - I(A;D|C)$\n\nLet's apply this identity by setting $A=X$, $B=Y$, $C=W$, and $D=Z$:\n$I(X;Y|W) - I(X;Y|W,Z) = I(X;Z|Y,W) - I(X;Z|W)$.\n\nSince $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$), conditioning on $Z$ makes $W$ redundant. Therefore, $I(X;Y|W,Z) = I(X;Y|Z)$.\nSubstituting the given value $I(X;Y|Z)=2$, the equation becomes:\n$I(X;Y|W) - 2 = I(X;Z|Y,W) - I(X;Z|W)$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$ (Eq. 1)\n\n**4. Relate the terms on the right-hand side to known quantities.**\nWe can use the chain rule on the variables being conditioned upon:\n*   Since $W=f(Z)$, the Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ holds. This implies $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$. By the chain rule: $I(X;Z) = I(X;Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$. Thus, $I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W) = 6 - I(X;W)$.\n*   Similarly, the conditional Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W | Y$ holds. This implies $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$. Thus, $I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n**5. Substitute these expressions back into Eq. 1.**\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + (6 - I(X;W)) - (5 - I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ (Eq. 2)\n\nThis important relation expresses the quantity we want to maximize in terms of quantities related to $W$.\n\n**6. Maximize the resulting expression.**\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\nLet's consider two specific choices for the function $f$ to get a feel for possible values:\n*   If $W$ is a constant (e.g., $f(z) = c$ for all $z$), then $W$ is independent of all other variables.\n    *   $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=0$.\n    *   $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 0 - 0 = 3$. So, 3 is a possible value.\n*   If $W=Z$ (e.g., $f(z)=z$), then we are conditioning on $Z$ itself.\n    *   $I(X;W|Y) = I(X;Z|Y) = 5$.\n    *   $I(X;W) = I(X;Z) = 6$.\n    *   $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 6 = 2$. This is consistent with the given $I(X;Y|Z)=2$.\n\nTo see if a value greater than 3 is possible, we can construct a specific model for the random variables that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n**7. Construct a valid model for X, Y, and Z.**\nLet $X_a, X_b, X_c, Y_c, Z_c$ be independent random variables (e.g., blocks of random bits). Let their entropies (amount of information) be $H(X_a)=1$, $H(X_b)=2$, and $H(X_c)=5$. For simplicity, let $Y_c$ and $Z_c$ be empty/constant (zero entropy).\nDefine:\n*   $X = (X_a, X_b, X_c)$\n*   $Y = (X_a, X_b)$\n*   $Z = (X_a, X_c)$\n\nLet's verify that this model meets the given criteria:\n*   $I(X;Y) = I((X_a, X_b, X_c); (X_a, X_b)) = H(X_a, X_b) = H(X_a) + H(X_b) = 1 + 2 = 3$. Correct.\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = I((X_a, X_b, X_c); (X_a, X_b) | (X_a, X_c)) = I(X_b; X_b | X_a, X_c) = H(X_b) = 2$. Correct.\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = I((X_a, X_b, X_c); (X_a, X_c) | (X_a, X_b)) = I(X_c; X_c | X_a, X_b) = H(X_c) = 5$. Correct.\nThe model is consistent with all the given information.\n\n**8. Find the maximum within this model.**\nNow, let's find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$ for this model, where $W=f(Z) = f(X_a, X_c)$.\nFrom Eq. 2, we need to maximize $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n*   $I(X;W) = I((X_a, X_b, X_c); f(X_a, X_c))$. Since $X_b$ is independent of $X_a, X_c$ and $W$, this is $I((X_a, X_c); W)$.\n*   $I(X;W|Y) = I((X_a, X_b, X_c); W | (X_a, X_b)) = I(X_c; W | X_a, X_b) = I(X_c; W | X_a)$ (since $X_c$ is independent of $X_b$).\n\nSo we need to maximize $I(X_c; W | X_a) - I(X_a, X_c; W)$.\nLet's analyze this expression:\n$I(X_c; W|X_a) = H(W|X_a) - H(W|X_a, X_c) = H(W|X_a)$ (since $W=f(X_a, X_c)$).\n$I(X_a, X_c; W) = H(W) - H(W|X_a, X_c) = H(W)$.\nThe expression to maximize becomes $H(W|X_a) - H(W)$.\nThis is equal to $-I(X_a;W)$.\n\nSince mutual information is non-negative, $-I(X_a;W) \\le 0$. The maximum value is 0. This maximum is achieved when $I(X_a;W)=0$, which means $W$ must be independent of $X_a$.\nSince $W=f(X_a, X_c)$ and $X_a$ and $X_c$ are independent, for $W$ to be independent of $X_a$, it must be a function of $X_c$ only.\nSo, let's choose $W=g(X_c)$. For example, $W=X_c$.\n\nLet's check this case: $W=X_c$.\n*   $I(X;W) = I(X;X_c) = H(X_c) = 5$.\n*   $I(X;W|Y) = I(X;X_c|Y) = H(X_c|Y) - H(X_c|X,Y) = H(X_c|Y) - 0$. Since $Y=(X_a,X_b)$ and $X_c$ is independent of them, $H(X_c|Y)=H(X_c)=5$. So $I(X;W|Y)=5$.\n*   Plugging into Eq. 2: $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 5 = 3$.\n\nThe maximum value for $I(X;W|Y)-I(X;W)$ in this model is 0. This leads to a maximum value for $I(X;Y|W)$ of 3. As this model satisfies all initial conditions, and provides a clear upper bound within its structure, it is highly indicative of the general solution.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
