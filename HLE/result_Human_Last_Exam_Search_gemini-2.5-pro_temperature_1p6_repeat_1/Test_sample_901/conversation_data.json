    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product:\n1.  **Reagents**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. This, along with the tert-butyl alcohol solvent, strongly favors an elimination reaction over a substitution reaction. Specifically, these conditions promote the E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism.\n\n2.  **Substrate Stereochemistry**: The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This specific stereochemistry indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are on opposite sides of the cyclohexane ring, meaning they are in a *trans* configuration.\n\n3.  **E2 Reaction Mechanism Requirements**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, the bromine atom) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an anti-periplanar position to each other. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n\n4.  **Conformational Analysis**:\n    *   A *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one where both substituents are in equatorial positions (diequatorial) and another, much less stable conformation, where both are in axial positions (diaxial).\n    *   For the E2 reaction to occur, the bromine atom must be in an axial position. Therefore, the reaction must proceed through the less stable diaxial conformer.\n    *   In this diaxial conformation, let's assume the bromine on carbon 1 is axial and pointing down. The *trans* methyl group on carbon 2 will be axial and pointing up.\n\n5.  **Identifying Possible Products**: There are two types of β-hydrogens that could potentially be removed: one on carbon 2 (which also has the methyl group) and one on carbon 6.\n    *   **Elimination towards Carbon 2 (Zaitsev Product)**: To form the more substituted alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene, a hydrogen from carbon 2 must be removed. In the required diaxial conformation, the methyl group is axial, which means the hydrogen on carbon 2 is equatorial. Since this hydrogen is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, this elimination cannot occur via the E2 mechanism.\n    *   **Elimination towards Carbon 6 (Hofmann Product)**: On carbon 6, there is a hydrogen atom that is in an axial position and is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on carbon 1. A bulky base like potassium tert-butoxide can abstract this accessible axial proton.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: Due to the rigid stereochemical requirements of the E2 reaction, elimination is only possible by removing the anti-periplanar hydrogen from carbon 6. This results in the formation of a double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 6. The resulting product is the less substituted alkene, which is known as the Hofmann product. The formation of the Hofmann product is also favored by the use of a bulky base.\n\nThe name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
