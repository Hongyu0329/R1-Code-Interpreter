The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations is generated by the vector fields `X_1 = ∂/∂t`, `X_2 = ∂/∂x`, and `X_3 = 2t ∂/∂t + x ∂/∂x - (2/k_1)u ∂/∂u`.

The general representation for the transformations on x is given by solving `dx/dε = ξ(x)`, where `ξ(x)` is the coefficient of `∂/∂x` in the infinitesimal generator. The basis for `ξ` is `{1, x}`. The general infinitesimal transformation for `x` is `ξ = c_2 + c_3 x`.

The corresponding finite transformation is found by integrating `dx/dε = c_2 + c_3 x`.

*   For `c_3 ≠ 0`, the transformation is `x*(ε) = (x_0 + c_2/c_3)exp(c_3 ε) - c_2/c_3`.
*   For `c_3 = 0`, the transformation is `x*(ε) = x_0 + c_2 ε`.
