    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclization of `(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)`-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory and the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. These principles predict the stereochemical outcome of the reaction, which in turn determines the ratio of the cis- (A) and trans- (B) isomeric products.\n\n### Analysis using Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory\n\n1.  **Classifying the Reaction**: The reaction is an electrocyclic ring closure of a polyene, deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This polyene possesses eight π-electrons.\n\n2.  **Applying Woodward-Hoffmann Rules**: For an 8π electron system, which fits the general formula of a `4n` π-electron system (where n=2), the Woodward-Hoffmann rules state that the thermal reaction proceeds through a **conrotatory** ring closure. In a conrotatory process, the terminal p-orbitals of the conjugated system rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to form the new sigma bond. The alternative, a disrotatory closure, is considered symmetry-forbidden under thermal conditions for an 8π system.\n\n3.  **Determining the Stereochemical Outcome**: The stereochemistry of the starting material, `(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)`-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, dictates the stereochemistry of the final product.\n    *   The terminal carbons of the π-system are C2 and C9. On C2, the methyl group and the rest of the polyene chain are on the same side due to the Z-configuration of the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   On C9, the methyl group is on the opposite side of the main chain due to the E-configuration of the C8=C9 double bond.\n    *   To visualize the ring closure, imagine the polyene chain curling into a \"U\" shape. The methyl group on C2 points \"out\" of the U, while the methyl group on C9 points \"in\".\n    *   During the predicted conrotatory closure, both terminal groups must rotate in the same direction. This concerted motion forces the two methyl groups to end up on opposite faces of the newly formed eight-membered ring.\n    *   Therefore, the product formed is the *trans*-isomer, `trans`-5,10-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,6-triene (Isomer B). The formation of the cis-isomer would require a disrotatory closure, which is thermally forbidden.\n\n### Conclusion on the Product Ratio\n\nFMO theory predicts that the thermally allowed conrotatory pathway leads exclusively to the formation of the *trans*-isomer (B). The pathway to the *cis*-isomer (A), being thermally forbidden, has a significantly higher activation energy barrier. As a result, the formation of isomer A is highly unfavorable.\n\nWhile FMO theory is a qualitative tool that predicts which reaction pathways are favored, it implies a very high degree of selectivity. The reaction is expected to produce almost exclusively the *trans*-isomer B. Therefore, the ratio of A:B will be very close to 0:100.\n\n<<<The ratio of A:B is predicted to be 0:100.>>>"
