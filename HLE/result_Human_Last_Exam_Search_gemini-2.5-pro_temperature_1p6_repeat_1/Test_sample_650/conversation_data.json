    "The crucial assumption in analyzing this algorithm is how we measure the input size and the cost of the elementary operations.\n\nThe input to the algorithm is the integer `n`. The size of the input is typically considered to be the number of bits needed to represent `n`, which is `b = log₂(n)`.\n\nThe core of the algorithm is the `while` loop, which executes as long as `q > 0`. Let's analyze the number of iterations:\n1.  Initially, `x = n`.\n2.  In the first step, `q` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`.\n3.  In each iteration of the loop, the value of `q` is reduced by a factor of `c`.\n4.  The loop continues until `q` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before the result is less than 1 is `log_c(n)`.\n\nTherefore, the `while` loop runs approximately `log_c(n)` times.\n\nInside the loop, the following operations are performed:\n*   `i := i + 1` (one addition)\n*   `x := q` (one assignment)\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋` (one division)\n*   `a_i := x - qc` (one multiplication and one subtraction)\n\nIf we assume that these basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction) on numbers up to the size of `n` take constant time, then each iteration of the loop takes a constant amount of time.\n\nUnder this assumption, the total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the constant time per iteration.\n*   **Time Complexity** = (Number of iterations) * (Time per iteration)\n*   **Time Complexity** = O(log_c(n)) * O(1)\n*   **Time Complexity** = O(log_c(n))\n\nIn complexity analysis, the base of the logarithm does not affect the overall class, as logarithms of different bases are related by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`), which is absorbed by the Big O notation. Therefore, the complexity can be expressed as O(log n). This is a standard result for this type of algorithm.\n\nIt is important to note that the assumption of constant-time arithmetic operations is valid for numbers that fit within a computer's word size (e.g., 64-bit integers). For arbitrarily large numbers, the cost of the division and multiplication operations would themselves depend on the number of bits in `n`, leading to a higher complexity (e.g., `O((log n)²)`, depending on the multiplication/division algorithm used). However, for the standard analysis of this algorithm with native integer types, the complexity is logarithmic.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
