    "### All-or-Nothing Vaccines: Efficacy Estimation\n\nFor an all-or-nothing vaccine, the formula `1 - incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy. In this vaccine model, a portion of the vaccinated population receives complete immunity, while the remainder receives no protection at all.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key concepts:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine works by conferring perfect protection to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals. The rest of the vaccinated individuals remain as susceptible to infection as those who are unvaccinated. For example, a vaccine with 80% efficacy in an all-or-nothing model would provide 100% protection to 80% of recipients, and 0% protection to the other 20%.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is calculated by dividing the incidence rate of the disease in the vaccinated group by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n*   **Vaccine Efficacy (VE) from Incidence Rate:** A common formula to calculate vaccine efficacy is `VE = 1 - IRR`.\n*   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy:** This measures the reduction in the probability of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen.\n\nIn an all-or-nothing scenario, the group of vaccinated individuals who are not protected will contract the disease at the same rate as the unvaccinated group when exposed. The fully protected group will not get sick. Therefore, the overall reduction in the incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group directly reflects the proportion of individuals who were fully protected. This proportion is equivalent to the per-exposure efficacy, because for any given exposure, a vaccinated individual either has 100% protection or 0% protection. The average of this protection across the group is equal to the percentage of people who are fully protected.\n\nThus, the value calculated from `1 - IRR` accurately represents the per-exposure efficacy for this specific type of vaccine. It has been noted that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, measuring efficacy through cumulative incidence (1 â€“ risk ratio) provides a stable measure of the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are protected.\n\n<<<C>>>"
