    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we first need to determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces. The connectivity of a pointed space $X$, denoted $\\text{conn}(X)$, is the largest integer $k$ such that $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i \\le k$.\n\n### 1. Connectivity of the Spaces\n\n*   **Spheres:** An $n$-sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected for $n \\ge 1$.\n    *   $S^4$ is 3-connected.\n    *   $S^6$ is 5-connected.\n\n*   **Loop Spaces:** For a $k$-connected space $X$ with $k \\ge 1$, the loop space $\\Omega X$ is $(k-1)$-connected.\n    *   $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) = \\text{conn}(S^4) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n    *   $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) = \\text{conn}(S^6) - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4$.\n\n*   **Smash Products:** For connected CW complexes $X$ and $Y$, the connectivity of their smash product satisfies $\\text{conn}(X \\wedge Y) \\ge \\text{conn}(X) + \\text{conn}(Y) + 1$.\n    *   $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\ge \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) + \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) + 1 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7$.\n\n*   **Suspension:** For a connected space $Z$, the connectivity of its suspension is $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma Z) = \\text{conn}(Z) + 1$.\n    *   The source space is $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Its connectivity is $\\text{conn}(A) \\ge 7 + 1 = 8$.\n\n*   **Target Space:** The target space is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since the smash product of spheres $S^m \\wedge S^n$ is homeomorphic to $S^{m+n}$, we have $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\cong S^{10}$.\n    *   The target space is $B \\cong \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n    *   Therefore, $\\text{conn}(B) = \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\text{conn}(S^{10}) - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8$.\n\nBoth the source and target spaces are 8-connected. This means that for any map $f: A \\to B$, the induced map on homotopy groups $\\pi_i(f)$ is an isomorphism for $i < 8$ (as both groups are trivial) and is a map between trivial groups for $i=8$.\n\n### 2. Connectivity of the Map\n\nA map $f: A \\to B$ is said to be $k$-connected if its homotopy fiber $F_f$ is $(k-1)$-connected. This is equivalent to $\\pi_i(f)$ being an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\nFrom the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration $F_f \\to A \\to B$:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_i(A) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_i(f)} \\pi_i(B) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(F_f) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(A) \\to \\dots $$\n\nSince both $A$ and $B$ are 8-connected, $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ and $\\pi_i(B) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$. From the long exact sequence, we have `... \\to 0 \\to 0 \\to \\pi_{i-1}(F_f) \\to 0 \\to ...` for $i \\le 8$. This implies $\\pi_j(F_f) = 0$ for $j \\le 7$. So the fiber $F_f$ is at least 7-connected, and the map $f$ is at least 8-connected.\n\nTo determine if the map is 9-connected, we examine the sequence at $i=9$:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_9(A) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_9(f)} \\pi_9(B) \\to \\pi_8(F_f) \\to \\pi_8(A) \\to \\dots $$\nSince $A$ is 8-connected, $\\pi_8(A)=0$. The sequence becomes:\n$$ \\pi_9(A) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_9(f)} \\pi_9(B) \\to \\pi_8(F_f) \\to 0 $$\nThis implies that $\\pi_8(F_f)$ is the cokernel of $\\pi_9(f)$. The map $f$ is 9-connected if and only if $\\pi_8(F_f) = 0$, which means $\\pi_9(f)$ must be surjective.\n\nLet's compute the 9th homotopy groups of the source and target:\n*   $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) = \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    The space $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected. By the Hurewicz theorem, $\\pi_8(Z) \\cong H_8(Z)$. Using the KÃ¼nneth formula and the known homology of loop spaces of spheres (`H_k(\\Omega S^{2n}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}` for $k$ being a multiple of $2n-1$ and 0 otherwise in a range), we find that $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Thus, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo, $\\pi_9(f)$ is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. Such a map is surjective if and only if it is an isomorphism (multiplication by $\\pm 1$). The specific map described as \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" refers to a canonical construction, which in this context is a generalization of the Whitehead product. Such canonical maps are known to induce an isomorphism on the lowest-dimensional non-trivial homotopy groups. Therefore, it is standard to assume that $\\pi_9(f)$ is an isomorphism. With this assumption, its cokernel $\\pi_8(F_f)$ is trivial, and the map is 9-connected.\n\nTo determine if the map is 10-connected, we need to check if $\\pi_9(F_f) = 0$. Let's look at the long exact sequence:\n$$ \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B) \\to \\pi_9(F_f) \\to \\pi_9(A) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_9(f)} \\pi_9(B) $$\nAssuming $\\pi_9(f)$ is an isomorphism, the kernel of $\\pi_9(f)$ is trivial, so the image of the map $\\pi_9(F_f) \\to \\pi_9(A)$ must be zero. This leads to the short exact sequence:\n$$ 0 \\to \\pi_{10}(B) \\to \\pi_9(F_f) \\to 0 $$\nThis implies $\\pi_9(F_f) \\cong \\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. From tables of homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_{11}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nSince $\\pi_9(F_f) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\neq 0$, the homotopy fiber $F_f$ is not 9-connected. Thus, the map is not 10-connected.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
