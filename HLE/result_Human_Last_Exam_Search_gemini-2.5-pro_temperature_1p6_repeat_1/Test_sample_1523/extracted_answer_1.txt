In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the quadratic part of the Euclidean action. This is expressed as:

`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x  ϕ(x) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(x)`

where:
*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.
*   `τ` is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to `β`.
*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.
*   The operator `D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.
