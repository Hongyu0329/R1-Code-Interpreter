    "In the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` at a finite temperature `T`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` corresponds to the quadratic part of the Euclidean action in the exponent. The partition function `Z` is expressed as a path integral over all field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time `τ` with a period `β = 1/T`.\n\nThe partition function is given by:\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`\n\nHere, `Dϕ` represents the functional measure, and `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action for the scalar field. For a neutral scalar field with mass `m` and a potential `V(ϕ)`, the Euclidean Lagrangian density `L_E` is obtained by performing a Wick rotation to imaginary time (`t → -iτ`). This results in a change of the Minkowski metric `(+, -, -, -)` to a Euclidean metric `(+, +, +, +)`. The Euclidean action is then:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x [ 1/2 (∂_τ ϕ)² + 1/2 (∇ϕ)² + 1/2 m²ϕ² + V(ϕ) ]`\n\nThe term `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the context of the functional integral typically refers to the part of the action that is quadratic in the fields, which determines the propagator of the theory. By expressing the quadratic part of the action in a bilinear form, we can identify the operator `D_ϕ`.\n\nFor the free theory (or the quadratic part of an interacting theory), the action is:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = 1/2 ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(x) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(x)`\n\nThis expression defines the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`. Therefore, the operator `D_ϕ` is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space:\n\n`D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\nAnd the inner product is given by:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(x) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(x)`\n\nThis formulation is central to calculations in finite-temperature field theory, where the periodicity in imaginary time leads to the discretization of the energy component of momentum into Matsubara frequencies (`ω_n = 2πnT` for bosons).\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the quadratic part of the Euclidean action. This is expressed as:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x  ϕ(x) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(x)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.\n*   `τ` is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to `β`.\n*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n*   The operator `D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.>>>"
