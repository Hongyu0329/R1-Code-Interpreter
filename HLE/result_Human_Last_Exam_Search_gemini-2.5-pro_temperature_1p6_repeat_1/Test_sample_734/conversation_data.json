    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology that can describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nIn a sermon on the birth of Christ, Augustine directly addressed the miraculous nature of the virgin birth by stating, \"**Naturae jura mutantur in homine**\" which translates to \"**The laws of nature are changed in the case of man**.\" This demonstrates his use of specific language to articulate a divine alteration of the natural order for a particular salvific purpose. In the same sermon, he links this event to humanity's need for a savior due to the guilt of sin, thus connecting it to the consequences of the Fall.\n\nAugustine's extensive writings on the Fall of Man in works like *City of God* and *On the Literal Meaning of Genesis* detail a fundamental shift in the state of human nature and the natural world. Before the Fall, humanity existed in a state of harmony with nature, and human bodies were not subject to decay or disordered passions. Augustine argued that after Adam and Eve's sin, human nature became corrupted, a state characterized by concupiscence (disordered desire), disease, and mortalityâ€”a judicial punishment from God that altered the way human bodies and nature itself functioned.\n\nWhile he may not have used the precise phrase \"Naturae jura mutantur\" in his direct discussions of the Fall, his theological framework makes the terminology applicable to both events. For Augustine, God, the author of nature, can alter the \"laws of nature\" he established. This concept is demonstrated:\n*   **Miraculously in the virgin birth**, where the normal law of human reproduction was set aside for the Incarnation.\n*   **Judicially in the consequences of the Fall**, where the state of human nature and its relationship with the natural world were fundamentally changed, introducing suffering and death where there was none before.\n\nThus, Augustine of Hippo stands as the primary theologian who developed a specific terminology and a coherent theological framework for understanding that the \"laws of nature\" could be altered by divine action, a principle that he applied to the virgin birth and which is intrinsically applicable to his doctrine of the Fall's impact on creation.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
