    "The radius of a circle that tightly packs fourteen circles of radius one is approximately 3.896.\n\nFor the densest packing of 14 equal circles into a larger circle, the ratio of the radius of the large circle (R) to the radius of the small circles (r) has been studied and proven to be optimal. Given that the radius of the smaller circles is one, the radius of the enclosing circle is the value of this ratio.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive table of the best-known packings of equal circles in a circle, the radius of the larger circle for 14 smaller circles is approximately 3.896328994747926. Rounding this value to four significant digits gives 3.896.\n\n<<<3.896>>>"
