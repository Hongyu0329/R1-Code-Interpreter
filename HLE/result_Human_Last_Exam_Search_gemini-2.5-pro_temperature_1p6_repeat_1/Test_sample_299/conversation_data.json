    "To determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, we will first analyze the properties of such functions and then establish their existence and quantity.\n\n### Properties of the function $f$\n\n1.  **Injectivity**: Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. The given equation implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotone. Thus, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Continuity**: The function $f$ is required to be continuous. The composition of two continuous functions is continuous, and since $\\exp(x)$ is continuous, this is a consistent requirement.\n\n### Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing\n\nIf $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, as $\\exp(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of $f$ at infinity. As a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is an open interval $(L, M)$ where $L = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ and $M = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$. These limits can be finite or infinite.\n\nLet's consider the limits of the composition $f(f(x))$:\n*   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $\\exp(x) \\to 0$.\n    For the composition, as $x \\to -\\infty$, $y=f(x) \\to M$. So, we must have $\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y) = 0$. Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, for the limit to be $0$, the argument $y$ must approach $+\\infty$. Therefore, $M = +\\infty$. This means $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n\n*   As $x \\to \\infty$, $\\exp(x) \\to \\infty$.\n    For the composition, as $x \\to \\infty$, $y=f(x) \\to L$. So, we must have $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = \\infty$. Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, for the limit to be $+\\infty$, the argument $y$ must approach $-\\infty$. Therefore, $L = -\\infty$. This means $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n\nSo, if a strictly decreasing solution exists, it must be a homeomorphism from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet's re-check the limits with this information:\n*   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $y = f(x) \\to +\\infty$. Then $f(f(x)) = f(y) \\to \\lim_{y \\to \\infty} f(y) = L = -\\infty$.\n*   However, we need $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to -\\infty$.\n\nThis leads to the contradiction $-\\infty = 0$. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ satisfying the given equation.\n\n### Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing\n\nIf $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent.\n\n*   **Fixed Points**: If $f$ had a fixed point, say $f(x_0)=x_0$, then $f(f(x_0))=f(x_0)=x_0$. This would mean $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. However, the function $g(x)=\\exp(x)-x$ has a global minimum at $x=0$, where $g(0)=1$. Thus, $\\exp(x)>x$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, and there are no fixed points. Consequently, $f$ cannot have any fixed points.\n*   For a strictly increasing function with no fixed points, we must have either $f(x)>x$ for all $x$ or $f(x)<x$ for all $x$.\n    *   If $f(x)<x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$.\n    *   If $f(x)>x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) > f(x) > x$.\n    Since $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ and $\\exp(x)>x$, the case $f(x)<x$ is impossible. Thus, any solution must satisfy $f(x)>x$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe existence of such functions, known as functional square roots of the exponential function, is a classic problem in functional equations. It can be shown that such functions not only exist but are abundant.\n\n### Construction and Cardinality\n\nSolutions to $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ can be constructed via conjugation. This involves finding a homeomorphism $\\alpha: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that simplifies the function $\\exp(x)$. Let's try to conjugate $\\exp(x)$ to a simple translation, $T_{1}(t) = t+1$. We seek an invertible function $\\alpha$ such that:\n$$ \\alpha(\\exp(x)) = \\alpha(x) + 1 $$\nThis is Abel's functional equation. Under mild conditions, continuous, strictly increasing solutions $\\alpha$ exist. Let's assume we have such a solution $\\alpha_0$.\n\nWe can then define the \"half-iterate\" of the translation: $T_{1/2}(t) = t + 1/2$.\nA solution $f$ can then be constructed by conjugating back:\n$$ f(x) = \\alpha^{-1}(T_{1/2}(\\alpha(x))) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x) + 1/2) $$\nLet's verify this:\n$f(f(x)) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(\\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1/2)) + 1/2) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1/2+1/2) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nThe crucial point is that the solution to Abel's equation is not unique. If $\\alpha_0(x)$ is a solution, then for any function $p(t)$ which is continuous, has period 1 (i.e., $p(t+1)=p(t)$), and for which $\\phi(t) = t + p(t)$ is a strictly increasing function, the function $\\alpha(x) = \\phi(\\alpha_0(x))$ is also a solution:\n$$ \\alpha(\\exp x) = \\phi(\\alpha_0(\\exp x)) = \\phi(\\alpha_0(x)+1) $$\nWe need $\\phi(t+1) = \\phi(t)+1$. Let $p(t) = \\phi(t) - t$. Then $p(t+1) = \\phi(t+1) - (t+1) = \\phi(t)+1 - t - 1 = p(t)$, so $p$ must be periodic with period 1.\nAn updated construction for $\\alpha$ is $\\alpha(x) = \\alpha_0(x) + p(\\alpha_0(x))$, where $p$ is any continuous periodic function with period 1 such that $\\alpha$ remains strictly increasing.\n\nThe set of such periodic functions $p(t)$ is uncountably infinite. For instance, for any small enough constant $c$, the function $p(t) = c \\sin(2\\pi t)$ will yield a valid strictly increasing $\\alpha$. One can construct a vast number of distinct periodic functions (e.g., using Fourier series with different coefficients) that satisfy the conditions.\n\nEach of these distinct choices for $\\alpha$ generates a different function $f$. This construction alone suggests there are at least as many solutions as there are suitable periodic functions, which is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. This is because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense countable subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, such as the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The number of such functions is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince the set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$. Combined with the fact that we have constructed a family of solutions with cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, we can conclude that the cardinality of the set is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Are there decreasing solutions? No.\n*   Are there increasing solutions? Yes.\n*   How many? A continuum's worth.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n"
