    "The island town that is more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island and sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name is **Hanga Roa**.\n\nHanga Roa is the main town and capital of Easter Island, a Chilean territory. Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, with its nearest inhabited neighbor, Pitcairn Island, located over 1,900 kilometers away, and the coast of Chile about 3,540 kilometers to the east. This satisfies the distance requirement.\n\nThe town is situated on the island's west coast, nestled in a lowland area between the extinct volcanoes of Maunga Terevaka and Rano Kau. The town's name, Hanga Roa, translates to \"Long Bay\" or \"Wide Bay\" in the Rapa Nui language, and it is located on a bay of the same name. Easter Island itself is of volcanic origin, formed by three main volcanoes. The large, impressive crater of the Rano Kau volcano is located right next to Hanga Roa. While the town is not inside the caldera, it sits on a bay on the flank of this large volcanic structure.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
