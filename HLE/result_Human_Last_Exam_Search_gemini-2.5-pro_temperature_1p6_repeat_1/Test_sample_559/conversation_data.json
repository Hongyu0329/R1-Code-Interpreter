    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first need to identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The separatrices are the curves in the phase plane that separate regions of different qualitative behavior, and they are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane on the upper half plane, where $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe set the derivatives to zero to find the equilibrium points $(d, u)$:\n$u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values of $u$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nSo, the equilibrium points in the upper half-plane are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**2. Stability Analysis of Equilibrium Points**\n\nTo determine the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0, \\lambda_2 = 0$. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point, and its stability cannot be determined by linearization.\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & -3(0) + 10(0)(1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the point **(0, 1) is an unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & -3(-1) + 10(-1)(1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, the point **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix of the system is formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1).\n\n*   **Stable Manifold of (-1, 1):**\n    The stable manifold corresponds to the negative eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1 = -2$. The eigenvector $(v_1, v_2)$ is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_1 I)v = 0$:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 - (-2) & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - (-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives $-6v_2 = 0$ and $3v_2 = 0$, so $v_2 = 0$. The vector is of the form $(v_1, 0)$, and we can choose the eigenvector to be **(1, 0)**.\n    The stable manifold is tangent to the line with this direction vector passing through (-1, 1). This is the horizontal line $u=1$.\n    To determine which part of the line $u=1$ constitutes the stable manifold, we analyze the flow on this line. When $u=1$, $u'(t) = 0$, so trajectories starting on this line stay on it. The equation for $d$ becomes $d'(t) = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1)$. For trajectories to approach $d=-1$, we need $d<0$. For $-1<d<0$, $d'<0$, so $d$ decreases towards -1. For $d<-1$, $d'>0$, so $d$ increases towards -1.\n    Therefore, the stable manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1) is the half-line **u = 1, d < 0**. This line segment separates trajectories that are repelled upwards from the line $u=1$ from those repelled downwards.\n\n*   **Unstable Manifold of (-1, 1):**\n    The unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2 = 1$. The eigenvector is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_2 I)v = 0$:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 - 1 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives $-3v_1 - 6v_2 = 0$, which simplifies to $v_1 = -2v_2$. We can choose the eigenvector to be **(-2, 1)**.\n    The unstable manifold consists of two curves that are tangent to the direction vector (-2, 1) at the saddle point (-1, 1). These curves separate the phase plane into regions with different long-term behaviors. One branch of this manifold enters the region $u>1$, and the other enters the region $0<u<1$.\n\nThe separatrix of the system is the union of these stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1).\n\n<<<The separatrix of the system is composed of the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at (-1, 1). The stable manifold is the half-line defined by $u=1$ for $d<0$. The unstable manifold consists of two curves that are tangent to the vector $(-2, 1)$ at the point $(-1, 1)$.>>>"
