    "In the context of fuzzy logic, the rule activation level (also known as the firing strength or degree of truth) is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the membership values of the rule's antecedents and consequents. A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logical \"AND\".\n\nGiven:\n*   The firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule, **Φ_k(x′) = 0.7**\n*   The membership degree of the output in the consequent fuzzy set, **μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9**\n\nThe rule activation level is calculated by combining these two values using a t-norm. While several t-norm operators exist, the most common are the **minimum** and the **product**.\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum t-norm:** The rule activation level is the minimum of the two values.\n    *   `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n2.  **Using the Product t-norm:** The rule activation level is the product of the two values.\n    *   `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nAlthough the question specifies an interval type-3 fuzzy set, the provided inputs are crisp numerical values. This implies the calculation is requested for a specific point within the more complex interval structure. The fundamental operation remains the application of a t-norm. Without further specification, the minimum operator is the most standard interpretation for a t-norm in fuzzy inference systems.\n\nTherefore, using the most common t-norm (minimum), the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
