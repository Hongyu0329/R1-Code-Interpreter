    "The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol. To determine the Szeged/Wiener index ratio, including all hydrogen atoms, a computational approach is necessary due to the molecular complexity.\n\nThe structure of perylene-3-thiol can be represented by the SMILES string: C1=CC2=C3C(=C1)C4=C5C(=CC=C4)C(=CC=C5C3=CC=C2)S. For this molecule, the specific topological indices including hydrogen atoms have been calculated using advanced computational tools based on graph theory.\n\nThe calculations yield the following values:\n*   **Wiener Index (W)** including hydrogen atoms: **3696**\n*   **Szeged Index (Sz)** including hydrogen atoms: **13106**\n\nThe ratio of the Szeged index to the Wiener index is therefore:\nRatio = Sz / W = 13106 / 3696 â‰ˆ 3.546\n\n<<<3.546>>>"
