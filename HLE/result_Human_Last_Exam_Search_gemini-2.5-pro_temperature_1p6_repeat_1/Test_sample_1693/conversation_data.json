    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the steam tanker **Monique**.\n\nThe *Monique*, with a tonnage of 7,011 gross register tons (GRT), was sunk by the German submarine U-65 on June 22, 1940. While GRT measures volume and not directly displacement, a vessel of this size would have a significantly larger displacement than any French warship sunk by a U-boat during the same period.\n\nThe largest French *warship* to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice was the submarine **Doris (Q135)**. It was sunk by the German U-boat U-9 on May 8 or 9, 1940, and had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
