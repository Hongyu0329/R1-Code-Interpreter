    "Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO‚ÇÇ) nanoparticles are effective catalysts for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting, but the ideal nickel-to-cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio for maximizing catalytic performance differs significantly for each application. The optimal ratio is also influenced by the presence of other dopants and the specific reaction conditions.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, a relatively low Ni content is generally favored. Research indicates that an optimal nickel proportion is around **7% molar** in lanthanum-doped ceria (La-CeO‚ÇÇ) catalysts for the reverse WGS reaction. Studies on catalysts without additional dopants have shown high carbon monoxide (CO) conversion with Ni loadings ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt% on CeO‚ÇÇ. One study, in particular, achieved a CO conversion of 97.8% with a **12.5 wt% Ni/CeO‚ÇÇ** catalyst. Another study reported high activity with **5 wt% Ni** on gadolinium-doped ceria. These findings suggest that a lower concentration of well-dispersed nickel on the ceria support is sufficient for high catalytic activity in the WGS reaction.\n\n### Water Splitting\n\nIn contrast, a significantly higher nickel content is beneficial for water splitting, which consists of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).\n\nFor the **oxygen evolution reaction (OER)**, studies on Niùë¶Ce‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ-ùë¶Oùë• electrocatalysts have identified that formulations of **Ni‚Çá‚ÇÖCe‚ÇÇ‚ÇÖOùë• (a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 3:1)** and **Ni‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄCe‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄOùë• (a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 1:1)** exhibit the highest catalytic activities. The enhanced performance at these higher nickel concentrations is attributed to a larger number of active sites and favorable electronic properties. A computational study further supports this, suggesting a **3:1 Ni/Ce ratio** provides a more favorable adsorption energy for the water-splitting reaction.\n\nFor the **hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)**, a **1:1 molar ratio of Ni to ceria** in a Ni/ceria-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite has been shown to provide excellent catalytic activity. Furthermore, in catalysts where ceria is co-doped with nickel and iron, a high total dopant concentration of 20 mol% (with a 1:1 ratio of Ni to Fe) has demonstrated superior bifunctional performance for both HER and OER. This indicates that the interplay between nickel and other co-dopants is crucial.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is application-specific:\n\n*   For the **Water Gas Shift reaction**, a lower Ni content, in the range of **5 to 12.5 wt%** or a **molar ratio of approximately 0.07**, is generally optimal.\n*   For **water splitting**, a higher Ni content is preferred, with an ideal **Ni/Ce molar ratio ranging from 1:1 to 3:1**.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is approximately 5-12.5 wt% for the Water Gas Shift reaction and a molar ratio of 1:1 to 3:1 for water splitting.>>>"
