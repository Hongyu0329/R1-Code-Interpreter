    "A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed by connecting two complete graphs of 5 nodes each with a single edge, known as the bottleneck edge. In randomized uniform gossiping, a node is chosen uniformly at random and then selects a neighbor uniformly at random to communicate with.\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge can be calculated as follows:\n\n**Graph Structure:**\n*   A 10-node barbell graph consists of two K5 cliques (complete graphs with 5 nodes each).\n*   Let the nodes in the first clique be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and in the second clique be {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n*   The bottleneck edge connects the two cliques, for instance, between node 5 and node 6.\n\n**Node Degrees:**\n*   In each K5 clique, a node is connected to 4 other nodes.\n*   The nodes not connected to the bottleneck edge (nodes 1-4 and 7-10) have a degree of 4. There are 8 such nodes.\n*   The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge (nodes 5 and 6) are each connected to 4 nodes in their own clique and 1 node in the other clique. Therefore, their degree is 5.\n\n**Gossip Algorithm and Probability Calculation:**\nThe process of \"sampling an edge\" in randomized uniform gossiping is assumed to be a two-step process:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from all N nodes (in this case, N=10). The probability of selecting any specific node *u* is 1/10.\n2.  The selected node *u* then chooses one of its neighbors *v* uniformly at random. The probability of this is 1/degree(*u*).\n\nThe bottleneck edge (5, 6) can be sampled in two ways:\n1.  **Node 5 is selected and communicates with node 6:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node 5 is 1/10.\n    *   The probability of node 5 choosing to communicate with node 6 is 1/degree(5) = 1/5.\n    *   The total probability for this event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\n2.  **Node 6 is selected and communicates with node 5:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node 6 is 1/10.\n    *   The probability of node 6 choosing to communicate with node 5 is 1/degree(6) = 1/5.\n    *   The total probability for this event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events, the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of their probabilities:\nP(sampling bottleneck) = P(5 → 6) + P(6 → 5) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nTherefore, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25 or 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
