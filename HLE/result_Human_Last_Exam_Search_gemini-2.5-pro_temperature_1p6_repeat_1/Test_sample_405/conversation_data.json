    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least seven distinct colors: white, yellow, red, violet, scarlet, black, and blue. These colors correspond to the different structural arrangements of phosphorus atoms.\n\nThe primary and most well-known allotropes of phosphorus are white, red, and black.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** In its pure form, it is a white, waxy solid. However, it often appears as a pale yellow solid due to exposure to light and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope has a characteristic deep red or dark red color. It can also be described as having a violet-red appearance or an iron-grey luster.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** As the name suggests, this allotrope is black with a metallic sheen, resembling graphite. It exists in two crystalline forms, alpha-black and beta-black phosphorus, both of which are black in color.\n\nBeyond these common forms, other allotropes contribute to the color diversity of phosphorus:\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline form is distinctly violet or red-purple.\n\n*   **Scarlet Phosphorus:** This allotrope appears as a scarlet-colored powder and is considered a transitional form between other allotropes.\n\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** A more recently discovered two-dimensional allotrope, blue phosphorus adds another hue to the element's palette.\n\nAdditionally, other described forms include fibrous red phosphorus and red/brown phosphorus nanorods, further illustrating the range of reddish hues. Gaseous diphosphorus (P2) is another allotrope, but it typically exists at very high temperatures and is not associated with an observable color under normal conditions.\n\n<<<7>>>"
