    "A finite group G is called a filled group if all of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fill the group. A product-free set is a subset where no element is the product of two others (not necessarily distinct) from the set. A product-free set fills the group if every non-identity element is either in the set or is a product of two elements from the set.\n\nThe finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the cyclic groups of order 3 (C₃), the cyclic groups of order 5 (C₅), and the 2-groups (groups whose order is a power of 2).\n\nThis classification can be broken down as follows:\n*   **Abelian Nilpotent Groups:** A finite abelian group is a filled group if and only if it is C₃, C₅, or an elementary abelian 2-group (isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of order 2). Since all abelian groups are nilpotent, these are part of the classification.\n*   **Non-Abelian Nilpotent Groups:** For a non-abelian nilpotent group to be filled, it must be a 2-group. This includes certain well-known families of groups. For example:\n    *   The only filled dihedral 2-groups are the dihedral group of order 4 (D₄, which is isomorphic to the elementary abelian group C₂ × C₂) and the dihedral group of order 8 (D₈).\n    *   No generalized quaternion group is filled.\n\nIn summary, the complete list of finite filled nilpotent groups consists of C₃, C₅, and all finite 2-groups.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if it is a cyclic group of order 3, a cyclic group of order 5, or a 2-group.>>>"
