    "### Brain Regions Posterior to the Palliovisceral Lobe in Dwarf Cuttlefish Identified\n\nIn the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions situated directly posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**. This anatomical arrangement is detailed in the 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a component of the larger palliovisceral lobe complex, which is part of the subesophageal mass of the cuttlefish brain. This complex governs lower motor control related to locomotion, such as escape movements and ink ejection. The subesophageal mass, located ventral to the esophagus, also includes motor centers for the arms and tentacles and regions controlling visceral functions.\n\nThe comprehensive brain atlas for the dwarf cuttlefish, developed by Montague et al. and accessible through the interactive web tool \"Cuttlebase,\" provides a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain's 32 to 38 lobes. Visualizations from this atlas, particularly posterior views of the brain, clearly show the spatial relationships between these lobes. The posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass, which are crucial for the cuttlefish's remarkable camouflage abilities. The fin lobes are involved in the movement of the fins. The entire posterior portion of the cuttlefish brain is encased in cranial cartilage for protection.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe complex itself also contains the lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes, which are in close proximity to the palliovisceral lobe. However, based on the posterior views provided in the brain atlas, the most direct posterior neighbors to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes."
