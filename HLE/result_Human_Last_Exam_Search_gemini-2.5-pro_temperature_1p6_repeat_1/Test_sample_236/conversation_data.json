    "An integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings can represent infinitely many elements of the homology cobordism group.\n\nThe knots with a crossing number of four or less are the unknot (0 crossings), the trefoil knot (3 crossings), and the figure-eight knot (4 crossings).\n\nAn integral surgery on a knot involves cutting out a tubular neighborhood of the knot and sewing it back in a different way, specified by an integer. This process creates a new 3-dimensional manifold. When this procedure is applied to a knot in the 3-sphere, the resulting manifold is an integral homology 3-sphere. The homology cobordism group is a group of these integral homology 3-spheres, where two are considered equivalent if they form the boundary of a 4-dimensional manifold with certain properties.\n\nLet's consider the simplest case: the unknot. An integral surgery on the unknot with an integer coefficient *p* results in a lens space denoted as L(p, 1). Two such lens spaces, L(p, 1) and L(q, 1), are homology cobordant if and only if the absolute values of *p* and *q* are equal. Since *p* can be any integer, we can generate an infinite number of distinct homology cobordism classes from surgeries on the unknot alone. For example, L(1,1) is the 3-sphere, which represents the trivial element of the group, while L(p,1) for |p| > 1 gives non-trivial elements.\n\nIntegral surgeries on the trefoil knot and the figure-eight knot also produce elements of the homology cobordism group. For instance, it is a known result in topology that certain surgeries on the trefoil knot, such as the Brieskorn sphere Î£(2,3,5) (obtained by -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil), have infinite order in the homology cobordism group. Furthermore, for a given knot K, the manifolds obtained by 1/n-surgery are often linearly independent in the homology cobordism group for different values of n.\n\nSince surgery on just the unknot already provides an infinite number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, the total number of representable elements by knots with at most four crossings is infinite.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
