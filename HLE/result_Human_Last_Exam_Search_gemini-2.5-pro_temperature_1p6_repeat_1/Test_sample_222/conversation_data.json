    "To find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the given sequence, we first need to determine the original 4-point sequences, x(n) and h(n), from their DFTs, X(k) and H(k). Then, we will construct the new 8-point sequence and determine the most appropriate method to find a 4-point DFT as requested.\n\n### Step 1: Find the inverse DFT of X(k) and H(k)\n\nThe Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is given by the formula:\n`s(n) = (1/N) * Σ[k=0 to N-1] S(k) * exp(j * 2 * π * n * k / N)`\n\n**For sequence x(n):**\nGiven `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`, the 4-point IDFT is calculated as:\n`x(n) = (1/4) * Σ[k=0 to 3] X(k) * exp(j * 2 * π * n * k / 4)`\n\n*   `x(0) = (1/4) * [X(0) + X(1) + X(2) + X(3)] = (1/4) * [1 + j - 1 - j] = 0`\n*   `x(1) = (1/4) * [X(0) + j*X(1) - 1*X(2) - j*X(3)] = (1/4) * [1 + j(j) - (-1) - j(-j)] = (1/4) * [1 - 1 + 1 - 1] = 0`\n*   `x(2) = (1/4) * [X(0) - X(1) + X(2) - X(3)] = (1/4) * [1 - (j) + (-1) - (-j)] = (1/4) * [1 - j - 1 + j] = 0`\n*   `x(3) = (1/4) * [X(0) - j*X(1) - X(2) + j*X(3)] = (1/4) * [1 - j(j) - (-1) + j(-j)] = (1/4) * [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 1`\n\nSo, the sequence `x(n)` is `{0, 0, 0, 1}`.\n\n**For sequence h(n):**\nGiven `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`, the 4-point IDFT is:\n`h(n) = (1/4) * Σ[k=0 to 3] H(k) * exp(j * 2 * π * n * k / 4)`\n\n*   `h(0) = (1/4) * [H(0) + H(1) + H(2) + H(3)] = (1/4) * [0 + (1+j) + 1 + (1-j)] = 3/4`\n*   `h(1) = (1/4) * [H(0) + j*H(1) - H(2) - j*H(3)] = (1/4) * [0 + j(1+j) - 1 - j(1-j)] = (1/4) * [j-1 - 1 - j-1] = -3/4`\n*   `h(2) = (1/4) * [H(0) - H(1) + H(2) - H(3)] = (1/4) * [0 - (1+j) + 1 - (1-j)] = (1/4) * [-1-j + 1 -1+j] = -1/4`\n*   `h(3) = (1/4) * [H(0) - j*H(1) - H(2) + j*H(3)] = (1/4) * [0 - j(1+j) - 1 + j(1-j)] = (1/4) * [1-j - 1 + j+1] = 1/4`\n\nSo, the sequence `h(n)` is `{0.75, -0.75, -0.25, 0.25}`.\n\n### Step 2: Construct the new sequence\n\nThe problem asks for the DFT of the sequence `{x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. Let's call this 8-point sequence `y(n)`.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n`y(n) = {0, 0.75, 0, -0.75, 0, -0.25, 1, 0.25}`\n\n### Step 3: Finding the 4-point DFT\n\nThe request for a 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence implies a process of \"decimation-in-frequency\". This means we should first form a 4-point sequence `z(n)` by aliasing the 8-point sequence `y(n)` in time. This is done by adding the second half of `y(n)` to its first half:\n`z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n*   `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2) = 0 + 0 = 0`\n*   `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2) = 0.75 + (-0.25) = 0.5`\n*   `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3) = 0 + 1 = 1`\n*   `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3) = -0.75 + 0.25 = -0.5`\n\nSo, the 4-point sequence for which we need to compute the DFT is `z(n) = {0, 0.5, 1, -0.5}`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the 4-point DFT of z(n)\n\nThe 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is calculated as:\n`Z(k) = Σ[n=0 to 3] z(n) * exp(-j * 2 * π * n * k / 4)`\n\n*   `Z(0) = z(0) + z(1) + z(2) + z(3) = 0 + 0.5 + 1 - 0.5 = 1`\n*   `Z(1) = z(0) - j*z(1) - z(2) + j*z(3) = 0 - j(0.5) - 1 + j(-0.5) = -1 - j`\n*   `Z(2) = z(0) - z(1) + z(2) - z(3) = 0 - 0.5 + 1 - (-0.5) = 1`\n*   `Z(3) = z(0) + j*z(1) - z(2) - j*z(3) = 0 + j(0.5) - 1 - j(-0.5) = -1 + j`\n\nAlternatively, this result can be obtained from a property of the DFT that relates the DFT of `z(n)` to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. The 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence `y(n)` is given by `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + exp(-j*π*k/4) * H(k mod 4)`. The 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is then `Z(k) = Y(2k)`.\n\n`Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0) + H(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n`Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2) + exp(-j*π/2) * H(2) = -1 - j*1 = -1 - j`\n`Z(2) = Y(4) = X(0) + exp(-j*π) * H(0) = 1 - 1*0 = 1`\n`Z(3) = Y(6) = X(2) + exp(-j*3π/2) * H(2) = -1 + j*1 = -1 + j`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe 4-point DFT of the sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}` is **[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]**.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
