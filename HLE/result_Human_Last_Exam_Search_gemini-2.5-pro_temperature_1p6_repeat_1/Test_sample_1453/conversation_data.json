    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify its heptad repeat pattern and then apply the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing based on the identity of the amino acids at the core positions.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled-coil proteins feature a repeating seven-amino-acid sequence known as a heptad repeat, designated by the letters `abcdefg`. The stability of the coiled-coil structure is primarily driven by hydrophobic interactions between residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions, which form the hydrophobic core. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), and Alanine (A).\n\nThe given sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nTo determine the heptad frame, we look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues spaced correctly to be at the 'a' and 'd' positions (i and i+3). A consistent assignment can be made by aligning the sequence as follows:\n\n<pre>\nSequence:  G E <b>I</b> A Q S <b>L</b> K E <b>I</b> A K S <b>L</b> K E <b>I</b> A W S <b>L</b> K E <b>I</b> A Q S <b>L</b> K G\nPosition:  b c <b>d</b> e f g <b>a</b> b c <b>d</b> e f g <b>a</b> b c <b>d</b> e f g <b>a</b> b c <b>d</b> e f g <b>a</b> b\n</pre>\n\nThis alignment reveals a highly regular pattern for the core positions:\n*   **'a' positions are consistently occupied by Leucine (L)** (at residues 7, 14, 21, 28).\n*   **'d' positions are consistently occupied by Isoleucine (I)** (at residues 3, 10, 17, 24).\n\nThe four identified heptad repeats are: `LKEIAQS`, `LKEIAKS`, `LKEIAWS`, and `LKEIAQS`. In each case, the pattern is `a=L` and `d=I`.\n\n### 2. Applying Knobs-into-Holes Packing Rules\n\nThe specific identity and arrangement of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions dictate the packing geometry and, consequently, the oligomeric state of the coiled coil. Landmark studies, particularly on the GCN4 leucine zipper, established a set of rules based on the packing efficiency of different hydrophobic side chains.\n\nThe key rules are as follows:\n*   When the **'a' positions have Isoleucine (I)** and the **'d' positions have Leucine (L)**, the coiled-coil preferentially forms a **dimer (2 helices)**.\n*   When both the **'a' and 'd' positions have Isoleucine (I)**, the structure tends to be a **trimer (3 helices)**.\n*   When the **'a' positions have Leucine (L)** and the **'d' positions have Isoleucine (I)**, a **tetramer (4 helices)** is formed.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nBased on our analysis of the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, the core 'a' positions are occupied by Leucine and the 'd' positions by Isoleucine. According to the established principles of knobs-into-holes packing, this specific arrangement favors the formation of a tetramer. Therefore, the oligomeric state would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
