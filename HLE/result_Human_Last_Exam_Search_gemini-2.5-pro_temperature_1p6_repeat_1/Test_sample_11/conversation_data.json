    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law, 5733-1973. This law marked a significant shift in Israeli jurisprudence, which had previously been aligned with English common law that does not have a general, explicit requirement of good faith.\n\nThe principle of good faith was imported from continental legal systems, particularly German law. The statute introduces this concept in two key sections:\n*   **Section 12** mandates that parties in negotiation for a contract must act in a customary manner and in good faith.\n*   **Section 39** requires that any right or obligation arising from a contract be exercised or fulfilled in good faith.\n\nThe introduction of this principle was considered the most significant innovation of the law, applying not only to the performance of a contract but also to the pre-contractual negotiation stage. Over time, Israeli courts have broadly interpreted and applied the duty of good faith, extending its influence beyond contract law to all areas of private law.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
