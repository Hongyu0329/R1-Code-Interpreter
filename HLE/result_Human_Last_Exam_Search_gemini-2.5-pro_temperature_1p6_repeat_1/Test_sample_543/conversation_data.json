    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide results in the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene. The IUPAC name for this product is **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n\nThis transformation occurs via a series of Grignard cross-coupling reactions. In such reactions with polyhalogenated aromatic compounds, the reactivity of the halogens typically follows the order I > Br > Cl > F. The carbon-iodine bond is the most susceptible to reaction, followed by the carbon-bromine bonds.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in the following steps:\n1.  **First Substitution:** The iodine atom at the 2-position of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene is the most reactive site. One equivalent of phenyl magnesium bromide replaces the iodine atom to form 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  **Second and Third Substitutions:** Since phenyl magnesium bromide is used in excess, it will then react with the two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. Two more equivalents of the Grignard reagent will substitute these bromine atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe final product, after an aqueous work-up to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent, is a central benzene ring substituted with three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. While reactions involving Grignard reagents and aryl halides can sometimes proceed through aryne intermediates, the stepwise substitution of the halogens based on their reactivity is the most direct pathway in this case, leading to the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
