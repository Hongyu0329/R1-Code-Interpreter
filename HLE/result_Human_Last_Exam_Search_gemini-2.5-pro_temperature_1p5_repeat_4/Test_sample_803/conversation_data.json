    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also \"fills\" G. A product-free set S is a subset of G such that the equation `ab = c` has no solution with `a, b, c` in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A set S fills G if every non-identity element of G is either in S or in the set of products `SS = {st | s, t âˆˆ S}`.\n\nBased on the classification of filled groups, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, can be determined. The investigation into filled groups, particularly nonabelian ones, builds upon the foundational work of Street and Whitehead, who classified abelian filled groups.\n\nThe classification for the specific order `2q^m` can be broken down into cases based on the value of `m`.\n\n### Case 1: m = 1\n\nFor `m=1`, the order of the group is `2q`, where `q` is an odd prime. A nonabelian group of this order is isomorphic to the dihedral group `D_2q`. The classification of filled dihedral groups shows that:\n\n*   **The dihedral group `D_10` (of order 2*5) is a filled group.**\n*   **The dihedral group `D_2q` is filled if `q=3` (i.e., `D_6`).**\n*   For `q > 5`, the dihedral group `D_2q` is not filled.\n\n### Case 2: m > 1\n\nFor `m > 1`, we consider nonabelian groups of order `2q^m`. A significant result in the study of filled groups is that a finite `p`-group, where `p` is an odd prime, is filled if and only if it is the cyclic group `C_3` or `C_5`. This result for odd order `p`-groups is a key component.\n\nA more general result concerning filled nilpotent groups is that a finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if `G` is one of the following:\n*   An elementary abelian 2-group.\n*   `C_3`\n*   `C_5`\n*   The dihedral group `D_10`.\n\nA nonabelian group of order `2q^m` has a normal Sylow `q`-subgroup, which we can denote as `Q`. The group is a semidirect product of `Q` and a cyclic group of order 2, `C_2`. If the group is nilpotent, it must be the direct product `Q x C_2`. Since `q` is an odd prime, `Q` is an odd order `p`-group (with `p=q`). For the direct product to be filled, `Q` would have to be `C_3` or `C_5`. However, the direct products `C_3 x C_2` (isomorphic to `C_6`) and `C_5 x C_2` (isomorphic to `C_10`) are abelian. Therefore, there are no nonabelian nilpotent filled groups of this form.\n\nIf the group is not nilpotent, the semidirect product is non-trivial. Research by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart provides a detailed classification of filled groups. They show that for an odd prime `p`, a nonabelian group of order `2^n p` is filled only in a few specific cases. In the context of the question, `n=1` and `p=q^m`. The existing classifications do not point to any nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for `m > 1`.\n\nCombining these findings, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are:\n\n*   The dihedral group `D_6` (order 2*3).\n*   The dihedral group `D_10` (order 2*5).\n\nThese are the only such groups identified in the classification of filled groups.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the dihedral group `D_6` (where `q=3, m=1`) and the dihedral group `D_10` (where `q=5, m=1`).>>>"
