    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n### 2. Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nA primitive Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ can be uniquely written as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi_i$ with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$\nwhere the conductors of the component characters are:\n*   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_1) = 2^2 = 4$\n*   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_2) = 3^2 = 9$\n*   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_3) = 7$\n*   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_4) = 11$\n*   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_5) = 13$\n\n### 3. Determine the Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$\nWe are looking for characters where this lcm is equal to 6.\n\n### 4. Find the Possible Orders for Each Component Character\nLet's determine the number and possible orders of primitive characters for each conductor. The group of Dirichlet characters modulo $q$ is of order $\\phi(q)$. For a prime $p$, this group is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: There is only one primitive character modulo 4. Its order is 2. So, for $\\chi_1$, the order is fixed at 2. There is 1 choice for $\\chi_1$.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 9(1 - 1/3) = 6$. The characters which are not primitive are those induced from modulo 3, and their orders are divisors of $\\phi(3)=2$. Therefore, the primitive characters modulo 9 must have orders that divide 6 but not 2, which are 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So, for $\\chi_2$, the order must be 3 or 6. There are $2+2=4$ choices for $\\chi_2$.\n\n*   **Conductor 7**: The group of characters modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. The possible orders are the divisors of 6 greater than 1, which are 2, 3, and 6.\n\n*   **Conductor 11**: The group of characters modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The possible orders for primitive characters are divisors of 10 greater than 1, which are 2, 5, and 10.\n\n*   **Conductor 13**: The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The possible orders for primitive characters are divisors of 12 greater than 1, i.e., 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\n### 5. Combine the Conditions\nFor the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_i$ must divide 6.\n2.  The least common multiple of the orders must be exactly 6.\n\nLet's check the first condition. We count the number of choices for each $\\chi_i$ such that its order divides 6:\n*   $\\chi_1$ (cond=4): The order is 2, which divides 6. We have 1 choice.\n*   $\\chi_2$ (cond=9): The orders are 3 or 6, both divide 6. We have 4 choices.\n*   $\\chi_3$ (cond=7): The orders can be 2, 3, or 6. All divide 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. We have 5 choices.\n*   $\\chi_4$ (cond=11): The possible orders are 2, 5, 10. The only order that divides 6 is 2. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) = 1$. We have 1 choice.\n*   $\\chi_5$ (cond=13): The possible orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Those dividing 6 are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. We have 5 choices.\n\nThe total number of combinations of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, ..., \\chi_5)$ where each has an order dividing 6 is the product of the number of choices for each:\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, let's check the second condition. For any of these 100 combinations, is the order of $\\chi$ exactly 6?\nThe order of $\\chi$ is $L = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\n*   Since $\\text{ord}(\\chi_1)=2$, the lcm must be a multiple of 2.\n*   The order of $\\chi_2$ must be 3 or 6, both of which are multiples of 3. Thus, the lcm must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the order $L$ is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. As we have already established that the order of each component divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6. A number that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, every single one of the 100 possible characters has an order of exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
