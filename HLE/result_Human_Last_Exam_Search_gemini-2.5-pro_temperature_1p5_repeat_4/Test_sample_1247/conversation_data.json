    "To determine \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions.\n\nLet \\(\\sigma\\) be a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\). The number of inversions in \\(\\sigma\\) is the number of pairs \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\sigma_i > \\sigma_j\\). A permutation \\(\\sigma\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\sigma_i < \\sigma_k < \\sigma_j < \\sigma_l\\).\n\nWe can determine \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) by considering the position of the largest element, \\(n\\). Let \\(\\sigma_j = n\\).\nThe presence of \\(n\\) at position \\(j\\) creates \\(n-j\\) inversions, since \\(n\\) is larger than all the other \\(n-1\\) elements. All these inversions involve \\(n\\).\nThe total number of inversions in \\(\\sigma\\) is \\(k\\). Thus, the number of inversions among the elements other than \\(n\\) must be \\(k - (n-j)\\). Let \\(\\sigma'\\) be the permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n-1\\}\\) obtained by removing \\(n\\) from \\(\\sigma\\) and relabeling. The number of inversions in \\(\\sigma'\\) must be \\(k-(n-j)\\).\n\nFor \\(\\sigma\\) to avoid the pattern 1324, certain conditions must be met by \\(\\sigma'\\). A 1324 pattern is \\(\\sigma_i < \\sigma_k < \\sigma_j < \\sigma_l\\) for \\(i<j<k<l\\).\nIf \\(n\\) is part of such a pattern, it must be the largest element, so \\(\\sigma_l = n\\). This means \\(l=j\\), so \\(\\sigma_j=n\\).\nThe pattern would be \\(\\sigma_i < \\sigma_k < \\sigma_j < n\\), with \\(i<j<k\\). This is not the right index order. The pattern has indices \\(i<j<k<l\\).\nLet's see which role \\(n\\) can play in \\(\\sigma_i < \\sigma_k < \\sigma_j < \\sigma_l\\). It must be \\(\\sigma_l=n\\). This requires \\(l\\) to be the position of \\(n\\), so \\(j\\) in our notation should be \\(l\\). So \\(\\sigma_l = n\\).\nThe condition becomes: there exist indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\sigma_i < \\sigma_k < \\sigma_j < n\\).\nThis implies that the sub-permutation \\(\\sigma'\\) must not contain a 132-like pattern \\(\\sigma'_i < \\sigma'_k < \\sigma'_j\\) for \\(i<j<k\\).\nIf \\(n\\) is not part of the pattern, then the pattern must exist entirely within \\(\\sigma'\\).\n\nSo, for \\(\\sigma\\) to be 1324-avoiding, the sub-permutation \\(\\sigma'\\) must avoid both the 1324 pattern and the 132 pattern. It is known that any permutation that avoids the 132 pattern also avoids the 1324 pattern. Therefore, the condition simplifies: \\(\\sigma'\\) must be a 132-avoiding permutation.\n\nIn our problem, \\(n=333\\) and \\(k=3\\). Let \\(\\sigma_j=333\\). The number of inversions due to 333 is \\(333-j\\). This must be less than or equal to 3.\n\\(333-j \\le 3 \\implies j \\ge 330\\).\nSo, the element 333 can be in position 330, 331, 332, or 333.\n\n1.  **Case 1: \\(\\sigma_{333} = 333\\)**\n    Number of inversions from 333 is \\(333-333=0\\). \\(\\sigma'\\) (a permutation of length 332) must have \\(3-0=3\\) inversions and be 132-avoiding. The count is \\(av_{332}^3(132)\\).\n\n2.  **Case 2: \\(\\sigma_{332} = 333\\)**\n    Number of inversions from 333 is \\(333-332=1\\). \\(\\sigma'\\) must have \\(3-1=2\\) inversions and be 132-avoiding. The count is \\(av_{332}^2(132)\\).\n\n3.  **Case 3: \\(\\sigma_{331} = 333\\)**\n    Number of inversions from 333 is \\(333-331=2\\). \\(\\sigma'\\) must have \\(3-2=1\\) inversion and be 132-avoiding. The count is \\(av_{332}^1(132)\\).\n\n4.  **Case 4: \\(\\sigma_{330} = 333\\)**\n    Number of inversions from 333 is \\(333-330=3\\). \\(\\sigma'\\) must have \\(3-3=0\\) inversions and be 132-avoiding. The count is \\(av_{332}^0(132)\\).\n\nSumming these cases, we get:\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = av_{332}^3(132) + av_{332}^2(132) + av_{332}^1(132) + av_{332}^0(132)\\)\n\nNow we need to find the number of 132-avoiding permutations with a given number of inversions. A known result in combinatorics states that the number of 132-avoiding permutations of length \\(m\\) with \\(j\\) inversions, \\(av_m^j(132)\\), is equal to the number of partitions of the integer \\(j\\), denoted \\(p(j)\\), provided that \\(m \\ge j\\). In our cases, \\(m=332\\) and \\(j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\). The condition \\(332 \\ge 3\\) is clearly met.\n\nWe need the number of partitions for \\(j=0, 1, 2, 3\\):\n*   \\(p(0) = 1\\) (the only partition is the empty one).\n*   \\(p(1) = 1\\) (the only partition is 1).\n*   \\(p(2) = 2\\) (the partitions are 2 and 1+1).\n*   \\(p(3) = 3\\) (the partitions are 3, 2+1, and 1+1+1).\n\nSo we have:\n*   \\(av_{332}^0(132) = p(0) = 1\\).\n*   \\(av_{332}^1(132) = p(1) = 1\\).\n*   \\(av_{332}^2(132) = p(2) = 2\\).\n*   \\(av_{332}^3(132) = p(3) = 3\\).\n\nAdding these numbers together:\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7\\).\n\n<<<7>>>"
