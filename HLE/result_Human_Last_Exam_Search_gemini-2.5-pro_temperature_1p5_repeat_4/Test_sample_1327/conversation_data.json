    "The initial analysis of the differences and simple multiplicative patterns did not reveal the logic. The search results, while not containing the exact sequence in most cases, provide examples of different kinds of number sequence patterns.\n\nLet's re-examine the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\nI will try to find a relationship based on multiplication and addition/subtraction, as this is a common pattern.\n\nLet's test the pattern: next number = (previous number * 2) + something.\n2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n51 * 2 + 17 = 119\nThe numbers being added are 7, 1, 5, 17. There isn't an obvious pattern here.\n\nLet's test the pattern: next number = (previous number * 3) - something.\n2 * 3 - (-5) = 11 (doesn't make sense)\nLet's try: next number = (previous number * `a`) +/- `b`\n\nLet's reconsider the multiplication pattern and look for a pattern in the multiplier itself.\n2 * `x` ≈ 11 -> x ≈ 5.5\n11 * `y` ≈ 23 -> y ≈ 2.1\n23 * `z` ≈ 51 -> z ≈ 2.2\n51 * `w` ≈ 119 -> w ≈ 2.3\nIt seems the multiplier is getting slightly larger than 2.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's express the numbers in relation to powers of 2.\n2 = 2^1\n11 ≈ 2^3 = 8 or 2^4 = 16\n23 ≈ 2^4 = 16\n51 ≈ 2^5 = 32 or 2^6 = 64\n119 ≈ 2^7 = 128\n\nLet's try to form a pattern of the form `a*n^k + ...`.\nThis seems too complex.\n\nLet's reconsider the first pattern `y = 2x + a`, but let's look at the differences of the added numbers.\nAdded numbers: 7, 1, 5, 17.\nDifferences: 1 - 7 = -6\n5 - 1 = 4\n17 - 5 = 12\nStill not a clear pattern.\n\nLet's try one more time with `y = 2x + k`.\n2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n11 = 2*2 + 7\n23 = 2*11 + 1\n51 = 2*23 + 5\n119 = 2*51 + 17\n\nWait, I think I see a different pattern:\n11 = 5 * 2 + 1\n23 = 11 * 2 + 1\n51 = 23 * 2 + 5 (this breaks the pattern)\n\nLet's try:\n2 * 5 + 1 = 11\n11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n23 * 2 + 5 = 51 (The added number changed)\n51 * 2 + 17 = 119 (The added number changed again)\n\nLet's try another approach based on multiplication and subtraction.\n2 * 6 - 1 = 11\n11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n23 * 2 + 5 = 51\nThis is not consistent.\n\nLet's re-examine the differences.\n11 - 2 = 9\n23 - 11 = 12\n51 - 23 = 28\n119 - 51 = 68\n\nDifferences of the differences (second differences):\n12 - 9 = 3\n28 - 12 = 16\n68 - 28 = 40\nStill not a simple arithmetic progression.\n\nLet's look for an online sequence solver or a similar sequence. I'll search for parts of the sequence. The search results show many different types of sequence patterns, which suggests trying various standard forms. One common pattern is `a(n) = c * a(n-1) + k`. Another is looking at the differences between terms.\n\nLet's reconsider my initial attempts and analyze them more carefully.\nSequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n\nLet's try the relation `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + k_n`.\na_2 = 2*a_1 + k_2 => 11 = 2*2 + 7\na_3 = 2*a_2 + k_3 => 23 = 2*11 + 1\na_4 = 2*a_3 + k_4 => 51 = 2*23 + 5\na_5 = 2*a_4 + k_5 => 119 = 2*51 + 17\nk = {7, 1, 5, 17}. Still no obvious pattern.\n\nLet's try a relation with prime numbers as one search result suggested something similar.\nPrimes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...\n2\n3*3 + 2 = 11\n5*5 - 2 = 23\n7*7 + 2 = 51\n11*11 - 2 = 119\n\nThis looks like a consistent pattern!\nLet `p_n` be the nth prime number starting from p_1 = 2.\nThe sequence `x_n` is:\np_1 = 2 -> `x_1` = 2\np_2 = 3 -> `x_2` = p_2^2 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11\np_3 = 5 -> `x_3` = p_3^2 - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23\np_4 = 7 -> `x_4` = p_4^2 + 2 = 49 + 2 = 51\np_5 = 11 -> `x_5` = p_5^2 - 2 = 121 - 2 = 119\n\nThe pattern seems to be `x_n = (p_n)^2 +/- 2`, alternating starting with plus. The first term does not follow this rule, but the subsequent terms do. However, the question might have a simpler underlying logic.\n\nLet's try another pattern. Maybe there is a simpler relation that I am missing.\nx(1) = 2\nx(2) = 11 = 2*x(1) + 7\nx(3) = 23 = 2*x(2) + 1\nx(4) = 51 = 2*x(3) + 5\nx(5) = 119 = 2*x(4) + 17\nThe sequence of additions is 7, 1, 5, 17. No obvious rule.\n\nLet's go back to the drawing board.\nSequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, (x)\n\nMaybe the pattern is related to `y = ax + b` where `a` also changes.\n11 = 2 * 4 + 3\n23 = 11 * 2 + 1\n51 = 23 * 2 + 5\n119 = 51 * 2 + 17\nThis is the same dead end as before.\n\nWhat if the first term is an exception? Let's check from the second term.\n11\n23 = 11*2 + 1\n51 = 23*2 + 5\n119 = 51*2 + 17\nThis still leads to the sequence {1, 5, 17}. No obvious pattern here.\n\nLet me try to think outside the box.\nThe numbers are: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\nLet's express them using powers of 2.\n2 = 2^1\n11 = 2^3 + 3\n23 = 2^4 + 7\n51 = 2^5 + 19\n119 = 2^6 + 55\nThe sequence of additions {3, 7, 19, 55} doesn't look simple.\n\nLet's try to express them as `2*n^2 + ...` or `3*n^2 + ...`\nLet n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...\nn=1: 2\nn=2: 11\nn=3: 23\nn=4: 51\nn=5: 119\n\nLet's assume the formula is `a_n = a_{n-1}*2 + k` but k follows a pattern.\nLet's try `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + (-1)^n * c`\n11 = 2*2 + 7\n23 = 2*11 + 1 (Here k=1)\n51 = 2*23 + 5 (Here k=5)\nThis doesn't seem to work.\n\nLet me retry the first pattern I found, maybe I made a mistake.\nDifferences:\n11 - 2 = 9\n23 - 11 = 12\n51 - 23 = 28\n119 - 51 = 68\nDifferences: 9, 12, 28, 68\n\nDifferences of differences (2nd order):\n12 - 9 = 3\n28 - 12 = 16\n68 - 28 = 40\nDifferences: 3, 16, 40\n\nDifferences of differences of differences (3rd order):\n16 - 3 = 13\n40 - 16 = 24\nDifferences: 13, 24\n\nDifference of 4th order:\n24 - 13 = 11\n\nThe differences are not constant, so it's not a simple polynomial.\n\nLet's reconsider `a_n = 2*a_{n-1} + k`\nThe added numbers were {7, 1, 5, 17}\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and the second term is 5, not 11. 2, 5, 11, 23... is a known pattern `2*n+1`. But that is not the question.\n\nWhat if the pattern is `a_n = 2*a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}`?\na3 = 2*11 + 2 = 24 (close to 23)\na4 = 2*23 + 11 = 57 (not 51)\nSo this is not it.\n\nLet's try `y = 2x - k`\n11 = 2 * 2 - (-7)\n23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n... no\n\nLet's try `y = 3x - k`\n11 = 3*2 + 5\n23 = 3*11 - 10\n51 = 3*23 - 18\n119 = 3*51 - 34\nThe subtracted numbers are -5, 10, 18, 34. Let's look at the differences:\n10 - (-5) = 15, no\n10, 18, 34\n18-10 = 8\n34-18 = 16\nThe difference is doubling! So the next difference should be 32.\nThe next subtracted number would be 34 + 32 = 66.\nSo the next term in the main sequence would be:\n`119 * 3 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`\n\nLet's verify this pattern.\nTerm 1: 2\nTerm 2: 3 * 2 + 5 = 11 (Let's say we subtract -5)\nTerm 3: 3 * 11 - 10 = 23 (subtracted number is 10)\nTerm 4: 3 * 23 - 18 = 69 - 18 = 51 (subtracted number is 18)\nTerm 5: 3 * 51 - 34 = 153 - 34 = 119 (subtracted number is 34)\n\nSo the sequence of subtracted numbers is k = {-5, 10, 18, 34}\nLet's find the pattern for k.\nk_1 = -5\nk_2 = 10\nk_3 = 18\nk_4 = 34\nDifferences between k:\nk_2 - k_1 = 15\nk_3 - k_2 = 8\nk_4 - k_3 = 16\nThis doesn't seem to work because of the first term.\n\nLet's restart the logic on `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - k_n`\nx_2 = 3 * x_1 - k_2  => 11 = 3*2 - k_2  => k_2 = -5\nx_3 = 3 * x_2 - k_3  => 23 = 3*11 - k_3 => k_3 = 33 - 23 = 10\nx_4 = 3 * x_3 - k_4  => 51 = 3*23 - k_4 => k_4 = 69 - 51 = 18\nx_5 = 3 * x_4 - k_5  => 119 = 3*51 - k_5 => k_5 = 153 - 119 = 34\nThe sequence of k is: `k = {-5, 10, 18, 34, ...}`\nLet's look at the differences of `k`, ignoring the first term for a moment:\n18 - 10 = 8\n34 - 18 = 16\nThe differences are doubling: 8, 16. The next difference should be 32.\nSo, k_6 = 34 + 32 = 66.\nThen, `x_6 = 3 * x_5 - k_6 = 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\nThis looks like a plausible pattern.\n\nLet's re-examine my initial analysis. I dismissed patterns too quickly.\nThe logic holds from the third term onwards for the differences of 'k'. It's common for the first one or two terms in a sequence to be seeds that don't fit the general rule perfectly.\n\nSo the pattern is defined as:\nx_1 = 2\nx_2 = 11\nThe rest of the terms are generated by the rule: `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - k_n` for n >= 3\nwhere `k_n` is a sequence starting with `k_3 = 10`.\nThe differences in the `k` sequence, `d_n = k_{n+1} - k_n` for n >= 3, follow a geometric progression: `d_3 = 8, d_4 = 16, d_5 = 32, ...`\n`d_n = 2^(n-1) * 4` for `n>=4` -> `d_4 = 2^3 * 4 = 32`. No.\nLet's just stick to the simpler `d_n = 2 * d_{n-1}`\n`d_3 = 8`\n`d_4 = 16`\nThe next difference is `d_5 = 32`.\n`k_6 = k_5 + d_5 = 34 + 32 = 66`.\n`x_6 = 3 * x_5 - k_6 = 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\n\nThis gives answer A. Let's see if there is another simpler pattern.\n\nHow about `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} +/- c`\na3 = 2*11 + 2 = 24.  23 = 24 - 1\na4 = 2*23 + 11 = 57. 51 = 57 - 6\na5 = 2*51 + 23 = 125. 119 = 125 - 6\nThe subtracted part is {1, 6, 6}. No obvious pattern.\n\nLet's stick with the pattern `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - k_n`.\nx_1 = 2\nx_2 = 11\nx_3 = 3 * 11 - 10 = 23\nx_4 = 3 * 23 - 18 = 51\nx_5 = 3 * 51 - 34 = 119\nx_6 = 3 * 119 - 66 = 291\n\nSequence of subtrahends `k_n` (for n >= 3): 10, 18, 34, 66\nDifferences: `d_n`: 8, 16, 32. This is a geometric progression `8 * 2^(n-3)`.\nThis seems like a solid, albeit complex, pattern. The options are A. 291, B. 285, C. 171, D. 167.\nMy derived answer, 291, matches option A.\n\nLet's do a final check to see if there is any other possibility.\nMaybe the pattern is related to something simpler that I missed.\n2, 11, 23, 51, 119\nThe last digits are 2, 1, 3, 1, 9. No simple pattern.\nThe numbers are alternating between roughly `20*k` and `50*k`. No.\n\nI'm confident in the pattern I found: `x_n = 3x_{n-1} - k_n` where the difference of `k_n` doubles each time.\nLet me double check the calculation.\nx_1 = 2\nx_2 = 11\nk_3 = 3*11 - 23 = 10\nk_4 = 3*23 - 51 = 18\nk_5 = 3*51 - 119 = 34\nDifferences of k:\nd_3 = 18 - 10 = 8\nd_4 = 34 - 18 = 16\nThe next difference `d_5` should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\nThe next k, `k_6`, should be `k_5 + d_5 = 34 + 32 = 66`.\nThe next term `x_6` should be `3 * x_5 - k_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`.\n3 * 119 = 3 * (120 - 1) = 360 - 3 = 357.\n357 - 66 = 291.\nThe calculation is correct. The pattern is consistent, even if a bit complex. The existence of the answer in the options gives me confidence.\n\nThe pattern can be summarized as follows:\nThe sequence is given by `x_1=2`, `x_2=11`.\nFor `n > 2`, the `n-th` term is given by `x_n = 3*x_{n-1} - (10 + 8*(2^(n-3)-1) + 2^(n-3)*(n-3 > 0))`. This is getting too complicated.\n\nLet's stick to the recursive definition which is easier to grasp.\nLet a_n be the nth term.\na_1 = 2\na_2 = 11\na_3 = 23 = 3*a_2 - 10\na_4 = 51 = 3*a_3 - 18\na_5 = 119 = 3*a_4 - 34\nLet b_n = 3*a_{n-1} - a_n for n > 2.\nb_3 = 3*11 - 23 = 10\nb_4 = 3*23 - 51 = 18\nb_5 = 3*51 - 119 = 34\nLet's find the next term b_6.\nThe sequence of b is 10, 18, 34.\nThe differences are 18-10=8, 34-18=16. The next difference is 16*2=32.\nSo b_6 = 34 + 32 = 66.\nThen a_6 = 3*a_5 - b_6 = 3*119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291.\n\nFinal conclusion remains the same. The next number is 291.\n\nThe solution is consistent and the result is one of the options.\nFinal check of all steps and calculations.\nSequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\nLet the next term be x.\nPattern: Multiply by 3 and subtract a number.\n3 * 2 = 6. 11 = 6 + 5.\n3 * 11 = 33. 23 = 33 - 10.\n3 * 23 = 69. 51 = 69 - 18.\n3 * 51 = 153. 119 = 153 - 34.\nThe sequence of numbers added/subtracted is: +5, -10, -18, -34. Let's call this sequence `k_n`.\n`k = {+5, -10, -18, -34}`. Let's find a pattern here.\nLet's look at the differences of the absolute values `|k| = {5, 10, 18, 34}`\n10 - 5 = 5\n18 - 10 = 8\n34 - 18 = 16\nThe differences {5, 8, 16} are not as clear as the previous {8, 16}.\n\nThe first operation (+5) seems to break the pattern of \"subtracting\". My previous assumption that the rule `x_n = 3x_{n-1} - k_n` starts from n=3 seems more robust.\n\nLet's assume the pattern starts from the first term.\n`x_n = a * x_{n-1} + b`\nThis doesn't work.\n\nLet's assume `x_n = x_{n-1} * a + f(n)` where `f(n)` is some function.\nLet's try a = 2.\n`x_n = 2x_{n-1} + f(n)`\nf(2) = 11 - 2*2 = 7\nf(3) = 23 - 2*11 = 1\nf(4) = 51 - 2*23 = 5\nf(5) = 119 - 2*51 = 17\nf = {7, 1, 5, 17}. No obvious pattern.\n\nLet's try a = 3.\n`x_n = 3x_{n-1} + f(n)`\nf(2) = 11 - 3*2 = 5\nf(3) = 23 - 3*11 = -10\nf(4) = 51 - 3*23 = -18\nf(5) = 119 - 3*51 = -34\nf = {5, -10, -18, -34}.\nLet's analyze the sequence `g_n = -f(n)` for `n>2`. So `g = {10, 18, 34}`\nDifferences in g: 18-10 = 8, 34-18 = 16.\nNext difference is 32.\nSo `g_5 = 34 + 32 = 66`. This implies `f(6) = -66`.\n`x_6 = 3*x_5 + f(6) = 3*119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\n\nThis pattern seems very consistent from n=3 onwards. The first operation f(2)=5 does not fit the pattern of the subsequent subtractions, which is a common feature in such puzzles. The core logic for the progression of the sequence is sound.\n\nThe next term in the sequence `g` is `34 + 16*2 = 66`.\nThe next term `x` is `3*119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\nThe answer is A.To find the number that should fill the parentheses in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ), we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\nLet's denote the terms of the sequence as `x_1, x_2, x_3, ...`.\n*   `x_1 = 2`\n*   `x_2 = 11`\n*   `x_3 = 23`\n*   `x_4 = 51`\n*   `x_5 = 119`\n\nLet's examine the relationship between consecutive terms. A common type of pattern involves multiplying the previous term by a constant and then adding or subtracting another number. Let's try multiplying by 3.\n*   To get from 2 to 11: `3 * 2 + 5 = 11`\n*   To get from 11 to 23: `3 * 11 - 10 = 23`\n*   To get from 23 to 51: `3 * 23 - 18 = 69 - 18 = 51`\n*   To get from 51 to 119: `3 * 51 - 34 = 153 - 34 = 119`\n\nThe pattern seems to be `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - k_n` (for n > 2), where the number being subtracted follows its own pattern. Let's look at the sequence of subtracted numbers: 10, 18, 34.\n*   The difference between 18 and 10 is 8.\n*   The difference between 34 and 18 is 16.\n\nThe differences between the subtracted numbers are doubling (8, 16, ...). The next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\nTherefore, the next number to be subtracted is `34 + 32 = 66`.\n\nNow, we can find the next term in the main sequence:\nNext Term = `3 * 119 - 66`\n`3 * 119 = 357`\n`357 - 66 = 291`\n\nSo, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
