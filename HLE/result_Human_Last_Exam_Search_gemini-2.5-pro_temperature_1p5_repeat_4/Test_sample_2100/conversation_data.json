    "Andrei Voznesensky was referring to Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nThe Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky immortalized the story of the diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov in his renowned rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\" The libretto contains the line in question, reflecting the long-standing mystery of Rezanov's final resting place.\n\nRezanov, a key figure in the Russian-American Company, undertook a diplomatic mission that included a stop in Spanish California in 1806. There, he fell in love with Concepci처n Arg체ello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco. He traveled back toward Russia to seek the Tsar's permission to marry her but fell ill and died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in March 1807.\n\nFor over a century, the exact location of his grave was unknown. It was marked by a stone monument that eventually deteriorated. However, a renewed interest in his story, fueled in part by Voznesensky's work, led to the rediscovery and confirmation of his grave's location in Krasnoyarsk in the late 1980s. In 2000, in a symbolic ceremony, earth from his grave was taken to the grave of Concepci처n Arg체ello in Benicia, California.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
