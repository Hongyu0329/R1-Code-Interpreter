    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall, is **Francis Turretin**.\n\nThe 17th-century Reformed scholastic theologian Francis Turretin (1623-1687) formulated a specific framework for understanding events that seem to contravene the laws of nature. He distinguished between truths \"in philosophy\" (referring to the natural order) and truths \"in theology\" (referring to God's supernatural power).\n\nTurretin argued that these two realms are not contradictory because they operate under different relations. He used this framework to explain miracles like the virgin birth. In his *Institutes of Elenctic Theology*, he states, \"it is true in philosophy that a virgin cannot bring forth... the contraries of which theology maintains.\" He clarified that such things are \"denied with reference to the laws of nature, but in theology they are affirmed with reference to divine omnipotence and supernaturally.\"\n\nThis same set of distinctions can be applied to the changes in nature resulting from the Fall. Turretin, like other theologians before him such as Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, spoke of the \"corruption of nature\" following the Fall. His framework allows for a \"corruption\" of the natural order (a theological truth about its fallen state) that alters its operations from its original institution, which can be described as a change in the \"laws of nature\" as they were initially constituted.\n\nWhile earlier theologians like Augustine and Aquinas extensively discussed both the virgin birth and the Fall, Turretin is notable for articulating this specific terminological distinction between the philosophical/natural and the theological/supernatural realms as a way to account for both types of events without contradiction.\n\n<<<Francis Turretin>>>"
