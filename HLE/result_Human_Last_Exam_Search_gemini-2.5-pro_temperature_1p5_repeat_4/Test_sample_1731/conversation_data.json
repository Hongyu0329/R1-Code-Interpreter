    "Applying the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems, to a system of light quanta (photons) treated as a Bose gas allows for the determination of its equilibrium thermodynamic properties. These theorems provide a framework for understanding the statistical behavior of the system and identifying the most probable macroscopic state, which corresponds to thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n### Theoretical Framework\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the state of a system is described by the distribution of its constituent particles over available energy levels. For a gas of photons, which are bosons, the number of photons in each energy state can be any non-negative integer. Large deviation theory deals with the probability of rare events, and in this context, it quantifies the probability of observing a macroscopic state that deviates from the most likely one.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem is concerned with the large deviations of the empirical measure of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. When applied to the spatial or energy distribution of photons, the rate function in the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is directly related to the negative of the system's entropy. The equilibrium state, being the most probable, corresponds to the distribution that maximizes the entropy, or equivalently, minimizes the rate function.\n\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem addresses the large deviations of the empirical mean of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables. In the context of a photon gas, this is applied to the mean energy of the system. The rate function here is also linked to the thermodynamic properties. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Cramer-Chernoff large deviation function reaches its minimum value.\n\n### Derivation of Equilibrium Values\n\nTo find the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy, one considers a system of photons in thermal equilibrium at a temperature T. The total energy of the system is constrained, but the total number of photons is not, which is a key characteristic of a photon gas (leading to a chemical potential of zero). The analysis proceeds by finding the most probable distribution of photons among the available energy states, which is the distribution that maximizes the entropy for a given total energy.\n\nThis maximization procedure, carried out within the framework of large deviation theory, leads to the celebrated **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average number of photons in an energy state with energy ε = hν (where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency):\n\n<center>⟨n(ε)⟩ = 1 / (e^(ε/kT) - 1)</center>\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature.\n\nOnce this equilibrium distribution is known, the macroscopic thermodynamic quantities can be calculated.\n\n#### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe mean energy (U) of the photon gas is obtained by summing the energies of all photons, weighted by their equilibrium distribution. This involves integrating the energy of each mode multiplied by the average number of photons in that mode over all possible frequencies, taking into account the density of states g(ν) in a three-dimensional cavity of volume V, which is given by g(ν)dν = (8πV/c³)ν²dν (where c is the speed of light).\n\nThe integration yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy:\n\n<center>U = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴</center>\n\nThus, the mean energy of the photon gas is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature.\n\n#### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nSimilarly, the entropy (S) of the photon gas at equilibrium can be derived from the Bose-Einstein distribution. The entropy is also found to be proportional to the volume and the cube of the temperature:\n\n<center>S = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³</center>\n\nThis result is consistent with the third law of thermodynamics, as the entropy approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the application of large deviation theorems provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for deriving the equilibrium properties of a photon gas, leading to results that are fundamental to our understanding of black-body radiation and quantum statistics.\n\n<<<The equilibrium mean energy of the photon gas is given by U = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³)VT⁴, and the equilibrium entropy is S = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45h³c³)VT³, where V is the volume, T is the temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck's constant, and c is the speed of light.>>>"
