    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas in an aboriginal writing system is \"1 Earthquake.\" This glyph, representing a day in the 260-day ritual calendar, is inscribed on Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\nThe monument, a carved stone slab depicting a slain captive, is dated to approximately 600 BCE. The glyphs carved between the figure's legs are interpreted as his name, based on his birth or a significant event in his life, a common practice in Mesoamerican cultures. This inscription is considered one of the earliest examples of writing in Mesoamerica.\n\nWhile the Olmec civilization had an earlier writing system, exemplified by the Cascajal Block (c. 900 BCE), this artifact does not contain a discernible date. Later, more complex dating systems emerged, such as the Maya Long Count calendar. The earliest known Long Count date, which corresponds to 36 BCE, was found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico. However, the Zapotec \"1 Earthquake\" glyph at San José Mogote predates this by several centuries. New radiocarbon dating places Monument 3 from San José Mogote no later than 630–560 BCE. The inscription not only marks a specific day but is also considered the earliest known named individual in the Americas.\n\n<<<1 Earthquake>>>"
