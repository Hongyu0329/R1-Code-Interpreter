    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, is a non-abelian group with a specific structure. To determine the number of its power subgroups, we first need to understand the definition of a power subgroup and the structure of Q128.\n\n### Structure of the Generalized Quaternion Group Q128\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 128, Q128, can be defined by the presentation:\nQ128 = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x⁴ = 1, x² = a³², and xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >.\n\nThe elements of Q128 are of two forms:\n1.  Powers of `a`: aⁱ for i = 0, 1, ..., 63. These form a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n2.  Elements of the form aⁱx: aⁱx for i = 0, 1, ..., 63.\n\n### Power Subgroups\nA \"power subgroup\" is generally understood as a subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements of the group for some integer k. Let's denote this subgroup as Pₖ.\nPₖ = < gᵏ | g ∈ Q128 >\n\nTo find the number of distinct power subgroups, we need to analyze Pₖ for different values of k. We can categorize this into two cases based on whether k is odd or even.\n\n#### Case 1: k is an odd integer\nWhen k is odd, the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements is Q128 itself.\n\n*   For elements of the form aⁱ, their k-th powers are (aⁱ)ᵏ = aⁱᵏ. Since k is odd, the greatest common divisor of k and 64 is 1. Thus, the subgroup generated by these powers is <a¹> = <a>, the cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n*   For elements of the form aⁱx, their square is (aⁱx)² = aⁱxaⁱx = aⁱ(xaⁱx⁻¹)x² = aⁱ(a⁻¹)ⁱx² = x² = a³². Since k is odd (let k = 2m + 1), the k-th power is (aⁱx)ᵏ = ((aⁱx)²)ᵐ(aⁱx) = (a³²)ᵐ(aⁱx).\n*   The set of all k-th powers, Pₖ, contains the subgroup <a>. It also contains elements like (a³²)ᵐx (by setting i=0). Since <a> is in Pₖ, a⁻³²ᵐ is also in Pₖ. Therefore, the product (a⁻³²ᵐ)((a³²)ᵐx) = x must be in Pₖ.\n*   Since both `a` and `x` are in Pₖ, and these elements generate the entire group, Pₖ = Q128.\n\nThus, for any odd integer k, we get only one distinct power subgroup, which is Q128 itself.\n\n#### Case 2: k is an even integer\nWhen k is an even integer, the analysis yields different subgroups.\n\n*   The k-th power of aⁱ is aⁱᵏ. These elements generate the subgroup < aᵍᶜᵈ(ᵏ,⁶⁴) >.\n*   The k-th power of aⁱx is (aⁱx)ᵏ = ((aⁱx)²)ᵏ/² = (a³²)ᵏ/² = a¹⁶ᵏ.\n*   The power subgroup Pₖ is generated by < aᵍᶜᵈ(ᵏ,⁶⁴) > and a¹⁶ᵏ. Since 16k is a multiple of gcd(k, 64), the element a¹⁶ᵏ is already included in the subgroup < aᵍᶜᵈ(ᵏ,⁶⁴) >.\n*   Therefore, for any even k, Pₖ = < aᵍᶜᵈ(ᵏ,⁶⁴) >.\n\nTo find the number of distinct subgroups in this case, we need to find the number of distinct values that gcd(k, 64) can take when k is an even integer. The possible values are the even divisors of 64.\n\nThe divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\nThe even divisors of 64 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\nThis gives us 6 distinct subgroups:\n1.  < a² >\n2.  < a⁴ >\n3.  < a⁸ >\n4.  < a¹⁶ >\n5.  < a³² >\n6.  < a⁶⁴ > = {e} (the trivial subgroup)\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining both cases, the distinct power subgroups of Q128 are:\n1.  Q128 (from odd k)\n2.  < a² > (from even k, e.g., k=2)\n3.  < a⁴ > (from even k, e.g., k=4)\n4.  < a⁸ > (from even k, e.g., k=8)\n5.  < a¹⁶ > (from even k, e.g., k=16)\n6.  < a³² > (from even k, e.g., k=32)\n7.  {e} (the trivial subgroup, from even k, e.g., k=64)\n\nIn total, there are 7 distinct power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
