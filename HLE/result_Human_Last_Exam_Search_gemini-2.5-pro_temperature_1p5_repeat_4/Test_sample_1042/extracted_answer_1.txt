No, `E(Y^a | A, L)` is not identifiable. The inequality `E(Y^a | A, L) â‰  E(Y^a | L)` indicates that there is residual confounding due to the unmeasured variable `U`, even after conditioning on `L`. To calculate `E(Y^a | A, L)`, one would need to know the distribution of the unmeasured confounder `U` and its relationship with the outcome `Y`, neither of which can be determined from the observed data `(A, L, Y)`.
