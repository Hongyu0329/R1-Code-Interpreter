In the context of the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is given by the integral of the field ϕ multiplied by the action of the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m², on ϕ over the Euclidean spacetime (τ ∈ [0, β], **x** ∈ R³). This can be explicitly written as:

(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)

This expression is directly proportional to the Euclidean action for the free scalar field.
