    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field, denoted by ϕ, is expressed through a functional integral. This formulation is central to understanding the statistical mechanics of quantum fields.\n\nThe partition function, Z, is given by:\n\nZ = ∫Dϕ *exp*(-S_E[ϕ])\n\nHere, the integral is a functional integral over all possible field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time with a period β = 1/T, where T is the temperature. The term S_E[ϕ] represents the Euclidean action for the scalar field.\n\nFor a free, neutral scalar field with mass m, the Euclidean action is:\n\nS_E[ϕ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x ½ [ (∂_τϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ²]\n\nThrough integration by parts, and considering the periodic boundary conditions which lead to the vanishing of boundary terms, the action can be rewritten in a more revealing form:\n\nS_E[ϕ] = -½ ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x ϕ(x) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(x)\n\nFrom this expression, we can identify the operator D_ϕ as:\n\nD_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\n\nThis operator is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n\nThe inner product of two functions in a function space is generally defined as the integral of their product over their common domain. In the context of the functional integral for the partition function, the space is the Euclidean spacetime with imaginary time τ ∈ [0, β] and spatial coordinates **x**. Therefore, the inner product (f, g) of two fields f(x) and g(x) is given by:\n\n(f, g) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x f(x)g(x)\n\nApplying this definition to (ϕ, D_ϕ ϕ), we get:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x ϕ(x)(D_ϕϕ(x)) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x ϕ(x)(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)ϕ(x)\n\nThis is precisely the expression that appears in the Euclidean action (up to a factor of -1/2). Therefore, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field is the integrated product of the field ϕ with the result of the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator acting on ϕ over the Euclidean spacetime.\n\n<<<In the context of the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is given by the integral of the field ϕ multiplied by the action of the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m², on ϕ over the Euclidean spacetime (τ ∈ [0, β], **x** ∈ R³). This can be explicitly written as:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nThis expression is directly proportional to the Euclidean action for the free scalar field."
