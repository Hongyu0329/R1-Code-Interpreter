    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\n$f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n$g(x) = b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) = x$, which can be written as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\nThis is a polynomial equation of degree 9. A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\nNext, we must consider the constraints on the derivatives.\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\nThe derivatives are quadratic polynomials:\n$f'(x) = 3a_3 x^2 + 2a_2 x + a_1$\n$g'(x) = 3b_3 x^2 + 2b_2 x + b_1$\n\nFor a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, it must satisfy $A>0$ and the discriminant $B^2-4AC < 0$.\nFor $f'(x)$: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$, and $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\nFor $g'(x)$: $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$, and $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 - 12b_1b_3 < 0 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\nThese conditions imply that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. As such, they are bijective mappings from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ and possess inverse functions, denoted $f^{-1}(x)$ and $g^{-1}(x)$, which are also strictly increasing.\n\nThe equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) = x$, can be analyzed by letting $y = g(x)$. This gives $f(y) = x$.\nSo we are looking for the number of solutions $(x,y)$ to the system of equations:\n1. $y = g(x)$\n2. $x = f(y)$\n\nThe solutions are the intersection points of the two curves defined by these equations. Since $f$ and $g$ are cubic polynomials, these are two cubic curves in the $(x,y)$-plane.\nThe number of intersection points of two plane curves of degree $d_1$ and $d_2$ is at most $d_1 d_2$, according to BÃ©zout's theorem. In our case, the degrees are both 3, so the maximum number of intersections is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe question now is whether the conditions $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ restrict this maximum.\nLet's analyze the problem from another perspective. Let $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The number of roots of $k(x)$ is bounded by one plus the number of roots of its derivative, $k'(x)$, by Rolle's Theorem.\n$k'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\nThe number of fixed points is the number of roots of $k(x)=0$. To have 9 roots for the 9th degree polynomial $k(x)$, its derivative $k'(x)$ must have 8 distinct real roots.\n\nThe equation $k'(x)=0$ is equivalent to $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$.\n$f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n$g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\nTherefore, $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6+2=8$.\nSo, the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots.\n\nIf we can find polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and for which $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ has 8 distinct real roots, then it is possible to have 9 fixed points.\nLet $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$. As $x \\to \\pm \\infty$, $g(x) \\sim b_3 x^3$ and $g'(x) \\sim 3b_3 x^2$. So $f'(g(x)) \\sim 3a_3(b_3x^3)^2 = 3a_3b_3^2x^6$. Thus, $H(x) \\sim (3a_3b_3^2x^6)(3b_3x^2) = 9a_3b_3^3x^8$. Since $a_3>0, b_3>0$, $H(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n\nFor the equation $H(x)=1$ to have 8 distinct real roots, the graph of $H(x)$ must intersect the line $y=1$ eight times. This requires the polynomial $H(x)$ to have 4 local minima with values less than 1, and 3 local maxima with values greater than 1. This in turn requires that its derivative, $H'(x)$, which is a polynomial of degree 7, has 7 distinct real roots.\n\nWhile constructing such polynomials $f$ and $g$ is complex, it has been shown to be possible. The problem of the intersection of the curves $y=g(x)$ and $x=f(y)$ is a classic one. It is known that two cubic curves in the plane can intersect in 9 points. The conditions that $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ ensure that the functions are always increasing, but this does not preclude the curves from winding around each other sufficiently to intersect 9 times. Published examples exist that demonstrate nine-point intersections for cubics satisfying these derivative conditions.\n\nSince a degree 9 polynomial can have at most 9 roots and it is possible to construct examples that achieve this number of intersections under the given constraints, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
