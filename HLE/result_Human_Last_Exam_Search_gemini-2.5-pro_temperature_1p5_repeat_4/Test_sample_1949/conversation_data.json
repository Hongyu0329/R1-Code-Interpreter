    "Of the rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, most are mythological rivers located in the underworld. However, the poem also features a significant real-world river. When considering the \"three longest,\" it's necessary to look at their real-world counterparts.\n\nThe three longest rivers mentioned in the *Aeneid* that have a basis in the real world are:\n\n1.  **Tiber River**: The most significant real-world river in the epic, the Tiber is central to the establishment of Aeneas and the Trojans in Italy. It is the third-longest river in Italy, with a length of approximately 406 kilometers (252 miles). The river god Tiberinus appears to Aeneas in a dream, confirming he has reached his destined land.\n\n2.  **Acheron River**: While a prominent river of the underworld in the *Aeneid*, the Acheron is also a real river in the Epirus region of Greece. Its length is 52 kilometers (32 miles). In the epic, Aeneas must cross the Acheron in the underworld.\n\n3.  **Lethe River**: The mythological river of forgetfulness in the underworld, Lethe is mentioned in Book 6 of the *Aeneid* as the river from which souls drink to erase their memories before being reincarnated. There is a real-world River Lethe in Alaska, though it is only about 18 kilometers (12 miles) long and its naming is a modern tribute to the myth.\n\nOther rivers in the *Aeneid*, such as the Styx, Cocytus, and Phlegethon, are part of the mythical geography of the underworld. While a \"River Styx\" exists as an underground river in Oregon and is associated with a stream in Greece, it does not have a conventional length for comparison. The Cocytus and Phlegethon do not have measurable real-world counterparts.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid with real-world counterparts are the Tiber, the Acheron, and the Lethe.>>>"
