    "In Pisa, the adjacent buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini on Via Benedetto Croce are architecturally arranged to form a distinct shape when viewed from above. The complex consists of two main parallel buildings which are connected in the middle by a third, shorter perpendicular structure. This configuration clearly forms the letter H.\n\nThe two main institutes, the Liceo Classico \"Galileo Galilei\" and the Istituto Tecnico Economico \"Antonio Pacinotti,\" are part of the larger Istituto di Istruzione Superiore (I.I.S.) Galilei-Pacinotti and are located at Via Benedetto Croce 32 and 34. They stand next to the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini,\" located at number 36 of the same street. The schools are so close that they share an internal courtyard.\n\nAn aerial view of the school complex reveals the two long, parallel buildings of the respective institutes, joined by a central connecting building, unmistakably forming the letter \"H\".\n\n<<<H>>>"
