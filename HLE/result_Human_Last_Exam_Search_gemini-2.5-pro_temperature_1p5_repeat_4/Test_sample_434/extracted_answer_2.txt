A solution to the system of differential equations
$$x'(t)=-3x(t)y(t), \ \ y'(t)=-y^2(t)-x(t)+1,$$
with an initial condition $(x(0), y(0))$ such that $x(0) > 1$ blows up if the solution goes to infinity in finite time. The values of $y(0)$ for which this occurs regardless of the specific choice of $x(0) > 1$ are $y(0) \le 0$.
