The precise amino acid residues within the human beta-1 subunit's Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain that form the Alpha Binding Pocket (ABP) for the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) are located in a highly conserved hydrophobic groove. While a "quartet of leucine residues" is identified as critical in the highly homologous beta-3 subunit, the exact positions in human beta-1 are not specified in the provided results. For gating modulation, key determinants are found in the variable regions. The N-terminus contains residues that influence inactivation. The HOOK region, which connects the SH3 and GK domains, contains polyacidic and polybasic domains that dynamically regulate inactivation and sensitivity to signaling molecules like PIP2. The GK domain itself also possesses intrinsic modulatory capabilities that can influence channel gating independently of the other domains.
