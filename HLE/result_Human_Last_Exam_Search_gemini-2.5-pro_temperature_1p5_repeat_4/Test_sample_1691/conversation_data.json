    "<<<For small $\\epsilon$, the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ can be approximated by an analytical formula derived using asymptotic expansion techniques. The dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$, where the denominator is smallest.\n\nThe resulting analytical formula, including the first two terms of the asymptotic expansion, is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx A \\epsilon^{-4/5} + B \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\n\nwhere the coefficients A and B are given by:\n$A = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n$B = - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)}$\n\nThese expressions can be written in terms of the Gamma function as well. Using Euler's reflection formula, $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$, the coefficients are:\n$A = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5)}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}}$\n$B = - \\frac{2\\Gamma(2/5)\\Gamma(3/5)}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5}}$\n\nNumerically, the approximation is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 0.6888 \\cdot \\epsilon^{-0.8} - 0.0610 \\cdot \\epsilon^{-0.6}$>>>"
