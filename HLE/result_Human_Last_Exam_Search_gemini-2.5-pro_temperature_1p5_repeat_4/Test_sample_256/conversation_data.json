    "The symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1. This information is based on the comprehensive database of circle packings compiled by Eckard Specht.\n\nIn this database, the entry for 1135 circles does not explicitly state a symmetry group. The standard convention for this collection, as noted on the website, is that if the symmetry group field is not filled, the packing possesses C_1 symmetry. C_1 symmetry, in Schoenflies notation, indicates the absence of any rotational or reflectional symmetry, representing an asymmetric arrangement.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
