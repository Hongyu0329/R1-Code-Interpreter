    "The semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, is a non-abelian group of order 2^9. Its structure is defined by the presentation:\n\nSD_512 = < r, s | r^(256) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(127) >\n\nA power subgroup G^k is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in the group G. To find the number of distinct power subgroups of SD_512, we need to analyze the subgroups G^k for all positive integers k.\n\nThe elements of SD_512 are of the form r^i or r^i * s for 0 ≤ i < 256. Let's examine their k-th powers.\n\nFirst, consider the case where k is an odd integer. Since the order of SD_512 is 512 (a power of 2), the order of any element g in SD_512 is also a power of 2. Because k is odd, the greatest common divisor of k and the order of any element g is 1. This implies that the mapping x -> x^k is a bijection on the group. Therefore, for any odd k, the set of k-th powers of all elements is the group itself.\nG^k = G for any odd k. This gives us our first power subgroup, the group SD_512 itself.\n\nNext, consider the case where k is an even integer. Any even integer k can be written as k = 2^j * m, where m is an odd integer and j ≥ 1. The power subgroup G^k can be expressed as:\nG^k = G^(2^j * m) = (G^m)^(2^j)\nSince m is odd, G^m = G. Thus, G^k = G^(2^j). This means we only need to consider the power subgroups for powers of 2.\n\nLet's compute these subgroups:\n*   **k = 2^0 = 1**: G^1 = G = SD_512.\n*   **k = 2^1 = 2**: We need to find the squares of all elements.\n    *   (r^i)^2 = r^(2i)\n    *   (r^i * s)^2 = r^i * s * r^i * s = r^i * (srs)^i * s^2 = r^i * (r^127)^i * 1 = r^i * r^(127i) = r^(128i).\n    The subgroup G^2 is generated by all elements of the form r^(2i) and r^(128i). Since 128 is a multiple of 2, the subgroup generated by {r^(2i), r^(128i)} is the same as the cyclic subgroup generated by r^2, which is <r^2>. This subgroup has an order of 256/2 = 128.\n*   **k = 2^2 = 4**: We need to find the fourth powers of all elements.\n    *   (r^i)^4 = r^(4i)\n    *   (r^i * s)^4 = ((r^i * s)^2)^2 = (r^(128i))^2 = r^(256i) = e (the identity element, since the order of r is 256).\n    The subgroup G^4 is generated by all elements of the form r^(4i), which is the cyclic subgroup <r^4>. This subgroup has an order of 256/4 = 64.\n\nFollowing this pattern, for k = 2^j, the power subgroup G^(2^j) is generated by the elements (r^i)^(2^j) = r^(i*2^j) and (r^i * s)^(2^j) = (r^(128i))^(2^(j-1)) = r^(i*128*2^(j-1)) = r^(i*2^6*2^j). Since for j>=1, 2^6 * 2^j = 2^(j+6) > 2^j, the set of generators for G^(2^j) simplifies to <r^(2^j)>.\n\nWe can now list all the distinct power subgroups by calculating G^(2^j) for j ≥ 0:\n*   j = 0: G^(2^0) = G^1 = **SD_512** (order 512)\n*   j = 1: G^(2^1) = G^2 = **<r^2>** (order 128)\n*   j = 2: G^(2^2) = G^4 = **<r^4>** (order 64)\n*   j = 3: G^(2^3) = G^8 = **<r^8>** (order 32)\n*   j = 4: G^(2^4) = G^16 = **<r^16>** (order 16)\n*   j = 5: G^(2^5) = G^32 = **<r^32>** (order 8)\n*   j = 6: G^(2^6) = G^64 = **<r^64>** (order 4)\n*   j = 7: G^(2^7) = G^128 = **<r^128>** (order 2)\n*   j = 8: G^(2^8) = G^256 = **<r^256>** = **{e}** (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nFor any j > 8, G^(2^j) will also be the trivial subgroup {e}.\n\nThese 9 subgroups are all distinct. Counting them, we find there are 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
