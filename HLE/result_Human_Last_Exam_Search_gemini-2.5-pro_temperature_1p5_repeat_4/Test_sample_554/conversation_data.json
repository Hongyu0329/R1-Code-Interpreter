    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain a number of fluorine atoms equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar structure. The term \"perfluoro\" signifies that all hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nSince the term \"nanocar\" can refer to different molecular structures, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar depends on the specific nanocar in question. For example, one synthesized nanocar with a flexible chassis has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. A perfluorinated version of this specific nanocar would therefore have the formula C₃₁₀F₃₄, containing 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nDifferent nanocar designs have different numbers of hydrogen atoms. For instance, a \"Nanotruck\" molecule has the formula C₂₈₂H₁₈N₄, which, if perfluorinated, would contain 18 fluorine atoms. Another design, known as the \"Nanodragster,\" also exists, and its perfluorinated version would have a different number of fluorine atoms based on its unique structure.\n\nTherefore, to determine the exact number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar, one must first identify the chemical structure of the specific nanocar.\n\n<<<34>>>"
