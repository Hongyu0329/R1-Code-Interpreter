    "The provided sequence of numbers is:\n111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\n\nAn immediate observation of the final numbers in the sequence reveals an alternating pattern. The last three numbers are 124, 36, 124. Following this simple alternation, the next number in the sequence would be 36.\n\nA deeper analysis of the sequence reveals a more complex pattern of paired numbers. Groups of repeating numbers appear to be linked. For instance:\n\n*   A pair of **62**s is followed by **111**.\n*   A pair of **111**s is followed by **62**.\n\nThis suggests a reciprocal relationship between 62 and 111. A similar relationship can be seen between 36 and 124:\n\n*   A triplet of **36**s is followed by **124**.\n*   A triplet of **124**s is followed by **36**.\n\nThis confirms a pairing between 36 and 124. The end of the sequence shows a single 36 followed by a single 124. Based on the established alternating relationship between these two numbers, the next number is expected to be 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
