    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the number of chiral edge states at the junction is determined by the difference between their individual Chern numbers.\n\nThe number of chiral edge modes at the interface between two regions with Chern numbers C₁ and C₂ is given by the absolute value of their difference, |C₁ - C₂|. This fundamental principle arises from the bulk-boundary correspondence, which dictates that a change in the topological invariant across an interface will lead to the emergence of gapless states.\n\nIn this specific case, we have two Chern insulators with C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1. Therefore, the number of chiral edge states at their junction is:\n\n|1 - 1| = 0\n\nThis means that no topologically protected chiral edge states will exist along the interface where the two Chern insulators meet. While each insulator individually hosts conducting edge states on its outer boundaries, the junction between them will be insulating. This concept has been explored in the context of creating topological circuits and controlling the flow of currents at the nanoscale. For instance, a junction between a Chern insulator with C=1 and one with C=2 would host a single chiral edge mode.\n\nIt's important to note that while the junction itself doesn't have a Chern number in the same way the bulk materials do, its properties are directly and predictably determined by the topological invariants of the materials it connects.\n\n<<<0>>>"
