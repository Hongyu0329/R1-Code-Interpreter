    "In a quantum mechanical version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the introduction of entanglement between the players' states allows for the emergence of a new Nash equilibrium that can resolve the classical dilemma. By utilizing quantum strategies on an initially entangled state, the players can achieve a Pareto-optimal outcome that is not accessible in the classical version of the game.\n\nThe classical Prisoner's Dilemma with the given payoff matrix has a single Nash equilibrium at (Defect, Defect), resulting in a payoff of (1, 1) for each player. This outcome is suboptimal, as mutual cooperation would yield a higher payoff of (5, 5) for both.\n\nIn the quantum realm, within the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, players can apply unitary transformations to their respective qubits. With a maximally entangled initial state, a new strategy, often denoted as 'Q', becomes available. This quantum strategy corresponds to a specific unitary operation.\n\nWhen both players choose this quantum strategy 'Q', a new Nash equilibrium is established. At this equilibrium, neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. The payoff at this quantum Nash equilibrium is the average of the \"temptation\" payoff (when a player defects while the other cooperates) and the \"sucker\" payoff (when a player cooperates while the other defects).\n\nFor the given payoff matrix:\n*   The temptation payoff for each player is 7 (defecting while the opponent cooperates).\n*   The sucker's payoff for each player is 0 (cooperating while the opponent defects).\n\nTherefore, the payoff for each player at the quantum Nash equilibrium is calculated as:\n\n(7 + 0) / 2 = 3.5\n\nThis results in an equilibrium point where both players receive a payoff of 3.5. This outcome is superior to the classical Nash equilibrium of (1, 1), thus resolving the dilemma. The existence of quantum entanglement and the availability of quantum strategies enable a more favorable and stable outcome.\n\n<<<3.5, 3.5>>>"
