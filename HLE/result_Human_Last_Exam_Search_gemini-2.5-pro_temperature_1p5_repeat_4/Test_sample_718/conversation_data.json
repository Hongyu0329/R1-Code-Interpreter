    "An `n`-resolvable object in homological algebra is one that has a projective resolution of length at most `n`. The question is asking for the projective dimension of a tame functor `f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K`, where `J` is an upper semilattice.\n\nA key result in the theory of tame functors is that when the indexing poset `J` is an upper semilattice, the category of tame functors, `tame(J, Vect_K)`, is an abelian category. In such a category, every object admits a minimal free resolution. Since free objects are projective, this guarantees the existence of a projective resolution.\n\nThe length of this resolution is determined by the global dimension of the category. The target category, `Vect_K` (the category of vector spaces over a field `K`), has a global dimension of 0, as every object is projective. When considering functors from a poset to `Vect_K`, the homological properties are lifted from `Vect_K` to the functor category.\n\nFor tame functors indexed by a poset of dimension at most 1, it has been shown that the category of such functors has well-behaved homological properties, and indecomposable objects have a simple structure. Specifically for persistence modules indexed by the real line `R` (which is an upper semilattice), the category of tame modules is equivalent to the category of finitely presented modules over the polynomial ring `K[x]`, which has a global dimension of 1. This means any such module has a projective resolution of length at most 1.\n\nThis property generalizes to tame functors over any upper semilattice. Any tame functor `F` can be expressed as the cokernel of a morphism between projective functors, leading to a projective resolution of the form:\n\n$0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to F \\to 0$\n\nwhere `P_0` and `P_1` are projective functors. An object that has a projective resolution of length at most 1 is, by definition, 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
