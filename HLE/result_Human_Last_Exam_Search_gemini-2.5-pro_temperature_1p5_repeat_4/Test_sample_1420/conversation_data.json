    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat is determined using the epsilon (ε) expansion near the upper critical dimension (d_c).\n\n1.  **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c)**: For a system described by a scalar order parameter (like the Ising model, with n=1 component), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. Above this dimension, the critical exponents take on their mean-field theory values.\n\n2.  **The Epsilon Expansion**: The ε-expansion is a perturbative technique used to calculate critical exponents in dimensions d < d_c. The expansion is done in powers of the small parameter ε = d_c - d. For the given problem with a spatial dimension d=3, we have ε = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\n3.  **Formula for Critical Exponent α**: The epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α, for a general n-component model, is given by:\n    α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ε + O(ε²)\n\n4.  **Calculation for d=3**: For the specified system with spatial dimension d=3, we use ε=1. Assuming the simplest case of a scalar order parameter (n=1), we can substitute these values into the formula to the first order in ε:\n    α = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) * 1\n    α = 3 / (2 * 9)\n    α = 3 / 18\n    α = 1/6\n\nTherefore, to the first order in the epsilon expansion, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
