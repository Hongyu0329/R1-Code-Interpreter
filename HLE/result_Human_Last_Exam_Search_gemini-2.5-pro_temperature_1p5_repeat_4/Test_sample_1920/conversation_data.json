    "The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6 is 1200.\n\nTo arrive at this result, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Factor the Conductor**\n\nFirst, the conductor $d = 53599$ is factored into its prime components. The factorization is:\n$d = 7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31$\n\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct primes (i.e., it is square-free), a primitive Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $d$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters, each with a conductor corresponding to one of the prime factors of $d$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a primitive Dirichlet character of conductor $p$.\n\n**2. Determine the Order of the Product Character**\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its constituent characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$\nWe are looking for characters where this order is 6.\n\n**3. Count Available Characters for Each Prime Factor**\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a prime conductor $p$ with a specific order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nFor the prime factors of $d=53599$:\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1=6$.\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1=12$.\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1=18$.\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1=30$.\n\nIn each case, $p-1$ is divisible by 6. This means that for each prime factor, primitive characters of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6 exist. The number of characters for each of these orders is:\n*   Order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$\n*   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\n**4. Combine the Characters Using Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nTo find the number of characters $\\chi$ of order 6, we need to count the number of combinations of the component characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6. We can solve this using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet $N_k$ be the number of characters modulo $p$ whose order divides $k$. This is the sum of $\\phi(j)$ for all $j$ that divide $k$, which simplifies to $k$.\n\n*   The total number of combinations of characters where the order of each component divides 6 is $N_6^4 = (\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6))^4 = (1+1+2+2)^4 = 6^4 = 1296$.\n\nFrom this total, we must subtract the combinations where the lcm of the orders is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3).\n\n*   The number of combinations where all orders divide 3 is $N_3^4 = (\\phi(1)+\\phi(3))^4 = (1+2)^4 = 3^4 = 81$.\n*   The number of combinations where all orders divide 2 is $N_2^4 = (\\phi(1)+\\phi(2))^4 = (1+1)^4 = 2^4 = 16$.\n*   When we subtract the above two sets, we have twice subtracted the cases where all orders divide 1. The number of such combinations is $N_1^4 = (\\phi(1))^4 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nThe number of combinations where the lcm of the orders is a proper divisor of 6 is $81 + 16 - 1 = 96$.\n\nFinally, the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is the total number of combinations with orders dividing 6, minus those with orders properly dividing 6:\n\n$1296 - 96 = 1200$.\n\n<<<1200>>>"
