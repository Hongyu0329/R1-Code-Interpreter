    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation, utilizing Feynman's path integral formalism, is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields. The transition from real time to imaginary time is achieved through a Wick rotation, which connects quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics.\n\nThe partition function, Z, is defined as:\n<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Z = ∫ Dψ Dψ̄ e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ, ψ̄]</sup>**\n<br>\n<br>\nWhere the components of this formula are:\n\n*   **∫ Dψ Dψ̄**: This represents the Feynman path integral, which is a sum over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields ψ and its conjugate ψ̄. Crucially, for fermions, these fields are not ordinary numbers but are elements of a Grassmann algebra, also known as anti-commuting numbers. This mathematical property correctly accounts for the Pauli exclusion principle that governs fermionic behavior.\n\n*   **ψ(τ, x)** and **ψ̄(τ, x)**: These are the Grassmann-valued fermionic fields, which are functions of imaginary time τ and spatial coordinates x.\n\n*   **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ, ψ̄]**: This is the Euclidean action of the system, which is obtained from the standard action in Minkowski spacetime by a Wick rotation to imaginary time (t → -iτ). The action is an integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density, L<sub>E</sub>, over imaginary time and space:\n\n    **S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x L<sub>E</sub>(ψ, ψ̄, ∂<sub>μ</sub>ψ, ∂<sub>μ</sub>ψ̄)**\n\n    Here, β is the inverse temperature (β = 1/k<sub>B</sub>T, where k<sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature). The integral over imaginary time runs from 0 to β. For example, for a free, non-relativistic fermionic field, the Euclidean action is of the form:\n\n    **S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ̄(τ, x) (∂<sub>τ</sub> + H<sub>0</sub>) ψ(τ, x)**\n\n    where H<sub>0</sub> is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator (e.g., -ħ²/2m ∇² - μ).\n\n*   **Anti-periodic Boundary Conditions**: A key feature of the fermionic path integral in imaginary time is the imposition of anti-periodic boundary conditions on the fermion fields in the imaginary time direction. This means the fields at the beginning and end of the imaginary time interval are anti-related:\n\n    **ψ(τ=0, x) = -ψ(τ=β, x)**\n    **ψ̄(τ=0, x) = -ψ̄(τ=β, x)**\n\n    These boundary conditions are a direct consequence of the fermionic statistics and are essential for correctly calculating the thermal properties of fermionic systems. They lead to the quantization of energy levels in imaginary time, known as Matsubara frequencies, which for fermions are given by ω<sub>n</sub> = (2n+1)π/β, where n is an integer.\n\nIn summary, the formula integrates the exponential of the negative Euclidean action over all possible anti-periodic field histories to sum up the thermal fluctuations and determine the partition function of the fermionic system. For non-interacting theories, this Gaussian path integral can be evaluated exactly, resulting in the determinant of the operator in the action.\n\n<<<Z = ∫ Dψ Dψ̄ e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ, ψ̄]</sup>, where ψ and ψ̄ are Grassmann fields satisfying anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time, ψ(τ+β) = -ψ(τ), and S<sub>E</sub> is the Euclidean action.>>>"
