    "Opened single-dose ampules should not be stored for any period and must be used immediately. Once an ampule is opened, its contents are exposed to the environment, and it cannot be resealed to maintain sterility.\n\nAccording to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>, opened single-dose ampules must be used right away, and any remaining contents should be discarded. This guidance applies regardless of whether the ampule is opened in a sterile environment, such as an ISO Class 5 cleanroom. There is no permissible beyond-use date (BUD) for a stored, opened ampule.\n\nIn contrast, a single-dose *vial* that has been punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, as long as storage requirements are met. However, this does not apply to ampules, which are designed for single-use and immediate administration.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must be used immediately and cannot be stored; any remaining contents must be discarded.>>>"
