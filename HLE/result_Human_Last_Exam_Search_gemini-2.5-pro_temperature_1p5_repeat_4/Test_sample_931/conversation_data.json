    "Adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) are predators that primarily feed on small, soft-bodied insects like aphids. They are considered important predators of aphids and mites. Some species have also been recorded feeding on nectar and pollen. Specifically, pollen has been found in the guts of some adult snakeflies, although it is not definitively known if this is a required food source. Adults of at least some species can feed on sugary substances, and some are reported to take nectar.\n\nGiven the options:\n*   **A. Nectar:** There are reports of adult snakeflies feeding on nectar.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** Māhoe is a plant native to New Zealand. An attempt to introduce a species of snakefly to New Zealand in the early 20th century failed, and they are not established there. Therefore, there are no records of them feeding on Māhoe pollen.\n*   **C. Fungus:** There is no evidence that adult snakeflies feed on fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Karamū is also a plant native to New Zealand. For the same reason as Māhoe pollen, snakeflies have not been recorded feeding on it. They are also not known to feed on leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** While Totara is a tree native to New Zealand, adult snakeflies are well-documented predators of aphids in general.\n\nBased on the evidence, adult Raphidiopterans have been recorded feeding on both nectar (A) and aphids (a category that includes Totara Aphids, E). Therefore, option F, which includes both A and E, is the most comprehensive answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
