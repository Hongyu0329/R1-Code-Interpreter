    "There are exactly **13** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for all elements *a* and *b* in *S*, their product *ab* is not in *S*. Such a set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by the work of Michael Giudici, Sarah Hart, and Chimere Anabanti. In 2009, Giudici and Hart began the classification by examining groups of small orders. Subsequently, in 2015, Anabanti and Hart proved a conjecture stating that any finite group *G* with a maximal product-free set of size 3 must have an order of at most 24. This result confirmed that the list of such groups found by examining groups up to order 24 is complete.\n\nThe complete list of these groups is provided in a table in the paper \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\" by Anabanti and Hart, which is a reproduction of an earlier table by Giudici and Hart. By counting the distinct groups mentioned in this classification, we arrive at the total number.\n\nThe 13 finite groups are:\n*   **Cyclic groups:** C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂, C₁₄\n*   **Dihedral groups:** D₆, D₈, D₁₀\n*   **Quaternion group:** Q₈\n*   **Alternating group:** A₄\n\nThe dihedral group D₆ is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃. The groups are of orders ranging from 5 to 14.\n\n<<<13>>>"
