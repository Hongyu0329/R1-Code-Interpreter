    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who relates a description of Roman religious practices that alludes to Romulus and Remus is **Hiarandi of the Elkings**.\n\nWhile on the march to the Folk-Mote, in Chapter VI, \"They Talk on the Way to the Folk-Thing,\" Hiarandi recounts the story of a man of the Gael who had been captured and enslaved by the Romans. This captive had observed Roman customs firsthand before escaping and sharing his knowledge.\n\nHiarandi relays this information to his fellow warriors, and in his account, he makes a direct reference to the founding myth of Rome, stating:\n\n\"Yea, and they have a Wolf of their own, and he is a she-wolf; and she is the mother of the very man that built their first garth, and he is a God of their city and their folk; and him and his brother she suckled when they were children, and before they had learned the lore of men.\"\n\nThis passage clearly refers to the legend of Romulus and Remus, who were said to have been suckled by a she-wolf before founding the city of Rome.\n\n<<<Hiarandi of the Elkings>>>"
