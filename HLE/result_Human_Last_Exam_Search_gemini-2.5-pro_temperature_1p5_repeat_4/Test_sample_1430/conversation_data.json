    "The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted as ρ(X), is determined by the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of the curve C. For a genus *g* curve C and its *d*-th symmetric power X = C<sup>(d)</sup>, where *d* ≥ *g*, the following formula holds:\n\nρ(X) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))\n\nIn this problem, C is a genus *g* = 3 Riemann surface, and X is its 15th symmetric power, so *d* = 15. Since 15 ≥ 3, the formula applies. Therefore, to find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of X, we must determine the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, ρ(Jac(C)).\n\n### Smallest Rank\n\nFor a \"very general\" curve C of genus *g*, its Jacobian J(C) is a simple abelian variety with the minimal possible endomorphism ring, End(J(C)) = ℤ. In this case, the Néron-Severi group NS(J(C)) is generated by the class of the canonical polarization, and its rank is 1. This is the smallest possible rank for the Jacobian of a curve of any genus greater than 0.\n\nThus, the minimum possible value for ρ(Jac(C)) for a genus 3 curve is 1.\n\nThe smallest possible rank of NS(X) is therefore:\nρ(X)<sub>min</sub> = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))<sub>min</sub> = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of a complex abelian variety of dimension *g* is bounded by the Hodge number h<sup>1,1</sup>, which is equal to *g*<sup>2</sup>. For the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, this upper bound is 3<sup>2</sup> = 9. This maximum is achieved for specific curves whose Jacobians are of \"CM-type\" (Complex Multiplication). More precisely, the Jacobian must be isogenous to the product of three mutually isogenous elliptic curves with complex multiplication. It is known that such curves of genus 3 exist, and thus Jacobians of genus 3 curves can have a Néron-Severi rank of 9.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value for ρ(Jac(C)) for a genus 3 curve is 9.\n\nThe largest possible rank of NS(X) is:\nρ(X)<sub>max</sub> = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))<sub>max</sub> = 1 + 9 = 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
