The approximate number of logical non-Clifford gates for a small universal quantum computation demonstration like factoring 21 is around 14. For a surface code with a 1% physical error rate, a distance-3 code is likely insufficient. For a distance-5 code, producing these logical gates would require at least one round of magic state distillation, leading to an estimate of several hundred to a few thousand physical non-Clifford gates. A more realistic estimate for a successful computation would be in the range of 200 to 3,500 physical non-Clifford gates, with the precise number being highly dependent on the chosen distillation strategy and the required final logical fidelity.
