    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we must first break down the number of functions for each type of atom and then sum them for the entire molecule.\n\n### Breakdown of the 6-31G Basis Set\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes a split-valence basis set developed by Pople and his group. Here is how to interpret it for each atom type in toluene:\n\n*   **For Carbon (a heavy atom):**\n    *   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The '6' indicates that the core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted basis function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions. This accounts for **1 contracted function**.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p):** The '-31G' signifies that the valence shell is split into two basis functions for each atomic orbital (a double-zeta basis).\n        *   The inner part of the valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is represented by one set of contracted functions. In Pople basis sets, the s and p functions share exponents in what is called an 'sp' shell. This shell consists of one s-function and three p-functions (px, py, pz), all derived from 3 primitive Gaussians. This gives a total of **4 contracted functions**.\n        *   The outer part of the valence shell is similarly composed of one s-function and three p-functions, each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds another **4 contracted functions**.\n    *   Therefore, each carbon atom uses a total of 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted basis functions**.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen (a light atom):**\n    *   **Valence Orbital (1s):** Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s valence orbital is split into two parts based on the '-31G' notation.\n        *   The inner part is a contracted function of 3 primitive Gaussians. This gives **1 contracted function**.\n        *   The outer part is represented by a single primitive Gaussian function. This gives another **1 contracted function**.\n    *   Thus, each hydrogen atom uses a total of 1 + 1 = **2 contracted basis functions**.\n\n### Calculation for Toluene (C7H8)\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of functions for the toluene molecule, which is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:** 7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom = **63 contracted functions**\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:** 8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom = **16 contracted functions**\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of the contributions from all atoms:\n\n**Total Functions = 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79**\n\n<<<79>>>"
