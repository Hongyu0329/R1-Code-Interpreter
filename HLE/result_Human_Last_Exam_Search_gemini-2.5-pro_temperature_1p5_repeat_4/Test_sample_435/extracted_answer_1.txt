Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to have an increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IFNγ and TNFα) compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting T cell survival, proliferation, and effector functions, leading to more robust and sustained activation upon antigen encounter.
