    "Let $S$ be a schema containing $k=4$ unary predicates, which we denote by $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. The logic is $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. We want to determine the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the class of sets definable by formulas in this logic.\n\n### 1. The Class of Definable Sets\n\nA concept class in this context is a collection of subsets of a universe $U$. Each subset is defined by a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$. The set defined by $\\phi(x)$ is $\\{a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$, where $M$ is a model with universe $U$ and interpretations $S_i \\subseteq U$ for the predicates $P_i$. The VC dimension of the logic is the maximum possible VC dimension over all possible models $M$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x) \\in \\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. Since the predicates are unary, any atomic formula is of the form $P_i(v)$ for some variable $v$. A formula $\\phi(x)$ is constructed using only existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\nA general formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ can be written as:\n$\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula, i.e., a conjunction of atomic formulas. We can separate the atomic formulas involving $x$ from those only involving the existentially quantified variables $y_j$:\n$\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m) = \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_{k_j}(y_{l_j}) \\right)$\nfor some index sets $I$ and $J$.\n\nThe structure of the formula allows us to separate the parts related to $x$ and the $y_j$ variables:\n$\\phi(x) = \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_{k_j}(y_{l_j}) \\right)$\n\nThe second part of the conjunction, $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_{k_j}(y_{l_j})$, is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). For any given model $M$, this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If the sentence is false, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (false), which defines the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n*   If the sentence is true, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. This formula defines the set $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$.\n\nThe constants $\\top$ and $\\bot$ define the entire universe $U$ and the empty set $\\emptyset$, respectively. The empty conjunction (when $I=\\emptyset$) is equivalent to $\\top$.\nTherefore, for any given model $M$, the class of all definable sets, which we call the concept class $\\mathcal{C}$, is:\n$\\mathcal{C} = \\left\\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\right\\}$\nThis is the family of all sets that can be formed by intersecting the predicate interpretations $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$.\n\n### 2. Computing the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ is the maximum size $d$ of a set $Y \\subseteq U$ that can be shattered by $\\mathcal{C}$. A set $Y$ is shattered if for every subset $Y' \\subseteq Y$, there exists a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $Y \\cap C = Y'$.\n\nLet $k=4$ be the number of unary predicates. We will show that the VC dimension is $k$.\n\n#### Part 1: VC dimension is at least 4\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must construct a model (a universe $U$ and predicate interpretations $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$) in which a set of size 4 can be shattered.\n\nLet's choose a universe $U$ containing a set $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$. Let's define the predicate interpretations $S_i$ on this universe as follows:\n*   $S_1 = (Y \\setminus \\{y_1\\}) \\cup (U \\setminus Y)$\n*   $S_2 = (Y \\setminus \\{y_2\\}) \\cup (U \\setminus Y)$\n*   $S_3 = (Y \\setminus \\{y_3\\}) \\cup (U \\setminus Y)$\n*   $S_4 = (Y \\setminus \\{y_4\\}) \\cup (U \\setminus Y)$\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary subset $Y' \\subseteq Y$. We need to show that there is a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $Y \\cap C = Y'$.\nLet $I_{Y'} = \\{i \\mid y_i \\notin Y'\\}$. The corresponding concept is $C = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_{Y'}} S_i$.\nLet's analyze the intersection of this concept with $Y$:\n$Y \\cap C = Y \\cap \\left( \\bigcap_{i \\in I_{Y'}} S_i \\right) = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_{Y'}} (Y \\cap S_i)$.\nFrom our definition of $S_i$, we have $Y \\cap S_i = Y \\setminus \\{y_i\\}$.\nSo, $Y \\cap C = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_{Y'}} (Y \\setminus \\{y_i\\}) = Y \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_{Y'}} \\{y_i\\}$.\nThe set $\\bigcup_{i \\in I_{Y'}} \\{y_i\\}$ consists of all elements from $Y$ that are *not* in $Y'$. This set is precisely $Y \\setminus Y'$.\nTherefore, $Y \\cap C = Y \\setminus (Y \\setminus Y') = Y'$.\n\nSince we can form any subset $Y'$ of $Y$ by intersecting $Y$ with a concept from $\\mathcal{C}$, the set $Y$ of size 4 is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n#### Part 2: VC dimension is at most 4\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at most 4, we need to show that no set of size 5 can be shattered, regardless of the choice of the universe and the interpretations of the predicates.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H} = \\{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$ be the family of 4 predicate sets. The concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ is the set of all finite intersections of sets in $\\mathcal{H}$ (plus the universe itself, which is the empty intersection). We will show that for any collection $\\mathcal{H}$ of $k$ sets, the VC dimension of its intersection closure is at most $k$.\n\nLet $Y$ be any set of size $k+1=5$, say $Y = \\{y_0, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $Y$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{C}$. This means that for any subset of $Y$, including the singletons, there exists a corresponding concept. In particular, for each $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, the subset $Y_j = Y \\setminus \\{y_j\\}$ must be representable as $Y \\cap C_j$ for some $C_j \\in \\mathcal{C}$.\n$C_j = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_j} S_i$ for some index set $I_j \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe condition $Y \\cap C_j = Y \\setminus \\{y_j\\}$ implies two things:\n1.  For any $l \\ne j$, $y_l \\in C_j$. This means $y_l \\in S_i$ for all $i \\in I_j$.\n2.  $y_j \\notin C_j$. This means there must be at least one index $i_j \\in I_j$ such that $y_j \\notin S_{i_j}$.\n\nWe have 5 points $y_j$ (for $j=0, \\dots, 4$), and for each we have selected a predicate set $S_{i_j}$ from the 4 available sets. We have 5 indices $i_0, i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4$, each from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these indices must be the same. Let's say $i_a = i_b = m$ for two distinct $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nFrom our construction, we have:\n*   $y_a \\notin S_{i_a} \\implies y_a \\notin S_m$. (from condition 2 for $y_a$)\n*   $y_b \\notin S_{i_b} \\implies y_b \\notin S_m$. (from condition 2 for $y_b$)\n\nNow, let's use condition 1. For point $y_a$, the set $Y \\setminus \\{y_a\\}$ is formed. Since $b \\ne a$, $y_b$ must be in this set. This means $y_b \\in C_a = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_a} S_i$. Consequently, $y_b$ must be in every set $S_i$ for $i \\in I_a$. In particular, $y_b \\in S_{i_a} = S_m$.\n\nWe have derived that $y_b \\in S_m$ and $y_b \\notin S_m$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that a set of size 5 can be shattered must be false.\n\nThis proves that the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4, it must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
