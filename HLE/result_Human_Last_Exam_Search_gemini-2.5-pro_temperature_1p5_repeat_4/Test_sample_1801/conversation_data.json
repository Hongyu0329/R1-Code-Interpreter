    "The two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Kenneth Arrow**.\n\nThe campaign, which preceded Enron's colossal collapse, featured a series of commercials intended to portray the company as a forward-thinking and innovative powerhouse. Both Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, and Arrow, a co-recipient of the 1972 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his pioneering work on social choice and general equilibrium theory, were associated with the Santa Fe Institute, a research center focused on complex systems. Their appearance lent an air of intellectual credibility to the energy-trading corporation.\n\nPhysicist and Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann was identified as a participant in one of the commercials. In a later interview, Gell-Mann himself recounted being paid a substantial fee to appear in the \"successful commercial\" and even being renewed for a second year. The commercials aimed to show Enron as a company that questioned the status quo, a theme that resonated with the intellectual leanings of the Santa Fe Institute. While direct video evidence featuring Arrow is less prominent, the connection through the Santa Fe Institute and the campaign's theme of iconoclastic thinking links both Nobel laureates to the ill-fated advertising effort.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Kenneth Arrow>>>"
