    "The problem asks to evaluate the integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` from 0 to 1, where `F₃(x)` is defined through a sequence of functions. Let `V` be the value of this integral. We are then asked to find the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n\nFirst, let's define the functions:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\nThe integrand is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This form is the result of the chain rule when differentiating `ln(F₃(x))`. Specifically, the derivative of `ln(f(x))` with respect to `x` is `f'(x)/f(x)`.\n\nTherefore, the integral is:\n`∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)|`\n\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1 = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\nNow, let's calculate `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`:\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\nFor `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is between `0` and `sin(1)`. Since `sin(1)` is positive, `e^(sin(x))` is greater than `e⁰=1`. Thus, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is greater than 2, and `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is greater than `ln(2)`, which is positive. This means we can remove the absolute value signs.\n\nThe value of the integral `V` is:\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can write:\n`V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can now use a calculator:\n*   `sin(1)` (in radians) ≈ 0.84147\n*   `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.84147` ≈ 2.31978\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 3.31978\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(3.31978)` ≈ 1.20002\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2)` ≈ 0.69315\n\nNow, we calculate V:\n*   `V = ln(1.20002) - ln(0.69315)` ≈ 0.18234 - (-0.36651) ≈ 0.54885\n\nFinally, we multiply this value by 10000:\n`10000 * V` ≈ `10000 * 0.54885 = 5488.5`\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.5 is 5489.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
