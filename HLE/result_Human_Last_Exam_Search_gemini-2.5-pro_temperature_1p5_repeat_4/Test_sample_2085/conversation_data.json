    "### The French Equivalent of \"Odobeccus\" is Likely a Term for \"Bad Breath\"\n\nThe Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" most plausibly translates to \"he who has a stinking mouth\" or \"bad-smelling beak,\" and its closest French equivalent in meaning and structure is the informal expression **Pue-du-bec**.\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is a compound of two Gaulish elements: \"odo-\" and \"-beccus.\"\n\n*   **-beccus**: This element is well-documented as the Gaulish word for \"beak\" or \"snout.\" It is the direct ancestor of the French word *bec*, which means \"beak\" and is colloquially used for \"mouth\".\n\n*   **odo-**: This element is believed to derive from a Proto-Indo-European root **od-*, which means \"to have a (repulsive) smell\". This is supported by the etymology of the Gaulish river name *Odouna*, interpreted as \"the-odoriferous\". This same root gave Latin the word *odor*.\n\nTherefore, \"Odobeccus\" would describe a person with a \"smelly beak\" or, more idiomatically, \"bad breath.\"\n\nWhile a direct, phonetically evolved equivalent of \"Odobeccus\" in modern French has not been identified, the French language has an expression that perfectly mirrors the meaning and structure of the Gaulish name: **Pue-du-bec**. This term is composed of:\n\n*   **Pue**: From the verb *puer*, meaning \"to stink.\"\n*   **du**: Meaning \"of the\" or \"from the.\"\n*   **bec**: The direct descendant of the Gaulish *beccus*.\n\nThe expression *pue-du-bec* is used to describe a person with foul-smelling breath. For example, a 1929 text by Fran√ßois Mauriac uses the term in this exact sense: \"[Lange] had reached the age where one calls 'pue-du-bec' the classmate with bad breath.\"\n\nAn alternative suggestion of \"Sent-du-Bec\" is likely incorrect. The French verb *sentir* (\"to smell\") does not derive from the Gaulish \"odo-,\" but from the Latin *sentire*, meaning \"to feel\" or \"to perceive with the senses.\" There is no evidence of the Gaulish \"od-\" evolving into \"Sent-\" in French.\n\nThus, while not a direct phonetic descendant, **Pue-du-bec** is the most accurate and functionally equivalent term in French for the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus.\"\n\n<<<Pue-du-bec>>>"
