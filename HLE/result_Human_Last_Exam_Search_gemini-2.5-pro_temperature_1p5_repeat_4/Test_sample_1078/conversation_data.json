    "There are four non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThe classification of finite Weyl groups is based on the connected Dynkin diagrams, where the rank of the group corresponds to the number of vertices in the diagram. For rank 4, the possible irreducible Dynkin diagrams are A₄, B₄, C₄, D₄, and F₄.\n\nThese correspond to the following Weyl groups:\n*   **W(A₄):** The Weyl group of type A₄, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₅. Its order is 5! = 120.\n*   **W(B₄):** The Weyl group of type B₄. Its order is 2⁴ * 4! = 384.\n*   **W(C₄):** The Weyl group of type C₄. This group is isomorphic to W(B₄).\n*   **W(D₄):** The Weyl group of type D₄. Its order is 2³ * 4! = 192.\n*   **W(F₄):** The exceptional Weyl group of type F₄. It has an order of 1152.\n\nSince W(B₄) and W(C₄) are isomorphic, we are left with four distinct groups. As these four groups—W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), and W(F₄)—all have different orders, they are non-isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, there are four non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
