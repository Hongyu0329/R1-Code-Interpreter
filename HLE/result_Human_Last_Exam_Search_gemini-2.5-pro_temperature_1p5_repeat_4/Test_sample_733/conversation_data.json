    "There are **9** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all `a, b` in `S`, the product `ab` is not an element of `S`. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (also known as a locally maximal product-free set) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing a maximal product-free set of size 2 was provided by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. According to their work, a finite group `G` has a maximal product-free set `S` of size 2 if and only if `G` is isomorphic to one of the following nine groups:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:**\n    *   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted `C₅`.\n    *   The cyclic group of order 6, denoted `C₆`.\n    *   The cyclic group of order 8, denoted `C₈`.\n    *   The cyclic group of order 10, denoted `C₁₀`.\n    *   The cyclic group of order 12, denoted `C₁₂`.\n\n*   **Dihedral Groups:**\n    *   The dihedral group of order 6, `D₆` (isomorphic to the symmetric group `S₃`).\n    *   The dihedral group of order 8, `D₈`.\n\n*   **Other Groups:**\n    *   The alternating group on 4 elements, `A₄`.\n    *   The dicyclic group of order 12, `Q₁₂` (also referred to as the generalized quaternion group of order 12).\n\nThese nine distinct isomorphism classes of finite groups are the only ones that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\n<<<9>>>"
