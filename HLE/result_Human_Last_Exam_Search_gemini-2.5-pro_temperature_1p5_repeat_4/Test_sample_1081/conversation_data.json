    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori, up to conjugacy by the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the number of so-called $F$-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group $W$.\n\nLet $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Assuming $G$ is the split Chevalley group (which is standard unless a twisted form is specified), the associated Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W = W(E_8)$. In this case, the $F$-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$. The structure and conjugacy classes of the exceptional Weyl groups were famously determined by Roger Carter in 1972.\n\nThe Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$, is a finite group of order 696,729,600. According to the classification of its conjugacy classes, the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has exactly 112 conjugacy classes. This number is a well-established result in the theory of reflection groups.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
