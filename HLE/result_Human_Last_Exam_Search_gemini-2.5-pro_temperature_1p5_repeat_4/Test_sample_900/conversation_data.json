    "## No \"Pas de Balanchine\" in Forsythe's \"Jete Woman\" Solo, But a Deep Connection to the Style\n\nIt is not possible to quantify the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015, as \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized ballet step. The term more broadly refers to the distinctive style of choreographer George Balanchine, which profoundly influenced Forsythe's work.\n\nWilliam Forsythe's choreography in \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" is widely acknowledged as an extension and deconstruction of the classical ballet vocabulary established by George Balanchine. Forsythe, who studied at the Balanchine-founded School of American Ballet, took the speed, angularity, and extreme lines of the Balanchine technique and pushed them into a more athletic and aggressive domain. His work is noted for its use of off-balance movements, intricate and rapid footwork, and dynamic, often combative, partnering.\n\nThe \"Jete Woman\" solo, a role originated by the iconic dancer Sylvie Guillem, is a prime example of Forsythe's demanding style. While a specific video of Svetlana Gileva's 2015 performance is not publicly available for a step-by-step analysis, descriptions of the choreography and the role itself confirm that it is a virtuosic display filled with movements characteristic of the Balanchine aesthetic. These include:\n\n*   **Extreme Speed and Athleticism**: The solo is known for its high-energy, fast-paced sequences that require incredible stamina and precision.\n*   **Challenging Classical Technique**: The choreography takes traditional ballet steps and distorts them, pushing them to their physical limits with off-kilter balances and exaggerated lines.\n*   **Signature Poses in a New Context**: Movements that echo the famous Balanchine arabesque line and dynamic \"en dehors\" pirouettes are likely present, but integrated into Forsythe's more contemporary and aggressive framework.\n\nIn essence, the entire \"Jete Woman\" solo can be seen as an embodiment of the Balanchine style, reimagined and intensified. Rather than containing a countable number of specific \"pas de Balanchine,\" the solo is a continuous stream of \"Balanchine-esque\" motion. Therefore, any attempt to provide a numerical count would be misleading. The solo is a testament to the enduring influence of Balanchine on contemporary ballet, as seen through the innovative and challenging lens of William Forsythe.\n\n<<<It is impossible to provide a number because \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal ballet step, but a reference to a style that infuses the entire Jete Woman solo.>>>"
