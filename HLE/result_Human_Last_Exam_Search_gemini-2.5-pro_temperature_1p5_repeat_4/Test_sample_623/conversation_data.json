    "### Two 13C-Labeled CO2 Molecules Released\n\nWhen a molecule of 1,4-13C glucose undergoes complete oxidation through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, a total of two 13C-labeled carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules are released.\n\nThe process begins with glycolysis, where the six-carbon glucose molecule, labeled at its first and fourth carbon atoms, is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The fate of the labeled carbons is as follows:\n\n*   The 13C label on the fourth carbon of glucose is transferred to the carboxyl group of one of the pyruvate molecules. This pyruvate then undergoes oxidative decarboxylation, a reaction that links glycolysis to the Krebs cycle. In this step, the labeled carboxyl group is released as the first molecule of 13CO2 before the remaining two-carbon acetyl-CoA fragment enters the Krebs cycle.\n\n*   The 13C label on the first carbon of glucose ends up on the methyl group of the second pyruvate molecule. This pyruvate is also converted to acetyl-CoA, which then enters the Krebs cycle. However, the carbons from acetyl-CoA are not released as CO2 during the first turn of the cycle. Instead, they are incorporated into the cycle's intermediates. It is only in subsequent turns of the Krebs cycle that this second labeled carbon is eventually released as the second molecule of 13CO2.\n\nTherefore, the complete metabolism of a single molecule of 1,4-13C glucose results in the eventual release of two labeled CO2 molecules.\n\n<<<2>>>"
