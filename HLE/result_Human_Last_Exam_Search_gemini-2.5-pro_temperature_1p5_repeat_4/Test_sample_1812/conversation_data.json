    "The determinant of the given matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis calculated as follows:\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) - (-1) * (-2 - 1) + (-1) * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * (3) + 1 * (-3) - 1 * (3)\ndet(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can observe that the sum of the elements in each row is 0. For example, in the first row, 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0. This property implies that the vector is an eigenvector of the matrix with an eigenvalue of 0. A matrix having 0 as an eigenvalue has a determinant of 0.\n\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" appears to be additional context that is not necessary for the explicit calculation of the determinant of the provided matrix. Research on the Markov quiver shows it is a topic in the study of cluster algebras and is often represented by a graph with three vertices and directed edges. The adjacency matrix of such a quiver can take various forms depending on the specific context and definitions used. However, since the matrix A is explicitly stated, the computation of its determinant is a direct mathematical exercise.\n\n<<<0>>>"
