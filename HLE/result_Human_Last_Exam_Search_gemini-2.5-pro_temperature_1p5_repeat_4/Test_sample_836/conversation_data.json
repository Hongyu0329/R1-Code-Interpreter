    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **Power Spectral Density**.\n\nSpecifically, in the context of neutron noise analysis, two primary methods are used to characterize the statistical fluctuations in neutron populations to infer subcritical reactivity and other important reactor parameters: the Rossi-alpha and Feynman-alpha methods.\n\nThe Rossi-alpha method measures the time correlation between neutron detection events, which is directly related to the generalized pair correlation function in the time domain. The Feynman-alpha method, on the other hand, measures the variance-to-mean ratio of neutron counts in a given time interval. These two methods are intimately related; the Feynman-alpha expression can be derived from a double integration of the Rossi-alpha formula.\n\nWhen the temporal correlation data from a Rossi-alpha type measurement (which represents the pair correlation in time) is subjected to a Fourier transform, the resulting quantity is the auto-power spectral density (APSD) or cross-power spectral density (CPSD) if correlations between two different detectors are considered. This power spectral density represents the contribution of various frequencies to the fluctuations in the neutron population.\n\nTherefore, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is the power spectral density, a fundamental quantity in frequency-based neutron noise analysis techniques.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density>>>"
