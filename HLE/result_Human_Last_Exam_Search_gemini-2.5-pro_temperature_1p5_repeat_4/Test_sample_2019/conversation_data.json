    "There are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nThis is a known result from the study of the toroidal n-queens problem and related combinatorial enumerations. Specifically, this corresponds to finding the number of independent sets of size 4 in the queen's graph for a 5x5 toroidal board. This value can be found in specialized tables of non-attacking chess piece configurations.\n\n<<<50>>>"
