    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of the category of posets $\\mathsf{Pos}$, consists of a pair of order-preserving maps and two 2-morphisms satisfying certain conditions. Let the objects be $[m]$ and $[n]$, which are the finite ordinals $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ and $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ respectively. An adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ involves a pair of 1-morphisms (order-preserving maps) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$.\n\nIn this 2-category, a 2-morphism from a map $f$ to a map $g$ exists if and only if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain. The conditions for an internal adjunction $(L,R)$ are given by the existence of 2-morphisms, which translate to the following inequalities:\n1.  $\\text{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$, which means $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n2.  $L \\circ R \\le \\text{id}_{[n]}$, which means $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThis pair of conditions is equivalent to the definition of a Galois connection between the two posets $[m]$ and $[n]$, where $L$ is the left adjoint and $R$ is the right adjoint. The defining property of such an adjunction can be stated as: for any $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the equivalence $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ holds.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by its left adjoint or its right adjoint.\nAn order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it has a right adjoint. This is the case if and only if $L(0) = 0$.\nDually, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it has a left adjoint. This is the case if and only if it preserves the greatest element, meaning $R(n) = m$.\n\nTherefore, counting the number of internal adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ that satisfy $L(0)=0$.\nFor the specific problem from $$ to $$, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ such that $L(0) = 0$.\n\nSuch a map is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ satisfying:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $L(0)$ is fixed, we only need to determine the values of $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. This is equivalent to choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $38$ elements) with replacement, and arranging them in non-decreasing order. This is a classic combinatorial problem of combinations with repetition. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $p$ items with repetition is given by the multiset coefficient $\\binom{p+k-1}{k}$.\n\nIn this case, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) and $p=38$ (the size of the set of possible values $\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$).\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, one could count the number of right adjoints $R: \\to$ satisfying $R(37) = 23$. This would yield the same result, $\\binom{23+1+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<$ \\binom{60}{23} $>>>"
