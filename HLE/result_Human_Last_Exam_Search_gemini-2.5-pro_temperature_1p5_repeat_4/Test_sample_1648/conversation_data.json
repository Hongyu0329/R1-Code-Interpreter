    "The question of finding the largest natural number *n* for which the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero presents a notable conflict between established mathematical results and the formulation of the question itself, which appears to be from a University of Michigan topology qualifying exam from 2011.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the mathematical consensus on the K-theory of rings of the form Z/p^k:\n\n*   **Decomposition of K-groups**: The algebraic K-groups of Z/27 are finite abelian groups. They can be decomposed into their *l*-primary components for all primes *l*.\n*   **Prime-to-p Torsion**: For a prime *l* different from *p*, the *l*-primary part of the K-groups of Z/p^k is isomorphic to the *l*-primary part of the K-groups of the residue field Z/p.\n*   **K-groups of Finite Fields**: Daniel Quillen's landmark computation shows that for a finite field F_q, the even-dimensional K-groups K_{2n}(F_q) are zero for all *n* ≥ 1.\n*   **Implication for Z/27**: Applying these results to Z/27 (where *p*=3), the *l*-primary part of K_{2n}(Z/27) is zero for all primes *l* ≠ 3. This means that K_{2n}(Z/27) must be a 3-primary group.\n\nThe crucial point is to determine the 3-primary part of K_{2n}(Z/27). Modern results, primarily from the work of Hesselholt and Madsen on topological cyclic homology, provide a formula for these groups. Their work shows that the cyclotomic trace map from algebraic K-theory to topological cyclic homology is an isomorphism for these rings, allowing for explicit computation.\n\nThe established formula for the p-primary part of the even K-groups is:\n\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)_p \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(n!)}$\n\nwhere v_p(n!) is the p-adic valuation of *n* factorial (the exponent of *p* in the prime factorization of *n*!).\n\nFor the specific case of Z/27, we have *p*=3 and *k*=3. The 3-primary part of the K-groups is therefore:\n\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3^{v_3(n!)}$\n\nLet's analyze the exponent v_3(n!) for a few values of *n*:\n*   For *n* = 1, v_3(1!) = 0, so K_2(Z/27) is the trivial group.\n*   For *n* = 2, v_3(2!) = 0, so K_4(Z/27) is the trivial group.\n*   For *n* = 3, v_3(3!) = 1, so K_6(Z/27) contains a subgroup isomorphic to Z/3 and is therefore nonzero.\n*   For all *n* ≥ 3, the value of v_3(n!) = &lfloor;n/3&rfloor; + &lfloor;n/9&rfloor; + ... is at least 1 and grows with *n*.\n\nThis means the group K_{2n}(Z/27) is nonzero for all natural numbers *n* ≥ 3. Consequently, based on the current understanding of algebraic K-theory, there is no largest natural number *n* for which this group is nonzero. The question, as stated, appears to be flawed.\n\n<<<There is no largest natural number n.>>>"
