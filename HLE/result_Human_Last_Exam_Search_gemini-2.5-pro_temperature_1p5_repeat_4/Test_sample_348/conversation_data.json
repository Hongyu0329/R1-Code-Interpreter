    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium point, which is where the supply and demand curves intersect.\n\n**1. Defining the Functions**\n\n*   **Supply Function:** P = ln(Qₛ³ - 2)\n    *   For this function to be defined, the argument of the logarithm must be positive: Qₛ³ - 2 > 0, which means Qₛ > ∛2 ≈ 1.2599.\n*   **Demand Function:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Qₐ))\n\n**2. Finding Market Equilibrium**\n\nEquilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied (Qₛ) equals the quantity demanded (Qₐ) at the same price (P). We set the two equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity (Qe).\n\nln(Qe³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Qe))\n\nThis equation cannot be solved algebraically and requires numerical methods. By using a numerical solver, we find the equilibrium quantity to be:\n\nQe ≈ 4.8516\n\nWe can then find the equilibrium price (Pe) by substituting Qe into either the supply or demand function. Using the demand function:\n\nPe = 18e^(-arctan(4.8516)) ≈ 4.6293\n\n**3. Calculating Total Welfare**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS).\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from Q = 0 to Qe.\n    CS = ∫[0 to Qe] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (Qe * Pe)\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price, from the minimum supply quantity (∛2) to Qe.\n    PS = (Qe * Pe) - ∫[∛2 to Qe] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nWhen we sum these to find the total welfare (TW), the `Qe * Pe` terms cancel out:\n\nTW = CS + PS = ∫[0 to Qe] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[∛2 to Qe] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\n**4. Numerical Integration**\n\nWe must calculate the value of these definite integrals numerically:\n\n*   **Integral of the demand function:**\n    ∫[0 to 4.8516] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ ≈ 37.8924\n\n*   **Integral of the supply function:**\n    ∫[∛2 to 4.8516] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ ≈ 12.3952\n\nSubtracting the second integral from the first gives the total welfare:\n\nTotal Welfare ≈ 37.8924 - 12.3952 = 25.4972\n\n<<<25.4972>>>"
