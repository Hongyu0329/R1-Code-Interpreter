    "I have conducted extensive research into the historical records of Bártfa (now Bardejov) to identify the judge in the year 1461. While the search confirms that Bártfa, as a free royal town, had its own elected judge and town council during this period, and a letter from 1461 is known to have been addressed to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa\", the specific name of the judge for that year does not appear in the readily available historical documents and scholarly articles.\n\nHistorical records from this era, including town chronicles and administrative documents, often have gaps or have not been fully digitized or transcribed in a searchable format. Although there are mentions of town officials from periods close to 1461, such as György Stenzl who was a town judge in the early 16th century, the name of the individual holding this position in 1461 remains elusive in the sources consulted.\n\nTherefore, based on the currently accessible information, it is not possible to definitively name the judge of Bártfa in 1461.\n\n<<<I was unable to find the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.>>>"
