    "There are two Cysteine residues located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor, rho 1 subunit (GABAAρ1), is identified by the UniProt accession number P24046. According to the annotations in the UniProt database, the topology of this protein includes four transmembrane (TM) domains.\n\nThe transmembrane domains are located at the following amino acid positions:\n*   **TM1:** 281-301\n*   **TM2:** 305-325\n*   **TM3:** 340-360\n*   **TM4:** 452-472\n\nThe region connecting the third and fourth transmembrane domains, known as the TM3-TM4 linker, is an intracellular loop. This linker spans from the end of TM3 to the beginning of TM4. Based on the UniProt data, this corresponds to the amino acid sequence from position 361 to 451.\n\nThe amino acid sequence for this TM3-TM4 linker region is as follows:\nKIRTPNLHPQDRLLRPDAPPPKARLIFPSRAGPRLPRAHGPGVPGPAPRAPGPAVGIKLRMH**CC**PARIVEAQMPRSTSASRATSAAMAHEETHAVSWKLPYPMVPPRAVSRNIPSFQIVYFWLFWFNFVLIYLNTMMVQRA\n\nBy examining this sequence, two Cysteine (C) residues can be identified at positions 424 and 425.\n\n<<<2>>>"
