    "From the search results, I can confirm the following:\n\n*   **Gamut:** ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a significantly wider color gamut than sRGB. This means ROMM RGB can represent colors that sRGB cannot.\n*   **Out-of-Gamut Colors:** When converting from a wide-gamut space like ROMM RGB to a smaller one like sRGB, some colors will be \"out-of-gamut\". These out-of-gamut colors will be clipped or mapped to the nearest color within the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conversion:** Converting from ROMM RGB to sRGB involves a matrix transformation. If the resulting sRGB values for any channel (R, G, or B) are outside the normalized range (e.g., negative or greater than 1), the original color is outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Primary Colors:** The primary colors of a wide-gamut space (like pure green or pure blue) are often the ones that fall outside a smaller gamut.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each color based on this understanding. I don't need a precise calculator, as the question is conceptual and the primary colors are the most likely candidates to be out-of-gamut.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1) - Pure Blue in ROMM RGB:** The blue primary of the ROMM RGB space is known to be much more saturated than the sRGB blue primary. When converted to sRGB, this highly saturated blue will result in out-of-range values (specifically, a negative red value) to represent its chromaticity, meaning it cannot be represented by sRGB.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0) - Pure Green in ROMM RGB:** Similar to the blue primary, the green primary in ROMM RGB is far outside the sRGB gamut. Its chromaticity is beyond what sRGB can display. Therefore, it cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6) - A desaturated blue-green:** This color is a mix and is not at the edge of the ROMM RGB gamut. While it's a saturated color, it is much more likely to fall within the sRGB gamut than the pure primaries.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) - A desaturated color:** This is a muted, grayish-blue color. Colors with values that are closer to each other and away from the extremes (0 and 1) are generally less saturated and very likely to be within the sRGB gamut.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1) - White:** The white point is a fundamental reference for both color spaces. Although they use different standard illuminants (D50 for ROMM RGB and D65 for sRGB), the conversion process includes chromatic adaptation to align the white points. Therefore, pure white (1, 1, 1) in ROMM RGB will convert to pure white (1, 1, 1) in sRGB.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pure blue and pure green primaries of ROMM RGB are outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n1, 2\n<<<1, 2>>>"
