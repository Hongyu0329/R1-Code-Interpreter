    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is a classic example of an E2 elimination reaction, where stereochemistry dictates the outcome. The product of this reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, which is a strong, sterically bulky base. This combination strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction pathway.\n*   **E2 Reaction Requirements**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the hydrogen atom to be removed and the leaving group (in this case, bromine) must be in an anti-periplanar position. In a cyclohexane ring, this translates to both groups being in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n*   **Conformational Analysis**: To react, the (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane molecule must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position. The more stable chair conformation of this molecule has the bromine in an equatorial position and the methyl group in an axial position. This conformer is unreactive for E2 elimination.\n*   The molecule must first ring-flip to a less stable conformation, which places the bromine atom in an axial position and the methyl group in an equatorial position. This is the only conformation from which the E2 reaction can proceed.\n*   **Identification of Anti-Periplanar Hydrogens**: In this reactive conformation (with the axial bromine), we must look for axial hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2**: The hydrogen is in an equatorial position, *syn-periplanar* to the axial bromine. It cannot be eliminated via the E2 mechanism.\n    *   **At C6**: There is a hydrogen atom that is axial and anti-periplanar to the bromine atom.\n*   **Product Formation**: Because only the axial hydrogen on C6 can be eliminated, the double bond can only form between C1 and C6. This exclusivity means that Zaitsev's rule (which predicts the more substituted alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene) and Hofmann's rule (which favors the less substituted alkene) are superseded by the strict stereochemical demands of the E2 mechanism. The only possible product is the less substituted alkene.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemical constraints of the molecule only allow for the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
