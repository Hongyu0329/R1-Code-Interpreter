There is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize the catalytic performance in both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS), as the optimal ratio is reaction-dependent. For the WGS reaction, a Ni content in the range of 2.5-7 molar % is generally considered optimal. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5 being suggested for HER in one study, while for OER, the atomic dispersion of Ni is more critical than a specific bulk ratio.
