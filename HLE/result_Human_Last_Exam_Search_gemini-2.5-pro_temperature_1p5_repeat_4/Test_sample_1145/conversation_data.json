    "### Probability for a Particle in a 1D Box is Approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nFor a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a', the probability of finding it within the small interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the first excited state (n=2) is approximately 0.00000658, or about 0.000658%.\n\nThe state n=2 is the first excited state for the particle. A key feature of this state is the presence of a node at the exact center of the box (x = 0.5a). A node is a point where the wave function, and therefore the probability of finding the particle, is zero. Because the specified interval is centered around this node, the probability is expected to be very small.\n\nTo determine the precise probability, one must integrate the probability density, which is the square of the wave function, over the given interval.\n\nThe wave function for the n=2 state is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability (P) is calculated by the integral of the probability density |ψ₂(x)|² from x = 0.495a to x = 0.505a:\n\nP = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nSolving this integral yields:\n\nP = (1/2π) [0.02π - sin(0.02π)]\n\nUsing the value of π, this expression evaluates to approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶. This confirms the very low, but non-zero, probability of finding the particle in this small region surrounding the node.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
