    "The most common and efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas. This synthesis is typically conducted by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, often in a 1:5 molar ratio, in a sealed nickel vessel. The nickel container is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel fluoride, which prevents corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nThis reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of 400°C and a pressure of about 6 atmospheres. Research and patents specify a temperature range between 350°C and 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred and optimal temperature for an efficient, nearly quantitative yield. Temperature control is crucial, as lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂), while higher temperatures favor xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). While other synthesis methods exist, such as using an electric discharge at low temperatures, they often result in significant impurities. Therefore, the thermal method at 400°C is widely cited as the standard for efficient production.\n\n<<<B>>>"
