The appropriate management for this patient involves not replanting the avulsed teeth due to the 28-hour delay. The immediate priorities are to manage her uncontrolled diabetes and address the empty tooth sockets. A removable partial denture is the recommended initial prosthetic solution.

Specifically:
- **Immediate Care:**
  - Medical consultation to manage her diabetes (HbA1c of 7.5%).
  - Gentle cleaning of the tooth sockets.
- **Prosthetic Choice:**
  - **Type:** A Kennedy Class III removable partial denture.
  - **Material:** A flexible thermoplastic resin (nylon) for better aesthetics and comfort.
  - **Abutment Teeth:** The left maxillary central incisor and the left maxillary second premolar.
    - **Reasoning:** These teeth are adjacent to the missing tooth space and will provide the necessary support and retention for the denture.
- **Cells of Interest:**
  - Primarily periodontal ligament (PDL) stem cells, fibroblasts, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts, which are crucial for healing and the processes of resorption and ankylosis that are expected with delayed replantation.

The patient's skeletal Class III condition (SNB of 88Â°) will need to be considered when setting up the denture teeth to achieve a functional and aesthetic outcome.
