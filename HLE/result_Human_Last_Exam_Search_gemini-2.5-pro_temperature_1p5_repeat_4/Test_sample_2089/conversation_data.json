    "I have conducted multiple searches for an Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus. These searches included looking for films with pivotal bus scenes, famous last words in movies, and specific plot details involving buses and fatal outcomes.\n\nThe investigation into Oscar-nominated films with significant bus-related plots, such as \"The Sweet Hereafter,\" \"Watu Wote/All of Us,\" and \"Midnight Cowboy,\" did not yield a scene that matches the user's description. The plots of these films revolve around a bus crash, a hijacking, and a character's death on a bus, respectively, but none feature the specific dialogue and consequence as described.\n\nFurther searches for lists of ironic or surprising film deaths and scenes with fateful last words did not provide any leads to an Oscar-nominated film with the described scenario.\n\nBased on the extensive research conducted, there is no evidence to suggest that such a scene exists in an Oscar-nominated film. It is possible that the user may be thinking of a film that was not Oscar-nominated, or is recalling the details of the scene differently.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify an Oscar-nominated film that matches the described scene.>>>"
