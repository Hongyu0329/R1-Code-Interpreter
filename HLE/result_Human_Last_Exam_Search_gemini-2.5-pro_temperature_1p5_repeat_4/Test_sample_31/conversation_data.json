    "To fully identify the PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube while using the CFOP method, a minimum of **five** non-top-facing stickers must be seen.\n\nIt is a common and established technique for speedcubers to recognize the specific PLL case by only looking at the stickers on two adjacent sides of the top layer. Viewing two adjacent faces reveals a total of six non-top-facing stickers: two on each of the two corner pieces and one on each of the two edge pieces.\n\nHowever, not all six of these stickers are necessary for a full identification. The concept of \"2-Sided PLL Recognition\" demonstrates that all 21 PLL cases can be distinguished using the information from these two faces. Further optimization, known as Straughan Recognition, has shown that one of these stickers is redundant. The reason for this is that with the top-layer color already known, seeing two side-facing stickers on a single corner piece is enough to determine its identity and orientation completely. Therefore, the third visible sticker on that corner piece provides no new information.\n\nThus, by observing one sticker on one corner, two on another corner, and one on each of the two adjacent edge pieces (a total of five stickers), a solver can deduce the exact permutation of the last layer and execute the correct algorithm.\n\n<<<5>>>"
