    "Based on a detailed analysis of the reverse turn technique in each of the specified ballroom dances, the dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the fundamental technique is the European Tango.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning for each dance:\n\n*   **Viennese Waltz:** While overturning a reverse turn to navigate a corner is considered very difficult and not standard practice, it is technically described as possible, albeit challenging. The technique focuses on the difficulty rather than an outright prohibition.\n*   **English Waltz:** The technique of the English Waltz allows for variations in the amount of turn to achieve different alignments on the dance floor. Figures such as the \"overturned spin turn\" exist, indicating that overturning is a recognized technical variation.\n*   **Slow Foxtrot:** In Slow Foxtrot, while precision in the amount of turn is a key technical aspect, the existence of overturned variations of other figures and the use of varying amounts of turn in amalgamations suggest that overturning is not technically impossible.\n*   **Quickstep:** The technique of Quickstep explicitly includes overturned figures, such as the \"overturned Progressive Chass√©\" and \"overturned V6\", which are used to change alignment and connect different patterns.\n*   **European Tango:** The technique for the Open Reverse Turn in Tango dictates that on the third step, as the lady steps outside the partner, the man should not turn. This creates the characteristic look and feel of the dance. Continuing to turn to the left during this step to create an overturn would result in an incorrect shape and violate this core principle of the figure's technique. This makes it impossible to properly execute an overturned reverse turn without disregarding this essential technical element.\n\n<<<C>>>"
