I am unable to find a Hollywood feature film from a major studio that precisely matches the description of a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car. While the movie *The Goonies* features a teenager on a pink bike in a scene with a car, it does not depict the specific act of pedaling towards it.
