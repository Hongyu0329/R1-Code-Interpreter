    "The extensive search for a Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio depicting a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car has not yielded a definitive match matching all the specific criteria.\n\nSeveral films feature some of the requested elements, but none contain the exact sequence of events as described.\n\nIn the 1985 film *The Goonies*, produced by Warner Bros., the teenage character Brand does ride a younger girl's small pink bicycle in a comedic chase sequence. In the scene, he is pursued by the antagonist, Troy, who is in a car. Troy grabs Brand and drags him alongside the vehicle before releasing him, causing Brand to veer off the road. However, Brand does not pedal directly toward the oncoming car in an act of defiance.\n\nSearches for scenes involving teenagers \"playing chicken\" with cars on bicycles or other forms of vehicular confrontation in major Hollywood films have not identified a scene that includes a pink bicycle. The query remains unfulfilled based on available information.\n\n<<<I am unable to find a Hollywood feature film from a major studio that precisely matches the description of a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car. While the movie *The Goonies* features a teenager on a pink bike in a scene with a car, it does not depict the specific act of pedaling towards it.>>>"
