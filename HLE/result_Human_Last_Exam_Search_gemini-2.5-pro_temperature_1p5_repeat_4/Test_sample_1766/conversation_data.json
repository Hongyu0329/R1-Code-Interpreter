    "To solve for the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $J_z$, for a p-electron, we must first determine the relevant quantum numbers.\n\nA p-electron is characterized by an orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l* = 1, and as it is an electron, it has a spin quantum number, *s* = 1/2. The total angular momentum, **J**, is the sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta, **J** = **L** + **S**. The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan series, which states that *j* can take values from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\n\nFor the p-electron:\n*   The minimum value of *j* is |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.\n*   The maximum value of *j* is 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number are *j* = 1/2 and *j* = 3/2.\n\n### Eigenvalues of J²\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula ħ²*j*(*j* + 1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   For the state with **j = 1/2**, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\n    ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = ħ² * (1/2) * (3/2) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n\n*   For the state with **j = 3/2**, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\n    ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = ħ² * (3/2) * (5/2) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n\n### Eigenvalues of Jz\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by the formula ħ*m_j, where m_j can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\n*   For the state with **j = 1/2**, the possible values for m_j are -1/2 and +1/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n    *   **-1/2 ħ**\n    *   **+1/2 ħ**\n\n*   For the state with **j = 3/2**, the possible values for m_j are -3/2, -1/2, +1/2, and +3/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n    *   **-3/2 ħ**\n    *   **-1/2 ħ**\n    *   **+1/2 ħ**\n    *   **+3/2 ħ**\n\n### Summary of Common Eigenvalues\n\nThe common eigenvalues are the sets of eigenvalues that can be simultaneously measured for the commuting operators $J^2$ and $J_z$. These are grouped by the value of the total angular momentum quantum number *j*.\n\n**For the j = 1/2 state (doublet):**\n*   The single eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(3/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **-1/2 ħ** and **+1/2 ħ**.\n\n**For the j = 3/2 state (quartet):**\n*   The single eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(15/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **-3/2 ħ**, **-1/2 ħ**, **+1/2 ħ**, and **+3/2 ħ**.\n\n<<<For a p-electron, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number are *j* = 1/2 and *j* = 3/2.\n\nFor the *j* = 1/2 state, the common eigenvalues are:\n*   Eigenvalue of J²: (3/4)ħ²\n*   Eigenvalues of Jz: -1/2 ħ, +1/2 ħ\n\nFor the *j* = 3/2 state, the common eigenvalues are:\n*   Eigenvalue of J²: (15/4)ħ²\n*   Eigenvalues of Jz: -3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, +1/2 ħ, +3/2 ħ>>>"
