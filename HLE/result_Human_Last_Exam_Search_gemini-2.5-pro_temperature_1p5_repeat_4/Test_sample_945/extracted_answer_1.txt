For an oversteering vehicle, the critical speed \(v_{crit}\) at which the linear lateral dynamics become unstable is given by the formula:

\( v_{crit} = \sqrt{\frac{c_f c_r (a+b)^2}{m(bc_r - ac_f)}} \)

Where:
*   \(a\) = distance between the center of gravity (CG) and the front axle
*   \(b\) = distance between CG and the rear axle
*   \(c_f\) = cornering stiffness of the front axle
*   \(c_r\) = cornering stiffness of the rear axle
*   \(m\) = vehicle mass
*   \(I\) = vehicle moment of inertia about the vertical axis

This formula is valid under the condition for oversteer, which is \( bc_r > ac_f \). This ensures that the term in the denominator is positive, yielding a real-valued speed.
