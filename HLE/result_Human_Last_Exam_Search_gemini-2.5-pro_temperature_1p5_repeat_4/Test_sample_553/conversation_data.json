    "The Beatles song \"Michelle,\" from their 1965 album *Rubber Soul*, features a notable and sophisticated opening chord sequence. The song is in the key of F minor, but it famously begins with an F major chord, creating a striking harmonic effect.\n\nThe introductory chord progression is as follows: Fm - Eaug - Ab/Eb - Dm7b5 - Dbmaj7 - C.\n\nTherefore, the song starts on the tonic (F), but as a major chord instead of the expected minor, and then moves to an augmented chord built on E. It does not feature a direct jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n\n<<<\"Michelle\">>>"
