    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are part of the palliovisceral lobe complex. This complex is a component of the subesophageal mass, which controls various motor functions.\n\nThe specific lobes located posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe within this complex are the:\n\n*   **Posterior chromatophore lobes:** As their name suggests, these lobes are situated towards the rear of the palliovisceral lobe. They are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) and papillae (skin texture muscles) on the mantle, fin, and the visceral mass. The mantle is the main, posterior part of the cuttlefish's body.\n\nOther lobes that are part of the palliovisceral lobe complex and are located in the posterior region of the subesophageal mass include:\n\n*   **Fin lobes:** These are involved in the movement of the fins.\n*   **Dorsal and Ventral vasomotor lobes:** These lobes are also components of the palliovisceral lobe complex.\n\nA comprehensive 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish has been created, which helps in identifying the spatial relationships between these different brain lobes. The entire brain is encased in a cartilaginous cranium, with the palliovisceral lobe complex forming part of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n\nIn summary, the primary brain regions adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the vasomotor lobes.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent and posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes.>>>"
