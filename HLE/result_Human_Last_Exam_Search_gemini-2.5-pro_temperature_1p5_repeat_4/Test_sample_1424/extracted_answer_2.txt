In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, exhibits an inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. In the frequency-momentum representation, this relationship is expressed as:

**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ)**

where ħω is the particle's energy, and iδ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that ensures causality. The poles of G_0 in the complex energy plane directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k.
