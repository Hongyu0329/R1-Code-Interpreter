    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G_0, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is most transparent in the energy-momentum (or frequency-wavevector) representation.\n\nThe bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) for a single particle with wavevector k and frequency (energy) ω is given by the following expression:\n\n**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ)**\n\nHere:\n*   **ħω** represents the energy of the particle.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue corresponding to the momentum eigenstate k. This value is determined by the dispersion relation of the non-interacting system, which is derived from the single-particle Hamiltonian, H_0.\n*   **iδ** is a small imaginary term in the denominator, where δ is a positive infinitesimal. This term is crucial for ensuring causality, meaning that the particle propagates forward in time. It dictates how the poles of the Green's function are handled in the complex frequency plane.\n\nThis functional form directly illustrates the relationship between the propagator and the energy spectrum of the non-interacting system. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane occur precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This fundamental relationship is a cornerstone of many-body theory, providing the starting point for perturbative expansions and the calculation of interacting Green's functions through the Dyson equation.\n\nWithin the Feynman path integral formalism, G_0 is calculated as the two-point correlation function in the absence of any interaction terms in the action. The path integral provides a method to derive this propagator, and the resulting expression in the frequency domain reveals this inverse dependence on the difference between the particle's energy and its allowed energy eigenvalues.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, exhibits an inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k.
