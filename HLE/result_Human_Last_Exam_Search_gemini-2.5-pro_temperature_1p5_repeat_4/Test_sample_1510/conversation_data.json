    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on the symmetries within the pattern; there are exactly 17 such groups. Each wallpaper group is associated with a point group, which describes the symmetries of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed, such as rotations and reflections.\n\nThe order of a point group refers to the total number of its distinct symmetry operations. A point group of order 2 contains two operations: the identity operation and either a single reflection or a single 180-degree rotation. The point groups of order 2 found in the wallpaper groups are C₂ (consisting of the identity and a 180° rotation) and D₁ (consisting of the identity and a reflection).\n\nThe four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group's point group is C₂. Its symmetries consist of translations and 180-degree rotations.\n*   **pm**: This group has the point group D₁. Its symmetries include reflections across parallel axes.\n*   **pg**: This group also has the point group D₁. Its key feature is the presence of glide reflections.\n*   **cm**: This group's point group is D₁. It contains reflections and glide reflections.\n\nOther wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders. For instance, `p1` has a point group of order 1, while `pmm` and `pgg` have point groups of order 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
