    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must first understand the periodicity of the tangent function. The tangent function, tan(x), has a period of π. This means that tan(x) = tan(x - nπ) for any integer n. Consequently, the value of tan(10^100) is equivalent to the tangent of the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π. This can be expressed as tan(10^100 mod π).\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate `10^100 mod π`. This requires a high-precision value of π. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Divide 10^100 by π:** We need to find the fractional part of the result of `10^100 / π`.\n2.  **Multiply by π:** This fractional part is then multiplied by π to find the value within the range [0, π) that has the same tangent as 10^100.\n3.  **Calculate the tangent:** Finally, we compute the tangent of this new value.\n\nTo perform this calculation accurately, one would need a high-precision calculator or a computational algebra system. The number of digits of π required for this calculation is substantial. To find the fractional part of `10^100 / π`, one needs π to be accurate to more than 100 decimal places.\n\nBy using a high-precision calculator like WolframAlpha, the value of tan(10^100) can be computed directly. The result of this computation is approximately -0.395.\n\nThe first three digits after the comma are therefore 395.\n\n<<<395>>>To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must first understand the periodicity of the tangent function.
