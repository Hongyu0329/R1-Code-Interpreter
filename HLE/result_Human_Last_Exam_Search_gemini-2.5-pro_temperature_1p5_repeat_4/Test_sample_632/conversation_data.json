    "Based on extensive research, there is no evidence of a unique architectural feature being removed from the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in 1950. Historical records and photographs of the square do not indicate any specific removal or demolition in that particular year.\n\nThe piazza has undergone numerous transformations throughout its history. Significant changes include:\n\n*   The demolition of medieval sheds, stalls, and small shops that cluttered the square, a process that began in the 15th century and continued under various popes to give the piazza a more open feel.\n*   The addition of the central fountain, the Fontana del Pantheon, designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1575.\n*   The erection of the Egyptian obelisk on top of the fountain in 1711 under Pope Clement XI.\n*   The removal of the famous twin bell towers, often derisively called the \"ass's ears,\" from the Pantheon's facade between 1881 and 1883. These were perhaps the most significant architectural features to be removed from the immediate vicinity of the Pantheon in modern times, though well before 1950.\n*   A plan by Napoleon in the early 19th century to demolish buildings around the Pantheon was proposed but never carried out.\n\nWhile there were demolitions in Rome during the Fascist era and post-World War II, none of the available sources mention a specific architectural element being taken away from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. It is possible the date in the query is inaccurate, referring to one of the earlier, well-documented removals.\n\n<<<There is no record of a unique architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. The most notable removal of an architectural feature in the modern era was the demolition of the twin bell towers from the Pantheon in the late 19th century.>>>"
