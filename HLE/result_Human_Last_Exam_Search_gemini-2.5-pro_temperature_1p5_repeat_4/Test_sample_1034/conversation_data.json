    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions under which a triangle can have two possible values for a third side, given two sides and a non-included angle. This is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines.\n\nLet the sides of triangle $A B C$ be $a, b, c$ opposite to angles $A, B, C$ respectively.\nWe are given:\n*   $a = BC = S = SNYWR$\n*   $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B=30^{\\circ}$\n*   The side in question is $b = AC$.\n\nThe problem states that for a certain value of $AC$, there are two possible values for side length $AB$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the value of $S$ from $SNYWR$. In mathematical puzzles, when a string of letters is given as a value, it often implies a substitution cipher. A common method is to sum the alphabetical positions of the letters (A=1, B=2, etc.).\n\n*   S = 19\n*   N = 14\n*   Y = 25\n*   W = 23\n*   R = 18\n\nAdding these values gives:\n$S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99$.\nSo, we have $BC = 99$.\n\nNow, we apply the Law of Sines to triangle $A B C$:\n$\\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{a}{\\sin A}$\n$\\frac{AC}{\\sin 30^{\\circ}} = \\frac{99}{\\sin A}$\n\nThis can be rearranged to find $\\sin A$:\n$\\sin A = \\frac{99 \\cdot \\sin 30^{\\circ}}{AC}$\nSince $\\sin 30^{\\circ} = 0.5$, the equation becomes:\n$\\sin A = \\frac{99 \\cdot 0.5}{AC} = \\frac{49.5}{AC}$\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles (and thus two possible lengths for side $AB$), there must be two possible values for angle $A$. This occurs if and only if $0 < \\sin A < 1$.\n\n1.  $\\sin A > 0$: $\\frac{49.5}{AC} > 0$. Since $AC$ is a side length, it must be positive, so this condition is always met.\n\n2.  $\\sin A < 1$: $\\frac{49.5}{AC} < 1$, which implies $AC > 49.5$.\n\nAdditionally, for the second (obtuse) angle $A_2 = 180^{\\circ} - A_1$ to be valid in a triangle, the sum of $A_2$ and angle $B$ must be less than $180^{\\circ}$.\n$A_2 + B < 180^{\\circ}$\n$(180^{\\circ} - A_1) + 30^{\\circ} < 180^{\\circ}$\n$210^{\\circ} - A_1 < 180^{\\circ}$\n$30^{\\circ} < A_1$\n\nSince $A_1$ is an acute angle, this is equivalent to $\\sin 30^{\\circ} < \\sin A_1$.\n$0.5 < \\frac{49.5}{AC}$\n$AC \\cdot 0.5 < 49.5$\n$AC < 99$\n\nCombining the two conditions for $AC$, we get:\n$49.5 < AC < 99$\n\nThe problem asks for the number of integer values of $AC$ in this interval. The possible integer values for $AC$ are those strictly greater than 49.5 and strictly less than 99.\n*   The smallest integer value is 50.\n*   The largest integer value is 98.\n\nTo find the number of integers in this inclusive range, we calculate:\nNumber of values = (Last Value) - (First Value) + 1\nNumber of values = $98 - 50 + 1 = 49$.\n\nThere are 49 integer values for the length of side $AC$ for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<49>>>"
