    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF, followed by treatment with methyl iodide, yields N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nThis transformation occurs via a two-step process:\n\n1.  **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM):** The first step involves the deprotonation of the aromatic ring at a position ortho to the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt2). The combination of sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi), a strong base, and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), a chelating agent, facilitates this process. The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is a powerful directing metalation group (DMG), guiding the lithium to one of its adjacent (ortho) positions. In this specific molecule, there are two potential ortho positions: C2 and C6. The dimethylamino group at the C3 position also acts as a directing group, albeit a weaker one than the amide. The combined electronic and chelating effects of both groups favor lithiation at the C2 position, which is located between the two directing groups. This regioselectivity is a common feature in systems with 1,3-disposed directing groups.\n\n2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with methyl iodide (an electrophile). The negatively charged carbon atom on the aromatic ring attacks the methyl group of the methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond. This results in the substitution of the lithium atom with a methyl group at the C2 position.\n\nTherefore, the final product is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
