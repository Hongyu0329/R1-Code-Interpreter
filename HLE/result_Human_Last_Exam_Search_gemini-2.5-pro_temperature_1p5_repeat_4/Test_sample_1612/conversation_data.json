    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there are two types of Triple Crowns a player can win: one for hitting and one for pitching. The number of winners for each is distinct.\n\n**Batting Triple Crown:**\nA hitter wins the Triple Crown by leading their league in three key statistical categories in a single season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs). In the history of the American and National Leagues, a total of **10 players** have accomplished this feat, with two of them achieving it twice. This brings the total number of batting Triple Crowns to 12 since RBIs became an official statistic in 1920.\n\nThe most recent player to win the batting Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012 while playing for the Detroit Tigers. This was a significant achievement as it was the first time a player had won the Triple Crown in 45 years. Other notable players to have won the batting Triple Crown include Ted Williams and Rogers Hornsby, who both won it twice, as well as Mickey Mantle, Lou Gehrig, and Frank Robinson.\n\nIncluding achievements from before RBIs were an official statistic in 1920, the number of winners is slightly higher, with players like Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie also on the list. Additionally, research has recognized winners from the Negro Leagues, including Oscar Charleston and Josh Gibson, who each won it twice.\n\n**Pitching Triple Crown:**\nA pitcher achieves the Triple Crown by leading their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA) in the same season. This feat has been accomplished 39 times in the American and National Leagues.\n\nLegendary pitchers such as Grover Cleveland Alexander, Walter Johnson, and Sandy Koufax each won the pitching Triple Crown three times. The most recent pitchers to accomplish this were Chris Sale and Tarik Skubal in 2024. In total, 24 different pitchers have won the pitching Triple Crown in MLB history.\n\n<<<34>>>"
