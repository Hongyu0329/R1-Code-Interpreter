    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide is a variation of the Pummerer rearrangement. This reaction leads to the formation of an α-cyano sulfide. The widely accepted IUPAC name for this product is **(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile**.\n\n### Reaction Mechanism:\nThe reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide:** The oxygen atom of methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride (Tf₂O). This forms a triflyloxysulfonium salt, [PhS⁺(OTf)Me], making the sulfur substituent an excellent leaving group.\n2.  **Formation of a thionium ion:** A base removes a proton from the methyl group, which is now highly acidic. The subsequent elimination of triflic acid (TfOH) generates a reactive intermediate called a thionium ion, [Ph-S=CH₂]⁺.\n3.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) serves as a source for the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻). The cyanide ion then attacks the electrophilic carbon of the thionium ion.\n\nThis sequence results in the product (phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile (Ph-S-CH₂-CN).\n\n### Alternative Nomenclature:\nWhile (phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile is a correct and widely used name, other acceptable names for the product C₈H₇NS include:\n*   2-(Phenylthio)ethanenitrile.\n*   (Phenylthio)acetonitrile.\n*   2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile.\n\nThe compound is also identified by its CAS Number 5219-61-4.\n\nInterestingly, a related reaction known as an \"interrupted Pummerer reaction\" can occur under similar conditions. In this variation, the cyanide nucleophile attacks the sulfur atom of the activated sulfoxide intermediate, leading to dealkylation and the formation of a thiocyanate (Ph-SCN) instead. However, the formation of the α-cyano sulfide via trapping of the thionium ion is the classic Pummerer pathway.\n\n<<<2-(Phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile>>>"
