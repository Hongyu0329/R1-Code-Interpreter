    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `abcdefg`. The stability and oligomerization of coiled-coils are primarily driven by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions of this repeat.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nThe key to deciphering the heptad repeat is to locate the hydrophobic core residues that must occupy the `a` and `d` positions. The hydrophobic residues in the given sequence are I, A, L, and W. The `a` and `d` positions are separated by two residues (`a` -> b -> c -> `d`).\n\nLet's test possible alignments (\"phasings\") of the `abcdefg` repeat on the sequence:\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nIf we assume the common `EIA` motif corresponds to positions `bca`, `cda`, or similar, we often end up with polar or charged residues (like K, E, Q) in the hydrophobic `a` and `d` core positions, which is energetically unfavorable.\n\nA chemically plausible phasing is achieved when Alanine (A) and Leucine (L) form the hydrophobic core. This occurs if we assign position `a` to A(4) and position `d` to L(7).\n\nLet's map the entire sequence with this phasing:\n`e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f`\n`G E I **A** Q S **L** K E I **A** K S **L** K E I **A** W S **L** K E I **A** Q S **L** K G`\n\nThis yields the following residues at the core `a` and `d` positions for the four complete heptads:\n*   **Heptad 1:** `a` = A(4), `d` = L(7)\n*   **Heptad 2:** `a` = A(11), `d` = L(14)\n*   **Heptad 3:** `a` = A(18), `d` = L(21)\n*   **Heptad 4:** `a` = A(25), `d` = L(28)\n\nSo, we have a consistent pattern where all `a` positions are occupied by **Alanine (A)** and all `d` positions are occupied by **Leucine (L)**. The large hydrophobic Tryptophan (W) at position 19 falls into the `b` position, which is exposed to the solvent, an acceptable location.\n\n### 2. Predicting Oligomeric State from Core Residues\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is a strong determinant of the oligomeric state:\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically favored by an `a=I, d=L` (Isoleucine at `a`, Leucine at `d`) pattern. Polar residues like asparagine at the `a` position also strongly promote dimerization.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored by a more even distribution of Isoleucine and Leucine, or by having Isoleucine at both the `a` and `d` positions.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Often results from a reversed `a=L, d=I` pattern.\n\nOur sequence has an `a=A, d=L` pattern. Alanine (A) is a small, non-bulky hydrophobic residue. Leucine (L) is a larger hydrophobic residue. This pattern resembles the `a=I, d=L` rule for dimers, where the `a` position residue is sterically less demanding or smaller than the `d` position residue. The smaller \"knob\" (Alanine) from one helix fits efficiently into the \"hole\" created by the residues surrounding the `d` position on the partner helix. This efficient knobs-into-holes packing is characteristic of a two-stranded, parallel coiled-coil (dimer). A higher-order structure like a trimer or tetramer would likely be less stable due to the small size of Alanine creating packing defects (cavities) in the hydrophobic core.\n\nBased on the understanding of knobs-into-holes interactions and the established patterns for oligomerization, the `a=A, d=L` repeat strongly suggests a dimeric state.\n\nTherefore, the predicted oligomeric state is 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
