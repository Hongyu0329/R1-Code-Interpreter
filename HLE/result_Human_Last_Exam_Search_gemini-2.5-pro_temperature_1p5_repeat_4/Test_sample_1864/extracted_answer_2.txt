For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with the specified detection channels, you should prepare a minimum of 8 essential controls, with up to 14 being ideal for comprehensive and accurate results.

**Minimum Essential Controls (8 controls):**
*   **1 Unstained Control:** To determine autofluorescence.
*   **5 Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** One for each fluorochrome (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750) to correct for spectral overlap.
*   **1 Viability Dye Control:** To exclude dead cells from the analysis.
*   **1 "Beads Alone" Control:** To assess the fluorescence of the streptavidin beads themselves.

**Highly Recommended Additional Controls (up to 6 more):**
*   **5 Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** One for each channel to accurately set gates, which is especially critical for sorting.
*   **Biological Controls (as needed):** Including positive and negative cell populations to validate staining specificity. Isotype controls are another option but are less commonly used now in favor of FMOs.
