    "After a gene duplication event, the new gene copy is often redundant. The most common fate for this redundant copy is to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as pseudogenization. Therefore, pseudogenization leads to the loss of the duplicate gene's function, not its retention as a working gene.\n\nFor both copies to be retained in the genome, there must be a selective advantage to keeping both. The primary mechanisms that explain this retention and subsequent divergence are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is a process where one of the duplicated genes retains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. The evolution of a new function ensures that both gene copies become essential and are preserved by natural selection.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** occurs when the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex regulation. After duplication, each gene copy accumulates mutations that degrade a part of its original function, but not the same part. As a result, the two genes end up partitioning the ancestral functions between them, a \"division of labor.\" Both copies are now required to fully perform the original set of functions, leading to their preservation.\n\n**Gene conversion** is a mechanism of DNA repair that can happen between highly similar sequences, like young gene duplicates. It tends to homogenize the sequences, which can counteract divergence. While it can also create novel gene variants by shuffling sequences, it is not considered the primary mechanism driving the stable retention and divergence of two distinct functional genes.\n\n**Adaptive radiation** is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species. Gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, but it is not itself a molecular mechanism for the retention of individual genes.\n\nComparing neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, both are crucial for retaining duplicate genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a highly likely, if not more common, mechanism for initial retention. This is because it can occur through the accumulation of relatively common degenerative mutations that disable different subfunctions in each copy (a process called Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation). Neofunctionalization, by contrast, requires a rarer beneficial gain-of-function mutation to occur. Some models even propose that subfunctionalization can act as a transitional state, preserving the duplicate from being lost and allowing more evolutionary time for neofunctionalization to potentially occur later. Given that it provides a plausible neutral pathway for retaining both copies through complementary loss of function, subfunctionalization is a very likely mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A. Gene conversion** primarily homogenizes sequences, working against divergence.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization** is the loss of one copy's function, not retention.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization** is a valid but potentially rarer mechanism requiring a new beneficial function.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization** is a highly plausible mechanism that preserves both copies through partitioning of original functions, driven by more common mutational events.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation** is a macroevolutionary process, not a direct molecular mechanism of gene retention.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is a strong candidate for the most likely mechanism responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes among the choices given.\n\n<<<D>>>"
