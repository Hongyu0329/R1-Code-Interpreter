    "This haiku is a riddle in which the title, \"The Bays,\" is a pun for \"The B's.\" The three lines of the haiku are clues to three words that start with the letter \"B.\"\n\nHere is a line-by-line breakdown of the riddle:\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"** refers to a strong wind, or a **BLOW**.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"** alludes to the 30 pieces of silver that Judas received for betraying Jesus, a pivotal event that brought about significant change. This is a **BRIBE**.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"** describes the Annunciation, where Mary accepted the will of God. In this context, she is often referred to as the **BLESSED** Virgin Mary.\n\nTherefore, the three \"B\" words are BLOW, BRIBE, and BLESSED. In alphabetical order, the answer is:\n\n<<<BLESSED, BLOW, BRIBE>>>"
