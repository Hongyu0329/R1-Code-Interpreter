    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm adapted for matrices or analyze the rank of a stacked matrix composed of P1 and P2.\n\nThe two given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\nA key concept in this context is that of right co-primality. Two polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, are considered right co-prime if their only common right divisors are unimodular matrices. A polynomial matrix is called unimodular if its determinant is a non-zero constant. If two matrices are right co-prime, their GCRD can be any unimodular matrix, and the identity matrix is typically chosen as the canonical representation.\n\nTo test for right co-primality, we can form a stacked matrix M(s) by vertically concatenating P1 and P2 (or P2 and P1) and then check if this stacked matrix has full column rank for all complex values of 's'.\nM(s) = [P1(s) ; P2(s)] = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2; s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\nThe matrix M(s) is a 4x2 matrix. It has full column rank (which is 2) unless all of its 2x2 submatrices have a determinant of zero. The common roots of the determinants of all possible 2x2 submatrices are the values of 's' for which the rank of M(s) might drop below 2.\n\nLet's compute the determinants of the six possible 2x2 submatrices of M(s):\n1.  det(rows 1, 2) = det(P1) = (s^2 + s)(s^2) - (-s)(-s^2 - 1) = s^4 + s^3 - (s^3 + s) = s^4 - s\n2.  det(rows 1, 3) = det([s^2 + s, -s; s, 0]) = -( -s * s) = s^2\n3.  det(rows 1, 4) = det([s^2 + s, -s; -s - 1, 1]) = (s^2 + s) - (-s)(-s - 1) = s^2 + s - (s^2 + s) = 0\n4.  det(rows 2, 3) = det([-s^2 - 1, s^2; s, 0]) = - (s^2 * s) = -s^3\n5.  det(rows 2, 4) = det([-s^2 - 1, s^2; -s - 1, 1]) = (-s^2 - 1) - s^2(-s - 1) = -s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2 = s^3 - 1\n6.  det(rows 3, 4) = det(P2) = s*1 - 0*(-s - 1) = s\n\nFor the rank of M(s) to be less than 2, all these determinants must be simultaneously zero. The roots for each determinant are:\n1.  s(s^3 - 1) = 0  => s=0 or s^3=1\n2.  s^2 = 0  => s=0\n3.  This is always 0.\n4.  -s^3 = 0  => s=0\n5.  s^3 - 1 = 0  => s^3=1\n6.  s = 0  => s=0\n\nThe only value of 's' for which all determinants *could* be zero is s=0. We must check the rank of M(0) explicitly. At s=0, the sub-determinant d5(0) = 0^3 - 1 = -1. Since at least one 2x2 sub-determinant is non-zero at s=0, the rank of M(0) is 2.\n\nBecause there is no value of 's' for which the rank of the stacked matrix M(s) drops below 2, the matrices P1 and P2 are right co-prime.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor of two right co-prime matrices is any unimodular matrix. The simplest and most common choice for a unimodular GCRD is the identity matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
