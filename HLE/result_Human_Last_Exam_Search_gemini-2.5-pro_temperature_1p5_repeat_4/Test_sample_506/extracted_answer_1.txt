**1. Valsartan**
*   **Drug Class:** Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB).
*   **Rationale:** For patients with hypertension and compelling indications such as diabetes (A1C of 6.7%) and chronic kidney disease, an ARB or ACE inhibitor is a cornerstone of therapy for its kidney-protective benefits. As an African American, MM is at a higher risk for angioedema with ACE inhibitors, making an ARB a potentially safer choice. This class of medication is a primary component of a standard three-drug regimen for resistant hypertension.

**2. Amlodipine**
*   **Drug Class:** Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB).
*   **Rationale:** CCBs are a recommended first-line treatment for hypertension in African American patients and work well in combination with an ARB. Given that many diuretics and the non-dihydropyridine CCB verapamil are not options for MM, amlodipine is a logical and effective choice to be part of the core treatment regimen. A long-acting CCB is a standard part of the definition for a resistant hypertension regimen.

**3. Spironolactone**
*   **Drug Class:** Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist (MRA) / Potassium-Sparing Diuretic.
*   **Rationale:** MM's condition is defined as resistant hypertension, as her blood pressure (BP) is not controlled despite being on three antihypertensive medications. For resistant hypertension, spironolactone is the guideline-recommended fourth-line agent and has been shown to be superior to other add-on therapies like beta-blockers or alpha-blockers. Since MM cannot take eplerenone or common thiazide and loop diuretics, spironolactone is the most evidence-based choice to target the likely mechanism of sodium retention involved in her resistant hypertension. Her kidney function (SCr = 0.9) appears adequate to initiate this therapy, with appropriate monitoring for hyperkalemia.
