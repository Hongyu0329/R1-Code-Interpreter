    "Without the Norse invasions and the subsequent interaction with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster**.\n\nHere is the linguistic breakdown:\n\n*   **Old English:** The original Anglo-Saxon word for a female sibling was *sweostor* or *swuster*. These words are native to Old English, descending from the Proto-Germanic *swestr-*.\n*   **Old Norse Influence:** The Vikings introduced their own word, *systir*. Over time, the Old Norse form with its \"i\" sound influenced and eventually replaced the native English vowel sound. The current word \"sister\" is therefore a hybrid, combining an English root with Norse phonetics.\n*   **Hypothetical Evolution:** Had the Norse influence never occurred, the Old English *sweostor* would have naturally evolved into the form *suster* in Middle English, which it did in areas with less Scandinavian contact. This word follows a similar developmental path to its cognates in other Germanic languages that did not have the same Norse influence, such as the German *Schwester* and the Dutch *zuster*.\n\nIf the word *suster* had continued its development into Modern English, it would likely have retained its spelling and been pronounced with a short \"u\" sound, similar to the words \"custom\" or \"duster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
