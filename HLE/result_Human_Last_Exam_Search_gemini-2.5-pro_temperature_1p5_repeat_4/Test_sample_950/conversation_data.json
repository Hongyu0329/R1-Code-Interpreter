    "The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring of this space is denoted by $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe Grassmannian $G(k, n)$ is diffeomorphic to $G(n-k, n)$, so $G(3, 5)$ is diffeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each integral cohomology group $H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. It is a known result in algebraic topology that the torsion in the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians consists entirely of elements of order 2.\n\nThe additive structure of the integral cohomology groups of $G(2, 5)$ has been computed. The groups are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^2(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^6(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of these groups. Let $T_i$ be the torsion subgroup of $H^i(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   $T_0 = \\{0\\}$\n*   $T_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $T_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $T_3 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $T_4 = \\{0\\}$\n*   $T_5 = \\{0\\}$\n*   $T_6 = \\{0\\}$\n\nThus, the torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring is $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$.\n\nThe question asks for the **rank** of this torsion subgroup. In the context of finitely generated abelian groups, the rank of a group is the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its decomposition into a direct sum of cyclic groups. An abelian group can be written as $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T_{torsion}$, where $r$ is the rank and $T_{torsion}$ is the torsion subgroup.\n\nThe torsion subgroup we have found is $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$. This is a finite group, and by definition, a torsion group. Since there are no copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its decomposition, its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
