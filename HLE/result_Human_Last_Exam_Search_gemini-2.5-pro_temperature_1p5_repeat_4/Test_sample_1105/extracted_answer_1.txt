The maximum distance $l_{\text{max}}$ is given by the formula:
$l_{\text{max}} = \frac{(F l_0 + \frac{GmM}{l_0} - \frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2) + \sqrt{(F l_0 + \frac{GmM}{l_0} - \frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2)^2 - 4FGmM}}{2F}$
where:
*   $m$ is the mass of the asteroid A.
*   $M$ is the mass of the spaceship B.
*   $l_0$ is the initial distance.
*   $v_0$ is the initial speed.
*   $F$ is the additional applied force.
*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.
