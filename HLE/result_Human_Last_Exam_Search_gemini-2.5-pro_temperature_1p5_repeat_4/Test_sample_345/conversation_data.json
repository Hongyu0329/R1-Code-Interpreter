    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museums of Berlin) in 1967. The acquisition was a purchase from the artist's widow, Maria Günther. The painting is housed in the Nationalgalerie, which is part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (The Radio Amateur or Petit Bourgeois at the Radio), was created by Günther in the same year he had his artistic breakthrough. The artwork depicts a man, identified as a certain Herr Schreck who was a paraplegic and lived in Günther's house, listening to the radio. The radio was a relatively new and influential medium at the time, and it became a recurring motif in the art of the New Objectivity movement. The painting is considered a satirical look at a middle-class sitting room.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
