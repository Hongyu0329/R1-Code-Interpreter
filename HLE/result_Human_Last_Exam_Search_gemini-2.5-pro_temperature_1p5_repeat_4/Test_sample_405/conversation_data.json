    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, red, black, violet, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent waxy solid that can appear colorless or white when pure. It often takes on a yellowish hue due to impurities or upon exposure to light and heat, which causes a gradual transformation into red phosphorus. This yellowish form is commonly referred to as yellow phosphorus, but it is not considered a distinct allotrope.\n\nRed phosphorus is known for its characteristic deep red color. However, its appearance can vary, with some forms described as red-brown or having a violet tinge.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable form and has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a distinct crystalline form that appears as violet or purple crystals. It can also appear as brown-violet.\n\nA more recently synthesized form is blue phosphorus, which is a two-dimensional material. As its name suggests, this allotrope is blue in color.\n\nIn summary, the observable colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\n*   **White** (can appear colorless or yellow with impurities)\n*   **Red** (can appear as red-brown)\n*   **Black**\n*   **Violet**\n*   **Blue**\n\n<<<5>>>"
