    "The number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is 268.\n\nIn the context of the Gauss class number problem, which seeks to classify imaginary quadratic fields by their class number, the problem has been solved for class numbers up to 100. The work of M. Watkins, in his paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" provides a complete list of the number of negative fundamental discriminants for each class number up to 100.\n\nA fundamental discriminant is a key concept in this problem, representing the unique discriminant of a quadratic number field. For any given class number *n*, there are a finite number of imaginary quadratic fields with that class number.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) contains the sequence A046125, which lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number *n*. For *n* = 48, this sequence provides the value 268. This result is sourced from the aforementioned work of Watkins.\n\n<<<268>>>"
