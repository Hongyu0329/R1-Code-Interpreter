Let `j` be the largest integer such that the total distance `m` is greater than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the first `j` optimal segments. The length of these segments is calculated as `100 / (2n - 2i + 1)` for the `i`-th segment. The summation of these lengths up to `j` is given by:
`100 * \sum_{i=1}^{j} (1 / (2n - 2i + 1)) <= m`

The maximum amount of water remaining at the destination, `W_left`, is then:
`W_left = (n - j) * 100 - (2n - 2j - 1) * (m - 100 * \sum_{i=1}^{j} (1 / (2n - 2i + 1)))`

Where:
*   `n` is the initial amount of water in multiples of 100 liters.
*   `m` is the total distance to the destination in kilometers.
*   The summation term `\sum_{i=1}^{j}` is considered to be 0 if `j=0`.
