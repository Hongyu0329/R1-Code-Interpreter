The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone (ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate) cannot be determined without direct access to a Böttcher score calculator. The product of the reaction is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, and its Böttcher Molecular Complexity must be calculated using a specialized tool such as the one provided by the Forli Lab.
