The exact amount of money $c_k$ that person $p_k$ receives is given by the formula:
$c_{k} = \frac{k n^{2}(n+1)^{2}}{24} (3n^{2}+7n+2-6k)$
This can also be written as:
$c_{k} = \frac{k n^{2}(n+1)^{2}((n+2)(3n+1)-6k)}{24}$
or explicitly in terms of the sums of powers:
$c_k = k \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^3 + k \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right) \left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\right) - k^2 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$
