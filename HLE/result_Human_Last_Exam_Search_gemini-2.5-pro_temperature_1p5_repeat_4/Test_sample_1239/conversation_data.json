    "### The Lie Group of Symmetries of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ has a Dimension of 12\n\nThe determination of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions reveals a nuanced picture. While a classical eleven-parameter group is often cited, a more complete analysis shows the maximal Lie invariance algebra is, in fact, infinite-dimensional. However, a well-established finite-dimensional subalgebra is commonly referred to as the symmetry group.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are given by:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.\n\nThe recognized Lie group of symmetries for these equations is an extension of the Galilean group. It is an 11-parameter group whose transformations leave the equations invariant. These transformations can be broken down into the following one-parameter subgroups:\n\n*   **Time translations:** One parameter, which reflects the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.\n*   **Space translations:** Three parameters, corresponding to the three spatial directions, indicating that the laws of physics are the same everywhere in space.\n*   **Rotations:** Three parameters, for rotations about the three spatial axes, which shows that the laws of physics are isotropic.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Three parameters, which relate the equations in a stationary frame to one moving at a constant velocity.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** One parameter, which reflects a form of self-similarity in the equations.\n\nThe sum of these parameters (1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1) gives a total of 11. Consequently, the Lie algebra of this symmetry group has a dimension of 11.\n\nIt is important to note that some sources indicate the maximal Lie invariance algebra of the Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. This arises from allowing more general transformations, particularly involving arbitrary functions of time. However, the 11-dimensional extended Galilean group is the standard, physically significant finite-dimensional symmetry group. For compressible flows, the dimension of the Lie symmetry group has been computed to be 12.\n\n<<<11>>>"
