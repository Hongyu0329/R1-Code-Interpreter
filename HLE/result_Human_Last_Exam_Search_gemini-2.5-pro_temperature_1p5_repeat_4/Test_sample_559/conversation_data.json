    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix in a phase plane is a curve that divides the plane into regions of different long-term behavior, and it is often associated with the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe restrict our attention to the upper half-plane where $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points $(d, u)$ are found by setting $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the first equation:\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the first equation:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nWe analyze the stability of these points by linearizing the system and finding the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are both 0, so this is a degenerate equilibrium point and linearization is inconclusive.\n*   **At (0, 1):** $J(0,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, (0, 1) is an unstable node (a source).\n*   **At (-1, 1):** $J(-1,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, (-1, 1) is a saddle point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is an invariant manifold passing through a saddle point. We look for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$ that passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$. An invariant curve must satisfy the condition that a trajectory starting on the curve stays on the curve.\n\nLet's test for a simple algebraic curve. After testing for linear and then quadratic functions, it can be demonstrated that the parabola $d = -u^2$ is an invariant curve of the system. We can verify this by substituting $d=-u^2$ into the system of differential equations.\n\nThe time derivative of $d=-u^2$ is:\n$d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot u'(t) = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow, we substitute $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first differential equation:\nRHS $= 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$= 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant curve.\n\nThis curve passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$, since $-1 = -(1)^2$. It also passes through the degenerate equilibrium point $(0, 0)$. A trajectory that connects two equilibrium points, with at least one being a saddle point, is a separatrix.\n\nThis separatrix, the parabola $d=-u^2$, divides the phase plane for $u>0$. In the region $0 < u < 1$, trajectories on this curve travel from the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$. This curve separates trajectories with different behaviors as they approach the invariant line $u=0$.\n\nThe separatrix of the system is the curve given by the equation:\n$$d = -u^2$$\n\n<<<The separatrix is the parabola $d=-u^2$.>>>"
