    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), two isomers are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands in the *cis*-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2] complex with the bidentate ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole. This results in the formation of a tris-chelate octahedral complex with the formula [Ru(bpy)2(2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)]^2+.\n\nAn octahedral complex with three bidentate ligands is chiral, meaning it can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images. These two isomers are known as enantiomers and are designated as delta (Δ) and lambda (Λ). This is analogous to the well-known complex [Ru(bpy)3]^2+, which is also chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n\nThe starting material, *cis*-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2], is also chiral. The product, which contains two bipyridine ligands and one 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole ligand, is classified as a heteroleptic tris(bidentate) complex. Such complexes, of the general formula [M(AA)2(BB)]^n+, have one possible geometric arrangement but exist as a pair of enantiomers. In a related study, a dinuclear ruthenium complex using this same thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole ligand was found to form diastereoisomers (meso and rac), which arise from the different combinations of chiral centers (Δ/Λ and Δ/Δ-Λ/Λ). For the mononuclear complex in question, the product will be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, Δ and Λ.\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields two stereoisomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
