    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip and the corresponding spinal articulation. While multiple elements such as arm and head placement also differ, they are often a result of the fundamental difference in hip alignment.\n\nIn the **Vaganova method**, a cambré derrière is executed with a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and lifted torso. The backbend is initiated from the upper back, with the hips remaining relatively aligned and stable. Agrippina Vaganova's technique prioritizes a sense of length and stability in the lower back and hips to create a controlled and elegant line. The arms in Vaganova are known for their expressiveness and fluidity, and in a cambré back, the head often follows the line of the arm, with the focus remaining downstage to keep the face visible to the audience. The elbows are characteristically held open.\n\nConversely, the **Balanchine method** is known for its speed, athleticism, and a more \"open\" aesthetic. A signature of the Balanchine style is a deep plié and a notable arabesque with an open hip that faces the audience. This principle of an open hip is also applied to the cambré derrière, allowing for a greater range of motion and a more dynamic, and sometimes more extreme, backbend. George Balanchine was known to have his dancers execute deep cambrés. This hip placement results in a distinct spiral of the torso, a defining feature of the \"Balanchine head,\" where the face is presented more directly to the audience.\n\nTherefore, the placement of the hip—square in Vaganova versus open in Balanchine—is a fundamental differentiator that influences the overall execution of the cambré derrière in these two renowned ballet techniques.\n\n<<<B>>>"
