    "Based on a detailed analysis of the relevant mathematical and physical concepts, the Crawley-Nordström invariant is not defined for the object as described in the query. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Nature of the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**: The Crawley-Nordström invariant, also known as the $\\nu$-invariant, is a topological invariant specifically associated with a G₂-structure on a 7-dimensional manifold. It is a value in $\\mathbb{Z}/48$ that helps to classify different G₂-structures.\n\n2.  **Nature of the Calabi-Yau Link**: The object described by the polynomial $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$ in the space defined by the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) is a Calabi-Yau threefold singularity. The \"link\" of this singularity is a 7-dimensional manifold that results from intersecting the hypersurface with a small sphere in the ambient complex 5-space.\n\n3.  **Fundamental Mismatch**: The core issue is that the Calabi-Yau link is not inherently equipped with a G₂-structure. The geometry naturally associated with the link is of a different type (typically Sasaki-Einstein), and its metric cone has a holonomy group of SU(4), not G₂. While there are advanced physical and mathematical constructions that relate Calabi-Yau manifolds to G₂-manifolds, the Crawley-Nordström invariant belongs to the resulting G₂-manifold, not to the initial Calabi-Yau link itself. The query provides no information about a G₂-structure to be placed on the link.\n\nAdditionally, the provided polynomial is not weighted-homogeneous with the given weights due to a likely typo in the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$. Its degree is 224, whereas the Calabi-Yau condition requires all terms to have a degree of 225, which is the sum of the weights.\n\nTherefore, since the Crawley-Nordström invariant is an attribute of a geometric structure that the specified Calabi-Yau link does not possess, the question is ill-posed.\n\n<<<The Crawley-Nordström invariant is not a defined property for the specified Calabi-Yau link.>>>"
