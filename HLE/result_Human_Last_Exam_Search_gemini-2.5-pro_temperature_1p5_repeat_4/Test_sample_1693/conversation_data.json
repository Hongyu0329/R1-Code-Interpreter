    "The largest French warship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the submarine **Doris (Q135)**.\n\nThe *Doris*, a *Circé*-class coastal submarine, was sunk by the German U-boat U-9 on May 8 or 9, 1940, off the Dutch coast. The submarine had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons and a submerged displacement of 776 tons.\n\nAnother French warship, the destroyer *Siroco*, was sunk on May 31, 1940, during the Dunkirk evacuation. However, it was sunk by German S-boats (motor torpedo boats), not a U-boat. Other larger French vessels lost during this period were not sunk by U-boats. For instance, the battleship *Bretagne* was sunk by the British Royal Navy at Mers-el-Kébir.\n\n<<<Doris (Q135)>>>"
