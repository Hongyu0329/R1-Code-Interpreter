    "The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights during randomized uniform gossiping is 1/25.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Defining the Barbell Graph Structure:** A barbell graph is typically constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a path. The phrase \"the bottleneck edge\" implies there is a single, unique edge acting as the bridge. For a 10-node graph, the most standard and logical structure is two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5), connected by a single edge. This one edge is the bottleneck that connects the two halves of the graph.\n\n2.  **Characterizing the Nodes and Edges:**\n    *   **Nodes (N):** The graph has a total of 10 nodes. Let's designate the two K5 cliques as C1 and C2.\n    *   **Edges (E):** Each K5 clique has (5 * 4) / 2 = 10 edges. With two such cliques, we have 20 edges. Adding the single bottleneck edge that connects them brings the total number of edges to 21.\n    *   **Node Degrees:**\n        *   Within each K5 clique, a node is connected to 4 other nodes.\n        *   There are two special nodes, one in each clique, that are connected by the bottleneck edge. Let's call them `u` (in C1) and `v` (in C2).\n        *   The degree of `u` is 4 (from its connections within C1) + 1 (from the connection to `v`), making its total degree `d(u) = 5`.\n        *   Similarly, the degree of `v` is `d(v) = 5`.\n        *   The other 8 nodes (4 in each clique) are only connected within their respective cliques, so their degree is 4.\n\n3.  **Understanding Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** In this process, a node is selected uniformly at random from the entire graph. This chosen node then selects one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to interact with. The edge between the chosen node and its selected neighbor is the \"sampled\" edge for that step.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Probability:**\n    *   The probability of selecting any specific node in the 10-node graph is 1/10.\n    *   The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n        1.  Node `u` is selected, and it then chooses to contact node `v`.\n        2.  Node `v` is selected, and it then chooses to contact node `u`.\n    *   **Case 1:** The probability of selecting node `u` is 1/10. Given that `u` is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor `v` is 1 divided by its degree, which is `1/d(u) = 1/5`. So, the probability for this case is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n    *   **Case 2:** The probability of selecting node `v` is 1/10. Given that `v` is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor `u` is `1/d(v) = 1/5`. The probability for this case is also (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases: 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nThis result can be generalized by the formula for the probability of sampling any edge `e = (u,v)`: `P(e) = (1/N) * (1/d(u) + 1/d(v))`, where `N` is the total number of nodes and `d` is the degree of a node.\n\nApplying this formula to the bottleneck edge:\n`P(bottleneck) = (1/10) * (1/5 + 1/5) = (1/10) * (2/5) = 2/50 = 1/25.`\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
