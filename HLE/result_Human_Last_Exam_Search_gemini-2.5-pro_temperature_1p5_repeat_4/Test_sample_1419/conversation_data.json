    "In the ϕ<sup>4</sup> theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is directly proportional to ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the spacetime dimension.\n\nThe determination of this fixed point arises from the renormalization group analysis of the theory. The behavior of the coupling constant under changes in the energy scale is described by the beta function, β(u). To find the fixed point, one seeks the values of the coupling u* for which the beta function is zero, indicating that the coupling no longer changes with the scale.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the ϕ<sup>4</sup> theory with a single scalar field (O(1) model) in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions is given by:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (9 / (8π<sup>2</sup>))u<sup>2</sup>\n\nSetting β(u*) = 0 yields two possible fixed points:\n1.  u* = 0, which is the trivial Gaussian fixed point.\n2.  u* = (8π<sup>2</sup> / 9)ϵ, which is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nThis non-trivial fixed point governs the universal critical behavior of systems in the same universality class as the ϕ<sup>4</sup> theory, such as the Ising model near its critical point. The existence of this fixed point for small positive ϵ allows for a systematic study of critical phenomena using the epsilon expansion.\n\n<<<u* = (8π² / 9)ε>>>"
