    "The problem of determining the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a cube of edge length 15 is a classic packing problem. A straightforward approach might be to divide the volume of the cube by the volume of a single block. However, this method overlooks the geometric constraints of fitting the blocks without cutting them.\n\nA simple packing strategy involves filling the cube in sections:\n*   First, a 9x15x15 section can be filled by aligning the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 9-unit dimension of this section. This accommodates `1 * 15 * 15 = 225` blocks.\n*   The remaining space is a 6x15x15 block. Within this, a 6x9x15 section can be filled, holding `6 * 1 * 15 = 90` blocks.\n*   This leaves a 6x6x15 space. A 6x6x9 section can be filled with `6 * 6 * 1 = 36` blocks.\n*   The final remaining space is a 6x6x6 cube, into which no 9x1x1 block can fit.\n\nThis greedy algorithm yields a total of `225 + 90 + 36 = 351` blocks. However, this is not the optimal solution.\n\nA more advanced method involves a coloring argument. Each unit cube `(x, y, z)` within the 15x15x15 cube (where x, y, z range from 0 to 14) is assigned a color based on the value of `(x + y + z) mod 9`. Any 9x1x1 block, regardless of its placement and orientation, will always occupy exactly one unit cube of each of the nine colors. Therefore, the maximum number of blocks that can be packed is limited by the color that appears the least number of times.\n\nCalculating the number of unit cubes for each color reveals that the minimum count for any single color is 372. This establishes an upper bound on the number of blocks that can be packed. It has been shown that a packing arrangement for this number of blocks is possible. This problem appeared in the 2005 American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), and the accepted answer is 372.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that will fit inside a cube of edge length 15 is 372.\n\n<<<372>>>"
