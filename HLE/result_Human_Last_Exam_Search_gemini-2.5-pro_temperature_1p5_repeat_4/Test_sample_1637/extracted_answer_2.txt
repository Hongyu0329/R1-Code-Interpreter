Yes, replacing the amide group with a PEG (Polyethylene glycol) group is a very promising and scientifically sound strategy to solve the precipitation problem. The core issue is the low aqueous solubility of your probe, and PEGylation is a widely used and effective method to increase the water solubility of hydrophobic small molecules for biological applications. The addition of a hydrophilic PEG chain will increase the overall polarity of your compound, making it less likely to precipitate out of the cell culture medium at the desired concentration of 100 ÂµM.
