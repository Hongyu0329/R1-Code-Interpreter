    "According to Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph $G$ with maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the cases where $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, which is not a complete graph. Let the maximum degree of $G$ be $\\Delta(G)$.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible value for the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$. A general upper bound for the chromatic number of any graph is $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1$. We need to determine if this bound can be achieved under the given conditions.\n\nLet's consider the connected components of $G$. The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n\nLet $H$ be a connected component of $G$. According to Brooks' Theorem, $\\chi(H) \\le \\Delta(H)$, unless $H$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\nIf a component $H$ is a complete graph $K_k$, its chromatic number is $k$ and its maximum degree is $k-1$. Thus, $\\chi(H) = \\Delta(H) + 1$.\nIf a component $H$ is an odd cycle, its chromatic number is 3 and its maximum degree is 2. Thus, $\\chi(H) = 3 = \\Delta(H) + 1$.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ constructed as follows: one component is the complete graph $K_{\\Delta(G)+1}$, and the other $12345 - (\\Delta(G)+1)$ components are isolated vertices. For this construction to be valid, the number of vertices in the complete graph component cannot exceed the total number of vertices, i.e., $\\Delta(G)+1 \\le 12345$. The maximum degree of any graph with 12345 vertices is at most 12344, so this condition is always met.\n\nLet's check the properties of this constructed graph $G$:\n1.  It has $12345$ vertices.\n2.  Its maximum degree is the maximum degree of the $K_{\\Delta(G)+1}$ component, which is $\\Delta(G)$.\n3.  Its chromatic number is the chromatic number of the $K_{\\Delta(G)+1}$ component, which is $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n4.  The graph $G$ is not a complete graph, because it has isolated vertices (unless $\\Delta(G)+1 = 12345$, which would mean $\\Delta(G) = 12344$).\n\nIf $\\Delta(G) = 12344$, the constructed graph would be the complete graph $K_{12345}$, which is explicitly excluded. For any graph $G$ with $\\Delta(G) = 12344$ that is not $K_{12345}$, it must be missing at least one edge. Such a graph can be shown to have a chromatic number of at most $12344$, which is $\\Delta(G)$.\n\nHowever, for any maximum degree $\\Delta(G) < 12344$, the construction provides a valid graph that is not complete and requires $\\Delta(G)+1$ colors. Since the question asks for the maximum number of colors needed, we should consider the case that requires the most colors. For a given maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, this value can be as high as $\\Delta(G)+1$.\n\nThus, the maximum number of colors needed is $\\Delta(G)$.\n\n<<<$\\Delta(G)$>>>"
