    "In a surface code, the introduction of holes or defects in the lattice of physical qubits allows for the encoding of logical qubits. The precise number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of the surface, including the number of holes and the boundary conditions of the patch.\n\nFor a planar surface code patch, creating a hole introduces a degree of freedom that can be used to define a logical qubit. According to a common method, a planar lattice with *b* closed holes can encode *k* = *b* logical qubits. Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode at most two logical qubits.\n\nWhen considering two separate patches of surface code, the logical qubits on each patch are distinct. To perform operations between these logical qubits, techniques such as lattice surgery would be required to merge and split the patches. However, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits encoded on each individual patch.\n\nTherefore, with two patches of surface code, each containing two holes, the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded is the sum of the qubits from each patch. This results in a total of 2 + 2 = 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
