    "**Controversy Surrounds Public Emergence of \"Azikiwe\" in Goodluck Jonathan's Name**\n\nThere is no definitive, officially documented year when former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan first publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe.\" However, the name \"Azikiwe\" became a subject of public discourse and controversy around 2010, in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\nReports from that time suggest that the inclusion and emphasis of \"Azikiwe\" in his name was part of a political strategy to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group. Then-Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, notably referred to the President as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a university convocation lecture in August 2010. This event stirred surprise and murmuring among the audience, prompting Akunyili to explain that it was a name given to him by his grandparents.\n\nDespite this explanation, the timing of the name's prominence led to speculation that it was a ploy to create a closer affinity with the Igbo people, as the name is strongly associated with Nigeria's first President, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was of Igbo origin.\n\nAn opinion piece from November 2010 highlighted the perceived inconsistency in Jonathan's own use of the name. The author claimed that during his presidential declaration in September 2010, Jonathan referred to himself in three different ways, sometimes including \"Azikiwe,\" sometimes omitting it, and at one point altering the order of his middle names.\n\nWhile some biographical sources list \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" as his full name, it is also reported that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother. Nevertheless, its public emergence as part of his official nomenclature is strongly tied to the political campaigns of 2010.\n\n<<<There is no specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself as Azikiwe, as the name was reportedly part of his full name from a young age. However, the name came to public prominence and became a topic of discussion and some controversy around 2010.>>>"
