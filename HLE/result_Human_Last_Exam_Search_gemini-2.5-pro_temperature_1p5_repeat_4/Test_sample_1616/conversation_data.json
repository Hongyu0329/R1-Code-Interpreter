    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a tense vowel (a long vowel or diphthong) becomes a lax vowel (a short vowel) when it is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed. This rule typically applies to words derived from Latin and Greek, often when a suffix is added.\n\nLet's analyze each word:\n\n*   **derivative**: This four-syllable word is derived from the two-syllable word *derive*. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: Derived from the word *serene*, the tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in the four-syllable word *serenity*. This follows the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **gratitude**: In this three-syllable word, the tense vowel /eɪ/ from the related word *grateful* becomes the lax vowel /æ/. This is another standard example of the rule.\n*   **southern**, **pleasant**, and **shadow**: These words are all disyllabic (have two syllables). Therefore, by definition, they cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* (three-syllable) laxing. The vowel changes seen in these words (south /aʊ/ → southern /ʌ/; please /iː/ → pleasant /ɛ/; shade /eɪ/ → shadow /æ/) are examples of a different, though related, process known as disyllabic laxing.\n\nBased on this analysis, *derivative*, *serenity*, and *gratitude* have all undergone trisyllabic laxing. The words *southern*, *pleasant*, and *shadow* have not, as they are only two syllables long. Since the question asks for a single word, any of these three would be a correct answer, but *shadow* (from *shade*) is a frequently cited example of a different laxing process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
