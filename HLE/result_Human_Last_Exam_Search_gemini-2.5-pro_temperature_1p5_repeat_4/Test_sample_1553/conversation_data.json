    "The main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" Adam Zamoyski, has a close and significant relationship with the character Angelika McPherson. Reviewers have described their bond as a \"spiritual kinship,\" and have even referred to them as a \"collective main character.\" Angelika provides assistance to Adam, who is grappling with amnesia in the complex world of the 29th century.\n\nWhile their connection is a central element of the plot, and has been noted as having romantic undertones, sources do not explicitly state that they get married. One analysis points out that the author intentionally avoided a clichéd romance storyline between Zamoyski and McPherson. Another review characterizes Angelika as a \"damsel in distress\" or a potential \"prize\" for the hero, a common trope that doesn't necessarily culminate in marriage.\n\nDespite thorough searches of plot summaries, character analyses, and discussions about the novel's ending, there is no direct confirmation of a marriage between Adam Zamoyski and Angelika McPherson. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively state that the main character marries Angelika.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a definitive answer as to whether the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" gets married, or the name of the person they might marry. The available information does not contain this specific detail.>>>"
