    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. This reaction involves a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with a carbonyl compound. The outcome is the formation of a new carbon-carbon double bond, replacing the original carbon-oxygen double bond of the starting material, along with triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe reaction in question involves two key components:\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the chemical structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane. This ylide has the structure (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₅).\n\nIn this specific reaction, the oxygen atom of pivalaldehyde's carbonyl group is replaced by the carbanion portion of the ylide, which is =CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₅). This exchange results in the formation of a new alkene.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the resulting product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The chemical structure is:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\nRegarding the stereochemistry of the newly formed double bond, Wittig reactions can produce either Z (cis) or E (trans) isomers. The outcome is influenced by the stability of the ylide.\n*   **Stabilized ylides**, which contain electron-withdrawing groups, typically favor the formation of the E-isomer.\n*   **Unstabilized ylides**, with alkyl groups, generally yield the Z-isomer.\n\nThe ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, has an alkyl-type substituent on the carbanion (-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)), which classifies it as a non-stabilized ylide. Reactions with non-stabilized ylides typically favor the Z-isomer under kinetic control. However, the presence of sterically bulky groups on both the aldehyde (the tert-butyl group) and the ylide can significantly influence the stereochemical outcome, often favoring the more thermodynamically stable E-isomer to minimize steric hindrance.\n\nGiven the steric bulk of both reactants, the major product is expected to be the E-isomer.\n\nThus, the primary product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is **(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
