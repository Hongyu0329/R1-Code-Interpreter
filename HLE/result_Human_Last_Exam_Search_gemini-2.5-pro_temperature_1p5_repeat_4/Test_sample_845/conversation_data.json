    "The value between heartbeats used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **interbeat interval (IBI)**.\n\nThis interval represents the time duration between two consecutive heartbeats. While IBI is a general term, other more specific terms are also used depending on the measurement method:\n\n*   **RR interval:** When HRV is measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG), the value is called the RR interval. This refers to the time between two successive R-peaks of the QRS complex on the ECG waveform.\n*   **Peak-to-Peak interval:** When using photoplethysmography (PPG), as mentioned in your question, the interval can be referred to as the peak-to-peak interval.\n\nAlthough different terms exist, \"interbeat interval\" (IBI) is the most common and widely understood term for the time between heartbeats used in HRV analysis. Other, less frequent, terms include \"cycle length variability\" and \"heart period variability\".\n\n<<<interbeat interval (IBI)>>>"
