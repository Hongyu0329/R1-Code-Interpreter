    "The provided SMILES string, C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, describes a complex, star-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). While a direct match for this exact SMILES string in public chemical databases is not readily found, the pattern corresponds to a derivative of triangulene, specifically a tris(ethynyl)triangulene isomer.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group, we first need to establish the molecule's three-dimensional shape. Based on related, highly symmetric \"star-shaped\" molecules with a central fused ring core, this molecule is expected to be planar. The core is a triangular arrangement of fused benzene rings, and the three ethynyl (–C≡CH) groups are attached to the \"corners\" of this triangle, maintaining a high degree of symmetry.\n\nAssuming the molecule is planar and the ethynyl groups are positioned symmetrically, we can identify its symmetry elements:\n\n*   **A principal C₃ rotation axis:** This axis is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and passes through its center. A rotation of 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n*   **Three C₂ rotation axes:** These axes lie in the plane of the molecule. Each axis passes through one of the ethynyl groups and the midpoint of the opposite side of the triangular core.\n*   **A horizontal mirror plane (σₙ):** The plane containing the entire molecule acts as a mirror plane.\n*   **Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ):** Each of these planes contains the principal C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n*   **An S₃ improper rotation axis:** Coincident with the C₃ axis.\n\nA molecule that possesses a C₃ principal axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σₙ) belongs to the **D₃ₙ point group**.\n\n<<<D₃ₙ>>>"
