    "The first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was **An American in Paris**, released in 1951.\n\nThe film, which is set in Paris, features a lengthy ballet sequence that includes scenes set in the Place de la Concorde, the location of the Parisian Luxor Obelisk. While much of the movie was filmed on Hollywood soundstages with recreations of famous Parisian landmarks, there is evidence of the obelisk's inclusion. Notably, a prop oil painting of the Luxor Obelisk was created for and used in the film. Furthermore, various scenes were designed to evoke the atmosphere of the Place de la Concorde, featuring a replica of its iconic fountain.\n\nOther Best Picture winners set in Paris, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) and *Casablanca* (1942), which features flashback scenes in the city, do not have clear evidence of depicting the Luxor Obelisk. The Paris flashbacks in *Casablanca*, for instance, showcase landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower, but not the Place de la Concorde. While *The Life of Emile Zola* is set in Paris, there's no readily available information confirming the obelisk's appearance in the film. Therefore, based on available information, *An American in Paris* is the first film to hold this distinction.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
