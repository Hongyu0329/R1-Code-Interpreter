    "The musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself on Isaac Newton's color circle is G.\n\nWhen yellow and blue are mixed, the resulting color is green. In his work \"Opticks\" from 1704, Sir Isaac Newton proposed a circular arrangement of colors analogous to a musical scale. He divided the spectrum of light into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n\nNewton associated these seven colors with the seven notes of a musical scale, specifically the Dorian mode, which is equivalent to playing the white keys on a piano starting from D. The correspondence is as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe question asks for the musical note corresponding to the range between green (the mixture of yellow and blue) and blue. According to Newton's model, the color green is assigned the musical note G, and the color blue is assigned the note A. The range or segment on the color circle that represents green is therefore associated with the note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
