    "The problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35.\n\nLet the complete graph be \\( K_{35} \\) on a set of 35 vertices. A family of bipartite graphs is said to cover the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) if the union of the edge sets of these bipartite graphs contains every edge of \\( K_{35} \\).\n\nLet the family of bipartite graphs be \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k\\} \\). The vertices of this family can be considered as the union of the vertex sets of each graph in the family, let's denote this by \\( V_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} V(B_i) \\).\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the minimum possible size of \\( V_{\\mathcal{F}} \\).\n\nEvery vertex in the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\) is an endpoint of 34 edges. For any vertex \\(v\\) from \\( K_{35} \\), let's consider an edge \\(e\\) connected to it. For the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to cover all edges of \\( K_{35} \\), the edge \\(e\\) must be an edge in at least one of the bipartite graphs \\( B_i \\in \\mathcal{F} \\). This means that both endpoints of \\(e\\), including \\(v\\), must be vertices in that bipartite graph \\( B_i \\).\n\nConsequently, every vertex of \\( K_{35} \\) must be included in the vertex set of at least one graph in the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\). Therefore, the union of the vertex sets of the graphs in \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) must contain all the vertices of \\( K_{35} \\). This establishes a lower bound for the number of vertices in the family:\n\\( |V_{\\mathcal{F}}| \\ge |V(K_{35})| = 35 \\).\n\nTo find the minimum number of vertices, we need to check if this lower bound of 35 can be achieved. This is possible if there exists a family of bipartite graphs, defined on the 35 vertices of \\( K_{35} \\), that covers all its edges.\n\nSuch constructions are well-known in graph theory:\n*   According to the Graham-Pollak theorem, the complete graph \\( K_n \\) can be decomposed into \\( n-1 \\) complete bipartite subgraphs. For \\( K_{35} \\), this means it can be partitioned into 34 complete bipartite graphs, which together cover all the edges. This partition uses the original 35 vertices.\n*   Another theorem states that the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of \\( K_n \\) is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). For \\( n = 35 \\), this is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 \\). The standard construction for this cover also uses the original 35 vertices.\n\nSince there are established methods to construct a family of bipartite graphs that cover all edges of \\( K_{35} \\) using only its 35 vertices, the minimum number of vertices required is indeed 35.\n\n<<<35>>>"
