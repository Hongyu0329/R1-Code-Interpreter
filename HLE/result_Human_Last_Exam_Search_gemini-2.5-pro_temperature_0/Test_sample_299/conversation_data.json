    "The search results confirm the main points of my reasoning.\n\n*   **Injectivity and Monotonicity**: Any continuous solution to $f(f(x)) = g(x)$ where $g$ is injective must itself be injective, and therefore strictly monotonic.\n*   **No Decreasing Solutions**: Several sources confirm that if $f$ is a real-valued continuous function, there is no solution for $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ if $f$ is decreasing. The argument is that $f(f(x))$ must be an increasing function, which is true for both increasing and decreasing $f$. However, my argument about the limit at infinity holds and proves that no decreasing solution exists. For $f(f(x)) = \\exp(-x)$, a similar argument shows no solution exists because $\\exp(-x)$ is decreasing, while $f(f(x))$ must be increasing.\n*   **Increasing Solutions**: The search results confirm that increasing solutions exist. My derivation that any increasing solution must have a unique zero $a<0$ is also supported.\n*   **Construction and Cardinality**: The method of constructing solutions by defining the function on an interval and then extending it is a valid approach. One comment on a Math Stack Exchange post explicitly states that there are infinitely many continuous solutions and outlines a similar construction method: \"pick a<0, and 'pick' a continuous, increasing and surjective function f:]−∞,a]→]a,0]\". This is slightly different from my construction but relies on the same principle of having a \"free choice\" for the function over a certain interval, which then determines the rest of the function. The number of ways to choose such a function is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nMy reasoning that the number of choices for the initial function segment is $\\mathfrak{c}$ and the number of choices for the parameter $a$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$ leads to a total of $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$ solutions. This is consistent with the search results that mention \"infinitely many\" solutions, and my analysis provides the specific cardinality.\n\nTherefore, the final conclusion is that the set of such functions has the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nFinal check of the argument:\n1.  A solution $f$ must be continuous and injective, hence strictly monotonic.\n2.  If $f$ is strictly decreasing, let $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = a$. Then $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = f(a)$. But $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\exp(x) = \\infty$. Thus $f(a) = \\infty$, which is impossible for a real-valued function. So, no decreasing solutions exist.\n3.  If $f$ is strictly increasing, it must have a unique root $a<0$. The function can be constructed by choosing such an $a$ (there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices) and then choosing a continuous, strictly increasing bijection from $[a, 0]$ to $[0, e^a]$ (there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for this bijection). The function is then uniquely determined over $\\mathbb{R}$. The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices, which is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and supported by the literature found.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nHere is a summary of the argument:\n\n1.  **Injectivity and Monotonicity**: If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, any solution $f$ must be an injective function. A continuous injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n2.  **Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n    If $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its limit as $x$ approaches infinity must exist. Let $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = a$. The value $a$ can be a real number or $-\\infty$.\n    Let's consider the limit of the given equation as $x \\to \\infty$:\n    $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\exp(x) = \\infty$.\n    Now, let $y = f(x)$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $y$ approaches $a$ from above (since $f$ is decreasing). So, we can rewrite the limit as:\n    $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = \\infty$.\n    Since $f$ is a continuous function defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, this limit must be equal to $f(a)$. However, a real-valued function cannot take the value $\\infty$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions.\n\n3.  **Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n    It can be shown that any strictly increasing continuous solution must have the following properties:\n    *   There exists a unique real number $a < 0$ such that $f(a) = 0$.\n    *   The function can be constructed by first choosing such a number $a$.\n    *   Then, one must define $f$ on the interval $[a, 0]$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous, and we know $f(a)=0$ and can deduce $f(0) = f(f(a)) = e^a$, we need to define a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ that maps the interval $[a, 0]$ to the interval $[0, e^a]$.\n    *   The function $f$ can then be uniquely extended to the entire real line using the original equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ and the derived property $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$.\n\n4.  **Cardinality of the Solution Set**:\n    The construction of a solution depends on two choices:\n    *   The choice of the real number $a$ from the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n    *   For each choice of $a$, the choice of a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ from $[a, 0]$ to $[0, e^a]$. The set of such functions also has the cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n    Since each unique pair of choices $(a, \\phi)$ defines a unique solution $f$, the total number of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of these sets of choices. The cardinality of the set of solutions is therefore $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThus, there are uncountably many such continuous functions, and their quantity is precisely the cardinality of the real numbers.\n>>>"
