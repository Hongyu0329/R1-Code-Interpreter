The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\mathbb{R}|$.

Here is a summary of the argument:

1.  **Injectivity and Monotonicity**: If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\exp(x_1) = \exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, any solution $f$ must be an injective function. A continuous injective function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).

2.  **Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**
    If $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\mathbb{R}$, its limit as $x$ approaches infinity must exist. Let $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = a$. The value $a$ can be a real number or $-\infty$.
    Let's consider the limit of the given equation as $x \to \infty$:
    $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(f(x)) = \lim_{x\to\infty} \exp(x) = \infty$.
    Now, let $y = f(x)$. As $x \to \infty$, $y$ approaches $a$ from above (since $f$ is decreasing). So, we can rewrite the limit as:
    $\lim_{y\to a^+} f(y) = \infty$.
    Since $f$ is a continuous function defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, this limit must be equal to $f(a)$. However, a real-valued function cannot take the value $\infty$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions.

3.  **Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**
    It can be shown that any strictly increasing continuous solution must have the following properties:
    *   There exists a unique real number $a < 0$ such that $f(a) = 0$.
    *   The function can be constructed by first choosing such a number $a$.
    *   Then, one must define $f$ on the interval $[a, 0]$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous, and we know $f(a)=0$ and can deduce $f(0) = f(f(a)) = e^a$, we need to define a continuous, strictly increasing function $\phi$ that maps the interval $[a, 0]$ to the interval $[0, e^a]$.
    *   The function $f$ can then be uniquely extended to the entire real line using the original equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ and the derived property $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$.

4.  **Cardinality of the Solution Set**:
    The construction of a solution depends on two choices:
    *   The choice of the real number $a$ from the interval $(-\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is $\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).
    *   For each choice of $a$, the choice of a continuous, strictly increasing function $\phi$ from $[a, 0]$ to $[0, e^a]$. The set of such functions also has the cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$.

    Since each unique pair of choices $(a, \phi)$ defines a unique solution $f$, the total number of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of these sets of choices. The cardinality of the set of solutions is therefore $\mathfrak{c} \times \mathfrak{c} = \mathfrak{c}$.

Thus, there are uncountably many such continuous functions, and their quantity is precisely the cardinality of the real numbers.
