The ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize catalytic performance is dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, optimal ratios have been reported in the range of 7% molar Ni to 12.5 wt% Ni, and a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 2:7 in certain mixed oxides. For water splitting, a higher Ni content with Ni/Ce ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 is favorable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while a lower Ni content with a Ni/Ce ratio of 1:2 is optimal for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).
