    "An isometric embedding of a metric space (X, d) into a normed space (B, ||·||) is a map *f*: X → B such that for all x, y in X, the equality ||*f*(x) - *f*(y)|| = d(x, y) holds. The question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings for a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n\nThe number of possible isometric embeddings can be zero. This occurs when the geometric structure of the Banach space B cannot accommodate the metric structure of the space X. A classic example of this situation, which also applies to ultrametric spaces, is the attempt to embed a four-point equilateral space into a low-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nConsider the finite ultrametric space X = {x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄} where the distance d(xᵢ, xⱼ) = 1 for any i ≠ j, and d(xᵢ, xᵢ) = 0. This is known as an equilateral or uniform metric space, and it satisfies the ultrametric inequality d(x, z) ≤ max(d(x, y), d(y, z)).\n\nLet the Banach space B be the 2-dimensional Euclidean space ℝ² with the standard norm ||v|| = √(v₁² + v₂²). An isometric embedding of X into B would require finding four points in the plane that are all at a distance of 1 from each other. This is equivalent to finding the vertices of a regular tetrahedron in a two-dimensional plane. Such a construction is not possible. If three of the points form an equilateral triangle, the fourth point cannot be at a distance of 1 from all three other vertices simultaneously.\n\nSince there exists a valid finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B for which there are no isometric embeddings, the set of such embeddings is empty. The number of elements in an empty set is 0. As the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\nIt is worth noting that while an embedding into an *arbitrary* Banach space is not guaranteed, every finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into *some* Banach space, for instance, into an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space or the space of bounded functions on X. However, the question concerns a given, arbitrary Banach space B, which may not have the necessary properties for such an embedding to exist.\n\n<<<0>>>"
