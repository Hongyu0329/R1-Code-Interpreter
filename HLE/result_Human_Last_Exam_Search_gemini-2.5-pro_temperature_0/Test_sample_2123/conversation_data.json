    "In the Russian writer Yuri Olesha's book \"Not a Day Without a Line\" (*Ни дня без строчки*), there is a passage describing Vienna. When depicting people strolling along the boulevards, the Russian text reads \"гулять по бульварам\" (gulyat' po bul'varam).\n\nThe Russian preposition \"по\" (po), which means \"along\" or \"on,\" is spelled and pronounced the same as the surname of the American poet Edgar Allan Poe. Olesha himself noted this linguistic coincidence in his work. While Poe was an American poet, the question uses \"English\" in the broader sense of an English-language writer.\n\n<<<Poe>>>"
