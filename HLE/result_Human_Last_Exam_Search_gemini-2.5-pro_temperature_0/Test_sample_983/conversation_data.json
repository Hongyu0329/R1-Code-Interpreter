    "The next number in the sequence is 2358.\n\nThe provided sequence is:\n1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352\n\nFirst, we can observe that all numbers in the sequence are divisible by 6. We can verify this by checking that they are all even and the sum of their digits is divisible by 3.\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n*   1020 - 1014 = 6\n*   1032 - 1020 = 12\n*   1050 - 1032 = 18\n*   1104 - 1050 = 54\n*   1224 - 1104 = 120\n*   1230 - 1224 = 6\n*   1290 - 1230 = 60\n*   1410 - 1290 = 120\n*   1440 - 1410 = 30\n*   1452 - 1440 = 12\n*   1482 - 1452 = 30\n*   1500 - 1482 = 18\n*   1512 - 1500 = 12\n*   1560 - 1512 = 48\n*   1584 - 1560 = 24\n*   1602 - 1584 = 18\n*   1734 - 1602 = 132\n*   1812 - 1734 = 78\n*   1890 - 1812 = 78\n*   1902 - 1890 = 12\n*   1932 - 1902 = 30\n*   1974 - 1932 = 42\n*   2004 - 1974 = 30\n*   2040 - 2004 = 36\n*   2064 - 2040 = 24\n*   2070 - 2064 = 6\n*   2130 - 2070 = 60\n*   2142 - 2130 = 12\n*   2274 - 2142 = 132\n*   2340 - 2274 = 66\n*   2352 - 2340 = 12\n\nThe sequence of differences is: 6, 12, 18, 54, 120, 6, 60, 120, 30, 12, 30, 18, 12, 48, 24, 18, 132, 78, 78, 12, 30, 42, 30, 36, 24, 6, 60, 12, 132, 66, 12.\n\nLet's focus on the last few differences: 132, 66, 12.\nWe can observe a pattern of division. The difference of 66 is half of the previous difference of 132 (132 / 2 = 66).\nWhile the subsequent difference of 12 does not follow a simple division from 66, it is possible that the pattern of halving the difference reappears. If we halve the last difference of 12, we get 6.\n\nIf the next difference is 6, the next number in the sequence would be:\n2352 + 6 = 2358.\n\nThis potential next term, 2358, is also divisible by 6 (since it is even and the sum of its digits, 2+3+5+8=18, is divisible by 3), which is consistent with the rest of the sequence.\n\nThus, the most plausible next number is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
