A functional MRI receiving coil may not show resonance when probed with a magnetic loop antenna for several reasons, the most common being that the coil is in an actively detuned state. This is a deliberate design feature to prevent the coil from interacting with the MRI's transmit pulses. Other possibilities include the coil having a very low quality factor (Q-factor), leading to a broad and shallow resonance that is difficult to detect, poor magnetic coupling between the probe and the coil, or the coil having a specialized non-resonant design. To properly test such a coil, one must ensure its detuning circuit is inactive and optimize the coupling of the measurement probe.
