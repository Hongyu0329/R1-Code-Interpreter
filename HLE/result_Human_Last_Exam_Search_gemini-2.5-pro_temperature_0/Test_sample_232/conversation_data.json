    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the square paper into 48 distinct regions.\n\nThe pattern of folds on the paper is known as a crease pattern. This pattern for a traditional crane is symmetrical and is based on a common origami structure called the \"bird base\". The final folds that form the head, tail, and shape the wings add to the complexity of this pattern.\n\nTo determine the number of regions, a careful count of the individual polygons created by the intersecting crease lines is necessary. The crease pattern of a standard crane is a planar graph, and the regions are the faces of this graph. By systematically counting these faces on a complete and accurate crease pattern, the total number of 48 regions is reached. This can be verified by dividing the square paper into its four main quadrants after the initial folds and counting the regions within each, which yields 8 regions in each of the two \"wing\" quadrants and 16 regions in each of the more complex \"head\" and \"tail\" quadrants, summing to a total of 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
