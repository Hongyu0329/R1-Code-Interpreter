A single-site catalyst comprising a Group IV metal, specifically zirconium or hafnium, supported on sulfated alumina (AlS) and derived from a neopentyl precursor, is the optimal combination. This system can function as an efficient olefin polymerization catalyst in the absence of hydrogen and subsequently, in the presence of hydrogen and at elevated temperatures, as a highly active catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of the produced polyolefin into short saturated alkanes.
