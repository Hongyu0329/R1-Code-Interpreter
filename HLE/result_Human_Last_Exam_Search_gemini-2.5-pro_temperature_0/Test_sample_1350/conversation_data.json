    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is an unnamed old Wolfing warrior who describes visiting a Roman city and their religious practices, making a clear allusion to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nIn Chapter IV, \"The House Fareth to the War,\" as the Wolfing men prepare for battle against the invading Romans, the conversation turns to the nature of their enemy. An elderly warrior, who had traveled in his youth and spent time among the \"Welsh\" (the term the Goths used for foreigners), recounts what he has learned. He describes the Romans' walled cities of stone and their immense wealth.\n\nCrucially, he then speaks of their worship and their standard: \"they have a she-wolf for a standard, and they bear the image of a she-wolf on their banner, because they say that the first father of their folk was nourished by a she-wolf in the wilderness.\" This is a direct reference to the foundational myth of Rome, in which the twin brothers Romulus and Remus were abandoned and then suckled by a she-wolf. The \"first father of their folk\" that the warrior mentions is a clear reference to Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome.\n\n<<<An unnamed old Wolfing warrior>>>"
