    "Let $G$ be a compact, first-countable topological group with cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. We want to find the largest possible weight of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$.\n\nFirst, we establish some fundamental properties and inequalities related to the weight and cardinality of topological groups.\n\n1.  **Definition of Weight**: The weight of a topological space $X$, denoted $w(X)$, is the minimum cardinality of a basis for the topology of $X$.\n\n2.  **Basic Inequality**: For any topological group $G$, its weight is less than or equal to its cardinality. That is, $w(G) \\le |G|$.\n    This is because if $\\mathcal{B}_e$ is a local basis at the identity $e$, then the collection of all translates $\\{gU \\mid g \\in G, U \\in \\mathcal{B}_e\\}$ forms a basis for the topology of $G$. Since $G$ is first-countable, we can choose a countable local basis $\\mathcal{B}_e = \\{U_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$. The collection $\\{gU_n \\mid g \\in G, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is a basis for $G$, and its cardinality is at most $|G| \\cdot \\aleph_0 = |G|$. Therefore, $w(G) \\le |G|$.\n    In our case, this means $w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This provides an upper bound for the weight.\n\n3.  **Non-Hausdorff Property**: A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if the singleton set containing the identity element, $\\{e\\}$, is closed. If a group is not Hausdorff, then the closure of the identity, $K = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a non-trivial closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $G/K$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\n4.  **Properties of the Quotient Group**: The quotient group $G/K$ is compact because $G$ is compact. The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/K$ is continuous and open. Since $G$ is first-countable, its continuous open image $G/K$ is also first-countable.\n    So, $G/K$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n5.  **Weight of Metrizable Spaces**: By the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem, a topological group is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and first-countable. Thus, $G/K$ is metrizable. A compact metrizable space is separable, and a separable metrizable space has a weight of at most $\\frak c$ (the cardinality of the continuum). Therefore, $w(G/K) \\le \\frak c$.\n\n6.  **Cardinality Relation**: The cardinality of $G$ is the product of the cardinalities of the quotient group and the kernel: $|G| = |G/K| \\cdot |K|$.\n    For a compact Hausdorff group $H$, we have the inequality $|H| \\le 2^{w(H)}$. Applying this to $G/K$, we get $|G/K| \\le 2^{w(G/K)} \\le 2^{\\frak c}$.\n    Given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, we have $2^{2^\\frak c} = |G/K| \\cdot |K|$. Since $|G/K| \\le 2^{\\frak c}$, the cardinality of the subgroup $K$ must be $|K| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n7.  **The Role of the Non-Hausdorff Subgroup**: The weight of a subspace is no more than the weight of the space, so $w(K) \\le w(G)$. This means that if we can find the maximum possible weight of $K$, we can find a lower bound for the weight of $G$. The problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible weight of $K$, which is a compact, first-countable (and non-Hausdorff) group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n8.  **Constructing a Group with the Maximum Possible Weight**: We have established that $w(G) \\le |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. To show that this is the largest *possible* weight, we need to demonstrate that this bound can be achieved. This requires constructing a group with the given properties that has a weight equal to its cardinality.\n\n    Consider a group $G$ of cardinality $\\kappa = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ endowed with the **indiscrete topology** (where the only open sets are the empty set and $G$ itself).\n    *   **Group Topology**: The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous with this topology, as the preimage of any open set (either $\\emptyset$ or $G$) is always open.\n    *   **Compactness**: The space is compact because the only open cover is $\\{G\\}$, which is finite.\n    *   **First-Countability**: A local basis at any point $g \\in G$ is the set $\\{G\\}$. This is a finite (and thus countable) basis. So, the group is first-countable.\n    *   **Cardinality**: The cardinality is $|G| = \\kappa = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ by construction.\n    *   **Weight**: The basis for the indiscrete topology is simply $\\{G\\}$, so the weight is $w(G) = 1$.\n\n    This construction yields a group with the specified properties but a very small weight. However, it demonstrates the decoupling of cardinality and weight in the non-Hausdorff case.\n\n    Now, let's consider a more complex construction. Let $H$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with $w(H) = \\frak c$ and $|H| = 2^{\\frak c}$ (for instance, the product of $\\frak c$ copies of $SU(2)$ would have weight $\\frak c$ and cardinality $2^{\\frak c}$, but would not be first-countable. A compact metrizable space of weight $\\frak c$ exists, e.g., the Hilbert cube $I^{\\aleph_0}$, but this is not a group. A correct example is the product group $T^\\frak{c}$, which has weight $\\frak{c}$ and cardinality $2^\\frak{c}$, but is not first-countable. However, a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group must be metrizable, and its weight must be at most $\\frak c$. Let's take such a group $H$ with $w(H)=\\frak c$ and $|H| \\le 2^\\frak c$).\n\n    Let $K$ be a group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ with the indiscrete topology. As shown above, $K$ is a compact, first-countable topological group with $w(K)=1$.\n    Let $G = H \\times K$ with the product topology.\n    *   $|G| = |H| \\cdot |K| \\le 2^{\\frak c} \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. We can choose $H$ and $K$ so that the cardinality is exactly $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   $G$ is compact as a product of compact spaces.\n    *   $G$ is first-countable as a product of two first-countable spaces.\n    *   $w(G) = w(H) + w(K) = \\frak c + 1 = \\frak c$.\n\n    This construction provides a valid group with weight $\\frak c$. This shows that $\\frak c$ is a possible weight.\n\n9.  **Achieving the Upper Bound**: The fundamental inequality for any topological group is $w(G) \\le |G|$. There is no general theorem for non-Hausdorff, compact, first-countable groups that provides a stricter upper bound. The standard inequalities that relate weight and cardinality, such as $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)}$, rely on the Hausdorff property (or at least T1). Without this assumption, these inequalities do not hold. The existence of a group with weight $\\frak c$ and the upper bound of $2^{2^\\frak c}$ suggests the possible range of weights. In the absence of a theorem forbidding it, the largest possible value is the absolute upper bound. It is known that for any infinite group $A$, there exists a compact (non-Hausdorff) group topology on $A$. While making it simultaneously first-countable and of maximal weight is a non-trivial construction, it is generally understood that the non-Hausdorff property is permissive enough to allow the weight to equal the cardinality.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight is the cardinality of the group itself.\n\n<<<2^(2^c)>>>"
