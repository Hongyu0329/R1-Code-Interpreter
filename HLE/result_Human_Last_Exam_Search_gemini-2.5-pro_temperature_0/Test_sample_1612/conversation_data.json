    "## A Historic Fraternity: Unpacking the Number of MLB's Triple Crown Winners\n\nIn Major League Baseball, a total of **17** players have achieved the prestigious batting Triple Crown by leading their respective league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season. This exclusive list of baseball royalty expanded significantly in 2020 when MLB officially recognized the statistics of seven Negro Leagues that operated between 1920 and 1948 as Major League records.\n\nPrior to this historic decision, only 10 players were credited with winning the Triple Crown in the American and National Leagues. The inclusion of Negro League greats has rightfully added to this celebrated fraternity.\n\nThe complete list of MLB Triple Crown winners is as follows:\n\n**American League:**\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909), Detroit Tigers\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933), Philadelphia Athletics\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934), New York Yankees\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947), Boston Red Sox\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956), New York Yankees\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966), Baltimore Orioles\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967), Boston Red Sox\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012), Detroit Tigers\n\n**National League:**\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878), Providence Grays\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887), St. Louis Browns (American Association)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894), Boston Beaneaters\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901), Philadelphia Athletics\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912), Chicago Cubs\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925), St. Louis Cardinals\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933), Philadelphia Phillies\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937), St. Louis Cardinals\n\n**Negro Leagues:**\n*   **Oscar Charleston** (1921, 1924, 1925), St. Louis Giants/Harrisburg Giants\n*   **Heavy Johnson** (1923), Kansas City Monarchs\n*   **Mule Suttles** (1926), St. Louis Stars\n*   **Willie Wells** (1930), St. Louis Stars\n*   **Josh Gibson** (1936, 1937), Pittsburgh Crawfords/Homestead Grays\n*   **Lennie Pearson** (1942), Newark Eagles\n*   **Ted Strong** (1942), Kansas City Monarchs\n\nFour players have accomplished the remarkable feat of winning the Triple Crown multiple times. Oscar Charleston stands alone with three Triple Crowns. Rogers Hornsby, Ted Williams, and Josh Gibson have each won the award twice.\n\nThe most recent player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, ending a 45-year drought in the American and National Leagues.\n\n<<<17>>>"
