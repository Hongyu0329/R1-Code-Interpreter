    "The search results confirm that \"randomized uniform gossiping\" most commonly refers to a node-centric model. Specifically, at each step, a node is chosen uniformly at random from the entire network and is activated. This activated node then chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to communicate with. This aligns perfectly with the initial assumption I made.\n\nLet's formalize the calculation based on this confirmed model.\n\n### Graph Structure\n*   **Total Nodes (n):** 10\n*   **Structure:** A barbell graph, which consists of two identical, fully connected cliques joined by a single edge, known as the bottleneck or bridge edge.\n*   **Cliques:** With 10 nodes total, each clique (`C1` and `C2`) must have `k = 5` nodes.\n*   **Bottleneck Edge:** Let's say this edge connects node `u` from `C1` and node `v` from `C2`.\n\n### Node Degrees\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.\n*   **Nodes at the ends of the bottleneck (u and v):** Each of these two nodes is connected to `k-1 = 4` other nodes within its own clique and to 1 node in the other clique via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Degree `d(u) = d(v) = (5-1) + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Other nodes:** The remaining `n-2 = 8` nodes are each connected only to the other `k-1 = 4` nodes within their respective cliques.\n    *   Degree for these 8 nodes is `4`.\n\n### The Gossiping Process\nThe process for sampling an edge in one step of randomized uniform gossiping is as follows:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the `n=10` nodes. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/n = 1/10`.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with. The edge between them is considered \"sampled\".\n\n### Calculating the Probability\nWe want to find the probability that the bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled. This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  Node `u` is selected and it chooses to contact node `v`.\n2.  Node `v` is selected and it chooses to contact node `u`.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of each case:\n\n*   **Case 1: Node `u` is selected and chooses `v`**\n    *   The probability of selecting node `u` is `P(u) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given that `u` is selected, it has `d(u) = 5` neighbors. It chooses one uniformly at random. The probability of it choosing `v` is `1/d(u) = 1/5`.\n    *   The total probability for this case is `P(u is selected) * P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Case 2: Node `v` is selected and chooses `u`**\n    *   The probability of selecting node `v` is `P(v) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given that `v` is selected, it has `d(v) = 5` neighbors. The probability of it choosing `u` is `1/d(v) = 1/5`.\n    *   The total probability for this case is `P(v is selected) * P(v chooses u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases:\n\n`P(bottleneck edge is sampled) = P(Case 1) + P(Case 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nConverting this to a decimal, the probability is `1 / 25 = 0.04`.\n\nThe search results also discuss how the low probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is a key reason for the slow convergence of uniform gossip algorithms on barbell graphs. This reinforces the understanding that this probability is expected to be small.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and based on the confirmed definition of the gossiping model. No further information is needed.\n\nFinal Answer: The probability is 1/25.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
