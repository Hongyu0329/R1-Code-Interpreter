    "**The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is a glyph representing \"7 Deer,\" discovered on mural fragments in the Las Pinturas pyramid at San Bartolo, Guatemala.** These fragments, attributed to the Maya civilization, have been securely dated to between 300 and 200 B.C.E.\n\nThis \"7 Deer\" notation is a day in the 260-day divinatory calendar, a calendrical system used throughout Mesoamerica and still in use by some indigenous Maya communities today. The discovery is significant as it pushes back the earliest evidence of the Maya calendar by several centuries. The mural fragments on which the date is found also reveal an established writing tradition with various scribal hands, suggesting the system was in use for some time before this specific inscription was made.\n\nWhile the Olmec civilization is credited with the earliest known writing system in the Americas, exemplified by the Cascajal Block dated to around 900 B.C.E., this artifact does not contain any known calendrical information. The 62 glyphs on the block are considered to represent a script but not a recorded date.\n\nOther early dated inscriptions in the Americas include:\n\n*   **Zapotec script:** A carved stone, known as Monument 3, from San Jos√© Mogote, Oaxaca, features glyphs that may represent a name. It was initially dated to 500-600 B.C.E., but this dating has been questioned by some scholars.\n*   **Epi-Olmec script:** The Chiapa de Corzo stela, found in Chiapas, Mexico, bears a Long Count calendar date corresponding to December 36 B.C.E., making it the earliest known date in that specific calendrical system.\n\nHowever, the \"7 Deer\" glyph from San Bartolo predates the Chiapa de Corzo stela's inscription by at least a century and a half, making it the definitive earliest recorded date found to date in the Americas.\n\n<<<The earliest known recorded date by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas is the \"7 Deer\" glyph, found on Maya mural fragments in San Bartolo, Guatemala, dated to 300-200 B.C.E.>>>"
