    "When a curve of genus 4, defined over a valuation field, has a Jacobian with good reduction, the special fiber of its stable model must be a stable curve of \"compact type\". This means its dual graph is a tree. This is a known consequence of the theory of reduction of abelian varieties, as good reduction for the Jacobian implies that the component group of its special fiber is trivial, which in turn forces the first Betti number of the dual graph of the curve's stable reduction to be zero.\n\nA stable curve's arithmetic genus `g` is related to the geometric genera `g_v` of its components and the topology of its dual graph `Γ` by the formula:\n`g = h¹(Γ) + Σ g_v`\nwhere `h¹(Γ)` is the first Betti number of the graph (the number of independent cycles) and the sum is over all vertices `v` of the graph.\n\nFurthermore, the Jacobian of a stable curve of compact type (where `h¹(Γ) = 0`) is the product of the Jacobians of its components. The dimension of the Jacobian is the sum of the genera of the components.\n\nFor a genus 4 curve, `g=4`. The condition that the Jacobian has good reduction implies `h¹(Γ) = 0` (a tree-like dual graph) and that the dimension of the Jacobian of the special fiber is also 4. This leads to the condition:\n`Σ g_v = 4`\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the number of distinct types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 4 whose components' genera sum to 4 and whose dual graph is a tree. A curve type is defined by the set of genera of its components and the structure of their dual graph. The stability condition requires that any component that is a rational curve (genus 0) must connect to other components at 3 or more points (i.e., the corresponding vertex in the dual graph must have a degree of at least 3).\n\nWe can classify the types by the number of components, `n`:\n\n*   **n = 1:** The curve is irreducible. The only way for the genera to sum to 4 is if the single component has genus 4. For the dual graph to be a tree, the curve must have no nodes. This corresponds to a **smooth curve of genus 4**. (1 type)\n\n*   **n = 2:** The components have genera `(g₁, g₂)` such that `g₁ + g₂ = 4`. The dual graph is a simple line segment. For the curve to be stable, no component can be a rational curve (as the vertices have degree 1).\n    *   Genera (3, 1): A genus 3 curve and a genus 1 curve meeting at a node. This is stable. (1 type)\n    *   Genera (2, 2): Two genus 2 curves meeting at a node. This is stable. (1 type)\n\n*   **n = 3:** The components have genera `(g₁, g₂, g₃)` such that `g₁ + g₂ + g₃ = 4`. The dual graph is a tree with 3 vertices (which is always a line). No component can be rational, as the maximum degree of a vertex is 2. The only partition of 4 into 3 positive integers is (2, 1, 1).\n    *   Genera (2, 1, 1): The components are a genus 2 curve and two genus 1 curves. There are two distinct arrangements on a line: the genus 2 curve can be in the middle or at an end. Both are stable. (2 types)\n\n*   **n = 4:** The components' genera sum to 4. The dual graph is a tree with 4 vertices (either a path `P₄` or a star `K₁,₃`).\n    *   Genera (1, 1, 1, 1): No rational components, so any tree is stable. The two distinct tree structures (`P₄` and `K₁,₃`) give two different types. (2 types)\n    *   Genera (2, 1, 1, 0): One rational component. This component must have a degree of at least 3. This is only possible if the graph is the star `K₁,₃` and the rational component is the central vertex. This is a stable configuration. (1 type)\n\n*   **n = 5:** The components' genera sum to 4. The dual graph is a tree with 5 vertices. Any partition must include at least one rational component.\n    *   Genera (1, 1, 1, 1, 0): One rational component, which must be at a vertex of degree ≥ 3. There are two non-isomorphic trees on 5 vertices with such a vertex: the star graph `K₁,₄` (center has degree 4) and another tree with a maximum degree of 3. Both configurations are stable. (2 types)\n\n*   **n = 6:** The components' genera sum to 4. Any partition must include at least two rational components, requiring at least two vertices of degree ≥ 3.\n    *   Genera (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0): Two rational components. There is a unique tree on 6 vertices that has two vertices of degree 3 (and four of degree 1). Placing the two rational components at the degree-3 vertices and the four genus-1 components at the leaves yields a stable curve. (1 type)\n\n*   **n ≥ 7:** A partition of 4 into `n` parts must have at least `n-4` zeros. For `n=7`, this means at least 3 rational components, requiring 3 vertices of degree ≥ 3. The sum of degrees in a tree with 7 vertices is 12. If three vertices have degree ≥ 3 and the other four have degree ≥ 1, the sum of degrees would be at least 3+3+3+1+1+1+1 = 13, which is impossible. Thus, no such stable curves exist for `n ≥ 7`.\n\nSumming up the possibilities:\n*   n=1: 1 type\n*   n=2: 2 types\n*   n=3: 2 types\n*   n=4: 3 types\n*   n=5: 2 types\n*   n=6: 1 type\n\nTotal: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves defined over a valuation field under the assumption that the Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n<<<11>>>"
