    "A finite group *G* is termed a **filled group** if all of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fill the entire group. A subset *S* of a group *G* is considered **product-free** if for all elements *a* and *b* in *S*, their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is **maximal by inclusion** if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. Finally, a set *S* **fills** *G* if every non-identity element of *G* is either in *S* or can be expressed as a product of two elements from *S*.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups has been established through the work of several mathematicians, notably Street, Whitehead, Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart. A finite nilpotent group is a direct product of its Sylow *p*-subgroups. For a finite nilpotent group to be filled, it must be a *p*-group for some prime *p*. Specifically, a filled nilpotent group must be either a 2-group, the cyclic group of order 3 (C₃), or the cyclic group of order 5 (C₅).\n\nThe complete classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is as follows:\n\n*   **Abelian Filled Groups:** A finite abelian group is filled if and only if it is an elementary abelian 2-group (a group isomorphic to a direct product of copies of the cyclic group of order 2, C₂), C₃, or C₅.\n\n*   **Non-Abelian Filled 2-Groups:** The non-abelian filled 2-groups are:\n    *   The dihedral group of order 8, denoted as D₈.\n    *   The direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as D₈ × C₂.\n    *   The central product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the quaternion group of order 8, denoted as D₈ ∗ Q₈.\n    *   The direct product of the central product of D₈ and Q₈ with the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.\n\nTherefore, a finite nilpotent group *G* is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following:\n*   An elementary abelian 2-group.\n*   The cyclic group of order 3 (C₃).\n*   The cyclic group of order 5 (C₅).\n*   The dihedral group of order 8 (D₈).\n*   D₈ × C₂.\n*   D₈ ∗ Q₈.\n*   (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is filled if and only if G is an elementary abelian 2-group, C₃, C₅, D₈, D₈ × C₂, D₈ ∗ Q₈, or (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.>>>"
