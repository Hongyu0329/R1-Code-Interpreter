The scanned material is a mixture of monoclinic and tetragonal Zirconia (ZrO₂). The unit cell structure is a combination of monoclinic (P2₁/c) and tetragonal (P4₂/nmc). The approximate lattice constants are a ≈ 5.14 Å, b ≈ 5.21 Å, c ≈ 5.31 Å, β ≈ 99.2° for the monoclinic phase, and a = b ≈ 3.64 Å, c ≈ 5.27 Å for the tetragonal phase.
