    "To determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we first need to determine the Galois group of the splitting field $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**1. Analyze the Polynomial**\n\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can factor this polynomial by grouping terms:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Let these be $K_g$ and $K_h$, respectively.\n\n**2. Determine the Galois Group of Each Factor**\n\n*   **For $h(x) = x^2 - 2$**: The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which is a normal extension of degree 2. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (which we denote as $C_2$).\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**:\n    *   **Irreducibility**: Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$, since 3 divides the coefficients -9 and 3, but not the leading coefficient 1, and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Number of Real Roots**: The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are $x = \\pm\\sqrt{9/5}$.\n        *   $g(\\sqrt{9/5}) = (9/5)\\sqrt{9/5} - 9\\sqrt{9/5} + 3 = -\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt{9/5} + 3 < 0$.\n        *   $g(-\\sqrt{9/5}) = -(9/5)\\sqrt{9/5} + 9\\sqrt{9/5} + 3 = \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt{9/5} + 3 > 0$.\n        Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and thus two complex conjugate roots.\n    *   **Galois Group**: For an irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, having exactly three real roots implies that its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_5$. Thus, $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, and $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**3. Determine the Galois Group of the Splitting Field K**\n\nThe Galois group of $K = K_g K_h$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Its structure is determined by the intersection of the fields $K_g$ and $K_h$.\n$[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_g \\cap K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]} = \\frac{120 \\cdot 2}{[K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]}$.\n\nThe intersection $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it were $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ would be a quadratic subfield of $K_g$. By Galois theory, a quadratic subfield must be the fixed field of a subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$. The only subgroup of $S_5$ of index 2 is the alternating group $A_5$. The field fixed by $A_5$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\n\nThe discriminant of a polynomial of the form $x^n + ax + b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$.\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14,863,419$.\nFor $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we would need $D/2$ to be the square of a rational number. Since $D$ is a negative integer, this is impossible. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThis implies that $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe degree of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n**4. Find Degrees of Normal Intermediate Extensions**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{1\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not limited to products of normal subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$. However, they can be fully characterized.\n\nThe proper, non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $S_5 \\times C_2$ are:\n1.  **Product Subgroups**:\n    *   $H_1 = S_5 \\times \\{1\\}$: $|H_1| = 120$. The index is $[G:H_1] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_2 = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H_2| = 60 \\times 2 = 120$. The index is $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = A_5 \\times \\{1\\}$: $|H_3| = 60$. The index is $[G:H_3] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H_4| = 2$. The index is $[G:H_4] = 240/2 = 120$.\n\n2.  **Diagonal Subgroup**: There exists a normal subgroup arising from the isomorphism $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. This subgroup is $H_5 = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g) = c\\}$, where we identify $C_2$ with the multiplicative group $\\{1, -1\\}$.\n    *   $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$. The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe possible orders for proper non-trivial normal subgroups are 2, 60, and 120. The corresponding indices (which are the degrees of the normal extensions) are:\n*   For $|H|=2$, the degree is $240/2 = 120$.\n*   For $|H|=60$, the degree is $240/60 = 4$.\n*   For $|H|=120$, the degree is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThus, the set of all possible degrees for such extensions $L$ is {2, 4, 120}.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
