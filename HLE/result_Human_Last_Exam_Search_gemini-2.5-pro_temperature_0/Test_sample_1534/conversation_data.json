    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a part of the posterior subesophageal mass, a collection of brain structures that control various motor functions. This region of the cuttlefish brain is encased in cartilage on its posterior side.\n\nAnatomical studies and 3D brain atlases of the dwarf cuttlefish have identified a \"palliovisceral lobe complex\" which, in addition to the palliovisceral lobe itself, includes several other lobes that are situated in the posterior part of the brain. The posterior region of the subesophageal mass specifically contains the palliovisceral lobe, the posterior chromatophore lobes, and the fin lobes.\n\nBased on 3D reconstructions of the dwarf cuttlefish brain, the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes are located in close proximity to and generally behind the palliovisceral lobe. The palliovisceral lobe is involved in controlling escape movements and the expulsion of ink. The adjacent posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores on the mantle, which are crucial for the cuttlefish's remarkable ability to change its skin color and patterns for camouflage and communication. The fin lobes, also located posteriorly, control the movement of the fins.\n\nOther lobes within the palliovisceral lobe complex include the lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes, whose precise spatial relationship to the palliovisceral lobe from a strictly posterior viewpoint is also very close within this compact neural structure.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
