    "Unfortunately, after a thorough search of available written materials, including performance reviews, ballet forum discussions, and articles about Natalia Osipova's 2008 performances of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet, the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position she performed in the Act I variation could not be determined.\n\nNumerous sources confirm that Natalia Osipova, then a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, performed the role of Kitri in *Don Quixote* in 2008, both with the company and as a guest artist. Reviews from the time and later retrospectives consistently praise her for her technical brilliance and powerful turns in this role. Descriptions often refer to her performing \"multiple pirouettes\" and \"dizzying series of revolutions,\" but none provide a specific count of the particular ballet step mentioned in the user's query.\n\nWhile video recordings of her 2008 performances exist, a detailed choreographic analysis or breakdown that quantifies this specific sequence of steps is not available in the written record. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive number.\n\n<<<Not available>>>"
