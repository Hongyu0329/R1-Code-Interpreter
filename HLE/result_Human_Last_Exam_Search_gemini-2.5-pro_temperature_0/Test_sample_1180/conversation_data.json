    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ above 2, we need to analyze the 2-adic properties of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\n\nThe structure of the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the clustering of the roots of the defining polynomial in the algebraic closure of the base field (in this case, $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}_2}$). The thickness of the nodes in the special fiber of the stable model is a function of the valuations of the differences between these roots.\n\nFirst, we determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1=0$ using the Newton polygon method. The polynomial has coefficients $a_5=2$, $a_3=2$, and $a_0=1$. The other coefficients are zero. The points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v(a_i))$, where $v$ is the 2-adic valuation.\nThe relevant points are:\n*   $(5, v(a_5)) = (5, v(2)) = (5, 1)$\n*   $(3, v(a_3)) = (3, v(2)) = (3, 1)$\n*   $(0, v(a_0)) = (0, v(1)) = (0, 0)$\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points forms the Newton polygon. It consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0, 0)$ to $(3, 1)$. The slope of this segment is $\\frac{1-0}{3-0} = \\frac{1}{3}$. The horizontal length of this segment is 3. This indicates that there are 3 roots of $f(x)$ with valuation equal to the negative of the slope, i.e., $v(e_i) = -1/3$.\n2.  A segment from $(3, 1)$ to $(5, 1)$. The slope of this segment is $\\frac{1-1}{5-3} = 0$. The horizontal length of this segment is 2. This indicates that there are 2 roots of $f(x)$ with valuation $v(e_j) = -0 = 0$.\n\nBased on their valuations, the five roots of $f(x)$ are partitioned into two clusters:\n*   Cluster A: A set of 3 roots, $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$, with $v(e_i) = -1/3$.\n*   Cluster B: A set of 2 roots, $\\{e_4, e_5\\}$, with $v(e_j) = 0$.\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve will have a special fiber with components corresponding to these clusters. Since there are two clusters, the components will be connected by a double point (a node). The thickness of this node is determined by the \"distance\" between the clusters.\n\nLet's consider a root $e_A$ from Cluster A and a root $e_B$ from Cluster B. The valuation of their difference is given by the property of non-archimedean valuations:\n$v(e_A - e_B) = \\min(v(e_A), v(e_B)) = \\min(-1/3, 0) = -1/3$.\n\nThe thickness of the double point, let's call it $d$, is related to the valuation of the resultant of the polynomials corresponding to the two clusters. Let $f_A(x) = (x-e_1)(x-e_2)(x-e_3)$ and $f_B(x) = (x-e_4)(x-e_5)$. The resultant is given by $\\mathrm{Res}(f_A, f_B) = \\prod_{i \\in A, j \\in B} (e_i - e_j)$.\n\nThe valuation of the resultant is:\n$v(\\mathrm{Res}(f_A, f_B)) = \\sum_{i \\in A, j \\in B} v(e_i - e_j)$\nThere are $|A| \\times |B| = 3 \\times 2 = 6$ terms in this sum. For each term, the valuation is $-1/3$.\n$v(\\mathrm{Res}(f_A, f_B)) = 6 \\times (-1/3) = -2$.\n\nThe thickness of the node connecting the two components is given by the formula:\n$d = -\\frac{1}{2} v(\\mathrm{Res}(f_A, f_B))$\nPlugging in the calculated value:\n$d = -\\frac{1}{2} (-2) = 1$.\n\nThe thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
