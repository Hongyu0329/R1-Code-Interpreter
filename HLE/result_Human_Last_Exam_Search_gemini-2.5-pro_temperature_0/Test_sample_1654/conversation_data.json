    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the protagonist, Police Superintendent Otchumyelov, is described with his greatcoat on five separate occasions. These descriptions, or the act of taking the coat off and putting it back on, serve as a powerful symbol for his shifting and fearful mentality as he navigates a chaotic situation.\n\nThe story opens with Otchumyelov \"wearing a new overcoat\". This initial description establishes his official status and sense of self-importance. However, as the identity of the dog's owner is debated among the crowd, Otchumyelov's behavior, and his relationship with his coat, begins to change.\n\nThe instances where the coat is mentioned are as follows:\n*   He is first seen \"wearing a new overcoat\".\n*   When he believes the dog might belong to the General, he feels hot and asks his subordinate, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin\".\n*   Upon hearing a conflicting opinion that the dog is not the General's, he feels a chill and is described as he \"wraps himself in his coat.\"\n*   When it is suggested again that the dog might be the General's brother's, he once more feels warm and exclaims, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin\".\n*   Finally, after the cook clarifies the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov, \"wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way across the square.\"\n\nThese repeated actions of removing and donning his coat are not random. They directly mirror his vacillating judgments about who is to blame for the incident with the dog. His primary concern is not justice, but rather siding with the person of higher social standing to avoid any negative repercussions for himself. The coat, therefore, becomes an external manifestation of his internal, chameleon-like changes in allegiance, driven by fear and sycophancy.\n\n<<<5>>>"
