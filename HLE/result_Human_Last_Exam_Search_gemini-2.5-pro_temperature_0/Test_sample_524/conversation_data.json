    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous continuum is a compact, connected metric space where for any two points, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps one point to the other. In the plane, these continua are classified into four distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\nThe classification of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua was a long-standing problem. The circle was long known to be such a continuum. In 1948, the pseudo-arc was shown to be another example, and in 1959, the circle of pseudo-arcs was added to the list. It was finally proven in 2014 by Hoehn and Oversteegen that the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs are the only three non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua up to homeomorphism.\n\nIn addition to these three non-degenerate continua, the single point is considered a degenerate continuum and is also a homogeneous planar continuum.\n\nTherefore, the four homeomorphism classes are:\n*   The point (degenerate continuum)\n*   The circle\n*   The pseudo-arc\n*   The circle of pseudo-arcs\n\n<<<4>>>"
