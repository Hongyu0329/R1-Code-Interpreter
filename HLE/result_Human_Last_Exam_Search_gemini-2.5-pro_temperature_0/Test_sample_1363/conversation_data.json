    "In the European Tango, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the fundamental techniques of the dance.\n\nThe primary reason for this lies in the unique characteristics of the Tango compared to the other ballroom dances listed. Dances like the Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep are swing dances that utilize continuous, flowing movements, CBM (Contrary Body Movement), sway, and foot swivel to execute turns. These techniques allow for the possibility of turning more than the prescribed amount for a figure, which is known as overturning.\n\nIn contrast, the European Tango is a staccato dance with a grounded look and no rise and fall. A core principle of Tango technique is the absence of foot swivel. Turns are created by the precise placement of the feet and the rotation of the body *between* steps, not by pivoting or swiveling on the supporting foot. The feet are placed, and then the body moves. Attempting to add more rotation to a Reverse Turn than the figure allows for would necessitate swiveling on the standing foot, which is a direct violation of this foundational Tango technique. While some Tango figures are described as \"overturned,\" these are distinct, named figures with their own specific choreography, not an overturning of a standard figure like the Reverse Turn.\n\n<<<C>>>"
