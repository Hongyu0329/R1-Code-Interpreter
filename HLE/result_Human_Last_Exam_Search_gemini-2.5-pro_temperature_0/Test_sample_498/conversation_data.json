If you look at your keyboard, the letters on the bottom row, from left to right, are Z, X, C, V, B, N, M.\n\nThe sequence you provided, ZXXCVYBN, appears to contain extra letters (\"X\" and \"Y\") that break the simple keyboard pattern. However, the underlying and most logical pattern is the order of keys on the keyboard. Following this pattern, the letter after N is M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
