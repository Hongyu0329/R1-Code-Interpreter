The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ exp(-Sₑ[ψ̄, ψ]), where the integral is over Grassmann-valued fields ψ̄ and ψ with anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time τ ∈ [0, β], and Sₑ is the Euclidean action of the system.
