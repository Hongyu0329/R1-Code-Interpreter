Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a more sustained and potent, yet potentially more controlled, cytokine release profile compared to those manufactured without it. This is due to IL-15's ability to foster a less differentiated, more persistent T cell phenotype with reduced exhaustion, leading to a durable and effective anti-tumor response with a potentially lower risk of severe cytokine-related toxicities.
