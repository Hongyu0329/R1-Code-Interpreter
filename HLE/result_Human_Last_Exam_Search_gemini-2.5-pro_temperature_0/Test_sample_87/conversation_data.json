    "To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we will use the properties and identities of mutual information.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Given Information\nWe are given the following values for the random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that the random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$, which implies that if you know the value of $Z$, you know the value of $W$. In information-theoretic terms, this means that the conditional entropy $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n### 2. Utilize the Chain Rule for Mutual Information\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$. We can apply this to our variables to find other necessary quantities.\n\nLet's consider the mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nWe can also express this using a different expansion of the chain rule:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\nUsing our calculated value for $I(X;Y,Z)$ and the given value for $I(X;Y|Z)$:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nThis allows us to determine $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n### 3. Relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to Known Quantities\nOur goal is to find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$. We can relate this to the given quantities using information identities. A key identity is:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W)$\n\nLet's verify this identity using the chain rule:\n*   $I(X,Y;W) = I(Y;W) + I(X;W|Y)$\n*   $I(X,Y;W) = I(X;W) + I(Y;W|X)$\n\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$I(Y;W) + I(X;W|Y) = I(X;W) + I(Y;W|X)$\nRearranging this gives:\n$I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W)$\n\nNow, starting from the chain rule $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$, we can write:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,W) - I(X;W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\nUsing the identity we just derived, we can substitute for the difference term:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W)$\n\nSubstituting the given value $I(X;Y) = 3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W)$\n\n### 4. Maximize the Expression\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $3 + I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W)$. This involves maximizing $I(Y;W|X)$ and minimizing $I(Y;W)$.\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, the Data Processing Inequality applies. This inequality states that for a Markov chain $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$, we have $I(A;C) \\le I(A;B)$ and $I(A;C) \\le I(B;C)$. Because $W=f(Z)$, we have the Markov chains $Y \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$ and $(Y,X) \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$.\n\nThis leads to the following inequalities:\n1.  $I(Y;W) \\ge 0$, as mutual information is always non-negative.\n2.  $I(Y;W|X) \\le I(Y;Z|X)$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the expression is bounded by:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + I(Y;Z|X) - 0 = 3 + I(Y;Z|X)$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Bound\nWe need to find the value of $I(Y;Z|X)$. We can use the chain rule on $I(X,Y;Z)$:\n$I(X,Y;Z) = I(X;Z) + I(Y;Z|X)$\n\nWe already found that $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$. By symmetry of mutual information, $I(X,Y;Z) = I(Z;X,Y) = 8$. We also calculated $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the chain rule expression:\n$8 = 6 + I(Y;Z|X)$\n$I(Y;Z|X) = 2$\n\nNow, we can find the maximum value for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + I(Y;Z|X) = 3 + 2 = 5$\n\nThe largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 5. This maximum is achieved if a function $W=f(Z)$ can be chosen such that $I(Y;W|X)$ reaches its maximum possible value of 2, and $I(Y;W)$ reaches its minimum possible value of 0. The existence of such a distribution is possible in principle, as no contradictions arise from these conditions.\n\n<<<5>>>"
