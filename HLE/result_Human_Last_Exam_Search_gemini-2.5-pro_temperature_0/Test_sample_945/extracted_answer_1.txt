The critical speed \( v_{\text{crit}} \) for an oversteering vehicle, at which its linear lateral dynamics become unstable, is derived from the stability conditions of the linear single-track model.

The equations of motion for the single-track model can be represented in state-space form, leading to a second-order characteristic equation `s^2 + A_1 s + A_0 = 0`. For the system to be stable, the Routh-Hurwitz criterion requires that all coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are positive, meaning `A_1 > 0` and `A_0 > 0`.

The coefficient `A_1` represents the system's damping and is always positive for a vehicle with physically meaningful parameters. The stability is therefore determined by the sign of the constant term `A_0`, which is given by:

`A_0 = (c_f c_r (a+b)^2) / (m I v^2) - (a c_f - b c_r) / I`

A vehicle is defined as **oversteering** when the understeer gradient is negative, which corresponds to the condition:

`a c_f - b c_r > 0`

For an oversteering vehicle, the second term in the expression for `A_0` is negative. This means that as the vehicle's speed `v` increases, `A_0` decreases and can become zero or negative. The point at which `A_0 = 0` defines the threshold of instability. The speed at this threshold is the critical speed, `v_{\text{crit}}`.

Setting `A_0 = 0` and solving for `v`:

`(c_f c_r (a+b)^2) / (m I v_{\text{crit}}^2) = (a c_f - b c_r) / I`

Rearranging the terms to solve for `v_{\text{crit}}^2`:

`v_{\text{crit}}^2 = (c_f c_r (a+b)^2) / (m (a c_f - b c_r))`

Taking the square root yields the critical speed:

`v_{\text{crit}} = sqrt( (c_f c_r (a+b)^2) / (m (a c_f - b c_r)) )`

Above this speed, the vehicle's linear lateral dynamics become divergently unstable. For understeering or neutral steering vehicles (`a c_f - b c_r \le 0`), the term `A_0` is always positive, and thus, within the limits of this linear model, they do not have a critical speed and are stable at all velocities.
