    "The minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, is 2.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following reasoning:\n\n1.  **Lower Bound for the Area**:\n    The set of lines `px + qy = 1` with `p` and `q` as coprime integers includes the four lines `x = 1` (for `p=1, q=0`), `x = -1` (for `p=-1, q=0`), `y = 1` (for `p=0, q=1`), and `y = -1` (for `p=0, q=-1`). Any convex set that intersects these four lines must contain a convex quadrilateral with one vertex on each of these lines. These four lines form a square with vertices at `(±1, ±1)`, which has an area of 4. A known result in geometry states that the minimum area of a convex set that intersects all four sides of a rectangle is half the area of the rectangle. Therefore, the minimal area of our convex domain must be at least `4 / 2 = 2`.\n\n2.  **Upper Bound for the Area**:\n    We need to find a convex domain that satisfies the condition and has an area of 2. Consider the diamond-shaped region defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`. This is a convex set with vertices at `(1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(-1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)`. The area of this diamond is 2.\n\n3.  **Verification of the Diamond Shape**:\n    A line intersects a convex set if the value `1` is within the range of the set's support function evaluated at the line's normal vector. For the line `px + qy = 1`, the normal vector is `(p, q)`. The support function of the diamond `|x| + |y| ≤ 1` is `h(p, q) = max(|p|, |q|)`. For the line to intersect the diamond, the condition `h(p, q) ≥ 1` must be met.\n\n    For any pair of coprime integers `p` and `q`:\n    *   If one of `p` or `q` is zero, the other must be `±1` for them to be coprime. In this case, `max(|p|, |q|) = 1`.\n    *   If both `p` and `q` are non-zero, then `|p| ≥ 1` and `|q| ≥ 1`, which means `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n\n    Since the condition holds for all pairs of coprime integers, the diamond with an area of 2 intersects all the specified lines.\n\nBecause the minimal area is at least 2, and a shape with an area of 2 that satisfies the conditions has been found, the minimal area is exactly 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
