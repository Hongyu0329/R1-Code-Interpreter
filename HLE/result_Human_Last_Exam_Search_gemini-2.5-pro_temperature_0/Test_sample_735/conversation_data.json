    "A finite group is said to contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 if there exists a subset of three elements, let's call it S, such that no product of two elements in S (including an element with itself) is also in S, and this set cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without violating this property. The classification of such finite groups is a solved problem in group theory, with the definitive work being done by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart. Their research proves that any finite group containing such a set must have an order of 24 or less.\n\nBased on their complete classification, there are precisely 14 isomorphism classes of finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3. These groups are:\n\n**Abelian Groups:**\n*   **C₆:** The cyclic group of order 6.\n*   **C₈:** The cyclic group of order 8.\n*   **C₉:** The cyclic group of order 9.\n*   **C₁₀:** The cyclic group of order 10.\n*   **C₁₂:** The cyclic group of order 12.\n*   **C₁₄:** The cyclic group of order 14.\n*   **C₁₅:** The cyclic group of order 15.\n*   **C₁₆:** The cyclic group of order 16.\n\n**Non-Abelian Groups:**\n*   **D₈:** The dihedral group of order 8.\n*   **Q₈:** The quaternion group of order 8.\n*   **D₁₀:** The dihedral group of order 10.\n*   **A₄:** The alternating group on four letters, of order 12.\n*   **Q₁₂:** The dicyclic group of order 12.\n*   **SL(2,3):** The special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field of 3 elements, of order 24. This group is also isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group.\n\nTherefore, the total number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3 is 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
