    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\nThe number of subgroups of a given index in a group is determined by the number of its homomorphisms onto groups of that order. For an index of 4, we consider homomorphisms to the cyclic group of order 4, denoted Z/4Z, and the Klein four-group, V₄ (isomorphic to Z/2Z × Z/2Z).\n\nThe Grigorchuk group, denoted as G, is a 2-group, which means that every element in the group has an order that is a power of two. Consequently, any homomorphism from G to Z/4Z can only map elements to the subgroup of order 2 in Z/4Z or the trivial subgroup. This means there are no surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to Z/4Z, and thus no normal subgroups with a cyclic quotient of order 4.\n\nWe therefore only need to consider homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to the Klein four-group, V₄. The number of such homomorphisms is determined by the abelianization of G, which is the quotient group G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be isomorphic to the direct product of three copies of the cyclic group of order 2, (Z/2Z)³.\n\nA homomorphism from (Z/2Z)³ to V₄ is determined by where the three generators of (Z/2Z)³ are sent. Since each of the three generators can be mapped to any of the four elements of V₄, there are 4³ = 64 possible homomorphisms.\n\nSubgroups of index 4 correspond to the kernels of *surjective* homomorphisms. We must therefore subtract the non-surjective homomorphisms from the total of 64. A homomorphism is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of V₄. The proper subgroups of V₄ are the trivial group and three distinct subgroups of order 2.\n\n*   **Trivial Image:** There is only one homomorphism that maps every element to the identity.\n*   **Image of Order 2:** There are three subgroups of order 2 in V₄. For each of these, the number of homomorphisms from (Z/2Z)³ to it is 2³ = 8. Excluding the trivial homomorphism (which has already been counted), there are 7 non-trivial homomorphisms to each subgroup of order 2. This gives a total of 3 * 7 = 21 homomorphisms whose image is a subgroup of order 2.\n\nThe total number of non-surjective homomorphisms is 1 + 21 = 22. Therefore, the number of surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to V₄ is 64 - 22 = 42.\n\nEach of these 42 surjective homomorphisms has a kernel that is a normal subgroup of index 4. Multiple homomorphisms can share the same kernel. The number of distinct surjective homomorphisms with the same kernel is equal to the order of the automorphism group of the codomain, in this case, Aut(V₄). The automorphism group of the Klein four-group is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃, which has an order of 6.\n\nThus, the 42 surjective homomorphisms can be partitioned into sets of 6, with each set corresponding to a single normal subgroup of index 4. The number of such subgroups is therefore 42 / 6 = 7.\n\nSince the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group, all of its subgroups of index 4 are normal.\n\n<<<7>>>"
