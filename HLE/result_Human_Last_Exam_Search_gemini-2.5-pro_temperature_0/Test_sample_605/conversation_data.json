    "An analysis of the provided equation and weights reveals that the polynomial is not quasi-homogeneous as given. For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a weighted projective space, the weighted degree of each monomial term in its defining equation must be the same. The sum of the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) is 225, which should be the degree of the polynomial.\n\nCalculating the weighted degree for each term of the polynomial $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$:\n*   $z_1^8z_3 \\implies 8 \\cdot 22 + 49 = 225$\n*   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3 \\implies 4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 49 = 224$\n*   $z_1z_2^7 \\implies 1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 225$\n*   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 \\implies 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$\n*   $z_2z_3^4 \\implies 29 + 4 \\cdot 49 = 225$\n*   $z_4^3z_5 \\implies 3 \\cdot 50 + 75 = 225$\n*   $z_5^3 \\implies 3 \\cdot 75 = 225$\n\nThe second term has a degree of 224, while the others have a degree of 225. This indicates a likely typographical error in the polynomial provided.\n\nHowever, the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link is determined by the weights of the ambient projective space. Research on Calabi-Yau links has led to the creation of databases where topological invariants are computed for thousands of possible weight systems.\n\nFor the Calabi-Yau link defined as a hypersurface in the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$, the Crawley-Nordström (CN) invariant has been calculated. A 2024 paper on machine learning and Sasakian topology explicitly lists the invariant for this specific set of weights.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau Link represented in the ambient space formed by the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) is 35. This is a $\\mathbb{Z}_{48}$-valued invariant, and for Calabi-Yau links, it is always an odd integer.\n\n<<<35>>>"
