The situations that will result in a stronger magnetic field at the other end of the cylinder are, in order of decreasing strength:
1. The cylinder consists of a ferromagnetic core surrounded by an ideal superconducting shell.
2. The cylinder is made of a ferromagnetic material with a high linear permeability.
3. The cylinder is a hollow tube (air in the core) made of an ideal superconducting material.
4. The cylinder consists of an ideal superconducting core surrounded by a ferromagnetic shell.
