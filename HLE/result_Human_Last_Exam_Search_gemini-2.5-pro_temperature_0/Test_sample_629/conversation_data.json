    "The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot is 5. A grid diagram of this size is a 5x5 grid. For a grid number of 5, there are a total of 10 distinct diagrams that represent a trefoil knot, including both the left-handed and right-handed versions.\n\nThe left-handed trefoil is a type of knot known as a (p, 2)-torus knot, specifically the (3,2)-torus knot. For these types of knots, it has been shown that any minimal grid diagram is a \"standard diagram\". Furthermore, for similar knots, all minimal grid diagrams can be generated from a single standard one through cyclic permutations of the grid's rows and columns. These cyclic permutations are equivalent to translations.\n\nThis implies that while there may be multiple ways to draw the markings on a 5x5 grid to produce a left-handed trefoil, all of these diagrams are equivalent to each other under the operations of translation (cyclic permutation) and rotation. Therefore, there is only one unique minimal grid diagram for the left-hand trefoil knot up to these equivalences.\n\n<<<A>>>"
