    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must first identify the syllables, apply elisions, and then determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable to group them into six metrical feet. A dactyl consists of one long syllable followed by two short syllables (– ◡ ◡), while a spondee consists of two long syllables (– –).\n\nThe line is: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago`\n\n1.  **Elisions:**\n    *   The final `-um` of `verum` elides with the initial `u-` of `ubi`.\n    *   The final `-e` of `atque` elides with the initial `h-` of `hominis` (the 'h' is ignored in scansion).\n\n2.  **Syllabification and Quantity Analysis:**\n    *   **Foot 1:** `ver(um) ubi` becomes `vē-rŭ-bĭ`. The first syllable of a hexameter is always long. The `u` and `i` in `ubi` are naturally short. This forms a **dactyl (D)**.\n    *   **Foot 2:** `equi`. The `e` in `equi` is naturally short, but for the meter to work, it must be treated as long (a poetic license known as systole). The `i` is long. This forms a **spondee (S)**: `ē-quī`.\n    *   **Foot 3:** `atqu(e) hominis` is scanned as `āt-qu'hŏ-mĭ-`. The `at-` is long by position (followed by two consonants, `q` and `h`). The `o` and `i` in `hominis` are short. This forms a **dactyl (D)**.\n    *   **Foot 4:** The remaining syllable from `hominis` (`-nis`, which is long) combines with `casu` (`cā-sū`, both syllables are long). This forms a **spondee (S)**: `nīs cā-sū`.\n    *   **Foot 5:** `convenit` is scanned as `cōn-vĕ-nĭt`. The first syllable is long by position. The `e` and `i` are short. This forms a **dactyl (D)**.\n    *   **Foot 6:** `imago` is scanned as `ĭ-mā-gō`. The final syllable is always treated as long in the sixth foot. This forms a **spondee (S)**.\n\nTherefore, the scansion of the line is Dactyl, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee.\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
