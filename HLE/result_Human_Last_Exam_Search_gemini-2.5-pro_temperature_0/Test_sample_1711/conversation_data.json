    "The smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$ is 1.\n\nHere is the reasoning for this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Condition:** The problem requires finding the smallest set $A$ that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of $G$. A cyclic subgroup is any subgroup generated by a single element $g \\in G$, denoted as $\\langle g \\rangle$. The condition is that for every $g \\in G$, the intersection $\\langle g \\rangle \\cap A$ must not be the empty set.\n\n2.  **Identifying a Universal Element:** Let $0_G$ be the identity element of the group $G$. By the definition of a subgroup, every subgroup of $G$ must contain the identity element. Therefore, for any element $g \\in G$, the identity element $0_G$ is always an element of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Constructing the Set A:** Consider the set $A$ containing only the identity element: $A = \\{0_G\\}$.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Condition:** Let's check if this set $A$ satisfies the condition for any cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$:\n    *   The intersection of $\\langle g \\rangle$ and $A$ is $\\langle g \\rangle \\cap \\{0_G\\}$.\n    *   Since $0_G$ is in every $\\langle g \\rangle$, the intersection is $\\{0_G\\}$.\n    *   The set $\\{0_G\\}$ is not the empty set.\n    *   Therefore, the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ satisfies the condition that it intersects every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\n5.  **Determining the Smallest Size:** The size of the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ is 1. A set of size 0 would be the empty set, $\\emptyset$. The intersection of the empty set with any subgroup is empty, so a set of size 0 would not satisfy the condition. Thus, the minimum possible size is 1.\n\nThe complex structure of the group $G=(\\Bbb{Z}/49\\Bbb{Z})^{2024}$ is not relevant to the solution, as the existence of a common identity element in all subgroups is a fundamental property of any group.\n\n<<<1>>>"
