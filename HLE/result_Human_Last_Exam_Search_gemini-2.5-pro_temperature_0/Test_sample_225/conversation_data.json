    "The curve described by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t) is a Lissajous curve. The number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve is determined by the frequencies of the sinusoidal functions, which in this case are a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are relatively prime odd integers, the number of self-intersection points can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nIn this specific case, a = 9 and b = 5. Both are odd numbers, and their greatest common divisor is 1, so they are relatively prime. Applying the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThe use of cosine for the x-component and sine for the y-component introduces a phase shift of Ï€/2, but this does not change the number of self-intersection points for a generic Lissajous curve. The formula for the number of self-intersections when both frequencies are odd is (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
