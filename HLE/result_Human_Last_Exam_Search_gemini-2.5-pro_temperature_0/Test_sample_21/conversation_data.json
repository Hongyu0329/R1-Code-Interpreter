    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of its Galois group, a concept explained by the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This density is the proportion of elements in the Galois group that act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. For the given polynomial, $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$, the first step is to identify its Galois group over the rational numbers.\n\nThe polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers, which can be shown using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The Galois group of this polynomial is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. While initial analysis might suggest various groups, a detailed examination of the polynomial's factorization modulo different primes reveals the specific structure of its Galois group.\n\nThe Galois group for this particular polynomial is the Frobenius group $F_{42}$ (also denoted as $C_7 \\rtimes C_6$). This group has an order of 42. It can be represented as the group of affine transformations on the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, that is, maps of the form $x \\mapsto ax+b$ where $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^\\times$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is equal to the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the total order of the group. An element in the Galois group is a 7-cycle if and only if it has order 7.\n\nIn the group $F_{42}$, the elements that are 7-cycles correspond to the translations $x \\mapsto x+b$ where $b \\neq 0$. There are 6 such non-zero elements for $b$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$. The total number of elements in the group is 42.\n\nTherefore, the natural density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / (Order of the group) = 6 / 42 = 1/7.\n\n<<<1/7>>>"
