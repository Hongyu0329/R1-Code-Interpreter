    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The solution to this equation, and specifically the conditions under which no solution exists, can be determined by analyzing its structure.\n\n### Analysis of the Integral Equation\n\nThe equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n\nThe kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be expressed as a finite sum, which makes it a degenerate (or separable) kernel. The sum is a geometric series:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}`\n\nSubstituting this into the equation gives:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-k} u(y) dy`\n\nThis shows that `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1` plus the constant 1. The integrals in the sum are constants. Let `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-k} u(y) dy`. Then:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^k`\n\n### Conversion to a Linear Algebra Problem\n\nThis problem can be converted into a system of linear algebraic equations. By substituting the polynomial form of `u(x)` back into the definitions of the constants `c_k`, we can derive an eigenvalue problem. An equivalent approach is to analyze the homogeneous version of the equation, which defines the characteristic values of `λ`.\n\nThe homogeneous equation `v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) v(y) dy` has non-trivial solutions `v(x)` only for specific values of `λ`. These solutions, `v(x)`, must be polynomials of degree at most `n-1`. Let `v(x) = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j`. Substituting this into the homogeneous equation leads to the matrix eigenvalue problem:\n`μa = Ba`\nwhere `μ = 1/λ`, `a` is the column vector of coefficients `[a₀, a₁, ..., a_{n-1}]ᵀ`, and `B` is an `n x n` matrix with elements:\n`B_{kj} = 1 / (n - k + j)` for `k, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\n### Condition for No Solution\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, if `λ` is a characteristic value (meaning `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the integral operator), the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the function `f(x)` is orthogonal to all the eigenfunctions `v(x)` corresponding to that `λ`. In this problem, `f(x) = 1`.\n\nThe orthogonality condition is:\n`∫₀¹ f(x)v(x) dx = ∫₀¹ 1 * v(x) dx = 0`\n\nIt can be shown that for any non-trivial eigenfunction `v(x)` of this specific integral operator, the integral `∫₀¹ v(x) dx` is never zero. This means the orthogonality condition is never satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the original equation has **no solution** precisely when `λ` is a characteristic value of the homogeneous equation.\n\n### The Values of λ\n\nThe characteristic values `λ` are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues `μ` of the matrix `B`. The matrix `B` is a variant of a Cauchy matrix. While the eigenvalues of general Cauchy matrices do not have a simple closed-form expression, they are well-defined for any given integer `n ≥ 1`.\n\nFor specific values of `n`, these eigenvalues can be calculated:\n*   For `n=1`, the kernel is `K(x,y) = 1`. The matrix `B` is `[1]`, so its eigenvalue is `μ=1`. This gives `λ = 1/1 = 1`.\n*   For `n=2`, the kernel is `K(x,y) = x+y`. The matrix `B` is `[[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`. The eigenvalues are `μ = (3 ± 2√3) / 6`. The corresponding values for `λ` are `λ = 1/μ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nFor a general integer `n`, the equation has no solution for values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `B` defined by `B_{kj} = 1/(n-k+j)` for `k,j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`. There are `n` such distinct real values of `λ` for each `n`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix B, where the elements of B are given by B_kj = 1/(n-k+j) for k,j = 0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
