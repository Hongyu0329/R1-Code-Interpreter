    "The reaction described is a classic example of a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\n\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two functional groups on a benzene ring that can direct the lithiation: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt2) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe2). Both are known as directing metalation groups (DMGs).\n\n**Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation**\n\nThe first step involves the reaction with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi), a strong base, in the presence of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent. The purpose of this step is to deprotonate the aromatic ring at a specific position.\n\n*   **Role of Directing Groups:** The regioselectivity of the deprotonation is controlled by the directing groups. The heteroatom (oxygen in the amide, nitrogen in the amine) coordinates to the lithium ion of the sec-BuLi, bringing the base close to the protons on the adjacent (ortho) carbon atoms.\n*   **Hierarchy of Directing Groups:** The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is at position 1, and the dimethylamino group is at position 3.\n    *   The amide group directs lithiation to the ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n    *   The amino group directs lithiation to its ortho positions: C2 and C4.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** When multiple directing groups are present, the lithiation occurs ortho to the stronger directing group. The tertiary amide group is a more powerful directing group than the tertiary amine group. Furthermore, both groups cooperatively direct the lithiation to the C2 position. Therefore, the deprotonation will occur selectively at the C2 position, forming an aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n\nThe newly formed aryllithium species at C2 is a potent nucleophile. It is then treated with methyl iodide (CH3I). The carbanionic carbon at C2 attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction, displacing the iodide ion.\n\nThis results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, with a methyl group being introduced at the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\n**Product**\n\nThe final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
