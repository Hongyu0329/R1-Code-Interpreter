    "Here is a systematic breakdown of all possible true boolean expressions that can be written with exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\nThe precedence of operators is `!` > `&` > `|`, and `&` and `|` are left-associative. An expression is considered valid if it is syntactically correct according to standard boolean algebra rules.\n\nThe valid expressions can be categorized into the following distinct structures:\n\n### 1. Three-Operand Expressions (`A op B op C`)\nThese expressions have three operands and two operators. Due to operator precedence and associativity, parentheses are not required.\n*   **`A & B & C`**: Only one combination is true:\n    *   `T&T&T`\n*   **`A | B | C`**: Seven combinations are true (all except `F|F|F`):\n    *   `T|T|T`, `T|T|F`, `T|F|T`, `T|F|F`, `F|T|T`, `F|T|F`, `F|F|T`\n*   **`A | B & C`** (parsed as `A | (B & C)`): Five combinations are true:\n    *   `T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, `F|T&T`\n*   **`A & B | C`** (parsed as `(A & B) | C`): Five combinations are true:\n    *   `T&T|T`, `T&T|F`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T`\n\nThis category contains a total of **18** expressions.\n\n### 2. Parenthesized Two-Operand Expressions (`(A op B)`)\nThese expressions consist of two operands and one operator, enclosed in parentheses.\n*   **`(A & B)`**: One combination is true:\n    *   `(T&T)`\n*   **`(A | B)`**: Three combinations are true:\n    *   `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`\n\nThis category contains a total of **4** expressions.\n\n### 3. Negated Operand Expressions\nThese are two-operand expressions where one or both operands are negated.\n*   **`!A & !B`**: One combination is true:\n    *   `!F&!F`\n*   **`!A | !B`**: Three combinations are true:\n    *   `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`\n*   **`!!A & B`** (equivalent to `A & B`): One combination is true:\n    *   `!!T&T`\n*   **`!!A | B`** (equivalent to `A | B`): Three combinations are true:\n    *   `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`\n*   **`A & !!B`** (equivalent to `A & B`): One combination is true:\n    *   `T&!!T`\n*   **`A | !!B`** (equivalent to `A | B`): Three combinations are true:\n    *   `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`\n\nThis category contains a total of **16** expressions (1+3+1+3+1+3).\n\n### 4. Expressions with Parenthesized Operands\nThese are two-operand expressions where one of the operands is a parenthesized literal.\n*   **`A & (B)`** and **`(A) & B`**: Two combinations are true:\n    *   `T&(T)`, `(T)&T`\n*   **`A | (B)`** and **`(A) | B`**: Six combinations are true:\n    *   `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`\n    *   `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`\n\nThis category contains a total of **8** expressions.\n\n### 5. Unary and Heavily Parenthesized Expressions\nThese expressions involve multiple negations or nested parentheses.\n*   `!!!!T`\n*   `((T))`\n*   `!!(T)`\n*   `(!!T)`\n*   `!(!T)`\n*   `(!(!T))`\n*   `(!(F))`\n\nThis category contains a total of **7** expressions.\n\nSumming up the counts from all categories:\n18 (Category 1) + 4 (Category 2) + 16 (Category 3) + 8 (Category 4) + 7 (Category 5) = 53\n\n<<<53>>>"
