    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, two molecules of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ are released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n*   **Starting Molecule:** The glucose is labeled with a carbon-13 isotope at positions 1 and 4.\n*   **Glycolysis:** This initial stage of cellular respiration breaks down the 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. Glycolysis itself does not produce any carbon dioxide.\n*   **Tracing the Labeled Carbons:**\n    *   During glycolysis, the 6-carbon glucose is split into two 3-carbon molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C from position 1 of glucose ends up at the carboxyl group (C1 position) of one of the pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C from position 4 of glucose ends up at the carboxyl group (C1 position) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation:** Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA. In this step, a carboxyl group is removed from each pyruvate, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide.\n*   **Release of Labeled CO₂:** Since both pyruvate molecules are labeled at their carboxyl carbon (C1), the carbon atom that is removed to form CO₂, both molecules of CO₂ produced will be ¹³C-labeled.\n\nTherefore, for every one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, the process yields two molecules of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide.\n\n<<<2>>>"
