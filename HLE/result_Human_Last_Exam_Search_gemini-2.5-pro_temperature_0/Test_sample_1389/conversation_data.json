    "An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is a type of vaccine that provides complete protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while providing no protection to the rest. For example, a vaccine with 80% efficacy in an all-or-nothing model would make 80% of recipients perfectly immune, while the remaining 20% would be just as susceptible to infection as unvaccinated individuals. This is distinct from a \"leaky\" vaccine, which reduces the per-exposure risk of infection for all vaccinated individuals by a certain percentage, but doesn't provide perfect immunity to anyone.\n\nIn vaccine trials, efficacy is commonly calculated as 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (IRR), where the IRR is the incidence rate in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n\nFor an all-or-nothing vaccine, let's consider the mechanism:\n*   A proportion of the vaccinated group, equal to the true efficacy (let's call it VE_S), is completely protected and will never get infected. Their incidence rate is 0.\n*   The remaining proportion (1 - VE_S) is not protected at all. Their risk of infection is the same as that of the unvaccinated group.\n\nThe overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group (IR_v) is therefore driven entirely by the non-protected subgroup. This means the incidence rate in the vaccinated group is the rate of the unvaccinated group (IR_u) multiplied by the proportion of vaccinated people who are not protected:\n\n`IR_v = IR_u * (1 - VE_S)`\n\nThe incidence rate ratio (IRR) is `IR_v / IR_u`. Substituting the expression above:\n\n`IRR = (IR_u * (1 - VE_S)) / IR_u`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n`IRR = 1 - VE_S`\n\nThe standard calculation for vaccine efficacy (VE) is `1 - IRR`. If we substitute our result for the IRR in an all-or-nothing model:\n\n`VE = 1 - (1 - VE_S)`\n`VE = VE_S`\n\nThis shows that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the standard formula `1 - IRR` correctly measures the proportion of individuals who are completely protected. In this model, the \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" is effectively the proportion of people who are rendered fully immune (VE_S), as there is no partial reduction in risk per exposure for any given individual. Therefore, the 1-incidence rate ratio correctly estimates this value.\n\n<<<C>>>"
