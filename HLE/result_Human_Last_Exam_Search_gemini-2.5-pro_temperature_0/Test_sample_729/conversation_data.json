    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, is a non-abelian group with a specific structure. To find the number of its power subgroups, we must first understand the group's presentation and the nature of its elements.\n\n### Structure of the Generalized Quaternion Group Q128\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 2<sup>n</sup> (where n ≥ 3) can be defined by the presentation:\nQ<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub> = ⟨x, y | x<sup>2<sup>n-1</sup></sup> = 1, x<sup>2<sup>n-2</sup></sup> = y<sup>2</sup>, yxy<sup>-1</sup> = x<sup>-1</sup>⟩\n\nFor Q128, we have 2<sup>n</sup> = 128, which means n = 7. Therefore, the presentation for Q128 is:\nQ<sub>128</sub> = ⟨x, y | x<sup>64</sup> = 1, x<sup>32</sup> = y<sup>2</sup>, yxy<sup>-1</sup> = x<sup>-1</sup>⟩\n\nThe elements of Q128 consist of two types:\n1.  Powers of x: {x<sup>i</sup> | 0 ≤ i < 64}. These elements form a cyclic subgroup ⟨x⟩ of order 64.\n2.  Elements of the form x<sup>i</sup>y: {x<sup>i</sup>y | 0 ≤ i < 64}. There are 64 such elements.\n\nAn important property of the elements of the form x<sup>i</sup>y is that their square is always x<sup>32</sup>, and their order is 4:\n(x<sup>i</sup>y)<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>i</sup>yx<sup>i</sup>y = x<sup>i</sup>(yx<sup>i</sup>y<sup>-1</sup>)y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>i</sup>(x<sup>-i</sup>)y<sup>2</sup> = y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>32</sup>\n(x<sup>i</sup>y)<sup>4</sup> = (x<sup>32</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>64</sup> = 1\n\n### Determining the Power Subgroups\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be expressed as H = G<sup>k</sup> = {g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G} for some integer k. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way for G = Q128.\n\nWe analyze the resulting subgroup G<sup>k</sup> based on the parity of the integer k.\n\n**Case 1: k is an odd integer**\n\nIf k is odd, we examine the k-th powers of all elements in Q128.\n*   For elements in the cyclic subgroup ⟨x⟩, the k-th power is (x<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = x<sup>ik</sup>. Since k is odd, it is coprime to the order of x (64). Thus, the set of all k-th powers of elements in ⟨x⟩ is ⟨x⟩ itself.\n*   For elements of the form x<sup>i</sup>y, the k-th power is (x<sup>i</sup>y)<sup>k</sup>. Since k is odd, we can write k = 2m + 1 for some integer m.\n    (x<sup>i</sup>y)<sup>k</sup> = (x<sup>i</sup>y)<sup>2m+1</sup> = ((x<sup>i</sup>y)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>m</sup>(x<sup>i</sup>y) = (x<sup>32</sup>)<sup>m</sup>(x<sup>i</sup>y) = x<sup>32m+i</sup>y.\n    As i ranges from 0 to 63, the expression 32m+i also covers all residues modulo 64 (if m is even) or a shifted set of all residues (if m is odd). In either case, the set {x<sup>32m+i</sup>y | 0 ≤ i < 64} is the same as the set of all elements not in ⟨x⟩.\n\nTherefore, for any odd integer k, the power subgroup G<sup>k</sup> is the entire group Q128. This gives us our first power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: k is an even integer**\n\nIf k is even, let k = 2<sup>j</sup>m, where m is an odd integer and j ≥ 1.\n*   For an element x<sup>i</sup> in ⟨x⟩, its k-th power is (x<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = x<sup>ik</sup> = x<sup>i * 2<sup>j</sup>m</sup>. The set of these elements forms the cyclic subgroup ⟨x<sup>2<sup>j</sup>m</sup>⟩. Since m is odd, this is the same as the subgroup ⟨x<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup>⟩.\n*   For an element x<sup>i</sup>y, its k-th power is (x<sup>i</sup>y)<sup>k</sup> = ((x<sup>i</sup>y)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>k/2</sup> = (x<sup>32</sup>)<sup>k/2</sup> = x<sup>16k</sup> = x<sup>16 * 2<sup>j</sup>m</sup> = x<sup>m * 2<sup>j+4</sup></sup>.\n\nThe resulting power subgroup G<sup>k</sup> is generated by ⟨x<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup>⟩ and x<sup>m * 2<sup>j+4</sup></sup>. Since j ≥ 1, we have j+4 > j, which means 2<sup>j</sup> divides 2<sup>j+4</sup>. Consequently, x<sup>m * 2<sup>j+4</sup></sup> is an element of ⟨x<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup>⟩. Thus, the power subgroup is simply ⟨x<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup>⟩.\n\nThe possible values for j correspond to the powers of 2 that can be factored from k. The order of x is 64 = 2<sup>6</sup>.\n*   If j = 1 (e.g., k=2, 6, 10,...), the power subgroup is ⟨x<sup>2</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 32.\n*   If j = 2 (e.g., k=4, 12, 20,...), the power subgroup is ⟨x<sup>4</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 16.\n*   If j = 3 (e.g., k=8, 24, 40,...), the power subgroup is ⟨x<sup>8</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 8.\n*   If j = 4 (e.g., k=16, 48,...), the power subgroup is ⟨x<sup>16</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 4.\n*   If j = 5 (e.g., k=32, 96,...), the power subgroup is ⟨x<sup>32</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 2.\n*   If j = 6 (e.g., k=64, 192,...), the power subgroup is ⟨x<sup>64</sup>⟩ = {1}, the trivial subgroup.\n\nIn summary, the distinct power subgroups of Q128 are:\n1.  Q128 (for any odd k)\n2.  ⟨x<sup>2</sup>⟩\n3.  ⟨x<sup>4</sup>⟩\n4.  ⟨x<sup>8</sup>⟩\n5.  ⟨x<sup>16</sup>⟩\n6.  ⟨x<sup>32</sup>⟩\n7.  {1} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we find there are a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
