    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$, up to conjugacy by the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, is given by the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, which is denoted as $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe reasoning for this is as follows:\n1.  The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n2.  A reductive group is called split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ if it contains a maximal torus that is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. For groups of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be split.\n3.  For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. In this case, the $F$-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of $W$.\n4.  Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes for the Weyl groups of exceptional Lie types was determined by R.W. Carter. In his fundamental paper, \"Conjugacy classes in the Weyl group\" (1972), he classified and enumerated these classes. For the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, the number of conjugacy classes is 112. This result is widely cited and used in the literature.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
