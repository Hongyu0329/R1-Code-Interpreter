    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), typically measured by the proportion of phenotypic variance it explains (R²), is theoretically capped by the SNP heritability (h²_snp) of the trait. SNP heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, usually common SNPs on a genotyping array.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the predictive power of a PGS is generally lower than SNP heritability:\n\n*   **Theoretical Limit:** SNP heritability is the theoretical maximum variance that can be explained by a linear combination of the given SNPs. A polygenic score is essentially a linear model that uses these SNPs for prediction.\n*   **Estimation Errors:** The effect sizes of SNPs used to build a PGS are estimated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These estimates always have some degree of error.\n*   **Sample Differences:** A PGS is developed in a \"base\" or \"training\" dataset and then tested in a separate \"target\" dataset. Differences in genetic ancestry, linkage disequilibrium patterns (how SNPs are inherited together), and environmental factors between these two samples will reduce the predictive accuracy of the PGS in the target sample.\n*   **Incomplete Information:** The GWAS used to create the PGS may not have sufficient statistical power to detect all relevant SNPs, especially those with very small effects. Therefore, the resulting PGS is built on incomplete information, capturing only a fraction of the total SNP heritability.\n\nIn an ideal scenario, if the SNP effect sizes were known exactly and the base and target populations were identical, the variance explained by the polygenic score could approach the SNP heritability. However, due to the practical limitations mentioned above, the predictive ability of current polygenic scores is almost always lower, and often substantially lower, than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\n\nWhile some studies have explored specific scenarios where out-of-sample prediction R² can technically exceed certain estimates of SNP heritability due to heterogeneity between cohorts, the fundamental principle is that the true variance attributable to the SNPs themselves sets the upper bound for prediction using those same SNPs.\n\n<<<True>>>"
