    "The initial search has provided some valuable insights. The intersection of two connected sets is not necessarily connected. In fact, it can have any number of components, even infinitely many. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence is a tool that relates the homology groups (including the 0th homology group, which corresponds to the number of connected components) of the union and intersection of two sets to the homology groups of the sets themselves. This seems like a promising avenue to explore.\n\nThe problem specifies that the sets are closed and their union is the unit square. The unit square is connected and has no \"holes\" (its first homology group is trivial). Let the two closed connected sets be A and B. Their union X = A U B is the unit square. We are interested in the number of connected components of A ∩ B.\n\nLet's denote the number of connected components of a space S by c(S). The 0th Betti number, b₀(S), is equal to c(S). The relevant part of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for homology is:\n\n... → H₁(X) → H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) → H₀(X) → 0\n\nHere:\n*   H₁(X) is the first homology group of the unit square. Since the square is simply connected, H₁(X) = 0.\n*   H₀(A ∩ B) is the 0th homology group of the intersection. Its rank is the number of connected components of A ∩ B, which is what we want to find. Let's call this number 'n'. So, the rank of H₀(A ∩ B) is n.\n*   H₀(A) and H₀(B) are the 0th homology groups of the sets A and B. Since A and B are connected, they each have one connected component. So, H₀(A) ≅ ℤ and H₀(B) ≅ ℤ. Thus, H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) ≅ ℤ ⊕ ℤ, which has rank 2.\n*   H₀(X) is the 0th homology group of the unit square. Since the square is connected, it has one connected component, so H₀(X) ≅ ℤ, which has rank 1.\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n\n0 → ℤⁿ → ℤ² → ℤ → 0\n\nFor this sequence to be exact, the image of each homomorphism must be the kernel of the next.\n\nLet the homomorphism from H₀(A ∩ B) to H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) be denoted by α, and the homomorphism from H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) to H₀(X) be denoted by β.\n\nThe exactness of the sequence implies:\n1.  α is injective (since the map before it is the zero map from H₁(X)).\n2.  The image of α is the kernel of β.\n3.  β is surjective (since the map after it is the zero map).\n\nFrom the ranks of the groups (which are vector spaces over ℝ if we use real coefficients, or free abelian groups over ℤ), we can use the rank-nullity theorem. The rank of the image of a homomorphism plus the rank of its kernel equals the rank of the domain.\n\nFor the map β: ℤ² → ℤ, the rank of the domain is 2 and the rank of the codomain (and its image, since it's surjective) is 1. So, the rank of the kernel of β is 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nSince the image of α is the kernel of β, the rank of the image of α is 1.\nBecause α is injective, the rank of its domain, H₀(A ∩ B), must be equal to the rank of its image. Therefore, the rank of H₀(A ∩ B) is 1.\n\nThis would imply that the intersection has only one connected component. However, this application of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence seems too simplistic and likely overlooks some subtleties. The issue might be with the assumption that the standard Mayer-Vietoris sequence for open sets applies directly to closed sets without modification, or with how the maps are defined for non-manifold spaces.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from a more intuitive, geometric perspective. Can we construct two closed, connected sets whose union is the square and whose intersection has multiple components?\n\nLet A be a closed set. Let B be the closure of the complement of A in the square, i.e., B = cl(S \\ A), where S is the unit square. If A is closed, S \\ A is open. B is closed. The union A U B is the entire square. If A is connected, is B necessarily connected? Not always.\n\nLet's try to construct an example.\nConsider a horizontal line segment C in the middle of the square. Let A be a \"thickened\" version of this line, a closed rectangle. Let B be the closure of the complement of A. B would consist of two disjoint rectangles, so it is not connected.\n\nWe need both A and B to be connected.\n\nLet's try to create an intersection with two components.\nImagine two \"islands\" in the intersection. Let these be two small disjoint closed disks, D₁ and D₂. The intersection A ∩ B will be D₁ U D₂.\nNow we need to build A and B such that they are both connected, their union is the square, and their intersection is precisely D₁ U D₂.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let A be a set that \"snakes\" around, and B fills in the rest.\nConsider the unit square x.\nLet A be the union of the left half of the square [0, 1/2] x and the top-right quarter [1/2, 1] x [1/2, 1]. This set is connected.\nLet B be the union of the right half of the square [1/2, 1] x and the bottom-left quarter [0, 1/2] x [0, 1/2]. This set is also connected.\nThe union A U B is the whole square.\nThe intersection A ∩ B is the union of the vertical line segment {1/2} x [1/2, 1] and the horizontal line segment [0, 1/2] x {1/2}. These two segments intersect at (1/2, 1/2), so their union is connected. This gives 1 component.\n\nLet's try to separate the intersection.\nLet A be the graph of y = sin(1/x) for x in (0, 1], along with the segment {0} x [-1, 1], all contained within the square. This is a classic example of a connected set. Let's call this the \"topologist's sine curve\". Let's adapt this to our square.\nLet S = x.\nLet C₁ be the graph of y = (1/2) + (1/4)sin(π/x) for x in (0, 1]. Let L₁ be the line segment {0} x [1/4, 3/4]. Let K₁ = C₁ U L₁. K₁ is a connected set.\nLet C₂ be the graph of x = (1/2) + (1/4)sin(π/y) for y in (0, 1]. Let L₂ be the line segment [1/4, 3/4] x {0}. Let K₂ = C₂ U L₂. K₂ is a connected set.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's search for examples of this specific problem.The search results confirm that the intersection of two connected sets can be disconnected. One example given is two \"banana-shaped\" areas in the plane intersecting at both ends. This suggests that we can indeed have multiple components in the intersection. The key is to construct the two closed connected sets, A and B, such that their union is the unit square.\n\nLet's try to construct an example with an arbitrary number of components. Let the unit square be S = x.\n\nLet's aim for 'n' components in the intersection.\nConsider 'n' small, disjoint closed disks D₁, D₂, ..., Dₙ in the interior of the square. Let the intersection A ∩ B be the union of these 'n' disks.\n\nNow, we need to define A and B.\nLet A be a set that contains all these disks. To make A connected, we need to connect these disks within A.\nLet B be a set that also contains all these disks. To make B connected, we need to connect these disks within B.\nAnd critically, A U B must be the entire square S.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's define A first, and then define B as the closure of the complement of A in the square.\nLet S be the unit square.\nLet's create a set A that is connected but \"porous\" in a way that its complement's closure is also connected.\n\nConsider a horizontal line y = 1/2. Let's remove a sequence of open intervals from this line.\nLet I_k = ((1/2 - 1/(2k)), (1/2 - 1/(2k+1))) for k = 1, 2, ... and J_k = ((1/2 + 1/(2k+1)), (1/2 + 1/(2k))) for k = 1, 2, ...\nLet P be the set of points on the line y=1/2 whose x-coordinates are in the union of all I_k and J_k. P is a set of open intervals.\nLet L be the line segment x {1/2}.\nLet A' = L \\ P. A' is a closed set resembling a Cantor set on the line y=1/2.\n\nThis seems overly complicated. Let's simplify.\n\nConsider a \"comb\" like structure.\nLet A be the union of the bottom edge of the square x {0} and a series of vertical lines.\nLet A = ( x {0}) U ({1/n} x for n=1, 2, ...) U ({0} x). This set is connected. It is not closed in the square (the point (0,1) is a limit point not in the set if we only take {1/n}). Let's make it closed.\nLet A be the union of the bottom edge x {0}, the left edge {0} x, and vertical segments {1/k} x for k = 1, 2, 3, ... and the top edge x {1}. This is getting messy.\n\nLet's go back to the \"banana\" idea.\nLet the square be S.\nLet A be the left half of the square plus a \"finger\" reaching to the right edge.\nA = ([0, 1/2] x) U ([1/2, 1] x [1/4, 3/4])\nThis is connected and closed.\nLet B be the right half of the square plus a \"finger\" reaching to the left edge.\nB = ([1/2, 1] x) U ([0, 1/2] x [0, 1/4]) U ([0, 1/2] x [3/4, 1])\nLet's check the union A U B.\nA U B = ([0, 1/2] x) U ([1/2, 1] x [1/4, 3/4]) U ([1/2, 1] x) U ([0, 1/2] x [0, 1/4]) U ([0, 1/2] x [3/4, 1])\n= ( x) = S. So the union is the square.\nBoth A and B are connected and closed.\nNow, what is the intersection A ∩ B?\nA ∩ B = (([0, 1/2] x) U ([1/2, 1] x [1/4, 3/4])) ∩ (([1/2, 1] x) U ([0, 1/2] x [0, 1/4]) U ([0, 1/2] x [3/4, 1]))\nThe first part of the intersection is ([0, 1/2] x) ∩ (([1/2, 1] x) U ([0, 1/2] x [0, 1/4]) U ([0, 1/2] x [3/4, 1])).\nThis is ({1/2} x) U ([0, 1/2] x [0, 1/4]) U ([0, 1/2] x [3/4, 1]).\nThe second part of the intersection is ([1/2, 1] x [1/4, 3/4]) ∩ (([1/2, 1] x) U ([0, 1/2] x [0, 1/4]) U ([0, 1/2] x [3/4, 1])).\nThis is ([1/2, 1] x [1/4, 3/4]).\nSo, A ∩ B = ({1/2} x) U ([0, 1/2] x [0, 1/4]) U ([0, 1/2] x [3/4, 1]) U ([1/2, 1] x [1/4, 3/4]).\nLet's analyze the connectedness of this intersection.\nThe set includes the line x=1/2 from y=0 to y=1.\nThe set also includes the rectangle [0, 1/2] x [0, 1/4], which connects to the line at (1/2, y) for y in [0, 1/4].\nThe set also includes the rectangle [0, 1/2] x [3/4, 1], which connects to the line at (1/2, y) for y in [3/4, 1].\nThe set also includes the rectangle [1/2, 1] x [1/4, 3/4], which connects to the line at (1/2, y) for y in [1/4, 3/4].\nThe entire intersection is connected.\n\nLet's try to make the intersection disconnected.\nLet A be the union of the upper half of the square and a \"handle\" on the bottom.\nA = ( x [1/2, 1]) U ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/2]). A is closed and connected.\nLet B be the union of the lower half of the square and two \"handles\" on the top, which avoid the handle of A.\nB = ( x [0, 1/2]) U ([0, 1/4] x [1/2, 1]) U ([3/4, 1] x [1/2, 1]). B is closed and connected.\nLet's check the union A U B.\nA U B = ( x [1/2, 1]) U ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/2]) U ( x [0, 1/2]) U ([0, 1/4] x [1/2, 1]) U ([3/4, 1] x [1/2, 1])\n= ( x) = S. The union is the square.\nNow, what is the intersection A ∩ B?\nA ∩ B = (( x [1/2, 1]) U ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/2])) ∩ (( x [0, 1/2]) U ([0, 1/4] x [1/2, 1]) U ([3/4, 1] x [1/2, 1]))\nLet's compute the intersection term by term.\n1. ( x [1/2, 1]) ∩ ( x [0, 1/2]) = x {1/2} (the midline)\n2. ( x [1/2, 1]) ∩ (([0, 1/4] x [1/2, 1]) U ([3/4, 1] x [1/2, 1])) = ([0, 1/4] x [1/2, 1]) U ([3/4, 1] x [1/2, 1])\n3. ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/2]) ∩ ( x [0, 1/2]) = [1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/2]\n4. ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/2]) ∩ (([0, 1/4] x [1/2, 1]) U ([3/4, 1] x [1/2, 1])) = ∅\n\nSo, A ∩ B = ( x {1/2}) U ([0, 1/4] x [1/2, 1]) U ([3/4, 1] x [1/2, 1]) U ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/2]).\nLet's check the connectedness of this intersection.\nThe midline x {1/2} is part of it.\nThe set ([0, 1/4] x [1/2, 1]) connects to the midline at points [0, 1/4] x {1/2}.\nThe set ([3/4, 1] x [1/2, 1]) connects to the midline at points [3/4, 1] x {1/2}.\nThe set ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/2]) connects to the midline at points [1/4, 3/4] x {1/2}.\nThe whole intersection is connected.\n\nLet's reconsider the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. The issue might be that for closed sets, the sequence is not always exact, or the homology theory needs to be chosen carefully (e.g., Čech homology).\n\nLet's try a different construction.\nLet A be a set that looks like a spiral. Let B fill the rest.\nLet A be a closed spiral starting from the center and ending at the boundary of the square. A is connected.\nLet B be the closure of the complement of A. B is also connected.\nThe intersection A ∩ B is the boundary of A within the square. This is likely to be connected.\n\nLet's try to create two components in the intersection.\nLet the intersection be two points, for instance. Let A ∩ B = {(1/3, 1/2), (2/3, 1/2)}.\nLet A be a path that goes through these two points. For A to be closed and connected, it can be a simple curve.\nLet B be everything else in the square. B = cl(S \\ A).\nIf A is a simple curve, S \\ A is connected, so its closure B will be connected.\nSo we have A (a curve, connected), B (closure of complement, connected), A U B = S.\nThe intersection is A ∩ cl(S \\ A) = boundary of A in S. If A is just a curve, its boundary is its endpoints. If the curve's endpoints are on the boundary of the square, then the intersection is just the curve itself. This doesn't work.\n\nLet's go back to the idea of \"interlocking\" sets.\nLet's define A and B simultaneously.\nLet S be the unit square.\nLet C1 = {1/3} x [1/3, 2/3] and C2 = {2/3} x [1/3, 2/3]. These will be the two components of the intersection.\nLet A be a set containing C1 and C2 and a path connecting them.\nLet B be a set containing C1 and C2 and a different path connecting them.\n\nLet's try to build A and B from horizontal and vertical strips.\nLet A = ( x [0, 1/3]) U ( x [2/3, 1]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x).\nA is the union of the bottom third, the top third, and the middle vertical third. This set is connected and closed.\nLet B = ([0, 1/3] x) U ([2/3, 1] x).\nB is the union of the left third and the right third. This set is disconnected.\n\nLet's try again.\nLet A be the union of the left half and right half of the square, but with a gap in the middle.\nA = ([0, 1/3] x) U ([2/3, 1] x). This is disconnected. To connect them, add a bridge.\nA = ([0, 1/3] x) U ([2/3, 1] x) U ([1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1/3]). A is connected.\nLet B be the middle vertical strip, with bridges to cover the rest.\nB = ([1/3, 2/3] x) U ([0, 1/3] x [1/3, 1]) U ([2/3, 1] x [1/3, 1]). B is connected.\nLet's check the union.\nA U B = ([0, 1/3] x) U ([2/3, 1] x) U ([1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1/3]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x) U ([0, 1/3] x [1/3, 1]) U ([2/3, 1] x [1/3, 1])\n= ([0, 1/3] x) U ([2/3, 1] x) U ([1/3, 2/3] x) = x = S.\nThe union is the square.\nNow the intersection A ∩ B.\nA ∩ B = (([0, 1/3] x) U ([2/3, 1] x) U ([1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1/3])) ∩ (([1/3, 2/3] x) U ([0, 1/3] x [1/3, 1]) U ([2/3, 1] x [1/3, 1]))\nLet's break it down:\nTerm 1: ([0, 1/3] x) ∩ B = ({1/3} x [1/3, 1]) U ([0, 1/3] x [1/3, 1]) = [0, 1/3] x [1/3, 1]. No, this is wrong.\n([0, 1/3] x) ∩ (([1/3, 2/3] x) U ([0, 1/3] x [1/3, 1]) U ([2/3, 1] x [1/3, 1])) = ({1/3} x) U ([0, 1/3] x [1/3, 1]).\nTerm 2: ([2/3, 1] x) ∩ B = ({2/3} x) U ([2/3, 1] x [1/3, 1]).\nTerm 3: ([1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1/3]) ∩ B = ([1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1/3]).\nSo, A ∩ B = ({1/3} x) U ([0, 1/3] x [1/3, 1]) U ({2/3} x) U ([2/3, 1] x [1/3, 1]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1/3]).\nThis is connected.\n\nLet's consider a known result called the \"Lakes of Wada\" problem. It shows that it's possible to have three disjoint open sets in the plane that all have the same boundary. If we take two of these \"lakes\" and the \"land\" as our sets, their closures might work.\n\nLet's try to construct an example with infinitely many components.\nLet C be the Cantor set on the interval. Let A = C x. This is a closed set, but it is not connected. It has uncountably many components.\n\nLet's try to build the sets A and B by a limiting process.\nLet S be the unit square.\nLet's define a sequence of sets.\nLet A₀ = x [1/2, 1].\nLet B₀ = x [0, 1/2].\nA₀ U B₀ = S. A₀ ∩ B₀ = x {1/2}. One component.\n\nNow, let's modify A₀ and B₀.\nFrom B₀, let's add a \"finger\" going up into A₀.\nLet F₁ = [1/3, 2/3] x [1/2, 3/4].\nLet B₁ = B₀ U F₁. B₁ is connected.\nTo maintain the union as S, we must have A₁ U B₁ = S. So A₁ must be S \\ B₁? No, we need them to be closed.\nLet A₁ = cl(S \\ B₁).\nA₁ = cl( ( x (3/4, 1]) U ([0, 1/3) x [0, 3/4]) U ((2/3, 1] x [0, 3/4]) )\nA₁ = ( x [3/4, 1]) U ([0, 1/3] x [0, 3/4]) U ([2/3, 1] x [0, 3/4]).\nIs A₁ connected? Yes.\nWhat is A₁ ∩ B₁?\nA₁ ∩ B₁ = (( x [3/4, 1]) U ([0, 1/3] x [0, 3/4]) U ([2/3, 1] x [0, 3/4])) ∩ (( x [0, 1/2]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x [1/2, 3/4]))\n= ([0, 1/3] x {1/2}) U ([2/3, 1] x {1/2}) U ({1/3} x [1/2, 3/4]) U ({2/3} x [1/2, 3/4]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x {3/4}).\nThis intersection has two components. One is the union of the first and third segments, forming a U-shape. The other is the union of the second and fourth, a reversed U-shape. And the fifth segment on top. Let's check again.\nA₁ ∩ B₁ = (A₁ ∩ B₀) U (A₁ ∩ F₁)\nA₁ ∩ B₀ = (( x [3/4, 1]) U ([0, 1/3] x [0, 3/4]) U ([2/3, 1] x [0, 3/4])) ∩ ( x [0, 1/2])\n= ([0, 1/3] x [0, 1/2]) U ([2/3, 1] x [0, 1/2]). This has two components.\nA₁ ∩ F₁ = (( x [3/4, 1]) U ([0, 1/3] x [0, 3/4]) U ([2/3, 1] x [0, 3/4])) ∩ ([1/3, 2/3] x [1/2, 3/4])\n= ({1/3} x [1/2, 3/4]) U ({2/3} x [1/2, 3/4]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x {3/4}). This is a single connected component (a square bracket shape).\nThe total intersection is the union of these. The first part is two rectangles. The second part connects them.\nLet's re-evaluate A₁ ∩ B₁.\nThe boundary of B₁ is ( x {0}) U ({0} x [0, 1/2]) U ({1} x [0, 1/2]) U ([0, 1/3] x {1/2}) U ({1/3} x [1/2, 3/4]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x {3/4}) U ({2/3} x [1/2, 3/4]) U ([2/3, 1] x {1/2}).\nThe intersection A₁ ∩ B₁ is the boundary of B₁ inside the square.\nThis boundary is connected.\n\nLet's try to construct A and B such that their intersection is a finite set of points.\nLet A be the union of 4 squares and a central cross.\nA = ([0, 1/3] x [0, 1/3]) U ([2/3, 1] x [0, 1/3]) U ([0, 1/3] x [2/3, 1]) U ([2/3, 1] x [2/3, 1]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x) U ( x [1/3, 2/3]).\nThis set is connected and closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A).\nS \\ A is the union of 4 open rectangles: (1/3, 2/3) x (0, 1/3), etc. This is not connected. So B is not connected.\n\nLet's consider a different approach. What if the number of components can be arbitrarily large?\nLet's try to construct an example with N components.\nLet S be the unit square.\nLet's define N disjoint closed sets C₁, ..., Cₙ which will form the intersection. For simplicity, let them be vertical line segments.\nCᵢ = {i/(N+1)} x [1/3, 2/3] for i = 1, ..., N.\nLet A be a connected set containing all Cᵢ.\nLet B be a connected set containing all Cᵢ.\nA U B = S.\n\nLet A be the union of the top and bottom thirds of the square, connected by \"bridges\" that contain the Cᵢ.\nA = ( x [0, 1/3]) U ( x [2/3, 1]) U (Uᵢ Cᵢ).\nThis set A is connected and closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A).\nS \\ A is the union of N+1 open rectangles: (i/(N+1), (i+1)/(N+1)) x (1/3, 2/3) for i=0, ..., N.\nThis is disconnected. So B is disconnected.\n\nLet's try to make B connected.\nLet A = ( x [0, 1/3]) U ( x [2/3, 1]) U (U_{i is odd} {i/(N+1)} x [1/3, 2/3]).\nLet B = ( x [1/3, 2/3]) U (U_{i is even} {i/(N+1)} x ([0, 1/3] U [2/3, 1])).\nThis is getting very complicated.\n\nLet's search for a direct answer or a theorem. It seems this is a known problem in topology.\nA relevant result is that for any two closed sets A and B in the plane such that A U B is the sphere S², the number of components of A ∩ B is related to the number of components of A and B.\nLet's reconsider the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, but for reduced homology and for a pair (X, Y).\nLet X be the unit square. Let A and B be the two closed connected subsets.\nThe sequence is:\n... → H̃₁(A) ⊕ H̃₁(B) → H̃₁(X) → H̃₀(A ∩ B) → H̃₀(A) ⊕ H̃₀(B) → H̃₀(X) → 0.\nH̃₀(S) is the reduced 0th homology group. If S is non-empty and has k connected components, rank(H̃₀(S)) = k - 1.\nA, B, X are connected, so H̃₀(A) = H̃₀(B) = H̃₀(X) = 0.\nThe end of the sequence becomes:\n... → H̃₁(X) → H̃₀(A ∩ B) → 0.\nThis means the map from H̃₀(A ∩ B) to 0 is the zero map, and the map from H̃₁(X) to H̃₀(A ∩ B) is surjective.\nThe unit square is contractible, so all its reduced homology groups are 0. H̃₁(X) = 0.\nThis implies H̃₀(A ∩ B) = 0.\nIf the intersection A ∩ B is non-empty, this means it has 1 connected component.\nIf A ∩ B is empty, then A and B are two disjoint closed sets whose union is the connected set X. This is only possible if one of them is X and the other is empty, but both are connected, so this case is out. So A ∩ B is non-empty.\n\nThere must be a flaw in this reasoning. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence in its standard form applies to an excisive triad, which typically means we have two open sets covering the space. For closed sets, this might not hold.\n\nLet's try to construct an example where the intersection has infinitely many components.\nLet A be the \"topologist's sine curve\" closed.\nA = {(x, sin(1/x)) | 0 < x <= 1} U ({0} x [-1, 1]). Let's scale and translate this to fit in the square.\nLet A' be this set within the square, say in [0, 1/2] x. A' is connected and closed.\nLet B' = cl(S \\ A'). Is B' connected?\nThe complement of A' has two components (roughly, the area \"above\" the sine curve and the area \"below\"). The closure of the complement will likely be connected because the closure of both components will share the common boundary A'.\n\nLet's consider a construction that yields any finite number of components.\nLet n be the desired number of components.\nConsider n disjoint \"lakes\" (open disks) L₁, ..., Lₙ in the interior of the square S.\nLet L = U Lᵢ.\nLet A = S \\ L. This is the \"land\". A is connected if we ensure the lakes don't separate it.\nLet B be the union of the closures of the lakes: B = U cl(Lᵢ). B is disconnected, having n components.\nWe need both A and B to be connected.\n\nLet's use the Lakes of Wada idea. It's possible to construct three disjoint connected open sets in the plane, W₁, W₂, W₃, such that they have the same boundary: ∂W₁ = ∂W₂ = ∂W₃.\nLet's take the unit square S. We can construct two such \"lakes\" inside the square.\nLet W₁ and W₂ be two disjoint connected open sets in S such that ∂W₁ = ∂W₂.\nLet A = cl(W₁) and B = cl(W₂).\nA and B are closed. Are they connected? The closure of a connected set is connected. So yes.\nWhat is their union? Not the whole square.\nLet's define A = cl(W₁) and B = S \\ W₁.\nA is connected. Is B connected? B = cl(S \\ W₁) = cl(W₂ U ...). This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's try a simpler, more direct construction.\nLet S = x.\nLet A be the lower half of the square plus a set of vertical fingers pointing up.\nA = x [0, 1/2] U U_{k=1 to n} { (2k-1)/(2n) } x [1/2, 1]\nA is connected and closed.\nLet B be the upper half of the square plus a set of vertical fingers pointing down, in between the fingers of A.\nB = x [1/2, 1] U U_{k=1 to n-1} { (2k)/(2n) } x [0, 1/2]\nB is connected and closed.\nLet's check the union A U B.\nA U B = ( x [0, 1/2]) U ( x [1/2, 1]) U (fingers) = S. The union is the square.\nNow, the intersection A ∩ B.\nA ∩ B = ( x {1/2}) U (fingers of A ∩ upper half) U (fingers of B ∩ lower half).\nThe second and third terms are empty.\nSo A ∩ B = x {1/2}. This is connected.\n\nLet's modify the fingers.\nLet A = x [0, 1/2] U U_{k=1 to n} [ (2k-1.5)/(2n), (2k-0.5)/(2n) ] x [1/2, 1]. (Rectangular fingers)\nLet B = x [1/2, 1] U U_{k=1 to n} [ (2k-1)/(2n), (2k)/(2n) ] x [0, 1/2].\nThis is getting messy.\n\nLet's reconsider the Mayer-Vietoris argument. Why did it fail?\nThe sequence H₁(X) -> H₀(A∩B) -> H₀(A)⊕H₀(B) -> H₀(X) -> 0 is part of a long exact sequence.\nLet's write it out more fully for reduced homology:\n... -> H̃₁(A)⊕H̃₁(B) -> H̃₁(X) -> H̃₀(A∩B) -> H̃₀(A)⊕H̃₀(B) -> H̃₀(X) -> 0\nSince A, B, X are connected and non-empty, H̃₀(A) = H̃₀(B) = H̃₀(X) = 0.\nThe sequence becomes:\n... -> H̃₁(A)⊕H̃₁(B) -> H̃₁(X) -> H̃₀(A∩B) -> 0\nThis implies that the map from H̃₁(X) to H̃₀(A∩B) is surjective.\nSince X is the unit square, it is contractible, so H̃₁(X) = 0.\nThis means H̃₀(A∩B) must be 0.\nIf A∩B is non-empty, its reduced 0-th homology group being 0 means it has exactly one connected component.\n\nThe problem must be that the Mayer-Vietoris sequence does not apply here. The theorem usually requires that X is the union of the interiors of A and B. Here, A and B are closed. Let U = int(A) and V = int(B). Then U U V is not necessarily the whole square.\n\nLet's search for a counterexample to this naive use of Mayer-Vietoris.\nThe failure of the sequence for closed sets is key.\n\nLet's try to construct an example with infinitely many components.\nLet C be the Cantor set on the x-axis of the square, C x {1/2}.\nLet A be the lower closed half of the square, plus the Cantor set. A =x[0,1/2] U (C x {1/2}). A is connected. (The lower half is connected, and every point in C x {1/2} is a limit point of it). No, this is not correct. A is not connected. The points in C x {1/2} are not connected to the lower half.\nLet A =x[0,1/2]. Let B =x[1/2,1]. Both are connected. Union is the square. Intersection is the linex{1/2}, which is connected.\n\nLet's use a space-filling curve. Let f: ->x be a continuous surjective map.\nLet A = f([0, 1/2]) and B = f([1/2, 1]).\nA and B are connected (continuous images of connected sets).\nA and B are closed (continuous images of compact sets).\nA U B = f([0, 1/2] U [1/2, 1]) = f() = S.\nA ∩ B = f([0, 1/2]) ∩ f([1/2, 1]). This intersection contains f(1/2). Is it just that point? Not necessarily. A space-filling curve has many self-intersections. The set of self-intersection points can be quite complex. It is known that there exist space-filling curves that are not injective on any subinterval.\nThe intersection A ∩ B could be large and connected.\n\nLet's consider the boundary between A and B.\nLet A and B be two closed connected sets with A U B = S.\nLet ∂A and ∂B be their boundaries.\nA ∩ B = (A ∩ ∂B) U (B ∩ ∂A) U (int(A) ∩ int(B)).\nAlso, A ∩ B = ∂A ∩ ∂B. This is not necessarily true.\nBut A ∩ B is the boundary of A with respect to B, and vice-versa.\nLet X = S. The boundary of A in X is ∂A = A ∩ cl(X \\ A) = A ∩ cl(B \\ A).\nThe boundary of B in X is ∂B = B ∩ cl(X \\ B) = B ∩ cl(A \\ B).\nA ∩ B = (A \\ int(A)) ∩ (B \\ int(B)) = ∂A ∩ ∂B? No.\n\nLet's try one more construction.\nLet A be the graph of y = sin(1/x) with the limiting segment on the y-axis, but thickened slightly to be a closed set with non-empty interior.\nLet B be the closure of the complement.\nThis seems to be the most promising direction.\nLet C be the topologist's sine curve, scaled to fit in the square. C is connected and closed.\nLet A be a closed \"epsilon-neighborhood\" of C in the square. A is connected and closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). B is closed. Is B connected?\nThe set S \\ A is open. The curve C divides the plane (locally) into regions. The neighborhood A will cover these divisions. S \\ A will be the area \"away\" from the curve. It seems S \\ A should be connected. If S \\ A is connected, its closure B is also connected.\nSo we have A and B, both closed and connected, and their union is S.\nWhat is their intersection? A ∩ B = A ∩ cl(S \\ A) = ∂A (the boundary of A).\nThe boundary of this thickened sine curve will be two curves that follow the sine wave, plus some segments on the boundary of the square and on the y-axis part. This boundary is connected.\n\nIt seems that no matter what I construct, the intersection is connected. This points back to the Mayer-Vietoris sequence result, even though its application was questionable. Perhaps there is a version for closed sets that yields the same conclusion for this specific case (X being contractible).\n\nLet's assume the answer is not 1. Let's say it's 2.\nThere exist A, B closed connected, A U B = S, and A ∩ B has 2 components, C₁ and C₂.\nLet's try to visualize this. A and B must both \"contain\" C₁ and C₂.\nA must provide a path between C₁ and C₂.\nB must also provide a path between C₁ and C₂.\nThe union of A and B must cover the whole square.\n\nImagine C₁ and C₂ as two islands.\nA is the two islands plus a bridge between them.\nB is the two islands plus another bridge between them.\nLet C₁ = [1/4, 1/3]x[1/2, 1/2] and C₂ = [2/3, 3/4]x[1/2, 1/2].\nLet Bridge_A = [1/3, 2/3]x[2/3, 3/4].\nLet Bridge_B = [1/3, 2/3]x[1/4, 1/3].\nLet A' = C₁ U C₂ U Bridge_A. This is connected.\nLet B' = C₁ U C₂ U Bridge_B. This is connected.\nA' ∩ B' = C₁ U C₂. This has two components.\nBut A' U B' is not the square.\nLet A = A' and B = cl(S \\ A').\nA is closed and connected.\nS \\ A' is connected. So B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = A ∩ cl(S \\ A') = ∂A'.\nThe boundary of A' is connected.\n\nThere is a theorem by Knaster and Kuratowski that states that if S is a connected set and C is a component of S \\ A, where A is a closed subset of S, then S \\ C is connected. This is related but not directly applicable.\n\nLet's reconsider the example from the search result: \"two intervals on a circle where neither is the whole circle, but where the union is the whole circle. Each interval is connected, but the intersection will have two components.\"\nLet the circle be S¹. Let A be an arc from 0 to 2π/3. Let B be an arc from π/3 to 2π.\nA is connected. B is connected. A U B = S¹.\nA ∩ B is the union of two arcs: [π/3, 2π/3] and {0} U {2π} which is one point on the circle. So two components.\nCan we adapt this to the square? The boundary of the square is a circle.\nLet A be the boundary of the square from (0,0) to (1, 1/2) going clockwise.\nLet B be the boundary from (1,0) to (0, 1/2) going clockwise.\nUnion is the boundary. Intersection has two points.\nBut we need the union to be the whole square.\n\nLet A be the square with a \"lake\" removed. Let B be the closure of the lake.\nIf the lake is an open annulus (a ring), then A is connected. B is a closed annulus, also connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = boundary of the annulus, which has two components (the inner and outer circles).\nSo we have an example with 2 components.\nLet S = [-2, 2] x [-2, 2].\nLet L = {p | 1 < |p| < 2} be the open annulus.\nLet A = S \\ L. A is connected. A is closed.\nLet B = cl(L) = {p | 1 <= |p| <= 2}. B is connected. B is closed.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = (S \\ L) ∩ cl(L) = ∂(cl(L)) = {p | |p|=1} U {p | |p|=2}.\nThis is the union of two disjoint circles. It has 2 connected components.\nWe can scale this to the unit square.\n\nCan we have more?\nLet's remove N disjoint annuli from the square.\nLet L_i be disjoint open annuli. Let L = U L_i.\nLet A = S \\ L. A is connected (the \"land\" is connected). A is closed.\nLet B = cl(L) = U cl(L_i). B is disconnected, with N components. We need B to be connected.\n\nLet's modify the construction.\nLet B be a set with \"holes\". Let A fill the holes and the rest.\nLet B be the square with N open disks D_i removed, and then connect the boundaries of these holes to the outer boundary of the square with thin \"canals\". This makes B connected.\nLet B = cl(S \\ (U D_i U U C_j)), where D_i are open disks and C_j are open canals.\nLet A = cl(U D_i U U C_j).\nThis is getting too complex.\n\nLet's go back to the annulus example. It provides 2 components.\nCan we construct an example with 3 components?\nLet B be a closed set with 2 holes. For B to be connected, the two holes must not separate it.\nLet B be the square with two disjoint open disks D1, D2 removed. B = S \\ (D1 U D2). B is connected.\nLet A = cl(D1 U D2) = cl(D1) U cl(D2). A is not connected.\n\nLet's try another way.\nLet A be a set. Let B = cl(S \\ A). We need A and B to be connected.\nThis means that A must be connected, and S \\ A must be connected.\nA set A for which both A and its complement are connected is called a \"non-separating\" set.\nThe boundary of such a set A, which is A ∩ cl(S \\ A) = A ∩ B, is the intersection we are looking for.\nIt is a known theorem that the boundary of a connected open set in the plane is not necessarily connected.\nThe Lakes of Wada is an example where a single boundary separates three regions. The boundary itself must be connected.\n\nLet's reconsider the annulus.\nLet S be the unit square.\nLet D_inner be the open disk with center (1/2, 1/2) and radius 1/4.\nLet D_outer be the open set of points outside the circle of radius 1/3 centered at (1/2, 1/2).\nLet A = cl(D_inner). A is a closed disk, so it's connected.\nLet B = cl(S \\ D_inner). B is the square with an open disk removed. B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = cl(D_inner) ∩ cl(S \\ D_inner) = ∂(D_inner). This is a circle, which is connected.\n\nLet's go back to the two-component example.\nLet S be the square.\nLet R1 be the closed rectangle [1/4, 3/4] x [1/4, 3/4].\nLet R2 be the closed frame made by the boundary of the square and the boundary of a smaller square, say [1/8, 7/8] x [1/8, 7/8].\nLet A = R1. A is connected.\nLet B = S \\ int(R1). B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = R1 ∩ (S \\ int(R1)) = ∂R1. This is a single square, connected.\n\nThere must be a way to make the intersection disconnected.\nLet's take a set A. Let B = cl(S \\ A). The intersection is the boundary of A.\nWe need to find a connected set A in the square such that its complement is also connected, and its boundary is not connected.\nConsider the plane R². Let A be the union of two disjoint closed disks D1, D2 and a line segment L connecting them. A is connected.\nThe complement R² \\ A is connected.\nThe boundary of A is ∂D1 U ∂D2. This has two components.\nNow, let's adapt this to the square S.\nLet D1 and D2 be two disjoint closed disks in the interior of S.\nLet L be a closed line segment connecting a point on ∂D1 to a point on ∂D2, and otherwise disjoint from D1 and D2.\nLet A = D1 U D2 U L. A is closed and connected.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). Is S \\ A connected? Yes. So B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂A = (∂D1 \\ L) U (∂D2 \\ L) U (boundary of L). The boundary of L adds two segments to the boundaries of the disks. The result is still two disjoint closed curves. So the intersection has 2 components.\n\nCan we do 3?\nLet A = D1 U D2 U D3 U L12 U L23, where L12 connects D1 and D2, and L23 connects D2 and D3.\nA is connected. S \\ A is connected.\nThe boundary ∂A has 3 components.\n\nIt seems we can construct an arbitrary finite number of components.\nLet D_1, ..., D_n be n disjoint closed disks in the interior of the square S.\nLet L_i be a closed line segment connecting D_i to D_{i+1} for i=1, ..., n-1.\nLet A = (U D_i) U (U L_i).\nA is closed and connected.\nS \\ A is an open connected set (it's a region with n+1 \"holes\" that are all connected \"outside\"). So B = cl(S \\ A) is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂A. The boundary of A consists of n disjoint closed curves.\nSo, the intersection has n components.\n\nThis means there is no largest finite number. The answer must be infinite.\nCan we construct an example with a countably infinite number of components?\nLet D_i be a sequence of disjoint closed disks, D_i, for i=1, 2, 3, ...\nLet their radii converge to 0, and let them converge to a point.\nFor example, D_i is centered at (1/i, 1/2) with radius 1/(3i²).\nLet A be the union of these disks and line segments connecting them.\nA = (U_{i=1 to ∞} D_i) U (U_{i=1 to ∞} L_i), where L_i connects D_i and D_{i+1}.\nWe need A to be closed. The limit point (0, 1/2) must be in A.\nLet A = (U_{i=1 to ∞} D_i) U (U_{i=1 to ∞} L_i) U {(0, 1/2)}.\nA is connected. A is closed.\nS \\ A is connected. So B = cl(S \\ A) is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂A.\nThe boundary of A consists of infinitely many disjoint closed curves (the boundaries of the disks, modified by the connecting segments).\nSo, the intersection can have a countably infinite number of components.\n\nThe question asks for the *largest number* of components. If we can have any finite number, and even a countably infinite number, is there an upper bound at all? Can we have uncountably many?\n\nLet C be the Cantor set on. Let A = C x. This is closed. Its components are the vertical segments {c} x for each c in C. There are uncountably many components. So A is not connected.\n\nLet's go back to the construction with the disks.\nA = (U_{i=1 to ∞} D_i) U (U_{i=1 to ∞} L_i) U {(0, 1/2)}.\nThe intersection is ∂A. This consists of countably many loops.\nSo the number of components can be countably infinite.\n\nIs it possible to have uncountably many components?\nThe components of the intersection A ∩ B are disjoint closed sets.\nLet {C_alpha} be the collection of connected components of A ∩ B. Each C_alpha is a closed set.\nBeing disjoint, we can find disjoint open sets U_alpha containing each C_alpha.\nIf there are uncountably many, this seems to contradict the separability of the plane (which has a countable base of open sets).\nAny collection of disjoint open sets in a separable space must be countable.\nSo, the number of components must be at most countable (finite or countably infinite).\n\nSo the largest number of components is countably infinite. The question asks for \"the largest number\". This usually implies a finite number. Perhaps there is a subtlety I am missing.\n\nLet's re-read the question: \"What is the largest number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets?\"\nIf any finite number N is possible, then there is no largest finite number. In this context, \"largest number\" could mean \"is there a finite upper bound, and if so what is it?\". If there is no finite upper bound, the answer is infinity.\n\nLet's confirm the construction for N components.\nLet D_k = disk of radius r centered at (x_k, 1/2), for k=1,...,N. Choose x_k and r small enough so they are disjoint and in the interior of the square S.\nLet L_k be the line segment from (x_k+r, 1/2) to (x_{k+1}-r, 1/2) for k=1,...,N-1.\nLet A = (U D_k) U (U L_k). This is a shape like a dumbbell with N weights.\nA is closed and connected.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A).\nS \\ A is the square with a dumbbell-shaped hole. This is a connected open set.\nSo B is a connected closed set.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂A.\nThe boundary of A consists of N disjoint closed curves, each one being the boundary of a disk with two points removed, and two copies of a line segment. Each of these is a simple closed curve.\nSo we have N components.\nSince N can be any positive integer, there is no finite upper bound.\n\nThe answer should be infinity. In the context of such questions, if there is no finite bound, infinity is the answer.\n\nLet's double check the argument that the number of components must be countable.\nLet {C_i} be the collection of connected components of the intersection I = A ∩ B.\nThe components are disjoint. Since I is closed, each component C_i is also closed.\nSince they are disjoint closed sets, the distance between any two, d(C_i, C_j), is positive.\nFor each C_i, we can find a rational point (a point with rational coordinates) in its vicinity.\nThis is not enough.\nHowever, the components C_i form a partition of I into disjoint closed sets.\nLet's consider the open sets U_i = {p in S | d(p, C_i) < d(p, I \\ C_i) / 2}. These are disjoint open sets, each containing one component.\nThe plane R² is a separable space, meaning it has a countable dense subset (QxQ) and a countable basis of open sets.\nA collection of disjoint open sets in a separable space is at most countable.\nLet {U_alpha} be a collection of disjoint open sets in R². Let D be a countable dense subset. For each alpha, U_alpha must contain at least one point d_alpha from D. Since the U_alpha are disjoint, all the d_alpha are distinct. Since D is countable, the collection {U_alpha} must be countable.\nSo, the number of components must be at most countable.\n\nWe have shown that any finite number N is possible, and we have sketched an argument for a countably infinite number of components.\nTherefore, there is no finite maximum. The \"largest number\" is infinity.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Are A and B closed? Yes, by construction. A is a finite union of closed sets. B is a closure of a set.\n2.  Are A and B connected? Yes. A is connected by construction. B is the closure of a connected set, so it is connected.\n3.  Is A U B = S? Yes. B = cl(S \\ A), so A U B = A U cl(S \\ A) = cl(A U (S \\ A)) = cl(S) = S.\n4.  How many components in A ∩ B? A ∩ B = ∂A. The boundary of our dumbbell set A with N disks has N components.\nSince N can be any integer, there is no finite upper bound.\n\nThe question does not specify \"finite number\". Therefore, infinity is a valid answer.\n\nLet's refine the countably infinite case.\nLet D_n be the closed disk with center (1/n, 1/2) and radius 1/(4n^2) for n=1, 2, ...\nLet L_n be the line segment connecting the rightmost point of D_{n+1} to the leftmost point of D_n.\nLet A = (U_{n=1 to inf} D_n) U (U_{n=1 to inf} L_n) U {(0, 1/2)}.\nA is closed. The disks and segments converge to (0, 1/2), which is included.\nA is connected.\nB = cl(S \\ A). S \\ A is connected. So B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂A.\nThe boundary of A consists of countably many disjoint loops.\nSo, countably infinite components are possible.\n\nThe largest number of components is therefore infinity (or more precisely, countably infinite).Let the two closed connected subsets of the unit square `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]` be denoted by `A` and `B`. We are given that `A` and `B` are closed, connected, and their union `A U B` is the entire square `S`. We want to find the maximum possible number of connected components of their intersection, `A ∩ B`.\n\nFirst, let's establish that the intersection can have more than one component.\n\n### Construction for a Finite Number of Components (N)\n\nWe can construct two sets `A` and `B` such that their intersection has any arbitrary finite number of components, `N`.\n\n1.  **Define the components of the intersection**: Let's create `N` disjoint closed sets within the interior of the square `S`. For simplicity, we can use closed disks. Let `D_1, D_2, ..., D_N` be `N` disjoint closed disks in the interior of `S`.\n\n2.  **Construct the set A**: To make `A` a single connected set, we can take the union of these disks and connect them with thin strips or line segments. Let `L_i` be a closed line segment connecting a point on disk `D_i` to a point on disk `D_{i+1}` for `i = 1, ..., N-1`. Let the segments `L_i` be disjoint from each other and from the disks, except at their endpoints.\n    Let `A = D_1 U D_2 U ... U D_N U L_1 U ... U L_{N-1}`.\n    This set `A` is a union of closed sets, and since there are finitely many, `A` is closed. By its construction (a chain of disks and segments), `A` is connected.\n\n3.  **Construct the set B**: Let `B` be the closure of the complement of `A` in the square `S`. That is, `B = cl(S \\ A)`.\n    *   Since `B` is the closure of a set, it is a closed set.\n    *   The set `S \\ A` is the square with a \"dumbbell\" or \"chain of beads\" shape removed from its interior. This set is open and connected. The closure of a connected set is connected, therefore `B` is connected.\n\n4.  **Verify the union**: The union of `A` and `B` is `A U cl(S \\ A)`. The union of a set and the closure of its complement is the entire space. So, `A U B = S`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the intersection**: The intersection of the two sets is `A ∩ B = A ∩ cl(S \\ A)`. This is precisely the boundary of `A` within the square `S`, denoted `∂A`.\n    The boundary of our set `A` consists of the boundaries of the `N` disks, slightly modified where the line segments attach. Each of these `N` boundaries forms a separate closed loop. These loops are disjoint from each other.\n    Therefore, the intersection `A ∩ B` has `N` connected components.\n\nSince we can construct an example for any positive integer `N`, there is no finite upper bound on the number of components.\n\n### Countably Infinite Components\n\nThe construction can be extended to a countably infinite number of components.\n\n1.  **Define the components**: Let `D_n` for `n = 1, 2, ...` be a sequence of disjoint closed disks whose radii and positions are chosen such that they converge to a single point within the square (e.g., disks centered at `(1/n, 1/2)` with radii `1/(4n^2)`).\n\n2.  **Construct A**: Connect these disks with line segments `L_n` (connecting `D_n` and `D_{n+1}`). To ensure `A` is closed, we must include the limit point of the disks and segments. Let `P` be this limit point.\n    Let `A = (U_{n=1 to ∞} D_n) U (U_{n=1 to ∞} L_n) U {P}`.\n    This set `A` is closed and connected.\n\n3.  **Construct B**: As before, let `B = cl(S \\ A)`. `S \\ A` is connected, so `B` is connected.\n\n4.  **Union and Intersection**: `A U B = S`, and the intersection `A ∩ B = ∂A`. The boundary of this infinite chain of disks consists of a countably infinite number of disjoint loops.\n\n### Upper Bound on the Number of Components\n\nThe number of components cannot be uncountably infinite. The connected components of any space form a partition of that space into disjoint sets. In a separable space like the plane or the square (which has a countable basis of open sets), any collection of disjoint open sets must be countable. Since each connected component of the intersection is a closed set, and they are disjoint, we can construct a collection of disjoint open sets, each containing one component. This forces the number of components to be at most countable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the number of components can be any finite number `N`, and can also be countably infinite, there is no largest finite number of components. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is infinite.\n\n<<<∞>>>"
