    "It is not possible to provide a number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\" This is because \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a specific, countable ballet step.\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" refers to the broader technique and style of choreographer George Balanchine, which is characterized by extreme speed, deep plié, and an emphasis on athletic, linear movements. While Forsythe's choreographic style was influenced by Balanchine, his work, including \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" is distinct and not a direct application of the Balanchine technique.\n\nSvetlana Gileva did perform the \"Jete Woman\" solo as part of the Semperoper Ballett's production of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" in 2015. However, one cannot count the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" in this or any other piece of choreography, as it is a stylistic quality rather than a discrete step like a \"pas de cheval\" or a \"balancé\".\n\n<<<It is impossible to count the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" as it is a style of movement, not a specific step.>>>"
