The effective electron-electron interaction, mediated by phonons, is given by the potential $U_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{q}, \nu_n)$ in momentum and Matsubara frequency space. For a given momentum transfer $\mathbf{q}$, the interaction is:

$U_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{q}, \nu_n) = \frac{g^2 |\mathbf{q}|^2}{m} \frac{1}{\nu_n^2 + \omega_q^2}$

where:
*   $g$ is the electron-phonon coupling constant.
*   $|\mathbf{q}|$ is the magnitude of the momentum transfer vector.
*   $m$ is the mass term from the Hamiltonian.
*   $\nu_n$ is the bosonic Matsubara frequency.
*   $\omega_q$ is the phonon frequency at momentum $\mathbf{q}$.

This interaction is attractive. In the static limit ($\nu_n=0$), it becomes $U_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{q}, 0) = \frac{g^2 |\mathbf{q}|^2}{m \omega_q^2}$. This phonon-mediated attraction is the mechanism responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs in conventional superconductors. The full effective Hamiltonian describing this interaction is $H_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathbf{q}, \nu_n} U_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{q}, \nu_n) \rho_{\mathbf{q}, \nu_n} \rho_{-\mathbf{q}, -\nu_n}$.
