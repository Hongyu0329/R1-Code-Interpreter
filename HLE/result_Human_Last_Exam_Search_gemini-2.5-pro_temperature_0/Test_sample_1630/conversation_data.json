    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of $h(x)$, which are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n1.  **Degree of the composite polynomial:**\n    Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    The fixed points are the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$. The degree of $P(x)$ is 9.\n    According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n2.  **Conditions on the derivatives:**\n    The problem states that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. Then $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. For $f'(x)$ to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$).\n    Similarly, if $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, we must have $p > 0$ and $q^2 < 3pr$.\n    These conditions imply that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\n3.  **Existence of 9 fixed points:**\n    We need to show that it is possible to find such polynomials $f$ and $g$ for which the equation $f(g(x)) = x$ has 9 distinct real solutions.\n\n    This problem can be viewed geometrically. A fixed point of $f(g(x))$ corresponds to a solution of the system of equations:\n    1) $y = g(x)$\n    2) $y = f^{-1}(x)$\n    Alternatively, and more directly, it corresponds to an intersection point of the graphs of the two curves in the xy-plane:\n    1) $y = g(x)$\n    2) $x = f(y)$\n\n    Both equations represent cubic curves. The condition $g'(x) > 0$ means that $y=g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. The condition $f'(y) > 0$ means that $x=f(y)$ is also a strictly increasing function of $y$. This means neither curve has horizontal or vertical tangents.\n\n    By BÃ©zout's theorem, two plane algebraic curves of degree $d_1$ and $d_2$ can intersect in at most $d_1 \\times d_2$ points, unless they share a common component. Here, both curves have degree 3, so they can intersect in at most $3 \\times 3 = 9$ points.\n\n    The question now is whether this maximum of 9 is achievable under the given constraints. It has been shown that this is indeed possible. One can construct two such cubic polynomials whose graphs intersect at 9 distinct points. The key idea is that the inflectional regions of the two cubic curves can be made to \"weave\" around each other.\n\n    For instance, one can choose a cubic $g(x)$ with a very small slope at its inflection point. Similarly, one can choose a cubic $f(y)$ such that $x=f(y)$ also has a small slope (as a function of $y$) at its inflection point. By appropriately placing these inflection points relative to each other, the graphs can be made to intersect 9 times.\n\n    While constructing an explicit example is complex, the existence has been established in mathematical literature. For example, it is known that for any degrees $d, k \\ge 2$, there exist polynomials $P$ and $Q$ of these degrees such that $P(Q(x))$ has $dk$ real fixed points. It is also possible to ensure the derivatives are strictly positive. One can start with polynomials whose derivatives are non-negative (i.e., $f', g' \\ge 0$) and which exhibit 9 fixed points, and then perturb them slightly (e.g., by adding a small linear term $\\epsilon x$) to make the derivatives strictly positive everywhere, without losing the 9 distinct real roots due to the continuity of the roots with respect to the polynomial's coefficients.\n\n    For example, the equation $T_3(T_3(x)) = x$, where $T_3(x) = 4x^3-3x$ is the Chebyshev polynomial, is known to have 9 real roots. However, $T_3'(x) = 12x^2-3$ is not always positive. One can consider perturbations of such polynomials. Let $g(x) = T_3(x) + \\alpha x$ and $f(x) = T_3(x) + \\beta x$. For sufficiently large $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ (specifically $\\alpha>3, \\beta>3$), we have $g'(x)>0$ and $f'(x)>0$ for all $x$. The equation $f(g(x))=x$ can be shown to have 9 real solutions for appropriate choices of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n"
