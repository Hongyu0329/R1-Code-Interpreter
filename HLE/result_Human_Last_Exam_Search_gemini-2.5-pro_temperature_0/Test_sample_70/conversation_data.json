    "When viewed as matrices, the flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark are those of Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria.\n\nTo determine this, the rank of each flag's design is maximized by treating each distinct color as a linearly independent vector. The rank is then equivalent to the number of linearly independent row or column patterns in the flag's design.\n\n*   **Flag of Denmark:** The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white cross. This design creates two unique row patterns: a row that is entirely white (the horizontal part of the cross) and a row that is red, white, and red. These two patterns are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Flag of Nigeria:** The Nigerian flag features three vertical stripes, with green on the outer stripes and white in the center. This creates two distinct column patterns: an all-green column and an all-white column. As these are linearly independent, the flag's rank is 2.\n\n*   **Flag of Benin:** The flag of Benin has a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of yellow and red. This design results in two unique row patterns: one of \"green and yellow\" and another of \"green and red.\" These two patterns are linearly independent, giving the flag a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Flag of Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar is composed of a vertical white band at the hoist with horizontal red and green bands. Similar to Benin's flag, this creates two linearly independent row patterns (\"white and red\" and \"white and green\"), resulting in a rank of 2.\n\nOther African flags have more complex designs, such as multiple stripes of different colors, intricate emblems, or diagonal elements, which lead to a rank higher than 2.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria>>>"
