    "An analysis of the chess position with the FEN `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` reveals a forced checkmate for White, assuming optimal play from both sides.\n\nThe winning sequence of moves is as follows:\n1.  **Rxe1** (White's only move) **Qxe1+**\n2.  **Kh2** (White's only move) **g6** (Black's best defense to create an escape square and block the bishop)\n3.  **Qxf7+** **Kh8**\n4.  **Nxg6+** **hxg6**\n5.  **Bxg6** **Qh4** (Black delays the inevitable mate)\n6.  **Qf8#**\n\nCounting the moves made by White to deliver the checkmate:\n1. Rxe1\n2. Kh2\n3. Qxf7+\n4. Nxg6+\n5. Bxg6\n6. Qf8#\n\nWhite delivers checkmate in 6 moves.\n\n<<<6>>>"
