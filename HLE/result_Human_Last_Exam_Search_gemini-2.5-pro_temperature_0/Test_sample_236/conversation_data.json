    "Three distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings. These elements are the trivial element, the Poincaré homology sphere, and its mirror image.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the knots with four or fewer crossings and the results of integral surgery on them:\n\n*   **The Unknot (0₁):** An integral surgery on the unknot results in the 3-sphere, S³. In the context of the homology cobordism group, S³ represents the trivial (or identity) element.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):** This is the simplest non-trivial knot.\n    *   A +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot produces the Poincaré homology sphere. This is a non-trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   A -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot yields the mirror image of the Poincaré homology sphere. This is also a non-trivial element and is the inverse of the element represented by the Poincaré sphere.\n    *   Surgeries on the left-handed trefoil produce the same two elements but with the signs of the surgery coefficients reversed.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** This is the only knot with four crossings. The figure-eight knot is what is known as a slice knot, and its Arf invariant is zero. For any knot with an Arf invariant of zero, performing a +1 or -1 surgery results in a homology sphere that is homology cobordant to S³. Therefore, both +1 and -1 surgeries on the figure-eight knot produce the trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n\nIn summary, the distinct elements obtained are:\n1.  The trivial element (from the unknot and the figure-eight knot).\n2.  The Poincaré homology sphere (from the trefoil knot).\n3.  The mirror image of the Poincaré homology sphere (from the trefoil knot).\n\nThus, a total of three such elements can be represented.\n\n<<<3>>>"
