    "The problem is to design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system. This requires finding an observer gain matrix `L` such that the estimation error converges to zero in the shortest possible number of time steps. The standard full-order observer is described by the equation:\n\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C x̂(k))\n\nThe error dynamics of this observer are governed by the matrix `(A - LC)`. For a deadbeat response, this matrix must be nilpotent, meaning that `(A - LC)^q = 0` for some integer `q`. The shortest possible number of steps for the error to become zero in a full-order observer is determined by the observability index, `ν`, of the system pair (A, C).\n\nThe design process involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Observability Index (ν):** The observability index is the smallest integer `q` for which the observability matrix `O_q = [C; CA; ...; CA^(q-1)]` has a rank equal to the dimension of the state vector, `n`. For the given system, `n=4`.\n    *   The rank of `[C]` is 2.\n    *   The rank of `[C; CA]` is 3.\n    *   The rank of `[C; CA; CA^2]` is 4.\n    Therefore, the observability index `ν` is 3. This means the error can be made to vanish in 3 steps.\n\n2.  **Design the Gain Matrix L:** The goal is to find a 4x2 matrix `L` such that `(A - LC)³ = 0`. A systematic way to achieve this is to transform the system into a more convenient coordinate system, design the gain there, and then transform it back.\n\n    *   **Coordinate Transformation:** We can reorder the state vector to group the directly measured states. The output `y(k)` gives direct information about `x₁(k)` and `x₄(k)`. Let's define a new state vector `x_new = [x₁; x₄; x₂; x₃]`.\n    *   **Design in New Coordinates:** In this new system, a gain matrix `L_new` is designed to make the error dynamics matrix `A_e = A_new - L_new*C_new` nilpotent with an index of 3. A suitable choice for `A_e` that satisfies this is:\n        `A_e = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]`\n        Solving for `L_new` that achieves this structure yields:\n        `L_new = [[-2, 1], [0, -1], [-1, 2], [1, -1]]`\n    *   **Transform Back to Original Coordinates:** The gain matrix `L` for the original system is found by applying the inverse coordinate transformation to `L_new`.\n\nThe resulting observer gain matrix is:\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\nWith this gain matrix, the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` becomes nilpotent with an index of 3, ensuring the observation error becomes identically zero in 3 steps, which is the shortest possible time for a full-order observer.\n\n<<<L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
