    "The user is asking for the connectivity of a specific map in algebraic topology. My initial analysis identified the key components and relevant theorems like the Hilton-Milnor theorem. The search results provide some context on Samelson products, Whitehead products, and the homotopy theory of loop spaces, which are the relevant concepts here.\n\nLet's break down the problem further based on the search results and my initial knowledge.\n*   **The map:** `f: Σ ( ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6 ) → Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)`\n*   **Connectivity of a map:** A map `f: X → Y` is `k`-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups `f_*: π_i(X) → π_i(Y)` is an isomorphism for `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of `f` being `(k-1)`-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of spaces involved:**\n    *   `S^4` is 3-connected. `S^6` is 5-connected.\n    *   `ΩS^4` is 2-connected. `ΩS^6` is 4-connected.\n    *   The smash product `ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6` is `(2 + 4 + 1) = 7`-connected.\n    *   The suspension `Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)` is `7 + 1 = 8`-connected.\n    *   The smash product `S^4 ∧ S^6` is `(3 + 5 + 1) = 9`-connected.\n    *   The loop space `Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)` is `9 - 1 = 8`-connected.\n\nBoth the domain and codomain of the map are 8-connected. This means we need to investigate the map on `π_i` for `i ≥ 9`.\n\nThe map is an instance of the more general map `Σ(ΩX ∧ ΩY) → Ω(X ∧ Y)`. This map is closely related to the Samelson product and the Whitehead product. The Samelson product of two maps `f: A → G` and `g: B → G` into an H-space `G` is a map `⟨f, g⟩: A ∧ B → G`. The map in question is related to the adjoint of a Samelson product.\n\nLet's consider the general case. There is a well-known map `j: ΣΩX → X`, which is the adjoint to the identity map on `ΩX`. The Freudenthal suspension theorem gives the connectivity of this map. For an `n`-connected space `X`, the map `η: X → ΩΣX` has a `(2n)`-connected fiber. The map `j` is `(2*conn(X)+1)`-connected.\n*   For `X = S^4`, `conn(X)=3`, so `j: ΣΩS^4 → S^4` is 7-connected.\n*   For `X = S^6`, `conn(X)=5`, so `j: ΣΩS^6 → S^6` is 11-connected.\n\nThe map `Σ(ΩX ∧ ΩY) → Ω(X ∧ Y)` can be seen as a mixed version of the evaluation map. A key result by G.W. Whitehead states that for `(n-1)`-connected and `(m-1)`-connected CW-complexes `X` and `Y`, the natural map `Σ(ΩX ∧ ΩY) → Ω(X ∧ Y)` is `(n+m-2)`-connected. This result can be found in his book \"Elements of Homotopy Theory\".\n\nLet's apply this theorem to our specific case.\n*   `X = S^4`, so it is `(4-1) = 3`-connected. Here `n=4`.\n*   `Y = S^6`, so it is `(6-1) = 5`-connected. Here `m=6`.\n\nAccording to Whitehead's theorem, the connectivity of the map `Σ ( ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)` is `n + m - 2 = 4 + 6 - 2 = 8`.\n\nLet's double-check this.\nThe connectivity of a map `f` is `k` if `π_i(f)` is an isomorphism for `i < k` and a surjection for `i=k`.\nSo, an 8-connected map means `π_i` is an isomorphism for `i < 8` and a surjection for `i=8`.\n\nLet's re-verify the connectivity of the spaces.\n*   `A = Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)` is 8-connected. `π_i(A) = 0` for `i ≤ 8`.\n*   `B = Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)` is 8-connected. `π_i(B) = 0` for `i ≤ 8`.\n\nFor `i < 8`, `π_i(A) = π_i(B) = 0`, so the map is trivially an isomorphism.\nFor `i = 8`, `π_8(A) = π_8(B) = 0`, so the map is again an isomorphism.\nThe first interesting group is `π_9`.\n`π_9(Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)) = H_9(Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6))` by Hurewicz theorem, which is `H_8(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)`.\n`H_8(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) = H_3(ΩS^4) ⊗ H_5(ΩS^6) = H_4(S^4) ⊗ H_6(S^6) = Z ⊗ Z = Z`.\n`π_9(Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)) = π_{10}(S^4 ∧ S^6)`. Since `S^4 ∧ S^6` is `S^{10}` in low dimensions, `π_{10}(S^4 ∧ S^6) = Z`.\n\nThe theorem states the map is `(n+m-2)`-connected. This means the fiber `F` of the map has `π_i(F) = 0` for `i < n+m-2`.\nIn our case, `n=4, m=6`, so the connectivity is 8. This means `π_i(F) = 0` for `i < 8`.\nFrom the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration `F → Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) → Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)`, we have:\n`... → π_i(F) → π_i(Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)) → π_i(Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)) → π_{i-1}(F) → ...`\nFor `i < 8`, all groups are zero.\nFor `i=8`, `π_8(Σ(...)) = 0` and `π_8(Ω(...)) = 0`, so `π_8(F)` and `π_7(F)` are surrounded by zeros, implying `π_7(F)=0`.\nThe connectivity of the map is `k` if `π_i(F)=0` for `i < k`. So the map is at least 8-connected.\n\nThe theorem of Whitehead gives the precise connectivity. The result is a standard, albeit advanced, fact in homotopy theory.\n\nFinal check of the connectivity value: `n+m-2`.\nFor `X=S^n` and `Y=S^m`, the map `Σ(ΩS^n ∧ ΩS^m) → Ω(S^n ∧ S^m)` is `(n+m-2)`-connected.\nWith `n=4` and `m=6`, this is `4+6-2=8`.\n\nThe question asks for the connectivity of the map. The answer is an integer.\n\nFinal answer seems to be 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
