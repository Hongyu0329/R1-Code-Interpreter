    "For the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, we first identify the indecomposable modules and the Auslander-Reiten (AR) translation $\\tau$. The algebra $A$ is of type $A_3$ with linear orientation. The indecomposable modules can be represented by intervals $[i,j]$ where $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. Let $M_{[i,j]}$ denote the module corresponding to the interval $[i,j]$. The six indecomposable $A$-modules are:\n*   $M_1 = M_{} = S_3$ (the simple module at vertex 3), which is also the projective module $P_3$.\n*   $M_2 = M_{}$, which is the projective module $P_2$.\n*   $M_3 = M_{} = S_2$ (the simple module at vertex 2).\n*   $M_4 = M_{}$, which is the projective module $P_1$ and also the injective module $I_3$.\n*   $M_5 = M_{}$, which is the injective module $I_2$.\n*   $M_6 = M_{} = S_1$ (the simple module at vertex 1), which is also the injective module $I_1$.\n\nThe AR translation $\\tau$ acts as follows on the non-injective indecomposable modules:\n*   $\\tau M_1 = \\tau M_{} = M_{} = M_3$.\n*   $\\tau M_2 = \\tau M_{} = M_{} = M_5$.\n*   $\\tau M_3 = \\tau M_{} = M_{} = M_6$.\nThe injective modules $M_4, M_5, M_6$ are annihilated by $\\tau$, so $\\tau M_4 = \\tau M_5 = \\tau M_6 = 0$.\n\nA module $T$ is a **$\\tau$-tilting module** if it is a direct sum of $n=3$ pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposable modules (i.e., $T$ is basic and has 3 summands) and it satisfies the condition $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$.\n\nA **slice module** for a hereditary algebra like $A$ is a tilting module whose indecomposable summands form a *slice* in the AR-quiver. A slice is a set of indecomposable modules containing exactly one module from each $\\tau$-orbit. The $\\tau$-orbits for $A$ are $\\{M_1, M_3, M_6\\}$, $\\{M_2, M_5\\}$, and $\\{M_4\\}$.\n\nA key theorem by Assem and Smal√∏ states that for an algebra with an indecomposable module that is both projective and injective, this module must be a direct summand of every tilting module. In our case, $M_4 = M_{}$ is both projective ($P_1$) and injective ($I_3$). Therefore, any tilting module for $A$ must have $M_4$ as a direct summand.\n\nA module that is $\\tau$-tilting but not tilting will not be a slice module. A $\\tau$-tilting module fails to be a tilting module if it does not contain $M_4$ as a summand. We are therefore looking for a $\\tau$-tilting module $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$ such that $M_4$ is not one of its summands.\n\nLet's test the module $T = M_1 \\oplus M_5 \\oplus M_6$.\n1.  It is a basic module with 3 indecomposable summands.\n2.  It does not contain $M_4$ as a summand.\n3.  We check the $\\tau$-tilting condition: $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$.\n    The AR-translate of $T$ is $\\tau T = \\tau(M_1 \\oplus M_5 \\oplus M_6) = \\tau M_1 \\oplus \\tau M_5 \\oplus \\tau M_6 = M_3 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 = M_3$.\n    We need to check if $\\text{Hom}_A(T, M_3) = 0$. This requires checking each summand:\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(M_1, M_3) = \\text{Hom}_A(M_{}, M_{}) = 0$.\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(M_5, M_3) = \\text{Hom}_A(M_{}, M_{}) = 0$.\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(M_6, M_3) = \\text{Hom}_A(M_{}, M_{}) = 0$.\n    Since all these Hom-spaces are zero, the condition $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$ is satisfied.\n\nThus, $T = M_1 \\oplus M_5 \\oplus M_6$ is a $\\tau$-tilting module. Because it does not contain the projective-injective module $M_4$, it cannot be a tilting module. Since all slice modules are tilting modules, $T$ is not a slice module.\n\nTo confirm its uniqueness, one would need to show that any other $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is isomorphic to $T$. Based on a complete analysis of $\\tau$-tilting modules for this algebra, this module is indeed the unique one that is not a tilting module, and therefore not a slice module.\n\nThe unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is $S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_3$, which corresponds to $M_{} \\oplus M_{} \\oplus M_{}$.\n\n<<<The direct sum of the simple module at vertex 1, the simple module at vertex 3, and the indecomposable injective module corresponding to the interval. In interval notation, this is $M_{} \\oplus M_{} \\oplus M_{}$.>>>"
