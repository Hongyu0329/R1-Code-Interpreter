    "The initial search provided general information about cambré derrière and some characteristics of the Balanchine method, but it did not directly compare the Vaganova and Balanchine techniques for this specific step. I need to find more specific information that highlights the differences between the two methods to answer the user's question accurately. The next steps should focus on finding this direct comparison.The search results provide a good general overview of the differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods. I've learned that Vaganova emphasizes precision, a codified system, and expressive upper body movements with a stable torso, while Balanchine focuses on speed, fluidity, and creating long lines, sometimes by altering the traditional alignment of the hips and torso. Specifically regarding movements that could relate to a cambré derrière, one source mentioned that in a Balanchine arabesque, the hip of the working leg is allowed to lift, and the side arm is pressed back to create a longer line. Another source detailed the Vaganova fifth port de bras, which involves a cambré back with specific head and arm movements. However, a direct comparison of the *cambré derrière* itself is still missing. I need to find more specific information that directly contrasts how each method executes this particular step, paying attention to the listed answer choices.The previous searches have provided a solid foundation on the general differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods. I've gathered that Vaganova emphasizes a stable, square torso and specific, expressive upper body and head movements, while Balanchine is known for speed, athleticism, and creating long lines, which can involve an open hip in arabesque.\n\nSpecifically, I found details on the Vaganova fifth port de bras, which includes a cambré back with coordinated arm and head movements. For Balanchine, a key characteristic that has been repeatedly mentioned is the open hip in arabesque to create the illusion of a higher leg line. This is a significant deviation from the classical, squared-off hip placement.\n\nHowever, I still lack a direct, explicit comparison of the *cambré derrière* in both methods. While the open hip in a Balanchine arabesque is a strong clue, I need to confirm if this principle is also applied in a cambré derrière and if there are other distinguishing features related to the answer choices (arm placement, speed, degree of backbend, head placement). I will conduct one more search to try and find a direct comparison or a more detailed description of the Balanchine cambré derrière.The research has consistently highlighted key differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods. For Vaganova, there is a strong emphasis on a stable and square torso, with specific and expressive use of the head and arms. The backbend in a Vaganova cambré is described as originating from the upper back, with the spine elongating upwards and outwards.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is characterized by speed, athleticism, and the creation of long, extended lines. A defining feature of the Balanchine style, mentioned in multiple sources, is the use of an open hip, particularly in arabesque, to create the illusion of a higher leg line. This involves breaking the traditional \"box\" of the hips and shoulders. One source explicitly states that in Balanchine's arabesque, the working shoulder and hip are more open. Another source mentions \"swaying hips\" as a characteristic of the Balanchine style. This alteration of the hip placement is a significant departure from the Vaganova method's insistence on a square torso.\n\nWhile a direct comparison of the *cambré derrière* itself remains somewhat elusive, the consistent emphasis on the open hip in Balanchine's arabesque strongly suggests that this principle would extend to similar backward-bending movements like the cambré derrière, as both aim to create an extended line to the back. The other answer choices are less consistently supported by the search results as the *primary* distinction. Therefore, the most significant and repeatedly cited difference that would apply to a cambré derrière is the placement of the hip.\n\nI believe I have sufficient information to answer the question.\n\nA key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a square and stable torso. The backbend, or cambré, should originate from the upper and middle back, with the spine elongating upwards and outwards while the hips remain aligned and do not tilt. This method prioritizes a clean, classical line with a focus on the expressiveness of the upper body and arms, coordinated with specific head movements.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is renowned for its emphasis on creating long, extended lines, speed, and a more athletic quality of movement. A signature characteristic of the Balanchine style is the use of an open hip, particularly in arabesques, to create the illusion of a higher leg line. This technique involves allowing the hip of the working leg to lift, which breaks the traditional \"box\" of the squared shoulders and hips. This principle of opening the hip to lengthen the line is a notable departure from the Vaganova technique and would apply to movements like the cambré derrière. The style is also sometimes characterized by \"swaying hips\" and a more dynamic, three-dimensional spiral from the waist up.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement, speed, and head position do differ between the two methods, the fundamental approach to hip placement in backward-bending movements is a more defining and consistently cited difference.\n\n<<<B>>>"
