    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate. This reaction involves the treatment of 2-chlorocyclohexanone with a base, such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol, which leads to a contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is a metric used to quantify the complexity of a molecule based on information theory, considering the chemical microenvironment of each atom. This calculation is additive and sensitive to factors like stereochemistry, heteroatoms, and molecular symmetry.\n\nWhile the Böttcher score can be determined using a web-based calculator provided by the Forli Lab at Scripps, a pre-calculated value for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is not readily available in the searched literature. The SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1, which is required for such a calculation.\n\nWithout direct access to the Böttcher Score calculator, the final numerical value for the molecular complexity cannot be provided."
