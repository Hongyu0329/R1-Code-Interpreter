    "To find the number that should be filled in the parentheses in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, we need to identify the pattern governing the series.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between consecutive terms:\n*   From 2 to 11: 11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n*   From 11 to 23: 23 = 11 * 2 + 1\n*   From 23 to 51: 51 = 23 * 2 + 5\n*   From 51 to 119: 119 = 51 * 2 + 17\n\nThis pattern can be described as \"multiply the previous number by 2 and add a certain value.\" Let's examine the sequence of these added values: 7, 1, 5, 17. At first glance, this sequence doesn't seem to have a simple pattern.\n\nLet's try another approach. Let's see if there is a pattern involving multiplying by 3 and then subtracting a value.\n*   From 2 to 11: 11 = 3 * 2 + 5\n*   From 11 to 23: 23 = 3 * 11 - 10\n*   From 23 to 51: 51 = 3 * 23 - 18\n*   From 51 to 119: 119 = 3 * 51 - 34\n\nNow, let's look at the sequence of the numbers being subtracted: 10, 18, 34. Let's find the difference between these numbers:\n*   18 - 10 = 8\n*   34 - 18 = 16\n\nThe difference is doubling each time (8, 16). The next difference should be 16 * 2 = 32. Therefore, the next number to be subtracted would be 34 + 32 = 66.\n\nUsing this pattern, we can find the next term in the main sequence:\nNext term = 3 * 119 - 66\nNext term = 357 - 66\nNext term = 291\n\nThus, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
