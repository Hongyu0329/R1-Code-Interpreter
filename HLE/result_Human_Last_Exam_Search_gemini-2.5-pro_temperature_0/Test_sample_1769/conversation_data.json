    "Without the Norse invasions and subsequent linguistic influence, the Modern English word for a female sibling would likely be \"suster\" or \"swuster.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this conclusion is reached:\n\n*   **Old English Origin:** The native Anglo-Saxon word for sister was \"sweostor\" (with variations like *swuster*). This word, like \"brother\" (*brōðor*), \"mother\" (*mōdor*), and \"father\" (*fæder*), was part of the original Germanic vocabulary of the Anglo-Saxons.\n\n*   **Norse Influence:** During the Viking Age, speakers of Old Norse, who said \"systir,\" settled in large parts of England. The close contact and intermingling of the two languages led to Old Norse \"systir\" influencing and eventually replacing the native \"sweostor.\" The modern form \"sister\" clearly shows the \"i\" vowel from the Old Norse \"systir\" rather than the \"eo\" or \"u\" of the Old English \"sweostor.\"\n\n*   **Hypothetical Development:** If \"sweostor\" had developed naturally without Norse influence, it would have followed the typical sound changes that occurred between Old and Modern English. The initial \"sw-\" would likely have been lost or simplified, and the vowels would have shifted. Looking at the Middle English forms that were not influenced by Norse, such as \"suster,\" gives a strong indication of the word's natural trajectory.\n\n*   **Comparative Evidence:** This is further supported by looking at related West Germanic languages that did not have the same level of Norse influence. For example, the word for sister is \"zuster\" in Dutch and \"Schwester\" in German, both of which evolved from the same Proto-Germanic root (*swestēr*) as the Old English \"sweostor.\"\n\nTherefore, had the Anglo-Saxons never interacted with the Norse, the word \"sweostor\" would have most likely evolved into \"suster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
