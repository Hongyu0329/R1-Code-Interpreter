    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **What is the great icosahedron?** The great icosahedron is a non-convex regular polyhedron with 20 intersecting triangular faces.\n\n2.  **What is the outer hull of the great icosahedron?** The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n3.  **What is a regular icosahedron?** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Its faces are 20 equilateral triangles.\n\n4.  **What does it mean to triangulate the outer hull?** The outer hull is the surface of the regular icosahedron. A triangulation of a surface is a division of that surface into a set of triangles. Since the faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles, the icosahedron itself is a triangulation of its surface.\n\n5.  **What is the minimal number of visible triangles from the outside?** This is asking for the number of triangles on the surface of the convex hull. Since the convex hull is a regular icosahedron, and a regular icosahedron is made up of 20 triangular faces, the number of visible triangles is 20.\n\nThe search results also mention more complex triangulations, such as \"acute triangulations\", which seek to find the minimum number of *acute* triangles needed to tile the surface. For instance, one result states that the surface of a regular icosahedron can be triangulated with 8 non-obtuse triangles or 12 acute triangles, and that these are the smallest possible numbers for those specific types of triangulations. However, the question asks for the *minimal* number of triangles for a general triangulation, not a specific type like an acute one. The most straightforward and minimal triangulation is the one defined by the faces of the icosahedron itself.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is the number of faces on its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron. That number is 20.The outer hull, or convex hull, of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n\nThe process of triangulating a surface involves dividing it into a set of triangles. Since the surface of a regular icosahedron is already composed of 20 equilateral triangles, the minimal triangulation is the set of its own faces. Therefore, the number of visible triangles from the outside is simply the number of faces on the regular icosahedron.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
