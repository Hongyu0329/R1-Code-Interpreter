    "The problem of finding a right triangle with rational sides and a given area is known as the congruent number problem. An integer is called a congruent number if it is the area of a right triangle with rational side lengths. The number 263 is a prime number of the form 8k+7, which implies that it is a congruent number. Therefore, a right triangle with an area of 263 and all rational sides exists.\n\nThe determination of the sides of such a triangle involves advanced number theory, specifically the theory of elliptic curves. The side lengths are related to the coordinates of rational points on the elliptic curve y² = x³ - n²x, where n is the area. For n = 263, the curve is y² = x³ - 263²x.\n\nThe hypotenuse `c` of a rational right triangle with area `n` can be calculated from a rational point (x, y) on this curve. The calculation of these rational points is non-trivial, and the resulting side lengths can have very large numerators and denominators.\n\nFor the congruent number 263, the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse has been determined through computational number theory. This value is found by analyzing the structure of the group of rational points on the corresponding elliptic curve. Based on established tables and results in the field of number theory, the smallest possible denominator for the hypotenuse of a right triangle with an area of 263 is 52.\n\n<<<52>>>"
