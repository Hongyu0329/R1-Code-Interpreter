    "Let the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$. We can write this polynomial as a sum of its terms: $P(x) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$. The problem asks for the value of the sum of the squares of the coefficients, which is $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nA useful mathematical identity states that the sum of the squares of the coefficients of a polynomial $P(x)$ is equal to the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$. The constant term of a polynomial is the coefficient of the $x^0$ term.\n\nLet's first determine $P(x^{-1})$:\n$P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+(x^{-1})^{3^i}+(x^{-1})^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ (x^{-1})^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n$P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n\nNow, we form the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\right] \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\right]$\n\nWe can combine the products:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left[ \\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\right]$\n\nTo find the constant term of this entire product, we can find the constant term of each individual factor in the product and then multiply these constant terms together. Let's focus on the $i$-th factor:\n$F_i(x) = \\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n\nThe constant term of $F_i(x)$ is found by multiplying terms from the first parenthesis with terms from the second parenthesis whose exponents sum to zero.\nThe constant term is:\n$(1 \\cdot 1) + (x^{3^i} \\cdot x^{-3^i}) + (x^{2\\cdot 3^i} \\cdot x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) + (x^{3\\cdot 3^i} \\cdot x^{-3\\cdot 3^i})$\n$= 1 + x^0 + x^0 + x^0$\n$= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$\n\nEach of the factors in the product for $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ has a constant term of 4. Since the product runs from $i=0$ to $i=19$, there are 20 such factors.\n\nTherefore, the constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ is the product of the constant terms of each of the 20 factors:\nConstant Term = $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4 = 4^{20}$\n\nThis constant term is equal to the desired sum of the squares of the coefficients.\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = 4^{20}$\n\nWe can also express this as a power of 2:\n$4^{20} = (2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$\n\n<<<4^{20}>>>"
