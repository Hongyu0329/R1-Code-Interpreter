    "To determine the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure, we first need to find the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates of the curve.\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n\n**Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n*   The range of $x$ is $[\\cos(\\pi), \\cos(0)] = [-1, 1]$.\n*   The range of $y$ is $[0, \\sin(\\pi/2)] =$.\nThis part of the curve is the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n\n**Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n*   The range of $x$ is $[\\cos(\\pi), \\cos(2\\pi)] = [-1, 1]$.\n*   The range of $y$ is $[5\\sin(3\\pi/2), 0) = [-5, 0)$.\nThis part of the curve is the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n\n**Overall Dimensions of the Figure**\nTo find the full extent of the figure, we combine the ranges from both parts:\n*   **Total x-range:** The union of $[-1, 1]$ and $[-1, 1]$ is $[-1, 1]$.
