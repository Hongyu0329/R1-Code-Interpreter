    "When viewed from above, the buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter L.\n\nThe two schools are located in adjacent buildings on Via Benedetto Croce. The Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti is at numbers 32 and 34, while the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" is at number 36. The buildings are connected and share an internal courtyard. This arrangement, with one building forming the vertical line and the other forming the horizontal base, creates the distinct shape of the letter L when seen from a satellite perspective.\n\n<<<L>>>"
