To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia.

    "To solve this problem with the highest memory efficiency, we should avoid storing the entire input string. The most effective approach is to read the input character by character and use a counting sort methodology. We only need to count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1.  Create an array of four counters, one for each possible number. Since the count for any number can exceed 255 (the maximum for a `char`), but will be less than 65,535, the `unsigned short` data type (2 bytes) is the most memory-efficient choice for these counters.\n2.  Read the input one character at a time using `getchar()`. This avoids allocating a large buffer (e.g., `char s[1001]`) for the input string. The variable for `getchar()` must be an `int` to handle the special `EOF` value.\n3.  Increment the appropriate counter when a digit '1' through '4' is read.\n4.  After counting, print the numbers in sorted order. To handle the '+' separators correctly without using an extra flag variable (which would consume more memory), a special printing logic is used:\n    *   Find the smallest number that appeared in the input.\n    *   Print it once.\n    *   Decrement its count.\n    *   Loop through all the numbers (1 to 4) and print the remaining occurrences, always prepending a '+' character.\n\nThis approach minimizes memory usage by using the smallest possible data types for each variable and processing the input as a stream.\n\n### Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program solves the Xenia and the Sum problem with a focus on\n * minimal memory usage. It reads the sum character by character,\n * counts the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, 4), and then\n * prints the sorted sum.\n */\nint main() {\n    // counters for numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Max count is ~500 for a 1000-char string.\n    // `unsigned short` (2 bytes) is the most memory-efficient type that can hold this count.\n    // Memory: 4 * sizeof(unsigned short) = 8 bytes.\n    unsigned short counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // Variable to hold the character from getchar(). It must be an `int` to\n    // correctly handle the EOF (End-Of-File) value.\n    // Memory: sizeof(int) = 4 bytes.\n    int c;\n\n    // Read input character by character and update counts.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            // '1' -> index 0, '2' -> index 1, etc.\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Loop variable for the counts array (iterates 0-3). `char` is sufficient.\n    // Memory: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // Find the first number that actually appears in the sum.\n    while (i < 4 && counts[i] == 0) {\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // Check if any number was found (handles empty or invalid input).\n    if (i < 4) {\n        // Print the first number without a preceding '+'.\n        putchar(i + '1');\n        // Decrement its count as it has been printed.\n        counts[i]--;\n\n        // Loop variable for printing remaining numbers. Needs to hold up to ~500.\n        // `unsigned short` is the most efficient choice.\n        // Memory: sizeof(unsigned short) = 2 bytes.\n        unsigned short j;\n\n        // Loop through all number types (from the current `i` onwards).\n        for (; i < 4; i++) {\n            // Print the remaining counts for each number.\n            for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n                putchar('+');\n                putchar(i + '1');\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print a final newline for clean output.\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the sizes of all variables declared in the `main` function. Assuming a standard system where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, `sizeof(unsigned short)` is 2 bytes, and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte:\n\n*   `unsigned short counts[4]`: 4 * 2 bytes = 8 bytes\n*   `int c`: 4 bytes\n*   `char i`: 1 byte\n*   `unsigned short j`: 2 bytes\n\n**Total Memory (m)** = 8 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 15 bytes.\n\n<<<15>>>"
