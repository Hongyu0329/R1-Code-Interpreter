    "The symmetry group for the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₁. This notation indicates a cyclic group of order 1, which means the packing has no rotational symmetry other than the trivial rotation of 360 degrees.\n\nThis information is based on the comprehensive database of circle packings compiled by Eckard Specht. For N=1135, the packing configuration is listed with a C₁ symmetry group.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
