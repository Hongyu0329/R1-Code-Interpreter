In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the expression:

`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2] ϕ(τ, x)`

where:
*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.
*   `τ` is the imaginary time coordinate.
*   `x` represents the `d` spatial coordinates.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.
*   `-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2` is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.

This expression corresponds to twice the kinetic and mass term of the Euclidean action for the scalar field.
