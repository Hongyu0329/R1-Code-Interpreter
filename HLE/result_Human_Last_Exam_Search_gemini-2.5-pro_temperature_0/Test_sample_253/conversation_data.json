    "Following the application of cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 successive iterations starting from a single cell in state 1, the resulting binary pattern is **11111011011101011**.\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton that determines the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) based on its own state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The rule set is as follows:\n\n| Current Neighbor Pattern | New State for Center Cell |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nThe name \"Rule 110\" is derived from the binary representation of the output states, 01101110, which is equivalent to the decimal number 110.\n\nStarting with an initial state of a single '1' surrounded by '0's, the pattern evolves with each iteration. The evolution of the pattern up to the 20th iteration is as follows:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** 1\n*   **Generation 1:** 11\n*   **Generation 2:** 111\n*   **Generation 3:** 1101\n*   **Generation 4:** 11111\n*   **Generation 5:** 110001\n*   **Generation 6:** 1110011\n*   **Generation 7:** 11010111\n*   **Generation 8:** 111111101\n*   **Generation 9:** 1100000111\n*   **Generation 10:** 11100011001\n*   **Generation 11:** 110100111011\n*   **Generation 12:** 1111101101111\n*   **Generation 13:** 11000111111001\n*   **Generation 14:** 111001100001011\n*   **Generation 15:** 110101110011111\n*   **Generation 16:** 1111111101100001\n*   **Generation 17:** 1100000011110011\n*   **Generation 18:** 1110000110010111\n*   **Generation 19:** 11010011101111001\n*   **Generation 20:** 11111011011101011\n\nThis complex and seemingly chaotic behavior emerging from simple rules is a characteristic of \"Class 4\" automata, to which Rule 110 belongs. Notably, Rule 110 has been proven to be Turing complete, meaning it is capable of universal computation.\n\n<<<11111011011101011>>>"
