The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single number but is calculated by summing the primitives for each atom in a molecule. For a hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row atom like carbon or oxygen, there are 32 primitive Gaussians. Therefore, the total number for a molecule is determined by its atomic composition.
