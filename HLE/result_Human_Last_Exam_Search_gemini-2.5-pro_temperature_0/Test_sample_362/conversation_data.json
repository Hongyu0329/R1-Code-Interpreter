    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. This reaction involves a phosphonium ylide, known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with the carbonyl compound. A key advantage of this method is that the new double bond forms specifically at the location of the original carbonyl group.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It is also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl).\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the pivalaldehyde and the triphenylphosphine group (PPh₃) of the ylide are eliminated, and a new carbon-carbon double bond is formed between the respective carbon atoms.\n\nThe resulting product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The other product of the reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide (O=PPh₃).\n\nRegarding the stereochemistry of the double bond, Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides typically yield the (Z)-alkene as the major product. The ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, has an alkyl group attached to the ylidic carbon, classifying it as an unstabilized ylide. Therefore, the (Z)-isomer, where the high-priority groups are on the same side of the double bond, is expected to be the predominant product under standard conditions.\n\n<<<The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**, with triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct. The reaction is expected to favor the formation of the (Z)-isomer.>>>"
