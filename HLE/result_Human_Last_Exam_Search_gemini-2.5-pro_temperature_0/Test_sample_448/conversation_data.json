    "### Radon Identified as Earth's Rarest Noble Gas in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was radon (Rn). Its extreme scarcity is a direct consequence of its radioactivity and short half-life. Unlike the other noble gases, radon has no stable isotopes, and its most long-lived isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.82 days. This means that radon decays quickly after it is formed, preventing it from accumulating in any significant quantity.\n\nTerrestrial matter, for the purposes of this analysis, is considered to be the Earth's atmosphere, crust, and mantle, excluding the core. The abundance of noble gases varies significantly across these reservoirs. While argon is the most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere and crust, the overall rarity of each noble gas must be assessed by considering its total inventory across all three components of terrestrial matter.\n\nThe primary source of radon on Earth is the radioactive decay of radium-226, which is itself a decay product of uranium-238. Since uranium is found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's crust and mantle, radon is constantly being generated. However, its rapid decay ensures that its steady-state concentration remains exceptionally low.\n\nEstimates of the abundance of noble gases in the Earth's major reservoirs around the year 2002, with a key reference being the work of Ozima and Podosek in \"Noble Gas Geochemistry\" (2002), indicate the following:\n\n*   **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere contains the majority of the Earth's inventory of non-radiogenic noble gases. The total masses of noble gases in the atmosphere are approximately: Argon (6.6 x 10¹⁹ g), Neon (6.5 x 10¹⁶ g), Krypton (1.7 x 10¹⁶ g), Helium (3.7 x 10¹⁵ g), and Xenon (2.0 x 10¹⁵ g). The amount of radon in the atmosphere is minuscule in comparison.\n*   **Crust:** The Earth's crust contains noble gases produced by radioactive decay (radiogenic) and those trapped during its formation. While argon is the most abundant noble gas in the crust, the concentration of radon is exceedingly low, estimated to be around 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram.\n*   **Mantle:** The mantle is the largest terrestrial reservoir by mass. While it contains primordial noble gases trapped during Earth's formation and radiogenic isotopes produced by the decay of elements like potassium, uranium, and thorium, the concentration of the short-lived radon is negligible compared to other noble gases.\n\nDue to its extremely short half-life, the total amount of radon present in the atmosphere, crust, and mantle at any given moment is infinitesimal compared to the other noble gases. Even though it is continuously produced, it decays just as rapidly, leading to its status as the rarest noble gas. Therefore, when considering the total terrestrial matter, radon's contribution as a percentage is by far the lowest among all noble gases.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
