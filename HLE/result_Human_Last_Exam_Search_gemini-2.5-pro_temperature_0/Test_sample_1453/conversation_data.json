    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are crucial as they form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, which largely dictates the oligomeric state.\n\nFirst, let's identify the hydrophobic residues in the sequence: Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W). The pattern of a coiled-coil is typically `(HPPHPPP)n`, where 'H' is a hydrophobic residue and 'P' is a polar/charged residue. The 'a' and 'd' positions are usually hydrophobic.\n\nLet's test possible alignments (frames) for the heptad repeat:\n\n1.  **Frame Analysis:** We look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues at positions `a` and `d`, which are separated by two other residues (`a-b-c-d`). The most plausible and consistent hydrophobic core is found when we assign the residues as follows:\n\n    `e f g a b c d`\n    `G E I` **`A Q S L`**\n    `K E I` **`A K S L`**\n    `K E I` **`A W S L`**\n    `K E I` **`A Q S L`**\n    `K G`\n\n    This alignment reveals a consistent pattern for the core positions across the four full heptads:\n    *   **'a' positions:** Alanine (A), Alanine (A), Alanine (A), Alanine (A)\n    *   **'d' positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n\n2.  **Knobs-into-Holes Packing and Oligomeric State:** The identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions influences the packing efficiency and thus the number of helices in the coiled-coil.\n    *   **Dimers** are commonly formed by sequences with Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position.\n    *   **Tetramers** are favored when Leucine (L) is at the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) is at the 'd' position.\n    *   **Trimers** are often formed when Isoleucine or Leucine are at both 'a' and 'd' positions. The presence of polar residues in the core can also favor trimers.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the `a=A, d=L` Core:** In our sequence, we have Alanine (A) at all 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at all 'd' positions.\n    *   Alanine is a small hydrophobic residue, while Leucine is larger.\n    *   In a dimeric coiled-coil, the 'a' positions of the two helices pack against each other, and the 'd' positions pack against each other. An interface composed solely of small Alanine residues (`a-a` packing) would be inefficient and would likely create a destabilizing cavity in the hydrophobic core.\n    *   In a trimeric coiled-coil, the packing arrangement is different; the 'a' position of one helix packs into a \"hole\" created by the 'a' and 'd' positions of the adjacent helix. This staggered arrangement can more efficiently accommodate a combination of small (Alanine) and large (Leucine) residues. The small \"knob\" of Alanine can fit neatly into the hole created by its neighbors, leading to better packing efficiency than in a dimer.\n\nGiven that the `a=A, d=L` pattern would lead to poor packing as a dimer, and it does not fit the canonical pattern for a tetramer, the most stable and energetically favorable oligomeric state would be a trimer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
