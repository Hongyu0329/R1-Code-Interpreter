    "In the semidihedral group of size 512, there are 9 power subgroups.\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be expressed as H = G<sup>m</sup> = {g<sup>m</sup> | g ∈ G} for some integer m. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form for the semidihedral group of order 512.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512 (which is 2<sup>9</sup>) can be denoted as SD<sub>512</sub>. It has the following presentation:\nSD<sub>512</sub> = < a, b | a<sup>256</sup> = 1, b<sup>2</sup> = 1, bab = a<sup>127</sup> >\n\nThe set of all power subgroups is { G<sup>m</sup> | m ∈ ℤ }. We can analyze these subgroups:\n\n1.  **When m is an odd number:** For any 2-group (a group where every element's order is a power of 2), the mapping x ↦ x<sup>m</sup> is a bijection when m is odd. This means that every element of the group is an m-th power of some element, and thus G<sup>m</sup> = G. So, for any odd m, we get the group G itself.\n\n2.  **When m is an even number:** Let m = 2<sup>k</sup>d, where d is odd and k ≥ 1. The set of m-th powers can be calculated as G<sup>m</sup> = (G<sup>2<sup>k</sup></sup>)<sup>d</sup>. Since G<sup>2<sup>k</sup></sup> is also a 2-group, raising its elements to an odd power d results in a bijection, as explained above. Therefore, (G<sup>2<sup>k</sup></sup>)<sup>d</sup> = G<sup>2<sup>k</sup></sup>. This shows that the set of power subgroups is determined by the powers of 2.\n\nWe now identify the distinct power subgroups by examining G<sup>2<sup>k</sup></sup> for k ≥ 0:\n*   **k=0:** G<sup>1</sup> = G = SD<sub>512</sub>. This is the entire group of order 512.\n*   **k=1:** G<sup>2</sup> = {g<sup>2</sup> | g ∈ G}. The squares of elements of the form a<sup>i</sup> are a<sup>2i</sup>, and the squares of elements of the form a<sup>i</sup>b are a<sup>128i</sup>. The union of these sets forms the cyclic subgroup <a<sup>2</sup>>, which has order 128.\n*   **k=2:** G<sup>4</sup> = {g<sup>4</sup> | g ∈ G}. This is the subgroup <a<sup>4</sup>>, with order 64.\n*   **k=3:** G<sup>8</sup> = <a<sup>8</sup>>, with order 32.\n*   **k=4:** G<sup>16</sup> = <a<sup>16</sup>>, with order 16.\n*   **k=5:** G<sup>32</sup> = <a<sup>32</sup>>, with order 8.\n*   **k=6:** G<sup>64</sup> = <a<sup>64</sup>>, with order 4.\n*   **k=7:** G<sup>128</sup> = <a<sup>128</sup>>, with order 2. This subgroup is the center of SD<sub>512</sub>.\n*   **k=8:** G<sup>256</sup>. The exponent of SD<sub>512</sub> is 256, meaning g<sup>256</sup> = 1 for all g in the group. Thus, G<sup>256</sup> is the trivial subgroup {1}.\n\nThese are all the distinct power subgroups. Counting them, we have the group G itself, plus 8 other subgroups (including the trivial one), for a total of 9.\n\nThe power subgroups are:\n1.  SD<sub>512</sub>\n2.  <a<sup>2</sup>>\n3.  <a<sup>4</sup>>\n4.  <a<sup>8</sup>>\n5.  <a<sup>16</sup>>\n6.  <a<sup>32</sup>>\n7.  <a<sup>64</sup>>\n8.  <a<sup>128</sup>>\n9.  {1}\n\n<<<9>>>"
