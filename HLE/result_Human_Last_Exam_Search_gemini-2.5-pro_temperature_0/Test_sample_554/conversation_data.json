    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 18 fluorine atoms.\n\nThis is based on the structure of the original nanocar developed at Rice University in 2005. The term \"perfluoro\" or \"perfluorocarbon\" indicates a compound where all hydrogen atoms on a hydrocarbon have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nThe chassis of the first nanocar is the component that would be fluorinated. This H-shaped chassis consists of a central benzene ring connected to four phenylene \"axles\" by ethynyl groups. A detailed count of the hydrogen atoms on this chassis reveals:\n*   **Central Ring:** The benzene ring is substituted at four positions, leaving 2 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Axle Groups:** Each of the four phenylene groups that form the axles has 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the chassis is 2 + (4 x 4) = 18. In a perfluorinated version, these 18 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by 18 fluorine atoms. The fullerene \"wheels\" of the nanocar are composed entirely of carbon and thus have no hydrogens to be replaced.\n\n<<<18>>>"
