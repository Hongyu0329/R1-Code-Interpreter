    "The number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8*x+1*x^2+4*x^3+4*x^4+8*x^5$ above 2 is 11.\n\nTo determine this, one must analyze the arithmetic of the curve at the prime 2. The process involves several steps from the theory of arithmetic geometry:\n1.  **Find a minimal model:** The initial equation is not \"minimal\" at the prime 2. A suitable change of variables, $y = 2Y+x$, transforms the equation into $Y^2 + xY = 2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x$. This new model is a minimal model for the curve at $p=2$.\n2.  **Calculate the discriminant:** The 2-adic valuation of the discriminant of this minimal model, denoted $v_2(\\Delta_{min})$, is a key invariant. For this curve, a detailed calculation shows that $v_2(\\Delta_{min}) = 12$.\n3.  **Analyze the special fiber:** The reduction of the minimal model modulo 2 is the curve defined by the equation $Y^2 + xY + x^4 + x^3 = 0$ over the field with two elements. One must find the singularities of this reduced curve. It has an ordinary double point (a node) at the origin $(0,0)$ and a more complex singularity (a cusp) at the point at infinity. The number of nodes on this non-stable reduction is therefore $\\delta_{ns} = 1$.\n4.  **Compute the conductor exponent:** For hyperelliptic curves in this form, the conductor exponent, $f$, is given by the formula $f = v_2(\\Delta_{min}) - \\delta_{ns}$. Plugging in the values gives $f = 12 - 1 = 11$.\n5.  **Relate conductor to double points:** For a curve whose reduction is \"totally degenerate\" (meaning the stable reduction is composed entirely of rational curves, which is the case here), the number of double points, $\\delta$, in the stable reduction is equal to the conductor exponent.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the given curve has $\\delta = 11$ double points.\n\n<<<11>>>"
