    "To solve the problem, we follow a step-by-step process to identify the group G, its Schur multiplier A, and then the number of proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 1: Identifying the group G**\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations on the set $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$. By analyzing the generators or using a computational algebra system, the group $G$ can be identified. The generators are:\n*   $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n*   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n*   $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\nThese generators produce the sporadic simple group known as the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. This group has an order of 95,040.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Schur Multiplier A**\n\nThe Schur multiplier of a group $G$, denoted $M(G)$, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. For the Mathieu group $M_{12}$, the Schur multiplier is well-documented in the mathematical literature. The Schur multiplier of $M_{12}$ is the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as $C_2$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Therefore, the abelian group $A$ is isomorphic to $C_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the Proper Subgroups of A up to Isomorphism**\n\nThe group $A$ is isomorphic to $C_2$. A proper subgroup of a group is any subgroup except the group itself. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. Since $C_2$ has order 2, its subgroups can only have orders 1 or 2.\n\nThe subgroups of $C_2$ are:\n1.  The trivial subgroup, containing only the identity element. This subgroup has order 1.\n2.  The group $C_2$ itself, which has order 2.\n\nThe only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup. All trivial groups are isomorphic to each other (they are all the cyclic group of order 1, $C_1$). Therefore, there is only one proper subgroup of $A$ up to isomorphism.\n\nThe number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
