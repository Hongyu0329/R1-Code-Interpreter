    "### Opened Single-Dose Ampules Must Be Used Immediately and Cannot Be Stored\n\nAccording to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> guidelines, a single-dose ampule must be used immediately after it is opened, and it cannot be stored for any period. This is because once an ampule is broken open, it becomes an open system that cannot be resealed, creating a high risk of contamination.\n\nThe guidance for single-dose ampules is distinct from that for single-dose vials. While single-dose vials that have been punctured in a sterile environment, such as an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air quality environment, may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, this does not apply to ampules.\n\nTherefore, any unused portion of a medication from a single-dose ampule must be discarded immediately after the initial use, and the ampule should not be stored for future use under any circumstances.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period of time.>>>"
