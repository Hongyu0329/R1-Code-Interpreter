    "The VC dimension of the family of sets definable by the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ over a schema $S$ with $k$ unary predicates is $k$. In this specific case, the schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Analysis of the Logic\n\nThe logic in question, $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, allows for:\n*   **Unary Predicates**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n*   **Existential Quantifiers ($\\exists$)**: Allows for the quantification of variables.\n*   **Conjunction ($\\land$)**: The only permitted logical connective.\n*   **Constants**: True ($\\top$) and False ($\\bot$) are included.\n\nThe logic does not permit universal quantifiers ($\\forall$), disjunction ($\\lor$), or negation ($\\lnot$).\n\n### Definable Sets and Concept Class\n\nThe Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the complexity of a class of sets (a \"concept class\"). In this context, the concepts are the sets of elements from a universe that can be defined by a formula in the given logic with one free variable, say $x$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a typical formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable in this logic. Any such formula can be written in the form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m (\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m))$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since all predicates are unary, each atomic formula is of the form $P_i(z)$, where $z$ is one of the variables $\\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_m\\}$.\n\nWe can separate the conjuncts in $\\psi$ into those that involve $x$ and those that do not:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists \\bar{y} \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_{j_i}(x) \\land \\bigwedge_{k \\in K} P_{l_k}(y_{m_k}) \\right)$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_{j_i}(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\exists \\bar{y} \\bigwedge_{k \\in K} P_{l_k}(y_{m_k}) \\right)$\n\nThe second part of the formula, $\\exists \\bar{y} \\bigwedge_{k \\in K} P_{l_k}(y_{m_k})$, is a sentence (it has no free variables). For any given structure (a universe of elements and interpretations for the predicates), this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If the sentence is false, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$, defining the empty set.\n*   If the sentence is true, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to the first part, $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_{j_i}(x)$.\n\nTherefore, any set definable by this logic is either the empty set or a set of elements satisfying a conjunction of some of the unary predicates. The collection of all such definable sets across all possible structures forms our concept class. This class is equivalent to the sets definable by \"monotone monomials\" of the 4 predicates. For any subset of predicates $I \\subseteq \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$, we can form a concept (a definable set) corresponding to the formula $\\bigwedge_{P \\in I} P(x)$.\n\n### Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a concept class of monotone monomials over $n$ variables is known to be $n$. In our case, we have $n=4$ unary predicates, which act as our variables. Thus, the VC dimension is 4.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we must show two things:\n1.  There exists a set of 4 points that can be shattered.\n2.  No set of 5 points can be shattered.\n\n**1. A set of size 4 can be shattered (VC-dim $\\ge 4$)**\n\nLet's construct a universe with a set of 4 points $A = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. We define the properties of these points as follows: $P_j(a_i)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n\n*   $a_1$ satisfies $\\{P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$\n*   $a_2$ satisfies $\\{P_1, P_3, P_4\\}$\n*   $a_3$ satisfies $\\{P_1, P_2, P_4\\}$\n*   $a_4$ satisfies $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$\n\nTo shatter $A$, for any subset $B \\subseteq A$, we must find a formula (a concept) that selects exactly the points in $B$. Let's define the formula based on the points *not* in $B$. Let $J_B = \\{i \\mid a_i \\notin B\\}$. Consider the formula $\\phi_B(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_B} P_j(x)$.\n\nLet's test this:\n*   Take a point $a_k \\in B$. For $\\phi_B(a_k)$ to be true, all predicates $P_j$ with $j \\in J_B$ must be true for $a_k$. By definition of $J_B$, since $a_k \\in B$, $k \\notin J_B$. Our construction states that $P_j(a_k)$ is true for all $j \\neq k$. Since no $j$ in $J_B$ is equal to $k$, $\\phi_B(a_k)$ is true.\n*   Take a point $a_k \\notin B$. For $\\phi_B(a_k)$ to be false, at least one predicate $P_j$ with $j \\in J_B$ must be false for $a_k$. By definition of $J_B$, since $a_k \\notin B$, we have $k \\in J_B$. Our construction states that $P_k(a_k)$ is false. Therefore, $\\phi_B(a_k)$ is false.\n\nThis construction works for any subset $B \\subseteq A$, so the set $A$ is shattered. Since $|A|=4$, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**2. No set of size 5 can be shattered (VC-dim $\\le 4$)**\n\nA well-known result, which is a direct consequence of Sauer's Lemma, states that for a concept class $H$, the VC dimension is bounded by the logarithm of the size of the class: VC(H) $\\le \\log_2(|H|)$.\n\nIn our case, the concepts are generated by taking all possible conjunctions of the 4 predicates. This corresponds to choosing any subset of $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$ to form the conjunction. The number of such subsets is $2^4 = 16$. This is the total number of non-equivalent concepts our logic can define (including $\\top$, which corresponds to the empty conjunction).\n\nSo, $|H| = 16$.\nThe VC dimension is therefore at most $\\log_2(16) = 4$.\n\nSince we have shown that the VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4, it must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
