    "This puzzle requires deciphering a transformation rule from the given input-output pairs and then applying that rule to a new input.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nLet's analyze the changes between the input and output pairs.\n\n**Example A:**\n*   `Input_A`: `'001111,121111,111111'`\n*   `Output_A`: `'201111,101111,111111'`\n\nIf we represent the input and output as grids of numbers:\n\n`Input_A` Grid:\n```\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n`Output_A` Grid:\n```\n2 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThe changes are:\n1.  The number `2` at position `(row=1, col=1)` becomes `0`.\n2.  The number `0` at position `(row=0, col=0)` becomes `2`.\n\nThis suggests the `2` \"moves\" from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`, and its original position is replaced by a `0`.\n\n**Example B:**\n*   `Input_B`: `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'`\n*   `Output_B`: `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`\n\nThe changes are:\n1.  The number `2` at position `(row=3, col=6)` becomes `0`.\n2.  The number `0` at position `(row=2, col=8)` becomes `2`.\n\nHere, the `2` moves from `(3,6)` to `(2,8)`, and its original position is replaced by a `0`.\n\n### Deducing the Movement Rule\n\nLet the position of the `2` be `(r, c)`. The `2` moves to a new position `(r', c')`. The movement can be described by a vector `(dr, dc)` where `dr = r' - r` and `dc = c' - c`.\n\n*   In Example A: The move is from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`. The movement vector is `(dr, dc) = (0-1, 0-1) = (-1, -1)`.\n*   In Example B: The move is from `(3,6)` to `(2,8)`. The movement vector is `(dr, dc) = (2-3, 8-6) = (-1, +2)`.\n\nWe can observe a pattern:\n1.  The change in row `dr` is always **-1**. The `2` always moves one row up.\n2.  The change in column `dc` varies. Let's find the rule for `dc`.\n\nLet's hypothesize that `dc` depends on the content of the row where the `2` is located. Specifically, let's examine the numbers to the left of the `2`.\n\n*   **Example A**: The `2` is in row 1: `'121111'`. The characters to the left of `2` are `'1'`. The number of `1`s here is `1`. The calculated `dc` is `-1`.\n*   **Example B**: The `2` is in row 3: `'1111002111111'`. The characters to the left of `2` are `'111100'`. The number of `1`s here is `4`. The calculated `dc` is `+2`.\n\nLet `n1L` be the number of `1`s to the left of `2` in its row.\n*   From A: `n1L = 1` gives `dc = -1`.\n*   From B: `n1L = 4` gives `dc = +2`.\n\nA simple linear relationship that fits both cases is: **`dc = n1L - 2`**.\n*   For A: `dc = 1 - 2 = -1`. (Correct)\n*   For B: `dc = 4 - 2 = 2`. (Correct)\n\n### Applying the Rule to Input_C\n\nNow we apply this discovered rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   `Input_C`: `'000000,011120,111111'`\n\n1.  **Locate the `2`**: The `2` is at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n2.  **Determine the movement**:\n    *   `dr = -1`.\n    *   The row of the `2` is `'011120'`. The substring to the left of `2` is `'0111'`.\n    *   Count the number of `1`s in this substring: `n1L = 3`.\n    *   Calculate `dc`: `dc = n1L - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`.\n3.  **Find the new position**: The new position `(r', c')` is `(r+dr, c+dc) = (1-1, 4+1) = (0, 5)`.\n4.  **Perform the transformation**:\n    *   The value at the original position `(1, 4)` becomes `0`. The second line `'011120'` becomes `'011100'`.\n    *   The value at the new position `(0, 5)` becomes `2`. The first line `'000000'` becomes `'000002'`.\n    *   The third line `'111111'` remains unchanged.\n\nCombining the transformed lines gives the final output.\n\n*   Row 0: `000002`\n*   Row 1: `011100`\n*   Row 2: `111111`\n\nThe value for MISSING is the comma-separated string of these new rows.\n\n`'000002,011100,111111'`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
