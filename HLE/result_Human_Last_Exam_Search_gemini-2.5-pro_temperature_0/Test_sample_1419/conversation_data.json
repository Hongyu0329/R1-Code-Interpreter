    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is given in terms of ε = 4 - d, where d is the dimensionality of space.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling constant u is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -εu + (3/2)u²\n\nThe fixed point u* is found by setting the beta function to zero, β(u*) = 0. This gives:\n\n-εu* + (3/2)(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0, and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Solving for the non-trivial fixed point, we find:\n\nu* = (2/3)ε\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of ε.\n\n<<<u* = (2/3)ε>>>"
