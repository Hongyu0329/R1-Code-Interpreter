    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we first need to analyze the structure of such characters.\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\cdot 3^2) \\times (7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13)$.\nSo, the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nFor $\\chi$ to be a *primitive* character with conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a primitive character modulo its respective prime power $p^a$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\nThis means we need to find the number of possible choices for each primitive component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6. For this to be true, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component character must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  At least one component character must have an order that is a multiple of 2, and at least one must have an order that is a multiple of 3.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Each Component Character\n\nWe will now determine the number of choices for each primitive component character, keeping in mind that its order must divide 6.\n\n*   **Modulo $2^2 = 4$**:\n    The group of Dirichlet characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order 2. There is one non-principal character, which is primitive with conductor 4. Its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\n    - Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (the character of order 2).\n\n*   **Modulo $3^2 = 9$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo 3. The characters modulo 3 have orders dividing $\\phi(3)=2$. Thus, characters modulo 9 with orders 3 or 6 are primitive. Both orders 3 and 6 are divisors of 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    - Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo $7$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. A character is primitive if it is non-principal (order > 1). The possible orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    - Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo $11$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The order of a primitive character must be a divisor of 6 and a divisor of 10, and must be greater than 1. The only common divisor of 6 and 10 greater than 1 is 2.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Total choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo $13$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The order of a primitive character must be a divisor of 6 and a divisor of 12, and must be greater than 1. The divisors of 6 (2, 3, 6) are all divisors of 12.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    - Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 4. Combining the Components\nWe need to find the total number of tuples of these characters such that the lcm of their orders is 6. Let the orders of the chosen characters be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n- $o_4 = 2$.\n- $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n- $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n- $o_{11} = 2$.\n- $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet's check the lcm condition:\n1.  All possible orders for each component are divisors of 6. Therefore, their lcm will also be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The presence of $\\chi_4$ (or $\\chi_{11}$) ensures that the order of the combined character $\\chi$ is a multiple of 2, since $o_4=2$.\n3.  The character $\\chi_9$ must have order 3 or 6, both of which are multiples of 3. This ensures the order of $\\chi$ is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the order of $\\chi$ is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. As the order also divides 6, it must be exactly 6 for any combination of the allowed primitive characters.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
