    "A finite group G is said to contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 if there exists a subset S ⊂ G of size 2 that is product-free and not properly contained in any larger product-free set of G. A set S is product-free if for any elements a, b, c ∈ S (not necessarily distinct), the relation ab = c does not hold.\n\nResearch in group theory has led to the classification of finite groups that contain such small maximal product-free sets. Specifically, the work of M. Giudici and S. Hart, and later C. S. Anabanti and S. Hart, has established the complete list of these groups.\n\nThe finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 4, denoted C₄.\n*   The cyclic group of order 6, denoted C₆.\n*   The dihedral group of order 6, denoted D₆ (which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃).\n\nTherefore, there are exactly three finite groups that possess a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\nIn more detail, for the dihedral group D₆, a maximal product-free set of size 2 can be formed by an element of order 3 and an element of order 2 (a reflection). For the cyclic groups C₄ and C₆, specific maximal product-free sets of size 2 also exist. The classification is exhaustive, meaning no other finite groups have this property.\n\n<<<3>>>"
