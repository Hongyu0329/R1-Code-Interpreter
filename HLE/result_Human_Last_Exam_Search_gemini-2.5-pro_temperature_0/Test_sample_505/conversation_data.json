    "A surface code is a quantum error-correcting code that is a leading candidate for building fault-tolerant quantum computers. In its basic form, a single, continuous patch of surface code without any defects encodes a single logical qubit. However, by introducing \"holes\" or \"punctures\" into the fabric of the surface code, it is possible to encode additional logical qubits within the same area.\n\nThe number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single patch of surface code is directly related to the number of holes it contains. For a planar surface code with *b* closed holes, it can encode *k = b* logical qubits. Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode two logical qubits.\n\nThe term \"patch\" in the context of surface codes typically refers to a distinct, separate area of the code. These patches can be treated as individual modules, each encoding a certain number of logical qubits. To find the total number of logical qubits across multiple patches, one simply adds the number of logical qubits from each patch.\n\nIn this specific case, there are two patches of surface code, and each patch has two holes. Based on the principle that a patch with *b* holes encodes *b* logical qubits, each patch with two holes will encode two logical qubits. Since there are two such identical patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n\nTherefore, two patches of surface code, each with two holes, can encode a total of 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
