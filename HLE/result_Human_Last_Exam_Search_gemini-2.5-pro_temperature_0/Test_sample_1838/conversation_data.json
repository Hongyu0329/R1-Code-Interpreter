    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1, 1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixel coordinates that lie on the line.\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in x and y:\n*   Δx = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   Δy = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nThe slope of the line is m = Δy / Δx = 4 / 10 = 0.4. Since the slope is between 0 and 1, we will increment x by 1 in each step and decide whether to increment y based on a decision parameter.\n\nThe decision parameter `p` is initialized as:\np = 2 * Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\nWe start at the first point (1, 1) and iterate until we reach the last x-coordinate.\n\nThe sequence of pixels generated is as follows:\n1.  (1, 1)\n2.  (2, 1)\n3.  (3, 2)\n4.  (4, 2)\n5.  (5, 3)\n6.  (6, 3)\n7.  (7, 3)\n8.  (8, 4)\n9.  (9, 4)\n10. (10, 5)\n11. (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in the line. The central pixel is the middle one in this sequence, which is the (11 + 1) / 2 = 6th pixel.\n\nThe 6th pixel in the list is (6, 3).\n\nAlternatively, the midpoint of the line segment is ((1+11)/2, (1+5)/2) = (6, 3). Since (6, 3) is one of the pixels generated by the algorithm, it is the central pixel.\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
