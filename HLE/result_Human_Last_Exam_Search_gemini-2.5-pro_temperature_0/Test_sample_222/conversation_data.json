    "To find the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}, we first need to understand the structure of this problem. This is a classic problem in digital signal processing that involves the properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), specifically how the DFT of an interleaved sequence relates to the DFTs of the original sequences.\n\n### 1. Define the Sequences\n\nLet the 8-point sequence be denoted by y(n):\ny(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}\n\nWe are given the 4-point DFTs of the 4-point sequences x(n) and h(n):\n*   X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]\n*   H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]\n\nThe sequence y(n) can be seen as an interleaving of two 4-point sequences:\n*   The even-indexed terms of y(n) form the sequence x(n):  \n    y(2m) = x(m) for m = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n*   The odd-indexed terms of y(n) form the sequence h(n):  \n    y(2m+1) = h(m) for m = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n### 2. Relate the 8-Point DFT to the 4-Point DFTs\n\nLet Y(k) be the 8-point DFT of y(n). The decimation-in-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm provides a direct relationship between Y(k) and the 4-point DFTs X(k) and H(k). The formula is:\n\nY(k) = X(k mod 4) + W₈ᵏ * H(k mod 4)\n\nwhere W₈ᵏ = e^(-j2πk/8) is the 8-point DFT twiddle factor.\n\n### 3. Interpreting \"4-point DFT for the sequence\"\n\nThe question asks for a 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence. This implies a process of downsampling in the frequency domain. The 4-point DFT, let's call it Z(k), is obtained by taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT, Y(k).\n\nZ(k) = Y(2k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThis is equivalent to creating a 4-point sequence z(n) in the time domain by aliasing (folding and adding) the 8-point sequence y(n), where z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4), and then taking its 4-point DFT.\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe will now calculate Z(k) using the formula Z(k) = Y(2k):\n\nZ(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W₈²ᵏ * H(2k mod 4)\n\nNote that W₈²ᵏ = e^(-j2π(2k)/8) = e^(-j2πk/4) = W₄ᵏ. So the formula simplifies to:\n\nZ(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W₄ᵏ * H(2k mod 4)\n\nLet's compute this for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n*   **For k = 0:**\n    Z(0) = X(0) + W₄⁰ * H(0)\n    Z(0) = 1 + (1) * 0 = 1\n\n*   **For k = 1:**\n    Z(1) = X(2) + W₄¹ * H(2)\n    Z(1) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j\n\n*   **For k = 2:**\n    Z(2) = X(4 mod 4) + W₄² * H(4 mod 4) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0)\n    Z(2) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1\n\n*   **For k = 3:**\n    Z(3) = X(6 mod 4) + W₄³ * H(6 mod 4) = X(2) + (j) * H(2)\n    Z(3) = -1 + (j) * 1 = -1 + j\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is the sequence Z(k) = {Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)}.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
