    "It appears the question combines two distinct references made by Jorge Luis Borges about two different authors and their works.\n\nThe description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" refers to the Uruguayan writer **Juan Carlos Onetti**. The influence of William Faulkner on Onetti's work is widely recognized by literary critics. Borges himself, through his translation of Faulkner's *The Wild Palms*, is credited with facilitating the assimilation of Faulkner's style by a new generation of Latin American writers, including Onetti. The creation of the mythical city of Santa Mar√≠a in Onetti's novels is often compared to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County.\n\nHowever, the quote mentioning a novel that has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" was not said about a work by Onetti. Borges used this description for **Graham Greene's novel *Brighton Rock***. Borges published a review of this novel on October 14, 1938, which was later included in his collection *Textos cautivos*.\n\nTherefore, no single novel fits both parts of the question. The quote refers to Graham Greene's *Brighton Rock*, while the description of a Faulknerian successor points to the work of Juan Carlos Onetti, such as his novel *El astillero* (The Shipyard).\n\n<<<The question is based on a false premise, combining a quote about Graham Greene's *Brighton Rock* with a description of Juan Carlos Onetti.>>>"
