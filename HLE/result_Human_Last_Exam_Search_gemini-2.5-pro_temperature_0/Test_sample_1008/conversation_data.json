    "In the film industry, the hierarchy of sound importance in dance scenes is determined by the primary function of the scene, which is to showcase dance. Music serves as the fundamental driver of the dance, dictating the rhythm, mood, and choreography. Sound effects, such as the tapping of feet or the swish of clothing, are crucial for adding a layer of realism and texture to the dancers' movements, making the physical performance more immersive. While dialogue is often prioritized in the overall sound mix of a film to convey narrative information, its importance is typically diminished during dance sequences. Many dance scenes feature no speech at all, relying on the music and the physical performance to convey emotion and story.\n\n<<<Music, sound effects, speech>>>"
