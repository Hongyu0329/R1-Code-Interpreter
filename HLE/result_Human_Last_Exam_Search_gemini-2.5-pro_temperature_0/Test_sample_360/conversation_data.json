    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), two isomers are formed.\n\nThe starting material, `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, reacts with the bidentate ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptzt). In this reaction, the two chloride ligands are replaced by the dptzt ligand to form the complex ion `[Ru(bpy)2(dptzt)]^2+`.\n\nThe resulting product is an octahedral tris(bidentate) ruthenium(II) complex. Both 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) and dptzt are symmetric bidentate ligands. A complex of the type `[M(AA)2(BB)]`, where AA and BB are symmetric chelating ligands, is chiral due to the propeller-like arrangement of the ligands around the central metal ion. This chirality results in the formation of two non-superimposable mirror images, known as enantiomers. These enantiomers are designated as Delta (Δ) and Lambda (Λ).\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces a racemic mixture containing two isomers: the Δ and Λ enantiomers of `[Ru(bpy)2(dptzt)]^2+`.\n\nWhile the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole can also act as a bridging ligand to form dinuclear complexes, which can exist as meso and racemic diastereomers, the reaction with `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` to form a mononuclear complex results in a pair of enantiomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
