    "The problem of classifying quadratic forms over rings like Z/nZ is a classical but complex topic in number theory. A quadratic form in two variables over R=Z/8Z is a polynomial of the form `Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`, where the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are elements of Z/8Z. Two quadratic forms are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables.\n\nA paper by M. Somodi, \"Classification of quadratic forms over Z/p^kZ\", provides a detailed classification. For the ring R=Z/8Z (which is Z/2^3Z), and for quadratic forms in two variables (d=2), the paper lists exactly 20 equivalence classes.\n\nThe classification is broken down by the invariants of the quadratic forms. The representatives of these 20 classes are given as:\n\n*   **Type (0,0):** This corresponds to the zero form `0`.\n*   **Forms with one non-zero coefficient:** `x^2`, `2x^2`, `3x^2`, `4x^2`, `xy`, `2xy`, `4xy`.\n*   **Diagonal forms (b=0):** `x^2+y^2`, `x^2+2y^2`, `x^2+3y^2`, `x^2+4y^2`, `2x^2+3y^2`, `2x^2+5y^2`, `3x^2+3y^2`, `3x^2+4y^2`, `3x^2+5y^2`.\n*   **Forms with bâ‰ 0 that are not equivalent to the above:** `x^2+xy`, `2x^2+2xy`, `3x^2+3xy`.\n\nSumming these up: 1 (zero form) + 7 (one non-zero coefficient) + 9 (diagonal) + 3 (non-diagonal) = 20.\n\nTherefore, there are 20 distinct equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring Z/8Z.\n\n<<<20>>>"
