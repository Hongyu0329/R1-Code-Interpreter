    "### Partition Function in the Grand Canonical Ensemble via Path Integrals\n\nIn the grand canonical ensemble, a system can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir at a fixed temperature, T, and chemical potential, μ_c. The partition function, Z, for such a system is defined as:\n\nZ = Tr[e^(-β(Ĥ - μ_c N̂))]\n\nHere, Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system, N̂ is the particle number operator, and β = 1/(k_B T), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor the specific case where the Hamiltonian is given by Ĥ = -μN̂, the expression inside the trace simplifies. Let's distinguish the chemical potential of the reservoir, μ_c, from the parameter μ in the Hamiltonian. The exponent becomes:\n\n-β(Ĥ - μ_c N̂) = -β(-μN̂ - μ_c N̂) = β(μ + μ_c)N̂\n\nLet's define an effective chemical potential, μ' = μ + μ_c. The partition function is then:\n\nZ = Tr[e^(βμ'N̂)]\n\nTo express this partition function using path integrals, we turn to the coherent state path integral formalism, which is well-suited for the grand canonical ensemble. In this formalism, the partition function is written as a functional integral over fields that depend on imaginary time, τ.\n\nThe general form of the path integral for the grand canonical partition function is:\n\nZ = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S[ψ*, ψ])\n\nwhere ψ* and ψ are the coherent state fields (e.g., complex-valued fields for bosons) and S is the Euclidean action. The action is given by:\n\nS[ψ*, ψ] = ∫₀^β dτ L_E(ψ*, ψ)\n\nwhere L_E is the Euclidean Lagrangian. For a general Hamiltonian H(ψ*, ψ) and chemical potential μ_c, the Lagrangian is:\n\nL_E = ∫d^d x [ψ*(**x**, τ) ∂_τ ψ(**x**, τ) + H(ψ*, ψ) - μ_c N(ψ*, ψ)]\n\nIn our specific case, the term H - μ_c N becomes -μ'N. The number operator N̂ in the second quantized formalism corresponds to the integral of the field density:\n\nN(ψ*, ψ) = ∫d^d x ψ*(**x**, τ) ψ(**x**, τ)\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the action, the term H - μ_c N becomes:\n\nH - μ_c N = -μ' ∫d^d x ψ*(**x**, τ) ψ(**x**, τ)\n\nTherefore, the Euclidean action for this system is:\n\nS[ψ*, ψ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d^d x [ψ*(**x**, τ) ∂_τ ψ(**x**, τ) - μ' ψ*(**x**, τ) ψ(**x**, τ)]\n\nThe partition function Z is the path integral over all possible field configurations with this action:\n\n**Z = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-∫₀^β dτ ∫d^d x [ψ*(**x**, τ) ∂_τ ψ(**x**, τ) - (μ + μ_c) ψ*(**x**, τ) ψ(**x**, τ)])**\n\nThe integration measure D[ψ*, ψ] represents the sum over all possible histories of the fields. The trace operation in the original definition of the partition function imposes boundary conditions on the fields in the imaginary time direction.\n\n*   For **bosons**, the fields are periodic in imaginary time: ψ(**x**, 0) = ψ(**x**, β).\n*   For **fermions**, the fields are anti-periodic in imaginary time: ψ(**x**, 0) = -ψ(**x**, β). In this case, the fields ψ* and ψ are independent Grassmann variables.\n\nThis path integral represents the partition function for a system of non-interacting particles where the energy of each particle is constant and given by -μ. The term -μ' acts as an effective chemical potential that controls the average number of particles in the system.\n\n<<<**Z = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-∫₀^β dτ ∫d^d x [ψ*(**x**, τ) ∂_τ ψ(**x**, τ) - (μ + μ_c) ψ*(**x**, τ) ψ(**x**, τ)])**\n\nwhere:\n*   Z is the grand canonical partition function.\n*   ψ(**x**, τ) and ψ*(**x**, τ) are the fields representing the particles.\n*   β = 1/(k_B T) is the inverse temperature.\n*   μ is the parameter from the Hamiltonian Ĥ = -μN̂.\n*   μ_c is the chemical potential of the reservoir.\n*   The path integral is over all field configurations, with periodic boundary conditions in τ for bosons and anti-periodic boundary conditions for fermions.>>>"
