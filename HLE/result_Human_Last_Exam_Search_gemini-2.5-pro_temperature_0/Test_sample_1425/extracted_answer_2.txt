**Z = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-∫₀^β dτ ∫d^d x [ψ*(**x**, τ) ∂_τ ψ(**x**, τ) - (μ + μ_c) ψ*(**x**, τ) ψ(**x**, τ)])**

where:
*   Z is the grand canonical partition function.
*   ψ(**x**, τ) and ψ*(**x**, τ) are the fields representing the particles.
*   β = 1/(k_B T) is the inverse temperature.
*   μ is the parameter from the Hamiltonian Ĥ = -μN̂.
*   μ_c is the chemical potential of the reservoir.
*   The path integral is over all field configurations, with periodic boundary conditions in τ for bosons and anti-periodic boundary conditions for fermions.
