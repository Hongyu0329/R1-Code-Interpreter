    "### Smallest and Largest Rank of the Néron-Severi Group\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C, can range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 9.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n#### 1. Relating the Symmetric Power to the Jacobian\n\nLet C be a smooth projective curve of genus g, and let X = C^(d) be its d-th symmetric power. The Néron-Severi group, denoted NS(X), is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence, and its rank is the Picard number, ρ(X).\n\nA key result by I.G. Macdonald establishes a relationship between the Picard group of the symmetric power of a curve and the Picard group of its Jacobian variety, J(C). For d ≥ 2g - 1, there is an isomorphism between Pic(C^(d)) and Pic(J(C)).\n\nIn this problem, C has genus g=3 and we are considering its d=15th symmetric power. Since 15 ≥ 2(3) - 1 = 5, the condition is met. Therefore, Pic(X) = Pic(C^(15)) is isomorphic to Pic(J(C)).\n\nThe Néron-Severi group is obtained by taking the quotient of the Picard group by its connected component of the identity.\n*   For X = C^(15), NS(X) ≅ Pic(X) / Pic⁰(X) ≅ Pic(J(C)) / J(C).\n*   For the Jacobian J(C), NS(J(C)) ≅ Pic(J(C)) / Pic⁰(J(C)) ≅ Pic(J(C)) / J(C)^, where J(C)^ is the dual abelian variety.\n\nSince a principally polarized Jacobian is isomorphic to its dual (J(C) ≅ J(C)^), it follows that NS(X) is isomorphic to NS(J(C)). Consequently, their ranks are equal: **ρ(X) = ρ(J(C))**.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n#### 2. Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest rank occurs for a \"very general\" curve C. For such a curve, its Jacobian variety J(C) has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, End(J(C)) = ℤ. In this case, the Néron-Severi group NS(J(C)) is generated by a single element, the class of the principal polarization (theta divisor).\n\nTherefore, NS(J(C)) is isomorphic to ℤ, and its rank is 1.\n\n**The smallest possible rank of NS(X) is 1.**\n\n#### 3. Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension g is bounded above by g². For the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, this means ρ(J(C)) ≤ 3² = 9.\n\nThis maximum rank is achieved for special curves whose Jacobians have complex multiplication (CM). A prime example of such a curve is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation X⁴ + Y⁴ = Z⁴ in the complex projective plane. This is a smooth curve of genus 3.\n\nThe Jacobian of the Fermat quartic, J(F₄), is known to be isogenous to the cube of a single elliptic curve which has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers ℤ[i]. For such abelian varieties with maximal complex multiplication, it is known that all Hodge cycles are algebraic, meaning the Picard number reaches its theoretical maximum.\n\nTherefore, ρ(J(F₄)) = h¹‚¹(J(F₄)) = g² = 9.\n\n**The largest possible rank of NS(X) is 9.**\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 1, and the largest possible rank is 9.>>>"
