    "This document outlines the derivation of the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy for a Bose gas of light quanta (photons) using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.\n\n### 1. Framework: Large Deviations and Statistical Mechanics\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state of a system is the most probable macroscopic state. Large deviation theory (LDT) provides the mathematical framework to determine the probability of rare events, and by extension, to find the most probable state.\n\n*   **Sanov's Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability of an empirical distribution (macrostate) deviating from an expected distribution. The probability of observing a macrostate `ν` is given by `P(L_n ≈ ν) ≈ exp[-n * D(ν || ρ)]`, where `D(ν || ρ)` is the relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) of `ν` with respect to a reference measure `ρ`. In statistical mechanics, this rate function `D(ν || ρ)` is directly related to the negative of the system's entropy. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes this rate function (i.e., maximizes the entropy), subject to physical constraints like fixed total energy.\n\n*   **Cramer's Theorem**: This theorem addresses the probability of the sample mean of a set of random variables deviating from its expected value. The probability that the sample mean is `u` is given by `P(S_n/n ≈ u) ≈ exp[-n * I(u)]`. The rate function `I(u)` is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function, `λ(β) = log E[exp(βX)]`. In physics, `λ(β)` corresponds to the free energy (per particle, divided by temperature), and the rate function `I(u)` is again related to entropy.\n\nFor a gas of photons, we consider the system to be in thermal equilibrium, characterized by a constant temperature `T`, which implies a fixed average total energy. A key characteristic of photons is that their total number is not conserved, which means their chemical potential is zero.\n\n### 2. Derivation via Sanov's Theorem and Entropy Maximization\n\nThe core idea is to find the distribution of photons over energy levels that is the most probable, which corresponds to the macrostate with the highest number of underlying microstates. This is equivalent to maximizing the Boltzmann entropy.\n\n**a. Bose-Einstein Combinatorics and Entropy**\n\nConsider a set of discrete energy levels `ε_s`, each with a degeneracy `g_s` (number of states with the same energy). For bosons (like photons), any number of particles `n_s` can occupy the states in a given energy level. The number of ways to distribute `n_s` indistinguishable particles among `g_s` states is given by the Bose-Einstein combinatorial factor:\n\n`W_s = (n_s + g_s - 1)! / (n_s! * (g_s - 1)!)`\n\nThe total number of microstates for a given macroscopic distribution `{n_s}` is `W = Π_s W_s`. The entropy of the system is given by Boltzmann's principle, `S = k_B * log(W)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nUsing Stirling's approximation (`log(x!) ≈ x*log(x) - x`) for large `n_s` and `g_s`, the entropy becomes:\n\n`S = k_B * Σ_s [ (n_s + g_s)log(n_s + g_s) - n_s*log(n_s) - g_s*log(g_s) ]`\n\nThis expression for entropy is the quantity to be maximized. It represents the negative of the rate function in Sanov's theorem.\n\n**b. Maximization with Constraints**\n\nWe seek the distribution `{n_s}` that maximizes `S` subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy:\n\n`E = Σ_s n_s * ε_s`\n\nSince the number of photons is not conserved, there is no constraint on the total number of particles. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers, maximizing `S/k_B - β(Σ_s n_s * ε_s - E)`, where `β` is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint.\n\nDifferentiating with respect to `n_s` and setting the result to zero yields:\n\n`log((n_s + g_s) / n_s) - β*ε_s = 0`\n\nSolving for the average occupation number `n_s` gives the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for photons:\n\n`n_s / g_s = 1 / (exp(β*ε_s) - 1)`\n\nThe Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified with the inverse temperature, `β = 1 / (k_B * T)`.\n\n### 3. Equilibrium Mean Energy and Entropy\n\n**a. Mean Energy**\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy `U` of the photon gas is the total energy `E` evaluated with the most probable distribution `n_s`.\n\n`U = E = Σ_s (g_s * ε_s) / (exp(ε_s / (k_B*T)) - 1)`\n\nThis formula, when applied to the electromagnetic modes in a cavity, gives the Planck law for black-body radiation, which was the historical starting point for quantum theory.\n\n**b. Entropy**\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium value of `n_s` back into the entropy formula gives the equilibrium entropy:\n\n`S = (E/T) + k_B * Σ_s g_s * log(1 - exp(-ε_s / (k_B*T)))`\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the Helmholtz Free Energy, `F = E - TS`, where for a photon gas:\n\n`F = k_B*T * Σ_s g_s * log(1 - exp(-ε_s / (k_B*T)))`\n\n### 4. Confirmation with Cramer's Theorem\n\nCramer's theorem provides an alternative path to the same results by focusing on the mean energy.\n\n1.  **Partition Function**: The cumulant generating function in LDT is analogous to the logarithm of the partition function in statistical mechanics. For a grand canonical ensemble of bosons, the partition function `Z` is a product over the partition functions for each state `s`. Since any number of photons can be in a state, we have a geometric series:\n    `Z_s = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} exp(-n * β * ε_s) = 1 / (1 - exp(-β*ε_s))`\n\n    The total partition function (for all degenerate states) is `Z = Π_s (Z_s)^{g_s}`.\n\n2.  **Cumulant Generating Function**: The logarithm of `Z` is the cumulant generating function (related to the free energy `F = -k_B*T*log(Z)`):\n    `log(Z(β)) = -Σ_s g_s * log(1 - exp(-β*ε_s))`\n\n3.  **Mean Energy**: The mean energy `U` is the negative derivative of `log(Z)` with respect to `β`:\n    `U = -d(log Z) / dβ = Σ_s (g_s * ε_s) / (exp(β*ε_s) - 1)`\n    This result is identical to the one obtained from the entropy maximization approach.\n\n4.  **Rate Function and Entropy**: The rate function from Cramer's theorem is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of `log(Z)`:\n    `I(U) = sup_β { βU - log(Z(β)) }`\n    The supremum is found where the derivative with respect to `β` is zero, which is precisely the condition that defines the equilibrium mean energy `U`. At this equilibrium value, the rate function is:\n    `I(U) = βU - log(Z(β)) = (U - F/N) / (k_B*T)`\n    This quantity is directly proportional to the negative of the thermodynamic entropy per particle, `I(U) = -S / (N*k_B)`. This confirms that minimizing the large deviation rate function is equivalent to maximizing the entropy, linking the two theorems.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy for a gas of light quanta distributed over energy levels `ε_s` with degeneracies `g_s` at a temperature `T` is given by:\n\n`U = Σ_s (g_s * ε_s) / (exp(ε_s / (k_B*T)) - 1)`\n\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy `S` for this system is:\n\n`S = (U/T) - k_B * Σ_s g_s * log(1 - exp(-ε_s / (k_B*T)))`\n\nThese expressions are the fundamental results for the thermodynamics of black-body radiation and other systems of non-interacting bosons where the particle number is not conserved.\n>>>"
