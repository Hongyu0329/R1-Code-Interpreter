In scalar field theory, for spatial dimensionalities *d* below the upper critical dimension of four, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with *d* according to the epsilon expansion, where ε = 4 - *d*. This scaling is derived from the hyperscaling relation α = 2 - ν*d*, combined with the epsilon expansion for the correlation length exponent ν.

For a general O(N)-symmetric model, the quantitative scaling of α up to the second order in ε (two-loop approximation) is given by the formula:

α = (4-N)/(2(N+8))ε - (N+2)(N²+24N+68)/(4(N+8)³)ε² + O(ε³)

To the first order in ε (one-loop), this simplifies to:

α ≈ (4-N)/(2(N+8))ε

For the Ising model (N=1), the one-loop approximation gives α ≈ ε/6. These expressions show that α is not a simple power law of *d* but is expressed as a power series in ε = 4 - *d*.
