    "The computational time complexity of the given algorithm, IMAG(n, c), depends on the number of iterations in the `while` loop and the cost of the operations within that loop.\n\n1.  **Loop Iterations**: The `while` loop continues as long as `q` is greater than 0. The value of `q` is initialized as `⌊n/c⌋` and in each subsequent step of the loop, it is updated to `⌊x/c⌋`, where `x` was the previous value of `q`. This is equivalent to repeatedly dividing `n` by `c`. The loop terminates when the result of the division becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is less than 1 is given by `log_c(n)`. Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n2.  **Operations Inside the Loop**: Within the loop, the algorithm performs a fixed number of basic arithmetic operations: an increment (`i := i + 1`), an assignment (`x := q`), an integer division (`q := ⌊x/c⌋`), a multiplication (`qc`), and a subtraction (`a_i := x - qc`).\n\nCombining these two points, the total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the cost of the operations in each iteration. Assuming that the arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction) on numbers the size of `n` or smaller can be performed in constant time, the complexity is determined by the number of loop iterations.\n\nTherefore, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is O(log<sub>c</sub>n).\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
