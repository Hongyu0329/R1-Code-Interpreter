    "The number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, which is also known as a square lattice, is a well-studied problem in combinatorics and physics. While there is no simple formula to calculate this for any given *n*, the values for small *n* have been computed exactly.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. The sequence begins with a(0) = 1, representing a walk of zero steps. The subsequent terms are:\n\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\nThese values are determined through computational algorithms that enumerate all possible self-avoiding paths of a given length.\n\nTherefore, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
