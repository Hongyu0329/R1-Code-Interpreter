    "Based on the principles of historical linguistics and phonological changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to later Germanic languages, the development of PIE `*seh2gieti` can be traced as follows.\n\nThe PIE verb `*seh2gieti`, meaning \"'(s)he gives a sign'\", is the ancestor of the Germanic verb \"to seek\". The evolution of this word reflects major sound changes such as Grimm's Law, the treatment of PIE laryngeals, and subsequent developments within the individual Germanic languages.\n\nHere are the resultant forms in the requested languages:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkīþi` ('(s)he seeks').\n    *   The PIE root `*seh2g-` evolved into `*sōk-`. The laryngeal `*h2` colored the preceding `*e` to an `*a` and lengthened it, which then became `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   According to Grimm's Law, the PIE voiced stop `*g` became the voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   The PIE present tense ending `*-ieti` became `*-īþi` for this class of verbs.\n\n*   **Old Norse:** `sǿkir`\n    *   The Proto-Germanic infinitive `*sōkijaną` became `sǿkja` in Old Norse.\n    *   The long vowel `*ō` in the root underwent i-umlaut (or i-mutation) due to the following `*i` in the suffix, changing it to `ǿ`.\n    *   The 3rd person singular present indicative ending in Old Norse for this verb class is `-ir`.\n\n*   **Old English:** `sēċþ` (also found as `sēceð`).\n    *   The Proto-Germanic `*ō` underwent i-mutation to `*ē` in Old English.\n    *   The Proto-Germanic `*k` was palatalized to `ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/, like \"ch\" in \"church\") before the front vowel `e`.\n    *   The Proto-Germanic ending `*-īþi` reduced to `-þ` or `-eþ`. The infinitive form is `sēċan`.\n\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhit`\n    *   In Old High German, the Proto-Germanic long vowel `*ō` was diphthongized to `uo`.\n    *   As part of the High German Consonant Shift, the Proto-Germanic `*k` became the voiceless fricative `hh` (pronounced /x/) when between vowels.\n    *   The 3rd person singular ending became `-it`. The infinitive form is `suohhen`.\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkīþi`\n**Old Norse:** `sǿkir`\n**Old English:** `sēċþ`\n**Old High German:** `suohhit`>>>"
