    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a Galois connection between posets. Specifically, an adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), satisfying the condition:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$.\n\nFor a map between posets to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all suprema (joins). The objects of the simplex category, $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, are complete lattices. The supremum of any non-empty subset of $[k]$ is its maximum element, and any order-preserving map between chains preserves maxima. However, the supremum of the empty set is the minimum element, which is 0. Therefore, for $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve the empty join, which imposes the condition $L(0) = 0$.\n\nAny order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ with $L(0)=0$ is a left adjoint and uniquely determines its corresponding right adjoint $R$. Consequently, the number of internal adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is equal to the number of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\nIn this problem, we need to find the number of adjunctions from $$ to $$. This is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ that satisfy $L(0)=0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $L: \\to$ is defined by a sequence of values $(L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23))$ such that $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$. The condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first element of this sequence. Thus, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of the form:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$ where each element is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has 38 elements) with replacement, and the order of selection does not matter as the sequence is sorted.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} $$\nHere, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) and $n=38$ (the number of possible values, from 0 to 37).\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAlternatively, one could count the number of right adjoints $R: \\to$. A right adjoint must preserve all infima (meets), which implies that $R(37) = 23$. This leads to counting the number of order-preserving sequences $R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$. This is equivalent to choosing 37 values from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (24 elements) with replacement, which gives $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$. Since $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<$\\binom{60}{23}$>>>"
