    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The cardinality of $X$ is at most the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to establish this upper bound:\n\n1.  **The nature of the dense open subset U**: The set $U$ is a topological n-manifold because every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $U$ is a subset of the metric space $X$, $U$ itself is a metrizable topological space.\n\n2.  **Metrizability and second-countability of U**: A manifold is metrizable if and only if it is paracompact. Since $U$ is metrizable, it is paracompact. A connected paracompact manifold is also second-countable. A space is second-countable if it has a countable basis for its topology.\n\n3.  **Cardinality of U**: Any non-empty open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Since $U$ is a second-countable manifold, it can be expressed as a countable union of open sets that are homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The cardinality of a countable union of sets of cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is $\\aleph_0 \\cdot 2^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Therefore, the cardinality of $U$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n4.  **Relating the cardinality of X to the cardinality of its dense subset U**: For any Hausdorff space $X$ (which a metric space is) with a dense subset $U$, the cardinality of $X$ is bounded by $|X| \\le |U|^{\\chi(X)}$, where $\\chi(X)$ is the character of the space, defined as the minimum cardinality of a local base for any point in $X$.\n\n5.  **The character of a metric space**: Every metric space is first-countable, which means that every point has a countable local base of open neighborhoods. Therefore, the character $\\chi(X)$ of the metric space $X$ is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n6.  **Calculating the upper bound for the cardinality of X**: Substituting the known values into the inequality from step 4, we get:\n    $|X| \\le (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    Thus, the cardinality of $X$ is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n7.  **The lower bound for the cardinality of X**: Since $X$ is a connected metric space with more than one point, it must be uncountable and its cardinality is at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This can be shown by constructing a continuous function from $X$ onto the interval $$.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, the cardinality of $X$ is exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<Yes, the cardinality of X is bounded above by $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
