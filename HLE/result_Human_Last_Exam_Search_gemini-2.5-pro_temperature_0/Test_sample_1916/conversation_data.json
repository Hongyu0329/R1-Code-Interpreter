    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The object is the single element of the object class, and the morphisms are the elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism corresponds to the identity element of the monoid. An isomorphism of such categories is equivalent to an isomorphism of the corresponding monoids.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Let the set of morphisms be M = {e, a, b}, where 'e' is the identity morphism. We need to define the composition table for these morphisms, which must be associative.\n\nThe non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, C₃ (or Z₃):**\n    The elements are {e, a, a²}, with a³ = e. Here, b = a².\n    The composition table is:\n| ∘ | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | b | e |\n| b | b | e | a |\n\n2.  **The monoid {e, a, a²} with a³ = a²:**\n    The elements are generated by 'a', but it's not a group. Here, b = a².\n    The composition table is:\n| ∘ | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | b | b |\n| b | b | b | b |\n\n3.  **The left-zero semigroup with identity:**\n    Here, a² = a, b² = b, a∘b = a, and b∘a = a. This monoid is isomorphic to the right-zero semigroup with identity (where a∘b = b and b∘a = b) by swapping 'a' and 'b'.\n    The composition table is:\n| ∘ | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | a | a |\n| b | b | a | b |\n\n4.  **The monoid where a∘b = b and b∘a = a:**\n    Here, a² = a and b² = b.\n    The composition table is:\n| ∘ | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | a | b |\n| b | b | a | b |\n\n5.  **The null semigroup with identity:**\n    Here, a² = b² = a∘b = b∘a = 0 (where 0 is a zero element). In our notation with {e, a, b}, we can define a zero element, say 'b', such that for any x in {a, b}, x∘b = b∘x = b, and a∘a = b.\n    Let's define a monoid where a² = b, a∘b = b, b∘a = b, b² = b. This is not it.\n    The correct structure is where any composition of non-identity elements gives a single \"zero\" element. Let's call this zero element 'z'. So, M = {e, a, z}. Then a∘a = z, a∘z = z, z∘a = z, z∘z = z. This is a monoid of order 3.\n    The composition table is:\n| ∘ | e | a | z |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | z |\n| a | a | z | z |\n| z | z | z | z |\n\nThese are the 5 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<5>>>"
