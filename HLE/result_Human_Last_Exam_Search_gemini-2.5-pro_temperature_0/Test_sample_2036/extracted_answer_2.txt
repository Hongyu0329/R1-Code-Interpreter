It is not feasible to provide a precise distance from the VOR, as the critical factor is the arriving aircraft's position relative to the runway threshold during its visual circling maneuver. The takeoff clearance for the departing aircraft would typically be issued when the arriving aircraft is established on its final approach to Runway 12 and is within 2-3 nautical miles of landing.
