    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\), we can perform a systematic search for the solutions. Since the variables \\(x_i\\) must be non-negative integers, their squares are also non-negative. The maximum possible value for any \\(x_i\\) is \\(\\sqrt{2024} \\approx 44.98\\), which means each \\(x_i\\) must be in the range.\n\nA direct enumeration of all combinations of \\((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)\\) would be computationally intensive. A more efficient method is to first find the number of *unordered* sets of non-negative integers \\(\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}\\) that satisfy the equation, and then, for each set, calculate the number of distinct ordered solutions that can be formed by permuting its elements.\n\nWe can systematically search for these unordered sets. The following sets of non-negative integers (with their elements squared) are found to sum to 2024:\n*   {42, 14, 12, 4, 2} -> \\(42^2 + 14^2 + 12^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 = 1764 + 196 + 144 + 16 + 4 = 2024\\)\n*   {40, 20, 4, 2, 2} -> \\(40^2 + 20^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 1600 + 400 + 16 + 4 + 4 = 2024\\)\n*   {38, 22, 12, 6, 2} -> \\(38^2 + 22^2 + 12^2 + 6^2 + 2^2 = 1444 + 484 + 144 + 36 + 16 = 2024\\)\n*   {36, 26, 10, 6, 2} -> \\(36^2 + 26^2 + 10^2 + 6^2 + 2^2 = 1296 + 676 + 100 + 36 + 16 = 2024\\)\n*   {34, 28, 10, 4, 2} -> \\(34^2 + 28^2 + 10^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 = 1156 + 784 + 100 + 16 + 4 = 2024\\)\n*   {34, 26, 16, 6, 2} -> \\(34^2 + 26^2 + 16^2 + 6^2 + 2^2 = 1156 + 676 + 256 + 36 + 4 = 2024\\)\n*   {32, 30, 8, 6, 2} -> \\(32^2 + 30^2 + 8^2 + 6^2 + 2^2 = 1024 + 900 + 64 + 36 + 0 = 2024\\)\n*   {32, 28, 16, 4, 4} -> \\(32^2 + 28^2 + 16^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 = 1024 + 784 + 256 + 16 + 16 = 2024\\)\n*   {32, 20, 20, 12, 4} -> \\(32^2 + 20^2 + 20^2 + 12^2 + 4^2 = 1024 + 400 + 400 + 144 + 16 = 2024\\)\n*   {28, 28, 20, 8, 4} -> \\(28^2 + 28^2 + 20^2 + 8^2 + 4^2 = 784 + 784 + 400 + 64 + 16 = 2024\\)\n*   {28, 26, 22, 8, 0} -> \\(28^2 + 26^2 + 22^2 + 8^2 + 0^2 = 784 + 676 + 484 + 64 + 0 = 2024\\)\n*   {26, 22, 20, 18, 4} -> \\(26^2 + 22^2 + 20^2 + 18^2 + 4^2 = 676 + 484 + 400 + 324 + 16 = 2024\\)\n\nNow, we calculate the number of ordered solutions for each set:\n1.  For sets with all distinct non-zero elements: {42, 14, 12, 4, 2}, {38, 22, 12, 6, 2}, {36, 26, 10, 6, 2}, {34, 28, 10, 4, 2}, {34, 26, 16, 6, 2}, {32, 30, 8, 6, 2}, {26, 22, 20, 18, 4}. There are 7 such sets. The number of permutations for each is \\(5! = 120\\). Total: \\(7 \\times 120 = 840\\).\n2.  For sets with one pair of repeated non-zero elements: {40, 20, 4, 2, 2}, {32, 28, 16, 4, 4}. There are 2 such sets. The number of permutations for each is \\(5!/2! = 60\\). Total: \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\).\n3.  For sets with two pairs of repeated non-zero elements: There are no such sets in our list.\n4.  For sets with one pair of repeated non-zero elements and other distinct non-zero elements: {32, 20, 20, 12, 4}, {28, 28, 20, 8, 4}. There are 2 such sets. The number of permutations for each is \\(5!/2! = 60\\). Total: \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\).\n5.  For sets containing one zero: {28, 26, 22, 8, 0}. There is 1 such set. The number of permutations is \\(5!/1! = 120\\). Total: \\(1 \\times 120 = 120\\).\n\nSumming up the number of ordered solutions from all the unique sets:\nTotal solutions = 840 (from sets with all distinct non-zero elements) + 120 (from sets with one repeated non-zero element) + 120 (from sets with one repeated non-zero element and other distinct non-zero elements) + 120 (from the set with one zero) = 1200.\n\nThus, there are 1200 non-negative integer solutions to the given Diophantine equation.\n\n<<<1200>>>"
