    "The English term \"shock absorber\" is most commonly borrowed into Puerto Rican Spanish in its shortened, plural form, \"shocks.\" The standard Spanish term is *amortiguador* or, more specifically, *amortiguador de choque*. When the English term is used, it undergoes several phonological adaptations to fit the sound system of Puerto Rican Spanish.\n\nBased on the phonological characteristics of this dialect, the phonetic transcription of the borrowed word \"shocks\" would be:\n\n**[ˈtʃo̞ke̞h]** or often with the final /s/ deleted, **[ˈtʃo̞ke̞]**. In some instances, it might be heard as **[ˈtʃo̞k]**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the phonetic changes:\n\n*   **The \"sh\" sound (/ʃ/):** Spanish does not have the voiceless postalveolar fricative /ʃ/ (the \"sh\" sound). In Puerto Rican Spanish, as in many other dialects, this sound is often replaced by the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /tʃ/ (the \"ch\" sound in \"cheese\"). Therefore, \"shock\" begins with a \"ch\" sound.\n\n*   **The vowel \"o\" (/ɒ/):** The open-mid back rounded vowel of \"shock\" in English is adapted to the closest Spanish vowel, the mid back rounded vowel /o/.\n\n*   **The \"ck\" sound (/k/):** The voiceless velar plosive /k/ exists in Spanish and is maintained.\n\n*   **Plural \"-s\":** A defining feature of Puerto Rican Spanish is the weakening of the /s/ sound at the end of a syllable or word (coda position). This /s/ is typically aspirated to a voiceless glottal fricative [h] or is deleted entirely. When the plural form \"shocks\" is borrowed, an epenthetic vowel /e/ is often added before the plural marker to conform to Spanish phonotactics, resulting in a final \"-es\" sound that is then subject to the aspiration or deletion of the /s/.\n\nConsidering the full term \"shock absorber,\" while less common as a direct borrowing, its pronunciation would be adapted as follows:\n\n*   **Shock:** [ˈtʃo̞k]\n*   **Absorber:** The English /r/ in \"absorber\" is particularly variable in Puerto Rican Spanish. It could be realized as a flap [ɾ], lateralized to an [l], or pronounced as a uvular or velar fricative [χ]. The initial unstressed vowel would likely be pronounced as [a], and the stressed \"o\" as [o]. The /b/ would be pronounced as a fricative [β] between vowels, and the syllable-final /s/ would be aspirated or deleted.\n\nTherefore, a possible transcription for the full phrase would be highly variable, for instance: **[tʃo̞k að.so̞ɾˈβeɾ]** or **[tʃo̞k að.so̞lˈβel]**.\n\nHowever, the most common and representative phonetic transcription for the English borrowing is for the shortened form \"shocks.\"\n\n<<<[ˈtʃo̞ke̞h]>>>"
