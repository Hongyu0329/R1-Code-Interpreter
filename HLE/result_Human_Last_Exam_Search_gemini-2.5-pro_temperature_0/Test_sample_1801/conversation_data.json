    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nThe advertising campaign, which aimed to portray Enron as an innovative and forward-thinking company, featured several notable personalities. Among them were Gell-Mann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles. The other Nobel laureate identified in the commercials was Amartya Sen, an Indian economist who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign, with its abstract and thought-provoking style, has been retrospectively viewed with irony given Enron's subsequent collapse in 2001 due to a massive accounting fraud scandal. The commercials encouraged questioning the status quo, a message that became tragically poignant after the company's deceptive practices were revealed.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
