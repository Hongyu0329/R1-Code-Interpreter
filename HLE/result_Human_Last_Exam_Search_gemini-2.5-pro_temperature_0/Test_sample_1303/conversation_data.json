    "The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 has been identified to interact with Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6). While the specific identity of CHEMBL4803817 remains undefined in the ChEMBL database, its interaction with GAS6 provides a clear pathway to identify other small molecules involved in similar protein-ligand interactions. GAS6 is the primary ligand for the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which includes Axl, MerTK, and Tyro3. Therefore, small molecules that target GAS6 or its receptors will exhibit some form of protein-ligand interaction within this same signaling pathway.\n\nA variety of small molecules have been developed to inhibit the activity of the TAM kinases, and these can be categorized by their primary targets within the pathway.\n\n### **Small Molecule Inhibitors of the GAS6/TAM Pathway**\n\n**Axl Inhibitors:**\nThe Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is a prominent target for cancer therapy, and numerous small molecule inhibitors have been developed. These molecules typically work by binding to the ATP-binding site of the Axl kinase domain, which prevents its activation and downstream signaling.\nExamples of Axl inhibitors include:\n*   **Bemcentinib (BGB324):** A highly selective Axl inhibitor that has been investigated in clinical trials for various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and melanoma.\n*   **Sitravatinib:** A multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that shows activity against Axl, c-Kit, and PDGFR, among others.\n*   **Bosutinib (BOSULIF®):** A dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor that also targets Axl.\n*   **Cabozantinib (XL184):** A multi-kinase inhibitor with activity against Axl, MET, and VEGFR2, which is in clinical trials for various cancers.\n*   **Gilteritinib (ASP2215):** A dual inhibitor of FLT3 and AXL that has received orphan drug status for AML.\n*   **Crizotinib (XALKORI®):** A kinase inhibitor that targets ALK, ROS1, and MET, and also shows inhibitory activity against Axl.\n*   **S49076:** An ATP-competitive inhibitor of MET, AXL/MER, and FGFR1/2/3.\n*   **LY2801653:** A multi-kinase inhibitor targeting MET, AXL, and MST1R.\n*   **Amuvatinib (MP470):** A multi-kinase inhibitor with activity against AXL.\n*   **SGI-7079:** A highly specific AXL inhibitor.\n*   **Dubermatinib (TP-0903):** An inhibitor of AXL, JAK2, ALK, ABL1, and VEGFR2.\n\n**MerTK Inhibitors:**\nMerTK is another member of the TAM family and a target for cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n*   **UNC2025:** A potent and orally bioavailable dual inhibitor of MerTK and FLT3. It has been shown to decrease platelet activation and has been studied in leukemia models.\n*   **MRX-2843:** A MERTK kinase inhibitor that has been evaluated in combination with other targeted therapies for NSCLC.\n\n**Tyro3 Inhibitors:**\nTyro3 is the third member of the TAM kinase family. While it has been studied less than Axl and MerTK, some inhibitors have been identified.\n*   **BMS-777607:** A multi-kinase inhibitor with activity against c-Met, Axl, Ron, and Tyro3.\n*   **LDC1267:** A highly selective TAM kinase inhibitor with potent activity against Mer, Tyro3, and Axl.\n*   **UNC3810A:** A selective small molecule inhibitor developed specifically for Tyro3.\n\n**Pan-TAM Inhibitors:**\nSome small molecules are designed to inhibit all three TAM kinases.\n*   **RU-301 and RU-302:** These compounds are described as pan-TAM inhibitors that block the interaction between GAS6 and the TAM receptors.\n\nThese small molecules represent a range of compounds that, like CHEMBL4803817, are involved in protein-ligand interactions within the GAS6/TAM signaling axis.\n\n<<<The small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 are other molecules that interact with the Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6) or its receptors, the TAM kinases (Axl, MerTK, and Tyro3). A comprehensive list of these small molecules includes Axl inhibitors like Bemcentinib (BGB324), Sitravatinib, Bosutinib, Cabozantinib, Gilteritinib, Crizotinib, S49076, LY2801653, Amuvatinib (MP470), SGI-7079, and Dubermatinib (TP-0903). MerTK inhibitors include UNC2025 and MRX-2843. Tyro3 inhibitors include BMS-777607, LDC1267, and UNC3810A. Additionally, pan-TAM inhibitors such as RU-301 and RU-302 also interact with this pathway."
