The small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 are other molecules that interact with the Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6) or its receptors, the TAM kinases (Axl, MerTK, and Tyro3). A comprehensive list of these small molecules includes Axl inhibitors like Bemcentinib (BGB324), Sitravatinib, Bosutinib, Cabozantinib, Gilteritinib, Crizotinib, S49076, LY2801653, Amuvatinib (MP470), SGI-7079, and Dubermatinib (TP-0903). MerTK inhibitors include UNC2025 and MRX-2843. Tyro3 inhibitors include BMS-777607, LDC1267, and UNC3810A. Additionally, pan-TAM inhibitors such as RU-301 and RU-302 also interact with this pathway.
