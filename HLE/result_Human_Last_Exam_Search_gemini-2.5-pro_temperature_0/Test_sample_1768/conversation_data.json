    "The provided nucleotide sequence can be read in three possible forward reading frames. Since the sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), the correct frame will not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Begins with the first nucleotide (`g`ga...). This frame contains a `TAG` stop codon early in the sequence, so it is incorrect.\n*   **Frame 2:** Begins with the second nucleotide (`g` `gac`...). This frame is open and does not contain any stop codons.\n*   **Frame 3:** Begins with the third nucleotide (`gg` `aca`...). This frame contains a `TGA` stop codon, so it is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKVFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
