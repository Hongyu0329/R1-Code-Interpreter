    "An antichain in a poset is a subset of elements where no two are related by the order. In the context of the divisor poset on the set of integers S = [1, n], an antichain is a subset where no integer divides another. A union of k antichains is a set that can be partitioned into k such antichains.\n\nAccording to the dual of Dilworth's theorem (also known as Mirsky's theorem), a set can be partitioned into k antichains if and only if it does not contain a chain of length k+1. A chain in the divisor poset is a sequence of numbers a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ such that a₁ | a₂ | ... | aₘ, where '|' denotes divisibility and all elements are distinct.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest union of 20 antichains in the set S = [1, 823564528378596]. This is equivalent to finding the largest subset of S that does not contain a chain of length 21. Such a subset is also called a 20-Sperner family.\n\nLet n = 823564528378596. We are looking for the maximum size of a subset A ⊆ [1, n] such that there is no chain of 21 distinct numbers a₁ | a₂ | ... | a₂₁ with all aᵢ ∈ A.\n\nConsider the set A = {x ∈ [1, n] | x > floor(n / 2²⁰)}. Let's check if this set contains a chain of length 21.\nLet a₁, a₂, ..., a₂₁ be a chain of distinct elements in A.\nFrom the definition of a chain, we have aᵢ₊₁ = dᵢ * aᵢ for some integer dᵢ > 1. This implies aᵢ₊₁ ≥ 2 * aᵢ.\nTherefore, a₂₁ ≥ 2²⁰ * a₁.\nAll elements of the chain are in A, so a₁ must satisfy a₁ > floor(n / 2²⁰).\nSince a₁ is an integer, this means a₁ ≥ floor(n / 2²⁰) + 1.\nLet F = floor(n / 2²⁰). Then a₁ ≥ F + 1.\nSo, a₂₁ ≥ 2²⁰ * a₁ ≥ 2²⁰ * (F + 1).\nBy the definition of the floor function, F ≤ n / 2²⁰ < F + 1.\nMultiplying by 2²⁰, we get 2²⁰ * F ≤ n < 2²⁰ * (F + 1).\nCombining the inequalities, we have a₂₁ ≥ 2²⁰ * (F + 1) > n.\nThis means a₂₁ cannot be in the set S = [1, n], which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the set A = {x ∈ [1, n] | x > floor(n / 2²⁰)} does not contain a chain of length 21.\n\nThe size of this set is n - floor(n / 2²⁰). This construction provides a lower bound for the size of the largest 20-Sperner family. For the divisor poset on [1, n], it is a known (though non-trivial) result that this is indeed the largest such set.\n\nNow, we need to calculate this value.\nFirst, we calculate 2²⁰:\n2¹⁰ = 1024\n2²⁰ = (2¹⁰)² = 1024² = 1048576.\n\nNext, we compute floor(n / 2²⁰):\nn = 823564528378596\nfloor(823564528378596 / 1048576) = floor(785413.000...) = 785413.\n\nFinally, the size of the largest union of 20 antichains is:\nSize = n - floor(n / 2²⁰) = 823564528378596 - 785413 = 823563742965183.\n\n<<<823563742965183>>>"
