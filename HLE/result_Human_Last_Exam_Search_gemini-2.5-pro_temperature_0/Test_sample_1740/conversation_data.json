    "To date, the human let-7 family of microRNAs consists of 10 to 13 members, depending on whether one is referring to the mature microRNA sequences or the precursor genes that encode them.\n\nIn humans, there are 10 identified mature let-7 family members. These include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202.\n\nThese mature microRNAs are encoded by 13 precursor genes located on nine different chromosomes. For example, the mature let-7a sequence is produced from three distinct gene loci (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3). Similarly, let-7f is encoded by two different genes (let-7f-1 and let-7f-2).\n\nSome sources may refer to nine mature let-7 miRNAs encoded by 12 different genomic loci, a slightly different count that highlights the complexity and ongoing research in the field. The let-7 family is highly conserved across species and was one of the first families of microRNAs to be discovered.\n\n<<<13>>>"
