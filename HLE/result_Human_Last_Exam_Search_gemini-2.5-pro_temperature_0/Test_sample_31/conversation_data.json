    "To fully identify which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases is present, a solver must see a minimum of 5 non-top-facing stickers.\n\nDuring the PLL step of the CFOP method, all the top-layer stickers are oriented, meaning they all face the same direction (e.g., all yellow stickers are facing up). The information required to distinguish one permutation from another comes from the side stickers of the four corner pieces and four edge pieces in the last layer.\n\nWhile many speedcubers use \"2-sided recognition\" by looking at two adjacent faces of the cube (such as the front and right faces), this view reveals six sticker faces. However, analysis has shown that one of these stickers is redundant. It is possible to uniquely determine the case by observing only five specific stickers. For example, one such combination of five stickers is those on the UFL, UF, UFR, UR, and UBR pieces.\n\nFewer than five stickers can lead to ambiguity, where multiple PLL cases could display the same pattern. For instance, distinguishing between certain G-perms or between an F-perm and a U-perm requires looking at multiple points of reference that cannot be covered by fewer than five stickers. Therefore, five is the established minimum number of stickers that must be seen to ensure a correct identification every time.\n\n<<<5>>>"
