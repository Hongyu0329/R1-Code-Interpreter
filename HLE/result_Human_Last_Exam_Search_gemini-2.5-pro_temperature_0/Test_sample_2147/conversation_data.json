    "Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician, is not documented as having accused Western culture of his time of being a \"stagnant swamp.\" Extensive research into his writings and speeches does not reveal any such quote.\n\nMilyukov was, in fact, a leading \"Westernizer\" in Russia. He admired the political values of democratic nations and advocated for Russia to adopt similar systems, such as parliamentary government, the rule of law, and broad civil freedoms. His primary focus of criticism was the Tsarist autocracy, which he viewed as the main impediment to Russia's progress.\n\nHis historical analysis often compared Russia's development to that of Western Europe, arguing that Russia was on a similar trajectory, although at a slower pace. He was a founder and leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (the Kadets), which aimed to transform Russia into a constitutional monarchy.\n\nWhile Milyukov's political positions evolved throughout his life, particularly after the Russian Revolution, there is no evidence to suggest he held a view that would lead him to denounce key aspects of Western culture as a \"stagnant swamp.\" The quote appears to be a misattribution.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to identify \"X-Y\" as the subject of this denunciation, as the denunciation itself is not substantiated by available historical records.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer as the premise of the question appears to be incorrect.>>>"
