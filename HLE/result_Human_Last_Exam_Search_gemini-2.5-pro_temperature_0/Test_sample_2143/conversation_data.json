    "According to the interpretation by Veronique Campan, the \"HE\" being referred to is Moses.\n\nThe user's query connects several distinct elements that all point to the biblical figure of Moses as the subject. The \"prohibition against representation\" is a direct reference to the second of the Ten Commandments, which forbids the creation of graven images or idols. The issue of \"another's material possessions\" is addressed in the final commandments, specifically the prohibitions against stealing and coveting a neighbor's property.\n\nThese commandments are a central part of the Decalogue, which, according to the narrative in the Hebrew Bible, was given to Moses on Mount Sinai. This body of law is a cornerstone of the Torah, which is considered his work.\n\nVeronique Campan is cited for her analysis of \"The Decalogue,\" specifically in the context of Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski's renowned film series based on the Ten Commandments. Her interpretation focuses on how these ancient laws are represented and actualized through the visual medium of film. Therefore, while Campan's direct analysis may be of a modern cinematic work, the original author of the laws she is interpreting is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
