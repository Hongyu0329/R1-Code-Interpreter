    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\n**1. Market Equilibrium:**\n\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)\n*   **Demand:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\nAt equilibrium, Q_S = Q_D = Q\\* and the price is P\\*. We find the equilibrium quantity (Q\\*) by setting the two equations equal to each other:\nln(Q\\*³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q\\*))\n\nSolving this equation requires numerical methods. The solution is approximately:\n*   **Equilibrium Quantity (Q\\*) ≈ 4.6955**\n\nWe can find the equilibrium price (P\\*) by substituting Q\\* into either the supply or demand equation:\n*   **Equilibrium Price (P\\*) ≈ 4.6208**\n\n**2. Total Welfare Calculation:**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve above the equilibrium price. It is calculated as:\n    CS = ∫[from 0 to Q\\*] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (P\\* * Q\\*)\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve below the equilibrium price. The supply function is defined for Q > ∛2 (approximately 1.26). It is calculated as:\n    PS = (P\\* * Q\\*) - ∫[from ∛2 to Q\\*] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\n*   **Total Welfare (TW):**\n    TW = CS + PS = ∫[from 0 to Q\\*] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[from ∛2 to Q\\*] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nThese integrals must be solved using numerical integration.\n\n*   The value of the demand integral, ∫[from 0 to 4.6955] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ, is approximately **34.135**.\n*   The value of the supply integral, ∫[from 1.2599 to 4.6955] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ, is approximately **10.95**.\n\nTherefore, the total welfare is:\nTW ≈ 34.135 - 10.95 = 23.185\n\n<<<23.185>>>"
