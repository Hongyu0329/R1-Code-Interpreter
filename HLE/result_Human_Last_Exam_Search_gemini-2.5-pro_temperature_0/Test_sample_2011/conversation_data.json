    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Definition of a Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent, meaning the induced subgraph is a complete graph.\n*   **Clique Number:** The clique number of a graph G, denoted ω(G), is the size of the largest clique in G. For a complete graph with n vertices, the clique number is n.\n*   **Induced Subgraphs:** If a graph G contains an induced clique of size k (a K_k), then any subset of those k vertices will also form an induced clique. This means that if a graph has an induced clique of size k_max, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to k_max.\n*   **The Problem:** The question asks for the maximum possible number of *different* clique sizes. Based on the point above, if the largest induced clique in a graph has size k_max, then the set of all induced clique sizes is {1, 2, ..., k_max}. The number of different sizes is therefore k_max.\n*   **Maximizing the Number of Sizes:** To maximize the number of different clique sizes, we need to maximize the size of the largest possible induced clique (the clique number) for a graph with 128 vertices.\n*   **Maximum Clique Number:** For any graph with n vertices, the clique number can be at most n. This maximum is achieved by the complete graph, K_n, which has a clique number of n.\n*   **Conclusion:** For a graph with n = 128 vertices, the maximum possible clique number is 128. This is achieved by the complete graph K_128. In K_128, for any integer k between 1 and 128, any subset of k vertices forms an induced clique of size k. Therefore, the set of all possible induced clique sizes is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}. The number of different sizes is 128.\n\nThe search results also discuss \"maximal cliques\", which are cliques that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. It's important to note the distinction: the question is about induced subgraphs that are cliques (complete subgraphs), not necessarily *maximal* cliques. The logic remains sound as an induced K_k is a complete subgraph of size k, and the existence of a K_k_max implies the existence of all smaller K_k's as induced subgraphs.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning is confirmed. The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is the maximum possible clique number for a graph of that size.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with n = 128 vertices.\n\nLet G be a graph with 128 vertices. Let S be the set of integers k for which a clique of size k (a complete graph K_k) exists as an induced subgraph of G. We want to find the maximum possible value of |S|.\n\nLet k_max be the size of the largest induced clique in G. This is also known as the clique number of G, denoted ω(G). By definition, there exists a set of k_max vertices in G that forms a complete subgraph.\n\nNow, consider any integer j such that 1 ≤ j ≤ k_max. If we take any subset of j vertices from the k_max vertices that form the largest induced clique, this subset will also form an induced clique. This is because all vertices in the larger set are connected to each other, so all vertices in any subset of it are also connected to each other.\n\nThis means that if k_max is in the set S, then all integers from 1 to k_max must also be in S. Therefore, the set of induced clique sizes is S = {1, 2, ..., k_max}. The number of different clique sizes is |S| = k_max.\n\nTo maximize the number of different clique sizes, we need to find the maximum possible value of k_max (the clique number) for a graph with 128 vertices.\n\nFor any graph with n vertices, the clique number is at most n. The maximum possible clique number is achieved by the complete graph K_n, which has a clique number of n.\n\nFor n = 128, the complete graph K_128 has a clique number of 128. In this graph, any subset of k vertices induces a clique of size k for any k from 1 to 128. Thus, for the graph K_128, the set of induced clique sizes is {1, 2, ..., 128}.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes in this case is 128. Since the clique number cannot exceed the number of vertices, this is the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<128>>>"
