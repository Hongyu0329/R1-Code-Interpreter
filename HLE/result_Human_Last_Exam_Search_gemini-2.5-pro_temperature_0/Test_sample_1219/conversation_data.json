    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10¹⁰⁰), we can use the periodic property of the tangent function. The period of tan(x) is π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x + nπ) for any integer n.\n\nThis allows us to simplify the problem by finding the remainder of 10¹⁰⁰ when divided by π. This is a high-precision calculation that can be expressed as:\n\ntan(10¹⁰⁰) = tan(10¹⁰⁰ mod π)\n\nThe calculation of 10¹⁰⁰ mod π requires specialized mathematical software. The result of this operation is approximately 2.44323332.\n\nNow, we can find the tangent of this value (the angle is in radians):\n\ntan(2.44323332) ≈ -0.839082...\n\nThe number is negative, and the first three digits that appear after the decimal comma are 839.\n\n<<<839>>>"
