    "In his emphasis on a global historical perspective, Fernand Braudel quoted Paul Morand's assertion that a \"world-economy\" should be inscribed within a sphere, with a nation serving as one example of such an entity.\n\nThis concept of a \"world-economy\" is central to Braudel's work, particularly in his three-volume \"Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century.\" Braudel defined a world-economy as a large, economically autonomous geographic area with a core, a periphery, and a hierarchical structure. These world-economies are dynamic, with their centers shifting over time, as seen in the successive dominance of cities like Venice, Antwerp, Genoa, and Amsterdam.\n\nWhile Braudel's primary focus was on these large-scale economic spheres, the idea could also be applied to the more contained geographical and political entity of a nation, which Morand referred to as a \"hexagon\" in the context of France. Braudel's adoption of this concept underscores his methodology of analyzing history on multiple scales, from the local to the global, and his interest in the spatial dimensions of historical processes. His work encourages a view of history not as a linear progression of events but as the interplay of interconnected systems and structures operating within defined, albeit evolving, spheres of influence.\n\n<<<world-economy>>>"
