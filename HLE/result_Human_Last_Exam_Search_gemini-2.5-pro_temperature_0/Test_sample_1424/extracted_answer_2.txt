In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 in energy-momentum space is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k). The functional form is typically expressed as G₀(ω, k) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ_k), where the poles of G_0 directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues.
