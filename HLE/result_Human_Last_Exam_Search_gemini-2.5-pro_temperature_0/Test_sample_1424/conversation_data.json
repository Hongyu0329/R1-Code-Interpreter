    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as G₀, exhibits a fundamental and direct functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship becomes most apparent when the Green's function is expressed in energy-momentum space.\n\nThe bare Green's function, also known as the free propagator, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. In the path integral formalism, it is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of two field operators. This can be calculated using a functional integral over all possible field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the free action.\n\nTo determine the explicit dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, one typically performs a Fourier transform of the Green's function from position and time to momentum and frequency (or energy). The path integral for a free theory, which involves a quadratic action, can be solved exactly. This procedure reveals that the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, G₀(ω, k), takes the following form for a fermionic system:\n\n***G₀(ω, k) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ_k)***\n\nHere:\n*   **ω** is the frequency, which corresponds to the energy of the particle.\n*   **k** is the momentum wavevector.\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalues, which describe the energy-momentum dispersion relation of the free particle (e.g., ϵ_k = ħ²k²/2m for a non-relativistic particle).\n*   **δ_k** is an infinitesimal term that ensures proper causal behavior. For particle propagation (ω > ϵ_F, where ϵ_F is the Fermi energy), δ_k is a small positive number (+iδ), and for hole propagation (ω < ϵ_F), it is a small negative number (-iδ). This is often written with a sign function as `iδ sign(ω - ϵ_F)`.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is that of an **inverse linear relationship in the energy variable ω**. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. This signifies that the particle can only propagate on-shell, that is, when its energy ω is equal to one of the allowed energy eigenvalues ϵ_k.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 in energy-momentum space is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k). The functional form is typically expressed as G₀(ω, k) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ_k), where the poles of G_0 directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues.>>>"
