    "This sequence does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. The key to solving this puzzle lies in recognizing that it is not a single sequence, but a representation of relationships between numbers, similar to a Collatz conjecture-like system, but with a different set of rules.\n\nThe sequence is generated by the following rules:\n*   If a number is a perfect square, the next number is its square root.\n*   If a number is a prime number, the next number is the next prime number in the sequence of primes.\n*   If a number is a composite number that is not a perfect square, the next number is its largest prime factor.\n*   However, there are also \"jumps\" in the sequence that do not follow these rules, suggesting an additional layer of complexity or a different mode of generation for certain terms.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence based on these potential rules. This is a complex sequence and the underlying pattern is not immediately obvious. After extensive analysis of the relationships between the numbers and exploring various mathematical and non-mathematical possibilities, a definitive, simple rule that governs the entire sequence is not apparent. The repetitions and seemingly random jumps suggest a complex or multi-layered rule set.\n\nHowever, if we focus on the tail end of the sequence: `..., 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`, a localized pattern seems to emerge. We see a block of three 36s followed by a block of three 124s, and then the sequence breaks into an alternation of a single 36 and a single 124.\n\nGiven this observation, the most plausible continuation of this localized pattern would be another alternation. Since the last term is 124, the next term would be 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
