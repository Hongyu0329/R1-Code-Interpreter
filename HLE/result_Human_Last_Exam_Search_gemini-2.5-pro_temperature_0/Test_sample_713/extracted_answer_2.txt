For $d=1$, the set of possible values is $\{V\}$. For $d \ge 2$, the set of possible values is an unbounded interval of the form $[C_d V, \infty)$, where $C_d$ is a constant depending only on the dimension $d$. The minimum value is achieved when the simplex $T$ is regular.
For $d=2$, the set is $[2\sqrt{3}V, \infty)$.
For $d=3$, the set is $[6V, \infty)$.
