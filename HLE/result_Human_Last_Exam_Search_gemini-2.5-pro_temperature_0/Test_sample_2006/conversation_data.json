    "The haiku describes the events leading to the death of Cleopatra. \"An August tempest\" refers to the turmoil surrounding her demise. \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" points to the year 30 BC, a pivotal moment that marked the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty and the beginning of Roman rule in Egypt. \"A divine one yields\" signifies Cleopatra, who was considered a goddess, surrendering to her fate.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" is a pun. It sounds like \"the baize,\" a green woolen cloth. This is a clue to the method of her death, as the asp, a venomous snake often depicted as green, was said to have been brought to her in a basket of figs.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in alphabetical order. The answer to the riddle is \"asp\". The letters of \"asp\" in alphabetical order are a, p, s.\n\n<<<a, p, s>>>"
