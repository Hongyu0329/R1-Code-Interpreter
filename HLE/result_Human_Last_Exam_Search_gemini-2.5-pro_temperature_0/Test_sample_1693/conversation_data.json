    "## French Tanker \"Monique\" Was Largest Ship Sunk by U-Boat Before 1940 Armistice\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a German U-boat before the Franco-German armistice in 1940 was the steam tanker **Monique**. The 7,011-ton vessel was torpedoed by the U-boat U-65 on June 22, 1940, in the Bay of Biscay.\n\nThe attack occurred on the very day the armistice was signed at Compi√®gne, which effectively ended the Battle of France. The *Monique*, laden with 10,000 tons of crude oil, was en route from Haifa to Le Havre when it was struck. The ship was engulfed in flames and broke in two before sinking.\n\nSeveral other French vessels were lost to U-boat attacks in the initial months of World War II. Among the larger ships was the steam merchant **Louisiane**, with a tonnage of 6,903 tons, which was sunk by U-48 on October 13, 1939. Another notable loss was the submarine **Doris**, though significantly smaller at 525-765 tons, sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940.\n\nHowever, with a displacement of 7,011 tons, the *Monique* stands as the largest French vessel to fall victim to a U-boat in the period before the 1940 armistice.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
