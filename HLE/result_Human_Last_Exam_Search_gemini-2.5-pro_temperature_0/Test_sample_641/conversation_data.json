    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is the sum of the sizes of its conjugacy classes of involutions. An involution in a group is an element of order 2. For PSU(4, 997), there are two such conjugacy classes.\n\nThe group in question is `G = PSU(n, q)` with `n=4` and `q=997`. The involutions in `G` are the images of elements `g` in the special unitary group `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2` is in the center of `SU(4, 997)`. The center of `SU(4, 997)` has order `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`, so it consists of `I` and `-I` (the identity matrix).\n\nThis gives rise to two types of involutions in PSU(4, 997):\n1.  Those that are images of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` with `g^2 = I`. These are true involutions in `SU(4, 997)`. In `SU(4, q)`, these elements form a single conjugacy class, and their number is given by the formula:\n    `N_1 = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n2.  Those that are images of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` with `g^2 = -I`. These are called pseudo-involutions. Since `q = 997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, these elements also form a single conjugacy class in `PSU(4, q)`. The number of such involutions is given by:\n    `N_2 = q^4 * (q^2 - 1) * (q^3 + 1)`\n\nThe total number of involutions is the sum `N = N_1 + N_2`.\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`:\n*   `N_1 = 997^4 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 1)`\n*   `N_2 = 997^4 * (997^2 - 1) * (997^3 + 1)`\n\nCalculating these values:\n*   `N_1 = 988053882081 * (994009 - 997 + 1) * (994009 + 1) = 988053882081 * 993013 * 994010 = 975275588191933301943130`\n*   `N_2 = 988053882081 * (994009 - 1) * (991026973 + 1) = 988053882081 * 994008 * 991026974 = 973321433340309185019952`\n\nTotal number of involutions:\n`N = 975,275,588,191,933,301,943,130 + 973,321,433,340,309,185,019,952 = 1,948,597,021,532,242,486,963,082`\n\nThus, the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is 1,948,597,021,532,242,486,963,082.\n\n<<<1948597021532242486963082>>>"
