    "When an icosahedron tank is standing on one of its faces, it rests on a triangular base. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, there is an identical triangular face at the top, parallel to the base.\n\nWhen the tank is half-filled with water, the water's surface will be a horizontal plane located at the midpoint of the tank's height. This plane will intersect the faces of the icosahedron, and the resulting cross-section will be a regular hexagon. This is because the plane at half the height cuts through the six faces that form the \"equator\" of the icosahedron when it is oriented on one of its faces.\n\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
