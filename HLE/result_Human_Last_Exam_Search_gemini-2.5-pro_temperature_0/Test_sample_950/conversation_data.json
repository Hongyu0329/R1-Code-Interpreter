    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **The Object of Study**: The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. We are interested in the torsion subgroup of its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Torsion Subgroup**: For any abelian group $A$, the torsion subgroup, denoted $A_T$, consists of all elements of $A$ that have finite order. The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each degree: $T = \\bigoplus_k \\text{Tors}(H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$. By definition, this resulting group $T$ is a torsion group, meaning every one of its elements has a finite order.\n\n3.  **Rank of an Abelian Group**: The rank of an abelian group $A$, sometimes called the torsion-free rank, is defined as the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset of $A$. An equivalent and often more practical definition is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Rank$(A) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n4.  **Rank of a Torsion Group**: If a group $A$ is a torsion group, then for any element $a \\in A$, there exists a non-zero integer $n$ such that $na = 0$. When we consider the tensor product $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$, any element can be written as $a \\otimes q$ for $a \\in A$ and $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We can write $q$ as $r/s$, but more usefully, for any $a$, we can write $a \\otimes q = a \\otimes (nq/n) = (na) \\otimes (q/n) = 0 \\otimes (q/n) = 0$. This shows that every element in $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is zero.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since the torsion subgroup is, by definition, a torsion group, its tensor product with $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the zero vector space. The dimension of the zero vector space is 0. Therefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 0.\n\nThe specific details about the cohomology of the Grassmannian $G(3, 5)$, such as the fact that its torsion is all 2-torsion, are not necessary to answer the question, which is a direct application of the definition of rank.\n\n<<<0>>>"
