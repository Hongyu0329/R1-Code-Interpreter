    "A standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. In a game where the objective is to place as many non-attacking bishops as possible on these squares, a maximum of 14 bishops can be placed. This leaves 14 edge squares without bishops.\n\nA bishop attacks any other piece along the same diagonal. The key to solving this puzzle lies in understanding that bishops on white squares can only attack other pieces on white squares, and bishops on dark squares can only attack those on dark squares. The 28 edge squares of a chessboard are evenly divided into 14 light-colored squares and 14 dark-colored squares.\n\nUpon analyzing the diagonals for the edge squares, it's found that the 28 squares form 14 pairs of squares that attack each other. For instance, the bishop on the corner square a1 attacks the corner square h8, as they lie on the same long diagonal. Similarly, the bishop on square a2 attacks the one on b1. Each of these attacking pairs consists of two squares of the same color.\n\nTo place the maximum number of bishops without any of them attacking each other, one can only place a single bishop from each of these 14 attacking pairs. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be positioned on the edge squares is 14.\n\nWith a total of 28 edge squares available and a maximum of 14 bishops placed, the number of edge squares that would remain empty is the difference between these two numbers.\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (maximum non-attacking bishops) = 14 (empty edge squares)\n\n<<<14>>>"
