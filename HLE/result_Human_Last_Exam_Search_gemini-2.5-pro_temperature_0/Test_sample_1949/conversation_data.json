    "### The Three Longest Rivers in Virgil's Aeneid\n\nThe epic Roman poem, the Aeneid, mentions several rivers, both real and mythological. Among the terrestrial rivers, three stand out for their significant lengths: the Don, the Aras, and the Hebrus.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Don River**, known in antiquity as the Tanais. Flowing through modern-day Russia, it stretches for approximately 1,870 kilometers (1,162 miles).\n\nThe second longest is the **Aras River**, referred to in the Aeneid by its classical name, the Araxes. This river flows through Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran, with a total length of 1,072 kilometers (666 miles).\n\nThe third longest is the **Hebrus River**, now known as the Maritsa. This river runs through Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey and has a length of about 480 to 530 kilometers (300 to 330 miles).\n\nOther rivers mentioned in the Aeneid include the Tiber, the main river of Rome, which is significantly shorter at approximately 405 kilometers (252 miles). The Pactolus River in modern-day Turkey is even smaller, with a length of about 25 kilometers. The poem also famously features the mythological rivers of the underworld, such as the Styx, Acheron, Lethe, Cocytus, and Phlegethon, which do not have real-world geographical lengths.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Don (Tanais), the Aras (Araxes), and the Hebrus (Maritsa).>>>"
