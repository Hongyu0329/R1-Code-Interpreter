The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the Berezin integration rules: for a single Grassmann variable \( \theta \), the integral of a constant is zero ( \( \int d\theta = 0 \) ) and the integral of the variable itself is one ( \( \int d\theta \, \theta = 1 \) ). These rules, built upon the anti-commuting nature of Grassmann variables ( \( \theta_i \theta_j = -\theta_j \theta_i \) ) and their nilpotency ( \( \theta^2 = 0 \) ), ensure the Pauli exclusion principle is maintained in the path integral formalism.
