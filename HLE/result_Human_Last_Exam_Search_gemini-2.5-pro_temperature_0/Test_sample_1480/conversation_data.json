    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system, the activation level of a rule is calculated by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership degree of the rule's consequent. The firing strength is given by `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the membership degree of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic. Common t-norm operations include the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\n*   **Using the Minimum T-norm:** This is the most common t-norm, also known as the Gödel t-norm. It takes the minimum of the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n*   **Using the Product T-norm:** This t-norm calculates the product of the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not defined in the question, and the minimum operator is the most frequently used t-norm in fuzzy logic applications, it is the standard choice.\n\nTherefore, using the minimum t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
