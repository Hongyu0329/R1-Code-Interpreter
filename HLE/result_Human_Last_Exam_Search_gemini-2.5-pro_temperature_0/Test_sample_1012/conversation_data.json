    "To remain secure against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be sufficiently long to withstand a brute-force attack that is quadratically faster than a classical one. This is due to Grover's algorithm, a quantum algorithm that can search an unsorted database, such as a key space, with a square root speedup over classical computers.\n\nThe primary defense against such quantum attacks on symmetric ciphers is to increase the key size. Grover's algorithm effectively halves the security level, or \"bit strength,\" of a symmetric key. For example, a 128-bit key, which is considered secure against classical computers, would only offer 64 bits of security against a quantum computer, which is not considered safe for long-term protection.\n\nTo achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum computer—a level widely considered to be secure for the foreseeable future—it is necessary to use a symmetric key of 256 bits. An attack on a 256-bit key using Grover's algorithm would require approximately 2^128 operations, which is currently deemed computationally infeasible.\n\nOrganizations like the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommend using 256-bit keys for symmetric encryption, such as AES-256, to ensure protection against quantum threats. While NIST has not mandated an immediate transition for all applications, they acknowledge that for long-term security, especially for classified data, 256-bit keys are required.\n\nTherefore, to be secure against an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key should be at least 256 bits long.\n\n<<<A>>>"
