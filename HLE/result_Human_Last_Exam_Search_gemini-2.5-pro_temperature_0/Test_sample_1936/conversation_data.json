    "To determine the smallest number $n$ for which a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation is not a group, we must examine sets of increasing size.\n\nA group is a set combined with an operation that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse element. A binary operation on a set by definition satisfies the closure property.\n\n*   **n = 0**: The set is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. A group requires the existence of an identity element, which the empty set does not have. Therefore, the empty set with its only possible binary operation (the empty function) is not a group. However, in the context of group theory, the order of a group is typically a positive integer, as groups must be non-empty.\n\n*   **n = 1**: Let $G = \\{e\\}$. The only possible binary operation on this set is $e \\cdot e = e$. Let's check the group axioms:\n    *   **Closure**: $e \\cdot e = e$, which is in $G$. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Associativity**: $(e \\cdot e) \\cdot e = e \\cdot (e \\cdot e)$, which simplifies to $e \\cdot e = e \\cdot e$. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Identity Element**: $e$ acts as the identity because $e \\cdot e = e$. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Inverse Element**: The inverse of $e$ is $e$ itself, since $e \\cdot e = e$. This is satisfied.\n    Since all axioms are satisfied, any set with one element under any binary operation must be a group, often called the trivial group. It is impossible for a one-element set with a binary operation to *not* be a group.\n\n*   **n = 2**: Let $G = \\{a, b\\}$. We need to see if we can define a binary operation that fails at least one of the group axioms. There are $2^{(2^2)} = 16$ possible binary operations on a set of two elements. We only need to find one that does not form a group.\n    Consider the following operation defined by the table below:\n| â‹… | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| **a** | a | a |\n| **b** | a | a |\n\n    Let's check the group axioms for $(G, \\cdot)$:\n    *   **Closure**: All results in the table (`a`) are elements of $G$. The closure property holds.\n    *   **Associativity**: The operation is associative. For any three elements $x, y, z \\in G$, $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = a \\cdot z = a$, and $x \\cdot (y \\cdot z) = x \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   **Identity Element**: An identity element $e$ must satisfy $e \\cdot x = x$ for all $x \\in G$.\n        *   If we test $a$ as the identity: $a \\cdot b = a$, which is not equal to $b$. So, $a$ is not the identity element.\n        *   If we test $b$ as the identity: $b \\cdot a = a$, which is not equal to $b$. So, $b$ is not the identity element.\n    Since there is no identity element, this structure is not a group.\n\nBecause a set of size 1 must always form a group, and we have constructed an example of a set of size 2 with a binary operation that is not a group, the smallest such positive integer $n$ is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
