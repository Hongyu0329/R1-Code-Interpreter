The analytical expression for the overlap integral, \(S\), between two normalized 2s hydrogenic orbitals as a function of the internuclear distance \(R\) and the effective nuclear charge \(\zeta\) is given by:
\(S(p) = e^{-p} \left(1 + p + \frac{p^2}{3} - \frac{p^4}{6} - \frac{p^5}{15}\right)\)
where \(p = \frac{\zeta R}{2a_0}\). In atomic units, \(a_0=1\), so \(p = \frac{\zeta R}{2}\).
