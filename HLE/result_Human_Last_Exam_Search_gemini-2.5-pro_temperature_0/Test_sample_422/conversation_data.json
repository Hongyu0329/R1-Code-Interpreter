    "Assuming the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, and limiting our epistemic states to only Knowledge and Belief, two significant problems arise that are independent of Gettier-style cases. These problems challenge the coherence and applicability of the \"Justification\" component of the definition.\n\nHere are the two problems the JTB definition runs into:\n\n### 1. The Infinite Regress of Justification (Agrippa's Trilemma)\n\nThe first major issue is that the \"Justification\" requirement is fundamentally unstable. For any belief to be considered knowledge, it must be justified. However, the justification itself, being a proposition, must also be justified. This creates a chain of justifications that results in a logical trilemma, where each option is problematic for establishing knowledge:\n\n*   **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justifications goes on forever, with each reason needing another reason to support it. Since a person cannot complete an infinite chain of reasoning, no belief can ever be ultimately justified.\n*   **Dogmatic Assumption:** The chain of justifications stops at a \"basic belief\" that is asserted without its own justification. This move is arbitrary and violates the core requirement that knowledge must be justified.\n*   **Circular Reasoning:** The chain of justifications eventually loops back on itself. For example, proposition A is justified by B, which is justified by C, which is in turn justified by A. This form of reasoning is fallacious and cannot ground knowledge.\n\nThis trilemma suggests that the very concept of justification as a requirement for knowledge is problematic, as it seems impossible to ever fully satisfy it without resorting to infinite chains, arbitrary stops, or circular logic.\n\n### 2. The Ambiguity of \"Sufficient\" Justification\n\nThe second problem is that the JTB definition fails to specify the *quality* or *strength* of justification required to turn a true belief into knowledge. This leads to a dilemma concerning whether the standard for justification should be fallible or infallible.\n\n*   **If Justification Must Be Infallible:** This view, known as infallibilism, states that for a belief to be knowledge, its justification must guarantee its truth. This sets an impossibly high standard for knowledge, as very few beliefs—outside of logical tautologies—can be justified in a way that makes error impossible. This would mean we have almost no knowledge at all. Furthermore, if a justification already guarantees the belief's truth, the separate \"True\" condition in the JTB definition becomes redundant.\n*   **If Justification Can Be Fallible:** This view, known as fallibilism, accepts that a belief can be knowledge even if the justification is not absolutely certain. While this aligns better with our everyday experience, it creates a critical problem: the JTB definition provides no clear threshold for how much justification is *enough*. Is 95% certainty sufficient? 99%? Without a clear standard, the distinction between a \"justified true belief\" that is merely a lucky belief and one that qualifies as \"knowledge\" becomes vague and arbitrary.\n\nGiven only the epistemic states of \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" this ambiguity is particularly damaging. If our justification is fallible, we possess a \"Justified Belief.\" However, the JTB framework offers no principle to determine at what point that justification becomes strong enough to elevate the belief to the status of \"Knowledge.\"\n\n<<<The two problems the JTB definition runs into, ignoring Gettier problems, are the **Infinite Regress of Justification (Agrippa's Trilemma)**, which questions how any belief can be fundamentally justified, and the **Problem of Defining the Strength of Justification**, which highlights the ambiguity over whether justification must be infallible (making knowledge nearly impossible) or fallible (making the threshold for knowledge unclear and arbitrary).>>>"
