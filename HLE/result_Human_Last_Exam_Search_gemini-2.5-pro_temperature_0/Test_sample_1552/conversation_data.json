    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is denoted as `a₂`. To find this coefficient, one considers the square of the Dirac operator, `D²`, which is a Laplace-type operator. The heat kernel of `D²` has an asymptotic expansion for small `t`:\n\n`Tr(e^{-tD²}) \\sim \\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^{d/2}} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n(D²) t^n`\n\nwhere `d` is the dimension of the spacetime manifold. The coefficients `a_n` are known as the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients. The spectral action itself is a sum over these coefficients.\n\nThe square of the massless gauged Dirac operator, `D = \\gamma^\\mu (\\partial_\\mu + \\omega_\\mu + A_\\mu)`, is given by the Lichnerowicz formula:\n\n`D² = \\nabla^\\mu \\nabla_\\mu + \\frac{1}{4}R - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}`\n\nHere, `\\nabla_\\mu` is the covariant derivative acting on spinors (which includes the spin connection `\\omega_\\mu` and the gauge connection `A_\\mu`), `R` is the scalar curvature of the manifold, `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the field strength of the gauge field, and `\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma^\\mu, \\gamma^\\nu]`.\n\nThe operator `D²` is a generalized Laplacian of the form `\\nabla^2 + E`, where the endomorphism `E` is given by:\n\n`E = \\frac{1}{4}R - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}`\n\nThe second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, `a₂`, is a local geometric invariant constructed from the curvature of the manifold and the gauge field strength. For a general second-order differential operator of the form `\\nabla^2 + E` acting on a vector bundle over a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the trace of the `a₂` coefficient density is given by a standard formula. By substituting the specific form of the endomorphism `E` for the squared Dirac operator and the curvature of the connection, and then performing the trace over the spinor indices, one obtains the final expression for `a₂`.\n\nThe calculation is intricate and depends on the conventions used for curvature tensors and gamma matrices. However, the result is well-established in the physics and mathematics literature.\n\nThe trace of the second heat kernel coefficient density, `a₂(x)`, for a massless Dirac spinor field in four dimensions is:\n\n`tr_{spinor}(a_2(x)) = d_s \\left( \\frac{1}{12} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{240} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{1}{240} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{144} R^2 \\right)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `d_s` is the dimension of the spinor representation (which is 4 for Dirac spinors in 4 dimensions).\n*   `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the gauge field strength tensor.\n*   `R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}` is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n*   `R_{\\mu\\nu}` is the Ricci curvature tensor.\n*   `R` is the Ricci scalar.\n\nThe full coefficient `a₂` for the spectral action is the integral of this density over the manifold:\n\n`a_2(D^2) = \\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} \\, \\text{tr}_{spinor}(a_2(x))`\n\n<<<`\\text{tr}_{spinor}(a_2(x)) = d_s \\left( \\frac{1}{12} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{240} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{1}{240} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{144} R^2 \\right)`>>>"
