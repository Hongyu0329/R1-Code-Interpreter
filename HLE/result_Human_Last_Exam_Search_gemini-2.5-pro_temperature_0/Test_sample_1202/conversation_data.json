    "When a gene is duplicated, there are several possible outcomes. The most common fate is that one copy becomes non-functional and is lost, a process called pseudogenization. However, several mechanisms can lead to the retention and subsequent divergence of both copies.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the likely mechanisms:\n*   **Subfunctionalization:** In this scenario, the ancestral gene had multiple functions (or was expressed in multiple tissues). After duplication, each copy loses a different subset of the original functions through mutation. As a result, both copies are now required to carry out the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally performed. This \"division of labor\" provides an immediate reason for both genes to be preserved from being lost. This is considered a neutral process because it doesn't require a rare, new beneficial function to arise.\n*   **Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one of the duplicated genes retains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new function. This is an adaptive process, as the new function must be beneficial to be selected for and preserved in the population.\n*   **Gene Conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer where one sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. This mechanism works to homogenize duplicated genes, preventing their divergence. Therefore, it does not explain the divergence of duplicate genes.\n*   **Pseudogenization:** This is the most frequent outcome of gene duplication, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene. While it is a major fate, it represents the *loss* of a duplicate, not its retention and divergence.\n*   **Adaptive Radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species. It is not a molecular mechanism that acts on genes.\n\n**Comparison of Mechanisms:**\n\nBoth subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely initial mechanism for preserving both copies. This is because it provides a passive, neutral route for retention; the partitioning of functions makes both copies essential without needing to wait for a rare, advantageous new function to evolve, which is required for neofunctionalization.\n\nSome models suggest that subfunctionalization can act as a transitional state, preserving both gene copies for a long enough period that one of them has the opportunity to eventually evolve a new function (neofunctionalization).\n\nGiven the choices, subfunctionalization provides the most robust and likely explanation for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicated genes because it immediately resolves the issue of redundancy, protecting both copies from being lost to pseudogenization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
