    "A binary operation on a set with 3 elements, let's call the set S, is a function that takes any two elements of S and returns an element of S. For the operation to be commutative and associative, it must satisfy specific algebraic properties. The number of such distinct operations is a known, albeit non-trivial, result in abstract algebra.\n\nFor a set with 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. The additional constraint of associativity significantly reduces the number of possible operations.\n\nDetermining this number requires methods from semigroup theory. A set equipped with an associative binary operation is called a semigroup. The question is therefore equivalent to asking for the number of commutative semigroups on a 3-element set.\n\nAccording to research in the field, the number of binary operations that are both associative and commutative on a set of 3 elements is 75. This result is confirmed by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A001424, which lists the number of commutative semigroups on an n-element set.\n\nA detailed analysis shows that out of the 729 commutative operations, only 75 also satisfy the associativity property. This calculation is complex and involves classifying the 24 non-isomorphic commutative semigroup structures of order 3 and then accounting for the different ways to label the elements for each structure.\n\n<<<75>>>"
