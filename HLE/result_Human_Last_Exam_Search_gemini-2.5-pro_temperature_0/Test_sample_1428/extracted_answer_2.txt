The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is given by $P_{t+1}(i) = \frac{1}{2} P_t(i-1) + \frac{1}{2} P_t(i+1)$, where indices are modulo N. The transition probability matrix is a circulant matrix with $A_{i, i-1} = A_{i, i+1} = 1/2$ (indices mod N) and other entries being zero. The eigenvectors are indeed $e^{ijk_n}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_n = \cos(k_n) = \cos(2\pi n/N)$. The rate of relaxation is determined by the second-largest eigenvalue, which is $\lambda_1 = \cos(2\pi/N)$.
