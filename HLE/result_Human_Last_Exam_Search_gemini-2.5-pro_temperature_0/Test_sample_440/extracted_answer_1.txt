The density profile \(\rho(z)\) is determined by the solution to the coupled equations for the number densities \(n_A(z)\) and \(n_B(z)\) based on the principle of constant chemical potential for each species in a gravitational field, incorporating the van der Waals interactions. The final mass density is \(\rho(z) = m_A n_A(z) + m_B n_B(z)\), where \(n_A(z)\) and \(n_B(z)\) are defined by the system of equations:
For Gas A: \( k_B T \ln\left(\frac{n_A(z)}{1 - n_A(z)b'_{AA} - n_B(z)b'_{BB}}\right) + \frac{k_B T b'_{AA} (n_A(z) + n_B(z))}{1 - n_A(z)b'_{AA} - n_B(z)b'_{BB}} - 2(n_A(z)a'_{AA} + n_B(z)a'_{AB}) + m_A g z = C_A \)
For Gas B: \( k_B T \ln\left(\frac{n_B(z)}{1 - n_A(z)b'_{AA} - n_B(z)b'_{BB}}\right) + \frac{k_B T b'_{BB} (n_A(z) + n_B(z))}{1 - n_A(z)b'_{AA} - n_B(z)b'_{BB}} - 2(n_A(z)a'_{AB} + n_B(z)a'_{BB}) + m_B g z = C_B \)
The constants \(C_A\) and \(C_B\) are determined by the normalization conditions \(A \int_0^H n_A(z) \,dz = N_A\) and \(A \int_0^H n_B(z) \,dz = N_B\).
