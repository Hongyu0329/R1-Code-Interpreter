    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid and the formation of the hydroxo complex, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\n1.  **Relevant Equilibria:**\n    *   The dissolution of aluminum hydroxide:\n        Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n    *   The formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion:\n        Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n    *   The autoionization of water:\n        H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n        K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n2.  **Total Solubility (S):**\n    The total molar solubility of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **Charge Balance Equation:**\n    For any solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n4.  **Solving for an Unknown:**\n    We can express each concentration in the charge balance equation in terms of [OH⁻]:\n    *   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n    *   From K_f and K_sp: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]\n    *   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\n    Substituting these into the charge balance equation:\n    3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])\n\n    Multiplying the entire equation by [OH⁻]³ to clear the denominator gives:\n    3K_sp + K_w[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]⁴\n    3K_sp + K_w[OH⁻]² = (1 + K_sp * K_f)[OH⁻]⁴\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    Now, we substitute the given values:\n    *   K_sp = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n    *   K_f = 1.1 x 10³¹\n    *   K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n    *   K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    3(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) + (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² = (1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴\n    1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ + (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² ≈ (5.83 x 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴\n\n    Given the small value of K_sp and the expected [OH⁻] concentration (around 10⁻⁷ M or slightly different), the term K_w[OH⁻]² (approx. 10⁻¹⁴ * (10⁻⁸)² = 10⁻³⁰) is negligible compared to 3K_sp (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶). We can simplify the equation:\n    1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ ≈ (5.83 x 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴\n\n    Now, we solve for [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻]⁴ ≈ (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) / (5.83 x 10⁴) ≈ 2.73 x 10⁻³¹\n    [OH⁻] ≈ (2.73 x 10⁻³¹)¹ᐟ⁴ ≈ 2.28 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n6.  **Determine Species Concentrations and Total Solubility:**\n    With the concentration of [OH⁻], we can find the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n    *   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.47 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n    *   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.28 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n    The total solubility S is the sum of these concentrations:\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.47 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³)\n    S = 0.000447 + 0.00133 = 0.001777 mol L⁻¹\n\nThe solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is approximately 1.78 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.78e-3>>>"
