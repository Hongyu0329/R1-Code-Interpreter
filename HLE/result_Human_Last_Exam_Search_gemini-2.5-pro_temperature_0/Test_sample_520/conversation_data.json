    "I am unable to find any information about a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault who was suspected of being a German spy in the UK during World War II because he concealed his true profession. Extensive searches for this individual and the specific circumstances described have not yielded any relevant results.\n\nIt is possible that the name is misspelled, the details of the story have been altered over time, or the case is not documented in publicly available records. Historical accounts of counterintelligence operations during World War II, particularly those involving MI5, often remain classified for extended periods, and not all individual cases have been made public.\n\nWhile there are records of Belgian refugees being interrogated in the United Kingdom during the war, and general accounts of counter-espionage activities, the specific story of Andre Vernault and his concealed profession does not appear in the sources I have access to.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide an answer to your question.\n\n<<<I am unable to find the answer to your question.>>>"
