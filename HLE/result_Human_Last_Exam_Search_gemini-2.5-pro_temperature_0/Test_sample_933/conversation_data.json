    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly and efficiently achieved by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. According to multiple sources, the standard and optimal temperature for this direct reaction is approximately 400°C.\n\nThe process typically involves reacting xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container at 400°C. The reaction is exothermic and yields solid, colorless crystals of XeF₄. A patent for this process specifies a temperature range between 350°C and 450°C, with 400°C being the preferable temperature for a quantitative reaction.\n\nWhile other synthesis methods exist, such as using an electric discharge or photochemical irradiation, these are often used to produce Xenon difluoride (XeF₂) or result in product mixtures. For instance, passing an electric discharge through a xenon and fluorine mixture at low temperatures can produce XeF₄, but it is contaminated with XeF₂. The direct heating method at 400°C is consistently cited as the primary and efficient way to produce Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\nBased on the provided options, 400°C is the coldest temperature listed at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently through its most common synthesis method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
