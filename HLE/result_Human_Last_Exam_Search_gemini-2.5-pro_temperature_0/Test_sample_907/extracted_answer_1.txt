**a) No interaction:**
The absorption cross-section per molecule is given by:
σₐ(ω) = (√(π)τ ω_ex / (3ħcε₀)) |μ_mol|² exp(-(ω_ex - ω)²τ²)
where:
*   ω is the central frequency of the laser pulse.
*   τ is the pulse duration.
*   ω_ex is the transition frequency of a single molecule.
*   **μ**_mol is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
*   ħ, c, and ε₀ are fundamental constants.
The spectrum consists of a single Gaussian peak at the monomer frequency ω_ex.

**b) Near-neighbor interaction:**
The absorption cross-section per molecule is given by:
σₑ(ω) = (√(π)τ ω_k=0 / (3ħcε₀)) |μ_mol|² exp(-(ω_k=0 - ω)²τ²)
where:
*   ω_k=0 = (E_ex + 2J)/ħ is the transition frequency of the k=0 exciton state.
*   E_ex is the single-molecule excitation energy.
*   J is the near-neighbor coupling integral.
The spectrum is a single Gaussian peak shifted to the frequency of the k=0 exciton state. The interaction concentrates the oscillator strength into this single state and shifts its energy.
