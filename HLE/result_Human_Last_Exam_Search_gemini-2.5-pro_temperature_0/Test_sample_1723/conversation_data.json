    "There is no single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print. While several mushroom species exhibit blue coloration in their caps or flesh, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nFor instance, the strikingly blue *Entoloma hochstetteri* from New Zealand has a reddish-pink spore print. The Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*), another vibrant blue mushroom, produces a cream-colored spore print. Similarly, the Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*) has a purple-black to purplish-brown spore print. Various blue-hued species within the large *Cortinarius* genus are characterized by a rusty-brown spore print.\n\nSpore print color is a crucial characteristic for mushroom identification and typically ranges from white, cream, and yellow to pink, brown, and black. Green spore prints, such as that of the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, are considered a rare feature among mushrooms. The available scientific literature and mycological resources do not indicate the existence of a mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
