    "When two Chern insulators with Chern numbers C₁ and C₂ are brought together to form a junction, the number of topologically protected chiral edge states at the interface is given by the difference between their Chern numbers, |C₁ - C₂|.\n\nIn this specific case, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of 1. Therefore, C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1.\n\nThe number of chiral edge states at the junction is:\n|C₁ - C₂| = |1 - 1| = 0\n\nThis means that the junction between the two identical Chern insulators is topologically trivial and does not host any conducting edge states. The two materials effectively merge into a single, larger Chern insulator that has the same Chern number, C=1. While a junction itself, being a one-dimensional interface, does not have a bulk Chern number, its topological character is described by the number of conducting channels it supports.\n\nTherefore, the effective Chern number of the junction is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
