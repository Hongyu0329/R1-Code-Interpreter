    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community and related fields of condensed matter physics and materials science. It is often denoted as S(q, ω), where q is the wave vector (the Fourier variable corresponding to space) and ω is the angular frequency (the Fourier variable corresponding to time).\n\nThe dynamic structure factor provides information about the collective dynamics of particles in a system, describing how the system scatters radiation (like neutrons or X-rays) with a certain momentum and energy transfer. In the context of nuclear criticality, understanding neutron scattering is fundamental, and the dynamic structure factor is a key quantity in the analysis of neutron transport and thermal neutron scattering laws.\n\nSpecifically, the dynamic structure factor is the double Fourier transform of the time-dependent pair-correlation function, G(r, t). This relationship is crucial for interpreting data from inelastic scattering experiments, which directly probe the dynamic structure factor of materials. While the term \"static structure factor,\" S(q), refers to the Fourier transform of the pair correlation function at a single point in time (t=0), the dynamic structure factor, S(q, ω), encompasses the time evolution of the system's structure.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
