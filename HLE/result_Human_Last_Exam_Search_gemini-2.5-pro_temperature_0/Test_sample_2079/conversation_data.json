    "I am unable to definitively identify the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461.\n\nHistorical records confirm the existence of the office of town judge (in Slovak: *richtár*) in Bardejov during this period. Correspondence from the time was addressed to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa,\" indicating a functioning town council.\n\nThe most comprehensive source for this information is the book \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by historian Mária Fedorčáková. This work is based on the well-preserved medieval archives of Bardejov and reportedly contains lists of town officials, including the annually elected judges. However, access to a digital copy or a detailed excerpt of this book that would contain the specific name of the judge for 1461 is not available through the performed searches.\n\nWhile general information about Bardejov's administration in the 15th century is accessible, the name of the individual holding the position of judge in 1461 remains elusive without consulting the specific lists within specialized historical publications like Fedorčáková's monograph.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the answer.>>>"
