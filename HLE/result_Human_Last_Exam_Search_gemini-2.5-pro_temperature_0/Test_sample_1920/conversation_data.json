    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$, we first need to determine the prime factorization of the conductor $d$.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $d = 53599$. A quick calculation shows that:\n$d = 53599 = 13 \\times 4123$\nFurther factorization reveals that $4123$ is a prime number. Thus, the prime factorization of $d$ is $13 \\times 4123$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group of integers modulo $d$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, to the complex numbers. Due to the factorization of $d$, the group of characters modulo $d$ is isomorphic to the product of the character groups for each prime factor:\n$G_{53599} \\cong G_{13} \\times G_{4123}$\n\nA character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2$, where $\\chi_1$ is a character modulo $13$ and $\\chi_2$ is a character modulo $4123$. For $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d = 13 \\times 4123$, each of its component characters $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$ must be primitive characters of their respective moduli.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters, $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2))$. We require this order to be $6$. This imposes conditions on the orders of $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$. The possible orders for $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$ must be divisors of 6. The combinations of orders $(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2))$ that result in an lcm of 6 are:\n*   (1, 6)\n*   (2, 3)\n*   (2, 6)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (3, 6)\n*   (6, 1)\n*   (6, 2)\n*   (6, 3)\n*   (6, 6)\n\nNext, we need to find the number of primitive characters of a specific order for each prime modulus. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$, $G_p$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. In a cyclic group of order $n$, the number of elements of order $k$ (where $k$ divides $n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$. All non-trivial characters modulo a prime are primitive.\n\nFor the modulus $p_1 = 13$:\nThe order of the character group is $\\phi(13) = 12$. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The number of primitive characters of a given order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$:\n*   Order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$ (the trivial character, which is not primitive)\n*   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\nFor the modulus $p_2 = 4123$:\nThe order of the character group is $\\phi(4123) = 4122$. We check if 2 and 3 are divisors of 4122:\n$4122 = 2 \\times 2061$\nThe sum of the digits of 2061 is $2+0+6+1=9$, which is divisible by 3, so 2061 is divisible by 3.\n$2061 = 3 \\times 687$. The sum of the digits of 687 is $6+8+7=21$, which is divisible by 3, so 687 is divisible by 3.\n$687 = 3 \\times 229$. 229 is a prime number.\nSo, $4122 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 229$.\nSince 2 and 3 are divisors of 4122, there exist primitive characters of orders 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is:\n*   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\nLet $N(k_1, k_2)$ be the number of pairs of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$ with orders $(k_1, k_2)$. The total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the sum of $N(k_1, k_2)$ over all pairs $(k_1, k_2)$ where $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2) = 6$.\n\n*   $N(2, 3) = \\phi(2) \\times \\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$\n*   $N(3, 2) = \\phi(3) \\times \\phi(2) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$\n*   $N(3, 6) = \\phi(3) \\times \\phi(6) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n*   $N(6, 3) = \\phi(6) \\times \\phi(3) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n*   $N(2, 6) = \\phi(2) \\times \\phi(6) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$\n*   $N(6, 2) = \\phi(6) \\times \\phi(2) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$\n*   $N(6, 6) = \\phi(6) \\times \\phi(6) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n\nThe cases involving order 1 for one of the characters are excluded because the character of order 1 is not primitive.\n\nSumming these up gives the total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6:\nTotal = $2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 20$.\n\n"
