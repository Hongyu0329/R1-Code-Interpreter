    "The minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 3.\n\nHere is a summary of the derivation:\n1.  **The Knot and the Manifold:** The object of study is a 4-dimensional manifold, which we will call $M$. It is constructed as the double branched cover of the 4-sphere, $S^4$, where the branching occurs over a specific knotted surface: the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot.\n\n2.  **Fundamental Group of the Complement:** The first step is to determine the fundamental group of the complement of this knotted surface in $S^4$, which we denote as $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus T_5(K))$. Building on the work of E. C. Zeeman, this group has a known presentation. Let $G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$ be the group of the trefoil knot $K$. The group of the complement of its 5-twist-spun version is given by:\n    $\\pi = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=b^3, tat^{-1}=a, tbt^{-1}=a^5ba^{-5} \\rangle$.\n    In this presentation, the relation $tat^{-1}=a$ indicates that the generator $t$ commutes with $a$.\n\n3.  **Fundamental Group of the Branched Cover:** For a double branched cover of $S^4$ over a suitable surface, the fundamental group of the resulting manifold $M$ can be found by taking the fundamental group of the complement and adding a relation. Specifically, one quotients the group $\\pi$ by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian element, $\\mu^2=1$. For a twist-spun knot, the meridians correspond to the generators of the original knot group, such as $a$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Group Presentation:** We add the relation $a^2=1$ to the presentation of $\\pi$.\n    *   The relation $a^2=b^3$ immediately implies $1=b^3$.\n    *   The relation $tbt^{-1}=a^5ba^{-5}$ simplifies. Since $a^2=1$, we have $a^5 = (a^2)^2 a = a$ and $a^{-1}=a$. The relation becomes $tbt^{-1}=aba$.\n    The resulting presentation for the fundamental group of $M$, let's call it $\\Gamma = \\pi_1(M)$, is:\n    $\\Gamma = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=1, b^3=1, ta=at, tbt^{-1}=aba \\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Minimal Number of Generators:** To find the minimal number of generators for $\\Gamma$, we can examine its abelianization, $\\Gamma^{ab}$. The abelianization is obtained by adding relations that make all generators commute.\n    *   The relation $tbt^{-1}=aba$ becomes $b=aba$. In an abelian group, this simplifies to $b=b+2a$, which means $2a=0$.\n    *   The other relations are $a^2=1$ (which is consistent with $2a=0$) and $b^3=1$.\n    The abelianization is $\\Gamma^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the images of $a, b,$ and $t$. This group requires three generators. The number of generators of a group must be at least the number of generators of its abelianization. Therefore, $\\Gamma$ requires at least 3 generators. Since we have a generating set $\\{a, b, t\\}$ of size 3, the minimal number of generators is exactly 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
