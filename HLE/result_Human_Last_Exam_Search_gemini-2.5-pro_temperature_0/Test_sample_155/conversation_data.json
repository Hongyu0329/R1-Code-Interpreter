    "The word encoded in the `verbatim` environment is **final**.\n\nThe puzzle uses a form of ASCII art where the letters 't' and 'b' are used to draw the shapes of larger letters. The word is formed by interpreting these shapes.\n\n*   **F**: The first letter is an 'F', primarily formed by the 't' characters on the left side of the arrangement.\n*   **i**: The letter 'i' is represented by the vertical column of 't's towards the right.\n*   **n, a, l**: The remaining letters 'n', 'a', and 'l' are formed by the other 't' characters, in a more stylized or abstract manner.\n\nThe word \"final\" is also a meta-reference, often used in the context of puzzles and answers.\n\n<<<final>>>"
