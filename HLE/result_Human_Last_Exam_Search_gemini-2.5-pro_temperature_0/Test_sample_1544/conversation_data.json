    "In the provided chess position, White's optimal move is clear and decisive. The board state is represented by the FEN string: 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1.\n\nWhite's key advantage is the powerful passed pawn on d6. This pawn is a significant threat to Black, and its advance is currently hindered only by Black's queen on c5. Therefore, White's primary objective should be to remove this blockade.\n\nThe most effective move for White is:\n\n**Qxc5+**\n\nThis move forces an exchange of queens, as Black's only legal response is to recapture with the king (...Kxc5). Following this exchange, White's d-pawn becomes unstoppable. The sequence of moves would be:\n\n1.  **Qxc5+ Kxc5**\n2.  **d7**\n\nAt this point, Black's king is too far away to prevent the pawn from promoting to a new queen on the next move. Black's own passed pawn on the a-file is not a sufficient counter-threat, as White's king can easily intercept it after the d-pawn has been promoted. This sequence leads to a winning endgame for White.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
