    "Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred in what is now **Lạng Sơn Province** in Vietnam.\n\nThis defeat took place during the Battle of Chi Lăng in 1427. The battle was a significant victory for the Vietnamese forces led by Lê Lợi and a major setback for the Ming Dynasty army. The engagement was part of the larger Lam Sơn uprising against Ming rule.\n\nThe battle occurred in the Chi Lăng Pass, located in the Chi Lăng District of Lạng Sơn Province. While Liu Sheng was the commander-in-chief of the Ming forces and was killed in the battle, Mu Sheng was also a commander of the Ming army at the time. The defeat at Chi Lăng was a pivotal event that contributed to the eventual withdrawal of Ming forces from Vietnam.\n\n<<<Lạng Sơn Province>>>"
