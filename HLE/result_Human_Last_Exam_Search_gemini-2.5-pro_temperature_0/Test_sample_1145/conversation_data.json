    "To find the probability that the particle in a 1D box is located in an interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n = 2, we need to evaluate the integral of the probability density function over this interval.\n\n1.  **The Wavefunction and Probability Density**\n    The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\n    ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\n    For the n=2 state, the wavefunction is:\n    ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\n    The probability density, P(x), is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\n2.  **Setting up the Probability Integral**\n    The probability of finding the particle in the interval [x₁, x₂] is given by the integral:\n    Prob(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[x₁, x₂] P(x) dx\n\n    In this case, x₁ = 0.495a and x₂ = 0.505a. So, we need to calculate:\n    Prob = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n3.  **Approximation for a Small Interval around a Node**\n    The interval Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a is very small. It is centered around x = 0.5a, which is a node for the n=2 state (since sin(2π(0.5a)/a) = sin(π) = 0).\n\n    Because the interval is small, we can approximate the `sin` function. Let's define a new variable δx = x - 0.5a. The integration interval for δx is from -0.005a to 0.005a.\n    The argument of the sine function becomes:\n    2πx/a = 2π(0.5a + δx)/a = π + 2πδx/a\n\n    Using the identity sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ), we get:\n    sin(2πx/a) = sin(π + 2πδx/a) = -sin(2πδx/a)\n\n    For small values of θ, sin(θ) ≈ θ. Therefore:\n    sin(2πδx/a) ≈ 2πδx/a\n\n    Substituting this back into the probability density:\n    P(x) ≈ (2/a) * (-2πδx/a)² = (2/a) * (4π²(δx)²/a²) = (8π²/a³) * (δx)²\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Integral**\n    Now we can integrate this simplified expression with respect to δx over the interval [-0.005a, 0.005a]:\n    Prob ≈ ∫[-0.005a, 0.005a] (8π²/a³) * (δx)² d(δx)\n\n    Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ (δx)³/3 ] from -0.005a to 0.005a\n    Prob ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [ (0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³ ]\n    Prob ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [ 2 * (0.005a)³ ]\n    Prob ≈ (16π²/3a³) * (0.005)³ * a³\n    Prob ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.000000125)\n    Prob ≈ (16 * (3.14159)² / 3) * 1.25 x 10⁻⁷\n    Prob ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 1.25 x 10⁻⁷\n    Prob ≈ 52.638 * 1.25 x 10⁻⁷\n    Prob ≈ 65.798 x 10⁻⁷\n    Prob ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
