    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Charge at Huj, which took place on November 8, 1917. This event was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War.\n\nElizabeth Thompson, later known as Lady Butler, was a renowned British painter specializing in military scenes. While she painted battles from various conflicts, including the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, her latest works depicted events from World War I.\n\nA chronological list of some of the latest battles she painted includes:\n*   **The Retreat from Mons**: August 1914\n*   **Charge of the London Scottish at Messines**: October 31, 1914\n*   **Footballers at Loos**: September 1915\n*   **The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia**: February 26, 1916\n*   **The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj**: November 8, 1917\n\nHer final oil painting on a military subject, completed in 1929, was titled *A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders*. While this painting depicts a scene from the First World War (1914-1918), the specific historical event and its date are not precisely identified. Therefore, based on available information, the Charge at Huj is the latest confirmed historical battle depicted in her work.\n\n<<<The Charge at Huj>>>"
