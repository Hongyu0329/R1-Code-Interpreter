    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England. At the time of her death, her husband was overseas on a military campaign in Picardy, France.\n\nDuring 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer, then an esquire in the court of King Edward III, was also abroad on the continent undertaking diplomatic missions for the king. Historical records suggest he may have traveled to France or Italy that year. One specific event mentioned is the possibility of his attendance at the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti in Milan, Italy. Another source indicates he traveled to the continent, \"probably France,\" on the king's service. In 1369, the year after Blanche's death, Chaucer was on military service in France.\n\nWhile it is clear Chaucer was on the European continent, his precise location at the exact time of Blanche of Lancaster's death in September 1368 is not definitively known from historical records. The available information points to either France or Italy, but without certainty.\n\n<<<D>>>"
