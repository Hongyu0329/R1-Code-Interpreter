    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of **Snaut** who discusses missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nDuring a conversation with the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, Snaut reveals that the sound of rustling leaves is an invention of the deceased Dr. Gibarian. Snaut tells Kris, \"...the rustling of leaves. It was Gibarian's invention. So simple, like all genius. I adopted it right away.\" He further implies a shared, almost shameful, longing for this sound among the crew by adding, \"Sartorius made fun of us, but he has one in his room. He hides it in the closet.\" This indicates that even the stern and scientifically-minded Sartorius secretly misses the simple, natural sounds of Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
