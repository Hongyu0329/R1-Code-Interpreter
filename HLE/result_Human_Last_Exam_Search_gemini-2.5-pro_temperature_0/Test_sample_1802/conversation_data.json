    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel Definition:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space is defined by the map:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger$\n    where $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, $\\{U_{ab} = X_a Z_b\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, and $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution satisfying $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$. The operators $X_a$ and $Z_b$ are the generalized shift and clock operators, respectively.\n\n2.  **Kraus Operators and Complementary Channel:** The Kraus operators for this channel are $K_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$. The complementary channel, denoted $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information that leaks to the environment during the channel's operation.\n\n3.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel:** The rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is determined by the dimension of the linear span of the \"Gram operators\" $\\{K_{i}^\\dagger K_{j}\\}$, where $i$ and $j$ are indices running over all pairs $(a,b)$ for which $p_{ab} > 0$. In our case, this is:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{K_{a'b'}^\\dagger K_{ab}\\})$\n    Substituting the expressions for the Kraus operators, we get:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{\\sqrt{p_{a'b'} p_{ab}} U_{a'b'}^\\dagger U_{ab}\\})$\n    Since the probabilities $p_{ab}$ are just non-negative scalars, this is equivalent to:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{U_{a'b'}^\\dagger U_{ab}\\})$\n    where the span is taken over all indices for which the corresponding probabilities are non-zero.\n\n4.  **Properties of Pauli Operators:** The set of $d^2$ Pauli operators $\\{U_{ab}\\}$ forms an orthogonal basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices. A key property is that the product of two Pauli operators is, up to a phase factor, another Pauli operator.\n\n5.  **Maximizing the Rank:** To find the maximal rank, we need to choose the probability distribution $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ such that the dimension of the span of the operator products $\\{U_{a'b'}^\\dagger U_{ab}\\}$ is maximized. The space of all $d \\times d$ matrices has a dimension of $d^2$, so the rank cannot exceed this value.\n\n6.  **Achieving the Maximum:** We can achieve this maximum rank by ensuring that the set of operator products spans the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices. This can be done by choosing a channel where all $d^2$ probabilities $p_{ab}$ are non-zero. For example, the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_{ab} = 1/d^2$ for all $a,b \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$.\n\n    If all $p_{ab} > 0$, we can choose the operator $U_{a'b'}$ to be the identity operator $U_{00} = I$. Then the set of products includes $\\{U_{00}^\\dagger U_{ab} = U_{ab}\\}$ for all $a,b$. Since the set of all Pauli operators $\\{U_{ab}\\}$ forms a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, their span has a dimension of $d^2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d**2>>>"
