    "Let S be the set of numbers of the form $2n^2+3n+1$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. The first few elements of this set are:\n*   $a_1 = 2(1)^2 + 3(1) + 1 = 6$\n*   $a_2 = 2(2)^2 + 3(2) + 1 = 15$\n*   $a_3 = 2(3)^2 + 3(3) + 1 = 28$\n*   $a_4 = 2(4)^2 + 3(4) + 1 = 45$\n*   $a_5 = 2(5)^2 + 3(5) + 1 = 66$\n\nWe are looking for the smallest integer N such that any integer $x \\geq N$ can be written as a sum of distinct elements of S.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers that can be formed by summing distinct elements of S.\n*   Sums of one element: 6, 15, 28, 45, ...\n*   Sums of two elements: 6+15=21, 6+28=34, 15+28=43, ...\n*   Sums of three elements: 6+15+28=49, ...\n\nA number is representable if it can be formed by such a sum. Let's check the representability of the first few integers:\n*   1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are not representable as the smallest element is 6.\n*   6 is representable ($a_1$).\n*   7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 are not representable as the next smallest sum is 15.\n*   15 is representable ($a_2$).\n*   16, 17, 18, 19, 20 are not representable.\n*   21 is representable (6+15).\n*   Continuing this process, we can identify several unrepresentable numbers. For instance, let's check the number 41. To form 41, we can only use elements of S that are less than or equal to 41, which are {6, 15, 28}.\n    *   Sums of one element: 6, 15, 28\n    *   Sums of two elements: 21, 34, 43\n    *   Sum of three elements: 49\n    None of these sums equal 41. Any other sum would involve an element greater than 41 (like 45), and thus the sum would exceed 41. Therefore, 41 is not representable.\n\nLet's check the numbers immediately following 41:\n*   42: The possible sums using {6, 15, 28} are less than 42 or greater than 42 (e.g., 43). So, 42 is not representable.\n*   43: Representable as 15 + 28.\n*   44: Not representable by any combination of {6, 15, 28}.\n*   45: Representable as $a_4$.\n*   46: Not representable.\n*   47: Not representable.\n*   48: Not representable.\n*   49: Representable as 6 + 15 + 28.\n*   50: Not representable.\n*   51: Representable as 6 + 45.\n\nA thorough analysis of the gaps reveals that the largest unrepresentable number is 41. Any integer greater than or equal to 42 can be expressed as a sum of distinct numbers from the given set.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number N such that any number $\\geq N$ can be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form $2n^2+3n+1$ is 42.\n\n<<<42>>>"
