    "Augustine of Hippo was the first Christian theologian to develop specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws at the Fall.\n\nAugustine's key contribution was the concept of ***rationes seminales***, which can be translated as \"seminal reasons\" or \"seedlike principles\". This philosophical and theological framework, which he integrated into Christian thought from Stoic and Neoplatonic ideas, proposed that God embedded latent potentialities into the fabric of creation from the very beginning. According to Augustine, what might appear to us as a change or violation of natural law is, in fact, the unfolding of these pre-ordained potentials at a time of God's choosing.\n\nThis led to his famous dictum that a miracle (or portent) is not contrary to nature, but contrary to our *knowledge* of nature (*\"Portentum ergo fit non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura\"*).\n\nHe applied this framework to both:\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** Augustine affirmed that Mary \"conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever.\" He viewed this miracle not as a disruption of the natural order, but as a unique event made possible by God's power, for which the potential was established within creation. For Augustine, the uniqueness of the virgin birth was crucial because it meant Christ was not conceived through lust, which he saw as a consequence of the Fall, and was thus born without original sin.\n*   **The Fall:** Augustine used the concept of *rationes seminales* to explain the negative changes that occurred in the world after the Fall of Man. He suggested that God had foreseen the possibility of humanity's sin and had woven the potentials for the subsequent curse—such as the growth of thorns and thistles, painful childbirth, and disease—into the original creation. These negative changes were not a chaotic breakdown of nature, but the activation of these latent \"reasons\" as a result of human disobedience.\n\nIn this way, Augustine created a sophisticated system to explain how both redemptive miracles and punitive changes in nature could occur within a universe consistently ordered by God's single, eternal will.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
