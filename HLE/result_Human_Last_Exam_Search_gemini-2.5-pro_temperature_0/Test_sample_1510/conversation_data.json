    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry operations, which are described by their corresponding point groups. The order of a point group refers to the total number of symmetry operations it contains. Due to the crystallographic restriction theorem, the point groups associated with wallpaper groups can only have orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12.\n\nA point group of order 2 contains two symmetry operations: the identity operation and one other operation, which can either be a 180-degree rotation (a C₂ operation) or a reflection (a σ or m operation).\n\nThe four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group's point group is C₂, which consists of the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n*   **pm**: The point group for pm is D₁ (also denoted Cₛ), which contains the identity and a reflection.\n*   **pg**: The point group for pg is also D₁ (or Cₛ), containing the identity and a reflection.\n*   **cm**: This group also has the point group D₁ (or Cₛ), which is of order 2.\n\nOther wallpaper groups are associated with point groups of different orders. For instance, groups like pmm, pmg, pgg, and cmm have a point group of D₂, which is of order 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
