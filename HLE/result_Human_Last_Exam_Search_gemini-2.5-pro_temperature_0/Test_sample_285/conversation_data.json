    "To determine the largest $p$ such that the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need to find the critical exponent $p_c$ for the $L^p$-integrability of $I(\\mathbf{a})$. The function $I(\\mathbf{a})$ will be in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for $p > p_c$ and not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for $p \\le p_c$. The question asks for the largest such $p$, which is $p_c$.\n\nThe function is given by the oscillatory integral:\n$I(\\mathbf{a}) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i \\Phi(\\mathbf{a}, x, y)} dxdy$\nwhere $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ and the phase function is a cubic polynomial in $x$ and $y$:\n$\\Phi(\\mathbf{a}, x, y) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$.\n\nThe integrability of $|I(\\mathbf{a})|^p$ in $\\mathbb{R}^9$ depends on the decay rate of $I(\\mathbf{a})$ as $|\\mathbf{a}| \\to \\infty$. Let's write $\\mathbf{a} = \\lambda \\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ for a large scalar $\\lambda > 0$ and a fixed unit vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\in S^8$. The integral becomes:\n$I(\\lambda\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i \\lambda \\Phi(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}, x, y)} dxdy$\n\nThe decay rate of this integral as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ is of the form $\\lambda^{-\\delta(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})}$. The convergence of the $L^p$ integral is determined by the slowest possible decay rate, $\\delta_{\\min} = \\inf_{\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\in S^8} \\delta(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})$.\n\nThe integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p d\\mathbf{a}$ can be evaluated in spherical coordinates:\n$\\int_{S^8} \\int_0^\\infty |I(r\\boldsymbol{\\omega})|^p r^8 dr d\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$\nFor a fixed direction $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ where the decay is $|I(r\\boldsymbol{\\omega})| \\sim r^{-\\delta_{\\min}}$, the inner integral becomes $\\int_0^\\infty (r^{-\\delta_{\\min}})^p r^8 dr = \\int_0^\\infty r^{8-p\\delta_{\\min}} dr$.\nThis integral diverges at infinity if the exponent is greater than or equal to -1, i.e., $8-p\\delta_{\\min} \\ge -1$, which simplifies to $p\\delta_{\\min} \\le 9$.\nThis means that if there is any direction with decay $\\delta_{\\min}$, the whole integral will diverge for $p \\le 9/\\delta_{\\min}$. Thus, the critical exponent is $p_c = 9/\\delta_{\\min}$.\n\nOur task is to find the minimal decay exponent $\\delta_{\\min}$. This corresponds to choosing the coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$ (and thus the direction $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$) such that the phase function $\\Phi$ is as \"flat\" as possible at some point $(x_0, y_0) \\in^2$. The flatness is determined by the vanishing of derivatives of $\\Phi$ at $(x_0, y_0)$.\n\nThe decay rate of such two-dimensional oscillatory integrals is known from the theory of Newton polyhedra. The decay exponent $\\delta$ is related to the order of degeneracy of the phase.\n1.  If the phase has a non-degenerate critical point (where $\\nabla \\Phi = 0$ and the Hessian matrix is non-singular), the decay is $\\lambda^{-1}$.\n2.  If the phase has a more degenerate critical point, the decay is slower.\n\nWe want to find the worst-case degeneracy. The phase $\\Phi$ is a polynomial of degree 3. By choosing the coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$ appropriately, we can create a highly degenerate critical point. Let's choose the point to be $(0,0)$ without loss of generality.\n- To make $(0,0)$ a critical point, we need $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x}(0,0) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y}(0,0) = 0$. This means $a_1 = 0$ and $a_2 = 0$.\n- To make it more degenerate, we can make the quadratic part vanish at $(0,0)$. The quadratic part is $a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2$. We set $a_3=a_4=a_5=0$.\n- Now the phase is a homogeneous cubic polynomial: $\\Phi(x,y) = a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$. The decay of the integral is now determined by this cubic part.\n- The decay can be even slower if this cubic form is itself degenerate. The slowest decay occurs when the phase is, after a change of coordinates, a power of a single variable. A cubic polynomial in two variables is maximally degenerate if it is the cube of a linear form, i.e., $(c_1 x + c_2 y)^3$. By a linear change of variables in $(x,y)$, this can be written as $u^3$.\n\nLet's choose the coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$ to achieve this. For example, let's set $a_6=1$ and all other coefficients $a_i=0$. The integral becomes:\n$I(0, \\dots, 0, a_6, 0, \\dots, 0) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i a_6 x^3} dxdy$\nSince the integrand does not depend on $y$, the integral over $y$ is 1:\n$I(a_6) = \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_6 x^3} dx$\nThis is a one-dimensional oscillatory integral. The phase $\\phi(x) = x^3$ has a degenerate critical point at $x=0$ of order 2 (since $\\phi'(0)=\\phi''(0)=0$, but $\\phi'''(0) \\ne 0$). The decay rate of this integral is well-known to be $|a_6|^{-1/3}$.\n\nThis is the slowest possible decay for an integral whose phase is a cubic polynomial. A phase like $x^2y$ gives a decay of $|a_7|^{-1/2}$, which is faster. A non-degenerate cubic form like $x^3+y^3$ gives a decay of $|a|^{-2/3}$, also faster. Therefore, the minimal decay exponent is $\\delta_{\\min} = 1/3$.\n\nNow we can calculate the critical exponent $p_c$:\n$p_c = \\frac{9}{\\delta_{\\min}} = \\frac{9}{1/3} = 27$.\n\nThe largest value of $p$ for which the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ is $p_c=27$. For $p \\le 27$, the integral $\\int |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p d\\mathbf{a}$ diverges, while for $p > 27$, it converges.\n\nFinal check: We must ensure that $I(\\mathbf{a})$ is not in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, otherwise $p_c$ would have to be less than or equal to 2. The $L^2$-norm squared is given by $\\int |I(\\mathbf{a})|^2 d\\mathbf{a} = \\int_{^4} \\delta(\\mathbf{u}(x,y) - \\mathbf{u}(x',y')) dxdydx'dy'$, where $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = (x, y, x^2, \\dots, y^3)$. Since the map $\\mathbf{u}$ is injective on $^2$, the integral is over the diagonal set where $(x,y)=(x',y')$. This leads to a divergent integral, confirming that $I \\notin L^2(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ and our result $p_c=27$ is plausible.\n\n<<<27>>>"
