    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the Russian nobleman and explorer, **Rezanov**.\n\nNikolai Petrovich Rezanov's life and tragic romance with Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco, became the subject of Voznesensky's poem \"Saga.\" This poem formed the libretto for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which premiered in 1981. The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" reflects the historical uncertainty surrounding Rezanov's final resting place.\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on March 1, 1807, while returning to St. Petersburg. He was initially buried in the cemetery of the Resurrection Cathedral in Krasnoyarsk, and a monument was erected on his grave in 1831. However, in the 1930s, the cathedral and the cemetery were destroyed by the Bolsheviks, and Rezanov's grave was lost.\n\nThe answer to the question of his grave's location began to emerge in the late 20th century, a period that coincides with the immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" in the Soviet Union. According to some accounts, his remains were moved to the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk in the late 1950s. Efforts by local historians in the post-Soviet era, specifically in the 1990s, led to the rediscovery of the burial site. This culminated in the erection of a new memorial cross on his presumed grave at the Trinity Cemetery on October 28, 2000. One side of the cross bears the inscription \"Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov 1764–1807. I will never forget you,\" and the other, \"Maria Concepcion de Arguello 1791–1857. I will never see you,\" quoting the famous lines from the rock opera.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
