    "**\"An American in Paris,\" the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor to feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk.**\n\nThe iconic Parisian landmark appears during the film's celebrated 17-minute ballet sequence. This extended, dialogue-free dance number, choreographed by and starring Gene Kelly, transports the characters to various stylized settings throughout the French capital.\n\nOne of these dream-like locations is the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk stands as a central feature. In a scene described as a \"tribute to George Gershwin's iconic composition,\" Gene Kelly is shown on a set that suggests the famous square. Another description of the ballet notes that the fountain at the Place de la Concorde serves as a \"dream dance floor\" for Kelly and co-star Leslie Caron. The entire ballet was filmed on 44 different sets on the MGM backlot, with the Place de la Concorde sequence designed in the style of French painter Raoul Dufy.\n\nPrior to \"An American in Paris,\" no other Best Picture winner had a narrative or setting that would include the Luxor Obelisk, which is located in Paris, or its twin, which remains in Luxor, Egypt. While other winners were set in various international locations, none featured scenes in the specific Parisian square or the Egyptian temple. For instance, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956) includes Paris in its global itinerary, but the plot details do not indicate any scenes at the Place de la Concorde.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
