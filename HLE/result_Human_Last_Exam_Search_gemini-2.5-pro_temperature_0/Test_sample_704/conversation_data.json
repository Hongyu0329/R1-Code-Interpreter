    "## The Musical Note G Corresponds to the Range Between Green and Blue on Newton's Colour Circle\n\n**The musical note that corresponds to the range between the colour produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself on Sir Isaac Newton's colour circle is G.** This determination is based on Newton's own arrangement of colours and musical notes on his circular diagram.\n\nIn his work *Opticks*, published in 1704, Newton proposed a relationship between the colours of the visible spectrum and the notes of a musical scale. He arranged the seven colours of the spectrum—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—in a circle, associating them with the notes of a Dorian musical mode starting on the note D.\n\nThe colour produced by mixing yellow and blue paint is green. Following the sequence on Newton's colour circle, the colour that lies between green and blue is associated with the musical note G. Newton's system assigned specific notes to each colour, and in his arrangement, the segment for green precedes the segment for blue, with the note G falling within this transitional area.\n\nNewton's colour wheel was a significant development in understanding the relationships between colours and was also influential in the development of colour theory. His analogy between colour and music, though not scientifically validated in the modern sense, was a compelling concept that sought to find underlying mathematical harmonies in nature. The circle was designed to show how primary colours could be mixed to create secondary colours and how the entire system could be analogous to a musical octave.\n\n<<<G>>>"
