    "The pattern is a Vigen√®re cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. The keyword for this puzzle is \"aperture\".\n\nThe words decode as follows:\n*   `utpshtheas` decodes to `fire alarm`\n*   `fkuhu` decodes to `earth`\n*   `numhkatnatu` decodes to `water`\n*   `anhaeketn` decodes to `air`\n\nThe decoded words represent the four classical elements. The last word in the sequence, `anhaeketn`, is decoded using the corresponding part of the repeating key \"aperturea\".\n\n<<<air>>>"
