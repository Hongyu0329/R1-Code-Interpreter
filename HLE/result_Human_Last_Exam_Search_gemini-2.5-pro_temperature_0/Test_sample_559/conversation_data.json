    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. These are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points, or trajectories that connect equilibrium points (homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits).\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$ gives $2d^2 = 0$, which means $d=0$. So, **(0, 0)** is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$ gives $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This yields $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)** are equilibrium points.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nWe analyze the stability by examining the Jacobian matrix at each equilibrium point.\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):** The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since both are positive, (0, 1) is an **unstable node (source)**.\n*   **At (-1, 1):** The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**.\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian matrix is the zero matrix, so the stability is undetermined by linearization.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nSeparatrices are associated with saddle points. The stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1) are separatrices. We test for a simple invariant curve, which could represent one of these manifolds. An invariant curve is a curve such that any trajectory starting on it stays on it.\n\nLet's test if a curve of the form $d = f(u)$ is an invariant manifold. By trying a simple polynomial, we test $d = -u^2$. To verify if this is an invariant curve, we must check if it satisfies the system's dynamics, meaning $\\frac{d(d)}{dt} = \\frac{d(-u^2)}{dt}$.\n\nThe time derivative of $d = -u^2$ is $d' = -2u \\cdot u'$.\nSubstituting the expression for $u'$:\n$d' = -2u \\cdot (u-1)u^2 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the first differential equation:\n$d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d' = 2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n$d' = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d' = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince both expressions for $d'$ are identical, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\nThis curve passes through the equilibrium points (0, 0) (since $0 = -0^2$) and the saddle point (-1, 1) (since $-1 = -1^2$). A trajectory that connects two equilibrium points is known as a heteroclinic orbit, which is a type of separatrix. This particular curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1).\n\nTherefore, the separatrix of the system is the parabolic curve given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
