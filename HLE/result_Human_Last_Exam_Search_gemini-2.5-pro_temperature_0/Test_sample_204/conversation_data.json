    "The Hopf charge of the given vector field can be determined by analyzing its topological structure. The vector field is defined in a way that describes a toroidal hopfion. For such a configuration, the Hopf charge, an integer topological invariant, is the product of two winding numbers: the azimuthal (or planar) winding number, `n`, and the poloidal winding number, `m`.\n\nThe vector field is given by:\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n*   `G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n*   `nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis can be interpreted as a unit vector in spherical coordinates where `f` is the azimuthal angle and `G` is the polar angle.\n\n1.  **Azimuthal Winding Number (n):** The azimuthal angle is `f = atan2(y,x)`. As one traverses a loop in the xy-plane around the origin, the angle `f` changes by `2π`. The terms `cos(f)` and `sin(f)` in `nx` and `ny` mean that the vector field winds once around the z-axis. Therefore, the azimuthal winding number is `n = 1`.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding Number (m):** The term `r2` represents a toroidal radial coordinate, with the core of the torus defined by `r2 = 0`, which corresponds to a circle of radius `sqrt(0.5)` in the `z=0` plane. The polar angle `G` depends on `r2`. As one moves along a path that constitutes a poloidal loop (circling the core of the torus), `r2` goes from a large value to zero and back to a large value. Consequently, `G` varies from `0` (since `exp(-large number)` is close to 0) to `PI` (since `exp(0) = 1`) and back to `0`. This full range of the polar angle from 0 to `π` and back describes a single winding in the poloidal direction. Thus, the poloidal winding number is `m = 1`.\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` is the product of these two winding numbers.\n\n`H = n * m = 1 * 1 = 1`\n\nThe given vector field describes a fundamental hopfion with the lowest possible non-zero topological charge.\n\n<<<1>>>"
