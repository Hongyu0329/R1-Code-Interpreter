There is no direct French equivalent for the name "Odobeccus" as it is a Germanic name, not a Gaulish one that would have evolved into a French name. However, the component "-beccus" comes from the Gaulish word for "beak," which is "bec" in modern French. The first part, "Odo-," is Germanic and means "wealth" or "property." Therefore, a literal but non-standard translation of the name's meaning into French could be "Riche-bec."
