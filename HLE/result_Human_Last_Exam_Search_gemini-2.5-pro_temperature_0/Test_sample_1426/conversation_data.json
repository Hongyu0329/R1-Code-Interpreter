    "The first violin part in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\" concludes the fourth movement with a series of notes that culminate in a final B-flat major chord played by the full orchestra. The first violins end on a sustained B-flat.\n\nSpecifically, the last three notes played by the first violin section are all B-flat.
