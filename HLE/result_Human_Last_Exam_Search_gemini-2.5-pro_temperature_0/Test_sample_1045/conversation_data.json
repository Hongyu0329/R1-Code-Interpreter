    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we must first understand how the 6-31G basis set is defined for each atom in the molecule.\n\n### Breakdown of the 6-31G Basis Set:\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented. It is a split-valence basis set, meaning core and valence electrons are treated differently.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen (H):** Hydrogen only has a valence 1s orbital. The \"31\" part of the notation indicates that this valence orbital is \"split\" into two basis functions. One is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussian functions, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian function.\n    *   **Total functions for H = 2**\n\n*   **For Carbon (C):** Carbon is a \"heavy atom\" (any atom other than H or He) and has both core and valence orbitals.\n    *   **Core orbital (1s):** The '6' in 6-31G signifies that the core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted function made from 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Valence orbitals (2s, 2p):** The \"31\" indicates the valence shell is split into two parts.\n        *   An \"inner\" part for the 2s and 2p orbitals, represented by one s-function and one set of p-functions (px, py, pz). These are contracted from 3 primitive Gaussians each. This gives 1 (for s) + 3 (for p) = 4 functions.\n        *   An \"outer\" part, also for the 2s and 2p orbitals, represented by another s-function and another set of p-functions. These are each composed of a single primitive Gaussian. This gives another 1 (for s) + 3 (for p) = 4 functions.\n    *   **Total functions for C = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9**\n\n### Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene molecule.\n\n*   **Carbon atoms:** Toluene has 7 carbon atoms.\n    *   7 C atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** Toluene has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   8 H atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\n**Total Contracted Functions = 63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = 79**\n\n<<<79>>>"
