    "When Glia Maturation Factor-γ (GMFG) is broken down or its function is inhibited, it allows for increased macrophage engulfment of amyloid-beta (Aβ).\n\nGMFG is an actin-disassembly protein found in high levels in immune cells. Research has shown that reducing the amount of functional GMFG in macrophages, a process known as knockdown, leads to a significant increase in their ability to phagocytose, or engulf, Aβ42. Conversely, overexpressing GMFG in these cells reduces their capacity to take up Aβ42.\n\nThe mechanism behind this involves the scavenger receptor class A type I (SR-AI), a cell-surface receptor that plays a role in clearing Aβ. The breakdown of GMFG increases the expression and stability of SR-AI on macrophages. This, in turn, enhances the macrophages' ability to bind to and engulf amyloid-beta peptides. Studies have demonstrated that GMFG knockdown inhibits the degradation of SR-AI through both lysosomal and proteasomal pathways, leading to higher levels of the receptor on the cell surface.\n\nAnother protein, SHARPIN, has also been identified as a regulator of Aβ phagocytosis. However, unlike GMFG, SHARPIN appears to promote this process, meaning its breakdown would likely hinder amyloid engulfment.\n\n<<<Glia Maturation Factor-γ (GMFG)>>>"
