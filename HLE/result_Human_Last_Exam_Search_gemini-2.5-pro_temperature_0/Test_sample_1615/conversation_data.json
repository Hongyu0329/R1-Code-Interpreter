    "The maximum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, which is not a complete graph, is $12344$.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  The number of colors needed to properly color a graph is called its **chromatic number**, denoted by $\\chi(G)$.\n2.  For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$. So, for the given graph $G$, $\\chi(G) \\leq 12345$.\n3.  A graph with $n$ vertices has a chromatic number of $n$ if and only if it is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n4.  The problem states that the graph $G$ is **not** the complete graph $K_{12345}$. This means that there is at least one pair of vertices in $G$ that are not connected by an edge.\n5.  If a graph is not complete, its chromatic number must be less than the number of vertices. Therefore, for the given graph $G$, $\\chi(G) < 12345$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\leq 12344$.\n6.  To show that $12344$ is the maximum possible chromatic number, we must demonstrate that a graph with $12345$ vertices that is not complete can require $12344$ colors.\n7.  Consider the following construction:\n    *   Take a complete graph with $12344$ vertices, known as $K_{12344}$. To color this subgraph, $12344$ distinct colors are required.\n    *   Add a single, 12345th vertex to the graph and do not connect it to any of the other vertices (this is an isolated vertex).\n8.  This newly constructed graph has the following properties:\n    *   It has $12345$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n    *   The chromatic number is $12344$. This is because the $K_{12344}$ subgraph requires $12344$ colors, and the isolated vertex can be colored with any of these $12344$ colors without conflict.\n\nSince we have shown that the chromatic number cannot exceed $12344$ and that a value of $12344$ is achievable for a graph that is not complete, the maximum number of colors needed is $12344$.\n\nThis conclusion is also supported by Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$, the chromatic number is at most its maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In our constructed example, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G) = 12343$ (the degree of any vertex in the $K_{12344}$ part), and the chromatic number is $\\chi(G) = 12344$. This case is not covered directly by the main statement of Brooks' theorem because the graph is not connected, but the principle can be applied to its components. The chromatic number of the graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components, which is $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
