    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this product is formed:\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide, and it is treated with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, sterically bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism.\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Substrate**: The (1S,2R) designation for a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* to each other. This means they are on opposite faces of the cyclohexane ring.\n3.  **The E2 Mechanism's Stereochemical Requirement**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the hydrogen atom being removed and the leaving group (in this case, bromine) must be in an *anti-periplanar* position. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both the hydrogen and the leaving group must be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one pointing up, the other down). This is known as a trans-diaxial arrangement.\n4.  **Chair Conformations and Reactivity**:\n    *   A *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane like (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one where both the bromo and methyl groups are in equatorial positions (diequatorial), and another where they are both in axial positions (diaxial).\n    *   The diequatorial conformation is significantly more stable and is the predominant form at equilibrium. However, in this conformation, the equatorial bromine is not anti-periplanar to any adjacent hydrogens, so it cannot undergo an E2 reaction.\n    *   For the reaction to occur, the ring must flip to the much less stable diaxial conformation, where the bromine is axial.\n5.  **Determining the Product**:\n    *   In the reactive diaxial conformation, the bromine is axial, and the methyl group on the adjacent carbon (C2) is also axial.\n    *   The E2 reaction requires an axial hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the one with the bromine (the Î²-carbon).\n    *   **At C2**: The methyl group is axial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is in an equatorial position. Since there is no axial hydrogen on C2, elimination cannot occur towards this carbon to form 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n    *   Therefore, the tert-butoxide base can only remove the axial hydrogen from C6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is considered the Hofmann product (the less substituted alkene), but its formation is dictated by the strict stereochemical requirements of the E2 reaction, which override Zaitsev's rule in this case.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
