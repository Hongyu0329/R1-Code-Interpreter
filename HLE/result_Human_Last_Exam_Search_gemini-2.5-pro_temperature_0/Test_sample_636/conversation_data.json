    "To solve this problem, we need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nGiven matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix `F` must have dimensions `m x n`, where `n` is the number of states (2) and `m` is the number of inputs (2). So, `F` is a 2x2 matrix.\nLet `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n\n**1. Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial for these eigenvalues is:\n`p(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j² = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n\n**2. Closed-Loop System Matrix**\n\nNext, we compute the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**3. Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is given by `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`.\nFor a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]`, the characteristic polynomial is `λ² - (a+d)λ + (ad-bc)`.\nHere, `a+d` is the trace (`tr`) and `ad-bc` is the determinant (`det`).\n\n`tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2`\n`det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of `p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2` with the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`, we get:\n`-tr(A_cl) = 2`  => `tr(A_cl) = -2`\n`det(A_cl) = 2`\n\nThis gives us a system of two equations:\n1.  `-1 + f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -2`  => `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1`\n2.  `f2(-1 + f1 + 2*f3) - (1 + f1)(1 + f2 + 2*f4) = 2`\n\n**4. Solving for F**\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This means the solution for `F` is not unique. We can find a particular solution by setting some of the elements of `F` to zero.\n\nLet's assume we only use the first control input, which means the second row of `F` is zero. Let `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n\nThe system of equations simplifies to:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `f2(-1 + f1) - (1 + f1)(1 + f2) = 2`\n\nNow we solve this system of two equations with two unknowns:\nFrom equation (1), we have `f1 = -1 - f2`.\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n`f2(-1 + (-1 - f2)) - (1 + (-1 - f2))(1 + f2) = 2`\n`f2(-2 - f2) - (-f2)(1 + f2) = 2`\n`-2*f2 - f2² - (-f2 - f2²) = 2`\n`-2*f2 - f2² + f2 + f2² = 2`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nNow, substitute `f2 = -2` back into the expression for `f1`:\n`f1 = -1 - (-2) = 1`\n\nSo, a valid state feedback gain matrix is `F` with `f1=1`, `f2=-2`, `f3=0`, and `f4=0`.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nWe can verify this result:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]] = [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation for this matrix is:\n`det(λI - (A+BF)) = det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThe roots of this equation are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = -1 ± j`, which are the desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<[[1, -2],]>>>"
