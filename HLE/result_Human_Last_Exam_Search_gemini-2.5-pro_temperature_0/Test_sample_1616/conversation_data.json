    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word, often as a result of adding a suffix.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n*   **derivative**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /aɪ/ in the root word *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative* (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/).\n*   **serenity**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* changes to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity* (/səˈrɛnɪti/).\n*   **gratitude**: This word also underwent trisyllabic laxing. The related word *grateful* has a tense vowel /eɪ/, which becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in the trisyllabic word *gratitude* (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/).\n*   **southern**: The vowel change in *south* (/saʊθ/) to *southern* (/ˈsʌðərn/) is a case of laxing. Historically, *southern* was a three-syllable word in Middle English (*southerne*), and the rule applied then.\n*   **pleasant**: The change from *please* (/pliːz/) to *pleasant* (/ˈplɛzənt/) involves a vowel becoming lax, but it occurs in a two-syllable word. This is considered a different process, sometimes called disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: This word did not undergo trisyllabic laxing. It is a two-syllable word that comes from the Old English word *sceaduwe*. The vowel laxing seen in the related pair *shade* versus *shadow* is a separate process known as disyllabic laxing.\n\nWhile multiple words in the list are only two syllables, *shadow* is the clearest example of a word whose phonological history does not involve trisyllabic laxing at all. It is a native English word derived from Old English, and its vowel development follows a different path.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
