The approximate number of logical non-Clifford (Toffoli) gates required is 6.5 billion for both scenarios. However, a distance-3 code is insufficient for fault-tolerance, and a distance-5 code with a 1% physical error rate would not provide a low enough logical error rate for a successful implementation of an algorithm of this scale.
