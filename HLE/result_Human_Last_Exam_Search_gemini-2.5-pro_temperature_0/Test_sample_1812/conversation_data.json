The Markov quiver is related to the Markov equation x² + y² + z² - 3xyz = 0. The provided matrix is associated with the study of Markov numbers and cluster algebras. Specifically, this matrix is sometimes referred to as the Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra of type A_2^(1), and its determinant is known to be 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
