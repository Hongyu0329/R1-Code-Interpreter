    "The number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is 206. This result is part of the complete classification of imaginary quadratic fields for class numbers up to 100, a solution to the Gauss class number problem for this range.\n\nThe definitive work confirming this number was published by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". This paper provides tables listing the number of fundamental discriminants for each class number up to 100. For a class number of 48, the number of such discriminants is 206.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in general, asks for a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number. While the problem for small class numbers was tackled over many years, Watkins' work provided a comprehensive solution for all class numbers up to 100.\n\n<<<206>>>"
