    "After extensive research into the history of the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome, there is no evidence to suggest that a unique architectural feature was removed from the square by the city administration in 1950.\n\nHistorical records and numerous sources detail various transformations of the piazza over the centuries. These include the clearing of medieval market stalls and sheds by order of Pope Eugenius IV in the 15th century, the construction of the fountain by Giacomo della Porta in 1575, and the addition of the Egyptian obelisk in 1711. In the 19th century, some buildings adjoining the square were demolished to enlarge the space.\n\nFurthermore, significant alterations were made to the Pantheon itself, which stands on the piazza. These include the removal of its bronze roof tiles and, most notably, the demolition of the twin bell towers, often referred to as the \"ass's ears,\" in the late 19th century.\n\nWhile there were urban development projects in Rome during the mid-20th century, including demolitions in other areas, no documentation found refers to the removal of a specific architectural feature from the Piazza della Rotonda in or around 1950.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the premise of the question cannot be confirmed.\n\n<<<There is no evidence of a unique architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.>>>"
