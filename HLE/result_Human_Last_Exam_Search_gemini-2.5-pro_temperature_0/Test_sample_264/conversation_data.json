    "The search results confirm that this is a standard problem with a straightforward solution if the cubes' faces remain parallel. The key is to determine the intersection of the coordinate intervals for each axis.\n\nLet's formalize the setup:\n\n1.  **First Cube (C1):** We can define the first cube with side length 1 as occupying the region where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Main Diagonal:** The main diagonal of this cube connects the origin `(0, 0, 0)` to the opposite vertex `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is `(1, 1, 1)`.\n\n3.  **Shift:** The second cube (C2) is shifted by `1/2` along this main diagonal. This means the shift vector is `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\n4.  **Second Cube (C2):** C2 is obtained by shifting every point of C1 by the vector `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. Therefore, C2 occupies the region defined by:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n5.  **Intersection Volume:** The intersection of the two cubes is the region where a point `(x, y, z)` satisfies the conditions for both C1 and C2. We find the intersection of the intervals for each coordinate:\n    *   For x: `max(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   For y: `max(0, 1/2) ≤ y ≤ min(1, 3/2)`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   For z: `max(0, 1/2) ≤ z ≤ min(1, 3/2)`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\nThe resulting intersection is a smaller cube. The length of each side of this intersection cube is:\n*   Side length in x = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in y = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in z = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths.\n\nVolume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\nThe shape of the intersection is a cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume of their intersection is the cube of its side length.\n\nVolume = (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\nFinal check of the logic. The interpretation of the shift vector is key. \"Shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is interpreted as a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This keeps the faces of the cubes parallel, making the intersection an axis-aligned box. If the shift was a distance of 1/2, the shift vector's components would be `1/(2*sqrt(3))`, resulting in a more complex calculation. However, the former interpretation is standard for such problems and leads to a clean, geometric result. The search results about intersecting axis-aligned cubes support this simpler approach.\n\nThe volume of the intersection is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
