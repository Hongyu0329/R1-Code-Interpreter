It is not definitively true that the second postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first without additional assumptions. The derivability depends on whether one assumes Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism as fundamental laws within the first postulate. Without this assumption, the first postulate alone is insufficient and allows for other theories of relativity, such as Galilean relativity. Therefore, in the standard formulation of special relativity, the second postulate is considered a necessary and independent principle.
