    "An analysis of the problem reveals that to compare two strings lexicographically, we must access characters from both strings at the same position (index). Since standard input is a sequential stream, we cannot read a character from the first string, then a character from the second, and then go back to the second character of the first string. This limitation necessitates storing at least one of the strings in memory completely.\n\nTo achieve maximum memory efficiency, the optimal strategy is to:\n1.  Read the first string into a buffer.\n2.  Read the second string one character at a time.\n3.  As each character of the second string is read, compare it with the corresponding character from the buffered first string.\n\nThis approach avoids the need for a second buffer to store the second string, thus minimizing memory usage.\n\nThe C program below implements this memory-efficient strategy.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be memory-efficient by only storing one string\n * in a buffer and reading the second string character by character.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Buffer to store the first string.\n    // Max length is 100, plus 1 for the null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first line into the buffer.\n    // fgets is used as it's safer than scanf and handles the newline.\n    fgets(s1, sizeof(s1), stdin);\n\n    // Index for iterating through the first string buffer.\n    int i = 0;\n\n    // Variable to hold characters from the second string.\n    // It's an int to handle the EOF value from getchar().\n    int c2;\n\n    // Read the second string character by character and compare.\n    // The loop terminates on a newline or end-of-file.\n    while ((c2 = getchar()) != EOF && c2 != '\\n') {\n        // Convert characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)c2)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)c2)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables in this program is the sum of the sizes of all declared variables on the stack. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: An array to hold the first string (up to 100 characters plus a null terminator).\n    *   Memory = 101 * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = **101 bytes**.\n*   **`int i`**: An integer variable to serve as an index for the `s1` array.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n*   **`int c2`**: An integer variable to store the character read from the second string by `getchar()`. `getchar` returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 4 + 4 = **109 bytes**.\n\n<<<109>>>"
