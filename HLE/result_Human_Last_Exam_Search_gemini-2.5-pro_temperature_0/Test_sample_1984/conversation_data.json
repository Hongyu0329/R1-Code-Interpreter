    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the given differential equation. The equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\nSet $x'(t) = 0$ to find the equilibrium points:\n$-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0$\n\nFactor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0$\n\nThe equilibrium points are the solutions to this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. Let $f(x) = -x(x - 1)^{2}$. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if for values of $x$ near $x^*$, the sign of $f(x)$ is positive for $x < x^*$ and negative for $x > x^*$. This means that solutions starting near $x^*$ will move towards $x^*$.\n\nWe can use the first derivative test for stability. The derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate the sign of $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n1.  For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n2.  For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around $x = 1$.\n    Let's examine the sign of $f(x) = -x(x - 1)^{2}$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n    *   For $x > 1$ (e.g., $x = 1.1$), $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1 - 1)^{2} = -1.1(0.1)^{2} < 0$. This indicates that for $x > 1$, $x(t)$ decreases towards 1.\n    *   For $x < 1$ but close to 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9 - 1)^{2} = -0.9(-0.1)^{2} < 0$. This indicates that for $x < 1$, $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from 1.\n\nSince solutions on one side of $x=1$ move towards it, but on the other side move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. The number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
