    "The maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum with one point removed is $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$, where $\\mathfrak{c}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification for this answer:\n1.  Let $X$ be a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x \\in X$. The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a connected, non-compact, locally compact, and separable metric space.\n2.  The Stone-Čech remainder, denoted $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$, is the set of points in the Stone-Čech compactification of $Y$ that are not in $Y$ itself.\n3.  A key theorem by David Bellamy states that for a compact metric space $M$ and a closed subset $A$ such that $M \\setminus A$ is connected, the remainder $\\beta(M \\setminus A) \\setminus (M \\setminus A)$ is an indecomposable continuum. In our case, $M=X$ and $A=\\{x\\}$, so the remainder $Y^*$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n4.  For a locally compact, non-compact, and $\\sigma$-compact space like $Y$, the weight of its Stone-Čech remainder $Y^*$ is $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n5.  Thus, the question is reduced to finding the maximum possible number of composants of an indecomposable continuum of weight $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n6.  The number of composants of a non-metric indecomposable continuum can vary. It is known that the number must be either 1 or at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n7.  A significant result by M. Smith and later generalized by J. Prajs demonstrates that for any infinite cardinal number $\\mathfrak{m}$, there exists an indecomposable continuum with $2^\\mathfrak{m}$ composants. For a continuum of weight $\\kappa = \\mathfrak{c}$, this implies there are examples with $2^\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n8.  While the specific continua constructed by Prajs are not explicitly shown to be realizable as a Stone-Čech remainder of the form $Y^*$, the class of continua that can be formed as remainders is known to be very rich. Furthermore, for similar spaces that are locally connected, it has been proven that the number of composants in the remainder is exactly $2^\\mathfrak{c}$.\n9.  The phrasing of the question, asking for the *maximum possible* number, implies that the number of composants can vary depending on the choice of the continuum $X$ and the point $x$. Given that continua with $2^\\mathfrak{c}$ composants exist and there is no known theorem that limits this number for the specific class of remainders in question, the maximum possible number is the theoretical maximum.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of composants is $2^\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<2^c>>>"
