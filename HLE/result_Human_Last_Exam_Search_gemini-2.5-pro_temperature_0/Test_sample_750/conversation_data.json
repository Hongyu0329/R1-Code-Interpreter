    "The problem is to find all complex numbers $z$ that satisfy the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\nTo solve this equation, we must first recognize that the term $i^z$ is a multi-valued function in the complex plane. We can express $i$ in its exponential form, $i = e^{i\\pi/2}$. However, due to the periodicity of the complex exponential function, we can write $i = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. Then the equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = (e^{iC_k})^z = e^{izC_k}$\n\nTo solve for $z$, we can use the Lambert W function, which is defined as the function $W(s)$ that satisfies the equation $W(s)e^{W(s)} = s$. Like the complex logarithm, the Lambert W function is multi-valued, with branches denoted by $W_n(s)$ for any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's rearrange the equation to match the form required for the Lambert W function.\nLet $w = -izC_k$. This implies that $z = \\frac{iw}{C_k}$.\nSubstituting this expression for $z$ back into the equation:\n$(\\frac{iw}{C_k})i = e^{-w}$\n$\\frac{-w}{C_k} = e^{-w}$\n$w e^w = -C_k$\n\nThe solution for $w$ is given by the Lambert W function:\n$w = W_n(-C_k)$\nwhere $n$ is an integer representing the chosen branch of the W function.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $z$, we get the general solution for all possible values of $z$:\n$z_{k,n} = \\frac{i W_n(-C_k)}{C_k} = \\frac{i W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\nThis formula generates all solutions for $z$ by considering all integer values for $k$ (from the logarithm) and $n$ (from the Lambert W function).\n\nThe solutions can be categorized into three types:\n\n1.  **Real Solutions**:\n    There are two real solutions:\n    *   $z=1$: This solution can be obtained from the general formula with $k=0$ and $n=0$.\n        $z_{0,0} = \\frac{i W_0(-\\pi/2)}{\\pi/2} = \\frac{i(-i\\pi/2)}{\\pi/2} = 1$.\n    *   $z=-1$: This solution is obtained when $n=k$ for any integer $k$.\n        $z_{k,k} = \\frac{i W_k(-C_k)}{C_k} = \\frac{i(iC_k)}{C_k} = -1$.\n\n2.  **Purely Imaginary Solutions**:\n    These solutions are of the form $z=iy$ for some real number $y$. This occurs when $k \\le -1$ and $n=0$. For these values of $k$, the argument of the W function, $-C_k$, is a positive real number. The principal branch $W_0(-C_k)$ is real and positive, while all other branches are complex.\n    The purely imaginary solutions are given by:\n    $z_{k,0} = \\frac{i W_0(-C_k)}{C_k}$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\le -1$.\n    For each such $k$, there is a unique solution on the negative imaginary axis. For example, for $k=-1$, $C_{-1} = -3\\pi/2$, and the solution is $z = iy_{-1}$ where $y_{-1}$ is the solution to $-y = e^{3\\pi y/2}$, which is approximately $y_{-1} \\approx -0.27$.\n\n3.  **Complex Solutions**:\n    All other combinations of integers $k$ and $n$ yield complex solutions with non-zero real and imaginary parts. The set of all solutions is the set of all $z_{k,n}$ where the pair $(k,n)$ does not fall into the categories above.\n    For example, for $(k,n) = (0,1)$:\n    $z_{0,1} = \\frac{i W_1(-\\pi/2)}{\\pi/2} \\approx \\frac{i(1.5339 + 4.3752i)}{1.5708} \\approx -2.7854 + 0.9765i$.\n\nIn summary, the complete set of solutions for $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ is given by:\n<<<\n$z_{k,n} = \\frac{i W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k$ and $n$.\nThis set includes:\n1.  The real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions $z_{k,0}$ for integers $k \\le -1$.\n3.  An infinite set of other complex solutions for all other pairs of integers $(k,n)$.\n>>>"
