    "While Kurt Vonnegut used the imagery of a porcupine in his writing, a definitive, widely-cited quote where he describes a specific, named individual as looking \"like a porcupine\" is not readily found in his major published works, interviews, or letters that are easily accessible.\n\nHowever, the name that fits the \"two words that start with the same letter\" clue and is frequently associated with Vonnegut is **Bertolt Brecht**. Vonnegut was a great admirer of the German playwright and was significantly influenced by his work, particularly Brecht's concept of the \"Verfremdungseffekt,\" or \"alienation effect.\"\n\nIn one of his interviews, Vonnegut described a group of soldiers with their bayonets as looking like a \"big porcupine bristling with steel quills,\" demonstrating his use of this particular simile.\n\nGiven the clues, Bertolt Brecht is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<Bertolt Brecht>>>"
