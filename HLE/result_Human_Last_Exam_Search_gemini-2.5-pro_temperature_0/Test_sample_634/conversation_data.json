    "My initial reasoning led to a contradiction. Let's re-evaluate.\n\nThe contradiction arose from:\n1.  The fact that `[P1(0), P2(0)]` has rank 1 (implying they are not right coprime and the GCRD is not unimodular).\n2.  The fact that the intersection of the right null spaces of `P1(0)` and `P2(0)` is the trivial space `{0}`.\n\nThe second point implies that `N(G(0))` must be `{0}`, which means `G(0)` must be invertible and `det(G(0)) != 0`. This contradicts the conclusion from the first point that `det(G)` should have a root at `s=0`.\n\nLet's review the theory. The search results confirm that for a GCRD `G(s)` of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`, it is true that `P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s)` and `P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s)`. This implies that if `G(z)v = 0`, then `P1(z)v = 0` and `P2(z)v = 0`. Therefore, `N(G(z))` is a subspace of the intersection of `N(P1(z))` and `N(P2(z))`. My calculation of the null spaces and their intersection at `s=0` being `{0}` is correct.\n\nThe issue might be in the interpretation of what a GCRD is. A GCRD is not necessarily a square matrix. Let `r` be the normal rank of the stacked matrix `P = [P1; P2]`. A \"compact\" GCRD `G(s)` will have `r` rows.\n\nLet's calculate the rank of the stacked matrix `P(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]`.\n`P(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]`\nThis is a 4x2 matrix. Its rank can be at most 2.\nThe rank is less than 2 if the two columns are linearly dependent.\nThis happens if one column is a multiple of the other.\nLet's check if `[s^2+s; -s^2-1; s; -s-1] = k(s) * [-s; s^2; 0; 1]`.\nFrom the third row: `s = k(s) * 0`, which implies `s=0`.\nLet's check `s=0`:\n`P(0) = [[0, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 0], [-1, 1]]`\nThe first column is `[0; -1; 0; -1]` and the second is `[0; 0; 0; 1]`. These are linearly independent. So the rank of `P(0)` is 2.\n\nThe condition for a GCRD `G(s)` to exist (which is not unimodular) is that the rank of the stacked matrix `P(s)` drops for some value of `s`. These values of `s` are the roots of `det(G(s))`.\nMy calculation shows the rank of `P(s)` is 2 for `s=0`. Let's recheck.\n`P(0) = [[0, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 0], [-1, 1]]`. The submatrix `[[-1, 0], [-1, 1]]` has determinant `-1`, so it has rank 2. The full matrix `P(0)` therefore has rank 2.\n\nLet's re-check the rank of the concatenated matrix `M(s) = [P1(s), P2(s)]`.\n`M(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s, s, 0], [-s^2 - 1, s^2, -s - 1, 1]]`\nAt `s=0`, `M(0) = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, -1, 1]]`. The rank is 1.\nA drop in rank of the *horizontally concatenated* matrix `[P1, P2]` at `s=z` implies that `P1` and `P2` are not right coprime, and that `det(G(z))=0` for any GCRD `G`.\n\nSo, `det(G(0)) = 0`. This brings back the contradiction:\n`N(G(0))` must be a subspace of `N(P1(0)) intersect N(P2(0)) = {0}`.\nThis implies `N(G(0)) = {0}`, which means `G(0)` is invertible, so `det(G(0)) != 0`.\n\nThere must be a flaw in the reasoning chain. Let's re-read the literature.\nThe relationship `P(s) = N(s)G(s)` holds.\nThe relationship about the null spaces seems correct.\n\nLet's try a different method. The Euclidean algorithm for right divisors involves column operations on the transposed matrices, or more generally, row operations on the stacked matrix `P = [P1; P2]` to find a greatest common *left* divisor. To find the GCRD, one can perform row operations on `[P1^T; P2^T]`.\n\nLet `P1^T = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2]]`\nLet `P2^T = [[s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n\nWe form the matrix `M = [P1^T; P2^T]` and use elementary row operations to reduce it to a form `[G^T; 0]`.\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n\nLet's try to simplify this matrix.\nR1 -> R1 - (s+1)*R3\n`[[s^2+s - s(s+1), -s^2-1 - (-s-1)(s+1)], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[0, -s^2-1 + (s+1)^2], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[0, -s^2-1 + s^2+2s+1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[0, 2s], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n\nR2 -> R2 + R3\n`[[0, 2s], [0, s^2-s-1], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n\nR1 -> R1 - 2s*R4\n`[[0, 0], [0, s^2-s-1], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n\nR2 -> R2 - (s^2-s-1)*R4\n`[[0, 0], [0, 0], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n\nNow we have:\n`[[s, -s-1], [0, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0]]`\nThis corresponds to `G^T`.\nSo, `G(s) = [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]`.\n\nThis result is `P2(s)`. Let's check if `P2` is indeed the GCRD.\nIf `G = P2`, then `P2 = I * P2`, so `P2` is a right divisor of `P2`.\nWe need to check if `P2` is a right divisor of `P1`. This means we need to find if there exists a polynomial matrix `Q` such that `P1 = Q * P2`.\n`Q = P1 * P2^(-1)`\n`P2^(-1) = (1/det(P2)) * adj(P2) = (1/s) * [[1, 0], [s+1, s]]`\n`Q = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] * (1/s) * [[1, 0], [s+1, s]]`\n`Q = (1/s) * [[(s^2+s) - s(s+1), -s^2], [(-s^2-1) + s^2(s+1), s^3]]`\n`Q = (1/s) * [[s^2+s - s^2-s, -s^2], [-s^2-1 + s^3+s^2, s^3]]`\n`Q = (1/s) * [[0, -s^2], [s^3-1, s^3]]`\n`Q = [[0, -s], [(s^3-1)/s, s^2]]`\nSince `(s^3-1)/s` is not a polynomial, `Q` is not a polynomial matrix. My calculation was correct, and `P2` is not a right divisor of `P1`.\n\nThis means the row reduction I performed was incorrect. Let's re-do it carefully.\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n\nThe operations must be polynomial.\nR1 <-> R3\n`[[s, -s-1], [-s, s^2], [s^2+s, -s^2-1], [0, 1]]`\n\nR2 -> R2 + R1\nR3 -> R3 - (s+1)R1\n`[[s, -s-1], [0, s^2-s-1], [0, (-s^2-1) - (s+1)(-s-1)], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[s, -s-1], [0, s^2-s-1], [0, -s^2-1 + (s+1)^2], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[s, -s-1], [0, s^2-s-1], [0, -s^2-1 + s^2+2s+1], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[s, -s-1], [0, s^2-s-1], [0, 2s], [0, 1]]`\n\nNow focus on the second column for rows 2, 3, 4.\n`[[s^2-s-1], [2s], [1]]`\nWe can use the `1` in R4 to eliminate the entries in R2 and R3.\nR2 -> R2 - (s^2-s-1)R4\nR3 -> R3 - 2s*R4\n`[[s, -s-1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nR1 -> R1 + (s+1)R4\n`[[s, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nAfter reordering rows:\n`[[s, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0]]`\nThis is the reduced form `G^T`.\nSo, `G(s) = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n\nLet's check if this `G(s)` is the GCRD.\n1.  Is `G` a right divisor of `P1`?\n    `P1 = Q1 * G` => `Q1 = P1 * G^(-1)`\n    `G^(-1) = (1/s) * [[1, 0], [0, s]] = [[1/s, 0], [0, 1]]`. This is not a polynomial matrix. The inverse must be over the ring of polynomials. `det(G) = s`, so it's not unimodular.\n    Let's check `Q1 = P1 * G_adj / det(G)`\n    `Q1 = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] * [[1, 0], [0, s]] * (1/s)`\n    `Q1 = [[s^2+s, -s^2], [-s^2-1, s^3]] * (1/s)`\n    `Q1 = [[s+1, -s], [(-s^2-1)/s, s^2]]`\n    This is not a polynomial matrix. So `G(s) = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]` is not a right divisor of `P1`.\n\nThere is something fundamentally wrong in my application of the methods. Let's reconsider the contradiction.\n- `[P1(0), P2(0)]` has rank 1. This implies P1 and P2 are not right coprime. GCRD is not unimodular. `det(G)` must have roots. The common roots of all highest-order minors of `[P1, P2]` are the roots of `det(G)`.\n- Minors of `[P1, P2]`:\n    - `det(P1) = s(s^3-1)`\n    - `det(P2) = s`\n    - `s(2s^2+s+1)`\n    - `s(s+1)`\n    - `-s(s^2-s-1)`\n    - `-s`\n- The common factor of all these minors is `s`. So the only root of `det(G)` is `s=0`.\n- `N(P1(0)) = span{[0; 1]}`\n- `N(P2(0)) = span{[1; 1]}`\n- `N(P1(0)) intersect N(P2(0)) = {0}`\n- `N(G(0))` must be a subspace of `{0}`, so `N(G(0)) = {0}`.\n- This implies `G(0)` is invertible, so `det(G(0)) != 0`.\n- This is the contradiction.\n\nLet's search for an explanation of this paradox. It's possible the theorem `N(G(z)) subset of N(P1(z)) intersect N(P2(z))` has subtleties I'm missing.\nWhat if the GCRD is a non-square matrix?\nLet `G` be a `1x2` matrix. `G = [g1(s), g2(s)]`.\n`det(G)` is not defined. The theory about determinants applies to square GCRDs.\nThe rank of the GCRD must be equal to the normal rank of `[P1; P2]`.\nThe normal rank of `P(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]` is 2, as `P(0)` has rank 2.\nSo the GCRD `G(s)` must have rank 2. A GCRD is typically chosen to be \"compact\", meaning it has `r` rows, where `r` is the rank. So we are looking for a `2x2` GCRD. It must be a square matrix.\n\nLet's reconsider the row reduction of `[P1^T; P2^T]`. This is the standard algorithm. There must be a mistake in my check.\n`G(s) = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nLet's check if `G` is a right divisor of `P1` and `P2`.\n`P1 = Q1 * G` => `[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = [[q11, q12], [q21, q22]] * [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`\n`[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = [[s*q11, q12], [s*q21, q22]]`\nEquating elements:\n`q12 = -s`\n`q22 = s^2`\n`s*q11 = s^2+s = s(s+1)` => `q11 = s+1`\n`s*q21 = -s^2-1` => `q21 = (-s^2-1)/s = -s - 1/s`.\nThis is not a polynomial. So `G` is not a right divisor of `P1`.\n\nMy row reduction must be wrong. Let's try again.\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\nLet's use the last row to simplify the second column.\nR1 -> R1 + (s^2+1)R4\nR2 -> R2 - s^2*R4\nR3 -> R3 + (s+1)R4\n`[[s^2+s, 0], [-s, 0], [s, 0], [0, 1]]`\nThis looks much simpler.\nNow we have three rows with a zero in the second column.\n`[[s^2+s], [-s], [s]]`\nWe can perform row operations on these.\nLet's call the new rows R1', R2', R3'.\nR1' -> R1' + s*R2'\n`[[s^2+s - s^2, 0], [-s, 0], [s, 0], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[s, 0], [-s, 0], [s, 0], [0, 1]]`\nR2' -> R2' + R1'\nR3' -> R3' - R1'\n`[[s, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\nReordering gives:\n`[[s, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0]]`\nThis is the same result as before. The row reduction seems correct.\n\nWhy does the check `P1 = Q1 * G` fail?\n`Q1 = [[s+1, -s], [-s - 1/s, s^2]]`\nThe division algorithm for polynomial matrices states `P1 = Q1*G + R1` where the degree of `R1` is less than the degree of `G`.\nMaybe I am checking it wrong.\nLet `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nLet's try to find `Q1` and `Q2` such that `P1 = Q1*G` and `P2 = Q2*G`.\n`P1 = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]]`.\nLet `Q1 = [[a(s), b(s)], [c(s), d(s)]]`.\n`Q1*G = [[a, b], [c, d]] * [[s, 0], [0, 1]] = [[s*a, b], [s*c, d]]`.\nComparing with `P1`:\n`b(s) = -s`\n`d(s) = s^2`\n`s*a(s) = s^2+s` => `a(s) = s+1`\n`s*c(s) = -s^2-1`. Here `c(s) = -s - 1/s`. This is where it fails. `c(s)` must be a polynomial.\n\nLet's check `P2`.\n`P2 = [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]`.\n`Q2*G = [[s*a', b'], [s*c', d']]`.\n`b'(s) = 0`\n`d'(s) = 1`\n`s*a'(s) = s` => `a'(s) = 1`\n`s*c'(s) = -s-1` => `c'(s) = -1 - 1/s`.\nThis also fails.\n\nThis means `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]` is not a GCRD.\nThe Euclidean algorithm on the transposed matrices should yield the GCRD. What is wrong?\nThe operations must be elementary row operations. An elementary row operation is one of:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a *polynomial* multiple of one row to another.\n\nLet's re-re-do the reduction.\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\nThis is `[P1^T; P2^T]`.\nLet's try to make it upper triangular.\nSwap R1 and R3.\n`[[s, -s-1], [-s, s^2], [s^2+s, -s^2-1], [0, 1]]`\nR2 -> R2 + R1\nR3 -> R3 - (s+1)R1\n`[[s, -s-1], [0, s^2-s-1], [0, (-s^2-1) - (s+1)(-s-1)], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[s, -s-1], [0, s^2-s-1], [0, -s^2-1 + (s+1)^2], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[s, -s-1], [0, s^2-s-1], [0, 2s], [0, 1]]`\nThis is correct so far. Let's call the rows R1', R2', R3', R4'.\nNow we need to work on the second column of R2', R3', R4'.\nThe entries are `s^2-s-1`, `2s`, `1`.\nWe can use R4' to eliminate R2' and R3'.\nR2' -> R2' - (s^2-s-1)R4'\nR3' -> R3' - (2s)R4'\nThe matrix becomes:\n`[[s, -s-1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\nThis is correct. Now we use the new R4' (which is `[0, 1]`) to eliminate the `-s-1` in R1'.\nR1' -> R1' + (s+1)R4'\n`[[s, -s-1 + (s+1)*1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[s, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\nReordering gives `[[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n\nThe algorithm seems to be correctly applied. The result seems to be `G(s) = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nWhy does the check fail?\nIs it possible that the GCRD is `P2` and my check for `P1 = Q*P2` was wrong?\n`Q = (1/s) * [[0, -s^2], [s^3-1, s^3]] = [[0, -s], [(s^3-1)/s, s^2]]`.\nNo, this is definitely not a polynomial matrix.\n\nLet's try to find a common right divisor by inspection.\nLet `G = [[s, 0], [-1, 1]]`.\n`det(G) = s`.\nLet's check if this divides `P2`.\n`P2 = Q2 * G` => `[[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]] = Q2 * [[s, 0], [-1, 1]]`\n`Q2 = P2 * G^(-1) = [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]] * (1/s) * [[1, 0], [1, s]]`\n`Q2 = (1/s) * [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]] * [[1, 0], [1, s]]`\n`Q2 = (1/s) * [[s, 0], [-s-1+1, s]] = (1/s) * [[s, 0], [-s, s]] = [[1, 0], [-1, 1]]`.\nThis is a polynomial matrix. So `G` is a right divisor of `P2`.\n\nNow let's check if `G` divides `P1`.\n`P1 = Q1 * G` => `Q1 = P1 * G^(-1)`\n`Q1 = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] * (1/s) * [[1, 0], [1, s]]`\n`Q1 = (1/s) * [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] * [[1, 0], [1, s]]`\n`Q1 = (1/s) * [[s^2+s-s, -s^2], [-s^2-1+s^2, s^3]]`\n`Q1 = (1/s) * [[s^2, -s^2], [-1, s^3]]`\n`Q1 = [[s, -s], [-1/s, s^2]]`.\nThis is not a polynomial matrix. So `G = [[s, 0], [-1, 1]]` is not a right divisor of `P1`.\n\nLet's try `G = [[1, 0], [s+1, -s]]`. `det(G) = -s`.\nLet's try `G = [[s, -1], [0, s]]`. `det(G) = s^2`. This doesn't divide `det(P2) = s`.\n\nLet's reconsider the Euclidean algorithm result: `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nAnd the check: `s*c(s) = -s^2-1`.\nThis equation comes from `P1 = Q1 * G`.\n`[-s^2-1, s^2]` is the second row of `P1`.\n`[s*c(s), d(s)]` is the second row of `Q1*G`.\nSo `d(s) = s^2` and `s*c(s) = -s^2-1`.\nThis implies `c(s)` is not a polynomial.\nThis is undeniable.\n\nSo, one of three things is true:\n1.  The Euclidean algorithm on the transposed matrices does not work for GCRD. (Unlikely, it's a standard method).\n2.  I have made a mistake in the row reduction. (Possible, let's check again).\n3.  I have made a mistake in the check. (How?)\n\nLet's check the row reduction again.\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\nLet's try a different sequence of operations.\nR1 -> R1 - (s)R2\n`[[s^2+s - s(-s), -s^2-1 - s(s^2)], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\n`[[2s^2+s, -s^3-s^2-1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\nThis seems to be increasing the degree, which is not the goal.\n\nLet's go back to the version that reduced degrees.\n`M_reduced = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]` (after reordering).\nThis matrix is `U * M` where `U` is a unimodular matrix representing the row operations.\n`U * [P1^T; P2^T] = [G^T; 0]`.\nThis means `G^T` is a greatest common left divisor of `P1^T` and `P2^T`.\nBy definition, this means `P1^T = GCLD_1 * G^T` and `P2^T = GCLD_2 * G^T`.\nTaking the transpose: `P1 = G * GCLD_1^T` and `P2 = G * GCLD_2^T`.\nThis means `G` is a common *left* divisor of `P1` and `P2`.\n\nAh, I have confused the algorithm.\n- To find the GCLD of A and B, perform row operations on `[A; B]` to get `[G; 0]`.\n- To find the GCRD of A and B, perform *column* operations on `[A, B]` to get `[G, 0]`.\n\nLet's perform column operations on `M = [P1, P2]`.\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0], [-s^2-1, s^2, -s-1, 1]]`\nThe goal is to reduce this to `[G, 0]` where G is 2x2.\nC1 -> C1 - (s+1)C3\nC2 -> C2 + C3\n`[[s^2+s-s(s+1), -s+s, s, 0], [-s^2-1-(-s-1)(s+1), s^2+(-s-1), -s-1, 1]]`\n`[[0, 0, s, 0], [-s^2-1+(s+1)^2, s^2-s-1, -s-1, 1]]`\n`[[0, 0, s, 0], [-s^2-1+s^2+2s+1, s^2-s-1, -s-1, 1]]`\n`[[0, 0, s, 0], [2s, s^2-s-1, -s-1, 1]]`\n\nNow we can use C4 to eliminate other columns.\nC1 -> C1 - (2s)C4\nC2 -> C2 - (s^2-s-1)C4\nC3 -> C3 - (-s-1)C4 = C3 + (s+1)C4\n`[[0, 0, s, 0], [2s-2s, s^2-s-1-(s^2-s-1), -s-1+(s+1), 1]]`\n`[[0, 0, s, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]`\nThis doesn't look like `[G, 0]`. The result should be a 2x2 matrix G and a 2x2 zero matrix.\n\nLet's try to get the zeros in C3 and C4.\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0], [-s^2-1, s^2, -s-1, 1]]`\nC3 -> C3 + C4*(s+1)\n`[[s^2+s, -s, s, 0], [-s^2-1 + (s+1), s^2, -s-1+(s+1), 1]]`\n`[[s^2+s, -s, s, 0], [-s^2+s, s^2, 0, 1]]`\nC1 -> C1 - s*C3\nC2 -> C2 + C3\n`[[s^2+s-s^2, -s+s, s, 0], [-s^2+s - s(s^2), s^2+s^2, 0, 1]]`\n`[[s, 0, s, 0], [-s^3-s^2+s, 2s^2, 0, 1]]`\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's reconsider the contradiction.\n`det(G(0)) = 0` and `N(G(0)) = {0}`.\nThis is a genuine contradiction. Let me check the definition of the null space of a GCRD.\nThe property `N(G(z)) subset of intersection(N(Pi(z)))` is correct.\nThe calculation of the null spaces at s=0 is correct.\nThe calculation of their intersection being {0} is correct.\nThe conclusion that `N(G(0)) = {0}` and thus `det(G(0)) != 0` is correct.\nThe calculation that the rank of `[P1(0), P2(0)]` is 1 is correct.\nThe theorem that if `[P1, P2]` drops rank at `s=z`, then `det(G(z))=0` for any square GCRD `G` is correct.\n\nWhere could the error be?\nMaybe the GCRD is not square? But the rank of `[P1; P2]` is 2. So a compact GCRD should be 2x2.\nWhat if `P1` and `P2` are right coprime despite the rank drop?\nThe definition of right coprime is that the GCRD is unimodular.\nThe condition for right coprimeness is that `[P1(s), P2(s)]` has full row rank for all `s`.\nWe found `rank([P1(0), P2(0)]) = 1 < 2`. So they are not right coprime. The GCRD is not unimodular.\n\nThis contradiction is puzzling. Let's try one more time to find a divisor by hand.\nLet's assume the GCRD is `G = [[s, a], [b, c]]`. `det(G) = sc - ab`. We expect `det(G(0)) = 0`, so `-ab(0) = 0`.\nLet's try `G = [[s, 0], [-1, 1]]` again. My check showed it was not a right divisor of P1 because `Q1 = [[s, -s], [-1/s, s^2]]`.\nLet's re-calculate `P1 * G_inv`.\n`G_inv = (1/s) * [[1, 0], [1, s]]`.\n`P1 * G_inv = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] * (1/s) * [[1, 0], [1, s]]`\n`= (1/s) * [[(s^2+s) - s, (-s)*s], [(-s^2-1) + s^2, s^2*s]]`\n`= (1/s) * [[s^2, -s^2], [-1, s^3]]`\n`= [[s, -s], [-1/s, s^2]]`.\nThe calculation is correct. It's not a divisor.\n\nWhat if the GCRD from the Euclidean algorithm was `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]` and my check was flawed?\n`P1 = Q1 * G`. `Q1` must be a polynomial matrix.\n`[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = Q1 * [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nLet the columns of `P1` be `p11, p12`. Let the columns of `Q1` be `q11, q12`.\nThen `p11 = q11 * s` and `p12 = q12 * 1`.\n`q12 = p12 = [-s; s^2]`. This is a polynomial vector.\n`q11 = p11 / s = [[s^2+s]/s; [-s^2-1]/s] = [[s+1]; [-s - 1/s]]`.\nThis is not a polynomial vector. The check is correct. The result from the Euclidean algorithm is not a right divisor.\n\nThis implies my application of the Euclidean algorithm is wrong.\nLet's look at the algorithm again. `U * [P1^T; P2^T] = [G^T; 0]`. This gives a GCLD of the transposed matrices. A GCLD of `A^T` and `B^T` is the transpose of a GCRD of `A` and `B`.\nSo `GCLD(P1^T, P2^T) = (GCRD(P1, P2))^T`.\nThe algorithm is correct. The execution of the algorithm gave `G^T = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nThe execution must be wrong.\n\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`\nLet's use R4 to clear the second column.\nR1 -> R1 + (s^2+1)R4\nR2 -> R2 - s^2*R4\nR3 -> R3 + (s+1)R4\n`[[s^2+s, 0], [-s, 0], [s, 0], [0, 1]]`\nThis is correct. Let's call the first three rows R1', R2', R3'.\n`R1' = [s(s+1), 0]`\n`R2' = [-s, 0]`\n`R3' = [s, 0]`\nThe gcd of the first elements is `s`. We should be able to get `[s, 0]` and `[0, 0]` from these.\nR2' -> -1 * R2' gives `[s, 0]`. Let's call this R2''.\nR1' -> R1' - (s+1)R2'' = `[s(s+1), 0] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [0, 0]`.\nR3' -> R3' - R2'' = `[s, 0] - [s, 0] = [0, 0]`.\nSo we are left with `[s, 0]` and `[0, 1]`.\nThe resulting matrix is `[[s, 0], [0, 1]]`. The execution seems correct.\n\nI am stuck between a correct algorithm giving a result that fails a correct check, and a theoretical contradiction. Let me try to find the GCRD by another method.\nA matrix `R(s)` is a right divisor of `P(s)` if `P(s)R(s)^-1` is a proper rational matrix (this is for state-space methods, maybe not helpful).\n\nLet's assume the GCRD is `P2 = [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]`.\nThe check failed. `Q = P1 * P2_inv` was not polynomial.\n`Q = [[0, -s], [(s^3-1)/s, s^2]]`.\nLet's look at the division with remainder. `P1 = Q*P2 + R`.\nIf we define `Q_poly = [[0, -s], [s^2, s^2]]`, then\n`Q_poly * P2 = [[0, -s], [s^2, s^2]] * [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]`\n`= [[s(s+1), -s], [s^3 - s^2(s+1), s^2]]`\n`= [[s^2+s, -s], [s^3 - s^3-s^2, s^2]]`\n`= [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2, s^2]]`\n`R = P1 - Q_poly*P2 = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] - [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2, s^2]]`\n`= [[0, 0], [-1, 0]]`.\nThe remainder is not zero. So `P2` is not a right divisor of `P1`.\n\nLet's try the other way. Is `P1` a right divisor of `P2`?\n`det(P1) = s(s^3-1)`. `det(P2) = s`. `det(P1)` does not divide `det(P2)`. So `P1` cannot be a right divisor of `P2`.\n\nLet's reconsider the Euclidean algorithm result `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n`P1 = Q1*G + R1`.\n`Q1_poly = [[s+1, -s], [-s, s^2]]`.\n`Q1_poly * G = [[s+1, -s], [-s, s^2]] * [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`\n`= [[s(s+1), -s], [-s^2, s^2]]`\n`R1 = P1 - Q1_poly*G = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] - [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2, s^2]]`\n`= [[0, 0], [-1, 0]]`.\nRemainder is not zero.\n\nThere is a mistake in my understanding or application of the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. The algorithm should be correct.\nLet's look at the final matrix from the reduction: `[[s, 0], [0, 1]]`. This is `G^T`.\nThis means `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nThe algorithm states that this `G` is a GCRD.\nWhy does the divisibility check fail?\n`P1 = QG`. `s*c(s) = -s^2-1`. `c(s) = -s - 1/s`.\nThis is a fact. `Q` is not a polynomial matrix.\nThis means `G` is not a right divisor.\n\nCould the GCRD be `I` (the identity matrix)?\nIf GCRD is `I`, they are right coprime.\nBut `[P1(0), P2(0)]` is rank deficient. So they are not right coprime.\n\nLet's try to find a unimodular matrix `V` such that `[P1, P2]V = [G, 0]`.\nThis is the column version of the Euclidean algorithm.\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0], [-s^2-1, s^2, -s-1, 1]]`\nC1 -> C1 - (s+1)C3\nC2 -> C2 + C3\n`[[0, 0, s, 0], [2s, s^2-s-1, -s-1, 1]]`\nC3 -> C3 + (s+1)C4\n`[[0, 0, s, 0], [2s, s^2-s-1, 0, 1]]`\nC1 -> C1 - 2s*C4\nC2 -> C2 - (s^2-s-1)C4\n`[[0, 0, s, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]`\nThis gives `[G, 0]` where `G = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]` and the other part is `[[s, 0], [0, 1]]`. This is not the right form.\n\nLet's try to get the non-zero part on the left.\n`M = [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0], [-s^2-1, s^2, -s-1, 1]]`\nSwap C1 and C3.\n`[[s, -s, s^2+s, 0], [-s-1, s^2, -s^2-1, 1]]`\nC2 -> C2 + C1\nC3 -> C3 - s*C1\n`[[s, 0, s^2+s-s^2, 0], [-s-1, s^2-s-1, -s^2-1-s(-s-1), 1]]`\n`[[s, 0, s, 0], [-s-1, s^2-s-1, -s^2-1+s^2+s, 1]]`\n`[[s, 0, s, 0], [-s-1, s^2-s-1, s-1, 1]]`\nC3 -> C3 - C1\n`[[s, 0, 0, 0], [-s-1, s^2-s-1, s-1-(-s-1), 1]]`\n`[[s, 0, 0, 0], [-s-1, s^2-s-1, 2s, 1]]`\nNow use C4 to clear C2 and C3.\nC2 -> C2 - (s^2-s-1)C4\nC3 -> C3 - 2s*C4\n`[[s, -(s^2-s-1), -2s, 0], [-s-1, 0, 0, 1]]`\nThis is getting messy and doesn't seem to lead to `[G, 0]`.\n\nLet's trust the row-reduction on the transpose. The result is `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nThere must be a reason why the check `P1 = QG` fails.\nThe definition of polynomial matrix division is `A = QD + R` where `R D^-1` is strictly proper. Or for this case, `A = DQ + R` where `D^-1 R` is strictly proper.\nLet's use the column version. `A = QD + R`.\n`P1 = Q1 * G`.\n`[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = Q1 * [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nThis is what I checked. `q11 = s+1`, `q12 = -s`, `q22 = s^2`, `q21 = -s - 1/s`.\nThe division is not exact.\n\nLet's try to find the GCRD of the rows of `M = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`.\nThe GCRD of these four rows is `[s, 0]` and `[0, 1]`. This is what the algorithm finds.\nThis GCRD is a basis for the module generated by the rows.\nAny row `r_i` can be written as a linear combination `r_i = a_i * [s, 0] + b_i * [0, 1]`.\n`r1 = [s^2+s, -s^2-1]`. `a1 = s+1`. `b1 = -s^2-1`. This works.\n`r2 = [-s, s^2]`. `a2 = -1`. `b2 = s^2`. This works.\n`r3 = [s, -s-1]`. `a3 = 1`. `b3 = -s-1`. This works.\n`r4 = [0, 1]`. `a4 = 0`. `b4 = 1`. This works.\nSo `G^T = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]` is a basis for the module generated by the rows of `[P1^T, P2^T]`. This is the definition of the GCLD of the transposed matrices.\n\nSo `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]` is the GCRD.\nWhy does the check `P1 = QG` fail?\nThe relationship is `P_i^T = K_i * G^T` for some polynomial matrix `K_i`.\n`P1^T = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2]]`.\n`G^T = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n`K1 * G^T = [[k11, k12], [k21, k22]] * [[s, 0], [0, 1]] = [[s*k11, k12], [s*k21, k22]]`.\n`k12 = -s^2-1`. `k22 = s^2`.\n`s*k11 = s^2+s` => `k11 = s+1`.\n`s*k21 = -s` => `k21 = -1`.\nHere, `K1 = [[s+1, -s^2-1], [-1, s^2]]` is a polynomial matrix.\nSo `P1^T = K1 * G^T`. Taking transpose, `P1 = G * K1^T`.\n`K1^T = [[s+1, -1], [-s^2-1, s^2]]`.\nLet's check this:\n`G * K1^T = [[s, 0], [0, 1]] * [[s+1, -1], [-s^2-1, s^2]]`\n`= [[s(s+1), s(-1)], [1(-s^2-1), 1(s^2)]]`\n`= [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]]`.\nThis is `P1`. It works.\n\nNow for `P2`.\n`P2^T = K2 * G^T`.\n`P2^T = [[s, -s-1], [0, 1]]`.\n`[[s, -s-1], [0, 1]] = [[s*k'11, k'12], [s*k'21, k'22]]`.\n`k'12 = -s-1`. `k'22 = 1`.\n`s*k'11 = s` => `k'11 = 1`.\n`s*k'21 = 0` => `k'21 = 0`.\n`K2 = [[1, -s-1], [0, 1]]` is a polynomial matrix.\n`P2 = G * K2^T`.\n`K2^T = [[1, 0], [-s-1, 1]]`.\nCheck:\n`G * K2^T = [[s, 0], [0, 1]] * [[1, 0], [-s-1, 1]]`\n`= [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]`.\nThis is `P2`. It also works.\n\nSo `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]` is a common right divisor.\nThe algorithm ensures it is the greatest common right divisor.\nMy check was flawed. I was trying to solve `P = QG` but the relationship is `P^T = K G^T`, which is `P = G K^T`. The factor matrix is the transpose of what I was trying to find.\n\nFinal answer is `G = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n\n<<<[[s, 0],]>>>"
