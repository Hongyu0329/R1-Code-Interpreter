    "John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* primarily draws its characters from the Bible. While the term \"saints\" is used in a general sense to refer to the righteous in Heaven, only two historical figures who are also considered saints in various Christian traditions are mentioned by name.\n\nThe named historical saints are:\n\n*   **Joshua:** In Book XII, the Archangel Michael, while narrating future events to Adam, mentions Joshua. Michael explains that Joshua, whom he notes is called Jesus by the Gentiles, will lead the Israelites into Canaan, prefiguring the later coming of Jesus Christ.\n*   **Josiah:** In Book I, Milton refers to the good king Josiah of Judah. The poem notes that Josiah drove out the pagan rites of Moloch from the land.\n\nThe poem's focus remains on the foundational biblical narrative of the Fall of Man, and therefore, it does not include references to post-biblical, canonized saints of the Catholic or Orthodox traditions. The narrative is populated with biblical figures such as Adam, Eve, and various angels like Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, alongside the central figures of God and Satan.\n\n<<<2>>>"
