    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, yellow, red, violet, and black.\n\nPhosphorus has several allotropes, each with unique properties and appearances. The most common forms are white and red phosphorus.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** In its pure form, it is a white, waxy solid. However, upon exposure to light or in the presence of impurities, it can appear pale yellow, leading to it also being referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is known for its characteristic red color.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline form is described as being red-purple or violet.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** As the most thermodynamically stable allotrope, it has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite. There are two forms, α-black and β-black phosphorus.\n*   **Scarlet Phosphorus:** This is another recognized allotropic form of phosphorus.\n\nWhile some sources may describe variations in luster or shade, such as an \"iron-grey\" appearance for red or black phosphorus, the fundamental observable colors of the pure allotropes are white (or yellow), red, violet, black, and scarlet.\n\n<<<5>>>"
