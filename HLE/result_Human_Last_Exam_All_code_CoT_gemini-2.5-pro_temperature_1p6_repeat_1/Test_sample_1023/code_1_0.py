# Step 1: Explain the components of the extinction rates.
# The extinction rate for an evolutionary species is mu_e.
# The extinction rate for a morphospecies (mu_m) is the sum of the rates of all
# events that cause a morphospecies to cease to exist.
# mu_m = (true extinction) + (pseudoextinction) + (replacement by bifurcation)
# mu_m = mu_e + p + 0.5 * lambda_e
# where lambda_e is the branching rate, mu_e is the true extinction rate,
# and p is the rate of pseudoextinction from anagenesis.

# Step 2: Apply the central assumption from the problem.
# "Assume that for both evolutionary species and morphospecies, all the processes
# that affect them occur at the same rates."
# This is interpreted to mean that the fundamental rates (lambda_e, mu_e, and p) are equal.
# To calculate the ratio, we can set this common rate to any positive value, e.g., 1.
r = 1.0
lambda_e = r
mu_e = r
p = r

# Step 3: Calculate the extinction rate for a morphospecies using these values.
mu_m = mu_e + p + 0.5 * lambda_e

# Step 4: Calculate the final ratio.
# This is the extinction rate of a morphospecies compared to that of an evolutionary species.
multiplicative_factor = mu_m / mu_e

# Step 5: Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final answer.
