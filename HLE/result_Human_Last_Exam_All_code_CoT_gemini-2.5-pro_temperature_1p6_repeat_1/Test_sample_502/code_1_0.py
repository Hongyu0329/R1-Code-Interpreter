    Calculates the largest possible dimension for the quotient ring R/I.

    The dimension of the coinvariant algebra R/I is equal to the order of the group H
    that acts effectively on the vector space. H is the image of the representation rho.
    dim(R/I) = |H| = |G| / |ker(rho)|.
    To maximize this dimension, we need to maximize |H|.
    Given |G| = 10000, the maximum possible value for |H| is 10000,
    which occurs when the representation rho is faithful (ker(rho) is trivial).

    A faithful 10-dimensional representation of a group of order 10000 exists.
    For example, the cyclic group C_10000 can be faithfully represented in GL_10(C).
    Thus, the maximum possible dimension is the order of the group G.
