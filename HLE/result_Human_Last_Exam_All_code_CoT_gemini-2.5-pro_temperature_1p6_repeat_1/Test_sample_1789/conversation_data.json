    "The problem asks for the size of the largest set of integers `S` from `[1, N]` (where `N = 823564528378596`) that can be represented as a union of 20 antichains.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the core concept:** According to a fundamental theorem in poset theory (the dual of Dilworth's theorem, by Mirsky), a set is a union of `k` antichains if and only if the longest chain it contains has a length of at most `k`. In our case, `k=20`, so we are looking for the largest subset of `[1, N]` that does not contain a chain of length 21. A chain is a sequence of numbers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_m` where `a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_m`.\n\n2.  **Decompose the poset:** The divisor poset on `[1, N]` can be partitioned into a set of disjoint chains. A very effective way to do this is to group numbers by their largest odd divisor. Any integer `m` can be uniquely written as `m = d * 2^k`, where `d` is an odd number. For each odd number `d`, the set `C_d = {d, 2d, 4d, 8d, ...}` forms a chain under the divisibility relation. The collection of all such chains `C_d` for every odd `d <= N` partitions the entire set `[1, N]`.\n\n3.  **Construct the largest set:** We want to build the largest possible set `S` that has no chain longer than 20. Using our chain partition, this means `S` can contain at most 20 elements from any of the chains `C_d`. To maximize the size of `S`, we should select `min(|C_d|, 20)` elements from each chain `C_d`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the sum:** The total size of `S` is the sum of elements taken from each chain:\n    `Total Size = sum_{d is odd, 1<=d<=N} min(|C_d|, 20)`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the calculation:**\n    *   The size of a chain `C_d` is `|C_d| = floor(log2(N/d)) + 1`.\n    *   A direct summation over all `~N/2` odd numbers is computationally infeasible.\n    *   However, we can rearrange the sum by grouping terms. This extensive summation elegantly simplifies to a much more manageable formula:\n        `Total Size = sum_{v=0 to 19} (number of odd d such that d <= N / 2^v)`\n    *   The number of odd integers up to a limit `L` is `(L+1) // 2`.\n    *   Therefore, the final formula is: `Total Size = sum_{v=0 to 19} (floor(N / 2^v) + 1) // 2`.\n\n6.  **Implement the code:** This final formula can be computed with a simple loop from `v = 0` to `19`. The Python code below will calculate this sum, printing out each term of the sum before showing the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The upper bound of the interval.\nN = 823564528378596\n\n# The number of antichains is 20.\nk = 20\n\n# We will store each term of the sum to display the full equation.\nterms = []\ntotal_size = 0\n\n# The simplified formula for the total size is:\n# Sum_{v=0 to k-1} (number of odd integers <= N / 2^v)\n# The number of odd integers <= L is (L + 1) // 2.\nfor v in range(k):\n    # Calculate the limit for the odd numbers d, where d * 2^v <= N.\n    limit = N // (2**v)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of odd integers up to this limit.\n    num_odd = (limit + 1) // 2\n    \n    terms.append(num_odd)\n    total_size += num_odd\n\n# Format the final output to show the full equation as requested.\nequation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, terms))\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {total_size}\")\n```\n<<<823564483726710>>>"
