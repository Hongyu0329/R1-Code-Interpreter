    This function determines the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers
    with no nontrivial convergent sequences.

    Let G be the group of integers (Z, +).
    1.  A group topology on G is 'totally bounded' if for every open neighborhood U of 0,
        there is a finite set {g_1, ..., g_n} in G such that G = g_1*U U ... U g_n*U.
        On Z, this implies that the topology has a basis of neighborhoods at 0 consisting of
        subgroups of finite index. These subgroups are of the form nZ for n in N*.
        Let S be the set of all n such that nZ is an open neighborhood of 0.

    2.  The topology is 'Hausdorff' (a standard assumption for such problems) if the
        intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 is {0}. This means intersect_{n in S} (nZ) = {0}.
        This holds if and only if the least common multiple of all integers in S is infinite
        (lcm(S) = infinity).

    3.  The condition of having 'no nontrivial convergent sequences' means that if a sequence
        x_k converges to 0, it must be eventually 0. This makes the topology a 'P-space'.
        For a group topology with a basis of subgroups, this property is equivalent to the following condition on S:
        For any countable subset A from S, lcm(A) must divide some element m in S.

    4.  From the P-space condition, we can show that lcm(S) must be a finite number.
        - If the set of prime factors of numbers in S were infinite, we could construct a countable
          subset A from S whose lcm has infinitely many prime factors, and thus cannot divide any
          finite integer m from S.
        - Similarly, for each prime p, the set of exponents v_p(n) for n in S must be bounded.
        - These two facts together imply that all numbers in S must divide some large number N,
          which means lcm(S) must be finite.

    5.  The Hausdorff condition requires lcm(S) to be infinite, while the P-space condition requires
        lcm(S) to be finite. These two conditions are contradictory.

    Therefore, no such topology can exist. The number is 0.
