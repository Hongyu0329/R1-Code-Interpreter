# The ranking reflects the general consensus in sound design for creating an immersive and effective scene.

# 1. Music: The primary driver of the scene, providing rhythm and emotion.
# 2. Sound Effects: Add realism, texture, and impact to the movements.
# 3. Speech: Usually minimal or absent to prioritize the musical and visual storytelling.
