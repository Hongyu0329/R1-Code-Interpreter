    "In film production, the hierarchy of sound in a dance scene is determined by what drives the narrative and emotional core of the scene. My plan is to analyze the role of each sound element—music, sound effects, and speech—within the context of a dance sequence to establish their order of importance.\n\n1.  **Music:** In a dance scene, music is almost always the most important element. It provides the rhythm, tempo, and emotional foundation for the choreography. The dance is created and performed *to* the music, making it the primary driver of the scene's energy and storytelling.\n2.  **Sound Effects (SFX):** These are the next most important. SFX, such as the sound of tap shoes on a floor, the swish of a dress, or synchronized clapping, add a layer of realism and texture. They ground the dance in a physical space and make the movements feel more impactful and tangible to the audience.\n3.  **Speech:** Typically, speech or dialogue is the least important sound element *during* a dance number. The storytelling is primarily visual and musical. If characters speak, their lines are often brief and mixed lower than the music so as not to distract from the performance itself.\n\nBased on this breakdown, the script below will print the final ranked order.\n\n```python\n# This script defines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance for a typical dance scene in film.\n# The ranking reflects the general consensus in sound design for creating an immersive and effective scene.\n\n# 1. Music: The primary driver of the scene, providing rhythm and emotion.\n# 2. Sound Effects: Add realism, texture, and impact to the movements.\n# 3. Speech: Usually minimal or absent to prioritize the musical and visual storytelling.\n\nsound_hierarchy = \"Music, Sound Effects, Speech\"\nprint(sound_hierarchy)\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
