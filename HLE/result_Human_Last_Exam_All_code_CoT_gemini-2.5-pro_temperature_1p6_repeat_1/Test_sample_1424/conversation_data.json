    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will explain the physical context of the bare Green's function, $G_0$. It's a fundamental concept in quantum many-body physics that describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle.\n\nSecond, I'll state that the relationship you're asking about is most clearly and commonly expressed in the frequency-momentum domain. The function is written as $G_0(k, \\omega)$, where $k$ is the particle's momentum (or set of quantum numbers) and $\\omega$ is its frequency (or energy).\n\nThird, I will present the standard mathematical formula for the (retarded) bare Green's function at zero temperature, which is derived from the path integral formalism: $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$.\n\nFourth, I will clearly define each variable in the formula ($\\omega, \\epsilon_k, \\mu, i\\delta$) to ensure there is no ambiguity.\n\nFinally, I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically construct and print this equation. This approach perfectly aligns with the request to \"output each number in the final equation\" by displaying all the symbolic variables that constitute the formula.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef green_function_dependence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and displays the functional dependence of the bare\n    Green's function on single-particle energy eigenvalues using symbolic math.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables used in the Green's function formula.\n    # Using Greek letters for a clearer representation.\n    omega, epsilon_k, mu, delta = sympy.symbols('ω ϵ_k μ δ', real=True, positive=True)\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n    i = sympy.I # The imaginary unit\n\n    # The bare Green's function G_0 is the inverse of the operator in the\n    # quadratic part of the action in the path integral.\n    # For a non-interacting system with Hamiltonian H_0 = Σ_k ϵ_k c_k† c_k,\n    # the inverse of the retarded Green's function in the frequency domain is:\n    # [G_0(k, ω)]⁻¹ = ω - (ϵ_k - μ) + iδ\n    #\n    # Therefore, the Green's function itself is:\n    # G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - (ϵ_k - μ) + iδ)\n\n    G0_expression = 1 / (omega - (epsilon_k - mu) + i * delta)\n\n    # Create a symbolic representation of the full equation for printing\n    G0_symbol = sympy.Function('G₀')(k, omega)\n    equation = sympy.Eq(G0_symbol, G0_expression)\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function (G₀) for a non-interacting particle\")\n    print(\"has a direct and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe relationship is expressed in the frequency-momentum (or energy-momentum) domain as follows:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Pretty print the equation.
