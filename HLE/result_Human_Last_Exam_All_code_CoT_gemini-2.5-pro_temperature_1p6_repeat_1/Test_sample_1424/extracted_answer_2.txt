In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ (shifted by the chemical potential $\mu$). The explicit formula for the retarded Green's function is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - (\epsilon_k - \mu) + i\delta}$.
