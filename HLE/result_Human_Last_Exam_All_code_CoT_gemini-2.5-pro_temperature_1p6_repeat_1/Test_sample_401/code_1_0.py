    This function explains and provides the answer to a question in point-set topology.
    
    Question: What is the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have?
    
    Definitions:
    - Continuum: A compact, connected, non-empty Hausdorff space.
    - Indecomposable Continuum: A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.
    - Composant: For a point p in an indecomposable continuum X, its composant is the set of all points q in X
      for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both p and q.

    Theorem:
    A fundamental theorem concerning indecomposable continua states that any such continuum X is partitioned by its
    composants. Furthermore, the number of distinct composants in X is always 'c', which is the cardinality
    of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).

    Conclusion:
    Since every indecomposable continuum has exactly 'c' composants, the smallest possible number of
    composants is also 'c'.
