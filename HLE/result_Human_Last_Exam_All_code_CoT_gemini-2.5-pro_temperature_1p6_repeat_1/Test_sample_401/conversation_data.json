    "This is a question from the field of point-set topology. The answer is derived directly from a mathematical theorem rather than a computational algorithm. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the key terms**: First, I will clarify what an \"indecomposable continuum\" and a \"composant\" are in a topological context.\n2.  **State the relevant theorem**: I will state the fundamental theorem that describes the number of composants in any indecomposable continuum. This theorem directly answers the question.\n3.  **Formulate the answer**: The theorem shows that the number of composants is fixed for any such continuum. Therefore, the \"smallest number\" is this fixed value.\n4.  **Generate Python code**: The Python code will print a clear explanation of this theorem and the final answer, fulfilling the request to provide a coded solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the answer to a question in point-set topology.\n    \n    Question: What is the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have?\n    \n    Definitions:\n    - Continuum: A compact, connected, non-empty Hausdorff space.\n    - Indecomposable Continuum: A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    - Composant: For a point p in an indecomposable continuum X, its composant is the set of all points q in X\n      for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both p and q.\n\n    Theorem:\n    A fundamental theorem concerning indecomposable continua states that any such continuum X is partitioned by its\n    composants. Furthermore, the number of distinct composants in X is always 'c', which is the cardinality\n    of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).\n\n    Conclusion:\n    Since every indecomposable continuum has exactly 'c' composants, the smallest possible number of\n    composants is also 'c'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The cardinality of the continuum, 'c', is a transfinite number, not a standard integer.\n    # It is equal to 2 to the power of ℵ₀ (aleph-null), the cardinality of the natural numbers.\n    cardinality_symbol = \"c\"\n    cardinality_value_expression = \"2^ℵ₀\"\n\n    print(\"This is a question from point-set topology.
