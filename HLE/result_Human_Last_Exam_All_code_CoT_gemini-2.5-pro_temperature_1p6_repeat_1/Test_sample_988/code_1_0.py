    When Microcystis aeruginosa is exposed to high temperatures (like 29°C), it experiences oxidative stress due to an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The cell's first and most immediate line of defense is the activation of its enzymatic antioxidant system.

    Enzymes such as Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) are constitutively present and can be rapidly activated to neutralize the burst of ROS. This enzymatic response is faster than synthesizing new non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules or altering pigment concentrations. Studies on M. aeruginosa CAAT 2005-3 specifically show a significant and initial increase in the activity of these enzymes under heat stress.
