# Given parameters for the X_0(t) equation
A = 10**10
B = 1/100000 - 1

# The ODE for X_0(t) is X'_0(t) + (B+1)X_0(t) = A.
# The boundary condition X_0(0) = X_0(T) forces the integration constant to be zero.
# This leads to the constant solution X_0(t) = A / (B+1).

# Calculate B + 1
B_plus_1 = B + 1

# Calculate the constant value of X_0(t)
X0_value = A / B_plus_1

# The question is to find X_0(10^20). Since X_0(t) is a constant, this is the value.
result = X0_value

# Output the equation and the values used for the calculation.
# Note: B is a float, so we represent it as a float in the printout.
