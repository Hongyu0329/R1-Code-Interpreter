# Step 1: Define constants and given values
# Use standard SI units for calculation
G = 6.6743e-11  # Gravitational constant in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
c = 2.998e8     # Speed of light in m/s

# Pandora's orbital data
a = 100_000_000 * 1000  # Average orbital radius in meters (100,000,000 km)
T = 800 * 24 * 3600     # Orbital period in seconds (800 Earth days)

# Pioneer's distance from the event horizon
d = 13 * 1000           # Distance in meters (13 km)

# Step 2: Calculate the mass of the black hole Pegasi using Kepler's Third Law
# T^2 / a^3 = (4 * pi^2) / (G * M) => M = (4 * pi^2 * a^3) / (G * T^2)
M = (4 * math.pi**2 * a**3) / (G * T**2)

# Step 3: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of Pegasi
# Rs = 2 * G * M / c^2
Rs = (2 * G * M) / c**2

# Step 4: Calculate the time dilation factor 'f' using the approximation
# The exact formula is f = sqrt(d / (Rs + d)).
# This is equivalent to f = sqrt(1 - Rs / (Rs + d)).
# Since d >> Rs, we can approximate sqrt(1-x) ≈ 1 - x/2.
# So, f ≈ 1 - (Rs / (2 * (Rs + d)))
f_calculated = 1 - (Rs / (2 * (Rs + d)))

# Round f to 3 decimal places as required
f_rounded = round(f_calculated, 3)

# Step 5: Calculate the memory usage 'z' for the most efficient program
# The C program would store Rs as a constant and f as a variable.
# frac { signed char n (6b), unsigned wchar d (12b), signed char e (6b) }
# Size of one 'frac' variable in bits:
bits_per_frac = 6 + 12 + 6  # 24 bits
# Size of one 'frac' variable in trits (1 trit = 3 bits):
trits_per_frac = bits_per_frac / 3
# The most efficient program needs 2 variables: one for Rs, one for f.
num_variables = 2
z = num_variables * trits_per_frac

# Step 6: Print the results including the equation with numerical values
