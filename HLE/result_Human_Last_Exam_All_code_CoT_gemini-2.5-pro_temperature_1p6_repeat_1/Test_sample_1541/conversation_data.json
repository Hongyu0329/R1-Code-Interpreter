    "Of course, I can help you with this problem. Here is my plan, the corresponding Python code, and the analysis for the specific C program question.\n\n### Plan\nFirst, I will provide a Python script to solve the problem of sorting the numbers in the sum.\n\n1.  **Read the input**: The sum is given as a single string, for example, `3+2+1`. I'll read this string from the standard input.\n2.  **Extract the numbers**: The numbers are single digits separated by `+` signs. I will iterate through the input string and collect all the characters that are digits into a list.\n3.  **Sort the numbers**: The list of digits (which are represented as characters) can be sorted alphabetically, which is the same as sorting them numerically in this case.\n4.  **Print the result**: I will join the sorted list of digits back together with `+` signs in between and print the resulting string.\n\nNext, I will address the specific task of analyzing the memory usage for an optimal C program to solve the same problem.\n\n1.  **Optimal C Algorithm**: The most memory-efficient C program would not store the entire input string. Instead, it would read the input character by character and use an array to count the occurrences of each number ('1', '2', '3', '4'). This is a counting sort approach. After counting, it would iterate from 1 to 4 and print each number the required number of times, separated by `+`.\n2.  **Memory Calculation**: I will identify all variables needed for this C program and choose the smallest possible standard data types for them based on the problem's constraints (e.g., the maximum number of terms is around 500). Finally, I'll sum the sizes of these variables to find the total memory usage `m` in bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum as a string, sorts the numbers, and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input string, e.g., \"3+2+1\"\n    s = input()\n\n    # Extract all the numbers from the string.\n    # The numbers are the characters that are not '+'\n    numbers = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char != '+':\n            numbers.append(char)\n\n    # Sort the list of numbers. Since they are single digits,\n    # sorting them as strings works correctly.\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted numbers with '+' and print the result.\n    # The problem asks to print the full equation.\n    output = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        output += numbers[i]\n        if i < len(numbers) - 1:\n            output += \"+\"\n    print(output)\n\nsolve()\n```\n### C Program Memory Analysis\n\nFor the second part of your task, let's analyze the most memory-efficient C program.\n\nThe optimal C program uses a counting sort approach. It reads the input one character at a time and counts the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'. It does not need to store the input string. The variables required and their most memory-efficient types would be:\n\n*   **Counters for numbers**: The input string is at most 1000 characters long, so there can be a maximum of 500 numbers (e.g., in a string like \"1+1+1...\"). A single `char` (1 byte, max value 127 or 255) is not enough to store a count of 500. A `short int` (2 bytes) is sufficient. We need four such counters.\n    *   `short int counts[4];` -> Memory: `4 * 2 = 8 bytes`.\n*   **Character from input**: To read from standard input, `getchar()` is used, which returns an `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` value.\n    *   `int c;` -> Memory: `4 bytes`.\n*   **Loop counters and flags**:\n    *   A flag to manage printing the `+` character correctly can be a `char`. Memory: `1 byte`.\n    *   The outer loop iterates through the numbers 1-4. A `char` is sufficient. Memory: `1 byte`.\n    *   The inner loop iterates up to the count of each number (max 500). A `short int` is needed. Memory: `2 bytes`.\n\nSumming the memory usage for all these variables gives us the total `m`:\n\n`m` = (memory for counts) + (memory for input char) + (memory for flag) + (memory for outer loop var) + (memory for inner loop var)\n`m = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 16` bytes.\n\n<<<16>>>"
