    1.  Deconstruct the Poem:
        -   'Each oval frame contains an inventory of eyes and dust': This sets a scene of old, displayed specimens that are decaying. 'Inventory' suggests a scientific or systematic collection.
        -   'caught behind silvered dislocation': The moths are trapped behind glass. 'Silvered' evokes the tarnishing of an old mirror or frame, and 'dislocation' means they are removed from their natural context.
        -   'that strange tarnished logic of their discipline': This line is a comment on the state of the moths. The poem defines their state ('silvered dislocation') AS this 'logic'.

    2.  Analyze the key phrase 'strange tarnished logic of their discipline':
        -   'Discipline': This can refer to the collector's scientific discipline or the moths' instinctual discipline.
        -   'Logic': The system or reasoning behind the discipline.
        -   'Tarnished': This is the crucial word. It means corroded or degraded. It connects strongly with the physical decay implied by 'dust' and 'silvered'.

    3.  Evaluate the options:
        -   The 'discipline' in question is the scientific practice of preserving specimens. The 'logic' of this discipline is to achieve permanence.
        -   This logic is 'tarnished' because the very attempt to preserve the moths has led to their decay into 'dust' within the frame. The goal of permanence has been corrupted by time.
        -   Therefore, the line is a commentary on how the process of scientific preservation is flawed and ironically leads to degradation over time.

    4.  Conclusion:
        -   Choice (B) perfectly encapsulates this interpretation. The poem points out that the 'discipline' of specimen preservation has a 'tarnished logic,' as it results in degradation.
