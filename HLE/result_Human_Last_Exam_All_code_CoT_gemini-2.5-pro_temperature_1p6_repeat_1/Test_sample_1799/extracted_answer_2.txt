No, the 2nd postulate of special relativity is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first. The first postulate (the principle of relativity) alone allows for multiple possible theories of space-time, including Galilean relativity (with an infinite invariant speed). The 2nd postulate is an essential, independent assertion, based on experimental evidence from electromagnetism, which states that the universal invariant speed is finite and is the speed of light, c. This selects the correct physical theory from the possibilities allowed by the first postulate.
