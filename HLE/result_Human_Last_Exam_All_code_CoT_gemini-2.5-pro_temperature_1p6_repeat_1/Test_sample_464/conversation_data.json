    "Yes, it does follow that $f=0$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\nThe proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform on the Schwartz space.\n\n1.  **Fourier Transform and its Derivatives:**\n    Let $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of the function $f(x)$, defined as $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$. A key property of the Fourier transform relates the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin to the moments of the original function $f(x)$:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) \\bigg|_{\\xi=0} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\cdot 0} dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx $$\n\n2.  **Applying the Given Condition:**\n    The problem states that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. Substituting this into the identity above, we find that all derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin are zero:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\n\n3.  **Analyticity of the Fourier Transform:**\n    Since $f(x)$ is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is also a Schwartz function. This implies that $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is not only infinitely differentiable but also analytic on the entire real line. This means that $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is equal to its Taylor series expansion around any point.\n\n4.  **Taylor Series Expansion:**\n    The Taylor series for $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around the origin $\\xi = 0$ is given by:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k $$\n    Since we have shown that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$, the Taylor series is identically zero:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{0}{k!} \\xi^k = 0 $$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Because $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is analytic and its Taylor series is zero, the function itself must be zero everywhere: $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The Fourier transform is an invertible map on the space of Schwartz functions, meaning if the transform is the zero function, the original function must also have been the zero function. Therefore, $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n\n### Code Example\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to demonstrate the core identity used in the proof for the example function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$. It computes both the moments of $f(x)$ and the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin, showing that the identity holds. This illustrates that if all moments were zero, all derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin would also be zero, leading to the conclusion $f=0$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import exp, pi, oo, I, sqrt\n\ndef demonstrate_moment_transform_identity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the identity relating moments of a function to the\n    derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set up symbolic variables for the function and its transform\n    x, k_var = sympy.symbols('x k_var')\n\n    # Define a non-zero Schwartz function, f(x) = exp(-x^2)\n    f = exp(-x**2)\n    print(f\"Analyzing the function f(x) = {f}\\n\")\n\n    # The Fourier Transform F(k) = integral(f*exp(-2*pi*i*x*k) dx)\n    # For f(x)=exp(-x^2), its FT is sqrt(pi)*exp(-pi^2*k^2)\n    f_hat = sympy.fourier_transform(f, x, k_var)\n    print(f\"Its Fourier Transform is F(k) = {f_hat}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Verifying the identity: F^(n)(0) = (-2*pi*i)^n * Moment_n(f)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Check for the first few non-negative integers n\n    for n in range(6):\n        # 1.
