# This script determines the final barium salt after a series of chemical reactions.

print("Let's analyze the chemical process step by step to identify the final barium salt.")

# Step 1: Mixing initial reactants
print("\n--- Step 1: Mixing Barium Chloride and Silver Nitrate ---")
print("Initial reactants: Barium Chloride (BaCl2) and Silver Nitrate (AgNO3) in water.")
print("A double displacement reaction occurs, producing Barium Nitrate and Silver Chloride.")
print("The chemical equation is: BaCl2(aq) + 2AgNO3(aq) -> Ba(NO3)2(aq) + 2AgCl(s)")
print("At this stage, the barium is in the form of Barium Nitrate (Ba(NO3)2), which is soluble in water, while Silver Chloride (AgCl) is a solid precipitate.")

# Step 2: First drying process
print("\n--- Step 2: First Freeze Drying ---")
print("The water is removed from the flask via freeze drying.")
print("This leaves a mixture of two solid salts: solid Barium Nitrate and solid Silver Chloride.")
print("The barium salt is still Barium Nitrate.")

# Step 3: Addition of Ammonia
print("\n--- Step 3: Addition of Ammonia ---")
print("Ammonia (NH3) is added. Silver Chloride reacts with ammonia to form a soluble complex: AgCl(s) + 2NH3(aq) -> [Ag(NH3)2]Cl(aq).")
print("Barium Nitrate does not react with ammonia and simply dissolves in the aqueous ammonia solution.")
print("The barium salt remains Barium Nitrate, now in a dissolved state again.")

# Step 4: Second drying process
print("\n--- Step 4: Second Freeze Drying ---")
print("The ammonia and water are removed by a second freeze-drying step.")
print("Removing ammonia causes the soluble silver complex to decompose, reforming the solid Silver Chloride (AgCl) precipitate.")
print("Removing water causes the dissolved Barium Nitrate to crystallize back into its solid form.")

# Step 5: Final Conclusion
print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
print("The flask's final contents are a solid mixture of Silver Chloride and Barium Nitrate.")
print("Therefore, the barium salt present in the flask after all reactions is Barium Nitrate.")
print("\nThe chemical formula for Barium Nitrate is constructed as follows, showing each number explicitly:")
