    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), we need to review the common laboratory and industrial production methods.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Synthesis Methods:** The primary method for producing XeF₄ is the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) gas and fluorine (F₂) gas.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction Conditions:** The outcome of this reaction is highly dependent on temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    `Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)`\n3.  **Evaluate Temperature Effects:**\n    *   At temperatures that are too low, the reaction rate is very slow, making the process inefficient.\n    *   At very high temperatures (e.g., above 400°C), the reaction can start to favor the formation of xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), especially with an excess of fluorine.\n    *   The literature widely reports that heating a xenon-fluorine mixture (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio) at **400°C** provides the best yield for XeF₄, making it the standard temperature for efficient synthesis. While other specialized low-temperature methods exist (e.g., using O₂F₂ or photochemical activation), the direct thermal synthesis at 400°C is the most common and efficient method referred to in this context.\n4.  **Select the Best Answer:** Comparing this information with the given choices, 400°C is the lowest temperature listed that allows for an efficient and high-yield reaction.\n\nThe following Python code will print the chemical equation for the synthesis and the optimal temperature from the choices.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes known synthesis methods for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    and identifies the optimal temperature for efficient production from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known synthesis conditions for XeF4.
