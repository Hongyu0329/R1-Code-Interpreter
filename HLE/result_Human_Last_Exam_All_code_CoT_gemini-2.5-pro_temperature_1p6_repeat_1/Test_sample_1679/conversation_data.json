    "My plan is to identify the first Academy Award Best Picture winner that depicts one of the two Luxor Obelisks. One obelisk is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other is in the Place de la Concorde, Paris. I will check major Best Picture winners known for their settings in Paris or Egypt in chronological order.\n\n1.  **List Candidates**: I will list potential winners set in Paris or Egypt. Key candidates include *Casablanca* (1943), *An American in Paris* (1951), *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), and *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962).\n2.  **Chronological Review**: I'll examine each film chronologically.\n    *   *Casablanca* (won for 1943): Its Paris flashback montage does not feature the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   *An American in Paris* (won for 1951): The film's final ballet sequence clearly depicts the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk in a stylized manner. This is a confirmed sighting.\n    *   Later films like *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) also show the obelisk, but *An American in Paris* came first.\n3.  **Conclusion**: Based on this analysis, *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner to show a Luxor Obelisk.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this process and prints the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# A simple class to encapsulate the logic and findings\nclass ObeliskFinder:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Data: A list of candidate films.\n        # (Award Year, Film Title, Location, Depicts_Obelisk_Reasoning)\n        self.candidate_films = [\n            (1943, \"Casablanca\", \"Paris (flashback)\", \"The famous Paris montage does not contain a clear shot of the Place de la Concorde or the obelisk.\"),\n            (1951, \"An American in Paris\", \"Paris\", \"Yes, the final ballet sequence features a stylized but clear depiction of the Place de la Concorde, with the obelisk.\"),\n            (1956, \"Around the World in 80 Days\", \"Paris\", \"Yes, an aerial shot of the Place de la Concorde and the obelisk is shown.\"),\n            (1958, \"Gigi\", \"Paris\", \"Yes, contains on-location footage of the Place de la Concorde.\"),\n            (1962, \"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"Egypt\", \"No, scenes are set in Cairo, but the film does not depict the Luxor Temple.\"),\n        ]\n        self.answer = None\n\n    def find_first_winner(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Sorts candidates by year and finds the first one with a confirmed obelisk depiction.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Sort candidates chronologically by award year\n        sorted_candidates = sorted(self.candidate_films)\n        \n        for year, title, location, reasoning in sorted_candidates:\n            if \"Yes,\" in reasoning:\n                self.answer = {\"year\": year, \"title\": title, \"reasoning\": reasoning}\n                return\n\n    def print_result(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Prints the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.answer:\n            print(f\"To find the first Best Picture winner depicting a Luxor Obelisk, we analyze key films chronologically.\")\n            print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n            print(f\"1.
