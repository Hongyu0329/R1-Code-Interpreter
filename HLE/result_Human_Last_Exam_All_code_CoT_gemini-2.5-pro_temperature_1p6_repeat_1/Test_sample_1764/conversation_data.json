    "An isometric embedding is a function that preserves distances between two spaces. We are asked for the minimum possible number of such functions from a finite ultrametric space $X$ to a Banach space $B$.\n\nThe number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer. If we can find a specific example of a space $X$ and a space $B$ for which there are no possible isometric embeddings, then the number of embeddings is 0. Since this number cannot be negative, 0 would be the smallest possible number.\n\nI will demonstrate that such a case exists using a Python script. The script will try to construct an embedding for a simple case and show that it is impossible.\n\n**The Plan:**\n1.  Choose a simple finite ultrametric space $X$: three points $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ where the distance between any two distinct points is 1. This is known as a uniform metric space, and it satisfies the strong triangle inequality, making it an ultrametric space.\n2.  Choose a simple Banach space $B$: the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value as the norm.\n3.  An isometric embedding would map the three points of $X$ to three points $p_1, p_2, p_3$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that the absolute difference (distance) between any two points is 1.\n4.  The script will systematically try to find such points and show that no solution exists.\n    *   It places the first point $p_1$ at the origin (we can do this without loss of generality because the distance property is translation-invariant).\n    *   It then finds the possible locations for the second point $p_2$.\n    *   Finally, it shows that there is no location for the third point $p_3$ that satisfies the distance requirements with respect to both $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n5.  This impossibility proves that the number of embeddings for this specific $X$ and $B$ is 0. Therefore, the minimum possible number is 0.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates that it is possible for the number of isometric embeddings\n    from a finite ultrametric space X to a Banach space B to be zero.\n    This implies that the smallest possible number of such embeddings is 0.\n\n    The demonstration uses:\n    X: A 3-point space {x1, x2, x3} with the uniform metric d(xi, xj) = 1 for i != j.\n    B: The Banach space of real numbers R with the standard absolute value norm.\n\n    An isometric embedding requires finding three points p1, p2, p3 in R such that:\n    |p1 - p2| = 1\n    |p1 - p3| = 1\n    |p2 - p3| = 1\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the problem in mathematical terms.\")\n    print(\"We need to find p1, p2, p3 in R satisfying the following equations:\")\n    d_12 = 1\n    d_13 = 1\n    d_23 = 1\n    print(f\"|p1 - p2| = {d_12}\")\n    print(f\"|p1 - p3| = {d_13}\")\n    print(f\"|p2 - p3| = {d_23}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # By translational invariance, we can set p1 to any value.
