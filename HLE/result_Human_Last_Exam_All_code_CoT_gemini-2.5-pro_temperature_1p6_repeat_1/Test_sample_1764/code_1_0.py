    This script demonstrates that it is possible for the number of isometric embeddings
    from a finite ultrametric space X to a Banach space B to be zero.
    This implies that the smallest possible number of such embeddings is 0.

    The demonstration uses:
    X: A 3-point space {x1, x2, x3} with the uniform metric d(xi, xj) = 1 for i != j.
    B: The Banach space of real numbers R with the standard absolute value norm.

    An isometric embedding requires finding three points p1, p2, p3 in R such that:
    |p1 - p2| = 1
    |p1 - p3| = 1
    |p2 - p3| = 1
