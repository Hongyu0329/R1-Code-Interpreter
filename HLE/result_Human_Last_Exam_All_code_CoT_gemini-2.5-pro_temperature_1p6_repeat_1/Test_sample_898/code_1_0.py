    Analyzes a quantum logic problem to determine the correct observable statement.

    The script follows these steps:
    1.  Defines the propositions based on the problem description.
    2.  Identifies the crucial relationship between propositions 'b' and 'c'.
    3.  Explains the status of the distributive law in quantum logic.
    4.  Shows how the special relationship between 'b' and 'c' makes the distributive law hold true in this specific case (an instance of the modular law).
    5.  Evaluates the given options to find the one that mathematically represents this true logical identity.
