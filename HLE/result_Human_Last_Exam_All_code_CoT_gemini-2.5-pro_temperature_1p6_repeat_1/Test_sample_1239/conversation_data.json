    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ possess a rich symmetry structure. The full Lie group of symmetries is actually infinite-dimensional, primarily due to the freedom in the pressure term (specifically, $p(t, \\mathbf{x}) \\to p(t, \\mathbf{x}) + f(t)$ for an arbitrary function $f(t)$ is a symmetry). However, the standard question of \"the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\" refers to the maximal *finite-dimensional* Lie group of point symmetries.\n\nMy plan is to identify the generators of this finite-dimensional Lie group, count them, and sum the counts to find the total dimension. These symmetries correspond to physical principles:\n\n1.  **Time translation:** The laws of physics don't change over time.\n2.  **Space translations:** The laws are the same everywhere in space.\n3.  **Spatial rotations:** The laws are isotropic (the same in all directions).\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** The laws are the same for observers in constant relative motion.\n5.  **Scaling:** A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure leaves the equations invariant.\n\nThe following Python code will list these symmetry groups, count the dimension of each, and sum them to find the total dimension of the group.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_lie_group_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the finite-dimensional Lie group\n    of symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The finite-dimensional symmetries and their respective dimensions (number of generators).\n    # This is a classical result from the symmetry analysis of differential equations.\n    symmetries = {\n        \"Time translation\": 1,\n        \"Space translations\": 3,\n        \"Spatial rotations\": 3,\n        \"Galilean boosts\": 3,\n        \"Scaling (dilations)\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries for the\")\n    print(\"3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is the sum of the dimensions\")\n    print(\"of its component symmetry groups:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"Dimension from {name}: {dim}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Build and print the final equation\n    dimensions = list(symmetries.values())\n    total_dimension = sum(dimensions)\n    \n    equation_parts = [str(d) for d in dimensions]\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"The total dimension is calculated by the sum:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_dimension}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_lie_group_dimension()\n    # The final answer is 11.\n    # We add this special format for the final answer as requested.\n    # To avoid printing the marker to stdout, we write to stderr.\n    sys.stderr.write(\"<<<11>>>\")\n```"
