# The total number of boxes

# The optimal strategy is to open n-1 (19) boxes.
# Let C be the box that remains closed.
# The guess for the number in C is the interval [0, max(opened_numbers)].

# There are two cases for the number x_C in the closed box, based on its rank
# among all n numbers.

# Case 1: The number x_C is the maximum of all n numbers.
# The probability of this case is 1/n, since any number has an equal chance
# of being in the closed box.
prob_is_max = 1 / n

# In this case, the guess interval is [0, max(opened_numbers)].
# max(opened_numbers) will be the second-largest number of all n numbers.
# Since x_C is the largest, it will be outside the interval.
# So, the probability of winning in this case is 0.
p_win_if_max = 0

# Case 2: The number x_C is NOT the maximum of all n numbers.
# This happens with probability (n-1)/n.
prob_is_not_max = (n - 1) / n

# In this case, one of the opened boxes must contain the maximum number.
# So, max(opened_numbers) is the true maximum of all n numbers.
# The guessed interval is [0, true_maximum].
# Any non-maximum number must fall into this interval.
# So, the probability of winning in this case is 1.
p_win_if_not_max = 1

# The total probability of success is the sum of probabilities of all cases.
total_p = (prob_is_not_max * p_win_if_not_max) + (prob_is_max * p_win_if_max)

# Printing the final equation and the result.
# The numbers in the equation are: the number of winning scenarios (n-1),
# the total number of scenarios (n), and the final probability.
