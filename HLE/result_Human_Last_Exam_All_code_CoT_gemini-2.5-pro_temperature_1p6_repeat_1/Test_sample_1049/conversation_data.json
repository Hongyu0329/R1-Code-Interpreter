    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the sum:** The sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum is $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}$.\n\n2.  **Use Generating Functions:** The generating function for $S_n$ is the product of the generating functions for $a_k$ and $b_k$.\n    *   Let $C_p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^p \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$.\n    *   The generating function for $b_k$ is $C_0(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   The generating function for $a_k$ is $C_5(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$.\n    *   The generating function for $S_n$ is $S(x) = C_5(x) \\cdot C_0(x)$.\n\n3.  **Find the Generating Function a_k:** We can find a recurrence for $C_p(x)$. Notice that applying the operator $\\mathcal{D} = 2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1$ to a series $\\sum f(k)x^k$ gives $\\sum (2k+1)f(k)x^k$.\n    *   Thus, $C_{p+1}(x) = \\mathcal{D} C_p(x)$.\n    *   We can establish that $C_p(x)$ has the form $P_p(x)(1-4x)^{-(2p+1)/2}$, where $P_p(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$.\n    *   Starting with $P_0(x)=1$, we can derive a recurrence relation for the polynomials: $P_{p+1}(x) = (1+8px)P_p(x) + 2x(1-4x)P'_p(x)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate P_5(x):** We will iterate the recurrence starting from $P_0(x)=1$ to find $P_5(x)$. This involves polynomial arithmetic (addition, multiplication, differentiation).\n\n5.  **Determine S(x):** With $P_5(x)$, we have $C_5(x) = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$.\n    *   $S(x) = C_5(x)C_0(x) = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-11/2} (1-4x)^{-1/2} = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-6}$.\n\n6.  **Extract the coefficient S_n:** We need to find the coefficient of $x^n$ in $S(x)$.\n    *   Let $P_5(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} c_j x^j$.\n    *   $S_n = [x^n] \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{4} c_j x^j \\right) (1-4x)^{-6}$.\n    *   Using the generalized binomial theorem, $[x^m](1-4x)^{-6} = \\binom{m+5}{5}4^m$.\n    *   $S_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} c_j [x^{n-j}] (1-4x)^{-6} = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} c_j \\binom{(n-j)+5}{5} 4^{n-j}$.\n    *   This can be written as $S_n = 4^n \\sum_{j=0}^{4} \\frac{c_j}{4^j} \\binom{n-j+5}{5}$.\n\n7.  **Final Python Code:** A Python script will perform the polynomial recurrence calculation to find the coefficients $c_j$ of $P_5(x)$, compute the final coefficients of the binomial terms, and print the closed-form expression.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P\n\ndef solve_sum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the closed form for the given sum by:\n    1. Establishing a recurrence relation for the polynomials P_p(x) that define the\n       generating functions C_p(x) = sum_{k=0 to inf} (2k+1)^p * C(2k,k) * x^k.\n    2. Calculating P_5(x) by iterating the recurrence.\n    3. Using P_5(x) to determine the generating function for the sum S_n.\n    4. Extracting the coefficient S_n, which results in a formula involving\n       a sum of binomial coefficients.\n    5.
