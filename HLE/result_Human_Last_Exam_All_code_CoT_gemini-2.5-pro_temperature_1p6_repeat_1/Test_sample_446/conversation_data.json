    "To determine which peptide is most likely to bind an integrin receptor in an *in vitro* assay, we need to look beyond the core RGD motif, which is present in all options. The amino acids flanking the RGD sequence are critical for binding affinity and specificity.\n\nMy approach will be to programmatically check the given peptide candidates against a list of well-established, classic integrin-binding sequences that are frequently used in research. The RGDSP sequence, derived from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin, is one of the most well-characterized and commonly used peptides in *in vitro* integrin-binding and cell adhesion assays. My code will simulate this search to identify the most likely candidate.\n\n```python\ndef find_integrin_binding_peptide():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the most likely integrin-binding peptide from a list of candidates\n    by checking against known high-affinity sequences.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of well-known integrin-binding motifs.
