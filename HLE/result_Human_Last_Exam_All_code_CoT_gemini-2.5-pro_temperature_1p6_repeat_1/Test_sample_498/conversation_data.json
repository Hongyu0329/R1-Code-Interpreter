    "This puzzle is based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard. The sequence is composed of two separate sequences that are interleaved.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Separate the main sequence `ZXXCVYBN` into two interleaved sub-sequences.\n2.  The first sub-sequence consists of the letters at odd positions: `Z, X, V, B`. The next letter we need to find is the 5th letter in this sequence.\n3.  The second sub-sequence consists of the letters at even positions: `X, C, Y, N`.\n4.  Analyze the first sub-sequence to find its pattern. The letters `Z, X, V, B` all come from the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard (`Z X C V B N M ...`).\n5.  By examining their positions, we can find the pattern.\n    *   `Z` is the 1st key.\n    *   `X` is the 2nd key.\n    *   `V` is the 4th key.\n    *   `B` is the 5th key.\n6.  The pattern is taking adjacent pairs of keys from the bottom row: first `(Z,X)` (positions 1-2), then skipping a key (`C` at position 3), then taking the next pair `(V,B)` (positions 4-5).\n7.  To find the next letter, we continue the pattern: skip the next key (`N` at position 6), and then take the next key, which is `M` (at position 7).\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this logic and find the next letter.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the letter sequence puzzle by analyzing interleaved patterns\n    on a QWERTY keyboard layout.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard\n    bottom_row = \"ZXCVBNM\"\n\n    # The original sequence provided by the user\n    original_sequence = \"ZXXCVYBN\"\n    \n    # Separate the interleaved sequences\n    seq1 = original_sequence[0::2] # Letters at odd positions: Z, X, V, B\n    seq2 = original_sequence[1::2] # Letters at even positions: X, C, Y, N\n\n    print(\"The puzzle sequence is based on the QWERTY keyboard.\")\n    print(\"It is formed by two interleaved sequences:\")\n    print(f\"Sequence 1 (odd positions): {', '.join(list(seq1))}\")\n    print(f\"Sequence 2 (even positions): {', '.join(list(seq2))}\")\n    print(\"\\nWe need to find the next letter in Sequence 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nAnalyzing Sequence 1 based on the bottom keyboard row: \" + bottom_row)\n\n    # Explain the pattern using positions (1-indexed for clarity)\n    z_pos = bottom_row.find('Z') + 1\n    x_pos = bottom_row.find('X') + 1\n    v_pos = bottom_row.find('V') + 1\n    b_pos = bottom_row.find('B') + 1\n\n    print(f\"\\nPattern Derivation:\")\n    print(f\"Z is at position {z_pos}.\")\n    print(f\"X is at position {x_pos}.
