    "To solve this, I will first establish the sound frequency produced by human muscle twitches. Then, I will gather the known hearing ranges for each animal listed in the options. Finally, I will write a Python script to compare the muscle twitch frequency against each animal's hearing range to determine which ones could theoretically hear the sound. The script will print out each step of this logical comparison, including all the numbers involved, and provide a final conclusion based on the data and relevant scientific findings.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_animal_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal from a given list can hear a human muscle twitch\n    by comparing the sound's frequency to each animal's hearing range.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of the sound source.\n    # Human muscle contractions produce a low-frequency sound (mechanomyogram).\n    target_frequency = 25\n    print(f\"The sound frequency produced by a human muscle twitch is approximately {target_frequency} Hz.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the approximate hearing ranges for each animal choice.\n    # Note: These are general ranges and can vary.\n    animal_hearing_ranges = {\n        \"A.
