    print("--- 1. Invoice Analysis ---")
    print("LC Requirement: 'Invoice'")
    print("Document Presented: 'One original unsigned Invoice'")
    print("Analysis: According to UCP 600 Article 18, a commercial invoice does not need to be signed unless the LC explicitly requires it.")
    print("Conclusion: The LC does not require a signature, so an unsigned invoice is acceptable.")
    print("Result for Statement A: INCORRECT. This is not a discrepancy.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Discrepancy B: Bill of Lading not in full set ---
    print("--- 2. Bill of Lading (B/L) Analysis ---")
    print("Document Presented states: 'No of original Bill of lading: 3'")
    print("Actual documents presented: 'One original Bill of lading'")
    print("Analysis: According to UCP 600 Article 20, if a transport document like a B/L is issued in more than one original, the full set of originals must be presented.")
    print("Conclusion: Presenting only 1 out of 3 originals constitutes a failure to present the full set.")
    print("Result for Statement B: CORRECT. This is a valid discrepancy.\n")
    
    # --- Analysis of Discrepancy C: Bill of Lading not made out as per LC's term ---
    print("--- 3. B/L Consignee Analysis ---")
    print("LC Requirement: 'Bill of lading make out to order of issuing bank'")
    print("Document Presented states: 'Consignee: DEF Company'")
    print("Analysis: The B/L is consigned directly to 'DEF Company', not 'to order of issuing bank'.")
    print("Further Analysis: The B/L is endorsed on the back by the consignee (DEF Company) 'To the order of Bank X'. While this endorsement correctly transfers the title to the bank, the face of the document is not strictly 'made out' as required by the LC.")
    print("Conclusion: A document examiner would cite this as a discrepancy ('B/L not consigned as per L/C terms').")
    print("Result for Statement C: CORRECT. This is a valid discrepancy.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Discrepancy D: Packing List in original vs photocopy ---
    print("--- 4. Packing List Analysis ---")
    print("LC Requirement: 'One photocopy of Packing list'")
    print("Document Presented: 'One original of Packing list'")
    print("Analysis: According to UCP 600 Article 14 (f), if an LC requires a document to be presented as a copy, presentation of either an original or a copy is permitted.")
    print("Conclusion: Presenting an original document instead of a required copy is acceptable.")
    print("Result for Statement D: INCORRECT. This is not a discrepancy.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Discrepancy E: Packing List not signed by Beneficiary ---
    print("--- 5. Packing List Signature Analysis ---")
    print("LC Requirement: The LC does not specify who should sign the Packing List.")
    print("Document Presented: The Packing List is signed by the Shipper (ABC Company), not the Beneficiary (Y Company).")
    print("Analysis: Since the LC is silent on the signing requirement for the packing list, there is no obligation for it to be signed by the beneficiary.")
    print("Conclusion: The signature on the packing list does not create a discrepancy.")
    print("Result for Statement E: INCORRECT. This is not a discrepancy.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion based on the analysis ---
    print("--- Overall Conclusion ---")
    print("Based on the analysis, we have identified two valid discrepancies:")
    print("Discrepancy B: Bill of lading is not presented in full set (1 of 3 presented).")
    print("Discrepancy C: Bill of lading is not made out as per LC's term (consignee is incorrect on the face of the document).")
    print("\nTherefore, the statement 'G. B and C are correct' is the true statement.")
