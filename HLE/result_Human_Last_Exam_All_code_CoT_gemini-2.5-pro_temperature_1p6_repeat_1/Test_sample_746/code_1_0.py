    print("For a connected topological space X, a point x is a dispersion point if X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.")
    print("We want to find the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points for a compact connected metric space X.")
    print("\nLet D be the set of dispersion points of X.")
    
    print("\n--- Part 1: Proving |D| <= 1 ---")
    print("We use a proof by contradiction. Assume |D| >= 2.")
    print("Let p and q be two distinct dispersion points in D.")
    
    print("\nStep 1: Use the metric space properties.")
    print("Since X is a metric space, there is a distance function d. Let d(p, q) = r.")
    print("Since p and q are distinct, r > 0.")
    print("We can define two disjoint open balls around p and q:")
    print("  U = B(p, r/2) = {y in X | d(y, p) < r/2}")
    print("  V = B(q, r/2) = {y in X | d(y, q) < r/2}")
    print("These two sets U and V are disjoint.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Use the dispersion point property.")
    print("Since q is a dispersion point, the space Y = X \\ {q} is totally disconnected.")
    print("The point p is in Y. Since Y is totally disconnected, the only connected subset of Y containing p is {p}.")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Finding a special set A.")
    print("A property of totally disconnected spaces is that for any point (like p) and any neighborhood of it (like U), there is a smaller set A containing p that is both open and closed (clopen) within that neighborhood.")
    print("So, there exists a set A such that:")
    print("  1. p ∈ A ⊂ U")
    print("  2. A is clopen in Y = X \\ {q}.")
    
    print("\nStep 4: The contradiction.")
    print("Since A is open in Y and Y is open in X, A is open in X.")
    print("Now consider the closure of A in X, denoted cl(A).")
    print("If cl(A) = A, then A is a non-empty (contains p) proper (does not contain q) clopen subset of X. This contradicts that X is connected.")
    print("Therefore, the closure of A must include the only point missing from Y, which is q. So, cl(A) = A ∪ {q}.")
    print("This means q is a limit point of A.")
    print("By the definition of a limit point, any neighborhood of q must intersect A. Let's take the neighborhood V = B(q, r/2).")
    print("This means V ∩ A must be non-empty.")
    print("But we know A ⊂ U. This implies V ∩ U must be non-empty.")
    print("This is a CONTRADICTION, because we defined U and V to be disjoint.")
    
    print("\n--- Conclusion of Part 1 ---")
    print("Our assumption that |D| >= 2 leads to a contradiction. Thus, |D| cannot be 2 or more. So, |D| <= 1.")
    
    print("\n--- Part 2: Existence of a space with |D| = 1 ---")
    print("There are known examples of compact connected metric spaces that have exactly one dispersion point.")
    print("A famous example is the Knaster-Kuratowski fan (or Cantor leaky tent).")
    print("This confirms that a cardinality of 1 is possible.")

    print(f"Combining both parts, the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points is {max_cardinality}.")
