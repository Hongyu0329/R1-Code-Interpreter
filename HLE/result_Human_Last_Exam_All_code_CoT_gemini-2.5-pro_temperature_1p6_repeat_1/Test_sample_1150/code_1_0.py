    # Step 5: Infer the Full Place Structure

    print_wrapped("x3: The object/event/time that the day (x1) is ADJACENT to (from lamli).\n")

    # Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
    print_wrapped("Step 6: Now we compare this structure to the answer choices. We are looking for the option that maps 'x2' to the concept of 'future' and 'x3' to the concept of 'adjacent'.")

    print("\nEvaluation:")
    print_wrapped("Although the phrasing in choice I is slightly confusing (e.g., 'x2 refers to something that is in the future' instead of 'x1 is in the future of x2'), it is the only option that correctly associates x2 with the concept of 'future' ('balvi') and x3 with the concept of 'adjacent' ('lamli'). The other options misalign these concepts entirely.")
