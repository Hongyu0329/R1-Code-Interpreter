    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  First, I will break down the Latin line into its component syllables. This process is complex because it requires accounting for elisions, where a final vowel or a vowel followed by 'm' is dropped before a word starting with a vowel.\n    -   `verum ubi` elides to `ver' ubi`.\n    -   `ubi equi` elides to `ub' equi`.\n    -   `equi atque` elides to `equ' atque`.\n2.  An additional complexity in this specific line, a known difficult one from Virgil's Aeneid (11.631), is the treatment of `atque`. It effectively elides its final `-e` to become a single long syllable, which can be represented as `atqu'`. This is a form of poetic license.\n3.  Next, I will determine the metrical quantity of each syllable, classifying it as either long (—) or short (-). A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or diphthong, or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Otherwise, it is short.\n4.  Then, I will group the sequence of long and short syllables into six metrical feet. In hexameter, a foot is either a dactyl (— - -) or a spondee (— —).\n5.  Finally, I will represent each dactyl as \"D\" and each spondee as \"S\" to produce the final six-foot scansion pattern, joined by hyphens.\n\n```python\ndef scan_vergil_aeneid_11_631():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n    This specific line from Virgil's Aeneid is metrically complex and requires\n    careful handling of elisions and poetic conventions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The line is divided into six metrical feet.
