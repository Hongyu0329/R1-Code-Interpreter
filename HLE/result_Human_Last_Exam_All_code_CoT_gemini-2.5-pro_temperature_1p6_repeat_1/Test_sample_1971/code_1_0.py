# Define the symbols. R is the constant scalar curvature, k (kappa) is the gravitational coupling constant.
R = sympy.Symbol('R')
k = sympy.Symbol('κ')

# Step 1: Determine alpha^2 from the supersymmetric AdS vacuum condition.
# The scalar curvature R is related to alpha by R = 3 * k^2 * alpha^2.
# Solving for alpha^2 gives:
alpha_squared = R / (3 * k**2)

# Step 2: Determine beta.
# This is determined by requiring the cancellation of specific terms in the supersymmetry
# variation of the action, which leads to a simple algebraic condition.
beta = -1/2

# Step 3: Print the final results in the required format.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.

# For alpha^2
print("The value of alpha^2 is determined by the equation:")
# We'll print the components of the equation alpha^2 = R / (3 * k^2)
alpha_sq_str = "α²"
eq_parts = str(alpha_squared).split('/')
# This might not split if R=0, but let's assume general R.
