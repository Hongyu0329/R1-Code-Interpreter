    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I will research the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies). My research will focus on established entomological sources to identify their primary and secondary food sources.\n\n1.  **Analyze Primary Diet:** I will investigate if they are predators, herbivores, or detritivores. Initial knowledge suggests they are predatory.\n2.  **Analyze Secondary Diet:** I will check for any records of them feeding on non-prey items, such as plant-based sources like nectar or pollen.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:** I will then compare my findings against each of the provided answer choices (A-G).\n    *   **A. Nectar:** Check if nectar consumption is recorded.\n    *   **B. Māhoe pollen:** Check if pollen consumption is recorded (the specific type, Māhoe, is less important than the general food category).\n    *   **C. Fungus:** Check if fungivory is recorded.\n    *   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Check if herbivory (eating leaf tissue) is recorded.\n    *   **E. Totara Aphids:** Check if predation on aphids is recorded.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the evaluation, I will determine the most comprehensive and accurate answer. Since options F and G are combinations, I will see if multiple individual options are correct.\n\nAfter this analysis, I will construct a Python script that programmatically represents these facts and prints the logical steps to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish known facts about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans based on entomological research.\n    facts = {\n        \"predatory\": True,\n        \"prey\": \"small, soft-bodied insects like aphids and mites\",\n        \"pollen_eater\": True,\n        \"nectar_eater\": True,\n        \"herbivore\": False,  # They do not eat leaf tissue\n        \"fungivore\": False  # They do not eat fungus\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the answer choices provided.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'B': 'Māhoe pollen',\n        'C': 'Fungus',\n        'D': 'Karamū leaf tissue',\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids',\n        'F': 'A and E',\n        'G': 'D and E'\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Evaluate each individual choice against the known facts.\n    print(\"Analyzing the food sources from the choices:\")\n\n    # Evaluation of Choice A: Nectar\n    supported_A = facts[\"nectar_eater\"]\n    print(f\"  - Choice A (Nectar): {'Supported.' if supported_A else 'Not supported.'} Raphidiopterans are known to consume nectar.\")\n\n    # Evaluation of Choice E: Aphids\n    supported_E = facts[\"predatory\"] and \"aphids\" in facts[\"prey\"]\n    print(f\"  - Choice E (Aphids): {'Supported.' if supported_E else 'Not supported.'} Raphidiopterans are well-known predators of aphids.\")\n    \n    # Evaluation of Choice D: Leaf tissue\n    supported_D = facts[\"herbivore\"]\n    print(f\"  - Choice D (Leaf tissue): {'Supported.' if supported_D else 'Not supported.'} Raphidiopterans are not herbivores.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Evaluate the combined choices based on the individual evaluations.\n    print(\"\\nEvaluating combined choices:\")\n    \n    # Choice F combines A and E.\n    supported_F = supported_A and supported_E\n    if supported_F:\n        print(\"  - Choice F combines A and E.
