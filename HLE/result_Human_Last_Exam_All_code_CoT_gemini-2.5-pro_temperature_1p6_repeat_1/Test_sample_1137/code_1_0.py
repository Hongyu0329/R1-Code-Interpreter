    # Step 1: Evaluate Ontario Court of Appeal (A)
    print("Step 1: Analyzing Option A - Ontario Court of Appeal")
    print("   - The Court of Appeal is an appellate court. It hears appeals from lower court decisions.")
    print("   - A new legal action cannot be started here.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Option A is not a valid starting point for litigation.\n")

    # Step 2: Evaluate Federal Court of Canada (E)
    print("Step 2: Analyzing Option E - Federal Court of Canada")
    print("   - The Federal Court's jurisdiction is limited to specific federal laws (e.g., intellectual property, maritime law, cases against the federal government).")
    print(f"   - This dispute involves contracts and business arrangements governed by {jurisdiction}.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Option E does not have jurisdiction over this matter.\n")

    # Step 3: Evaluate Small Claims Court (D)
    print("Step 3: Analyzing Option D - Small Claims Court")
    print("   - The Small Claims Court handles disputes up to a specific monetary limit (e.g., $35,000 in Ontario).")
    print("   - This case involves six large commercial real estate properties and significant development expenses, so the value is well above this limit.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Option D is not appropriate due to the high value of the claim.\n")
    
    # Step 4: Compare Superior Court of Justice (C) and Commercial List (B)
    print("Step 4: Comparing the remaining options - C (Superior Court of Justice) and B (Commercial List)")
    print("   - Option C, the Superior Court of Justice, is the primary trial court in Ontario with general jurisdiction. It is a viable forum for this case.")
    print("   - Option B, the Commercial List, is a specialized branch of the Superior Court of Justice located in Toronto.")
    print("   - The Commercial List is specifically designed to handle complex commercial cases like this one.")
    print(f"   - A key goal for RE1 is '{desired_outcome}'. The Commercial List uses active case management and relies on judges with commercial expertise to expedite proceedings.")
    print("   - Given the complexity of the issues and the desire for efficiency, the Commercial List is the *best and most specialized* forum available.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Option B is the optimal choice.\n")

    # --- Final Answer ---
    final_answer = "B"
