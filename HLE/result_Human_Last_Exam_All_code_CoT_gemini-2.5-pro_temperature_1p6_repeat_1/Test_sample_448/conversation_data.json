    "The rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon (Rn). Unlike other noble gases which are stable, Radon is a radioactive element that is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust and mantle. Because it has a very short half-life (its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days), it decays quickly and does not accumulate, making its overall abundance extremely low at any given time.\n\nMy plan is to estimate its abundance as a percentage of the total Earth's mass. This can be calculated based on the estimated total mass of Radon present on Earth (primarily in the crust, in equilibrium with its parent elements) and the total mass of the Earth.\n\n1.  **Identify the rarest noble gas:** Radon (Rn).\n2.  **Find the estimated total mass of Radon on Earth:** Based on its equilibrium concentration with Uranium in the Earth's crust, the total mass is estimated to be around 1.3 x 10^5 kg.\n3.  **Find the total mass of the Earth:** A standard value, approximately 5.972 x 10^24 kg.\n4.  **Calculate the percentage:** (Mass of Radon / Mass of Earth) * 100.\n5.  **Write the Python code:** The code will define these values and perform the calculation, printing out each number and the final result.\n\n```python\n# The rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon (Rn).\n# This script calculates its estimated abundance as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n# Step 1: Define the known and estimated values.\n# The year 2002 does not change these fundamental physical quantities.\ngas_name = \"Radon (Rn)\"\n# Estimated total mass of Radon in the Earth's crust in kilograms.\n# This is derived from the equilibrium concentration with its parent element, Uranium.\nmass_radon_kg = 1.3e5\n# Total mass of the Earth in kilograms.\nmass_earth_kg = 5.972e24\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the percentage.\n# Percentage = (part / whole) * 100\npercentage = (mass_radon_kg / mass_earth_kg) * 100\n\n# Step 3: Print the result, showing the numbers used in the calculation.\nprint(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {gas_name}.\")\nprint(f\"Its estimated total mass on Earth is approximately {mass_radon_kg:.1e} kg.\")\nprint(f\"The total mass of the Earth is approximately {mass_earth_kg:.3e} kg.\")\nprint(f\"The percentage abundance is calculated as: ({mass_radon_kg} / {mass_earth_kg}) * 100\")\nprint(f\"The percentage of Radon in all terrestrial matter is approximately: {percentage:.20f} %\")\n\n# Final answer variable for direct output\nfinal_answer_value = percentage\n```\n<<<2.176825184192899e-18>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
