# The identified pattern is that the word must have a Consonant-Vowel-Consonant structure
# and must not contain the letters 'm' or 'p'.
# The word 'dam' from the choices contains the letter 'm', so it does not follow the pattern.

# The prompt also asks for a final equation with numbers.
# I will demonstrate that 'dam' does not follow a simple arithmetic pattern
# by converting its letters to their positions in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, etc.)
# and checking if the position of the first letter plus the second equals the third.

word = 'dam'
# Get the 1-based position in the alphabet for each letter
