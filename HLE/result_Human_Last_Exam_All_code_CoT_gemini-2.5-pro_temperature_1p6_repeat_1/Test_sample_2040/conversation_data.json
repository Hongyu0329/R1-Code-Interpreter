    "First, I will answer the user's physics question. Then, since a specific computational task was not provided, I will create and solve a relevant one: calculating the output photon wavelengths in a hypothetical Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) process, based on the principle of energy conservation.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics Question:** The question is whether free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) would exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\n    *   SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A key requirement for a material to exhibit this process is that it must lack a center of inversion symmetry. In technical terms, it must have a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n    *   Materials that are centrosymmetric (possess a center of inversion) have χ⁽²⁾ = 0 and thus cannot exhibit SPDC in their bulk form.\n    *   Most common, stable phases of borophene (like β₁₂ and χ₃) are predicted and observed to be centrosymmetric.\n    *   Therefore, as a general rule, pristine, free-standing boron nanosheets would **not** be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n    *   **Caveat:** This property can change if the symmetry is broken, for example, by applying an external electric field, introducing defects, straining the material, or interacting with a substrate. However, the question specifies \"free-standing,\" which implies the absence of a substrate.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Related Coding Task:** To fulfill the request for a coded solution, I will demonstrate the energy conservation principle in a hypothetical SPDC process. In SPDC, a high-energy \"pump\" photon splits into two lower-energy \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons.\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** E_pump = E_signal + E_idler\n    *   **Energy-Wavelength Relation:** E = hc/λ (where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light)\n    *   **Equation for Wavelengths:** This leads to the relationship: `1 / λ_pump = 1 / λ_signal + 1 / λ_idler`\n\n3.  **Plan the Python Code:**\n    *   I will define a common pump laser wavelength (e.g., 532 nm).\n    *   **Case 1 (Degenerate SPDC):** I will calculate the output wavelength when the pump photon splits into two identical photons (λ_signal = λ_idler). In this case, λ_signal = 2 * λ_pump.\n    *   **Case 2 (Non-Degenerate SPDC):** I will demonstrate a case where the photons have different wavelengths. I'll set a hypothetical signal wavelength and then calculate the corresponding idler wavelength using the formula.\n    *   The code will print the inputs and the full equations with the calculated values, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_spdc_wavelengths(pump_wavelength_nm):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints wavelengths for hypothetical SPDC scenarios.\n\n    Args:\n        pump_wavelength_nm (float): The wavelength of the pump photon in nanometers.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Assuming SPDC in a hypothetical material ---\")\n    print(f\"Pump Wavelength (λ_pump): {pump_wavelength_nm} nm\\n\")\n    print(\"The governing principle is energy conservation, which for wavelengths is:\")\n    print(\"1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler\\n\")\n\n    # --- Case 1: Degenerate SPDC ---\n    # The pump photon splits into two identical photons.\n    # 1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_signal = 2/λ_signal\n    # So, λ_signal = 2 * λ_pump\n    degenerate_output_wavelength_nm = 2 * pump_wavelength_nm\n    print(\"--- Case 1: Degenerate SPDC (photons are identical) ---\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: λ_signal = λ_idler = 2 * λ_pump\")\n    # Print the equation with numbers\n    print(f\"Result: {degenerate_output_wavelength_nm:.2f} nm = 2 * {pump_wavelength_nm} nm\")\n    # Verify the result with the original formula\n    # Note: 1/pump = 1/(2*pump) + 1/(2*pump) = 2/(2*pump) = 1/pump\n    print(f\"Final Equation: 1 / {pump_wavelength_nm} = 1 / {degenerate_output_wavelength_nm:.2f} + 1 / {degenerate_output_wavelength_nm:.2f}\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Case 2: Non-Degenerate SPDC ---\n    # The pump photon splits into two different photons.
