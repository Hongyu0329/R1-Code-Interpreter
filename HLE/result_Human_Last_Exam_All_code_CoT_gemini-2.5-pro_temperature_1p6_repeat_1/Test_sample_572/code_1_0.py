# This Python script formalizes and prints the equation for the largest rank 'r'
# of an N x N rigid matrix that can be constructed with an FNP algorithm.
# The derivation is explained in the plan above.

# The derived relation for r is of the form:
# r = a*N + b*N / sqrt(log_c(N))
# where a, b, and c are constants.

# From the analysis:
# 'a' is the coefficient of the leading term, which is 1.
# 'b' is the constant factor for the second term. Based on our choice of
# delta=1/4 and field size q=N^2, this is approximately -0.637. We use -0.64.
# 'c' is the base of the logarithm, which is 2.
a = 1
b = -0.64
c = 2

# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
