    print("1. Standard Continuity: A function f is continuous at a point x0 if for any neighborhood V around the image f(x0), its preimage f^-1(V) is a neighborhood of x0. The function is continuous if this holds for all x0 in its domain X.")
    print("2. Nonstandard Analysis (NSA): This framework extends spaces like X to a larger space X* which includes 'nonstandard' points. This allows for a more intuitive handling of limits and continuity.")
    print("3. Infinitesimally Close (a ~ b): Two points are infinitesimally close if they are in the same 'monad'. The monad of a standard point p is the collection of all points in X* (standard or not) that are 'infinitely close' to p.")

The premise x0 ~ x1 only holds if x0 = x1, making the implication trivially true for any function. It does not capture continuity.")

    print("   Analysis: This statement says that for any standard point x0, if a point x1 (which can be nonstandard) is infinitesimally close to x0, then their images f(x0) and f(x1) are also infinitesimally close. This is the exact nonstandard characterization of continuity, as it directly translates the local nature of the standard definition to every point in the domain X.")

    print("\nC. forall x0, x1 in X*: x0 ~ x1 ==> f(x0) ~ f(x1)")
    print("   Analysis: This is a property known as S-continuity or microcontinuity. It's a 'global' property on the entire nonstandard space X*.

    print("   Analysis: This is restricted to standard points. It essentially says if f(x0) = f(x1), then x0 = x1. This is the definition of an injective (one-to-one) function, not a continuous one.")

    print("   Analysis: This is a stronger condition than continuity. For example, a constant function f(x) = c is continuous. The premise f(x0) ~ f(x1) would always be true, but the conclusion x0 ~ x1 is generally false. So, this is not equivalent to continuity.")

    print("   Analysis: This is the converse of C and is a condition related to uniform continuity, not just continuity. There are many continuous functions that are not uniformly continuous and would fail this test.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Both B and C are technically equivalent to continuity for standard functions. However, the definition of continuity in standard topology is local (defined at each standard point). Option B directly mirrors this local definition by quantifying over standard points x0 and considering their infinitesimal neighborhoods (monads). Therefore, it is the most fundamental and direct characterization.")
