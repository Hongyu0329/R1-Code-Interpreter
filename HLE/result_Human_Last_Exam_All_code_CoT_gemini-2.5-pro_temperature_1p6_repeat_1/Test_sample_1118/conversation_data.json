    "In this task, I will first identify the specific self-portrait Curt Querner painted in 1933. I will then determine the object he is holding in that portrait and its symbolic significance in the context of his escape from the Gestapo. Finally, I will write a Python script to print the answer, incorporating the relevant year as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the object held by Curt Querner\n    in his 1933 self-portrait as a symbol of resistance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The painting in question is the \"Self-Portrait with Thistle\" from 1933.\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    object_held = \"a thistle\"\n    symbolism = \"a symbol of resistance and prickly defiance\"\n\n    # The prompt requests to output numbers from an equation.\n    # Since there is no equation, I will instead print the significant year.\n    print(f\"In his self-portrait from the year {year}, painted after escaping the Gestapo, {artist} holds {object_held}.\")\n    print(f\"The thistle serves as {symbolism}.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a thistle>>>"
