    "A category with one object is mathematically equivalent to a structure called a **monoid**. A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element.\n\nIn this case, the problem is to find the number of different categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism. This translates to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nLet the three morphisms be `{id, a, b}`, where `id` is the identity morphism. The composition of any two of these morphisms must result in one of the three morphisms in the set. The composition must also be associative (`(f.g).h = f.(g.h)`) and have `id` as the identity (`f.id = id.f = f`).\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to solve this systematically:\n1.  Represent the morphisms numerically: `id=0`, `a=1`, `b=2`.\n2.  The composition table is defined by the four products of the non-identity elements: `a.a`, `a.b`, `b.a`, and `b.b`. Each of these products can be `id`, `a`, or `b`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible structures.\n3.  The script will iterate through all 81 possibilities.\n4.  For each possibility, it will check if the associativity law holds for all combinations of morphisms. This will filter the list down to all valid monoids of order 3.\n5.  Finally, it will group these valid monoids into isomorphism classes. Two monoids are considered isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by swapping the labels of `a` and `b`.\n6.  The script will count the number of unique classes and print the composition rules for a representative of each class.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_isomorphism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object\n    and three morphisms.
