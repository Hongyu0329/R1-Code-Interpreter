    Calculates the number of regular rigid indecomposable modules for a
    complex path algebra of type A_tilde_{2,3}.
    
    This type corresponds to a canonical algebra C(2,3), which has two
    non-homogeneous tubes in its Auslander-Reiten quiver. The ranks of these
    tubes are 2 and 3.

    A regular indecomposable module is rigid if and only if it is a quasi-simple
    module (i.e., at the mouth) of a non-homogeneous tube. The number of such
    modules in a tube of rank 'r' is 'r'.

    Thus, the total number of regular rigid indecomposable modules is the sum
    of the ranks of the non-homogeneous tubes.
