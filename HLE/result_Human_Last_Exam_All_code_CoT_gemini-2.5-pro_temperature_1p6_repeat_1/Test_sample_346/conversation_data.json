    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression:**\n    The first step is to parse the complex expression and identify its components.\n    The expression is: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\n    Let's identify the known combinators for Church numerals and operations:\n    *   `I` is the Church numeral for **1**.\n    *   `S(I)(I)` reduces to `λf.λx. f(f x)`, which is the Church numeral for **2**.\n    *   `S(S(K(S))(K))` is a standard combinator for the **Successor** function (`SUCC`). It takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`.\n\n    Now we can simplify parts of the expression:\n    *   The last part is `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`. This is `SUCC(TWO)`, which equals the Church numeral for **3** (`THREE`).\n    *   The part inside `K` is `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`. This is `SUCC(I)` or `SUCC(ONE)`, which equals the Church numeral for **2** (`TWO`).\n\n    Substituting these back, the expression simplifies to:\n    `S(I) (S(I) (S(I) (K(TWO))) ) (THREE)`\n\n2.  **Apply the Key Reduction Rule:**\n    The expression is dominated by the `S(I)` term. Let's find its reduction rule.\n    The `S` combinator rule is: `S x y z = x z (y z)`.\n    If we set `x = I`, we get: `S I y z = I z (y z)`.\n    Since `I z = z`, the rule simplifies to: `S I y z = z (y z)`.\n\n    This means `S(I)` is an operator that takes two arguments, `y` and `z`, and yields `z(y z)`.\n\n3.  **Reduce the Simplified Expression:**\n    Our expression has the form `S(I) (A) (B)` where:\n    *   `A = S(I)(S(I)(K(TWO)))`\n    *   `B = THREE`\n\n    Applying our rule `S I y z = z (y z)`, the whole expression reduces to `THREE (A THREE)`. Let's evaluate `A THREE`:\n    *   `A THREE = S(I)(S(I)(K(TWO))) (THREE)`\n    *   This again has the form `S I y z`, where `y = S(I)(K(TWO))` and `z = THREE`.\n    *   It reduces to: `THREE ( (S(I)(K(TWO))) THREE )`\n\n    Now we evaluate the innermost part `(S(I)(K(TWO))) THREE`:\n    *   This has the form `S I y z` where `y = K(TWO)` and `z = THREE`.\n    *   It reduces to: `THREE ( (K(TWO)) THREE )`\n    *   The `K` combinator rule is `K x y = x`. So `(K(TWO)) THREE` reduces to `TWO`.\n    *   Thus, the innermost part simplifies to `THREE(TWO)`.\n\n    Now, substitute everything back:\n    *   `A THREE` becomes `THREE(THREE(TWO))`.\n    *   The original expression `THREE(A THREE)` becomes `THREE(THREE(THREE(TWO)))`.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Result as a Numerical Calculation:**\n    In Church encoding, applying a numeral `m` to a numeral `n`, written as `m(n)`, corresponds to exponentiation: `n^m`.\n    *   `THREE(TWO)` means `2^3 = 8`.\n    *   `THREE(THREE(TWO))` means `THREE(8)`, which is `8^3 = 512`.\n    *   `THREE(THREE(THREE(TWO)))` means `THREE(512)`, which is `512^3`.\n\n    So, the Church integer `n` is `512^3`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    We need to find `log_2(n)`.\n    *   `n = 512^3`\n    *   Since `512 = 2^9`, we have `n = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27`.\n    *   Therefore, `log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = 27`.\n\nThis step-by-step reduction reveals the underlying arithmetic, which can be implemented in the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the value of log_2(n) for the given SKI expression.\n# As derived from the logical reduction, the expression n is equivalent to\n# the numerical calculation: ((2^3)^3)^3.\n\n# Let's define the base and exponent from the innermost operation, THREE(TWO) or 2^3.\nbase = 2\nexponent = 3\n\nprint(f\"The SKI expression reduces to a nested exponentiation: (({base}^{exponent})^{exponent})^{exponent}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the innermost value, 2^3\nval1 = base ** exponent\nprint(f\"Innermost operation: {base}^{exponent} = {val1}\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the next level, (result)^3\nval2 = val1 ** exponent\nprint(f\"Middle operation:    {val1}^{exponent} = {val2}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final value of n, (result)^3\nn = val2 ** exponent\nprint(f\"Outermost operation: {val2}^{exponent} = {n}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nprint(f\"The value of the Church integer n is {n}.\")\n\n# Finally, calculate log base 2 of n.\n# log_2(n) = log_2(((2^3)^3)^3) = log_2(2^(3*3*3)) = 3*3*3 = 27.\nfinal_exponent = exponent * exponent * exponent\nfinal_result = math.log2(n)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe final equation is log_2(n) = log_2(({base}^({exponent}*{exponent}*{exponent}))) = log_2({base}^{final_exponent}).\")\nprint(f\"The result of log_2(n) is {final_result}.\")\n\n<<<27.0>>>\n```"
