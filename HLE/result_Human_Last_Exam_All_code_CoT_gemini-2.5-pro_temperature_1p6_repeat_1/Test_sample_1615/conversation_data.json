    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  We start with a fundamental theorem in graph theory concerning the chromatic number. For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n$. The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph, $K_n$.\n2.  In this problem, the graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices and is specified to be not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n3.  Based on the theorem, since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. As the chromatic number must be an integer, the maximum possible value is $n-1$. So, we have an upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n4.  To confirm that $n-1$ is indeed the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists at least one graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of $n-1$.\n5.  We can construct such a graph. Consider a graph $G$ which is a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$), with one additional vertex that is isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n    *   This graph has a total of $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the vertices of the $K_{n-1}$ subgraph.\n    *   The chromatic number of this graph is determined by its largest complete subgraph (clique) that requires the most colors. The $K_{n-1}$ subgraph requires $n-1$ distinct colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of the entire graph $G$ is $\\chi(G) = n-1$.\n6.  Since we have established that $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$ and have found an example where $\\chi(G) = n-1$, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n7.  We can now calculate this value with $n = 12345$. The result is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this calculation and present the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph G with n vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # According to graph theory, the chromatic number of a graph with n vertices, chi(G),\n    # is equal to n if and only if G is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # Since the problem states G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than n.\n    # Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is n - 1.\n    # We can prove this is achievable by constructing a graph, for example, a K_{n-1}\n    # subgraph with one additional isolated vertex.
