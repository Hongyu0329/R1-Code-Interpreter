    "An elegant explanation of the method to solve the problem is presented in the following python block.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the step-by-step derivation of the cardinality of the set of \n    continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nLet S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x). We want to find the cardinality of S, denoted |S|.\n\nStep 1: Preliminary properties of the function f.\n- Injectivity: If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which means exp(x1) = exp(x2). Since the exponential function is injective, this implies x1 = x2. Therefore, f must be an injective function.\n- Monotonicity: A continuous and injective function f: R -> R must be strictly monotonic. This means f is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nStep 2: Analysis of the case where f is strictly decreasing.\nLet's assume f is strictly decreasing.\n1. The domain of f is R. Since f is continuous and strictly decreasing on R, its image, Im(f), must be R. (Specifically, lim_{x->-inf} f(x) = +inf and lim_{x->inf} f(x) = -inf).\n2. The range of the function g(x) = f(f(x)) is given by f(Im(f)).\n3. Since Im(f) = R, the range of f(f(x)) is f(R), which is again Im(f) = R.\n4. The range of the function h(x) = exp(x) is (0, infinity).\n5. The equation f(f(x)) = exp(x) equates the ranges of both sides. This leads to R = (0, infinity), which is a clear contradiction.\n6. Therefore, no strictly decreasing continuous function f: R -> R can satisfy the given equation.\n\nStep 3: Analysis of the case where f is strictly increasing.\nLet's assume f is strictly increasing.\n1. We first prove that f(x) > x for all x in R. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that f(x0) <= x0 for some x0. Since f is strictly increasing, we can apply f to both sides: f(f(x0)) <= f(x0). Combining these gives f(f(x0)) <= f(x0) <= x0. From the given equation, this means exp(x0) <= x0. However, it is a well-known property that exp(x) > x for all real x. This contradiction proves that our initial assumption was false. Thus, f(x) > x for all x in R.\n2. Let I = Im(f). The range of f(f(x)) is f(I), which must be equal to (0, infinity).\n3. Since f is increasing, f applied to the interval I = (inf(I), sup(I)) results in the interval (lim_{y->inf(I)+} f(y), lim_{y->sup(I)-} f(y)). This must equal (0, infinity).\n4. For f continuous on R, this implies that at the boundary points of I (if they are finite), we have f(inf(I)) = 0 and f(sup(I)) = infinity. The latter suggests sup(I) = infinity. So the image of f is of the form I = (x_c, infinity), where f(x_c) = 0.\n5. A strictly increasing function can have at most one root. Let this root be x_c. So, f(x_c) = 0.\n6. For the image of f to be (x_c, infinity), all values f(x) must be greater than x_c. This means f(x_c) > x_c, which implies 0 > x_c. So, the root must be negative.\n7. Also, for the image to be (x_c, infinity), we must have lim_{x->-inf} f(x) = x_c and lim_{x->inf} f(x) = infinity.\n8. A solution f is uniquely determined by a choice of a root x_c in (-infinity, 0), and the choice of a \"seed\" function h that defines f on the interval [x_c, 0]. This seed function h must be a continuous, strictly increasing bijection from [x_c, 0] to [f(x_c), f(0)]. We know f(x_c)=0 and f(f(x_c))=exp(x_c), so f(0)=exp(x_c). Thus, h is a homeomorphism from [x_c, 0] to [0, exp(x_c)]. Any such choice of h can be extended to all of R using the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n\nStep 4: Determining the cardinality.\nThe total number of solutions is the number of ways we can choose x_c and the function h.\n1. The choice for x_c: Any real number from the interval (-infinity, 0) can be chosen. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted as c.\n2. The choice for h: For each fixed x_c, the seed function h is a homeomorphism between two closed intervals. The set of such homeomorphisms is known to have cardinality c.\nThe total number of solutions is the product of these cardinalities: |S| = c * c = c.\n\nConclusion:\nThe cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x) is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_cardinality_problem()\n```\n<<<'The cardinality of the continuum'>>>"
