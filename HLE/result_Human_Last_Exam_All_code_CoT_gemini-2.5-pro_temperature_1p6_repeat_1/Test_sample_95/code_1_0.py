    interpretation3 = "The answer is a plural noun, referring to a collection of objects, like mountains."

    # Conclusion
    conclusion = "The pollution in industrial northern cities would obscure any view of distant mountains. In contrast, the view from Milan is defined by these mountains. The astronomer is a misdirection; the key is geography and atmospheric conditions."
