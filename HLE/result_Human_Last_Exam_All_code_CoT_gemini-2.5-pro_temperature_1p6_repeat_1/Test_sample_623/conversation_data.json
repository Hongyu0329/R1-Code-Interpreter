    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of labeled CO₂ molecules produced, followed by the Python code to execute the logic.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Labeled Carbons:** The starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose, which means the carbon atoms at positions 1 and 4 are the heavier ¹³C isotope.\n2.  **Trace Carbons through Glycolysis:** We will follow the path of the six glucose carbons as glucose is broken down into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. This requires knowledge of the biochemical mapping:\n    *   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form the first pyruvate molecule.\n    *   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose form the second pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The specific arrangement is:\n        *   Glucose C-1 becomes Pyruvate C-3 (the methyl carbon).\n        *   Glucose C-4 becomes Pyruvate C-1 (the carboxyl carbon).\n3.  **Identify the Source of CO₂:** The CO₂ released during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (the step after glycolysis, catalyzed by the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex) comes from the carboxyl carbon (C-1) of pyruvate.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:** By comparing the position of the ¹³C labels on the two pyruvate molecules with the carbon that is released as CO₂, we can count how many labeled CO₂ molecules are produced.\n5.  **Code the Logic:** A Python script will be created to represent this process, printing out each logical step and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glycolysis_co2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the fate of labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis\n    and subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
