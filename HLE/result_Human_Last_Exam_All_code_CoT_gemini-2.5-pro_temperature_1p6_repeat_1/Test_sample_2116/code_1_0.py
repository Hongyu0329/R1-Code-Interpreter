    Calculates the expected maximum earthquake magnitude based on the provided distributions.

    The problem involves:
    1. Yearly maximum magnitude X ~ Pareto(alpha=2, xm=1)
       - CDF: F_X(x) = 1 - 1/x^2
    2. Number of years N ~ LogSeries(p=1/2)
       - PGF: G_N(z) = log(1 - p*z) / log(1 - p)

    The CDF of the overall maximum M = max(X_1, ..., X_N) is F_M(x) = G_N(F_X(x)).
    After substitution and simplification:
    F_M(x) = (log(2*x^2) - log(x^2 + 1)) / log(2)

    The expectation E[M] is the integral of the survival function from 1 to infinity:
    E[M] = Integral from 1 to inf of [1 - F_M(x)] dx
    1 - F_M(x) = log(1 + 1/x^2) / log(2)

    The integral of log(1 + 1/x^2) from 1 to infinity evaluates to (pi/2 - log(2)).
    So, E[M] = (pi/2 - log(2)) / log(2)
             = pi / (2 * log(2)) - 1
