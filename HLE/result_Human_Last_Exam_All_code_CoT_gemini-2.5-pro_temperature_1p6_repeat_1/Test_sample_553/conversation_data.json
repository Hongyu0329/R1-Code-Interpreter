    "This is a music theory question rather than a computational one. I will use my knowledge base to identify the song and then present the answer using a Python script as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the song by The Beatles that features a prominent opening jump from the tonic (I) chord to the minor fifth (v) chord. The most famous example of this is the song \"Help!\".\n2.  In the key of A major, the vocal melody jumps from a C# (part of the A major tonic chord) to a G natural (the minor third of the E minor chord, which is the 'v' chord).\n3.  Create a Python script that stores this information in variables.\n4.  The script will then print a clear statement answering the user's question.\n5.  To fulfill the requirement of outputting an \"equation\", I will also print the chord progression using Roman numeral analysis (I -> v).\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies a Beatles song based on a specific chord progression\n    and prints the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The band in question\n    band = \"The Beatles\"\n\n    # The musical query\n    # The progression is from the tonic chord (I) to the minor fifth chord (v).\n    # For example, in the key of A major, this would be a move from A major to E minor.\n    tonic_chord_roman_numeral = \"I\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_roman_numeral = \"v\"\n\n    # The answer based on music analysis\n    song_title = \"Help!\"\n\n    # Print the final answer\n    print(f\"The song by {band} that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"The progression can be represented in Roman numeral analysis as:\")\n    print(f\"{tonic_chord_roman_numeral} -> {minor_fifth_chord_roman_numeral}\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Help!>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
