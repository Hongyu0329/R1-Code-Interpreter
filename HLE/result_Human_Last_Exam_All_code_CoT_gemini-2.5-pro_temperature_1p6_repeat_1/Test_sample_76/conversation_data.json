    "My plan is to find the number of integer solutions for $x$ to the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$, where $y$ is also an integer.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the range of $x$ values to check. The equation defines a curve, and we are looking for points on this curve with integer coordinates.\n\n1.  **Behavior for large negative x**:\n    Let $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$. If $x$ is a large negative number, the $x^3$ term dominates, making $P(x)$ negative. A negative number cannot be a perfect square. We need to find where $P(x) \\ge 0$. The roots of $P(x)=0$ are approximately -7.42, 6.44, and 16.98. For $P(x)$ to be non-negative, $x$ must be in the integer intervals $[-7, 6]$ or $[17, \\infty)$. So, for negative values, we only need to check $x \\in \\{-7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1\\}$.\n\n2.  **Behavior for large positive x**:\n    For large positive $x$, it is possible to bound the polynomial $P(x)$ between two consecutive squares, which would imply there are no solutions beyond a certain value of $x$. This technique usually works for polynomials of even degree. For our odd degree polynomial, a slight variation is needed. Let's analyze the expression $x \\cdot P(x) = x y^2$.\n    $xP(x) = x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1056x$.\n    Let's compare this to the square of a polynomial in $x$ of degree 2, say $S(x) = x^2-8x-68$.\n    $S(x)^2 = (x^2 - 8x - 68)^2 = x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1088x + 4624$.\n    We can write $xP(x) = S(x)^2 - 32x - 4624$.\n    For large $x$, $xP(x)$ is smaller than $S(x)^2$.\n    Let's compare $xP(x)$ with $(S(x)-1)^2 = S(x)^2 - 2S(x) + 1 = S(x)^2 - 2(x^2-8x-68)+1 = S(x)^2 - 2x^2+16x+137$.\n    We find that for $x \\ge 63$, we have the strict inequalities $(S(x)-1)^2 < xP(x) < S(x)^2$.\n    This means for $x \\ge 63$, $xP(x)$ lies strictly between two consecutive integer squares, so it cannot be a perfect square itself.\n    If $P(x) = y^2$, then $xP(x) = xy^2$. For $xy^2$ to be a square, $x$ must be a perfect square (of the form $k^2$ with no square-free part). But if $x$ is a perfect square, $xy^2 = k^2y^2 = (ky)^2$ is a perfect square. This contradicts our finding that $xP(x)$ cannot be a perfect square for $x \\ge 63$.\n    Therefore, there are no integer solutions for $x \\ge 63$.\n\n3.  **Final Search Range**:\n    Combining these observations, we only need to search for integer solutions in the range $x \\in [-7, 62]$.\n\n4.  **Computation**:\n    I will write a Python script to iterate through all integers from -7 to 62. For each $x$, it calculates $P(x)$ and checks if it's a perfect square. The script will count and list the solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of integers x for which x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    \n    # We determined that solutions can only exist for x in the range [-7, 62].\n    for x in range(-7, 63):\n        # Calculate the value of the polynomial\n        val = x**3 - 16*x**2 - 72*x + 1056\n        \n        # Check if the value is a perfect square\n        if val >= 0:\n            sqrt_val = math.isqrt(val)\n            if sqrt_val * sqrt_val == val:\n                count += 1\n                print(f\"Solution found for x = {x}:\")\n                # As requested, output the equation for each solution.\n                # Note that for negative x, parentheses are added for clarity.\n                if x < 0:\n                    print(f\"({x})^3 - 16*({x})^2 - 72*({x}) + 1056 = {val} = {sqrt_val}^2\")\n                else:\n                    print(f\"{x}^3 - 16*{x}^2 - 72*{x} + 1056 = {val} = {sqrt_val}^2\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of integers found: {count}\")\n    \nsolve()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
