    "This task requires tracing a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb through its descendants in Proto-Germanic and several older Germanic languages. This involves applying a series of historical sound changes.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the PIE form:** Start with the given PIE form `*seh₂gieti`. I will identify the root, the suffix, and the ending. The provided cognates (Hittite `sākizzi`, Latin `sāgīre`) confirm the root is `*sāg-`, meaning 'to track' or 'to seek out'.\n2.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):** I will apply the relevant sound laws, primarily Grimm's Law, which shifts consonants (e.g., `*g` > `*k`), and the regular vowel change where PIE `*ā` becomes PGmc `*ō`. I will also determine the correct form for the 3rd person singular present tense verb ending.\n3.  **Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON):** I will apply changes specific to the North Germanic branch, such as i-umlaut (where a following `i` or `j` changes a back vowel like `ō` to a front vowel like `œ`/`æ`) and the evolution of the verb ending.\n4.  **Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE):** I will apply sound changes relevant to the West Germanic branch, specifically Old English. This includes i-umlaut (where `ō` becomes `ē`) and the palatalization of consonants (where `k` before a front vowel becomes `ċ`, pronounced /tʃ/).\n5.  **Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG):** Finally, I will apply the sound changes that characterize Old High German, most notably the High German Consonant Shift (where `k` becomes `hh`) and the specific vowel developments (where `ō` becomes `uo`).\n\nI will present the results in a clear, step-by-step manner using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the etymology of a PIE verb through Germanic languages.\n    \"\"\"\n    pie_form = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    meaning = \"'(s)he’s giving a sign / seeking'\"\n    pie_root = \"*sāg-\" # The root, clarified from *seh₂g-\n\n    # Step 1: Proto-Germanic\n    # PIE *sāg- > PGmc *sōk- (Grimm's Law: g > k; Vowel shift: ā > ō)\n    # PIE 3sg present *-eti > PGmc *-iþi / *-iþ\n    # The verb is a class 1 weak verb (*sōkjaną). 3sg present is *sōkiþ.\n    pgmc_form = \"*sōkiþ\"\n\n    # Step 2: Old Norse\n    # PGmc *sōkiþ > ON sækir\n    # i-umlaut: *ō > œ/æ (caused by the *i of the stem)\n    # Ending: *-iþ > -ir\n    on_form = \"sækir\"\n\n    # Step 3: Old English\n    # PGmc *sōkiþ > OE sēceþ\n    # i-umlaut: *ō > ē\n    # Palatalization: *k > ċ (/tʃ/) before front vowel i\n    # Ending: *-iþ > -eþ\n    oe_form = \"sēceþ\"\n\n    # Step 4: Old High German\n    # PGmc *sōkiþ > OHG suohhit\n    # Vowel shift: *ō > uo\n    # High German Consonant Shift: *k > hh (/x/)\n    # Ending: *-iþ > -it\n    ohg_form = \"suohhit\"\n\n    # Print the results in a clear, chained format\n    print(f\"The PIE form {pie_form}, with root {pie_root}, meaning {meaning}, develops as follows:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Proto-Indo-European: *seh₂gieti\")\n    print(\"    ↓\")\n    print(f\"Proto-Germanic: {pgmc_form}\")\n    print(\"    ↓\")\n    print(f\"    ├─ Old Norse: {on_form}\")\n    print(f\"    ├─ Old English: {oe_form}\")\n    print(f\"    └─ Old High German: {ohg_form}\")\n\ntrace_etymology()\n```\n<<<PIE *seh2gieti > Proto-Germanic *sōkiþ > Old Norse sækir, Old English sēceþ, and Old High German suohhit.>>>"
