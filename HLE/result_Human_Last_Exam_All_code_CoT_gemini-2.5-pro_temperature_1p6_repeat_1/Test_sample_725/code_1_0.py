    # which is physically dependent on the overlap of atomic orbitals.

    print("Covalency in a chemical bond describes the degree to which electrons are shared between atoms.")
    print("The physical basis for this sharing is the overlap of atomic orbitals from the participating atoms.")
    print("Therefore, a greater degree of orbital overlap leads to more effective electron sharing and, consequently, a stronger covalent character in the bond.\n")

    print("Step 2: Applying the Principle to the Given Complexes")
    print("The problem states that the orbital overlap between Cerium's 4f orbitals and the ligand orbitals is greater in CeF6(2-) than in CeCl6(2-).\n")

    # Step 3: Draw the conclusion.
    print("Step 3: Conclusion")
    print("Since CeF6(2-) has greater orbital overlap, it facilitates more effective electron sharing between the Ce(IV) center and the F- ligands.")
    print("This results in CeF6(2-) displaying stronger covalency compared to CeCl6(2-).\n")

    # There are no numerical values or equations in this problem.
    # The final answer is a qualitative term.
    print("Final Answer: The complex with higher overlap, CeF6(2-), displays stronger covalency.")
