    Analyzes the feasibility of generating an arbitrary vector beam
    from a linearly polarized input using the described optical system.
    """

    # Step 1: Define Input and Desired Output in terms of polarization
    # The input is a beam with a controlled spatial profile but a fixed linear polarization.
    # Its Jones vector can be written as [E_in(x, y), 0], where E_in is a controllable complex scalar field.
    # The other polarization component is zero everywhere.
    # The desired output is an ARBITRARY vector beam. This means its polarization is spatially
    # non-uniform. Its Jones vector is [E_x_out(x, y), E_y_out(x, y)], where BOTH E_x_out and
    # E_y_out are arbitrary, independent complex scalar fields.

    # Step 2: Analyze the system's components
    # The system consists of free space propagation and a "phase-shaping medium".
    # - Free Space Propagation: This is a scalar phenomenon described by diffraction theory. It changes
    #   the amplitude and phase (the E_in(x, y) part) but does NOT affect the polarization state.
    #   It cannot create a 'y' polarization component if one doesn't exist.
    # - Phase-Shaping Medium: This term typically describes an element like a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM)
    #   or a simple diffuser. These elements apply a position-dependent phase shift to the incoming light.
    #   Crucially, they are scalar devices, meaning they apply the same phase shift to any polarization present.
    #   They cannot transform one polarization state into another (e.g., horizontal to vertical).

    # Step 3: Conclusion based on the nature of the optical elements
    # The entire optical system described (free space -> phase-shaper -> free space) is composed of
    # SCALAR elements. A scalar system acts on the input Jones vector [E_in(x, y), 0] as follows:
    #   Output = System_Operator * [E_in, 0] = [System_Operator(E_in), 0]
    # No matter how complex the scalar operator is, it can never generate a non-zero orthogonal
    # polarization component. The output will always be linearly polarized in the same direction as the input.

    # Step 4: A more general argument about degrees of freedom
    # Let's consider the most generous interpretation, where the "transmission matrix" could couple
    # polarizations. The input field offers a certain number of spatial degrees of freedom (e.g., N modes or pixels)
    # but ONLY for one polarization state. So, you can control N parameters.
    # The desired arbitrary vector beam output requires control over BOTH polarization components for each
    # spatial degree of freedom. This means you need to specify 2*N parameters.
    # You are trying to control a 2*N-dimensional output space using an N-dimensional input space.
    # This is fundamentally impossible. You cannot create an *arbitrary* output because you have
    # insufficient input degrees of freedom. You can only generate a specific subset of vector beams
    # that are dictated by the fixed properties of the medium.

    # Step 5: Final conclusion
    # The final answer is no. To generate an arbitrary vector beam from a linearly polarized input,
    # one would need polarization-dependent optical elements (e.g., q-plates, metasurfaces,
    # birefringent waveplates) and/or control over both polarization components at the input.
    # The system as described lacks these capabilities. The second part of the setup involving the
    # inverse matrix describes phase conjugation, which also does not change the polarization state.

    print("1. An input beam with 'fixed linear polarization' means it has only one polarization component, e.g., its Jones vector is of the form [E(x,y), 0].")
    print("2. A desired 'arbitrary vector beam' output requires two independent, non-zero polarization components, e.g., a Jones vector [Ex_out(x,y), Ey_out(x,y)].")
    print("3. The optical elements described - free space and a standard 'phase-shaping medium' (like an SLM) - are scalar operators. They can change the amplitude and phase of a light field, but they cannot change its polarization state.")
    print("4. A scalar system cannot create a vertical polarization component from a purely horizontal input. The polarization of the output beam will be identical to the input beam.")
    print("5. Even in the most general case, a linearly polarized input provides N controllable degrees of freedom (for N spatial modes). An arbitrary vector beam output requires controlling 2*N degrees of freedom (N modes for each of two polarizations). It is impossible to fully control a 2*N-dimensional space with N inputs.")
