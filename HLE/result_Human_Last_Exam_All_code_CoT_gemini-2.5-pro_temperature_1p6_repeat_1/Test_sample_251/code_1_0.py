# The problem asks for the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for a specific Lagrangian
# submanifold in CP^4. The solution is based on established theorems in symplectic geometry.

# Step 1: Count disks for the base Lagrangian.
# The base object is the Chekanov torus in CP^2.
# According to the literature (e.g., works by Auroux, Chekanov), the Chekanov torus
# is distinguished by having exactly 2 Maslov 2 holomorphic disks.
n_disks_chekanov_torus = 2

# Step 2: Analyze the effect of the Biran lift.
# The Chekanov torus is lifted from CP^2 to CP^3 and then to CP^4.
# A key theorem in this area states that the count of minimal Maslov index disks
# (which are the Maslov 2 disks in this case) is preserved under the monotone Biran lift.
# Therefore, each lift does not add new disks of this type.
additional_disks_after_first_lift = 0
additional_disks_after_second_lift = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of disks.
# The total number is the sum of the initial disks and any additional disks
# generated by the lifts.
total_disks = n_disks_chekanov_torus + additional_disks_after_first_lift + additional_disks_after_second_lift

# Final step: Print the reasoning in the form of an equation.
# The final result is obtained by the following equation:
print("The final count of disks is derived from the following logic:")
print(f"Initial disks (Chekanov torus in CP^2): {n_disks_chekanov_torus}")
print(f"Additional disks from lift (CP^2 -> CP^3): {additional_disks_after_first_lift}")
print(f"Additional disks from lift (CP^3 -> CP^4): {additional_disks_after_second_lift}")
print("---")
print("Equation for the total number of disks:")
print(f"{n_disks_chekanov_torus} + {additional_disks_after_first_lift} + {additional_disks_after_second_lift} = {total_disks}")
print("\nTherefore, the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks is:")
print(total_disks)
