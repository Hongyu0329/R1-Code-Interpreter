# The problem asks for the gate capacitance, C_g, based on observations
# of the Quantum Hall effect.
# The derived formula for the gate capacitance per unit area is:
# C_g = (2 * e^2 * B) / (h * V_1)
# where:
# e is the elementary charge
# B is the magnetic field
# h is Planck's constant
# V_1 is the base voltage unit from the problem statement

print("The formula for the gate capacitance per unit area (C_g) has been derived.")

# We define the numerical constant from the equation to explicitly output it.
