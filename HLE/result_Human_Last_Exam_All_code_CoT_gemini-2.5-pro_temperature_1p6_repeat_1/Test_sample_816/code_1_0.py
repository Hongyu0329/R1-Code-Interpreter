    print("Step 2: Relate the Marangoni Effect to the specific material.")
    print(f"For most pure metals, dγ/dT is negative. This means the hot center has the lowest surface tension, and the fluid flows outwards to the cooler edges.")

    print("Step 3: Determine the flow direction for 304 Stainless Steel.")
    print("In steels with sufficient surface-active elements, dγ/dT becomes positive. This means surface tension is highest at the hottest point (the center of the pool).")
    print("This high central surface tension pulls the surrounding liquid metal from the cooler outer portions inwards.\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluate other forces.")
    print("- Arc Drag and Arc Pressure forces primarily push the fluid outwards and down from the center.")
    print("- Lorentz (electromagnetic) force creates an inward 'pinch', but the Marangoni effect is the dominant driver of the surface flow pattern described.")
    print("- Buoyancy forces are much weaker and are overshadowed by these other effects.\n")
