    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, we can use a method based on row operations, which is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define Matrices**: We will represent the given polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, using Python's `sympy` library, which is ideal for symbolic mathematics.\n    *   P1 = [s² + s, -s; -s² - 1, s²]\n    *   P2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\n2.  **Stack Matrices**: We will form a single 4x2 matrix `M` by stacking P1 on top of P2.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n\n3.  **Perform Elementary Row Operations**: We will apply a series of elementary row operations to the stacked matrix `M`. The goal of these operations is to transform `M` into a block matrix of the form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is the 2x2 zero matrix. The non-zero matrix `G` at the top is a GCRD. The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n4.  **Normalize the GCRD**: The resulting matrix `G` can be further simplified to a canonical form, typically the row-echelon form or Hermite normal form. If the GCRD simplifies to the identity matrix, it means the original matrices P1 and P2 are \"right coprime\".\n\n5.  **Output the Result**: The final simplified matrix `G` will be printed, with each of its elements clearly stated.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sp.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Given polynomial matrices:\")\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sp.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sp.pprint(P2)\n\n    # Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    # Step 2: Reorder rows to have lower-degree polynomials at the top.\n    # Swap R1 <-> R3 and R2 <-> R4 for easier computation.\n    M.row_swap(0, 2)\n    M.row_swap(1, 3)\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Reorder rows to have lower degrees on top\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    # Step 3: Perform elementary row operations to introduce zeros.\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Perform row reduction to find the GCRD.\")\n    # The '1' in the new R2 (M[1,:]) is useful for elimination.\n\n    # R3 -> R3 + s*R2\n    # [s**2+s, -s] + s*[-s-1, 1] = [s**2+s - s**2-s, -s+s] = [0, 0]\n    M[2, :] = sp.simplify(M[2, :] + s * M[1, :])\n    print(\"\\nAfter R3 -> R3 + s*R2:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    # R4 -> R4 - s**2 * R2\n    # [-s**2-1, s**2] - s**2*[-s-1, 1] = [-s**2-1 - (-s**3-s**2), s**2-s**2] = [s**3-1, 0]\n    M[3, :] = sp.simplify(M[3, :] - s**2 * M[1, :])\n    print(\"\\nAfter R4 -> R4 - s^2*R2:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    # R4 -> R4 - s**2 * R1\n    # [s**3-1, 0] - s**2*[s, 0] = [s**3-1-s**3, 0] = [-1, 0]\n    M[3, :] = sp.simplify(M[3, :] - s**2 * M[0, :])\n    print(\"\\nAfter R4 -> R4 - s^2*R1:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    # Swap R1 and R4 to get a constant in the top-left position\n    M.row_swap(0, 3)\n    print(\"\\nAfter swapping R1 and R4:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    # R4 -> R4 + s*R1\n    # [s, 0] + s*[-1, 0] = [0, 0]\n    M[3, :] = sp.simplify(M[3, :] + s * M[0, :])\n    print(\"\\nAfter R4 -> R4 + s*R1:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    # The top 2x2 matrix is a GCRD\n    G = M[:2, :]\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: A GCRD is the non-zero part of the matrix:\")\n    sp.pprint(G)\n\n    # Step 5: Normalize the GCRD to its simplest form (Hermite Normal Form)\n    # R1 -> -1 * R1 to make the pivot 1.\n    G[0, :] = -1 * G[0, :]\n\n    # R2 -> R2 + (s+1) * R1 to make the matrix upper-triangular.\n    G[1, :] = sp.simplify(G[1, :] + (s+1) * G[0, :])\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Normalize the GCRD to its simplest form (Identity Matrix):\")\n    sp.pprint(G)\n\n    # Final result output\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50)\n    print(\"The final Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) is the identity matrix:\")\n    print(\"G = [[1, 0],\")\n    print(\"     [0, 1]]\")\n    print(\"\\nThe elements of the final GCRD matrix G are:\")\n    print(f\"G[0, 0] = {G[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"G[0, 1] = {G[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"G[1, 0] = {G[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"G[1, 1] = {G[1,1]}\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_gcrd()\n\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
