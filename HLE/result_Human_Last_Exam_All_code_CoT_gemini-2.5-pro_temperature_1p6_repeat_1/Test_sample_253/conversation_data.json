    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\n1.  **Define Rule 110:** I will first codify the rules of the Rule 110 cellular automaton. This rule determines the state (0 or 1) of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. The complete rule set is:\n    *   `111` -> `0`\n    *   `110` -> `1`\n    *   `101` -> `1`\n    *   `100` -> `0`\n    *   `011` -> `1`\n    *   `010` -> `1`\n    *   `001` -> `1`\n    *   `000` -> `0`\n    I will store this logic in a dictionary for easy lookup.\n\n2.  **Initialize the Automaton:** The simulation starts with a single cell in state 1, surrounded by cells in state 0. I'll create a list of numbers (a \"tape\") to represent this, making it wide enough to allow the pattern to expand for 20 steps without hitting the edges. A single '1' will be placed in the center of this list.\n\n3.  **Run the Simulation:** I will loop 20 times to simulate 20 generations. In each step:\n    *   I'll create a new, empty list for the next generation.\n    *   I'll scan across the current list of cells, examining each 3-cell neighborhood (the cell itself and its two neighbors).\n    *   Using the Rule 110 dictionary, I will determine the state of the central cell for that neighborhood in the next generation and place it in the new list.\n    *   After scanning all neighborhoods, I will replace the old generation's list with the newly created one.\n\n4.  **Format and Print the Final Result:** After 20 generations, the simulation is complete. The list will contain the final pattern, but it will be padded with leading and trailing zeros. I will trim these extra zeros and then print the resulting binary sequence.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton for 20 generations\n    starting from a single '1' cell and prints the final pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of generations to simulate\n    num_generations = 20\n    \n    # Set a width large enough for the pattern to evolve without boundary issues.\n    # The pattern grows at most one cell per side per generation.\n    # Width = 2 * generations + some padding.\n    width = 2 * num_generations + 21\n    \n    # Rule 110 mapping.
