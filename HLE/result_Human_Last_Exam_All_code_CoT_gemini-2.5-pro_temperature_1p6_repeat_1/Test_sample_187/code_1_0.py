    Identifies the lines with programming errors in the triangle.py file.
    
    The analysis reveals the following errors:
    1.  Lines 11, 29, 30, 31: The '^' operator is used for exponentiation. In a .py file,
        this is the bitwise XOR operator. This leads to incorrect calculations and/or
        TypeErrors. The correct operator for exponentiation in Python is '**'.
    2.  Lines 22, 23: The '/' operator is used for division. When dividing Python integers,
        this results in float division (e.g., 1/3 = 0.333...). The specification
        requires precise rational numbers (e.g., 1/3 as a Sage Rational), which this
        code fails to produce.
