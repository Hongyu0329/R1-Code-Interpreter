The provided text clearly outlines the treatment guidelines for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
The question concerns the recommended treatment after the disease progresses on a first-line therapy, which is the second-line setting.

The text states: "In 2022 TDXd [fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan] replaced T-DM1 as second-line therapy on the basis of superior results reported in the {second_line_therapy_trial} trial. This head-to-head comparison ... demonstrated not only the superior response and PFS benefit of TDXd but also an improvement in OS.[{second_line_trial_citations[0]}, {second_line_trial_citations[1]}]"

The text further summarizes the current NCCN guidelines: "Upon disease progression TDXd is recommended in the second-line setting."

Therefore, based on the text, Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (C) is the NCCN-recommended therapy in this scenario.
