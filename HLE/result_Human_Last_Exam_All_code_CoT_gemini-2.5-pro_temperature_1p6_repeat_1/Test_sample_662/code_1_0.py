# Given parameters
R0 = 3.0  # Basic Reproduction Number
breakthrough_infection_rate = 0.06  # 6% of vaccinated people get infected

# Step 1: Calculate Vaccine Effectiveness (VE)
# VE is the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are protected from infection.
vaccine_effectiveness = 1 - breakthrough_infection_rate

# Step 2: Calculate the herd immunity threshold proportion (critical_coverage_p)
# This is the minimum proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated.
# The formula is Pc = (1 - 1/R0) / VE
critical_coverage_p = (1 - 1 / R0) / vaccine_effectiveness

# Step 3: Print the explanation and the final equation
print("To prevent the epidemic, we need to calculate the critical vaccination coverage (Pc) to achieve herd immunity.")
print("The formula, accounting for a vaccine that is not 100% effective, is: Pc = (1 - 1 / R₀) / VE\n")

print("Here are the values we will use in the equation:")
print(f"R₀ (Basic Reproduction Number) = {R0}")
print(f"Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) = 1 - {breakthrough_infection_rate} = {vaccine_effectiveness}\n")

print("Plugging the numbers into the formula:")
# Display the equation with the numbers
numerator = 1 - 1 / R0
print(f"Pc = (1 - 1 / {R0}) / {vaccine_effectiveness}")
print(f"Pc = ({numerator:.4f}) / {vaccine_effectiveness}")
print(f"Pc = {critical_coverage_p:.4f}\n")

# Convert the result to a percentage and display it
print(f"Therefore, the theoretical threshold of vaccine coverage your state should reach is approximately {critical_coverage_p:.1%}.")

# Final answer in the requested format
final_answer_percentage = critical_coverage_p * 100
# print(f"<<<{final_answer_percentage:.1f}>>>")
