    "To determine the oligomeric state of the given protein coiled-coil sequence, we need to analyze the repeating pattern of its amino acids, specifically the residues at the core positions which dictate the packing of the helices. This analysis is based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, dictating how the helices pack together. We will write a script to find the most likely heptad repeat frame by identifying the register with the most consistently hydrophobic core.\n2.  **Analyze Core Residues:** Once the correct frame is identified, we will examine the types of amino acids found at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n3.  **Apply Packing Rules:** The size, shape, and branching of the side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions determine the most efficient packing arrangement and, therefore, the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Often formed by patterns like `a=L, d=L` or `a=A, d=L`. Leucine at the 'd' position is a classic sign of a dimer.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Often contains Isoleucine at the 'a' position and Leucine at the 'd' position (`a=I, d=L`).\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Often contains branched, bulky residues like Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions (`a=I, d=I`).\n4.  **Conclude Oligomeric State:** Based on the identified pattern and packing rules, we will determine the most probable oligomeric state.\n\nThe following Python script automates this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a protein sequence to determine its likely coiled-coil oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    heptad_labels = \"abcdefg\"\n    # Key hydrophobic residues that typically form the core\n    hydrophobic_residues = {'I', 'L', 'V', 'M', 'A', 'F', 'W'}\n\n    best_frame_info = {\n        'start_pos': -1,\n        'score': -1,\n        'a_residues': [],\n        'd_residues': []\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the optimal heptad repeat frame.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\")\n    print(\"Scoring 7 possible frames based on hydrophobicity at 'a' and 'd' positions...\")\n\n    # Iterate through all 7 possible frames.
