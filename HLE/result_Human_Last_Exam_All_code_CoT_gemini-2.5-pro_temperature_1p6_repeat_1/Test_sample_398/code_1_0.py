    print("Step 1: Understand the definitions.")
    print("  - G is a maximal planar graph. This means it's a planar graph, and adding any edge between non-adjacent vertices makes it non-planar.")
    print("  - G' = G U {e}, where e is an edge not in G.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Determine if G' is planar.")
    print("  - By the definition of a maximal planar graph, adding the edge 'e' to G makes the resulting graph G' non-planar.")
    print("  - This immediately eliminates answer choices that claim G' has a plane drawing (a drawing with zero crossings).")
    print("  - Therefore, options A and D are false.")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Determine the crossing number of G'.")
    print("  - The crossing number is the minimum number of crossings required to draw a graph in the plane.")
    print("  - A known theorem states that for a maximal planar graph G (with n>=4 vertices), the graph G' = G U {e} has a crossing number of exactly 1.")
    print("  - This means G' can always be drawn with exactly one crossing.")
    print("  - This fact refutes option C, which suggests that G' might require more than one crossing.")

    print("\nStep 4: Determine the uniqueness of the one-crossing drawing.")
    print("  - We need to decide between option B (drawing is not unique) and E (drawing is unique).")
    print("  - A drawing with one crossing is created by choosing an edge 'f' from G to be crossed by the new edge 'e'.")
    print("  - In general, there are multiple choices for the edge 'f' that can be crossed by 'e' to achieve a single-crossing drawing.")
    print("  - For example, in the octahedron graph (which is maximal planar), adding a 'long diagonal' edge can be done by crossing one of several different edges of the octahedron, leading to different drawings.")
    print("  - Since different choices of the crossed edge 'f' lead to combinatorially different drawings, the one-crossing drawing of G' is not unique.")
    print("  - This refutes option E.")

    print("\nStep 5: Conclude the correct statement.")
    print("  - Based on the analysis, G' can be drawn with at most one crossing (specifically, exactly one), and this drawing is not unique.")
    print("  - This corresponds to option B.")
