    "To find an analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small $\\epsilon$, we can analyze the behavior of the integrand as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the dominant part of the integral**: Let the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + h(x)$, where $h(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. For small $\\epsilon$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{D(x, \\epsilon)}$ becomes very large where $h(x)$ is small. The function $h(x)$ is minimized at $x=0$ on the integration interval $[0, 15.00]$, with $h(0)=0$. Therefore, the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the function $h(x)$**: For small $x$, the term with the lowest power of $x$ dominates. So, we can approximate $h(x)$ by its leading term:\n    $h(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$\n\n3.  **Approximate the integral**: We can now approximate the integral by replacing $h(x)$ with its approximation. We also extend the upper integration limit from 15.00 to $\\infty$. This is justified because for small $\\epsilon$, the integrand is sharply peaked at $x=0$ and decays rapidly, making the contribution from large $x$ (including $x > 15.00$) negligible compared to the contribution from the peak.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n4.  **Solve the approximate integral analytically**: This integral can be solved using a variable substitution. The general result for such integrals leads to a formula of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{-a}$. The steps are:\n    *   Let $x = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u$. Then $dx = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} du$.\n    *   Substituting this into the integral gives:\n        $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{du}{1+u^5} = \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{du}{1+u^5}$\n    *   The definite integral is a known result: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{du}{1+u^n} = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$.\n    *   For our case, $n=5$, so the integral is $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n5.  **Assemble the final formula**: Combining these results gives the approximation $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{-a}$ with:\n    *   $a = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 = 0.8$\n    *   $C = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical values for $C$ and $a$ and prints the resulting analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes the parameters for the analytical approximation of the given integral\n    for the small epsilon regime.\n    The approximation is of the form I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon^(-a).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # From the denominator h(x) = 9.0*x^5.0 + 5.0*x^6.0 + 9.0*x^8.0,\n    # we identify the leading term for small x, which is h(x) ≈ c0 * x^p.\n    c0 = 9.0\n    p = 5.0\n\n    # The exponent 'a' in the approximation I(epsilon) ∝ epsilon^(-a)\n    # is given by a = 1 - 1/p.\n    a = 1.0 - (1.0 / p)\n\n    # The coefficient C is given by the formula:\n    # C = pi / (p * c0^(1/p) * sin(pi/p))\n    C = math.pi / (p * math.pow(c0, 1.0/p) * math.sin(math.pi/p))\n\n    # Output the results in a clear format.\n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon^(-a)\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on the leading term h(x) ≈ 9.0 * x^5.0:\")\n    \n    # Output each number in the final equation as requested.\n    # The numbers are the coefficient C and the exponent -a.\n    print(\"\\nThe parameters are:\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient C = {C:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent value -a = -{a}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) ≈ {C:.6f} * epsilon^(-{a})\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    get_integral_approximation()\n```\n<<<0.689104>>>"
