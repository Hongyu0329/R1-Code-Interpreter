    "This is a problem in mathematical analysis, specifically in fractal geometry and additive combinatorics. The answer is a well-known theoretical result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the key terms:**\n    *   A **Sidon set** `S` (in the reals) is a set where for any `x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄ ∈ S`, the equation `x₁ + x₂ = x₃ + x₄` implies that `{x₁, x₂}` and `{x₃, x₄}` are the same pair of numbers.\n    *   The **Hausdorff dimension** is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set.\n\n2.  **State the theoretical result:** The maximum possible Hausdorff dimension for a Sidon set `S ⊂ [0, 1]` is exactly 1/2. This result comes in two parts:\n    *   **Upper Bound:** It can be proven that any Sidon set in `[0, 1]` must have a Hausdorff dimension less than or equal to 1/2. This is a non-trivial theorem.\n    *   **Lower Bound:** We can construct Sidon sets in `[0, 1]` whose Hausdorff dimension is arbitrarily close to 1/2. This shows that 1/2 is the \"least upper bound\" or the maximum.\n\n3.  **Demonstrate with code:** I will write a Python script to demonstrate the construction that achieves this lower bound. The construction builds a fractal set using digits from an integer Sidon set.\n    *   It is known that for any prime `q`, a Sidon set of integers `D` exists with size `|D| = q` inside the range `{0, ..., q²-1}`.\n    *   We can create a fractal set (like a Cantor set) of numbers in `[0, 1]` using base-`b` expansions with digits from `D`. To ensure the resulting set is a Sidon set, we must choose a base `b` large enough to avoid carries in additions, for example, `b = 2q²`.\n    *   The Hausdorff dimension of such a set is `dim_H = log(|D|) / log(b) = log(q) / log(2q²)`.\n    *   As we choose a larger and larger prime `q`, this dimension gets closer and closer to 1/2. The script will calculate this value for a very large `q` to numerically show this limit.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:** The code will then print the final, exact answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef demonstrate_sidon_dimension_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that the Hausdorff dimension of a constructed\n    Sidon set can get arbitrarily close to 1/2.\n\n    The dimension of the constructed set is given by the formula:\n    dim = log(q) / log(2 * q^2)\n    where q is the size of the underlying integer Sidon set.\n\n    By taking the limit as q -> infinity, we can find the maximum dimension\n    achievable with this method.\n    limit(q->inf) [log(q) / log(2*q^2)]\n    = limit(q->inf) [log(q) / (log(2) + 2*log(q))]\n    Dividing the numerator and denominator by log(q):\n    = limit(q->inf) [1 / (log(2)/log(q) + 2)]\n    As q -> inf, log(q) -> inf, so log(2)/log(q) -> 0.\n    The limit is 1 / (0 + 2) = 1/2.\n\n    The following code calculates the dimension for a very large 'q' to\n    numerically verify this limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Choose a very large number for q to approximate infinity\n    q = 10**200\n\n    # Calculate the dimension using the formula\n    dimension = math.log(q) / math.log(2 * q**2)\n    \n    print(\"Demonstration of the limit:\")\n    print(f\"For a large construction parameter q = {q:.1e},\")\n    print(f\"The calculated Hausdorff dimension is: {dimension}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis demonstrates the dimension approaching the theoretical maximum.\")\n\n    # The exact maximum value is a known mathematical result.\n    numerator = 1\n    denominator = 2\n    result = numerator / denominator\n\n    print(\"\\nThe theoretical maximum Hausdorff dimension is a fixed value.\")\n    print(f\"The final answer is the fraction: {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"Which equals: {result}\")\n\n\ndemonstrate_sidon_dimension_limit()\n\n```\n<<<0.5>>>"
