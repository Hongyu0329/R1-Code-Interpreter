    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can follow these steps:\n1.  **Compute the Betti numbers of X.** These numbers give us the ranks of the homology groups, which are crucial for the subsequent steps. The Betti numbers can be derived from the Euler characteristic of the hypersurface.\n2.  **Use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups.** By considering the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$, we can relate the homotopy groups of $X$ to those of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ and the relative homotopy groups.\n3.  **Apply the Rational Hurewicz Theorem.** This theorem connects the rank of a homotopy group (the dimension of its rationalization) to the dimension of the corresponding homology group with rational coefficients.\n4.  **Use the long exact sequence of homology groups.** This allows us to compute the required relative homology group and finalize the calculation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the Betti numbers of $X$. A smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is a complex manifold of dimension $n-1$. In our case, $n=3$ and $d=5$, so $X$ is a complex surface (real dimension 4). Its Betti numbers $b_k(X)$ are known to be equal to those of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n-1} = \\mathbb{CP}^2$ for $k \\neq n-1=2$.\n-   $b_0(X) = b_0(\\mathbb{CP}^2) = 1$\n-   $b_1(X) = b_1(\\mathbb{CP}^2) = 0$\n-   $b_3(X) = b_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2) = 0$\n-   $b_4(X) = b_4(\\mathbb{CP}^2) = 1$\n\nThe remaining Betti number, $b_2(X)$, can be found using the formula for the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$:\n$\\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} (-1)^k b_k(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a degree-$d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is given by:\n$\\chi(X_d) = d \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n+1}{j} (-d)^{n-1-j}$\n\nPlugging in $n=3$ and $d=5$, we can compute $\\chi(X)$ and then $b_2(X)$. With these values, we can proceed with the topological argument to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$. The following Python code performs this calculation and lays out the logical steps to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Computes the binomial coefficient n choose k.\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    return math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n - k))\n\ndef euler_characteristic_hypersurface(n, d):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Euler characteristic of a smooth hypersurface of degree d in CP^n.\"\"\"\n    chi = 0\n    for j in range(n):\n        chi += combinations(n + 1, j) * ((-d)**(n - 1 - j))\n    chi *= d\n    return chi\n\ndef solve_pi3_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Betti numbers and explains the steps to find the rank of pi_3(X).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3  # Ambient space is CP^3\n    d = 5  # Hypersurface is quintic\n\n    # Step 1: Compute Betti numbers of X\n    chi_X = euler_characteristic_hypersurface(n, d)\n    \n    # b_k(X) = b_k(CP^{n-1}) for k != n-1.\n    # For n=3, X is a surface (dim_C = 2). b_k(X) = b_k(CP^2) for k != 2.\n    b0_X = 1\n    b1_X = 0\n    b3_X = 0 # by Poincare duality b3=b1\n    b4_X = 1 # by Poincare duality b4=b0\n\n    # From chi(X) = b0 - b1 + b2 - b3 + b4 = 1 - 0 + b2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b2\n    b2_X = chi_X - 2\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Compute the Betti numbers for the quintic hypersurface X.\")\n    print(f\"The Euler characteristic of X is chi(X) = {chi_X}.\")\n    print(f\"The Betti numbers of X are:\")\n    print(f\"b0(X) = {b0_X}\")\n    print(f\"b1(X) = {b1_X}\")\n    print(f\"b2(X) = {b2_X}\")\n    print(f\"b3(X) = {b3_X}\")\n    print(f\"b4(X) = {b4_X}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Relate pi_3(X) to a relative homotopy group.\")\n    print(\"From the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair (CP^3, X):\")\n    print(\"... -> pi_4(CP^3) -> pi_4(CP^3, X) -> pi_3(X) -> pi_3(CP^3) -> ...\")\n    print(\"For CP^n, pi_k(CP^n) = pi_k(S^{2n+1}) for k >= 2.\")\n    print(\"For CP^3, pi_3(CP^3) = pi_3(S^7) = 0 and pi_4(CP^3) = pi_4(S^7) = 0.\")\n    print(\"The sequence simplifies to: 0 -> pi_4(CP^3, X) -> pi_3(X) -> 0.\")\n    print(\"This implies pi_3(X) is isomorphic to pi_4(CP^3, X).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Relate the relative homotopy group to a relative homology group.\")\n    print(\"The rank of pi_3(X) is equal to the rank of pi_4(CP^3, X).\")\n    print(\"By the rational Hurewicz theorem for a 2-connected pair (like (CP^3, X)),\")\n    print(\"rank(pi_4(CP^3, X)) = dim_Q H_4(CP^3, X; Q).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Compute the dimension of the relative homology group.\")\n    print(\"From the long exact sequence of homology for the pair (CP^3, X) with Q coefficients:\")\n    print(\"... -> H_4(X; Q) -> H_4(CP^3; Q) -> H_4(CP^3, X; Q) -> H_3(X; Q) -> ...\")\n    print(f\"We know H_3(X; Q) = 0 (since b3 = {b3_X}) and H_4(X; Q) is Q (since b4 = {b4_X}).\")\n    print(f\"Also, H_4(CP^3; Q) is Q.\")\n    print(\"The sequence becomes: Q -> Q -> H_4(CP^3, X; Q) -> 0.\")\n    print(\"The map H_4(X; Q) -> H_4(CP^3; Q) corresponds to inclusion and is multiplication by the degree d=5.\")\n    print(\"This map is an isomorphism on Q.
