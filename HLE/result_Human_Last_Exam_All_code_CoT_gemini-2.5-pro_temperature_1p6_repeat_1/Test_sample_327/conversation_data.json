    "To solve this problem, we need to find the simplest representation of the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue Hackenbush. The standard way to represent a positive dyadic rational number (a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator) is by using its binary expansion to construct a game \"stalk\".\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Convert the fraction to binary:** I will find the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$. Since this number is less than 1, its binary form will be of the type $0.b_1b_2b_3...$.\n2.  **Map binary digits to pieces:** In the standard construction, each digit in the binary representation after the decimal point corresponds to a game piece in a vertical stalk. A '1' corresponds to a blue piece, and a '0' corresponds to a red piece.\n3.  **Count the total pieces:** The total number of pieces needed is simply the number of digits in the terminating binary expansion of the fraction.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform the conversion to binary and count the number of resulting digits, which gives the total number of pieces. The script will also show the breakdown of red and blue pieces.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces needed to represent a fraction\n    in red-blue-Hackenbush using its binary expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
