    # 3. Halts.
    # 4. Returns a "yes" or "no" answer.

    # If the true answer to the question is indeed "yes", then this very
    # program is the algorithm that decides the problem. If the true answer
    # is "no", then a similar program that returns "no" is the decider.

    # a decider is guaranteed to exist. Therefore, the problem is decidable.
