    This function calculates the limiting probability P(n) as n -> infinity.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. For any of the 8 bases, say base 'x', its count c_x in a long random sequence
       will be such that (c_x mod 8) is uniformly distributed over {0, 1, ..., 7}.
    2. The replication process collapses if c_x mod 8 = x for any x. The probability
       of this happening for a specific x is 1/8.
    3. The probability of avoiding collapse for a specific base x is therefore 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.
    4. Since there are 8 independent conditions that must all be met for the replication
       to succeed, we multiply the probabilities.
    5. The final limiting probability is (7/8)^8.
