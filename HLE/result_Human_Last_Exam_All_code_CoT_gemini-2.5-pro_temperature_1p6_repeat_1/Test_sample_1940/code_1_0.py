    This function explains the reasoning and calculates the minimal number of CCZ gates.

    # Step 1: Interpret the allowed gates.
    # The term "arbitrary single-qubit rotations" implies that any single-qubit gate,
    # including the Hadamard (H) gate, is available at no cost in our metric (CCZ count).
    
    # Step 2: Establish gate equivalence due to the availability of Hadamard gates.
    # A CCZ gate can be converted to a Toffoli (CCNOT) gate, and vice-versa,
    # using Hadamard gates on the target qubit:
    # CCNOT(c1, c2, t) = H(t) * CCZ(c1, c2, t) * H(t)
    # This means that minimizing the number of CCZ gates is equivalent to
    # minimizing the number of Toffoli gates.

    # Step 3: Reframe the problem.
    # A CCCZ gate is equivalent to a 3-controlled-NOT (CÂ³-NOT) gate, also known
    # as a 4-qubit Toffoli gate, up to Hadamards on the target qubit.
    # Therefore, the problem is transformed into finding the minimal number of
    # 3-qubit Toffoli gates needed to construct a 4-qubit Toffoli gate without ancilla qubits.

    # Step 4: State the known optimal solution from quantum computing literature.
    # This is a well-researched problem in quantum circuit synthesis. The minimal
    # number of 3-qubit Toffoli gates required to implement a 4-qubit Toffoli gate
    # has been proven to be 6.
    
    # Step 5: Present the result as an equation.
    # The optimal construction consists of a sequence of 6 gates. We represent
    # the cost of each gate as 1.
