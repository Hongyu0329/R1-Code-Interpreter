1. Required Permeability of the Shell Material:
   To achieve non-distortion in the exterior, the permeability `mu` must satisfy:
   mu = -mu_0
   (where `mu_0` is the vacuum permeability). This corresponds to a relative
   permeability of -1, a property of magnetic metamaterials.

2. Magnetic Field in the Interior Region (rho < R1):
   With the permeability found above, the magnetic field inside the shell is uniform
   and given by the equation:
   H_int = H_0 * (R2/R1)**2 * x_hat
   where:
     `H_0` is the magnitude of the externally applied uniform field.
     `R1` is the interior radius of the shell.
     `R2` is the exterior radius of the shell.
     `x_hat` is the unit vector in the x-direction.
