    "To find the minimal discriminant of the curve $y^2=x^6 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 1$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type**: The equation is of the form $y^2 = f(x)$ where $f(x)$ is a sextic polynomial. This defines a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.\n2.  **Find the equivalent elliptic curve**: The term \"minimal discriminant\" refers to an invariant of an elliptic curve. The given curve has a rational point (e.g., $(-1, 0)$), which implies its Jacobian contains an elliptic curve that it is birationally equivalent to. We can use computational algebra software to find a Weierstrass model for this elliptic curve.\n3.  **Use PARI/GP**: The PARI/GP system is a powerful tool for number theory computations. We can use its Python wrapper, `cypari2`, to perform the necessary calculations. The `ellinit` function can determine the elliptic curve associated with the hyperelliptic equation.\n4.  **Find the minimal model and discriminant**: Once we have a model of the elliptic curve, the `ellminimalmodel` function can find its minimal Weierstrass model over the rational numbers. From this minimal model, we can extract the minimal discriminant.\n5.  **Show the calculation**: As requested, the script will not only output the final result but also display the intermediate values (the $b$-invariants) and the formula used to calculate the discriminant, with the values substituted in.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.
