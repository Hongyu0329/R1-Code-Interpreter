    "To solve the initial value problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the type of equation**: The given differential equation $x'(t)=(t-1)\\cdot x^2(t)$ is a separable differential equation.\n2.  **Separate the variables**: We can rearrange the equation to have all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other side:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt\n    $$\n3.  **Integrate both sides**: We integrate both sides to find the general solution.\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    This yields:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n4.  **Apply the initial condition**: We use the given initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the value of $C$. By substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution, we can solve for $C$.\n5.  **Find the particular solution**: With the value of $C$ determined, we have the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n6.  **Calculate x(1)**: Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the value of $x(1)$.\n\nThe following Python script implements these steps to calculate the final answer. It uses the `fractions` module to handle rational numbers accurately.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define the initial conditions\nt0 = 0\nx0 = -8\n# Define the target time\nt_target = 1\n\nprint(\"We are solving the initial value problem: x'(t) = (t-1) * x^2(t), with x(0) = -8.\")\nprint(\"The equation is separable and its general solution is of the form: -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\\n\")\n\n# Step 1: Use the initial condition x(0) = -8 to find the constant C\nprint(f\"Step 1: Find the constant C using the initial condition x({t0}) = {x0}.\")\nprint(\"Substitute t = 0 and x = -8 into the general solution:\")\n# Equation: -1/x0 = t0^2/2 - t0 + C\nC_lhs = Fraction(-1, x0)\nC_rhs_term1 = Fraction(t0**2, 2)\nC_rhs_term2 = -t0\nC = C_lhs - C_rhs_term1 - C_rhs_term2\n\nprint(f\"  -1/({x0}) = ({t0}^2)/2 - {t0} + C\")\nprint(f\"  {C_lhs} = {C_rhs_term1} - {t0} + C\")\nprint(f\"  From this, we find C = {C}\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Write the particular solution with the calculated C\nprint(\"Step 2: The particular solution is obtained by substituting C back into the general solution.\")\nprint(f\"  -1/x(t) = t^2/2 - t + {C}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate x(1) by substituting t=1\nprint(f\"Step 3: Find x(1) by substituting t = {t_target} into the particular solution.\")\n# Equation: -1/x(1) = t_target^2/2 - t_target + C\nrhs_val_at_t_target = Fraction(t_target**2, 2) - Fraction(t_target) + C\nfinal_x_val = -1 / rhs_val_at_t_target\n\nprint(f\"  -1/x({t_target}) = ({t_target}^2)/2 - {t_target} + {C}\")\nprint(f\"  -1/x({t_target}) = {Fraction(t_target**2, 2)} - {t_target} + {C}\")\nprint(f\"  -1/x({t_target}) = {rhs_val_at_t_target}\")\nprint(f\"Solving for x({t_target}):\")\nprint(f\"  x({t_target}) = {final_x_val}\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"The final answer is x(1) = {final_x_val}.\")\n\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
