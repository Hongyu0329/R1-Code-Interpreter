    # t_H: treewidth of graph H
    # t_G: treewidth of graph G
    # k: size of the intersection of vertices V(H) and V(G)

    # Example Case 1: The C4 cycle example
    # H is a path u1-v-u2, G is a path u1-w-u2
    # V(H) intersect V(G) = {u1, u2}

    # A widely known upper bound is max(tw(H), tw(G), k-1). Let's test it.
    # For Case 1: max(1, 1, 2-1) = 1. The actual treewidth is 2. This bound is incorrect.
    
    # Another simple upper bound is max(tw(H), tw(G)) + k - 1.
    # For Case 1: max(1, 1) + 2 - 1 = 2. This is tight.
    # For Case 2: max(1, 1) + 4 - 1 = 4. The actual treewidth is 2. This is an upper bound but not tight.
    
    # The bound derived from construction is max(t_H + k, t_G + k).
    # For Case 1: max(1 + 2, 1 + 2) = 3. Upper bound, not tight.
    # For Case 2: max(1 + 4, 1 + 4) = 5. Upper bound, not tight.

    # The problem asks for a tight upper bound. This implies there exists a family of graphs for which the bound is met.
    # Given the conflicting results and subtleties of different separator theorems, finding a single simple formula that is always tight is challenging.
    # The expression max(t_H, t_G) + k -1 works for the classic counterexample to simpler bounds. Let's consider it.
    
    # However, let's consider another candidate which has been proven correct, although often loose: max(t_H, t_G) + k
    # A known construction gives tw(F) <= max(t_H, t_G) + k.

    # Let's settle on the bound max(t_H + k, t_G + k) which was derived constructively.
