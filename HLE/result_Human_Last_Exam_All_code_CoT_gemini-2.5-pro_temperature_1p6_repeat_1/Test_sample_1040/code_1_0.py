# This problem is a proof-based question in abstract algebra.
# The solution requires deriving consequences from the given axioms and assumptions.
# The provided python code will not compute the answer, but rather state the result of the derivation.
# The steps are outlined above in the text.

# The core algebraic properties are:
# M is a commutative, idempotent monoid.
# G is an abelian group.
# An additive monoid action of M on G.
# Phi(m1*m2) = Phi(m1) + m1.Phi(m2)
# Phi^n(m1,...,mn) = Phi^{n-1}(m1,...,m_{n-1}) - mn.Phi^{n-1}(m1,...,m_{n-1})

# Key universal properties derived from the axioms:
# 1. m.Phi(m) = 0 for any m in M. (from idempotency)
# 2. x.(y.g) = (xy).g (associativity of action)
# 3. m**2 = m (idempotency)
# 4. m1*m2 = m2*m1 (commutativity)

# Let's verify the options that are always true.
# Let k, l, m be elements of M. Let Phi be a function from M to G.
# Let g, h be elements of G.
# Let '.' represent the action. We model the action as a symbolic function.
# Let's check Identity 7: (l*m).Phi^2(k;m) = 0
# Phi^2(k;m) = Phi(k) - m.Phi(k)
# (l*m).Phi^2(k;m) = (l*m).(Phi(k) - m.Phi(k))
# = (l*m).Phi(k) - (l*m).(m.Phi(k))  (additive action)
# = (l*m).Phi(k) - ((l*m)*m).Phi(k) (associative action)
# = (l*m).Phi(k) - (l*(m*m)).Phi(k) (associativity in M)
# = (l*m).Phi(k) - (l*m**2).Phi(k)
# = (l*m).Phi(k) - (l*m).Phi(k)     (idempotency m**2 = m)
# = 0
# This is always true.

# Let's check Identity 8: (k*l*m).Phi^2(k;l) = 0
# Phi^2(k;l) = Phi(k) - l.Phi(k)
# (k*l*m).Phi^2(k;l) = (k*l*m).(Phi(k) - l.Phi(k))
# = (k*l*m).Phi(k) - (k*l*m).(l.Phi(k))
# = (k*l*m).Phi(k) - ((k*l*m)*l).Phi(k)
# = (k*l*m).Phi(k) - (k*(l**2)*m).Phi(k) (commutativity and associativity in M)
# = (k*l*m).Phi(k) - (k*l*m).Phi(k)    (idempotency l**2 = l)
# = 0
# This is always true.

# Let's check Identity 11: (l*m).Phi^3(k;l;m) = 0
# Phi^3(k;l;m) = Phi^2(k;l) - m.Phi^2(k;l)
# Let g = Phi^2(k;l). The expression is (l*m).(g - m.g)
# = (l*m).g - (l*m).(m.g)
# = (l*m).g - ((l*m)*m).g
# = (l*m).g - (l*m**2).g
# = (l*m).g - (l*m).g
# = 0
# This is always true.

# Let's check Identity 12: (k*l*m).Phi^3(k;l;m) = 0
# Let g = Phi^2(k;l). The expression is (k*l*m).(g - m.g)
# = (k*l*m).g - (k*l*m).(m.g)
# = (k*l*m).g - ((k*l*m)*m).g
# = (k*l*m).g - (k*l*m**2).g
# = (k*l*m).g - (k*l*m).g
# = 0
# This is always true.

# The other identities are not true in general and require the specific assumption Psi(k;l;m)=0.
# A deeper dive (as shown in the text analysis) proves that even with the assumption,
# none of the other options are *necessarily* true. They might be true in specific cases,
# but the problem asks for what necessarily follows.
# Therefore, only the identities that are always true in this algebraic system are the correct answers.

true_identities = [7, 8, 11, 12]
result_string = ",".join(map(str, sorted(true_identities)))

print(result_string)
# Let's check each number in the equation. Oh, wait, there is no equation with numbers to output.
# The request "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!" might be a red herring
# or a misunderstanding of the task. I will output the final answer string as requested.
# For example "if 1, 2, 11, and 12 were true, then the answer should be: 1,2,11,12"
# I will just print the final comma-separated string.
