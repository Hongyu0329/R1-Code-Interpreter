# This script prints the answers to the nine questions based on the reasoning above.
# The answers are provided as a comma-separated list.

# (1) The cohomological dimension of H
# H has torsion, so cd(H) is infinite.
answer1 = '∞'

# (2) The cohomological dimension of G
# G has torsion, so cd(G) is infinite.
answer2 = '∞'

# (3) The virtual cohomological dimension of H
# H contains an index 2 subgroup isomorphic to Z, and cd(Z) = 1.
answer3 = 1

# (4) The virtual cohomological dimension of G
# G contains a finite-index torsion-free subgroup which is a free group, and cd of a free group is 1.
answer4 = 1

# (5) The number of ends of H
# H has a finite-index subgroup isomorphic to Z, which means it has 2 ends.
answer5 = 2

# (6) The number of ends of G
# G is a free product of two infinite groups, so it has infinitely many ends.
answer6 = '∞'

# (7) The cohomological dimension of P
# The pro-p completion P is the trivial group, which has cd = 0.
answer7 = 0

# (8) The virtual cohomological dimension of P
# Since P is the trivial group, its vcd is also 0.
answer8 = 0

# (9) The dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G,F_p)
# This dimension is dim(Hom((C_2)^4, F_p)). Since p is odd, this is the dimension of the zero vector space.
answer9 = 0
