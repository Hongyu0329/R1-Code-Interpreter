The structure of X is a tautomer of a dihydroxycyclopentanetrione, specifically 2,4,5-trihydroxycyclopentane-1,3-dione, which exists in its stable enol form as shown: 4,5-dihydroxy-2-hydroxy-3-oxocyclopent-1-en-1-olate. For simplicity, the most representative structure that accounts for the properties is 4,5-dihydroxy-3-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-one, with the final answer being represented by the C5H6O5 tautomeric system having a cyclopentene skeleton with multiple hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. A representative tautomer is 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydroxy-cyclopent-2-enone.
