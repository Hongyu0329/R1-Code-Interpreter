# The Jorge-Meeks formula for the Morse index (Ind) of a complete minimal surface is:
# Ind = 2d + e - 1
# where d is the degree of the Gauss map and e is the number of ends.

# 1. Determine the degree of the Gauss map (d).
# The Gauss map is g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
# The degree of the numerator (z) is 1.
# The degree of the denominator (z^3 + 2) is 3.
# The degree of the map is the maximum of these two degrees.
d = max(1, 3)
print(f"The degree of the Gauss map is d = {d}")

# 2. Determine the number of ends (e).
# The number of ends is the number of poles of the Gauss map.
# The poles are the roots of the denominator: z^3 + 2 = 0.
# This is a cubic equation, which has 3 roots in the complex plane.
e = 3
print(f"The number of ends is e = {e}")

# 3. Calculate the Morse index (Ind) using the formula.
Ind = 2 * d + e - 1

# 4. Print the final calculation.
