# The problem asks for the 50th segmented number.
# As determined in the plan, the sequence of segmented numbers consists of powers of 2.
# The n-th segmented number is given by the formula 2^(n-1).

# For this problem, we need to find the 50th element.
n = 50

# Calculate the exponent for the n-th term.
exponent = n - 1
base = 2

# Compute the final result.
result = base ** exponent

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The final equation is 2^49 = result.
