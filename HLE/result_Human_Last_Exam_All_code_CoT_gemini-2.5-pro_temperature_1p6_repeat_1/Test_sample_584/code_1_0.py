# Given parameters
r = 3
b = 9
# Target probability (false positive rate)
p_target = 0.05

# We need to solve the equation: p_target = 1 - (1 - s^r)^b
# Rearranging the formula to solve for s:
# (1 - s^r)^b = 1 - p_target
# 1 - s^r = (1 - p_target)^(1/b)
# s^r = 1 - (1 - p_target)^(1/b)
# s = (1 - (1 - p_target)^(1/b))^(1/r)

s = (1 - (1 - p_target)**(1/b))**(1/r)

# Print the explanation and the equation
