    print("B: Incorrect. The data shows A and B, not A and C, deactivate the product of 'xy'.")
    
    # C. Virulence factor A and virulence factor C deactivate the product of gene xy. Virulence factor C does not influence the infection process.
    print("C: Incorrect. It's A and B that target the 'xy' pathway, and C clearly influences the infection (e.g., wtL + ΔC is 3000 vs wtL + wt at 5000).")

    print("E: Incorrect. C's effect is independent of 'xy'. A and B deactivate the 'xy' product.")
