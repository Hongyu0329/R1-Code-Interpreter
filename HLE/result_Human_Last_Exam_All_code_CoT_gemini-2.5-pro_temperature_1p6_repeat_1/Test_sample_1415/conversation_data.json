    "The user wants me to evaluate a definite integral and find the closest integer to 10000 times its value.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integral is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1. The integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The integral evaluates to `[ln(F₃(x))]` from 0 to 1, which is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(1)**:\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n4.  **Calculate F₃(0)**:\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n5.  **Compute the Value (V)**: `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`. I will use Python's `math` library for the numerical calculation.\n6.  **Final Result**: Calculate `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer.\n\nThe python code will perform steps 3-6 and print out the required values and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef F0(x):\n  return x\n\ndef F1(x):\n  return math.sin(F0(x))\n\ndef F2(x):\n  return math.exp(F1(x))\n\ndef F3(x):\n  return math.log(1 + F2(x))\n\n# The integral of F3'(x)/F3(x) is ln(F3(x)).\n# By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n# V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\n\n# Calculate F3(1) and F3(0)\nf3_at_1 = F3(1)\nf3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n# The integral equation with the calculated numbers\nprint(f\"The integral V is ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\")\nprint(f\"F3(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F3(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(f\"So, the equation is: ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0})\")\n\n\n# Calculate the value of V\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n# Note: This can also be calculated as math.log(f3_at_1 / f3_at_0)\n\n# Calculate the final result\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe value of the integral V is: {V}\")\nprint(f\"The value of 10000 * V is: {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000*V is: {closest_integer}\")\n```\n<<<5489>>>"
