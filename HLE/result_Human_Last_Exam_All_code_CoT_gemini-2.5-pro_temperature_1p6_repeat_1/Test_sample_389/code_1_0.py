    print("Step 2: How modulation works in a Taqsim")
    print("In an improvisational taqsim, a performer explores the main maqam and often modulates.")
    print("Common modulations include moving to a new jins on a different scale degree or altering a note in the original jins to change its character.\n")

    # 3. Evaluate the options
    print("Step 3: Evaluating the answer choices")
    print("Most of the options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) introduce tonal centers and accidentals that are very distant from the Bayati scale on D, making them highly unusual modulations.")
    print("For example, Jins Nahawand on E (E-F#-G-A) or Jins Rast on Eb (Eb-F-G\u266D-Ab) would be jarring and are not standard practice.\n")

    print("As you can see, the transition only requires lowering one note, the G, to a Gb.")
    print("This subtle shift is a classic expressive technique in a Bayati taqsim. It allows the performer to introduce the intense, dramatic color of Saba without leaving the tonic of D.")
    print("This is a much more common and integrated modulation than moving to a completely different jins on a different note.\n")
