# Let's analyze the path from one end of the line segment (A) to the other (B).
# The line segment intersects the circle at two points, let's call them P1 and P2.
# Any path from A to B must proceed sequentially through these points.

# Stage 1: Path from the start point (A) to the first intersection point (P1).
# There is only one direct route: along the line segment itself.
paths_A_to_P1 = 1

# Stage 2: Path from the first intersection (P1) to the second intersection (P2).
# Here, we have three distinct choices:
# 1. The path along the line segment (the chord of the circle).
# 2. The path along the major arc of the circle.
# 3. The path along the minor arc of the circle.
paths_P1_to_P2 = 3

# Stage 3: Path from the second intersection point (P2) to the end point (B).
# There is only one direct route: along the rest of the line segment.
paths_P2_to_B = 1

# To find the total number of distinct paths, we multiply the number of choices at each stage.
total_paths = paths_A_to_P1 * paths_P1_to_P2 * paths_P2_to_B
