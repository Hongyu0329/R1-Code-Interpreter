    This function calculates the value [X] for the space X = [0,1]^3.

    The problem asks for the value [X], which is the minimum n for which the space X
    is n-compact. A space is n-compact if it has an open sub-basis such that every
    cover by elements of that sub-basis has a subcover with n or fewer elements.

    For a non-empty compact metric space X, a theorem in dimension theory states that
    [X] is equal to its Lebesgue covering dimension plus one.
    The formula is: [X] = dim(X) + 1.

    The space X = [0,1]^3 is the unit cube in 3 dimensions. It is a non-empty
    compact metric space.
    The Lebesgue covering dimension of the k-cube, [0,1]^k, is k.
    Therefore, for X = [0,1]^3, the dimension is 3.
