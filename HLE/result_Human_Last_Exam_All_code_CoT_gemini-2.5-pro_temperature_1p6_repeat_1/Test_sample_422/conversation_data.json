    "My plan is to first analyze the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge and its components. Then, I will identify two well-known philosophical problems with this definition, specifically avoiding the Gettier cases as requested. The two problems I will focus on are:\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification**: This problem challenges the 'J' (Justification) component, as any justification can itself be questioned, leading to an endless need for further justifications.\n2.  **The Problem with the Belief Condition**: This problem challenges the 'B' (Belief) component, using examples where someone may be considered to have knowledge without holding a conscious, confident belief.\n\nI will then write a Python script to present and explain these two issues. The script will simply use `print` statements to outline each problem clearly, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two non-Gettier problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB)\n    definition of knowledge.\n    \"\"\"\n    jtb_definition = \"Knowledge = Justified (J) + True (T) + Belief (B)\"\n    epistemic_states = \"Knowledge, Belief\"\n\n    print(f\"Given the JTB definition: '{jtb_definition}'\")\n    print(f\"And that our only available epistemic states are: '{epistemic_states}'\")\n    print(\"Ignoring Gettier problems, JTB runs into the following two issues:\\n\")\n\n    # --- Problem 1: The Nature of Justification ---\n    print(\"--- 1.
