    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the two Nobel laureates who appeared in the 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial based on my knowledge base. Then, I will write a simple Python script to declare their names as variables and print them in a complete sentence to answer your question directly.\n\n```python\n# The two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n# Paul Krugman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.\n# Merton Miller won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990.\n\nlaureate_1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\nlaureate_2 = \"Merton Miller\"\n\nprint(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline 'Ask Why' were {laureate_1} and {laureate_2}.\")\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
