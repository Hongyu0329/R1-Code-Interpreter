    print("This creates strong selective pressure for individual plants to evolve more complex VOC bouquets.")

    print("In these same high-pressure regions (low latitudes), there is an advantage for plants to be chemically different from their neighbors.")
    print("If individuals in a population vary their chemical defenses (high β-diversity), it is harder for a specialized parasite or herbivore to spread through the community.")
    print("This 'chemical distinctiveness' is a powerful community-level defense mechanism, so selection for it is strong in the tropics.")
    print("Therefore, β-diversity is also expected to be highest at the equator and decrease with increasing latitude.")
