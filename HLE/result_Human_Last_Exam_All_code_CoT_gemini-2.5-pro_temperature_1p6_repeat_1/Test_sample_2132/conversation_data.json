    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:** The reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n2.  **Determine the Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of a cyclic alpha-halo ketone results in a ring contraction. 2-chlorocyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring) will rearrange to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (a 5-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group).\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:** The product, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, has the chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₂.\n4.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMCI):** The formula is `BMCI = (N_atoms * N_bonds) / N_parts`.\n5.  **Calculate the Components of the Formula:**\n    *   `N_atoms`: The total number of atoms in the molecule. From C₆H₁₀O₂, this is 6 (Carbon) + 10 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = 18.\n    *   `N_parts`: The number of non-hydrogen atoms. This is 6 (Carbon) + 2 (Oxygen) = 8.\n    *   `N_bonds`: The total number of connections between atoms. For the BMCI, multiple bonds (like a C=O double bond) are counted as a single connection. For a single molecule containing one ring, the number of bonds is equal to the number of atoms. Therefore, `N_bonds` = 18.\n6.  **Calculate the BMCI:** Substitute the values into the formula: `(18 * 18) / 8`.\n7.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result in the requested format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\n# The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n# The chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\n# The Böttcher Molecular Complexity is calculated as: (N_atoms * N_bonds) / N_parts\n\n# 1. N_atoms: Total number of atoms in the molecule.\n# For C6H10O2, N_atoms = 6 (C) + 10 (H) + 2 (O) = 18\nn_atoms = 18\n\n# 2. N_parts: Total number of non-hydrogen atoms.\n# N_parts = 6 (C) + 2 (O) = 8\nn_parts = 8\n\n# 3. N_bonds: Total number of atomic connections (multiple bonds count as 1).\n# For a single molecule with one ring, N_bonds = N_atoms.\n# So, N_bonds = 18\nn_bonds = 18\n\n# Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity Index (BMCI)\nbmci = (n_atoms * n_bonds) / n_parts\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\nprint(f\"The Böttcher Molecular Complexity is calculated as: (N_atoms * N_bonds) / N_parts\")\nprint(f\"For cyclopentanecarboxylic acid:\")\nprint(f\"({n_atoms} * {n_bonds}) / {n_parts} = {bmci}\")\n\n```\n<<<40.5>>>"
