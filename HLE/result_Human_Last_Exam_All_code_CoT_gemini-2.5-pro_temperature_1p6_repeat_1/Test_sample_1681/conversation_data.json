    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Quantum Game Setup:** We'll use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a standard framework for quantizing 2-player, 2-strategy games.\n2.  **Define Initial State:** The problem states that we can design the initial state for an optimal outcome. In the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the optimal setup involves a maximally entangled initial state. This state is created by applying an entangling operator, `J`, to the classical starting state `|Cooperate, Cooperate>`.\n3.  **Define Player Strategies:** In the quantum version, players' strategies are no longer just \"Cooperate\" (C) or \"Defect\" (D), but unitary operators applied to their respective qubits. The classical strategies C and D have quantum equivalents, but a new, powerful \"Quantum\" strategy, denoted as `Q`, emerges.\n4.  **Identify the Equilibrium:** For a maximally entangled game, the classical Nash Equilibrium (Defect, Defect) is no longer an equilibrium. A new, unique Nash Equilibrium appears: `(Q, Q)`. This strategy profile is also Pareto optimal, meaning no other outcome can make at least one player better off without making the other worse off. This new equilibrium resolves the dilemma, as both players choosing `Q` leads to a mutually beneficial outcome equivalent to cooperation.\n5.  **Calculate the Payoff:** The main task is to calculate the expected payoff for the equilibrium strategy `(Q, Q)`. This involves the following steps:\n    *   Start with the initial state `|ψ₀> = |CC>`.\n    *   Apply the entangling operator `J`: `|ψ_in> = J|ψ₀>`.\n    *   Apply the players' strategies `(Q ⊗ Q)`: `|ψ'> = (Q ⊗ Q)|ψ_in>`.\n    *   Apply the disentangling operator `J†` (the conjugate transpose of J): `|ψ_f> = J†|ψ'>`.\n    *   Measure the final state `|ψ_f>` in the classical basis `{|CC>, |CD>, |DC>, |DD>}` to find the probability of each outcome.\n    *   Calculate the expected payoff for each player using these probabilities and the given payoff matrix.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation step-by-step using `numpy` for complex matrix operations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point payoff for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
