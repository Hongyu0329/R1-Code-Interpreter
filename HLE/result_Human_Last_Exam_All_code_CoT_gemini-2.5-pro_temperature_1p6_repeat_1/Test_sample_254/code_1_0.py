Statistical consistency can occur by chance even when the transitivity assumption is violated. Validity requires both clinical plausibility (transitivity) and statistical agreement (consistency).")

It requires the logical underpinning of transitivity, which is then checked with the statistical test of consistency, while also appropriately accounting for heterogeneity.
