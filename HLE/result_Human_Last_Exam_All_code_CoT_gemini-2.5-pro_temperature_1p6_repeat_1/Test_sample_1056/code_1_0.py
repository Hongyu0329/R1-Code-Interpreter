    # Let tau be the golden ratio conjugate. The properties of tau are central.
    # tau = (sqrt(5) - 1) / 2
    # It satisfies the equation tau^2 + tau - 1 = 0.
    
    # Step 1: Identify the group G.
    # The group G is the subgroup of Homeo_+[0, 1] with:
    # - Piecewise linear functions with a finite number of pieces.
    # - Breakpoints (x-coordinates where the slope changes) in the ring Z[tau].
    # - Slopes of the linear pieces are in the set tau^Z = {..., tau^-2, tau^-1, 1, tau, tau^2, ...}.
    # This group is known in mathematics as the golden ratio Thompson's group, denoted F(tau).
    print("Step 1: The group G is identified as the Thompson-like group F(tau).")
    
    # Step 2: Understand the goal.
    # We need to compute the rank 'r' and the order of the torsion subgroup 't'
    # of the abelianization of G, Ab(G) = G/[G,G].
    # By the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, Ab(G) is isomorphic
    # to Z^r x T, where r is the rank and T is the torsion subgroup of order t.
    print("Step 2: We aim to find the structure of Ab(G) to determine its rank (r) and torsion order (t).")

    # Step 3: Apply the relevant mathematical theorem.
    # The structure of Ab(F(tau)) is a known result. While some literature has conflicting reports,
    # a recent comprehensive theorem from Cleary, Witzel, and Zaremsky (2022) applies directly.
    # Their theorem computes the abelianization for a class of Higman-Thompson groups V_2(R, U).
    # For our group G, the ring of breakpoints is R = Z[tau]. This is the ring of integers of
    # the quadratic field Q(sqrt(5)). Z[tau] is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), and thus a Dedekind domain.
    # The Picard group of a PID is trivial, so Pic(R) = {0}.
    # The group of slopes is U = tau^Z, which is isomorphic to the additive group Z.
    
    # The theorem states: Ab(V_2(R, U)) is isomorphic to U x U x (Pic(R) tensor_Z U).
    # Plugging in our R and U:
    # Ab(G) ~= (tau^Z) x (tau^Z) x ({0} tensor_Z tau^Z)
    # Since the tensor product with the trivial group is trivial, the third term vanishes.
    # Ab(G) ~= tau^Z x tau^Z
    # The group tau^Z is isomorphic to Z (via the map tau^k -> k).
    # Therefore, Ab(G) is isomorphic to Z x Z, which is Z^2.
    print("Step 3: Applying a theorem from Cleary, Witzel, and Zaremsky (2022), we find Ab(G) is isomorphic to Z^2.")

    # Step 4: Determine r and t from the structure of Ab(G).
    # The abelianization is Ab(G) ~= Z^2.
    # The rank 'r' is the number of Z factors in the free part of the group.
    # For Z^2, the rank is 2.
    r = 2
    
    # The torsion subgroup T of Z^2 consists of elements of finite order.
    # The only element of finite order in Z^2 is the identity element (0, 0).
    # So, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group {0}.
    # The order 't' of the torsion subgroup is its size, which is 1.
    t = 1
    
    print(f"Step 4: From the structure Ab(G) ~= Z^2, the rank is r = {r}.")
    print(f"The torsion subgroup of Z^2 is trivial, so its order is t = {t}.")
    
    # Step 5: Final Answer
    # The computed pair is (r, t).
