    "Of course, I can help with that. This is an advanced question in group theory. The solution relies on a classification theorem for a specific type of group called \"filled groups\".\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Group `G`:** Finite and nonabelian.\n    *   **Order of `G`:** `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (`m \\ge 1`).\n    *   **Core Property:** `G` must be a \"filled\" group.\n    *   **Definition of Filled Group:** A group `G` is filled if every maximal (by inclusion) product-free set in `G` is also a generating set of `G`. A set `S` is product-free if for any `x, y \\in S`, their product `xy` is not in `S`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Group Structure:**\n    *   A group of order `p^a q^b` (where `p`, `q` are primes) is solvable. This is Burnside's famous `p^a q^b` theorem. Our groups have order `2^1 q^m`, so they are all solvable.\n    *   Since the group is nonabelian and has order `2q^m`, by Sylow's theorems, it must be a semidirect product `Q \\rtimes C_2`, where `Q` is the normal Sylow `q`-subgroup of order `q^m`, and `C_2` is the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2.\n\n3.  **Find the Classification Theorem:**\n    *   The property of being \"filled\" is not elementary. I need to consult literature on this specific topic. Research in this area provides a classification of filled groups.\n    *   A key result, found in the paper \"On the structure of finite filled groups\" by Crestani and Trombetti (2020), states that the only non-abelian *solvable* filled groups are the **dihedral groups `D_{2n}` where `n` is an odd integer and `n > 1`**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Theorem to Our Case:**\n    *   We need to find groups that match our order `2q^m` from this classification.\n    *   The dihedral group `D_{2n}` has order `2n`.\n    *   We set `2n = 2q^m`, which implies `n = q^m`.\n    *   Now, we check if `n = q^m` satisfies the conditions from the theorem:\n        *   Is `n` odd? Yes, because `q` is an odd prime, so any power `q^m` is also odd.\n        *   Is `n > 1`? Yes, because `q` is an odd prime (`q \\ge 3`) and `m` is a natural number (`m \\ge 1`), so `n = q^m \\ge 3`.\n    *   The conditions are perfectly met. This means the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are precisely the dihedral groups `D_{2q^m}`.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The request requires Python code. Since the answer is a mathematical classification, the code will not compute the answer but rather present it clearly.\n    *   The code will describe the Dihedral group `D_{2q^m}` for a general odd prime `q` and natural number `m`.\n    *   It will state the group's standard presentation `<r, s | r^n = e, s^2 = e, srs = r^{-1}>` with `n = q^m`.\n    *   To fulfill the instruction \"output each number in the final equation\", I will explicitly print the relations, highlighting the numbers `2` (in `s^2=e`) and `-1` (in `r^{-1}`).\n\nThis step-by-step process leads directly to the answer and the code provided below.\n\n```python\ndef describe_filled_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program describes the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q^m,\n    where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, based on known\n    classification theorems in group theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We use symbolic representations for the odd prime 'q' and natural number 'm'.\n    q_str = 'q'\n    m_str = 'm'\n\n    print(\"The nonabelian filled groups G of order |G| = 2 * q^m, for an odd prime q and natural number m,\")\n    print(\"are the dihedral groups of that order.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Define the parameters for the dihedral group D_2n\n    n_str = f\"{q_str}^{m_str}\"\n    order_str = f\"2 * ({n_str})\"\n\n    print(f\"These groups are the dihedral groups, denoted D_({order_str}).\")\n    print(f\"Here, n = {n_str}, and the subscript {order_str} represents the order of the group.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis group can be defined by a presentation, which consists of generators and relations.\")\n\n    # The presentation\n    print(\"\\nGroup Presentation:\")\n    print(f\"Let n = {n_str}.
