# The final sequence is determined by solving the logic puzzle.
# Let's assign each number its place in the final sequence.

# "Number 1 is the first to have something" -> Position 1
pos1 = 1
# "Number 4 likes two the most and it always goes behind." -> The block (2, 4) comes next
pos2 = 2
pos3 = 4
# "Number three ... protects the last" -> Position 4, right before the last number.
pos4 = 3
# "the fifth, who never had a thing and lastly follows." -> Position 5
pos5 = 0

# The riddle uses the word "equation", but the hint clarifies it is a sequence.
# We will print the numbers in the correct order.
print(f"The correct order is: {pos1}, {pos2}, {pos3}, {pos4}, {pos5}")
