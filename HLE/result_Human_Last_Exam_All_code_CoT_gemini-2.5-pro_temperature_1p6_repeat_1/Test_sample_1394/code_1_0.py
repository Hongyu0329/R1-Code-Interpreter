# The two families of solutions derived from the factored differential equations are:
# 1. From y(x - dy/dx) - 3x = 0 which is y*dy/dx = x(y-3)
#    Integration of y/(y-3) dy = x dx gives y + 3*ln|y-3| = x^2/2 + C
#    Multiplying by 2 gives: 2*y + 6*ln|y-3| = x^2 + C'
#    Which can be written as: 2*y + 6*ln|y-3| - x^2 = C
#
# 2. From y(x + dy/dx) + 3x = 0 which is y*dy/dx = -x(y+3)
#    Integration of y/(y+3) dy = -x dx gives y - 3*ln|y+3| = -x^2/2 + C
#    Multiplying by 2 gives: 2*y - 6*ln|y+3| = -x^2 + C''
