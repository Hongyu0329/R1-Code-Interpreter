    # The problem asks to identify two subsets of the rational numbers, let's call them A and B,
    # that are equivalent under the specified relation. We choose non-homeomorphic sets
    # to illustrate that the relation is different from homeomorphism.

Map the isolated points {2, 3} from B to two distinct rational points in A (e.g., 1/2 and 1/3). The remainder of B (which is A itself) can be mapped homeomorphically into the remainder of A (i.e., A \\ {1/2, 1/3}). This is possible because A \\ {1/2, 1/3} is, like A, a countable metric space with no isolated points, and by Sierpinski's theorem, both are homeomorphic to the rational numbers.\n")

    # --- Part 2: How many equivalence classes? ---
    # To answer this, we classify all subsets of the rationals into two types.
    
    # Type 1: Non-scattered subsets. These are subsets that contain a "perfect kernel", a subset that is dense-in-itself. For any subset of the rationals, if this kernel is not empty, it is homeomorphic to Q itself.
    # All such non-scattered subsets are equivalent to Q under our relation, forming a single equivalence class.
    
    # Type 2: Scattered subsets. These do not contain any subset homeomorphic to Q. This category includes finite sets, discrete infinite sets, convergent sequences, and more complex arrangements. These spaces give rise to many distinct equivalence classes.
