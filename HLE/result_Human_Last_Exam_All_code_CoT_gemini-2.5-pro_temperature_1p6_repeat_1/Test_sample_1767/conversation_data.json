    "The problem asks for the Chern number of a junction formed by two Chern insulators. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Individual Chern Numbers**: We are given two Chern insulators. The first has a Chern number C1 = 1, and the second has a Chern number C2 = 1.\n2.  **Apply the Additivity Principle**: The Chern number is a topological invariant. For a system composed of multiple non-interacting or weakly-interacting subsystems (like two insulators connected laterally with a negligible barrier), the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual subsystems.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Chern Number**: The total Chern number of the junction, C_total, is the sum of the individual Chern numbers: C_total = C1 + C2.\n4.  **Code the Solution**: The Python script will define the individual Chern numbers, calculate their sum, and print the final equation demonstrating the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is an additive topological quantum number.\n# When two systems are combined, the Chern number of the resulting system is the\n# sum of the individual Chern numbers, provided they are weakly coupled.\n\n# Chern number of the first insulator\nC1 = 1\n\n# Chern number of the second insulator\nC2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the Chern number of the junction\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the final result as an equation\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2 = {C1} + {C2} = {C_total}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
