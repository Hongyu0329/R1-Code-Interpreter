    This function prints the derived exact value of l_k(n) in terms of n and k.
    The derivation follows the plan outlined above, which involves:
    1. Simplifying the expression for l_k(n).
    2. Calculating the determinant of Σ.
    3. Finding the specific coordinate vector c by tracing the sampling process backwards.
    4. Calculating the quadratic form c^T * Σ^(-1) * c.
    5. Combining these results to obtain the final formula.
