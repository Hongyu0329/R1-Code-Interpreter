    "Of course. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the specific atom. I will explain how to calculate this for a hydrogen atom and a \"heavy\" atom (like carbon) and provide a Python script that demonstrates this calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name:** I will first break down the `6-311G**` notation into its components (core, valence, and polarization functions).\n2.  **Calculate for Hydrogen:** I will apply the rules to a hydrogen atom. Hydrogen is unique as it has no core electrons.\n3.  **Calculate for a Heavy Atom:** I will apply the rules to a second-row heavy atom (e.g., Carbon). These atoms have both core and valence electrons.\n4.  **Python Script:** I will provide a Python script that automates these calculations for both Hydrogen and Carbon, printing the breakdown and the final sum in an equation format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n*   **`6-311G`**: This is a Pople-style split-valence basis set.\n    *   **`6-`**: The core orbitals of heavy atoms are described by one contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **`-311`**: Each valence orbital is described by three functions. The first is a contraction of **3** primitives, the second is **1** primitive, and the third is **1** primitive.\n*   **`**`**: These are polarization functions.\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of **d-type** primitive functions (6 functions in total) to each heavy atom.\n    *   The second `*` adds one set of **p-type** primitive functions (3 functions in total) to each hydrogen atom.\n\nWith these rules, we can calculate the total number of primitives.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_6_311g_star_star_primitives():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G**\n    basis set for Hydrogen and a representative heavy atom (Carbon).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Calculation for Hydrogen (H) ---\n    print(\"Calculating for Hydrogen (H):\")\n    # H has one valence orbital (1s) and no core electrons.\n    # The '311' part applies to the valence 1s orbital.\n    s_primitives_h = 3 + 1 + 1\n    # The second '*' in 'G**' adds a set of p-functions to H.\n    # A set of p-functions has 3 primitives (px, py, pz).\n    p_primitives_h = 3\n    total_h = s_primitives_h + p_primitives_h\n\n    print(\"H has no core electrons.\")\n    print(f\"Valence 1s primitives (311G): {s_primitives_h}\")\n    print(f\"Polarization p-primitives (**): {p_primitives_h}\")\n    print(\"Total primitive Gaussians for H:\")\n    print(f\"{s_primitives_h} (s) + {p_primitives_h} (p) = {total_h}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Calculation for a second-row heavy atom (e.g., Carbon, C) ---\n    print(\"Calculating for a second-row heavy atom (e.g., Carbon, C):\")\n    # The '6-' part describes the core 1s orbital.\n    core_primitives = 6\n    # The '311' part applies to the valence orbitals (2s and 2p for Carbon).\n    # For the 2s orbital:\n    s_primitives_c = 3 + 1 + 1\n    # For the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz), each is split into 3,1,1\n    p_primitives_c = 3 * (3 + 1 + 1)\n    # The first '*' in 'G**' adds a set of d-functions to heavy atoms.\n    # A set of Cartesian d-functions has 6 primitives.\n    d_primitives_c = 6\n    total_c = core_primitives + s_primitives_c + p_primitives_c + d_primitives_c\n\n    print(f\"Core 1s primitives (6-): {core_primitives}\")\n    print(f\"Valence 2s primitives (311G): {s_primitives_c}\")\n    print(f\"Valence 2p primitives (311G): {p_primitives_c}\")\n    print(f\"Polarization d-primitives (*): {d_primitives_c}\")\n    print(\"Total primitive Gaussians for C:\")\n    print(f\"{core_primitives} (core) + {s_primitives_c} (valence s) + {p_primitives_c} (valence p) + {d_primitives_c} (d) = {total_c}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_6_311g_star_star_primitives()\n\n```\n<<<A Hydrogen atom has 8 primitive Gaussians.
