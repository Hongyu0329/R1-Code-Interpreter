    # 1. Describe Polysaccharides
    print("\n1. Polysaccharide Structure:")
    print("   - Monomers: Simple sugars (monosaccharides), like glucose.")
    print("   - Backbone: A chain composed solely of sugar units.")
    print("   - Bonds: The monomers are linked by 'glycosidic bonds'.")
    print("   - Examples: Starch, cellulose, glycogen.")

    # 2. Describe Polynucleotides
    print("\n2. Polynucleotide Structure:")
    print("   - Monomers: Nucleotides.")
    print("   - Nucleotide Composition: A nucleotide itself is complex, made of three parts:")
    print("     a) A five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA).")
    print("     b) A phosphate group.")
    print("     c) A nitrogenous base (e.g., Adenine, Guanine).")
    print("   - Backbone: A repeating 'sugar-phosphate' backbone.")
    print("   - Bonds: The nucleotide monomers are linked by 'phosphodiester bonds'.")
    print("   - Examples: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid).")

    # 3. Compare and highlight key differences
    print("\n3. Key Structural Differences:")
    print("   - Monomer Complexity: A polysaccharide monomer is a simple sugar. A polynucleotide monomer (nucleotide) is much more complex, containing a sugar, a phosphate, and a base.")
    print("   - Backbone Composition: The backbone of a polysaccharide is made of sugars. The backbone of a polynucleotide is made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups.")
    print("   - Linking Bonds: Polysaccharides use glycosidic bonds. Polynucleotides use phosphodiester bonds.")

    # 4. Address the "homopolynucleotide" question
    print("\nRegarding Homopolynucleotides (e.g., a chain of only Adenine nucleotides):")
    print("Even a homopolynucleotide is not a polysaccharide. It is still built from nucleotide monomers and linked by phosphodiester bonds, retaining the fundamental structural features (phosphate groups, nitrogenous bases) that distinguish it from a polysaccharide.")

    # 5. Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Although both are polymers and polynucleotides do contain sugar, the presence of phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases, along with the different type of chemical bond (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic), makes them a fundamentally different class of molecule from polysaccharides.")
