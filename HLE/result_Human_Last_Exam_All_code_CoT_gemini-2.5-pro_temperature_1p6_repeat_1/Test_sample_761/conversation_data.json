    "To answer this question, I will provide a Python script that prints a detailed explanation comparing the structures of polynucleotides and polysaccharides. The script will clarify the fundamental differences between these two types of biological polymers.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a polysaccharide, focusing on its monomer units (monosaccharides) and the bonds that link them (glycosidic bonds).\n2.  Define a polynucleotide, detailing its more complex monomer units (nucleotides, which consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base) and their linking bonds (phosphodiester bonds).\n3.  Directly compare the two structures to highlight the key chemical differences, such as the presence of phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases in polynucleotides, which are absent in polysaccharides.\n4.  Conclude with a clear answer to the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef explain_structural_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints an explanation comparing the structures of polynucleotides and polysaccharides.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"Are polynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides?\"\n    answer = \"No, structurally, polynucleotides are not polysaccharides.\"\n\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Direct Answer: {answer}\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    \n    # 1.
