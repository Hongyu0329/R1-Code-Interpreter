# The goal is to determine the relationship between the concentration of
# 3-Hydroxypropionate, which we denote as [B], and PEP, denoted as [F].

# We trace the direct biochemical pathway from [B] to [F]:
# Step 1: 3-Hydroxypropionate -> Malonyl-CoA (Rate constant: k2)
# Step 2: Malonyl-CoA -> Acetyl-CoA (Rate constant: k3)
# Step 3: Acetyl-CoA -> Pyruvate (Rate constant: k4)
# Step 4: Pyruvate -> PEP (Rate constant: k5)

# The concentration of the product of a reaction is proportional to the
# concentration of the reactant multiplied by the rate constant.
# We can express the relationship as a chain of proportionalities:
# [F] ∝ [Pyruvate] * k5
# [Pyruvate] ∝ [Acetyl-CoA] * k4
# [Acetyl-CoA] ∝ [Malonyl-CoA] * k3
# [Malonyl-CoA] ∝ [B] * k2

# By substitution, we can find the overall relationship:
# [F] ∝ ([Acetyl-CoA] * k4) * k5
# [F] ∝ (([Malonyl-CoA] * k3) * k4) * k5
# [F] ∝ ((([B] * k2) * k3) * k4) * k5
# [F] ∝ [B] * k2 * k3 * k4 * k5

# The final expression shows that [F] is directly proportional to [B] and the product
# of the rate constants along the direct path (k2, k3, k4, k5).
# This corresponds to answer choice G.

# Now, we print the final equation as requested.
