# The problem is to find the probability that the number of good and defective products
# will eventually be equal. This is a classic problem in the study of Polya's Urn processes.
# The probability 'p' of reaching equality from a state (W, B) is given by the formula:
# p = 2 * min(W, B) / (W + B)

# We apply this formula to our initial state (W0, B0).
# First, find the minimum of the two initial counts.
min_W0_B0 = min(W0, B0)

# Next, find the sum of the two initial counts.
sum_W0_B0 = W0 + B0

# The numerator of the probability fraction.
numerator = 2 * min_W0_B0

# The denominator of the probability fraction.
denominator = sum_W0_B0

# Calculate the exact probability.
probability = numerator / denominator
