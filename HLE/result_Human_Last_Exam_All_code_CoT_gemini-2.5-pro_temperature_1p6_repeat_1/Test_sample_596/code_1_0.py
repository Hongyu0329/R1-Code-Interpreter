# Step 1: Identify the order of the torsion subgroup of the relevant homology group.
# The space is the real projective plane, RP^2. The dimension is n=2.
# We need the first homology group, H_1(RP^2, Z), which is Z_2.
# The torsion subgroup of H_1(RP^2, Z) is Z_2 itself.
# The order of this group is 2.
torsion_subgroup_order = 2

# Step 2: Apply the formula for the number of non-collapsing rooted forests.
# The formula is |Tors(H_{n-1}(K))|^2.
result = torsion_subgroup_order ** 2

# Step 3: Print the calculation and the final answer.
print(f"The calculation is based on the order of the torsion subgroup of the first homology group of the real projective plane.")
print(f"Order of Tors(H_1(RP^2)) = {torsion_subgroup_order}")
print(f"The number of non-collapsing rooted forests is ({torsion_subgroup_order})^2 = {result}")
