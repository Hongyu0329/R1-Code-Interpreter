    print("Step 1: Understand the Repair Process")
    print("The process is 'manual TIG welding build-up of layers'. This is an additive process used to restore material that has been lost, thereby fixing the blade's geometry.\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluate each damage type:")
    print("A. Stress Corrosion Cracking: This is a crack. Repair involves removing the crack and filling the void, but it's not primarily a 'build-up' process.")
    print("B. Foreign Object Damage: This causes nicks and gouges. Repair involves filling these voids, which is a form of build-up. This is a possible answer.")
    print("C. Blade Tip Rub and Wear: This is the direct loss of material from the blade tip due to contact with the casing. Restoring the lost tip height requires adding 'layers of filler material'. This is a perfect match for the described repair.")
    print("D. Creep Deformation: This is the stretching of the blade. Welding build-up doesn't fix the stretch itself.")
    print("E. Fatigue Cracking: Similar to stress corrosion cracking, this is primarily a crack repair.")
    print("F. High-Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion: This leads to surface thinning. While welding could be used, protective coatings are the primary countermeasure and repair method.\n")

    print("Step 3: Conclude the most likely answer.")
    print("Blade Tip Rub and Wear is a classic example of service life degradation that results in material loss at a specific location. The repair procedure is precisely to build up the tip with new material using welding to restore the correct engine clearances and performance.")
