# The problem asks for a critical exponent of a reverse square function estimate
# for the cone in R^3. The problem is from the field of harmonic analysis.

# The optimal exponent, alpha, is known to be a piecewise linear function of 1/p.
# The 'critical exponents' are the values of p where the slope of this function changes.
# These changes correspond to different geometric configurations becoming dominant.

# The problem states that one of the critical exponents is 4.
known_critical_exponent = 4

# This exponent p=4 is related to 'bilinear' interactions of wave packets.
# Research in harmonic analysis shows that the other fundamental geometric transition
# for the cone in R^3 is related to 'trilinear' or 'coplanar' interactions.
# This transition occurs at the exponent p=3.

other_critical_exponent = 3

# The two critical exponents for this problem are 4 and 3.
# The question asks for the other critical exponent, which is 3.
