    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the conditions under which a triangle $ABC$ has two possible solutions for the length of side $AB$, given the length of side $BC$ and the measure of angle $B$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to find the solution:\n1.  **Identify the geometric setup**: We are given a triangle with side $a = BC = S$ and angle $B = 30^{\\circ}$. We are looking for the number of integer values of side $b = AC$ for which there are two possible lengths for side $c = AB$.\n2.  **Apply the Ambiguous Case (SSA) of the Law of Sines**: This problem is a classic example of the \"ambiguous case\" in trigonometry. For a given Side-Side-Angle (SSA) configuration, two distinct triangles can be formed if and only if the side opposite the given angle ($AC$) is greater than the triangle's altitude from the third vertex ($C$) but less than the other given side ($BC$).\n3.  **Formulate the inequality**: Let $h$ be the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$. The length of this altitude is given by $h = BC \\cdot \\sin(B)$. For two triangles to exist, the length of $AC$ must satisfy the inequality $h < AC < BC$.\n4.  **Substitute the given values**: We are given $BC = S$ and $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$. We know that $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 0.5$. Substituting these into our inequality gives:\n    $S \\cdot 0.5 < AC < S$\n5.  **Count the integers**: The problem asks for the number of *integer* values of $AC$ that satisfy this inequality. We need to find all integers between $0.5 \\cdot S$ and $S$.\n6.  **Write the code**: The Python code will first define a value for $S$ (since $SNYWR$ is a placeholder, I will use a sample 5-digit number). It will then calculate the lower and upper bounds of the inequality, and finally count the number of integers within that range. The code will print out the final inequality with the computed bounds and the final count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_triangle_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of integer values for side AC for which there\n    are two possible values for side AB in a triangle ABC.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let S = SNYWR.
