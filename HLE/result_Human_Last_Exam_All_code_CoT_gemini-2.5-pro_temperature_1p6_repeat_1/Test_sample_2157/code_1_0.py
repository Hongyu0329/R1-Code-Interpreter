    This function solves the described matrix puzzle step-by-step.
    
    Step 1: Define the matrix M_n and find n_0.
    The problem defines M_n as a sparse upper Hessenberg matrix whose eigenvalues
    are on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. We choose a simple matrix that fits
    this description: a bidiagonal matrix with -2 on the diagonal and 1 on the
    superdiagonal. Its eigenvalues are all -2, which is on the Mandelbrot set boundary.

    The problem asks to minimize f(n) = Tr(D_n) * (Det(D_n))^(1/n). The size of
    the matrix N = 2**(n+1)-1 grows very fast with n. This causes f(n) to grow
    rapidly as well. Therefore, the minimum value is achieved at the smallest
    possible n, which we take as n_0 = 1.

    For n_0 = 1, the matrix size is N = 2**(1+1)-1 = 3.

    N = 2**(n0 + 1) - 1

    # Step 2: Construct the matrix M_{n_0}
    M = np.zeros((N, N))
    for i in range(N):
        M[i, i] = -2
        if i < N - 1:

    A = (M - M.T) / 2
    
    print("\nThe antisymmetric part A_{n_0} is:")
    print(A)

    # Step 4: Compute the diagonal of the cofactor matrix of A_{n_0}.
    # The cofactor C_ii is (-1)^(i+i) * det(A without row i, col i).

    # Step 5: Final calculation.
    # A is a skew-symmetric matrix of odd dimension N, so its cofactor matrix C
    # has rank <= 1. The Parlett-Reid decomposition of C produces a diagonal
    # matrix T (which is a special case of tridiagonal). T will have at most one
    # non-zero entry, d_1, which is the first pivot chosen. This pivot will be
    # the diagonal element of C with the largest magnitude.
    # Let max_C_ii = max_i |C_ii|. Then T = diag(max_C_ii, 0, ...).
    # T^2 = diag(max_C_ii^2, 0, ...).
    # The Ky Fan k-norms are sums of singular values. The largest Ky Fan norm
    # is usually interpreted as the spectral norm (k=1), which is the largest
    # singular value. The largest singular value of T^2 is max_C_ii^2.
