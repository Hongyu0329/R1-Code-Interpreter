def solve_quiver_taft_problem():
    """
    This function demonstrates the derived condition for the quiver-Taft map problem.
    
    Part (a) Answer: No. The existence of a non-zero sigma does not imply g
    must be a reflection, as other actions (like the identity) can also support
    a non-zero sigma map.

    Part (b) Condition: A condition on d for which sigma(a) is not forced to be
    zero is d = 2n. This is because this condition avoids two scenarios that
    force sigma(a) = 0:
    1. For an arrow a: i -> j (i!=j), the condition i+j = n-d is never met for
       non-negative i,j if n > 0, because n-d = -n is negative.
    2. The condition for a g-fixed vertex, 2i = n-d, is also never met for
       non-negative i if n > 0.

    The code below demonstrates this condition for an example case.
    """
    n = 6
    d = 12
    
    # The condition is d = 2n, which can be written as d - 2n = 0.
    # We verify this with the chosen values for n and d.
    
    condition_result = d - 2 * n
    
    print("Answer to (a): No.")
    print("\nA condition on d for (b) is d = 2*n.")
    print("This can be expressed as the equation: d - 2*n = 0.")
    print("\nVerifying this for the example case n=6, d=12:")
    
    # Print the equation with the numbers substituted in.
    print(f"{d} - 2 * {n} = {condition_result}")
    
    if condition_result == 0:
        print("The condition d = 2*n is satisfied.")
    else:
        print("The condition d = 2*n is NOT satisfied.")
