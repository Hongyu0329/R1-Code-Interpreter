    "To solve this, I will analyze the phonological history of each word. The core concept is **Trisyllabic Laxing**, a rule in English where a long/tense vowel becomes short/lax when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word. For example, the tense vowel /eɪ/ in *sane* becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in the three-syllable word *sanity*.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Examine each word in the provided list.\n2.  Compare each word to its root form to see if a vowel change has occurred (from tense to lax).\n3.  Check if this change corresponds to the trisyllabic laxing rule or a similar vowel-shortening process.\n4.  Identify the single word whose vowel was not laxed from a prior tense state. The script will print this analysis step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_vowel_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which one did not undergo trisyllabic laxing.\n    Trisyllabic laxing shortens a tense vowel when it falls on the third-to-last syllable.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data structure containing the linguistic analysis for each word.\n    words_analysis = [\n        {\n            \"word\": \"southern\",\n            \"base_form_and_vowel\": \"south (/aʊ/)\",\n            \"derived_vowel\": \"/ʌ/\",\n            \"underwent_laxing\": True,\n            \"explanation\": \"Shows vowel shortening from the base word 'south'.
