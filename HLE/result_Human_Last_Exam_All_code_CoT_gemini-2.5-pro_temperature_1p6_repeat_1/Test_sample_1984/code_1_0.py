# The variable 'm' represents the number of stable equilibrium points.
# From the analysis of the differential equation, we found m = 1.
m = 1

# The other parts of the expression are the base and the exponent.
base = 2
exponent = 4048

# Calculate the final result. Python's built-in integer type can handle
# numbers of any size, so we can compute this large value precisely.
result = m - (base**exponent)

# Print the final equation with all the specific numbers and the result.
