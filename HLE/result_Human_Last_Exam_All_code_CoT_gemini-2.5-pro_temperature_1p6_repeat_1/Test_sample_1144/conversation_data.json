    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) while it is in the first Bohr orbit.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$)**: We will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. For the minimum uncertainty, we can write $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\cdot \\Delta x}$. The uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) is given as 10 pm.\n2.  **Calculate the momentum ($p$) in the first Bohr orbit**: According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum of an electron is quantized: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$. For the first orbit, n=1, and the momentum is $p=mv$. Therefore, the momentum is $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$, where $r_1$ is the Bohr radius (approximately $5.29 \\times 10^{-11}$ m).\n3.  **Find the ratio ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$)**: By dividing the expression for $\\Delta p$ by the expression for $p$, the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$) cancels out, giving us a simple formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar / (2 \\cdot \\Delta x)}{\\hbar / r_1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\cdot \\Delta x}$\n4.  **Compute the final value**: We will substitute the known values for the Bohr radius ($r_1$) and the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) into this simplified formula to get the numerical ratio.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants\n    # Bohr radius (r1) in meters for the first orbit (n=1).\n    r1 = 5.29177e-11  # meters\n\n    # Given uncertainty in position in picometers.\n    delta_x_pm = 10.0\n\n    # Convert the uncertainty in position from picometers to meters.\n    delta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12  # meters\n\n    # The ratio is derived as r1 / (2 * delta_x).\n    # delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x) from Heisenberg's principle.\n    # p = h_bar / r1 from Bohr's model for the first orbit.\n    # The ratio delta_p / p simplifies to r1 / (2 * delta_x).\n    ratio = r1 / (2 * delta_x_m)\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in.\n    print(\"The ratio is calculated using the formula: r1 / (2 * delta_x)\")\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(f\"  r1 (Bohr Radius) = {r1} m\")\n    print(f\"  delta_x (Position Uncertainty) = {delta_x_m} m\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {r1} / (2 * {delta_x_m})\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated ratio is: {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_momentum_ratio()\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
