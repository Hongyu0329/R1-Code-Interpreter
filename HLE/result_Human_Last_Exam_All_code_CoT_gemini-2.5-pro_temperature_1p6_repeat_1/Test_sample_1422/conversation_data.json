    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and its Rules:** The problem specifies an \"interacting scalar field theory.\" The simplest and most common example is the **$\\phi^4$ theory**, where the interaction vertex involves four scalar field lines meeting at a point.\n2.  **Use Topological Formula:** I will use the standard formula from graph theory that relates the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V) in a connected Feynman diagram:\n    `L = I - V + 1`\n3.  **Use Vertex Rule:** For a $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has four lines attached. These lines are either internal (connecting to another vertex) or external (representing incoming/outgoing particles). This gives us a second equation:\n    `4 * V = 2 * I + E`\n    where E is the number of external lines.\n4.  **Combine and Solve for Vertices (V):** I will combine these two equations to derive a formula for V in terms of L and E.\n5.  **Minimize Vertices:** The problem asks for the *minimum* number of vertices. The derived formula will show that V is minimized when the number of external lines (E) is minimized. The smallest possible number of external lines for a valid diagram is E=0, which corresponds to a \"vacuum diagram\".\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** By setting L=2 (for a two-loop diagram) and E=0 (for the minimum case) in the formula, I will calculate the minimum number of vertices. The Python script will perform this final calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\n# The number of loops in the Feynman diagram.\nL = 2\n\n# To find the minimum number of vertices, we must consider the diagram\n# with the minimum possible number of external lines (E).\n# A vacuum diagram has E=0, which is the minimum possible value.\nE_min = 0\n\n# For a scalar phi^4 theory, the number of vertices (V) is related to\n# the number of loops (L) and external lines (E) by the formula:\n# V = L - 1 + E / 2\n\n# We plug in the values L=2 and E=0 to find the minimum number of vertices.\nV_min = L - 1 + E_min / 2\n\nprint(\"The formula for the number of vertices (V) in a phi^4 theory is: V = L - 1 + E / 2\")\nprint(\"Where L is the number of loops and E is the number of external lines.\")\nprint(\"\\nWe are looking for a two-loop diagram, so L = 2.\")\nprint(\"To find the *minimum* number of vertices, we use the minimum number of external lines, E = 0.\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging these values into the formula:\")\n# The final equation with each number explicitly shown\nprint(f\"V_min = {L} - 1 + {int(E_min)} / 2\")\nprint(f\"V_min = {int(V_min)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices is 1.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to a 'figure-eight' vacuum diagram where two loops are attached to a single vertex.\")\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
