# The problem is to compute the limit of f(k+1) - f(k) as k approaches infinity.
# f(k) is the minimum number of states of a Turing Machine to decide the language
# L_k = {w in {0,1}* : number of 1s in w is divisible by k}.
#
# Based on the reasoning that the limit must exist and be an integer, we conclude
# that the state complexity f(k) must grow linearly with k, similar to a DFA.
# Let's assume the most efficient Turing Machine requires k states, so f(k) = k.
#
# We now compute the expression inside the limit.
# For any k, f(k+1) - f(k) = (k+1) - k.

k_plus_1 = "f(k+1)"
k_val = "f(k)"

# In our model, f(k) = k.
# The difference is (k+1) - k = 1.
difference = 1

# The limit of a constant value is the value itself.
limit = difference

print(f"Let the state complexity function be f(k). We are computing lim_{{k->inf}} [f(k+1) - f(k)].")
print(f"Based on our analysis, we model the function as f(k) = k.")
print(f"So we evaluate the difference: {k_plus_1} - {k_val} = (k+1) - k = {difference}")
print(f"The limit of this difference as k approaches infinity is {limit}.")

# Final answer is the result of the limit calculation.
