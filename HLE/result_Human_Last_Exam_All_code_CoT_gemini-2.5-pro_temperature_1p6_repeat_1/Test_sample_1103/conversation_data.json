    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem using a Python script.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the number of negative fundamental discriminants `D` for which the quadratic field **Q(âˆšD)** has a class number of 48.\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool:** Problems in computational number theory, like calculating class numbers, are best handled by specialized libraries. I will use the `cypari2` Python library, which provides an interface to the powerful PARI/GP computer algebra system. This is a standard tool for such calculations.\n3.  **Develop the Algorithm:**\n    *   I will write a Python script that iterates through negative integers `D` starting from -3.\n    *   For each `D`, the script will first check if it is a \"fundamental discriminant\". The `cypari2` library has a built-in function for this.\n    *   If `D` is a fundamental discriminant, the script will then compute its class number, again using a `cypari2` function.\n    *   If the computed class number is exactly 48, a counter will be incremented.\n4.  **Define the Search Range:** A critical part of the search is knowing where to stop. Based on established mathematical research (specifically the work of M. Watkins), the largest absolute value for a discriminant with class number 48 is known to be 593,839. To be safe, my script will search up to an absolute value of 600,000.\n5.  **Acknowledge Performance:** This comprehensive search is computationally intensive. The script will take several minutes to execute, as it needs to perform complex calculations for hundreds of thousands of numbers.\n6.  **Format the Output:** The final count will be printed. To satisfy the requirement of showing the \"final equation\", I will display the sum of `1` for each discriminant found, which equals the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the cypari2 library installed:\n# pip install cypari2\n\nimport cypari2\nimport time\n\n# --- Plan ---\n# 1. We need to find the number of negative fundamental discriminants D < 0\n#    such that the class number h(D) is 48.\n# 2. We will use the cypari2 library, which is a Python wrapper for the\n#    powerful PARI/GP number theory system.\n# 3. The script will iterate through potential discriminants up to a known\n#    limit and check the class number for each.\n#\n# --- WARNING ---\n# This script performs a computationally intensive search and will likely\n# take several minutes to run.\n\n# Initialize the PARI/GP environment via cypari2\ntry:\n    pari = cypari2.Pari()\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the cypari2 library using 'pip install cypari2'\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"Starting the search for discriminants with class number 48...\")\nprint(\"This process will take several minutes.\")\n\n# From Mark Watkins's paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\",\n# the largest discriminant (in absolute value) with class number 48 is 593839.\n# We set our search limit slightly higher to be comprehensive.\nsearch_limit = 600000\n\n# List to store the numbers that form our final \"equation\"\nequation_numbers = []\n\nstart_time = time.time()\n\n# Iterate through possible negative discriminants.\n# D must be < 0.
