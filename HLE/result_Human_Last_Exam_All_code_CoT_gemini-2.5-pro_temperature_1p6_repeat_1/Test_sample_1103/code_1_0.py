# --- Plan ---
# 1. We need to find the number of negative fundamental discriminants D < 0
#    such that the class number h(D) is 48.
# 2. We will use the cypari2 library, which is a Python wrapper for the
#    powerful PARI/GP number theory system.
# 3. The script will iterate through potential discriminants up to a known
#    limit and check the class number for each.
#
# --- WARNING ---
# This script performs a computationally intensive search and will likely
# take several minutes to run.
