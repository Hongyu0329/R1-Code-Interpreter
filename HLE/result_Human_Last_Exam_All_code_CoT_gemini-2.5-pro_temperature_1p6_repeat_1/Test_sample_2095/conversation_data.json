    "My plan is to find the original text of Liu Ban's (刘攽) evaluation of Zhang Ji's (张籍) seven-character poems. The most authoritative source for this is Liu Ban's own work on poetry criticism, the *Zhongshan Shihua* (《中山诗话》). After locating the specific passage, I will interpret its meaning to provide a clear and accurate answer in Chinese.\n\nBecause the instructions require a code-based solution, I will write a Python script. This script will contain the detailed explanation of Liu Ban's evaluation as a string and will use the `print()` function to display it to the user. This fulfills the request to provide the answer via an executable script.\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\ndef print_evaluation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints Liu Ban's detailed evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems,\n    based on his comments in \"Zhongshan Shihua\" (《中山诗话》).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    evaluation = \"\"\"根据北宋刘攽在其著作《中山诗话》中的评价，他对张籍七言诗的确切看法如下：\n\n原文为：“然其七言诗，句虽精苦，然颇伤于气格。前辈云：‘张籍诗骨，韩愈诗肉。’非知言也。籍诗正是肌理细腻，而无有骨格尔。”\n\n这段评价可以解读为：\n\n1.  **“句虽精苦，然颇伤于气格”**：刘攽首先承认张籍七言诗的诗句（句）是经过精心锤炼的，写得非常精致、深刻（精苦）。然而，他认为这些诗在整体的气势、风格和风骨（气格）上有所欠缺和损害。\n\n2.  **“籍诗正是肌理细腻，而无有骨格尔”**：刘攽进一步反驳了前人“张籍的诗是骨头，韩愈的诗是血肉”的观点。他认为，恰恰相反，张籍的诗歌特点是细节描写得非常精细，如同肌肤的纹理（肌理细腻），但却缺乏强有力的内在结构和骨力（无有骨格）。\n\n总结来说，刘攽认为张籍的七言诗虽然字句优美，但在篇章的整体力量感和风骨上是薄弱的，是一种细节上乘但骨架不强的诗风。\"\"\"\n\n    print(evaluation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_evaluation()\n```\n<<<刘攽认为张籍的七言诗“句虽精苦，然颇伤于气格”，其特点是“肌理细腻，而无有骨格尔”。>>>"
