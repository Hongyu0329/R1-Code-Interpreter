    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will find the answer from my knowledge base and present it using a Python script. The script will store the number of depressions in a variable and then print a sentence that answers your question.\n\n```python\n# The question asks for a specific anatomical detail of the dinosaur Irritator challengeri.\n# Based on scientific literature, particularly the 2002 description by Sues et al.,\n# this information can be retrieved.\n\n# Storing the known fact in a variable.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# Printing the answer in a full sentence.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
