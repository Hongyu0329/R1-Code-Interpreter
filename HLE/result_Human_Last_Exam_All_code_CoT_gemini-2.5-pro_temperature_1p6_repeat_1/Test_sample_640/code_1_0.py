def solve_scattering_problem():

    Analyzes the statements about two-channel quantum scattering and prints the correct ones.

    Based on the analysis of how the property of "nontrivial coupling" propagates:
    - The coupling property of the potential V(r) and the Jost matrix F(E) are equivalent.
      A potential is trivially coupled if and only if its Jost matrix is. (TC_V <=> TC_F)
    - A trivially coupled potential/Jost matrix leads to a trivially coupled S-matrix.
      (TC_V => TC_F => TC_S)
    - The reverse is not true due to "transparent potentials," where a nontrivially coupled
      potential V (and thus a nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F) can produce a trivial
      (e.g., diagonal) S-matrix.

    This leads to the following evaluation:
    1. Correct. It's the contrapositive of (TC_V => TC_S).
    2. False. A transparent potential is a counterexample.
    3. Correct. It follows from (TC_V <=> TC_F).
    4. False. A transparent potential is a counterexample.
    5. False. A diagonal F is trivially coupled, which implies V must also be trivially coupled.
