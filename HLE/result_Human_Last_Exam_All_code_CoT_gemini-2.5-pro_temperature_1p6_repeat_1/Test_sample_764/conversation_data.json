    "The core of this question is about the equivalence between two different formulations of the Lasso regression: the constrained version (using a budget `t`) and the penalized version (using a penalty `Œª`).\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equivalence**: I will first analyze the relationship between the two forms. In convex optimization, there is a strong correspondence between a constrained problem and its penalized (Lagrangian) form. For Lasso, the objective function (Residual Sum of Squares) is convex, and the L1-norm constraint/penalty is also convex. This establishes a basis for equivalence.\n2.  **The Role of Path Continuity**: The solution path for the Lasso coefficients, `Œ≤(Œª)`, as a function of the penalty `Œª`, is continuous and piecewise linear. This continuity is crucial because it ensures that as we sweep `Œª` from 0 to infinity, we trace out the entire set of possible solutions without any gaps. This implies that for any given solution budget `t = ||Œ≤||‚ÇÅ`, we can typically find a corresponding `Œª` that produces it.\n3.  **Identify the Exception**: The \"always strictly true\" part of the question prompts us to look for exceptions. The equivalence can break down if the solution to the Lasso problem is not unique. This happens when the predictor matrix `X` does not have full column rank, for instance, if some predictors are perfectly collinear. In such cases, the set of solutions for the constrained problem can be different from the set of solutions for the penalized problem. The penalized form tends to select a sparse solution (picking one variable from a collinear group), while the constrained form might permit an infinite number of solutions along a line segment.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Since a case exists where the equivalence is not strictly perfect, the statement \"Is it always strictly true...\" is false.\n5.  **Code for Illustration**: To debunk incorrect reasoning provided in some answer choices, I will provide Python code that generates a Lasso path plot. This plot will visually confirm that the coefficient paths are continuous, proving that any answer choice claiming the path is not continuous is based on a flawed premise.\n6.  **Final Answer Selection**: Based on the analysis, the statement is false. The most accurate reason among the choices is that the equivalence is not guaranteed under all conditions (like non-uniqueness) but holds in many practical cases. This matches choice E.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import lasso_path\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Generate synthetic data and compute the Lasso path to demonstrate its continuity.\n# The Lasso path shows how the regression coefficients change as the regularization parameter lambda (Œ±) varies.\n# This visualization will help in evaluating the answer choices.\nX, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=10, n_informative=5, noise=25, random_state=42)\n\n# The function `lasso_path` computes the coefficients along the path.\n# We choose a range of alpha values to trace the path from the OLS solution towards zero.\nalphas, coefs, _ = lasso_path(X, y, eps=1e-3, n_alphas=200, fit_intercept=False)\n\n# Step 3: Plot the coefficient paths.\n# Each line in the plot represents the value of a single coefficient Œ≤_j as a function of Œ±.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 7))\ncolors = plt.cm.get_cmap('tab10', X.shape[1])\n\nfor i in range(X.shape[1]):\n    # We plot |Œ≤_j| vs. ||Œ≤||‚ÇÅ to show the evolution relative to the budget 't'.\n    # This is an alternative and common way to view the LARS-Lasso path.\n    l1_norm = np.sum(np.abs(coefs), axis=0)\n    plt.plot(l1_norm, coefs[i, :], color=colors(i), label=f'$\\\\beta_{{{i+1}}}$')\n\n# Final plot formatting\nplt.xlabel(\"L1 Norm of Coefficients ($t = \\\\sum_j |\\\\beta_j|$)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Coefficient Values ($\\\\beta_j$)\")\nplt.title(\"Lasso Coefficient Paths\")\nplt.legend(loc='upper left')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n# Step 4: Explain the conclusion from the plot and theory.\nprint(\"The plot demonstrates that the Lasso coefficients (Œ≤_j) change continuously as their L1 norm (the budget 't') changes.\")\nprint(\"This visual evidence contradicts the reasoning in choices A, C, and H, which incorrectly claim the path is not continuous.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe two formulations of Lasso are:\")\nprint(\"1.
