    Analyzes whether Kant's account of aesthetic judgment is descriptive or normative.

    In Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Judgment," the account of aesthetic judgment has two clear aspects.
    
    1.  The Descriptive Aspect: Kant describes the cognitive faculties and their interaction. He explains *how* the mind works when it makes a judgment of taste, positing a "free play" between the faculties of imagination and understanding. This is a description of a mental process.

    2.  The Normative Aspect: However, Kant also sets forth the conditions for a *pure* or *valid* judgment of taste. He argues that for a judgment to be genuinely aesthetic, it *ought* to be disinterested (free from personal desire for the object) and must lay claim to universal agreement. By setting these criteria, he is not just describing any judgment people might happen to make; he is prescribing the rules for a judgment to count as a proper, valid aesthetic judgment. This establishes a norm.

    Conclusion: Because the account both describes the process and prescribes the conditions for a valid judgment, it is not purely descriptive. It is both descriptive and normative.
