# The problem asks for the number of extensionally distinct functions induced
# by "shallow" expressions. Our analysis shows this number can be calculated
# as a power tower.

# The base of the logic is boolean (True/False), so our main base is 2.
base = 2

# The variable `p` takes 3 arguments. Each argument is a predicate of type X->Bool.
num_predicate_arguments = 3

# Under the "shallow" condition, p cannot be applied to an argument that depends on p.
# By parametricity, any such p-independent predicate must be a constant function,
# either always returning True or always returning False.
# So, there are 2 choices for each argument of p.
num_base_predicates = 2

# The number of ways to "probe" p is the number of combinations of these base predicates.
# This determines the number of inputs to the effective boolean function that `e` represents.
num_probes = num_base_predicates ** num_predicate_arguments

# The number of distinct functions is the number of possible boolean functions on `num_probes` variables.
# The number of boolean functions of n variables is 2**(2**n).
# Here, we have num_probes as our n.
num_functions = base ** (base ** num_probes)

# The final equation is 2**(2**8).
# The numbers in this equation are:
final_base = 2
final_exponent_base = 2
final_exponent_of_exponent = 8 # which is 2**3
