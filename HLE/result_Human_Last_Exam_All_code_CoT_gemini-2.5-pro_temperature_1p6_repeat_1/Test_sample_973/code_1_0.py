    Determines the final sung note of "Happy Birthday to You".

    The problem provides a complex chord progression for a reharmonized version of
    "Happy Birthday to You". However, it asks for the note that is *sung* for the
    final word "you". The sung part is the melody, which is distinct from the
    chords (the harmony).

    The melody of "Happy Birthday" is standard and universally known. In its most
    common key (C Major), the final phrase has a specific sequence of notes.
