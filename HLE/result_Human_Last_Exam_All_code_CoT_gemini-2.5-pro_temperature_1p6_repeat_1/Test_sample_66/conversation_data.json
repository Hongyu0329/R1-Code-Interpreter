    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix:** The flag of Tonga consists of a red field (`value a`) and a white canton in the top-left corner. This canton is itself a white rectangle (`value b`) with a red cross (`value a`) inside it. We can represent this flag as a matrix `M` where each pixel corresponds to an entry with value `a` or `b`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Unique Row Types:** Regardless of the resolution of the image, the rows of the matrix `M` can be classified into at most two distinct types:\n    *   **Type 1 (All-Red Row):** A row that passes through the main red field below the canton, or through the horizontal bar of the red cross within the canton. Every element in such a row is `a`. Let's call this vector `v_red`.\n    *   **Type 2 (Mixed-Content Row):** A row that passes through the canton but not through the horizontal bar of the cross. This row will contain white pixels (`b`) and red pixels (`a` from the vertical bar of the cross). Crucially, every row of this type will have the exact same pattern of `a`'s and `b`'s. Let's call this vector `v_mixed`.\n\n3.  **Relate Row Types to Matrix Rank:** The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its row vectors. Since every row in the entire flag matrix is either an instance of `v_red` or `v_mixed`, the row space is spanned by these two vectors. Therefore, the rank of the matrix can be at most 2.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximal Rank:** The rank will be exactly 2 if `v_red` and `v_mixed` are linearly independent. It will be less than 2 if they are linearly dependent. They are linearly dependent if one is a scalar multiple of the other (e.g., `v_mixed = k * v_red`).\n    *   This dependency occurs if `a = b` (making `v_red` and `v_mixed` identical, rank 1), or if `a = 0` (making `v_red` the zero vector, which makes any set containing it linearly dependent, leading to rank 1).\n    *   For any other choice, such as `a=1` and `b=2`, the two vectors are linearly independent, and the rank is 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since a rank of 2 is achievable, this is the maximal possible rank.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this analysis by defining the two characteristic row vectors and calculating the rank of the space they span for different choices of `a` and `b`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rank of a matrix representing the Tongan flag\n    by modeling the two unique row types that can appear in it.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We represent the two unique row types found in the flag matrix.\n    # We don't need to build the full, high-resolution flag matrix.
