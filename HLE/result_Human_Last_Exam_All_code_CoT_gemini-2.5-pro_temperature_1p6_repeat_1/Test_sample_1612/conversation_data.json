    "To determine the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we need to count the number of unique players who have achieved this feat. A Triple Crown can be won by either a batter or a pitcher.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Define a list of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown (leading their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs).\n2.  Define a list of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown (leading their league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA).\n3.  Count the number of players in each list.\n4.  Add these two counts together to find the total number of unique Triple Crown winners.\n5.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef count_mlb_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the total number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    It considers both batting and pitching Triple Crowns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Source: Major League Baseball historical records.\n    # List of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n    # Some players, like Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams, won it multiple times but are counted once.\n    batting_winners = [\n        \"Paul Hines\", \"Tip O'Neill\", \"Hugh Duffy\", \"Nap Lajoie\", \"Ty Cobb\",\n        \"Heinie Zimmerman\", \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"Chuck Klein\", \"Jimmie Foxx\",\n        \"Lou Gehrig\", \"Joe Medwick\", \"Ted Williams\", \"Mickey Mantle\",\n        \"Frank Robinson\", \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n    ]\n    num_batting_winners = len(batting_winners)\n\n    # List of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n    # Players like Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax, and others won multiple times but are counted once.\n    pitching_winners = [\n        \"Tommy Bond\", \"Old Hoss Radbourn\", \"Tim Keefe\", \"John Clarkson\", \"Amos Rusie\",\n        \"Rube Waddell\", \"Christy Mathewson\", \"Walter Johnson\", \"Dazzy Vance\",\n        \"Pete Alexander\", \"Lefty Grove\", \"Lefty Gomez\", \"Bucky Walters\",\n        \"Bob Feller\", \"Hal Newhouser\", \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Dwight Gooden\",\n        \"Roger Clemens\", \"Pedro Mart√≠nez\", \"Randy Johnson\", \"Johan Santana\",\n        \"Clayton Kershaw\", \"Justin Verlander\", \"Shane Bieber\"\n    ]\n    num_pitching_winners = len(pitching_winners)\n\n    # Calculate the total number of unique winners.\n    total_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\n    print(f\"Number of unique batting Triple Crown winners: {num_batting_winners}\")\n    print(f\"Number of unique pitching Triple Crown winners: {num_pitching_winners}\")\n    print(f\"Total MLB Triple Crown Winners = {num_batting_winners} + {num_pitching_winners} = {total_winners}\")\n\ncount_mlb_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<40>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
