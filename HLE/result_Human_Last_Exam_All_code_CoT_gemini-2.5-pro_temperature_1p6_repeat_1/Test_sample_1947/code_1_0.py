# Based on the combinatorial analysis, we determine the coefficients.
# c1: Contribution from single-edge (P_2) trees. A walk of length 6 on one
#     edge involves 3 back-and-forth traversals. Starting from either of the 2
#     vertices gives 2 distinct walks.
c1 = 2

# c2: Contribution from K_3 (triangle) subgraphs. A "tree-like" walk cannot have an
#     underlying edge set that forms a cycle. A K_3 is a cycle. Thus, there
#     is no direct contribution, and testing on a K_3 graph confirms this.
c2 = 0

# c3: Contribution from P_4 (path of length 3) trees. The walk involves
#     traversing each of the 3 edges back and forth once. A detailed count
#     shows there are 6 such walks for each P_4.
c3 = 6

# c4: Contribution from P_3 (path of length 2) trees. The walk involves
#     traversing one edge twice (back-and-forth once) and the other four times
#     (back-and-forth twice). A detailed count shows there are 8 such walks for each P_3.
#     The number of P_3 subgraphs is given by sum(deg(v) choose 2).
c4 = 8

# c5: Contribution from K_1,3 (3-star) trees. The walk involves traversing
#     each of the 3 edges back and forth once. A detailed count shows there
#     are 12 such walks for each K_1,3. The number of K_1,3 subgraphs is
#     given by sum(deg(v) choose 3).
c5 = 12

# The problem asks for the coefficients c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5 in this order.
coefficients = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]

# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation!".
# We interpret this as printing the values of the coefficients.
