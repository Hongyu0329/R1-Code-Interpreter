# The problem constraints lead to the conclusion that the pairwise distances
# between the 5 points must form a 5-cycle graph structure.
# Let 'a' be the side length and 'd' be the diagonal length of the pentagonal
# arrangement of the points. For a regular pentagon, d > a.
# The condition on r becomes: a < r <= d.

# To find the largest possible r, we need to maximize d.
# A regular pentagon can be placed in a unit square if its dimensions are less than or equal to 1.
# The width of a regular pentagon is equal to its diagonal length 'd'.
# So, the maximum possible diagonal length is d=1.

# Set the diagonal length for our optimal pentagon.
diagonal_length = 1.0

# In a regular pentagon, the ratio of the diagonal to the side is the golden ratio.
golden_ratio = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2
side_length = diagonal_length / golden_ratio

# The final condition for r is expressed by the inequality involving these lengths.
# The code below will print the numbers for this final equation.

print("The relationship between r and the pentagon's dimensions is given by the inequality:")

print(f"diagonal_length = {diagonal_length}")

print(f"{side_length} < r <= {diagonal_length}")

# The largest real number r that can satisfy this inequality is the maximum value in the range.
