    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Wavefunction**: The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is given by:\n    ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density**: The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude:\n    P(x) = |ψₙ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n3.  **Set up the Integral**: The probability of finding the particle in the interval from `x₁` to `x₂` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    P = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx\n4.  **Solve the Integral**: The analytical solution to this integral is:\n    P = [x/a - (1/(2nπ)) * sin(2nπx/a)] evaluated from x₁ to x₂.\n    This gives the final formula:\n    P = (x₂/a - x₁/a) - (1/(2nπ)) * [sin(2nπx₂/a) - sin(2nπx₁/a)]\n5.  **Calculate the Value**: We will use Python to plug in the given values (`n=2`, `x₁=0.495a`, `x₂=0.505a`) into this formula and compute the final probability.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this calculation and print out the equation with the values, as well as the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a given interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given parameters\n    n = 2\n    x1_div_a = 0.495\n    x2_div_a = 0.505\n\n    # The probability is found by integrating the probability density |ψ(x)|² from x1 to x2.\n    # The analytical solution for P = ∫[x1 to x2] (2/a)sin²(nπx/a) dx is:\n    # P = [x/a - (1/(2nπ))sin(2nπx/a)] from x1 to x2.\n    # P = (x2/a - x1/a) - (1/(2nπ)) * [sin(2nπx2/a) - sin(2nπx1/a)]\n\n    # Calculate the components of the equation\n    delta_x_div_a = x2_div_a - x1_div_a\n    \n    coeff_inv = 2 * n * math.pi\n    coeff = 1 / coeff_inv\n\n    arg2 = 2 * n * math.pi * x2_div_a\n    arg1 = 2 * n * math.pi * x1_div_a\n    \n    sin_term2 = math.sin(arg2)\n    sin_term1 = math.sin(arg1)\n    \n    # Calculate the final probability\n    probability = delta_x_div_a - coeff * (sin_term2 - sin_term1)\n\n    # Print the equation with numerical values as requested\n    print(\"The probability P is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"P = (x₂/a - x₁/a) - (1/(2nπ)) * [sin(2nπx₂/a) - sin(2nπx₁/a)]\")\n    print(\"\\nWith n = 2, x₁/a = 0.495, and x₂/a = 0.505, the equation becomes:\")\n    print(f\"P = ({x2_div_a} - {x1_div_a}) - (1 / (2 * {n} * π)) * [sin(2 * {n} * π * {x2_div_a}) - sin(2 * {n} * π * {x1_div_a})]\")\n    print(f\"P = {delta_x_div_a} - (1 / {coeff_inv:.6f}) * [{sin_term2:.6f} - ({sin_term1:.6f})]\")\n    print(f\"P = {delta_x_div_a} - {coeff:.6f} * [{sin_term2 - sin_term1:.6f}]\")\n\n    # Print the final result\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculated probability is:\")\n    print(f\"P = {probability:.8f}\")\n\n    return probability\n\n# Run the calculation and store the result\nfinal_probability = calculate_probability()\n\n# The final answer in the requested format will be outputted at the end.\n# Note: The printing is done inside the function.\n\n```\n<<<8.45819e-06>>>"
