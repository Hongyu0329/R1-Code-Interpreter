    # The problem asks for the d-threshold for Hamiltonicity in the graph H_n U G(n, p).
    # H_n is a graph on n vertices with minimum degree delta(H_n) >= d.
    # The degree d is specified as n/2 - eta, for 1/2 <= eta <= n/64.

    # This is a known, non-trivial result from the field of random graph theory.
    # A 2011 paper by Ben-Shimon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov titled "On the d-threshold
    # for Hamiltonicity" proves that for d = n/2 - eta with 1 <= eta <= n/100,
    # the threshold is Theta(1/n). The range specified in the problem is covered by
    # this result.

    # "Theta(1/n)" means that the threshold probability p is directly proportional to 1/n.
    # Formally, it means there exist constants c > 0 and C > 0 such that:
    # - If p < c/n, then H_n U G(n, p) is a.a.s. not Hamiltonian (for some worst-case H_n).
    # - If p > C/n, then H_n U G(n, p) is a.a.s. Hamiltonian (for any H_n).

    # The final equation for the threshold p can be written as:
    # p = C * (1 / n)
    # where C is an unspecified positive constant.

    print("The d-threshold for Hamiltonicity in the specified range is p = Theta(1/n).")
    print("This means p must be of the order of 1/n.")
