    Solves the problem by analyzing the structure of the quotient space.
    The problem describes a space of equivalence classes of pairs (z0, z).
    Our analysis shows that each equivalence class corresponds uniquely to a closed disk
    D(a, r) in C_p, where the radius r = |z0|_p.
    
    The input space is C_p^x * C_p, so z0 is non-zero.
    This means the radius r = |z0|_p is strictly positive (r > 0).
    Also, by definition, the radius r = |z0|_p belongs to the value group |C_p^x|_p.

    According to the standard classification of points on the Berkovich line:
    - Type 1 points correspond to disks of radius r = 0.
    - Type 2 points correspond to disks of radius r > 0, where r is in the value group.
    - Type 3 points correspond to disks of radius r > 0, where r is NOT in the value group.
    
    Since our construction only yields radii r > 0 that are in the value group,
    the resulting subset of the Berkovich line consists exclusively of Type 2 points.
