    print("1. X has a finite number of end points, n, where n > 1. Let's call the set of end points 'E'.")
    print("2. X has exactly two orbits under the action of its group of auto-homeomorphisms, Homeo(X).")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing the consequence of the two-orbit property.")
    print("An auto-homeomorphism preserves topological properties, so it must map an end point to another end point.")
    print("This means the set E must be a union of orbits.")
    print("Since there are only two orbits in total (O1, O2), and E is a proper subset of X (as n is finite and X is a continuum), E must be exactly one of the orbits. Let's say O1 = E.")
    print("This implies two crucial facts:")
    print("  a) All end points in E are topologically equivalent (Homeo(X) acts transitively on E).")
    print("  b) The set of all non-end-points, O2 = X \ E, must form the second orbit and is therefore homogeneous (all its points are topologically equivalent).")

    print("\nStep 3: Testing simple candidate continua against these facts.")
    print("\nCandidate A: A Circle (S^1)")
    print(" - A circle has 0 end points. Fails Property 1.")

    print("\nCandidate B: A Star-Graph (n arms meeting at a center, n > 2)")
    print(" - The n tips are end points, so Property 1 can be met.")
    print(" - The set of non-end-points contains the central branch point and the 'regular' points along the arms.")
    print(" - A branch point is not topologically equivalent to a regular (non-branch) point. They cannot be in the same orbit.")
    print(" - Therefore, the set of non-end-points is not homogeneous. Fails the consequence from Step 2.")
    
    print("\nCandidate C: A Simple Arc (homeomorphic to the interval [0,1])")
    print(" - Let's check X = [0,1].")
    print(" - End Points: The set of end points is E = {0, 1}. The number of end points is 2, which is finite and > 1. Property 1 holds.")
    print(" - Orbits: Any homeomorphism of [0,1] must map the boundary {0, 1} to itself. The map f(x) = 1-x is a homeomorphism that swaps 0 and 1, so E = {0, 1} is a single orbit.")
    print("   The set of non-end-points is the open interval (0,1). For any two points p,q in (0,1), a piecewise linear homeomorphism can be constructed to map p to q while fixing 0 and 1. So (0,1) is the second orbit.")
    print(" - Conclusion: The arc has exactly two orbits, {0,1} and (0,1). Property 2 holds.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion on the number of topological types.")
    print("The simple arc is a continuum that satisfies both properties.")
    print("The powerful constraint that the set of non-end-points must be homogeneous rules out most other structures. Any structure with different 'types' of non-end-points (e.g., branch points, attachment points, etc.) will have more than two orbits.")
    print("This indicates that the simple arc is the only topological type of continuum that fits the description.")
    print("All continua homeomorphic to an arc belong to the same topological type.")

    # The final answer is 1. We can represent this with a trivial equation.
