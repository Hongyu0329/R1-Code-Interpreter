    "To answer your question, I will identify the historical event corresponding to Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam and then pinpoint its location in terms of modern-day provinces.\n\n1.  **Historical Context**: The event occurred during the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427), led by Lê Lợi against the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam. Mu Sheng was one of the primary Ming commanders tasked with suppressing this rebellion.\n2.  **The Defeat**: While Mu Sheng faced several setbacks, his first clear, personal, and major defeat happened in 1425. After Lê Lợi's forces captured the Nghệ An region, Mu Sheng led a large army to counter-attack. Lê Lợi, employing a feigned retreat tactic, lured Mu Sheng's army into an ambush at the Đỗ Gia Pass (Ải Đỗ Gia). The Ming army was routed, suffering heavy casualties, and Mu Sheng himself narrowly escaped.\n3.  **Location**: The Battle of Đỗ Gia took place in the western mountainous area of what was then the Nghệ An prefecture. This area corresponds to the modern-day **Nghệ An Province** of Vietnam.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the province.\n\n```python\ndef find_province_of_defeat():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the modern Vietnamese province\n    where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    general = \"Mu Sheng\"\n    year_of_defeat = 1425\n    battle_name = \"Battle of Đỗ Gia Pass\"\n    province = \"Nghệ An\"\n\n    print(f\"General {general}'s first major defeat occurred in {year_of_defeat} during the {battle_name}.\")\n    print(f\"This event took place in the territory of modern-day Vietnam's province:\")\n    print(province)\n\nfind_province_of_defeat()\n```\n<<<Nghệ An>>>"
