    # Statement F contains two key claims that are strongly supported by evidence.
    # Claim 1: "It adopted an architectural style created for the self glorification of eastern dynasts."
    # This is a major thesis in the study of Augustan Rome. The circular tumulus form,
    # while having Italian/Etruscan precedents, was built on a scale that directly
    # evoked the tombs of Hellenistic kings. Let's assign this a high confidence score.
    claim_1_confidence_score = 95 # Score out of 100

    # Claim 2: "...the full and complete text of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti...was inscribed on it."
    # The Roman historian Suetonius (Life of Augustus, 101) explicitly states this.
    # It is considered a historical fact.

    print("1. Architectural Style: The Mausoleum's design is widely interpreted by architectural historians as a strategic adoption of Hellenistic royal tomb architecture, blending it with Roman traditions to create a powerful statement of Augustus's unique position.")
    print("2. Res Gestae Inscription: The placement of the Res Gestae (Augustus's 'Accomplishments') on bronze pillars at the entrance is confirmed by primary sources like Suetonius. It served as the ultimate political testament and summary of his reign for all to see.")
    print("\nOther options are less accurate. For example:")
    print("- Choice I incorrectly includes the chapel to Archangel Michael, which was a medieval addition, not part of the original structure.")
    print("- Choice D is anachronistic, as large-scale enslavement from Judea occurred after the Mausoleum was built.")
    print("- Choice G makes a debatable claim about its height relative to the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus; it was of a similar, not definitively taller, height.")

    print("\n--------------------------")
