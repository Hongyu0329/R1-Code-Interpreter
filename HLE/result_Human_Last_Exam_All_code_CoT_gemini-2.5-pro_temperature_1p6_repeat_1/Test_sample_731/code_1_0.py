def solve_semidihedral_subgroups():
    """
    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.

    A "power subgroup" is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup
    generated by a single element of the group.

    The group in question is the semidihedral group of order 512, denoted SD_512.
    Its order is 2^n = 512, so n=9. It has the presentation:
    G = <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = e, srs = r^(-1 + 2^(n-2))>
    For n=9, this is G = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = e, srs = r^127>.

    The elements of G are {r^i | 0 <= i < 256} and {sr^i | 0 <= i < 256}.
    We will count the distinct cyclic subgroups by considering these two sets of elements.
