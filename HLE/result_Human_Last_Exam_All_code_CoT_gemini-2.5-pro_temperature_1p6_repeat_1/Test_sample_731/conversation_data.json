    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the semidihedral group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### My Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to find the number of \"power subgroups\" in the \"semidihedral group of size 512\". A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n\n2.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as $SD_{512}$, is one of the p-groups of order $2^n$. Here, $2^n = 512$, so $n=9$. The group $SD_{2^n}$ has a standard presentation:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{-1 + 2^{n-2}} \\rangle$\n    For our case ($n=9$), this becomes:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n    The elements of this group are of the form $r^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$) and $sr^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$).\n\n3.  **Strategy: Partition and Count:** The most effective way to count the distinct cyclic subgroups is to partition the group elements and count the distinct subgroups generated by each partition.\n    *   **Partition 1: The cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.** This is a cyclic group of order 256. The number of subgroups in a cyclic group of order $m$ is simply the number of divisors of $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$. For $m=256=2^8$, the number of divisors is $8+1=9$.\n    *   **Partition 2: The elements of the form $sr^i$.** These elements are not in $\\langle r \\rangle$. We need to determine the orders of these elements to see what kind of cyclic subgroups they generate.\n\n4.  **Calculate Orders for Partition 2:** To find the order of an element $g = sr^i$, we can compute its powers. Let's find $g^2$:\n    *   $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i sr^i = s(r^i s)r^i$.\n    *   From the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can derive the conjugation rule $sr^i s = r^{127i}$.\n    *   Substituting this back, we get $(sr^i)^2 = (r^{127i})r^i = r^{128i}$.\n    *   The order of this resulting element $r^{128i}$ depends on whether $i$ is even or odd.\n        *   If $i$ is **even** ($i=2k$), then $(sr^{2k})^2 = r^{128 \\cdot 2k} = r^{256k} = e$. So, $sr^{2k}$ has order 2. There are $256/2 = 128$ such elements.\n        *   If $i$ is **odd** ($i=2k+1$), then $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$. Since $i$ is odd, $128i \\equiv 128 \\pmod{256}$. So $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128}$. This element has order 2, which means $(sr^i)^4 = e$. Thus, $sr^i$ has order 4. There are $256/2 = 128$ such elements.\n\n5.  **Count Subgroups for Partition 2:**\n    *   **Subgroups of order 2:** The 128 elements $sr^{2k}$ all have order 2. Each one generates a distinct subgroup $\\{e, sr^{2k}\\}$. These are all distinct from the order-2 subgroup in $\\langle r \\rangle$ (which is $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$). This gives us **128** new subgroups.\n    *   **Subgroups of order 4:** The 128 elements $sr^i$ (for odd $i$) all have order 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has two generators (e.g., $g$ and $g^3$). We need to find when two different elements generate the same subgroup. $\\langle g_1 \\rangle = \\langle g_2 \\rangle$ if $g_1 = g_2$ or $g_1 = g_2^3$. For $g=sr^j$, we find $g^3 = sr^{j+128}$. This means that the 128 generators are paired up (e.g., $sr^1$ and $sr^{129}$ generate the same subgroup). This results in $128 / 2 = \\textbf{64}$ new subgroups.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We sum the number of subgroups from all parts:\n    *   From $\\langle r \\rangle$: 9 subgroups.\n    *   From $sr^i$ with $i$ even: 128 subgroups.\n    *   From $sr^i$ with $i$ odd: 64 subgroups.\n    *   Total = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_semidihedral_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n    A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup\n    generated by a single element of the group.\n\n    The group in question is the semidihedral group of order 512, denoted SD_512.\n    Its order is 2^n = 512, so n=9.
