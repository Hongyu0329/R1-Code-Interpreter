    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\nThe number of logical qubits, `k`, that can be encoded in a surface code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The formula is:\n\n`k = 2g + b - 1`\n\nwhere:\n*   `g` is the genus of the surface, which corresponds to the number of \"holes\" or \"handles\".\n*   `b` is the number of boundaries, which corresponds to the number of separate \"patches\".\n\nIn this specific case:\n1.  We have **two holes**, so `g = 2`.\n2.  We have **two patches**, so `b = 2`.\n\nI will use a Python script to substitute these values into the formula and calculate the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the topological properties based on the problem description.\n\n# g represents the genus, which is the number of holes.\ng = 2\n\n# b represents the number of boundaries, which is the number of patches.\nb = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of logical qubits (k) using the formula k = 2g + b - 1.\nk = 2 * g + b - 1\n\n# Print the final equation with the values substituted.\nprint(f\"The maximum number of logical qubits is calculated as k = 2 * g + b - 1.\")\nprint(f\"With g = {g} holes and b = {b} patches, the equation is:\")\nprint(f\"k = 2 * {g} + {b} - 1 = {k}\")\n\n```\n<<<5>>>"
