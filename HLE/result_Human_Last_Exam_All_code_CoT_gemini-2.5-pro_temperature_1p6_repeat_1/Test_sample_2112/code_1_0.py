def solve_for_r0():
    """
    Solves for the radial distance r0 where the gravitational potential vanishes.

    The condition Phi(r0) = 0 leads to one of four possible equations.
    We analyze them here:
    Let f(r) = (4*r + 37) / (3 - r)
    Let g(r) = (3*r - 37) / (r + 4)

    1. f(r0) = 1/sqrt(2)  => r0 = (3 - 37*sqrt(2))/(4*sqrt(2) + 1) which is negative.
    2. f(r0) = -1/sqrt(2) => r0 = (-3 - 37*sqrt(2))/(4*sqrt(2) - 1) which is negative.
    3. g(r0) = -1/sqrt(2) => r0 = (37*sqrt(2) - 4)/(3*sqrt(2) + 1) which is approx 9.22 (< 15).
    4. g(r0) = 1/sqrt(2)  => This is the correct equation that gives r0 > 15.

    The equation we solve is g(r0) = 1/sqrt(2):
    (3*r0 - 37) / (r0 + 4) = 1/sqrt(2)
    sqrt(2) * (3*r0 - 37) = r0 + 4
    3*sqrt(2)*r0 - 37*sqrt(2) = r0 + 4
    (3*sqrt(2) - 1)*r0 = 4 + 37*sqrt(2)
