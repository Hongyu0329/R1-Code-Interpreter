    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n    $u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫_a^b K(x, y) u(y) dy$\n    Here, the forcing function is $f(x) = 1$, the integration limits are 0 to 1, and the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Kernel**: The kernel can be recognized as the sum of a geometric series:\n    $K(x, y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\dots + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}$.\n    This is a \"degenerate\" or \"separable\" kernel, which means it can be written as a finite sum of products of functions of x and functions of y. This property implies that the solution $u(x)$ must belong to a finite-dimensional function space.\n\n3.  **Determine the Form of the Solution**: Substituting the simplified kernel back into the equation gives:\n    $u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k \\int_0^1 y^{n-1-k} u(y) dy$.\n    The integrals $\\int_0^1 y^{n-1-k} u(y) dy$ are just constants (let's call them $c_k$).\n    So, $u(x)$ must be a polynomial in $x$ of degree at most $n-1$:\n    $u(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \\dots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}$.\n\n4.  **Convert to a Linear System**: By substituting the polynomial form of $u(x)$ back into the equation and equating coefficients of like powers of $x$, we can convert the integral equation into a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown coefficients $a_0, \\dots, a_{n-1}$. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n    $(I - λH) \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}$\n    where $\\mathbf{a}$ is the vector of coefficients $[a_0, \\dots, a_{n-1}]^T$, $I$ is the identity matrix, $H$ is a specific $n \\times n$ matrix derived from the kernel, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is a vector derived from the forcing function $f(x)=1$. The derivation shows the matrix $H$ has elements $H_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n-j+k}$ for $j,k = 0, \\dots, n-1$.\n\n5.  **Condition for No Solution**: This linear system has a unique solution if the determinant of the matrix $(I - λH)$ is non-zero. If $\\det(I - λH) = 0$, the system either has no solution or infinitely many solutions. This condition is equivalent to $1/λ$ being an eigenvalue of the matrix $H$. The values of $λ$ for which this occurs are called the characteristic values.\n\n6.  **Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem**: This theorem specifies the condition for existence of a solution when $λ$ is a characteristic value. For a symmetric kernel like ours, the equation has a solution if and only if the forcing function $f(x)=1$ is \"orthogonal\" to the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation ($u_h = λ \\int K(x,y)u_h(y)dy$). The orthogonality condition is:\n    $\\int_0^1 f(x) u_h(x) dx = 0$\n    $\\int_0^1 1 \\cdot u_h(x) dx = 0$.\n\n7.  **Check the Orthogonality Condition**: The key insight is to check if it's possible for an eigenfunction $u_h(x)$ to satisfy this condition. An eigenfunction $u_h(x)$ is a non-zero polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. Based on analysis for small $n$ (like $n=1, 2$) and the structure of the matrix $H$, it can be argued that for any non-trivial eigenfunction $u_h$, the integral $\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx$ is never zero.\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: Since the orthogonality condition is never met, the equation has no solution whenever $λ$ is a characteristic value. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the values of $λ$ such that $1/λ$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $H$.\n\n9.  **Formulate the Code**: The final step is to write a Python script to perform these calculations numerically for a given value of `n`. The script will:\n    a.  Define the integer `n`.\n    b.  Construct the $n \\times n$ matrix $H$.\n    c.  Use a numerical library like NumPy to compute the eigenvalues, $\\mu$, of $H$.\n    d.  Calculate the corresponding values of $λ$ as $1/\\mu$.\n    e.  Print these values.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\n    The method involves transforming the integral equation into a matrix eigenvalue problem.\n    The values of λ for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues\n    of a specific n x n matrix H, where H[j, k] = 1 / (n - j + k).\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The integer exponent in the kernel of the integral equation.\n                 It must be a positive integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Construct the n x n matrix H.
