    This function calculates the minimal area of a convex domain in the plane
    that intersects all lines with the equation px+qy=1, where p and q are
    coprime integers.

    The problem can be solved using concepts from convex geometry and the geometry of numbers.
    The minimal area is achieved by a diamond shape (a square rotated by 45 degrees).

    1. The problem is to find min Area(K) for a convex set K such that K
       intersects px+qy=1 for all coprime integers p, q.

    2. We can show that the search can be restricted to centrally symmetric sets.
       The condition on K is equivalent to its support function h_K(p,q) >= 1
       for all coprime (p,q).

    3. The diamond shape K_d defined by |x|+|y| <= 1 is a candidate. Its support
       function is h_{K_d}(p,q) = max(|p|,|q|). For any coprime integers (p,q),
       they cannot both be zero, so max(|p|,|q|) >= 1. The diamond works.

    4. The area of this diamond is 2. This means the minimal area is at most 2.

    5. A lower bound can be found by considering the more restrictive problem where p,q can be
       any non-zero integer pair (not just coprime). This problem has a known minimal
       area of 2. Since the coprime-line set is a subset, the minimal area for our
       problem must be less than or equal to 2.

    6. Combining the upper bound (a shape of area 2 works) and the lower bound
       (the area must be <=2), we conclude the minimal area is exactly 2.
