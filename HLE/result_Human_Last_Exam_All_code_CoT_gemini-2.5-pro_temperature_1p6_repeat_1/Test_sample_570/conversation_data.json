    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will formalize the problem. We are looking for the minimum area of a convex set `K` in the plane that intersects every line in the set `L = { (x,y) | px + qy = 1, p, q ∈ Z, gcd(p,q) = 1 }`.\n2.  I will analyze the condition \"K intersects the line `px + qy = 1`\". This can be translated into a condition on the support function of `K`, denoted `h_K(u)`. If we assume `K` contains the origin (which does not reduce generality for area), this condition is `-h_K(-p,-q) <= 1 <= h_K(p,q)`.\n3.  Since if `(p,q)` is a primitive integer vector, so is `(-p,-q)`, the condition simplifies to `h_K(p,q) >= 1` for all primitive integer vectors `(p,q)`.\n4.  I will test a simple convex shape, the diamond defined by `|x| + |y| <= 1`, to see if it satisfies the condition. I will calculate its support function and check if it meets the criterion.\n5.  I will calculate the area of this diamond shape. This area will be an upper bound for the minimal area.\n6.  To find a lower bound, I will consider a related problem. The problem of finding a convex set `K` that intersects all lines `px+qy=1` for *all* integer pairs `(p,q)` (not just coprime). The set of lines for the coprime case (`S_prim`) is a subset of the lines for the general integer case (`S_all`). Therefore, `Area_min(S_prim) <= Area_min(S_all)`.\n7.  I will solve the problem for the set `S_all`, which is a known result from the geometry of numbers related to Minkowski's theorem.\n8.  By combining the upper and lower bounds, I will determine the minimal area.\n\nHere are the detailed steps:\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Formalizing the problem**\nLet `K` be a convex set in `R^2`. The line `l_{p,q}` is defined by `px + qy = 1`. The condition is that for every pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, the intersection `K ∩ l_{p,q}` is non-empty.\nLet `u = (p,q)`. The line equation is `<x, u> = 1`. The support function of `K` is `h_K(u) = sup_{x∈K} <x,u>`. A line `<x,u>=c` intersects `K` if and only if `inf_{x∈K} <x,u> <= c <= sup_{x∈K} <x,u>`.\nLet's assume `K` is centered at the origin (translating it does not change its area). Then `inf_{x∈K} <x,u> = -h_K(u)`. The condition becomes `-h_K(u) <= 1 <= h_K(u)`, which is `h_K(u) >= 1`.\nSince the set of primitive vectors `(p,q)` is symmetric (if `u` is primitive, so is `-u`), the condition `h_K(-u) >= 1` is also required. For a symmetric set `K`, `h_K(u)=h_K(-u)`, so the condition remains `h_K(u) >= 1`. If `K` isn't symmetric, we can consider its Minkowski symmetrization `K' = (K-K)/2`. `K'` is centrally symmetric, `Area(K') <= Area(K)`, and it can be shown that if `K` is a solution, so is `K'`. Thus, we can restrict our search to centrally symmetric sets.\nThe problem is to find the minimum area of a centrally symmetric convex set `K` such that `h_K(p,q) >= 1` for all coprime integers `p,q`.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Testing a candidate shape**\nLet's test the diamond-shaped region `K_d` defined by `|x| + |y| <= 1`. This is a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. It is a centrally symmetric convex set.\nIts support function `h_{K_d}(p,q)` is the maximum value of `px+qy` for `(x,y)` in `K_d`. This maximum is achieved at one of the vertices.\n`h_{K_d}(p,q) = max(p*1 + q*0, p*0 + q*1, p*(-1) + q*0, p*0 + q*(-1))`\n`h_{K_d}(p,q) = max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nThe condition is `h_{K_d}(p,q) >= 1`, which means `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\nFor any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, `gcd(p,q)=1`, they cannot both be zero. If one of them is zero, e.g., `p=0`, then `gcd(0,q)=|q|`, so `|q|=1`. In this case, `max(|0|,|1|)=1`, which satisfies the condition. If neither `p` nor `q` is zero, their absolute values are at least 1, so `max(|p|,|q|) >= 1`.\nThus, the diamond `|x|+|y|<=1` intersects all lines `px+qy=1` for coprime `p,q`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the area**\nThe area of the diamond `|x|+|y|<=1` is the area of a square with side length `sqrt(2)`, which is 2. (Or, using the vertices `(1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1)`, it's half the product of the diagonals: `(1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`).\nSo, the minimal area is at most 2. `min_Area <= 2`.\n\n**Step 6 & 7: Finding a lower bound**\nConsider the more general problem where we want `K` to intersect `px+qy=1` for *all* integer pairs `(p,q)` not equal to `(0,0)`. Let `S_all` be this larger set of lines. Let `S_prim` be the original set of lines where `gcd(p,q)=1`.\nSince `S_prim` is a subset of `S_all`, any set `K` that intersects all lines in `S_all` must also intersect all lines in `S_prim`. This implies `min_Area(S_prim) <= min_Area(S_all)`.\nFor the set `S_all`, the condition on `K` is `h_K(p,q) >= 1` for all `(p,q) \\in Z^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}`.\nIn the dual space, this means the interior of the polar body `K^*` cannot contain any non-zero integer lattice points.\nBy Minkowski's first theorem, any centrally symmetric convex set with area greater than 4 must contain a non-zero integer lattice point. Thus, for `int(K^*)` to contain no such points, we must have `Area(K^*) <= 4`.\nFrom Mahler's inequality for 2D centrally symmetric convex bodies, `Area(K) * Area(K^*) >= 8`.\nSo, `Area(K) >= 8 / Area(K^*)`.\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we need to maximize `Area(K^*)`. The maximum possible area for `K^*` is 4.\nThis gives `min_Area(S_all) >= 8 / 4 = 2`.\nThe diamond `|x|+|y|<=1` has area 2, and its polar dual `K^*` is the square `max(|u|,|v|)<=1` (i.e., `[-1,1]x[-1,1]`) which has area 4. This square's interior contains no non-zero lattice points. Thus, `min_Area(S_all) = 2`.\n\n**Step 8: Final Conclusion**\nWe have `min_Area(S_prim) <= min_Area(S_all) = 2`.\nFrom step 5, we have a candidate set `K_d` (the diamond) which is a valid solution for the `S_prim` problem and has an area of 2.\nThis implies `min_Area(S_prim) >= 2`.\nCombining the two inequalities, we get `min_Area(S_prim) = 2`.\n\nThe minimal area is 2. The question also mentions outputting an equation. As no calculation is needed from the user, I'll provide a Python script that simply prints the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the minimal area of a convex domain in the plane\n    that intersects all lines with the equation px+qy=1, where p and q are\n    coprime integers.\n\n    The problem can be solved using concepts from convex geometry and the geometry of numbers.\n    The minimal area is achieved by a diamond shape (a square rotated by 45 degrees).\n\n    1. The problem is to find min Area(K) for a convex set K such that K\n       intersects px+qy=1 for all coprime integers p, q.\n\n    2. We can show that the search can be restricted to centrally symmetric sets.\n       The condition on K is equivalent to its support function h_K(p,q) >= 1\n       for all coprime (p,q).\n\n    3. The diamond shape K_d defined by |x|+|y| <= 1 is a candidate. Its support\n       function is h_{K_d}(p,q) = max(|p|,|q|). For any coprime integers (p,q),\n       they cannot both be zero, so max(|p|,|q|) >= 1. The diamond works.\n\n    4. The area of this diamond is 2. This means the minimal area is at most 2.\n\n    5. A lower bound can be found by considering the more restrictive problem where p,q can be\n       any non-zero integer pair (not just coprime). This problem has a known minimal\n       area of 2. Since the coprime-line set is a subset, the minimal area for our\n       problem must be less than or equal to 2.\n\n    6. Combining the upper bound (a shape of area 2 works) and the lower bound\n       (the area must be <=2), we conclude the minimal area is exactly 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The minimal area is 2.\n    minimal_area = 2\n    \n    # The final prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # As the final answer is a single number, we print it.\n    print(minimal_area)\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
