    print("2. The goal is to find the best *diagnostic* step, not a treatment. This rules out topical steroids (Choice C) as the primary answer to this question.")
    print("3. A KOH preparation (Choice B) is for diagnosing fungal infections. While fungal infections can occur in the axillae, the specific pattern described is much more classic for contact dermatitis.")
    print("4. A skin biopsy (Choice A) is invasive and usually reserved for cases where the diagnosis is unclear or a more serious condition is suspected. For a classic case of suspected contact dermatitis, it's not the best *next* step.")
    print("5. A patch test (Choice D) is the gold standard for identifying the specific allergen in cases of suspected allergic contact dermatitis. It directly tests the patient's reaction to common chemicals found in textiles, like dyes and resins.")
    print("6. The case description itself states: 'Patch testing was performed, and positive reactions were observed to resins used in textile manufacturing', confirming it is the correct diagnostic procedure for this scenario.")
