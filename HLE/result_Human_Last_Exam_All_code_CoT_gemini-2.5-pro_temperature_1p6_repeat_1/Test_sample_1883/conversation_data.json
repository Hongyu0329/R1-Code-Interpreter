    "Of course, I can help you with this organic chemistry problem using a computational approach. Here is my step-by-step thinking process followed by the Python code to solve the task.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction**: The reaction is the thermal electrocyclic ring closure of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is an 8-π electron system.\n2.  **Apply FMO Theory**: According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, the thermal electrocyclization of a 4n-electron system (where n=2 here for 8π electrons) proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion of the terminal groups.\n3.  **Explain the Formation of Two Products**: While the primary orbital symmetry rules dictate a conrotatory mechanism, they do not fully account for steric effects in the transition state. The formation of two isomers, *cis* (A) and *trans* (B), can be explained by two competing diastereomeric conrotatory transition states:\n    *   **Pathway to *trans*-isomer B (Favored)**: The lowest energy transition state involves the two terminal methyl groups rotating outwards, away from each other. This path minimizes steric hindrance and leads to the more stable *trans* product (B).\n    *   **Pathway to *cis*-isomer A (Disfavored)**: A higher energy transition state involves the two methyl groups rotating inwards. This creates a significant steric clash between the two bulky groups, making this pathway less favorable and leading to the *cis* product (A).\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio Calculation**: The ratio of the products (A/B) is determined by the difference in activation energy (ΔE‡) between these two pathways, as described by the Arrhenius equation.\n    \n    Ratio (A/B) = exp(-ΔE‡ / RT)\n    \n    *   **ΔE‡** = E‡(*cis*) - E‡(*trans*) is the energy difference between the two transition states. This difference is primarily due to the steric clash in the path to the *cis* isomer. A reasonable estimate for this methyl-methyl interaction, which is similar to a gauche-butane interaction, is **0.9 kcal/mol**.\n    *   **R** is the ideal gas constant (1.987 cal/mol·K).\n    *   **T** is the absolute temperature. For this reaction, a typical \"thermal condition\" reported in the literature is **110 °C** (383.15 K).\n5.  **Implement in Python**: Write a Python script to calculate the ratio A/B using the values identified above and print the results, including the equation with the numerical values used.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef predict_isomer_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the ratio of cis (A) to trans (B) isomers in the thermal\n    electrocyclization of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene using\n    Frontier Molecular Orbital theory and steric considerations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define Constants ---\n\n    # The activation energy difference (dE) between the transition states\n    # leading to the cis and trans products.
