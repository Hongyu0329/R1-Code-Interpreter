# The user wants to find the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent for a specific curve in R^3.
# The curve is gamma(t) = (cos t, sin t, t), which is a non-degenerate curve in R^3.
# The dimension of the ambient space is n=3.

# The theory of l^2 decoupling for non-degenerate curves in R^n is deeply connected
# to Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem for systems of degree n. The "sharp exponent"
# in this context refers to the critical number of variables, s, in that theorem.

# The formula for this critical exponent is s = n * (n + 1) / 2.

# We will now calculate this value for n=3.
n = 3

# Calculate the exponent s using the formula.
s = n * (n + 1) / 2

# The problem requires printing out each number in the final equation.
# So we will format the output to be descriptive.
print(f"The problem concerns a non-degenerate curve in R^n, where n = {n}.")
print("The sharp l^2 decoupling exponent is given by the formula for the critical number of variables in Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem:")
