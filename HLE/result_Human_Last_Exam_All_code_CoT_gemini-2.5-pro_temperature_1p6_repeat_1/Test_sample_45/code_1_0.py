# --- Step 1: Find the relationship between focal length (f) and angular speed (ω) ---
# The height 'z' of the surface of a liquid rotating at angular speed 'ω' is given by:
# z(x) = (ω^2 / (2*g)) * x^2
# The equation for a parabolic mirror with focal length 'f' is:
# z(x) = (1 / (4*f)) * x^2
# By comparing the coefficients of x^2, we get:
# 1 / (4*f) = ω^2 / (2*g)
# Solving for f gives: f = g / (2*ω^2)
# This shows that f is proportional to 1/ω^2, or ω^-2.
# Let's define the exponent for this relationship.
exp_f_vs_omega = -2

# --- Step 2: Find the relationship between angular speed (ω) and time (t) ---
# The system is driven by a constant power source, P.
# Power is the rate of change of kinetic energy (E). For a constant power
# source starting from rest, the energy at time 't' is E = P * t.
# So, the kinetic energy E is proportional to t^1.
exp_E_vs_t = 1
# The rotational kinetic energy of the fluid is given by E = 0.5 * I * ω^2,
# where I is the moment of inertia (a constant for the cylinder).
# So, the kinetic energy E is proportional to ω^2.
exp_E_vs_omega = 2
# From E ∝ t^1 and E ∝ ω^2, we can establish a relationship between ω and t:
# ω^2 ∝ t^1  =>  ω ∝ t^(1/2)
# The exponent for the relationship between ω and t is the ratio of the energy exponents.
exp_omega_vs_t = exp_E_vs_t / exp_E_vs_omega

# --- Step 3: Combine relationships to find n for f ∝ t^n ---
# We have the two proportionalities:
# 1. f ∝ ω^(exp_f_vs_omega)
# 2. ω ∝ t^(exp_omega_vs_t)
# Substituting the second into the first:
# f ∝ [t^(exp_omega_vs_t)]^(exp_f_vs_omega)
# Using the power rule for exponents, (x^a)^b = x^(a*b):
# f ∝ t^(exp_omega_vs_t * exp_f_vs_omega)
# So, the final exponent 'n' is the product of the intermediate exponents.
n = exp_omega_vs_t * exp_f_vs_omega
