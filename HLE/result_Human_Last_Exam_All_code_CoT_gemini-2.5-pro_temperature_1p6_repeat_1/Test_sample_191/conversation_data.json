    "The user is asking a biological question, not a computational one. My plan is to first identify the relevant protein from my knowledge base of immunology and neuroscience. Then, as requested, I will provide a simple Python script that prints the name of this protein as the answer.\n\nThe protein in question is a key regulator of the innate immune system, often called the \"don't eat me\" signal. It is expressed on the surface of many cells, and when it interacts with its receptor on macrophages, it prevents phagocytosis (engulfment). Blocking this protein or its signaling pathway allows macrophages to clear targets like amyloid plaques.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the protein that inhibits\n    macrophage engulfment of amyloid. Disrupting this protein's function\n    allows for engulfment.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"CD47\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The protein that, when its signaling pathway is disrupted or 'broken down', \"\n        \"allows macrophages and microglia to engulf amyloid plaques is CD47. \"\n        \"It acts as a 'don't eat me' signal to the immune system.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n    print(f\"The protein is: {protein_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<CD47>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
