# The problem asks for the value of the limit infimum of (phi(I) * log(log(N(I)))) / N(I)
# for the affine function ring R of a global function field.
# This is a direct analogue of a classic result in number theory for integers, where
# the limit is e^(-gamma), with gamma being the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
# This result is known to hold universally for all global fields, including both
# number fields and function fields, regardless of their specific parameters
# such as genus (g), class number (h), or the characteristic (q).
# The value of the limit is e^(-gamma).

# Calculate the value of e^(-gamma)
gamma = np.euler_gamma
result = np.exp(-gamma)
