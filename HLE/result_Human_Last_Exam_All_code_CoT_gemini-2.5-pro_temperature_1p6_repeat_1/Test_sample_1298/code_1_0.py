    This function analyzes the clinical case and determines the best next step in management.
    The patient has metastatic melanoma with malignant pericardial effusion.
    The immediate life-threatening condition (tamponade) was managed with pericardiocentesis.
    The next step must address the underlying widespread cancer.

    Let's evaluate the options:
    A. Meloxicam: Symptomatic relief, doesn't treat cancer.
    B. Analgesia: Symptomatic relief, doesn't treat cancer.
    C. None of the choices: Possible, but let's check other options.
    D. Chemotherapy: A systemic treatment that targets cancer cells throughout the body. This is necessary for metastatic disease.
    E. Immunosuppression: Contraindicated. This would weaken the body's ability to fight cancer.
    F. Antibiotics: No evidence of infection.
    G. Radiotherapy: A local treatment. Not suitable for widespread metastatic disease as the primary treatment.
    H. Diuretics: Symptomatic relief for fluid overload, but doesn't address the cause (cancer producing the fluid).

    Conclusion: The patient needs systemic therapy to treat the widespread cancer. Chemotherapy is the only systemic anti-cancer therapy listed.
