    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we need to follow a standard procedure from the theory of Diophantine approximation. The \"continued fraction associated with \\( m_{p/q} \\)\" is that of a specific quadratic irrational number constructed from the rational number \\(p/q\\).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find the standard continued fraction of the rational number.** For a given rational number \\(p/q\\), we compute its continued fraction expansion. The standard form is the one that does not end with 1, i.e., \\([0; c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m]\\) with \\(c_m > 1\\).\n2.  **Construct a palindromic sequence.** We take the sequence of coefficients from the previous step, \\(C = (c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m)\\), and create a new sequence, \\(P\\), by concatenating \\(C\\) with its reverse, \\(C^R = (c_m, c_{m-1}, \\dots, c_1)\\). The resulting sequence \\(P = (C, C^R)\\) is a palindrome.\n3.  **Form the final continued fraction.** The continued fraction associated with \\(m_{p/q}\\) is a purely periodic continued fraction, written as \\([0; \\overline{P}]\\), where \\(P\\) is the palindromic sequence found in step 2.\n\nLet's apply this plan to the specific case of \\(m_{4/7}\\):\n\n1.  **Continued fraction of 4/7**:\n    Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n    \\(7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3\\)\n    \\(4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1\\)\n    \\(3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0\\)\n    The quotients are 1, 1, and 3. So, the continued fraction expansion of 4/7 is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The sequence of coefficients is \\(C = (1, 1, 3)\\). Since the last coefficient \\(3 > 1\\), this is the standard form.\n\n2.  **Construct the palindrome**:\n    The sequence is \\(C = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n    Its reverse is \\(C^R = (3, 1, 1)\\).\n    Concatenating them gives the periodic part \\(P = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)\\).\n\n3.  **Final Continued Fraction**:\n    The associated continued fraction is \\([0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]\\).\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure and prints out the numbers in the repeating part of the final continued fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_cf_coefficients(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the standard continued fraction coefficients for a rational number p/q.\n    The standard form is the one where the last coefficient is > 1.\n    The Euclidean algorithm naturally produces this form.\n    This function returns the coefficients after the integer part.\n    \"\"\"\n    if q == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero.\")\n    if p < 0 or q < 0:\n        # For simplicity, this implementation assumes positive p, q\n        raise ValueError(\"p and q must be positive.\")\n\n    coeffs = []\n    # We are interested in p/q in (0,1), so the integer part is 0.\n    # The algorithm starts with q/p.\n    num, den = q, p\n    while den != 0:\n        quotient = num // den\n        remainder = num % den\n        coeffs.append(quotient)\n        num, den = den, remainder\n    return coeffs\n\ndef compute_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Find the standard continued fraction coefficients of p/q.\n    # The coefficients C = (c_1, ..., c_m).\n    c = get_cf_coefficients(p, q)\n    print(f\"The standard continued fraction of {p}/{q} is [0; {', '.join(map(str, c))}].\")\n\n    # Step 2: Form the palindromic sequence P = (C, C^R).\n    c_rev = c[::-1]  # Reverse the list of coefficients\n    periodic_part = c + c_rev\n    \n    return periodic_part\n\n# The given rational number is 4/7\np_val = 4\nq_val = 7\n\n# Compute the periodic part of the associated continued fraction\nperiodic_coeffs = compute_markov_cf(p_val, q_val)\n\n# Step 3: Output the final result.\n# The final continued fraction is of the form [0; P] where P is the periodic part.\n# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# We interpret this as printing the numbers in the periodic part of the fraction.\nprint(\"\\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{4/7} is:\")\n# We represent the repeating part with an overline in standard notation,\n# e.g., [0; 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n# Here we just print the numbers of this repeating part.\nprint(\"Final Equation: [0; \" + \", \".join(map(str, periodic_coeffs)) + \"] (the part after the semicolon repeats)\")\nprint(\"The numbers in the periodic part are:\")\nfor number in periodic_coeffs:\n    print(number)\n\n```\n<<<(1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)>>>"
