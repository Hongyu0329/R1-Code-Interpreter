    Calculates the theoretically maximal F1 score for a cross-language KG alignment task.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The maximal F1 score in an ideal alignment task (where one-to-one mappings are
       predicted) is equivalent to the overall accuracy of alignments.
    2. A portion of relations (100-p)% are assumed to be lexically similar. An ideal
       model can use this internal information to align them with 100% accuracy.
    3. The remaining p% of relations are lexically different. Their alignment must
       rely solely on structural similarity of the graphs.
    4. The Jensen-Shannon divergence 'd' quantifies the dissimilarity of the relational
       distributions. Therefore, the structural similarity, and thus the probability
       of a successful structural alignment, is (1 - d).
    5. The total F1 score is the weighted average of success rates on these two groups.
       F1 = (1 - p/100) * 1.0 + (p/100) * (1 - d), which simplifies to F1 = 1 - (p/100 * d).
