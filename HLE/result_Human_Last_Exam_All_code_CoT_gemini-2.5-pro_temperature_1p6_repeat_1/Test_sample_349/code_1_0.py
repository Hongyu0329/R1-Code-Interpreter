    # Step 1: Define the problem from the prompt.
    # We are looking for the smallest z such that for any positive semidefinite matrix A
    # with a unit diagonal (A_ii = 1), there exist a "nice" matrix B and a
    # positive semidefinite matrix C satisfying:
    # A = z*B - C

    # Step 2: Rephrase the core condition.
    # A "correlation matrix" is a psd matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Let's call this set C_n.
    # A "nice" matrix B is a covariance matrix of unbiased +/-1 random variables.
    # This means B_ij = E[X_i * X_j] for random X_i in {-1, 1}.
    # The set of such matrices B is the convex hull of matrices xx^T (where x is a vector
    # of +/-1), known as the cut polytope N_n.
    #
    # The equation A = z*B - C is equivalent to z*B - A = C.
    # Since C must be positive semidefinite (C >= 0), the condition becomes z*B - A >= 0.

    # Step 3: Use concepts from convex optimization to find z.
    # The problem is to find the smallest z such that for any A in C_n, there exists a B in N_n
    # satisfying the condition. This means that C_n must be a subset of the set {z*B - C}.
    #
    # Using the duality of convex sets, this is equivalent to a condition on the support functions
    # of these sets. For any positive semidefinite matrix S, we must have:
    # sup_{A in C_n} <S, A> <= z * sup_{B in N_n} <S, B>
    # where <S, M> = Trace(S * M) is the matrix inner product.

    # This implies that z must be at least the ratio of these two supremum values. To hold for
    # any S, z must be the supremum of this ratio over all psd matrices S.
    # z = sup_{S >= 0} [ sup_{A in C_n} <S, A> / sup_{B in N_n} <S, B> ]

    # Step 4: Identify the constant.
    # This ratio is the definition of the (real) Grothendieck's constant, K_G.
    # - The numerator is the value of the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation for MAX-CUT.
    # - The denominator is the true optimal value for MAX-CUT.
    # K_G is the worst-case ratio between the SDP relaxation and the true value.

    # The exact value of K_G is an open problem, but its value is known to be bounded.
    # Known bounds: pi/2 <= K_G < 1.782214...
    # pi / 2 is approximately 1.5708.

    # The most accurate representation of the answer is the symbol for the constant itself.
