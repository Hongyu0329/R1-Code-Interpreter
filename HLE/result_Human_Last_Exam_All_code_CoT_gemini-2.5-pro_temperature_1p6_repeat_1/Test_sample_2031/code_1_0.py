Step 1: Identify the key metaphor. The poem states directly, "{line}". This compares the woman's eyes to opals.

Step 2: Analyze the woman's character. The poem describes a complex past involving public performance ('cheap theatricals') and hidden deeds ('fixing cards'). This reveals a character with many layers and 'long-lost secrets'.

Step 3: Analyze the symbolism of opals. Opals are gemstones known for their internal 'play-of-color'. They have a visual depth, with shifting colors that hint at a complex structure hidden beneath the surface.

Step 4: Synthesize the findings. The physical properties of an opal—its hidden depths and shifting internal colors—serve as a powerful metaphor for the woman's character. Her character is defined by its deep, multifaceted nature and the secrets it holds from her past. Therefore, the opals symbolize this profound inner complexity and secrecy.
