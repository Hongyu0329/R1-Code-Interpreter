    Analyzes the physical consequences of a hypothetical relativity theory
    based on a 4D Euclidean spacetime metric.

    The transformation equations for a velocity 'v' along the x-axis are derived
    from a rotation in the (x, t) plane and are given by:
    x' = (x - v*t) / sqrt(1 + v^2)
    t' = (t + v*x) / sqrt(1 + v^2)
