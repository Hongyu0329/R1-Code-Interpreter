    # 1. Systemic Health
    print("\n1. Systemic Health Concerns:")
    print(f"- Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus: A glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of {hba1c_level}% indicates poor glycemic control.")
    print("  This can significantly impair wound healing, increase the risk of post-procedural infections, and affect bone integration with dental implants.")
    print("- Obesity: This is often associated with other comorbidities and can be a factor in treatment planning and management.")

    # 2. Traumatic Injury
    print("\n2. Traumatic Injury Details:")
    print("- Lost Teeth: Left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar.")
    print("- Delayed Treatment: Seeking treatment {time_since_accident} hours after the incident increases the risk of infection and complicates management.")

    # 3. Cephalometric Findings
    print("\n3. Dental/Skeletal Structure:")
    print(f"- Skeletal Class III Profile: An SNB angle of {snb_angle}° (normal is ~80°) indicates a prognathic mandible.")
    print("  This affects the bite (occlusion) and is a critical factor in designing any dental prosthesis for proper function and aesthetics.")

    # --- Questions from the Prompt ---
    print("\n--- Considerations for a Treatment Plan ---")

    # 1. Specific Procedures and Cells of Interest
    print("\n1. Immediate Management & Cellular Response:")
    print("- Immediate steps would include a thorough clinical/radiographic exam, cleaning the wound, managing any soft tissue injuries, and prescribing antibiotics due to the delay and diabetic status.")
    print("- Cells of Interest: A dentist would be concerned with the activity of cells crucial for healing and fighting infection, including:")
    print("  - Osteoclasts & Osteoblasts (for bone remodeling in the tooth sockets).")
    print("  - Fibroblasts (for soft tissue/gum healing).")
    print("  - Neutrophils & Macrophages (the body's first line of defense against infection).")
    print("  - Platelets (for initial blood clot formation).")

    # 2. Prosthetic Replacement (Denture)
    print("\n2. Prosthetic (Denture) Considerations:")
    print("- This is a complex decision. A Removable Partial Denture (RPD) is a likely option given the compromised healing potential.")
    print("- Material: A flexible resin RPD could be a temporary choice. A more permanent option might be a cast metal (chrome-cobalt) framework with acrylic teeth, as it is durable and hygienic.")
    print("- Abutment Teeth: The teeth used to support the denture would likely be the left central incisor and the left second premolar.")
    print("- Abutment Rationale: Their selection depends on their own health (no fractures, good bone support, no decay). The canine is a critical tooth for function, so its replacement is a priority. These abutments provide the necessary support to restore that function.")
    print("- Note: Dental implants might be a future option, but only after the patient's diabetes is well-controlled.")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("\n--- FINAL RECOMMENDATION ---")
    print("The patient's immediate need is to stabilize her diabetic condition in consultation with a medical doctor and to get a comprehensive oral examination from a dentist or prosthodontist. The final treatment plan can only be determined after this full assessment.")
