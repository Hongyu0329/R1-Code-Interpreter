    # 1. The problem is to find a lower bound on the number of Statistical Queries (SQ)
    # for learning a specific class of neural networks.

    # 2. The final answer is a formula, not a single number, as it depends on the
    # input dimension 'd'. The formula is based on established theoretical lower bounds.

    # 3. The lower bound is of the form: base^(exponent). We define these components.
    
    # The base of the exponentiation is the dimension of the input space.
    base = "d"
    
    # The exponent is a function of the network size 'k'. Known lower bounds show
    # the exponent is at least proportional to k, written as 立(k).
    # Since the network size k is poly(d), the exponent is 立(poly(d)).
    exponent_expression = "立(poly(d))"

    # 4. We print the final formula.
    # The '立' (Omega) notation signifies a lower bound. For example, if k = d^2,
    # the number of queries would be at least d^(c*d^2) for some constant c > 0.
    # This is a super-polynomial, i.e., exponential, dependency on d.
