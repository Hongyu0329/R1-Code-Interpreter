# Plan: The problem of finding Quantum Temporal Fixed Points (QTFPs) is reduced to solving
# the algebraic equation `alpha^2 + beta^2 = alpha*beta` for a quantum state
# |P> = alpha|T> + beta|F>.
#
# Let z = alpha/beta. Dividing the equation by beta^2 gives:
# (alpha/beta)^2 + 1 = alpha/beta
# z^2 + 1 = z
# z^2 - z + 1 = 0
#
# We will solve this quadratic equation for z. The number of distinct solutions for z
# corresponds to the number of distinct QTFPs.

# Define the coefficients of the quadratic equation az^2 + bz + c = 0
a = 1
b = -1
c = 1

# To find the number of solutions, we can calculate the discriminant
discriminant = (b**2) - 4*(a*c)

# If the discriminant is non-zero, there are two distinct roots.
# We solve for the roots to be certain.
root1 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
root2 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

# A set only stores unique elements, so its length gives the number of distinct solutions.
