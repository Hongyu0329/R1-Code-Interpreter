    "To determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a Full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Count the total number of electrons ($N$)**: We sum the electrons for each atom in the molecule ($\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{Si}, \\mathrm{F}$).\n2.  **Count the total number of basis functions ($M$)**: We determine the number of basis functions contributed by each atom for the 6-31G** basis set and sum them up. The `**` notation implies adding d-type polarization functions on heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions on hydrogen atoms.\n3.  **Calculate the number of CSFs**: For a closed-shell molecule like this, we assume a singlet ground state (total spin S=0). The number of singlet CSFs can be calculated using the Weyl-Schaefer formula:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\binom{M}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{M}{N/2 - 1} \\binom{M}{N/2 + 1}$\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan, calculates the values for N and M, and then applies the formula to find the number of CSFs.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_csf():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of CSFs for a Full CI calculation of CH2SiHF\n    using the 6-31G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)\n    molecule_composition = {'C': 1, 'H': 3, 'Si': 1, 'F': 1}\n    electron_counts = {'C': 6, 'H': 1, 'Si': 14, 'F': 9}\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculating the total number of electrons (N)\")\n    total_electrons = 0\n    for atom, count in molecule_composition.items():\n        electrons = electron_counts[atom]\n        total_electrons += count * electrons\n        print(f\"  - Atom: {atom}, Count: {count}, Electrons per atom: {electrons}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of electrons (N) = {total_electrons}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (M) for 6-31G**\n    # Counts are based on standard definitions (e.g., from Basis Set Exchange)\n    basis_function_counts = {'H': 5, 'C': 15, 'F': 15, 'Si': 19}\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculating the total number of basis functions (M) for 6-31G**\")\n    total_basis_functions = 0\n    for atom, count in molecule_composition.items():\n        bfs = basis_function_counts[atom]\n        total_basis_functions += count * bfs\n        print(f\"  - Atom: {atom}, Count: {count}, Basis functions per atom: {bfs}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of basis functions (M) = {total_basis_functions}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of singlet (S=0) CSFs\n    if total_electrons % 2 != 0:\n        print(\"Error: The molecule has an odd number of electrons.
