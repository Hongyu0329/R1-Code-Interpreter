def solve_plane_problem():
    """
    Calculates the largest possible value of c for the given problem.

    The problem asks for the largest c such that the number of special points
    is always O(N^c). This value of c corresponds to the maximum possible size
    of a minimal spanning set of 2-planes in a 10-dimensional space.

    Let m be the size of a minimal spanning set of 2-planes (V_1, ..., V_m).
    Let d_k be the dimension of the subspace spanned by the first k planes,
    i.e., d_k = dim(span(V_1, ..., V_k)).

    We start with d_0 = 0.
    For the first plane, d_1 = 2.
    For subsequent planes V_k, the dimension increases according to:
    d_k = d_{k-1} + dim(V_k) - dim(span(V_1,...,V_{k-1}) intersect V_k)
    d_k = d_{k-1} + 2 - delta_k
    where delta_k is the dimension of the intersection.

    To maximize m, we need to make the dimension d_k grow as slowly as possible.
    This means we must maximize delta_k at each step. Since the set is minimal,
    V_k cannot be fully contained in the span of the previous planes, so delta_k < 2.
    Thus, the maximal possible value for delta_k is 1.

    We simulate this process to find the maximum m for which d_m = 10.
