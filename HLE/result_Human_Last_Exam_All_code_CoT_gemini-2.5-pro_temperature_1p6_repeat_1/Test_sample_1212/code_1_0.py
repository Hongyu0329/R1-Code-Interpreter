    This function solves the provided Go puzzle.

    The board state is as follows:
    Black: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    White: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5
    It's White's turn to move.

    Analysis shows that the Black group's vital points for creating two eyes are
    at A3, B2, and B1. White can kill the group by playing on the correct
    vital points.

    - White playing at B1 forces Black to respond at B2, after which White plays A3,
      destroying all eye shape. This leads to a kill.
    - White playing at A3 allows White to destroy the eye shape with a follow-up
      at B1, also leading to a kill.
    - White playing at B2 fails because Black can capture the B2 stone and then
      form a live shape.

    Therefore, the moves that initiate a killing sequence are B1 and A3.

    # Sort the moves alphabetically for a consistent output format
    killing_moves.sort()

    # Format the list into the required string output "{move1, move2, ...}"

    # the move coordinates.
