# The user wants to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the
# Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power (X) of a genus 3 Riemann surface (C).

# Define the genus of the Riemann surface C.
g = 3
# Define the degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d).
d = 15

# The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, rho(X), is determined by the
# rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, rho(Jac(C)).
# The formula is: rho(X) = 1 + rho(Jac(C)).
# We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values for rho(Jac(C))
# for a curve of genus g=3.

print(f"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^({d}) is given by the formula:")
print(f"rho(X) = 1 + rho(Jac(C)), where g = genus(C) = {g}.")
print("-" * 30)

# ---- Smallest Rank Calculation ----

# The smallest rank for rho(Jac(C)) occurs for a generic curve.
# For a generic curve, the Jacobian has only trivial endomorphisms,
# and its Neron-Severi rank is 1.
rho_jac_min = 1
smallest_rank = 1 + rho_jac_min

print("Smallest Possible Rank:")
print(f"For a generic curve, the minimum rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian is {rho_jac_min}.")
print(f"The smallest possible rank of NS(X) is therefore 1 + {rho_jac_min} = {smallest_rank}.")
print("")


# ---- Largest Rank Calculation ----

# The largest rank for rho(Jac(C)) occurs for a special curve,
# typically one with Complex Multiplication (CM).
# The maximum possible Neron-Severi rank for an abelian variety of dimension g is g^2.
rho_jac_max = g**2
largest_rank = 1 + rho_jac_max

print("Largest Possible Rank:")
print(f"The maximum rank of the Neron-Severi group of a {g}-dimensional abelian variety is g^2.")
print(f"For our case, g = {g}, so the maximum rank of NS(Jac(C)) is {g} * {g} = {rho_jac_max}.")
print(f"This maximum is achieved for certain genus {g} curves.")
print(f"The largest possible rank of NS(X) is therefore 1 + {rho_jac_max} = {largest_rank}.")
print("-" * 30)

print(f"Final Answer: The smallest rank is {smallest_rank} and the largest rank is {largest_rank}.")
