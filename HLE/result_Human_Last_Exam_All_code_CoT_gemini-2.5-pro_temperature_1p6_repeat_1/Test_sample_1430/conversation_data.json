    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a problem in algebraic geometry, specifically concerning the properties of symmetric powers of algebraic curves. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve it.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the key formula:** The core of this problem lies in a well-known result from algebraic geometry that relates the Neron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve to the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety. The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of a curve C, denoted $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = 1 + \\rho(Jac(C))$\n    Here, $Jac(C)$ is the Jacobian of the curve C. This formula holds when $d$ is at least the genus of C. In our case, the curve C has genus $g=3$ and we're looking at the 15th symmetric power, so $d=15 \\geq 3$, and the formula applies.\n\n2.  **Reframe the problem:** The formula shows that finding the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ is equivalent to finding the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, $\\rho(Jac(C))$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the smallest rank:**\n    *   For a *generic* curve C of genus $g=3$, its Jacobian, $Jac(C)$, is a simple abelian variety whose endomorphism ring is as small as possible: it's just the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The rank of the Neron-Severi group of such a Jacobian is 1. Therefore, $\\rho(Jac(C))_{min} = 1$.\n    *   Using the formula, the smallest possible rank for $X$ is $\\rho(X)_{min} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the largest rank:**\n    *   The rank of the Neron-Severi group is maximized for *special* curves, particularly those whose Jacobians exhibit complex multiplication (CM) or are isogenous to products of lower-dimensional abelian varieties with CM.\n    *   The theoretical maximum rank for the Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension $g$ is $g^2$.\n    *   For a genus 3 curve, the Jacobian is a 3-dimensional abelian variety, so the maximum possible rank is $\\rho(Jac(C))_{max} = 3^2 = 9$.\n    *   This maximum is known to be achieved. For example, the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve ($x^4+y^4=z^4=0$), which is a genus 3 curve, is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, and its Neron-Severi rank is 9.\n    *   Using the formula, the largest possible rank for $X$ is $\\rho(X)_{max} = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\n5.  **Final Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the results clearly, showing how the smallest and largest ranks are derived.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the\n# Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power (X) of a genus 3 Riemann surface (C).\n\n# Define the genus of the Riemann surface C.\ng = 3\n# Define the degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d).\nd = 15\n\n# The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, rho(X), is determined by the\n# rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, rho(Jac(C)).\n# The formula is: rho(X) = 1 + rho(Jac(C)).\n# We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values for rho(Jac(C))\n# for a curve of genus g=3.\n\nprint(f\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^({d}) is given by the formula:\")\nprint(f\"rho(X) = 1 + rho(Jac(C)), where g = genus(C) = {g}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# ---- Smallest Rank Calculation ----\n\n# The smallest rank for rho(Jac(C)) occurs for a generic curve.\n# For a generic curve, the Jacobian has only trivial endomorphisms,\n# and its Neron-Severi rank is 1.\nrho_jac_min = 1\nsmallest_rank = 1 + rho_jac_min\n\nprint(\"Smallest Possible Rank:\")\nprint(f\"For a generic curve, the minimum rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian is {rho_jac_min}.\")\nprint(f\"The smallest possible rank of NS(X) is therefore 1 + {rho_jac_min} = {smallest_rank}.\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n\n# ---- Largest Rank Calculation ----\n\n# The largest rank for rho(Jac(C)) occurs for a special curve,\n# typically one with Complex Multiplication (CM).\n# The maximum possible Neron-Severi rank for an abelian variety of dimension g is g^2.\nrho_jac_max = g**2\nlargest_rank = 1 + rho_jac_max\n\nprint(\"Largest Possible Rank:\")\nprint(f\"The maximum rank of the Neron-Severi group of a {g}-dimensional abelian variety is g^2.\")\nprint(f\"For our case, g = {g}, so the maximum rank of NS(Jac(C)) is {g} * {g} = {rho_jac_max}.\")\nprint(f\"This maximum is achieved for certain genus {g} curves.\")\nprint(f\"The largest possible rank of NS(X) is therefore 1 + {rho_jac_max} = {largest_rank}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nprint(f\"Final Answer: The smallest rank is {smallest_rank} and the largest rank is {largest_rank}.\")\n\n```\n<<<(2, 10)>>>"
