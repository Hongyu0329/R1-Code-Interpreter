    This function provides the answers to the user's questions regarding the
    superintegrability of the specified matrix model.

    The reasoning for the answers is as follows:

    For question (a): The term "superintegrability" in the context of these matrix models
    refers to the property that the partition function can be expressed as a character
    expansion (i.e., a sum over Schur functions, as given in the problem description).
    The formula for Z_{-n}(t) is, by definition, a character expansion. This property
    holds for any n >= 2, which includes the case n=3. Therefore, the matrix model
    Z_{-3}(t) is superintegrable.

    For question (b): The generation of Z_{-n}(t) can be described by the action of
    operators corresponding to the potential terms. The operator W_{-n} corresponds
    to the Tr(Phi_2^n) term. For the case n=4, there is a known identity in the
    character theory of symmetric groups which allows the character for a 4-cycle
    to be expressed in terms of characters for 2-cycles. This mathematical fact
    translates into an operator relation, meaning the operator for n=4 can be
    constructed from simpler operators associated with n=2. Consequently, a new,
    independent W_{-4} operator is not fundamentally necessary to generate Z_{-4}(t).
