    "To find the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `Z/27` is nonzero, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Ring:** The ring in question is `R = Z/27`, the ring of integers modulo 27.\n2.  **Prime Factorization:** We express the modulus in its prime power form. Here, `27 = 3^3`. So we are dealing with the ring `Z/p^k` where the prime `p = 3` and the exponent `k = 3`.\n3.  **Apply K-Theory Result:** We use a known theorem from algebraic K-theory regarding the vanishing of K-groups for rings of this form. For an odd prime `p`, the group `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` is known to be non-zero if and only if `n` satisfies the inequality `1 <= n < (p-1) * p^(k-1)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Bound:** We will substitute `p=3` and `k=3` into this inequality to find the range for `n`.\n5.  **Determine the Maximum `n`:** The largest natural number `n` will be the largest integer that satisfies the inequality derived in the previous step.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints out each step of the process.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_k_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group\n    of Z/27 is nonzero.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = 27\n\n    # Step 1: Find the prime power decomposition of m = p^k\n    # For m=27, p=3 and k=3.\n    p = 3\n    k = 3\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the largest natural number n for which K_{{2n}}(Z/{m}) is nonzero.\")\n    print(f\"The ring is Z/m where m = {m}.\")\n    print(f\"First, we write m as a prime power: {m} = {p}^{k}.\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to a theorem in algebraic K-theory, for an odd prime p,\")\n    print(f\"the K-group K_{{2n}}(Z/p^k) is nonzero if and only if:\")\n    print(f\"1 <= n < (p - 1) * p^(k - 1)\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the upper bound for n\n    term1 = p - 1\n    term2 = int(math.pow(p, k - 1))\n    upper_bound = term1 * term2\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the largest integer n and print the calculation\n    largest_n = upper_bound - 1\n\n    print(\"\\nPlugging in our values p = 3 and k = 3:\")\n    print(f\"Upper Bound = ({p} - 1) * {p}^({k} - 1)\")\n    print(f\"             = {term1} * {p}^{k-1}\")\n    print(f\"             = {term1} * {term2}\")\n    print(f\"             = {upper_bound}\")\n    print(f\"\\nSo, n must satisfy the condition: 1 <= n < {upper_bound}.\")\n    print(f\"The largest natural number (integer) n that satisfies this condition is {upper_bound} - 1.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: {largest_n}\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------\")\n\nsolve_k_group_problem()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
