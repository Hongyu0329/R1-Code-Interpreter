    print("Analyzing the choices for common imagery between Fritz Lang and William Friedkin:")

    print("\nChoice A: Aboriginal masks")
    print("Analysis: Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' opens with the discovery of a Pazuzu amulet and statue in Iraq, which are ancient Mesopotamian, not Aboriginal. This is not a known motif in Lang's films. So, A is incorrect.")

    print("\nChoice B: Magic wands")
    print("Analysis: The genres of these directors (German Expressionism, film noir, psychological thrillers) do not involve fantasy elements like magic wands. So, B is incorrect.")

    print("\nChoice C: The first ever cyborgs on screen")
    print("Analysis: Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927) famously features the Maschinenmensch, considered one of cinema's first cyborgs. However, this is a defining image for Lang, not for Friedkin, whose films do not feature cyborgs. So, C is incorrect.")

    print("\nChoice D: Bugs")
    print("Analysis: This is the correct connection.")
    print("1. William Friedkin directed the film 'Bug' (2006), a psychological horror where characters descend into madness over a supposed insect infestation.")
    print("2. In Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927), the immense crowds of workers are choreographed to move in uniform, dehumanized swarms. This powerful imagery is frequently analyzed as being insect-like, evoking the social structure of a hive or ant colony.")
    print("Thus, the concept of 'Bugs' appears as both a literal/psychological theme for Friedkin and a strong metaphorical image for Lang.")

    # The final "equation" demonstrates the reasoning that leads to the answer.
    print("\nFinal Conclusion:")
    print("Equation: Friedkin ('Bug') + Lang ('Metropolis' worker swarms) = Common Imagery: 'Bugs'")
    print("The correct choice is D.")
