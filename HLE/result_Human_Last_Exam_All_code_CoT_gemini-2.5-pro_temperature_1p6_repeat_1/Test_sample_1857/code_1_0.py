# The variables are determined by solving the riddle.
# The "widely recognized musical theme" is the number 3.

# j corresponds to works by Beethoven that are #3.
j = 3

# k corresponds to Beethoven's 3rd movement and Spears' 3rd album.
k = 3

# l is found by making Spears' single number (k+l) equal to 3.
# 3 + l = 3, so l = 0.
ell = 0

# The puzzle asks for the values of j, k, and l.
# The requested output format is a string of the numbers separated by spaces.
print(f"{j} {k} {ell}")
