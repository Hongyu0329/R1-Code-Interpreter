I would predict that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit an **enhanced capacity for cytokine release** (e.g., increased secretion of Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
