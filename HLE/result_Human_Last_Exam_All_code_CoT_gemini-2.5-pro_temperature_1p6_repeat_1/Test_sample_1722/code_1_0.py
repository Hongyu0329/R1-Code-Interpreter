    """
    Solves the POMDP memory problem by reframing it in terms of automata theory.

    The problem asks for the minimum hallway length 'n' such that a 3-state memory
    machine can outperform a 2-state machine, which in turn performs no better than a
    1-state (memoryless) machine.

    1.  The agent's goal is to distinguish between two corridors, C1 and C2, based
        on their unique n-length binary observation sequences, omega_1 and omega_2.
        A reward function can be designed to give a high reward (e.g., 1) only if the agent
        correctly identifies its corridor, and a low reward (e.g., 0) otherwise.
        Since the corridors are chosen with equal probability (0.5), a memoryless
        agent can only guess, achieving an expected reward of 0.5.

    2.  An agent with an m-state memory machine (a Deterministic Finite Automaton, or DFA)
        can achieve a perfect score (expected reward of 1) if and only if it can
        configure the machine such that the two sequences omega_1 and omega_2 lead to
        different final states. If all possible m-state machines end in the same state
        for both omega_1 and omega_2, the agent gains no information and its performance
        is identical to the memoryless agent.

    3.  The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the minimum length 'n' for which
        there exists a pair of binary strings (omega_1, omega_2) of length 'n' that:
        a) CANNOT be distinguished by any 2-state DFA. (So m=2 is no better than m=1).
        b) CAN be distinguished by some 3-state DFA. (So m=3 is better than m=1).

    4.  This is a known question in automata theory. The 'state complexity of separation'
        for strings has been studied. Key results are:
        - For any pair of distinct binary strings of equal length n <= 4, they can
          always be distinguished by a 2-state DFA.
        - The shortest pair of equal-length binary strings that requires a 3-state DFA
          to be distinguished has length 5. An example of such a pair is (00110, 10100).

    5.  Therefore, at n=5, we can define an environment (by choosing the observation
        sequences appropriately) where a 2-state memory is insufficient to improve
        upon a memoryless policy, but a 3-state memory is sufficient. For any n < 5,
        a 2-state memory is always sufficient.
