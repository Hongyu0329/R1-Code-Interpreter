    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze the number of basic operations performed as a function of the input size, `n`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Operation:** The main computational work of the algorithm happens inside the `while q > 0` loop. The total time complexity will be determined by the number of times this loop executes, multiplied by the time taken for the operations within the loop.\n\n2.  **Analyze Operations Inside the Loop:**\n    *   `i := i + 1`: One increment operation.\n    *   `x := q`: One assignment operation.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One integer division operation.\n    *   `a_i := x - qc`: One multiplication and one subtraction.\n    All these are fundamental arithmetic operations that can be considered to take constant time. Therefore, the work done in each iteration of the loop is constant, which we denote as O(1).\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   In each iteration, the variable `x` is effectively replaced by `⌊x/c⌋` for the next iteration's calculation of `q`. This means the magnitude of the number being processed decreases by a factor of `c` in each step.\n    *   Let's trace the value being divided. It starts with `n`.\n        *   After 1 iteration, the new `x` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   After 2 iterations, the new `x` is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations, the new `x` is `⌊n/c^k⌋`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `x` (the value from the previous iteration) is less than `c`, making `q = ⌊x/c⌋ = 0`. This is equivalent to finding how many times we can divide `n` by `c` until the result is less than 1.\n    *   We need to find the number of iterations, `k`, such that after `k` steps, the quotient becomes 0. This occurs when `n/c^k < 1`.\n    *   Rewriting the inequality: `n < c^k`.\n    *   To solve for `k`, we can take the logarithm of base `c` on both sides: `log_c(n) < k`.\n    *   This shows that the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. In fact, the number of iterations is exactly `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Complexity:**\n    *   Total Time Complexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Work per Iteration)\n    *   Total Time Complexity = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = O(log_c(n)).\n\n5.  **Standard Notation:** According to the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant integer greater than or equal to 2, `log(c)` is also a positive constant. In Big O notation, we disregard constant factors. Therefore, the complexity `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\nThe following Python script prints this step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef explain_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the step-by-step analysis of the time complexity for the IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Time Complexity Analysis of IMAG(n, c) ###\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify the most time-consuming part of the algorithm.\")\n    print(\"The dominant part of the algorithm is the 'while q > 0' loop.

Since c >= 2 is a constant, log(c) is also a constant.
