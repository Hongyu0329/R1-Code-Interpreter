    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Recurrence Relation**: The sequence is defined by $a_n = 88a_{n-3} + 57a_{n-4}$. We'll find the characteristic equation to understand the asymptotic behavior of $a_n$.\n2.  **Find the Roots**: The characteristic equation is $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$. By factoring this polynomial, we can find its roots. The factorization is $(x^2 - 4x - 3)(x^2 + 4x + 19) = 0$.\n    *   The roots of $x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0$ are $x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n    *   The roots of $x^2 + 4x + 19 = 0$ are $x = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\n3.  **Identify the Dominant Root**: We compare the magnitudes of the roots:\n    *   $|2 + \\sqrt{7}| \\approx 2 + 2.646 = 4.646$\n    *   $|2 - \\sqrt{7}| \\approx |2 - 2.646| = 0.646$\n    *   $|-2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (\\sqrt{15})^2} = \\sqrt{4+15} = \\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.359$\n    The root with the largest magnitude (the dominant root) is $\\lambda = 2 + \\sqrt{7}$.\n4.  **Asymptotic Behavior of $a_n$**: For large $n$, the term corresponding to the dominant root governs the growth of the sequence. Thus, $a_n \\sim C \\cdot \\lambda^n$ for some non-zero constant $C$ determined by the initial conditions. We can verify that $C$ is non-zero.\n5.  **Analyze the Sum $s_n$**: The sum $s_n$ is composed of several parts. We need to determine which part grows the fastest as $n \\to \\infty$.\n    *   $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} \\sim \\sum C \\lambda^{2k-3}$. This is a geometric series whose sum grows proportionally to its largest term, so it behaves like $\\lambda^{2n}$.\n    *   $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} (2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51}) \\sim \\sum \\lambda^{k}$. This sum grows proportionally to $\\lambda^n$.\n    *   The second sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}(\\dots)$ contains products like $a_{k+i}a_{k-j}$. The dominant term among these is $a_{k+3}a_{k-4} \\sim (C\\lambda^{k+3})(C\\lambda^{k-4}) = C^2\\lambda^{2k-1}$. Summing this up to $n-1$ results in a behavior proportional to $\\lambda^{2(n-1)} = \\lambda^{2n-2}$.\n6.  **Dominant Term of $s_n$**: Comparing the growth rates, $\\lambda^{2n}$ is the fastest growing term. Therefore, the behavior of $s_n$ is dominated by the sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3}$.\n    $s_n \\sim \\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} \\approx \\sum_{k=6}^{n} C\\lambda^{2k-3} \\sim K \\cdot \\lambda^{2n}$ for some constant $K$.\n7.  **Calculate the Limit**: Now we can compute the limit $L$:\n    $L = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(K \\lambda^{2n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(K) + 2n\\ln(\\lambda)}{n} = 2\\ln(\\lambda)$.\n    Substituting $\\lambda = 2 + \\sqrt{7}$, we get $L = 2\\ln(2 + \\sqrt{7})$.\n8.  **Final Calculation**: We need to find the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot L$. We can use Python to calculate this value precisely.\n\nThe final result is obtained by computing `floor(10000 * 2 * log(2 + sqrt(7)))`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers in the final expression\nn1 = 10000\nn2 = 2\nn3 = 2\nn4 = 7\n\n# Calculate the dominant root lambda\nlambda_val = n3 + math.sqrt(n4)\n\n# Calculate the limit L\nlimit_L = n2 * math.log(lambda_val)\n\n# Calculate the final value\nfinal_value = math.floor(n1 * limit_L)\n\n# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n# The final equation is floor(10000 * 2 * ln(2 + sqrt(7))).\nprint(f\"The expression to compute is floor({n1} * {n2} * log({n3} + sqrt({n4}))).\")\nprint(f\"The final integer result is: {final_value}\")\n```\n<<<30719>>>"
