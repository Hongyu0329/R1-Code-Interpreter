    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the overall symmetry** of the molecule to identify which parts are equivalent.\n2.  **Break down the molecule** into its main components: the central trimethylbenzene core and the three identical substituent arms.\n3.  **Count the non-equivalent proton signals** from the central core, considering its symmetry.\n4.  **Count the non-equivalent proton signals** from one of the substituent arms. This arm has a rigid, chiral structure, which will lead to non-equivalence of protons that might otherwise appear similar (diastereotopicity).\n5.  **Sum the counts** from the core and the arm to get the total number of expected peaks.\n\nThe python script below will print out this step-by-step analysis and calculate the final number of peaks.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step analysis to determine the number of\n    expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule and prints the result.\n    The term 'peak' here refers to a distinct signal or resonance for a set of\n    chemically non-equivalent protons.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum:\")\n    print(\"Molecule: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"\\n1.
