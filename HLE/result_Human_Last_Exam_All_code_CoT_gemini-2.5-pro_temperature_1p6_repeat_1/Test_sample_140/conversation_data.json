    "My plan is to solve this by determining the most efficient way to pack the 9x1x1 blocks into the 15x15x15 cube. A simple volume division (`(15*15*15) / (9*1*1)`) gives an upper limit but doesn't account for the physical constraints of fitting the shapes together.\n\nA more effective strategy is to partition the larger cube into smaller cuboids in a way that maximizes the number of perfectly packed sections. Since the block's length is 9, it's logical to partition the cube's side length of 15 into a `9-unit` section and a `6-unit` section.\n\nI will apply this `9+6` partition to all three dimensions (length, width, and height) of the 15x15x15 cube. This will divide the large cube into 8 smaller cuboids:\n1.  One `9x9x9` cuboid.\n2.  Three `9x9x6` cuboids.\n3.  Three `9x6x6` cuboids.\n4.  One `6x6x6` cuboid.\n\nThen, I will calculate the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit into each of these 8 cuboids. The final answer will be the sum of the blocks from all cuboids. The code will print out each step of this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This problem is solved by partitioning the 15x15x15 cube for optimal packing.\")\n    print(\"A side of length 15 is best split into a 9-unit part and a 6-unit part.\")\n    print(\"Applying this to all three axes divides the cube into 8 smaller cuboids.\")\n    print(\"We will now calculate the blocks for each part and sum them up.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculation for the 9x9x9 cuboid ---\n    # There is one cuboid of this size.\n    # Blocks can be oriented along any axis.\n    # Using integer division to find how many blocks fit.\n    blocks_9x9x9 = (9 // 9) * (9 // 1) * (9 // 1)\n    print(\"1.
