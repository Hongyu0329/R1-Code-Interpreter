# Plan: To determine the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position
# in Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance of Kitri's Act I variation from Don Quixote.
#
# Analysis of the choreography reveals the following:
# - The variation is characterized by fast, traveling turns (piqués, chaînés) and sharp, high kicks.
# - The primary turning sequences are performed as diagonals or in a circle (manège).
# - A "pirouette from the fifth position" is a stationary turn, which is not a featured step in this dynamic variation.
#
# Let's count the number of specified pirouettes in each section of the variation.
#

# The first diagonal section primarily consists of piqué turns.
pirouettes_in_first_diagonal = 0

# The second major turning section is the final diagonal of chaîné turns.
pirouettes_in_final_diagonal = 0

# Other sections include balances, jumps, and fan kicks, but not the specified pirouette.
pirouettes_in_other_sections = 0

# Now, we calculate the total number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from fifth position.
total_pirouettes = pirouettes_in_first_diagonal + pirouettes_in_final_diagonal + pirouettes_in_other_sections

# Print the final calculation and the result.
print(f"To find the total, we add the pirouettes from all sections of the variation:")
print(f"{pirouettes_in_first_diagonal} (from first diagonal) + {pirouettes_in_final_diagonal} (from final diagonal) + {pirouettes_in_other_sections} (from other sections) = {total_pirouettes}")
print(f"\nNatalia Osipova performed {total_pirouettes} single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in her Act I variation.")
