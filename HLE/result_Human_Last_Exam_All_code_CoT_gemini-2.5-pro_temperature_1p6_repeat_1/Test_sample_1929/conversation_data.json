    "This is a chemistry problem that can be solved by identifying the reactants and the type of reaction.\n\n1.  **Reactants Analysis**: We have butadiene (CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂) which is a conjugated diene, and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂) which is a substituted alkene, acting as a dienophile.\n2.  **Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a [4+2] cycloaddition, famously known as the Diels-Alder reaction. In this reaction, the 4 pi electrons from the diene and 2 pi electrons from the dienophile rearrange to form a new six-membered ring.\n3.  **Product Formation**: The reaction forms a cyclohexene ring. The substituents from the dienophile (two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms) will be attached to the carbons that were part of its double bond. The final product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that models this reaction using the RDKit library. The script will determine the molecular formulas of the reactants and the product, display the overall chemical equation, and, as per the instructions, print out every single digit that appears in that equation.\n\n```python\nimport re\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n    from rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit library is not installed.
