# The problem asks for the limit of the supremum of the angle of incidence alpha.
# Our step-by-step analysis shows that this limit is arcsin(1/5).

# The vertices of the triangle are 0, 5, and 5*exp(i*theta).
# The side A connects 5 and 5*exp(i*theta).
# The trajectory starts from a point x on the unit circle, |x|=1.

# Using the unfolding method for billiards, the problem simplifies.
# In the limit as theta -> 0, the maximum angle of incidence M(theta)
# approaches a value determined by the ratio of the characteristic radii
# of the geometry, which are 5 (for side A) and 1 (for the starting circle).

# The limit is given by the expression arcsin(1/5).
# We calculate the numerical value of this expression in radians.
# 1/5 = 0.2
ratio = 0.2
result_radians = math.asin(ratio)

# The question requires printing the numbers in the final equation.
# The final equation is essentially L = arcsin(1/5).
# So the numbers are 1 and 5.
numerator = 1
denominator = 5
