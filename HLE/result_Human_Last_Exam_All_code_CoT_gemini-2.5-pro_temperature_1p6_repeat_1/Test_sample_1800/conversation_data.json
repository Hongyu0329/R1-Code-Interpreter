    "Of course. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is a critical parameter determined through extensive experimental research rather than a simple calculation. It depends on the specific synthesis method and reaction conditions. However, by reviewing scientific literature, we can identify a representative value that is widely considered optimal for maximizing catalytic performance.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that:\n1.  Defines a variable for the optimal Ni/Ce molar ratio based on values reported in scientific journals for reactions like Water Gas Shift and water splitting.\n2.  Prints an explanation of what this ratio represents and why it's important.\n3.  Outputs the value in a clear, equation-like format as requested.\n4.  Provides context that this is a representative value and the true optimum can vary.\n\n```python\ndef get_optimal_catalyst_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a representative optimal Ni/Ce molar ratio for Ni-Ceria\n    catalysts based on a review of scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio is determined experimentally.
