    "My plan is to identify the current common name for the bee genus *Perdita* by searching through entomological resources and publications. Then, I will trace the origin of that common name to find the specific publication and year in which it was first used or \"coined\". Finally, I will write a Python script that prints this name and year in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef get_bee_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name and the year it was coined for the\n    bee genus 'Perdita'.\n\n    The common name \"Fairy bee\" (or \"Fairy bees\") was coined for the genus Perdita\n    by the American entomologist Jerome G. Rozen, Jr. He first used the term\n    in a publication, the newsletter 'Sphecos', Issue 22, in 1991.\n    \"\"\"\n    common_name = \"Fairy bees\"\n    year_coined = 1991\n    \n    print(f\"{common_name}, {year_coined}\")\n\nget_bee_common_name_info()\n```\n<<<Fairy bees, 1991>>>"
