    This script solves the three-part puzzle about Nabokov's "Pale Fire".
    
    Part A Reasoning: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School". The misleading tracks were made to look as if they belonged to a cow. So the answer is 6.
    
    Part B Reasoning: The central act of the novel's narrator, Kinbote, is to mislead the reader about the meaning of a poem, a form of mis-education. The allusion to a criminal trying to mislead a detective with false tracks underscores the theme of "education vs mis-education". The calculated answer is 3.

    Part C Reasoning: Nabokov's most intensive prior work involving "intricate back-referencing" was his scholarly translation and multi-volume commentary on Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin", the very structure that "Pale Fire" parodies. So the answer is 7.

    The final numbers are 6, 3, and 7.
