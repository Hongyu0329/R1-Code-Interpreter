    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Object's Hull:** The \"outer-hull\" of a non-convex polyhedron like the great icosahedron is its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Understand Triangulation:** The task is to \"triangulate\" this shape, which means to cover its surface with a minimum number of non-overlapping triangles.\n3.  **Analyze the Hull's Faces:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n4.  **Determine the Minimal Number:** Since the surface is already perfectly covered by triangles, it is already in its minimal triangulation. Any further division of these triangles would result in a higher count.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The minimal number of triangles required is simply the number of faces of a regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that states this fact and prints the final number.\n\n```python\n# The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its outer-hull,\n# or convex hull, is a regular icosahedron.\n# A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.\n# Each of these faces is an equilateral triangle.\n\n# The process of \"triangulating\" a surface means covering it with triangles.\n# Since the surface of a regular icosahedron is already made of triangles,\n# it is already triangulated in its simplest form.\n\n# Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for this triangulation\n# is simply the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n\nnumber_of_faces_of_icosahedron = 20\n\n# The final equation is simply the number of faces.\nprint(\"The minimal number of triangles needed is the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"The final number is: {number_of_faces_of_icosahedron}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
