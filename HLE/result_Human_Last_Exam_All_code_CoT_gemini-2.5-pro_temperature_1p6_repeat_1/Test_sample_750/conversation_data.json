    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we need to consider the multi-valued nature of the complex power $i^z$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Express $i^z$ using the complex logarithm**: The term $i^z$ can be written as $e^{z \\log(i)}$. The complex logarithm is multi-valued: $\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$. Thus, the equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$. We need to find solutions for every possible integer $k$.\n2.  **Let $z=x+iy$**: We substitute the Cartesian form of $z$ into the equation to get $-y+ix = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} e^{ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n3.  **Analyze for different types of solutions**:\n    *   **Real solutions ($y=0$)**: We test for real numbers $z=x$. This leads to the solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, which are independent of the branch choice $k$.\n    *   **Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**: We test for $z=iy$. This leads to the real equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$. A mathematical analysis reveals that solutions for $y$ only exist for negative integers $k$ (i.e., $k \\le -1$). For each such $k$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution. These solutions can be elegantly expressed using the Lambert W function, which is defined as the solution to $W(u)e^{W(u)}=u$.\n    *   **General complex solutions**: A more rigorous proof, which is beyond the scope of this explanation, shows that there are no other solutions with both non-zero real and imaginary parts.\n4.  **Implementation**: The Python code will first print and verify the two real solutions. Then, it will calculate and verify the first five purely imaginary solutions corresponding to $k = -1, -2, -3, -4, -5$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\nimport cmath\n\ndef solve_and_verify_complex_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for z in the complex equation z*i = i^z, prints, and verifies the solutions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The equation to solve is z * i = i^z for z in complex numbers.\")\n    print(\"This equation has two real solutions and an infinite family of purely imaginary solutions.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Real Solutions ---\n    print(\"--- Real Solutions ---\")\n    \n    # Solution 1: z = 1\n    z1 = 1 + 0j\n    lhs1 = z1 * 1j\n    # For z=1, i^1 = exp(1 * log(i)) = exp(i*(pi/2 + 2k*pi)) = i, for any integer k.\n    # cmath.pow uses the principal value for the logarithm.\n    rhs1 = cmath.pow(1j, z1) \n    print(f\"Solution 1: z = {z1.real}\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: ({z1.real}) * i = i^({z1.real})\")\n    print(f\"Verification: LHS = {lhs1:.6f}, RHS = {rhs1:.6f}.
