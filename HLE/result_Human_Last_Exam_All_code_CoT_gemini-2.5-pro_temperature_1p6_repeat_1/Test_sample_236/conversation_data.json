    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating question that lies at the intersection of knot theory and low-dimensional topology.\n\nTo solve this, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the knots:** We list all the knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). We also need to consider their mirror images if they are not amphichiral (i.e., not identical to their mirror image).\n2.  **Identify the relevant surgeries:** For a surgery on a knot to produce an integral homology sphere (a 3-manifold whose first homology group is trivial, like the 3-sphere), the surgery coefficient must be an integer p such that |p| = 1. Therefore, we only need to consider +1 and -1 surgeries.\n3.  **Identify the resulting manifolds:** For each knot and its mirror, we identify the 3-manifolds resulting from +1 and -1 surgery. These are well-known results in knot theory.\n4.  **Count the unique elements:** The set of all integral homology spheres forms a group under the connected sum operation, called the homology cobordism group Θ³_H. We will collect all the manifolds generated in the previous step and count how many are distinct as elements of this group. Some surgeries on different knots can result in the same manifold. We will use a Python script to systematically perform this count.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements from surgery on knots\n    with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This script determines how many elements of the homology cobordism group\")\n    print(\"can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify the knots and conditions for surgery.\")\n    print(\"The knots with at most four crossings are the Unknot (0_1), the Trefoil (3_1), and the Figure-eight knot (4_1).\")\n    print(\"For an integral surgery on a knot K to result in an integral homology 3-sphere,\")\n    print(\"the surgery coefficient must be +1 or -1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Use an ordered dictionary to store results and maintain order of discovery\n    # Key: manifold name, Value: source knot and surgery\n    discovered_elements = collections.OrderedDict()\n    # Use a dictionary to store the number of new elements contributed by each knot type\n    contributions = {\n        \"Unknot\": 0,\n        \"Trefoil\": 0,\n        \"Figure-eight\": 0\n    }\n\n    # === Process Unknot (0_1) ===\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyzing the Unknot (0_1)\")\n    knot_name_0_1 = \"Unknot\"\n    manifold_0_1 = \"S^3\"\n    print(f\"+/-1 surgery on the Unknot yields the 3-sphere {manifold_0_1}.\")\n    print(f\"This is the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\")\n    if manifold_0_1 not in discovered_elements:\n        discovered_elements[manifold_0_1] = \"from +/-1 surgery on the Unknot\"\n        contributions[knot_name_0_1] += 1\n    print(f\"Contribution from {knot_name_0_1}: {contributions[knot_name_0_1]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # === Process Trefoil (3_1) and its mirror ===\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Analyzing the Trefoil knot (3_1) and its mirror\")\n    knot_name_3_1 = \"Trefoil\"\n    # The Trefoil knot is chiral (not amphichiral), so we consider it and its mirror.\n    # -- Right-handed Trefoil --\n    manifold_p1_3_1_R = \"Sigma(2,3,7)\"\n    manifold_m1_3_1_R = \"Sigma(2,3,5)\"\n    print(\"For the right-handed Trefoil:\")\n    print(f\"  +1 surgery yields the Brieskorn sphere {manifold_p1_3_1_R}\")\n    if manifold_p1_3_1_R not in discovered_elements:\n        discovered_elements[manifold_p1_3_1_R] = \"from +1 surgery on the right-handed Trefoil\"\n        contributions[knot_name_3_1] += 1\n    print(f\"  -1 surgery yields the Brieskorn sphere {manifold_m1_3_1_R}\")\n    if manifold_m1_3_1_R not in discovered_elements:\n        discovered_elements[manifold_m1_3_1_R] = \"from -1 surgery on the right-handed Trefoil\"\n        contributions[knot_name_3_1] += 1\n\n    # -- Left-handed Trefoil (mirror of 3_1) --\n    # Surgery on a mirror knot gives the oriented inverse: M(mirror(K), p) = -M(K, -p)\n    manifold_p1_3_1_L = f\"-{manifold_m1_3_1_R}\" # -Sigma(2,3,5)\n    manifold_m1_3_1_L = f\"-{manifold_p1_3_1_R}\" # -Sigma(2,3,7)\n    print(\"For the left-handed Trefoil (the mirror image):\")\n    print(f\"  +1 surgery yields {manifold_p1_3_1_L} (the inverse of [{manifold_m1_3_1_R}])\")\n    if manifold_p1_3_1_L not in discovered_elements:\n        discovered_elements[manifold_p1_3_1_L] = \"from +1 surgery on the left-handed Trefoil\"\n        contributions[knot_name_3_1] += 1\n    print(f\"  -1 surgery yields {manifold_m1_3_1_L} (the inverse of [{manifold_p1_3_1_R}])\")\n    if manifold_m1_3_1_L not in discovered_elements:\n        discovered_elements[manifold_m1_3_1_L] = \"from -1 surgery on the left-handed Trefoil\"\n        contributions[knot_name_3_1] += 1\n    print(f\"Total contribution from {knot_name_3_1} and its mirror: {contributions[knot_name_3_1]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # === Process Figure-eight knot (4_1) ===\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Analyzing the Figure-eight knot (4_1)\")\n    knot_name_4_1 = \"Figure-eight\"\n    # It is a known result that +1 surgery on 4_1 gives Sigma(2,3,5)\n    manifold_p1_4_1 = \"Sigma(2,3,5)\"\n    manifold_m1_4_1 = \"-Sigma(2,3,5)\"\n    print(\"The Figure-eight knot is amphichiral (it is its own mirror).\")\n    print(f\"  +1 surgery yields {manifold_p1_4_1}.\")\n    if manifold_p1_4_1 not in discovered_elements:\n        discovered_elements[manifold_p1_4_1] = \"from +1 surgery on the Figure-eight\"\n        contributions[knot_name_4_1] += 1\n        print(\"    -> This is a new element.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"    -> This element is redundant;
