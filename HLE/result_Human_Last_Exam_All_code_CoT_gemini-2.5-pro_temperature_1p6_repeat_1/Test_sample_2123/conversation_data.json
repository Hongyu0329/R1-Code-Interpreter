    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source:** The riddle points to a specific piece of literature: a Russian translation of an essay that discusses Vienna's boulevards and mentions an English poet. This is a well-known reference.\n2.  **Pinpoint the Author and Essay:** The author is the Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky, and the essay is his famous work \"Flight from Byzantium\" (\"Путешествие из Византии\" in Russian).\n3.  **Locate the Reference:** In the essay, Brodsky describes Vienna's Ringstrasse, a large, circular boulevard. He makes a distinct and memorable comparison about its width.\n4.  **Extract the Name:** He writes that the boulevard's width is \"equal to a Tennyson hexameter.\" Alfred, Lord Tennyson was a famous English Poet Laureate.\n5.  **Final Answer:** The surname is \"Tennyson\". I will write a simple Python script to state this conclusion and print the name. The unusual instruction about printing an \"equation\" appears to be a template error for a text-based problem, so I will interpret it as a request to clearly show how the answer was derived and then print the final name itself.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the surname of an English poet found in a Russian essay about Vienna.\n\n# Step 1: The essay is \"Flight from Byzantium\" by Joseph Brodsky.\nessay = \"Flight from Byzantium\"\n\n# Step 2: The location described is a wide boulevard in Vienna, the Ringstrasse.\nlocation = \"Vienna\"\n\n# Step 3: Brodsky makes a comparison, stating the boulevard's width is \"equal to a Tennyson hexameter\".\n# From this, we can extract the poet's surname.\npoet_surname = \"Tennyson\"\n\n# Step 4: As per the instructions, we present the final answer.\n# The 'equation' here is the logical deduction: Essay + Location + Clue -> Answer.\nprint(f\"The essay '{essay}' describes a boulevard in {location}.\")\nprint(\"The clue is a comparison to a line of poetry from the poet.\")\nprint(\"The resulting surname is:\")\nprint(poet_surname)\n```\n<<<Tennyson>>>"
