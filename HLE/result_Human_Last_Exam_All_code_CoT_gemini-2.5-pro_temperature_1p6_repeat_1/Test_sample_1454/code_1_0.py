# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of components.
# We analyzed three types of solutions for the set F:
# 1. The empty set, F = {}.
# 2. A set based on the endpoints of the Cantor set, F = C_e x [0,1].
# 3. The attractor of the IFS, F = C x [0,1].

# Let's analyze the number of components for each case.
# A component is non-degenerate if it's not a single point.
# A component is locally connected if every point has a local basis of connected sets.

# Case 1: F is the empty set.
# The number of components is 0.
# The number of non-degenerate, locally connected components is therefore 0.
num_components_case1 = 0

# Case 2: F = C_e x [0,1], where C_e is the set of endpoints of the Cantor set.
# C_e is a countably infinite set.
# The components of F are vertical line segments {c} x [0,1] for each c in C_e.
# A line segment is non-degenerate and locally connected.
# The number of components is the cardinality of C_e, which is countably infinite.
num_components_case2 = math.inf # Representing countable infinity

# Case 3: F = C x [0,1], where C is the Cantor set.
# C is an uncountably infinite set.
# The components of F are vertical line segments {c} x [0,1] for each c in C.
# These components are also non-degenerate and locally connected.
# The number of components is the cardinality of C, which is uncountably infinite.
num_components_case3 = math.inf # Representing uncountable infinity

# The question asks for the smallest possible number of components.
# Comparing the possibilities {0, countable infinity, uncountable infinity}, the smallest is 0.
