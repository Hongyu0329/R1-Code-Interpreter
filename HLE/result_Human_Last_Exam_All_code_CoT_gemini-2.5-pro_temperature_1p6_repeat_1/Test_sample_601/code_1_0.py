# The reasoning implies that 4 operations are needed to reduce the heap
# back to a single tree, which is a prerequisite for the final state.
# Here's a Python code to demonstrate the calculation and print the answer.

# The number of operations derived from the step-by-step reasoning.
# 1. Insert the new root candidate.
# 2. Insert the second element of the new chain.
# 3. Insert a dummy node to trigger consolidation.
# 4. Delete-min to consolidate the heap.
num_ops = 4

# The problem is to find the smallest number of operations.
# Our analysis shows a sequence of 4 operations is the minimum to
# get back to a single tree, which is the required final configuration.
print("The proposed sequence of operations is:")
print("1. Insert(new_node_1): To be the new root of the (k+1)-chain.")
print("2. Insert(new_node_2): To be the child of the new root.")
print("3. Insert(dummy_node): A temporary node with the smallest key to enable consolidation.")
print("4. Delete-min(): To remove the dummy and consolidate all trees into a single tree.")
print(f"Thus, the smallest number of operations is {num_ops}.")
