    "To solve this problem, we will use a result from differential topology called Morse theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Introduce Morse Theory:** This theory connects the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the topological invariants of that manifold, specifically its Betti numbers.\n2.  **Define Betti Numbers:** For a given manifold, the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k$, essentially counts the number of $k$-dimensional \"holes\".\n3.  **State the Morse Inequalities:** For a Morse function (a type of \"well-behaved\" smooth function), the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, is at least the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k$. That is, $c_k \\ge b_k$.\n4.  **Calculate Betti Numbers for the Torus ($T^2$):** We will determine the Betti numbers $b_0$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ for the 2-torus.\n5.  **Apply the Inequalities:** Using the Morse inequalities, we'll find the minimum possible values for $c_0$ (local minima), $c_1$ (saddle points), and $c_2$ (local maxima).\n6.  **Sum the Results:** The minimal total number of critical points will be the sum of the minimal numbers for each index, $c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. We'll also confirm this theoretical minimum can be achieved with an example function.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_on_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus\n    using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the topology of the 2-torus (T^2) using Betti numbers.\")\n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus T^2 = S^1 x S^1\n    # b_0: number of connected components\n    b0_torus = 1\n    # b_1: number of 1D or \"circular\" holes\n    b1_torus = 2\n    # b_2: number of 2D or \"cavity\" holes\n    b2_torus = 1\n    print(f\"The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are:\")\n    print(f\"  b_0 = {b0_torus} (it's one connected piece)\")\n    print(f\"  b_1 = {b1_torus} (it has two independent loops, like latitude and longitude)\")\n    print(f\"  b_2 = {b2_torus} (it encloses one cavity)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Applying the Morse Inequalities.\")\n    print(\"Morse theory states that for a smooth Morse function on a manifold, the number\")\n    print(\"of critical points of index k (c_k) must be at least the k-th Betti number (b_k).\")\n    print(\"So, c_k >= b_k.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the 2-torus, the critical points are classified by index:\")\n    print(\"  c_0: number of local minima\")\n    print(\"  c_1: number of saddle points\")\n    print(\"  c_2: number of local maxima\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Applying the inequalities\n    min_c0 = b0_torus\n    min_c1 = b1_torus\n    min_c2 = b2_torus\n    print(f\"The minimal number of minima (c_0) must be at least b_0: c_0 >= {b0_torus}\")\n    print(f\"The minimal number of saddles (c_1) must be at least b_1: c_1 >= {b1_torus}\")\n    print(f\"The minimal number of maxima (c_2) must be at least b_2: c_2 >= {b2_torus}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Calculating the total minimal number of critical points.\")\n    print(\"The minimal total is the sum of the minimal values for each index.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the total\n    total_min_critical_points = min_c0 + min_c1 + min_c2\n    \n    # Print the final equation as requested\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Minimal total = (min c_0) + (min c_1) + (min c_2)\")\n    print(f\"              = {min_c0} + {min_c1} + {min_c2} = {total_min_critical_points}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis theoretical minimum of 4 can be achieved.
