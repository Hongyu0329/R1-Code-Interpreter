    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Total Edge Squares:** An 8x8 chessboard has four sides. I will calculate the total number of squares along the perimeter.\n2.  **Understand Bishop Placement:** The key to placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops is to remember that bishops only move on squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can never attack a bishop on a black square.\n3.  **Maximize Placed Bishops:** To place as many bishops as possible without them threatening each other, we can occupy all the edge squares of a single color. I'll determine how many edge squares are of one color. On an 8x8 board, the edge squares are evenly split between white and black (14 of each).\n4.  **Calculate Empty Squares:** The number of edge squares lacking bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the maximum number of bishops we could place.\n5.  **Generate and Print the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the step-by-step reasoning along with the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_on_edge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard after placing\n    the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An n x n board has 4 sides of n squares, but the 4 corners are counted twice.\n    # So, the formula is (n * 4) - 4.\n    total_edge_squares = (board_size * 4) - 4\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    # Bishops on white squares do not attack bishops on black squares.\n    # The edge squares of a chessboard are split evenly by color.\n    # To place the maximum number of bishops, we fill all edge squares of one color.\n    max_bishops_on_edge = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate how many edge squares are empty.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_on_edge\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final equation.\n    print(f\"First, we find the total number of edge squares on an {board_size}x{board_size} board.\")\n    print(f\"Total edge squares = ({board_size} * 4) - 4 = {total_edge_squares}\")\n    print(f\"To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can place them on all edge squares of a single color.\")\n    print(f\"Maximum bishops that can be placed on the edge = {total_edge_squares} / 2 = {max_bishops_on_edge}\")\n    print(f\"The number of edge squares lacking bishops is the total minus the number placed.\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation: {total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops_on_edge} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_on_edge()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
