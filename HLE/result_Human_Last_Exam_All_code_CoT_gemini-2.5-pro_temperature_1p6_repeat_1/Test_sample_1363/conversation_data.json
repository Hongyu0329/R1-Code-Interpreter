    "This is a knowledge-based question related to ballroom dancing technique. I will provide a Python script that models the core technical characteristics of each dance style to logically arrive at the correct answer.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the five dances from the answer choices.\n2.  For each dance, I will define its key technical properties that affect turning, specifically 'Rise and Fall' and 'Sway'. Smooth, overturned rotations heavily rely on these two techniques.\n3.  The script will then identify the dance where both 'Rise and Fall' and 'Sway' are absent, as this technical limitation makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without violating the dance's fundamental character.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the name and letter of the identified dance as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the technical characteristics of different ballroom dances\n    to determine in which one it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn\n    without disregarding the technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # In ballroom dancing, overturning a smooth turn (like a Reverse Turn)\n    # heavily relies on using Rise and Fall, and Body Sway.
