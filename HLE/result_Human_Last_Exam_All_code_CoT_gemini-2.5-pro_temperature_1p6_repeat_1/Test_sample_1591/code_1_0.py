# Step 6: Determine x_0 based on the corrected boundary condition.
# x_0^2 = 10^20
x0_2 = 10**20
# x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * x_0^2
x0_1 = math.sqrt(3) * x0_2

# Step 7: The value to be calculated is for n = 10^15, which is equivalent to n=1.
# The expression to be evaluated is (x_1^1 - s_1)^2 + (x_1^2)^2,
# where s_1 = (3*sqrt(3)*r)/(4*pi).
# We calculate the two terms inside the squares.

# term1 = x_1^1 - s_1 = -1/2 * x_0^1 - sqrt(3)/2 * x_0^2
term1 = -0.5 * x0_1 - (math.sqrt(3) / 2) * x0_2

# term2 = x_1^2 = sqrt(3)/2 * x_0^1 - 1/2 * x_0^2
term2 = (math.sqrt(3) / 2) * x0_1 - 0.5 * x0_2

# Calculate the final result
result = term1**2 + term2**2

# As shown in the derivation, the result is also equal to (x0_1)^2 + (x0_2)^2.
# Let's verify:
# result_check = x0_1**2 + x0_2**2
# The two results will be numerically identical.

# We format the output to be readable, representing 10^20 and sqrt(3) symbolically.

term2_str = f"(10^20)"

# Use floating point numbers for printing intermediate values for clarity
# Note: due to float precision, we print the symbolic form which is exact.
# term1 is -sqrt(3) * 10^20
# term2 is 10^20
