    explanation = """
The problem is to find the largest cardinality of a collection A of subsets of omega_4,
with the properties that each subset in A has size omega_4, and the intersection of
any two distinct subsets has a size strictly less than omega_4. We are given the
condition that 2^(omega_3) = omega_4.

Let |A| be the cardinality we are looking for.

1.  Upper Bound: We can prove that |A| <= omega_4.
    The proof works by contradiction. Assume |A| > omega_4. Then there is a subfamily A'
    with |A'| = omega_4^+.
    We can "color" each pair of sets {a, b} from A' with their intersection a_n_b.
    The condition is that |a_n_b| < omega_4.
    The number of possible intersection sets (colors) is the number of subsets of omega_4
    with size less than omega_4. Using the given 2^(omega_3) = omega_4, this number
    can be calculated to be omega_4.
    By the Erdos-Rado theorem, if we color the edges of a complete graph on omega_4^+
    vertices with omega_4 colors, there must be a monochromatic complete subgraph of
    size omega_4^+.
    This implies there's a subfamily A'' of size omega_4^+ where all pairs have the
    same intersection, R.
    This family A'' is a Delta-system with root R, and |R| < omega_4.
    For each a in A'', the set a' = a \\ R has size omega_4, and all these sets a'
    are pairwise disjoint.
    The union of these omega_4^+ disjoint sets, each of size omega_4, would have size
    omega_4^+. But this union must be a subset of omega_4, which has size omega_4.
    This is a contradiction (omega_4^+ <= omega_4).
    Thus, the initial assumption is false, and we must have |A| <= omega_4.

2.  Lower Bound: The bound omega_4 is sharp.
    It is a known result in set theory that such a family of size omega_4 can be
    constructed. This demonstrates that the maximum cardinality is at least omega_4.

Combining the upper and lower bounds, the largest possible cardinality for the
collection A is omega_4.

The final equation is the result |A| = omega_4.
The numbers involved in the problem description 2^(omega_3) = omega_4 are 2, 3, 4.
The number in the final answer is 4.
