# The derivation leads to a specific constant value for the lower bound 'a'.
# The value is derived from the product of the limiting values of several terms in the expression.
# The factors are (1), (-1/2), and (1/2) as shown in the step-by-step analysis.
# Or (-1), (-1/2), (-1/2) depending on the side of the limit.
# In both cases, the product is -0.25.
