    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT), `X(k)` and `H(k)`, of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We need to find the 8-point DFT, let's call it `Y(k)`, of a new 8-point sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`. The new sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Method:** Instead of calculating the inverse DFTs to find `x(n)` and `h(n)`, then forming `y(n)`, and finally computing its 8-point DFT, we can use a more direct and elegant method based on DFT properties. This approach relates the DFT of the interleaved sequence directly to the DFTs of the original sequences.\n\n3.  **Derive the Formulas:** The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be split into sums over even and odd indices of `y(n)`. The even-indexed terms `y(2n)` correspond to `x(n)`, and the odd-indexed terms `y(2n+1)` correspond to `h(n)`. This relationship leads to the following formulas, which are fundamental to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm:\n    *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n\n    These formulas apply for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`. Here, `W_8^k` is the DFT twiddle factor, defined as `exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 8)`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   Use the `numpy` library for complex number arithmetic.\n    *   Define the input arrays `X` and `H`.\n    *   Initialize an 8-element array `Y` for the result.\n    *   Loop from `k = 0` to `3`, calculating the twiddle factor `W_8^k` and applying the formulas above to compute all 8 elements of `Y`.\n    *   Finally, print each component of the resulting `Y(k)` vector as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 8-point DFT of an interleaved sequence from the\n    4-point DFTs of the original sequences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=complex)\n    H = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Initialize the 8-point DFT result array\n    N = 8\n    Y = np.zeros(N, dtype=complex)\n\n    print(\"The components of the 8-point DFT Y(k) are calculated as follows:\")\n\n    # Calculate Y(k) for k = 0 to 7\n    for k in range(N // 2):\n        # Calculate the twiddle factor W_N^k\n        twiddle_factor = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k / N)\n        \n        # Apply the formula\n        term = twiddle_factor * H[k]\n        Y[k] = X[k] + term\n        Y[k + N // 2] = X[k] - term\n\n    # Output each number in the final resulting DFT vector Y\n    # The final \"equation\" is Y(k) = value\n    for k in range(N):\n        # Format the complex number for cleaner output\n        real_part = np.real(Y[k])\n        imag_part = np.imag(Y[k])\n        \n        # Clean up floating point inaccuracies for display\n        if np.isclose(real_part, 0): real_part = 0.0\n        if np.isclose(imag_part, 0): imag_part = 0.0\n\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = {real_part:g} + {imag_part:g}j\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_dft()\n```\n<<<[1.+0.j, 1.41421356+1.j, -1.-1.j, -1.41421356-1.j, 1.+0.j, -1.41421356+1.j, -1.+1.j, 1.41421356-1.j]>>>"
