    "Phosphorus is a nonmetallic element known for having several allotropes, which are different structural forms of the same element. These allotropes exhibit distinct physical properties, including color. To determine the number of colors, we will identify the most common and stable allotropes and their corresponding colors.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  List the well-established, macroscopically stable allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Identify the distinct color of each of these allotropes.\n3.  Write a Python script to count these colors and print the result as a descriptive equation.\n\nThe primary allotropes and their colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** A waxy solid that is white or colorless when pure.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** An amorphous or polymeric form that is red.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):** A crystalline form that is violet.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** The most thermodynamically stable form, which is black with a metallic luster.\n\nThese four represent the distinct colors observed in the most common pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of common phosphorus allotropes,\n    counts them, and prints the result as an equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of distinct colors for the well-established allotropes of phosphorus\n    allotrope_colors = [\"White\", \"Red\", \"Violet\", \"Black\"]\n\n    # Calculate the total number of colors\n    num_colors = len(allotrope_colors)\n\n    # Build the equation string for display\n    equation_parts = []\n    for color in allotrope_colors:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"1 (for {color})\")\n    \n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    # Print the final equation with the total count\n    print(f\"The number of observable colors in pure phosphorus allotropes can be calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {num_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
