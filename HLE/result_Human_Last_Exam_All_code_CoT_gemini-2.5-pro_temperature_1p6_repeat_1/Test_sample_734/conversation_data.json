    "My plan is to identify the correct theologian based on the specific criteria provided in the prompt. The key requirements are:\n1.  A Christian theologian.\n2.  Developed **specialized terminology**.\n3.  The terminology can describe **changes in the laws of nature**.\n4.  The terminology is applicable to both the **virgin birth** and the **Fall**.\n\nI will search for a major figure in Christian history who dealt with philosophy, science (as it was understood in their time), and theology, particularly concerning miracles and the doctrine of creation.\n\nThe most fitting theologian is **Augustine of Hippo**. His doctrine of **\"seminal reasons\"** (*rationes seminales*) is a specific philosophical and theological terminology developed to explain how novel or miraculous events can occur within God's created order.\n\n*   **Seminal Reasons**: Augustine proposed that God, in the initial act of creation, embedded \"seeds\" or \"potentialities\" for everything that would ever come to be. Most of these unfold in a regular, predictable pattern, which we call the \"laws of nature.\"\n*   **Application to the Virgin Birth**: The virgin birth is not a violation of nature, but the activation by God of a special seminal reason that was latent within creation from the beginning. It's an event outside the *usual* course of nature, but not *contrary* to the ultimate nature God authored.\n*   **Application to the Fall**: Similarly, the negative changes to the world after the Fall (e.g., the introduction of death, toil, and suffering) can be understood as an alteration in which seminal reasons would come to fruition, changing the regular operation of the natural world from its original idyllic state.\n\nThis framework provided a sophisticated way to talk about divine action and changes in the natural order without portraying God as constantly violating his own laws.\n\nI will now write a simple Python script to output the name of this theologian.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and returns the name of the theologian\n    who developed specialized terminology for changes in natural laws,\n    applicable to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n\n    The key concept is \"seminal reasons\" (rationes seminales).\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(f\"The Christian theologian who first developed this specialized terminology was: {theologian_name}\")\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
