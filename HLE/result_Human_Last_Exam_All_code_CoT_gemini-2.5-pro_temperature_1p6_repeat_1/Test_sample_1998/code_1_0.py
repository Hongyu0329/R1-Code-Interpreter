# The user wants to find the smallest natural number N with a specific property for quadratic forms over a field K.

# Step 1: Characterize the field K.
# K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2.
# Its residue field, let's call it F, is a local field of characteristic 2.
# A local field of characteristic 2 is of the form F_q((t)), a field of formal Laurent series over a finite field F_q where q is a power of 2.
# This makes K what is known as a 2-dimensional local field. A model for K is F_q((t))((u)).
# Let d be the dimension of the local field. Here, d=2.
d = 2

# Step 2: Determine the u-invariant of K.
# The u-invariant of a field, u(K), is the maximum dimension of an anisotropic quadratic form over K.
# For a d-dimensional local field of characteristic 2, a known result states that the u-invariant is 2**(d+1).
u_invariant = 2**(d + 1)
# For our field K with d=2, u(K) = 2**(2+1) = 8.
# This implies that any quadratic form in 9 or more variables over K must be isotropic (i.e., not anisotropic).
# It also implies that there exists at least one anisotropic quadratic form of dimension 8.

# Step 3: Analyze the surjectivity of anisotropic quadratic forms over K.
# The question requires that for a given N, *every* anisotropic form in N variables is surjective (its image is the entire field K).
# Let's consider any anisotropic quadratic form Q over K. Using Springer's theorem for complete discretely valued fields,
# we can analyze the value set of Q.
# A careful analysis shows that the value set of any anisotropic quadratic form over K is not the entire field K.
# In other words, NO anisotropic quadratic form over K is surjective.
#
# Here is a sketch of the proof:
# An anisotropic form Q can be written as Q = Q1 + u*Q2 where u is a uniformizer of K,
# and the reductions q1, q2 are anisotropic over the residue field F.
# If Q1 is non-zero, the values represented by Q are constrained in a way that prevents surjectivity.
# Any unit z represented by Q must have its residue class bar(z) in the value set of q1.
# But the value set of q1 is a proper subset of the residue field F.
# So we can choose a unit z whose residue is not in the value set of q1, and this z will not be represented by Q.
# If Q1 is the zero form, then Q = u*Q2, and its values all have odd valuation, so it is not surjective.

# Step 4 & 5: Find the range of N for which the property holds.
# The property is "for every anisotropic quadratic form Q of dimension N, Q is surjective".
# From Step 3, we know that if an anisotropic form of dimension N exists, it is not surjective, so the property is FALSE.
# Therefore, the property can only be TRUE for a given N if there are NO anisotropic quadratic forms of dimension N.
# From Step 2, this happens precisely when N > u(K).
# N > 8

# Step 6: Determine the smallest such N.
# The smallest natural number N such that N > 8 is 9.
N = u_invariant + 1

# Step 7: Output the result.
print(f"The field K is a d-dimensional local field with d = {d}.")
print(f"The u-invariant of K is given by the formula u(K) = 2^(d+1).")
print(f"For d = {d}, u(K) = {u_invariant}.")
print(f"The required property holds only for N > u(K), because no anisotropic form over K is surjective.")
print(f"The smallest natural number N is u(K) + 1.")
