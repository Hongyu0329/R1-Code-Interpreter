    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Equilibrium Points**: We will find the points `(u, d)` where both `u'(t)` and `d'(t)` are zero. These are the steady states of the system.\n2.  **Analyze Stability**: We will determine the stability of these equilibrium points by linearizing the system. A separatrix is typically associated with a saddle point.\n3.  **Find the Phase Plane Equation**: We will form a differential equation for the trajectories in the `u-d` phase plane by computing `dd/du = d'(t)/u'(t)`.\n4.  **Solve for the Separatrix**: We will look for a particular solution to the phase plane equation that corresponds to a stable or unstable manifold of the saddle point. This curve will be the separatrix.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Points**:\n    *   `u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0` implies `u=0` or `u=1`.\n    *   If `u=0`, the `d'` equation becomes `d' = 2d^2 = 0`, which implies `d=0`. So, `(0, 0)` is an equilibrium point.\n    *   If `u=1`, the `d'` equation becomes `d' = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0`, which implies `d=0` or `d=-1`. So, `(1, 0)` and `(1, -1)` are equilibrium points.\n\n*   **Stability Analysis**: By computing the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluating it at each equilibrium point, we find that:\n    *   `(1, 0)` is an unstable node (a source).\n    *   `(1, -1)` is a saddle point.\n    *   `(0, 0)` is a non-hyperbolic point, requiring further analysis.\n\n*   **Phase Plane Equation and Separatrix**:\n    The separatrix is the stable or unstable manifold of the saddle point `(1, -1)`. The phase plane equation is:\n    `dd/du = (2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)) / (u^2(u-1))`\n    This is a Riccati equation. Instead of solving it generally, we can test for simple polynomial solutions of the form `d = f(u)`.\n\n    Let's test the particular solution `d = -u^2`.\n    The left-hand side is `dd/du = -2u`.\n    The right-hand side becomes:\n    `RHS = (2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)) / (u^2(u-1))`\n    `RHS = (2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3) / (u^2(u-1))`\n    `RHS = (-2u^4 + 2u^3) / (u^2(u-1))`\n    `RHS = -2u^3(u - 1) / (u^2(u-1)) = -2u`\n    Since `LHS = RHS`, `d = -u^2` is indeed a trajectory of the system.\n\n    This trajectory `d = -u^2` passes through `u=1, d=-(1)^2=-1`, which is the saddle point `(1, -1)`. It also passes through `u=0, d=0`. For `0 < u < 1`, `u'(t)` is negative, so the flow along this trajectory is from `(1, -1)` to `(0, 0)`. This curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point and serves as a separatrix for the system's dynamics in the `0 <= u <= 1` region.\n\nThe following Python code prints out the equation of this separatrix.\n\n```python\ndef find_separatrix_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the equation of the separatrix for the given system.\n\n    The separatrix is found to be an unstable manifold of the saddle point at (1, -1).\n    Analysis of the phase plane equation reveals a simple algebraic curve that represents this manifold.\n    The equation for this separatrix is d = -u^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The equation of the separatrix is d = -1 * u^2.\n    # We identify the numbers in this equation.\n    coefficient_of_d = 1\n    coefficient_of_u_term = -1\n    power_of_u = 2\n    \n    print(\"The separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors.\")\n    print(\"For the given system, a key separatrix is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (u, d) = (1, -1).\")\n    print(\"This separatrix has the following algebraic equation:\")\n    print(f\"\\nd = ({coefficient_of_u_term}) * u^({power_of_u})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nIn implicit form, with integer coefficients, the equation can be written as:\")\n    print(f\"({coefficient_of_d})*d + ({coefficient_of_d})*u^({power_of_u}) = 0\")\n\nfind_separatrix_equation()\n```\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
