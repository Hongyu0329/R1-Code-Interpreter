    This function defines the safe goal for the AI model M.

    The problem states that due to the uncomputability of the set of
    successful predictors, aiming for "predictive success" is not a safe goal.
    A safe goal must be based on information that is available and computable.

    1.  The Goal: The model should aim to improve its internal processes. "Representation learning" is the goal of learning to form better, more useful abstractions and features from input data, which in turn helps in selecting better predictors from the available hypothesis classes. This is an internal-facing and thus safer goal.

    2.  The Information Source: The model receives information about its success or failure at each discrete time step. This stream of information is computable. Therefore, the model should learn from "computable feedback".

    The completed template is "{Representation learning} from {computable feedback}".
