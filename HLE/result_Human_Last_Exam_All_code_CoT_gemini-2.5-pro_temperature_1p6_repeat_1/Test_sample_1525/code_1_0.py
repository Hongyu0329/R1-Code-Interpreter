    # Statement A Analysis:
    # The statement claims that the definition of segregation (the recursive formula for P_k)
    # is potentially not well-defined because it relies on the "order of appearance" of constants,
    # which is not a formal property of Datalog programs (which are sets of rules).
    # This is a valid critique of the provided formalism. While the final result of the segregation
    # might be proven to be order-independent, the definition of the process itself is ambiguous
    # without a specified ordering.
    # Verdict: Statement A is correct.
    correct_statements.append(True)

    # Statement B Analysis:
    # The statement questions the identity gamma[gamma^-1[P]]=P, citing order-dependence.
    # The segregation process (gamma^-1[P]) replaces constants 'c' with other constants 'c'' from their
    # pre-image. The aggregation process (gamma) maps these 'c'' back to 'c' (since gamma(c')=c).
    # This means every rule in the segregated program will be mapped back to its original form in P.
    # The result of gamma[gamma^-1[P]] will be P, regardless of any order-dependence in the segregation process.
    # Thus, the reasoning in statement B is flawed.
    # Verdict: Statement B is incorrect.
    correct_statements.append(False)

    # Statement C Analysis:
    # The statement asserts that gamma^-1[gamma[P]] might not be identical to P due to information loss.
    # For the program P given in the claim's premise, we have gamma[P] = P.
    # Therefore, the expression becomes gamma^-1[P].
    # gamma^-1[P] is the segregated, or "expanded," program. P is the original, aggregated program.
    # Except for a trivial case, these two programs are not identical. For instance, if P contains R(c) and
    # gamma^-1(c) contains c', then gamma^-1[P] would contain R(c'), which is not in the original P.
    # Verdict: Statement C is correct.
    correct_statements.append(True)

    # Statement D Analysis:
    # The statement claims the definition of gamma^-1[S₀] is ambiguous, suggesting it could mean
    # "all possible combinations" or a "single representative."
    # The recursive formula for segregation, P_{k+1} = U_{c' in ...} P_k[...], uses a union over a set of
    # all possible replacements. This explicitly defines the result as the union of all generated
    # combinations, not a single one. Therefore, the alleged ambiguity does not exist.
    # Verdict: Statement D is incorrect.
    correct_statements.append(False)
    
    # Statement E Analysis:
    # This statement provides an interpretation of the claim's equations.
    # The key equation gamma[gamma^-1[P](gamma^-1[S₀])] = P(S₀) means that computing in the refined
    # space and then abstracting the result yields the same outcome as computing in the abstract space directly.
    # This is aptly summarized as "coarse-grained inference does not make any loss of information in such a case,"
    # which is the hallmark of a sound and complete abstraction.
    # Verdict: Statement E is correct.
    correct_statements.append(True)
    
    # The total number of correct statements is the sum of the True values in the list.
