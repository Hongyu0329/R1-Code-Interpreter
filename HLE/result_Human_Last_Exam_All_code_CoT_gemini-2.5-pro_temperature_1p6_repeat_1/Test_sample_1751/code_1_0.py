def find_lipid_with_lower_surface_area():
    """
    This function determines which lipid has a lower surface area based on its chemical structure.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. C16-dihydroceramide (d18:0/16:0) has two fully saturated hydrocarbon chains. Saturated chains are straight
       and can pack together very tightly and in an ordered manner.
    
    2. C16-ceramide (d18:1/16:0) has one saturated chain and one unsaturated chain containing a trans double bond.
       This double bond introduces a rigid kink that disrupts tight packing.
       
    3. Tighter molecular packing leads to a smaller area per molecule, and thus a lower surface area when
       compressed in a monolayer.
       
    4. Therefore, C16-dihydroceramide, which packs more tightly, will have the lower surface area.
