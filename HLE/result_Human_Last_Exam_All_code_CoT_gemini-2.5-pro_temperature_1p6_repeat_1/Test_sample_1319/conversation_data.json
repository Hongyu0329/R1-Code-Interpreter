    "In Homer's Iliad, several mountains are mentioned as significant geographical landmarks or viewpoints for the gods. To determine the tallest among them, excluding the supreme Mount Olympus, we must first identify these mountains and then find their modern-day elevations.\n\nThe primary mountains mentioned are:\n*   **Mount Ida (in Phrygia, modern Turkey):** A frequent location, most notably where Zeus observes the battle.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Peak: Phengari):** From where Poseidon watches the war.\n*   **Mount Athos:** A peak Hera crosses on her journey.\n*   **Mount Pelion and Mount Ossa:** Mentioned in a simile about giants attempting to assault Olympus.\n\nBy comparing their real-world elevations, we can find the tallest. The following script will perform this comparison and provide the answer.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_tallest_iliad_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad,\n    after Mount Olympus, by comparing their elevations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of mountains mentioned in the Iliad (excluding Olympus)\n    # and their respective elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida (Turkey)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace (Greece)\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Athos (Greece)\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Pelion (Greece)\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Ossa (Greece)\": 1978,\n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of mountains mentioned in the Iliad (after Olympus):\")\n    \n    # Print each mountain and its elevation\n    # This fulfills the request to show the numbers used in the \"equation\" or comparison.\n    for mountain, elevation in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {mountain}: {elevation} meters\")\n\n    # Find the mountain with the highest elevation\n    if not mountains:\n        print(\"\\nNo mountains to compare.\")\n        return\n\n    # Using max with a key to find the entry with the highest value\n    tallest_mountain_name, tallest_mountain_elevation = max(mountains.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe tallest among these is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {tallest_mountain_elevation} meters.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_tallest_iliad_mountain()\n\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
