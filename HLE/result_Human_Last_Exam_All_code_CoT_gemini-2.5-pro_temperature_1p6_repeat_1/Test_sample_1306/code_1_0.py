# Based on the analysis of the representation theory for u_q(sl_2)
# at a primitive third root of unity, we consider a specific finite
# subcategory of indecomposable modules.

# Number of irreducible objects in this category.
# These are the simple modules L_1 and L_2.
num_irreducible = 2

# Total number of objects in this category.
# This is the count of all indecomposable submodules of projective modules.
num_total_indecomposable = 6

# Calculate the percentage.
percentage = (num_irreducible / num_total_indecomposable) * 100

# The final equation is (2 / 6) * 100.
# As requested, we print the numbers used in this equation.
