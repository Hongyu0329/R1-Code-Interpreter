    "The user wants to find the percentage of irreducible representations among all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the question**: The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ has infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (it is of \"tame\" representation type). A percentage calculation implies a finite number of objects. The most natural interpretation that leads to a finite set is to consider the representations of the \"small\" quantum group, $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, and further restrict to a specific, well-behaved finite subcategory. The small quantum group is defined by the additional relations $E^3=0, F^3=0, K^3=1$. A canonical choice for a finite subcategory is the set of all indecomposable modules that are submodules of indecomposable projective modules. For the self-injective algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, this set is well-defined and finite.\n\n2.  **Identify the indecomposable modules in this category**: For $q$ being a primitive third root of unity ($\\ell=3$), the representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is well-known.\n    *   There are two simple (irreducible) modules: $L_1$ (the trivial module, dimension 1) and $L_2$ (dimension 2).\n    *   There are two corresponding indecomposable projective modules, $P_1$ and $P_2$, which are the projective covers of $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n    *   The algebra is a Nakayama algebra, meaning all indecomposable modules are uniserial (their submodules form a single chain).\n    *   The indecomposable modules that are submodules of projectives can be found by listing all submodules of $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n\n3.  **List the modules**:\n    *   The indecomposable submodules of $P_1$ (which has Loewy series $L_1, L_2, L_1$) are $P_1$ itself, $\\text{rad}(P_1)$ (with series $L_2, L_1$), and $\\text{rad}^2(P_1) \\cong L_1$.\n    *   The indecomposable submodules of $P_2$ (which has Loewy series $L_2, L_1, L_2$) are $P_2$ itself, $\\text{rad}(P_2)$ (with series $L_1, L_2$), and $\\text{rad}^2(P_2) \\cong L_2$.\n    *   This gives a complete list of 6 distinct indecomposable modules in our considered category:\n        1.  $L_1$ (dimension 1)\n        2.  $L_2$ (dimension 2)\n        3.  A module with Loewy series $L_1, L_2$ (dimension 3)\n        4.  A module with Loewy series $L_2, L_1$ (dimension 3)\n        5.  $P_1$, with Loewy series $L_1, L_2, L_1$ (dimension 4)\n        6.  $P_2$, with Loewy series $L_2, L_1, L_2$ (dimension 5)\n    *   The total number of objects in our category is 6.\n\n4.  **Count the irreducible objects**: An object is irreducible if and only if it is simple. From our list of 6 modules, only $L_1$ and $L_2$ are simple. The other four modules have non-trivial submodules.\n    *   The number of irreducible objects is 2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the percentage**: The percentage of irreducible objects is the ratio of the number of irreducible objects to the total number of objects, multiplied by 100.\n    *   Percentage = (Number of irreducibles / Total number of indecomposables) * 100\n    *   Percentage = (2 / 6) * 100 = (1/3) * 100 = 33.333... %\n\nI will now provide the Python code to perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analysis of the representation theory for u_q(sl_2)\n# at a primitive third root of unity, we consider a specific finite\n# subcategory of indecomposable modules.\n\n# Number of irreducible objects in this category.\n# These are the simple modules L_1 and L_2.\nnum_irreducible = 2\n\n# Total number of objects in this category.\n# This is the count of all indecomposable submodules of projective modules.\nnum_total_indecomposable = 6\n\n# Calculate the percentage.\npercentage = (num_irreducible / num_total_indecomposable) * 100\n\n# The final equation is (2 / 6) * 100.\n# As requested, we print the numbers used in this equation.\nprint(\"To find the percentage, we use the following equation:\")\nprint(\"Percentage = (Number of Irreducible Objects / Total Number of Objects) * 100\")\nprint(f\"Number of Irreducible Objects: {num_irreducible}\")\nprint(f\"Total Number of Objects: {num_total_indecomposable}\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: ({num_irreducible} / {num_total_indecomposable}) * 100 = {percentage:.2f}%\")\n```\n<<<33.33>>>"
