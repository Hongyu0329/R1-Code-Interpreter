    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Weights:** The weights of the ambient projective space are given as `(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d):** The polynomial must be weighted-homogeneous, meaning every term must have the same weighted degree. We will calculate the degree of each term using the formula: `degree = a_1*w_1 + a_2*w_2 + ... + a_5*w_5` for a monomial `z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}...z_5^{a_5}`. It is common for such problems to have minor typos, so we will assume the true degree `d` is the most frequently occurring degree among all terms.\n3.  **Calculate the Sum of Weights:** We will compute the sum `S = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 + w_5`. For a Calabi-Yau manifold, this sum `S` must equal the degree `d`.\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant `c` is calculated using the formula `c = d - S`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the weights and the exponents of the monomials from the polynomial\n    # 0 = z_1^8*z_3 + z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3 + z_1*z_2^7 + z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5 + z_2*z_3^4 + z_4^3*z_5 + z_5^3\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    exponents_list = [\n        [8, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # z_1^8*z_3\n        [4, 3, 1, 0, 0],  # z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3\n        [1, 7, 0, 0, 0],  # z_1*z_2^7\n        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5\n        [0, 1, 4, 0, 0],  # z_2*z_3^4\n        [0, 0, 0, 3, 1],  # z_4^3*z_5\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]   # z_5^3\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the weighted degree for each monomial\n    degrees = []\n    for exponents in exponents_list:\n        degree = sum(e * w for e, w in zip(exponents, weights))\n        degrees.append(degree)\n\n    # For the polynomial to be well-defined, it must be weighted-homogeneous.\n    # We assume the degree 'd' is the most common degree among the terms,\n    # accounting for potential typos in the input polynomial.\n    if not degrees:\n        d = 0\n    else:\n        degree_counts = collections.Counter(degrees)\n        d = degree_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the sum of the weights\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant\n    invariant = d - sum_of_weights\n\n    # Output the result in the specified equation format\n    weight_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n    print(f\"The degree of the polynomial is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The sum of the weights is S = {weight_sum_str} = {sum_of_weights}.\")\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is calculated as c = d - S.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{d} - ({weight_sum_str}) = {invariant}\")\n\n    # Return the final numerical answer\n    return invariant\n\n# Run the calculation and store the result\nresult = calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```"
