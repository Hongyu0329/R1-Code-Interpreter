    This function outlines the result from applying the Poincare-Lindstedt method

    # 1. Background
    # The problem is to find the 3rd term of the nonlinear frequency correction for the
    # bubble oscillation described by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.
    # We use the Poincare-Lindstedt perturbation method. The analysis leads to an expression
    # for the second-order correction to the squared frequency, omega_2.
    # The linear frequency squared is omega_0^2 = 3*gamma.

    # 2. Result of the Perturbation Analysis
    # The first frequency correction, omega_1, is found to be 0.
    # The second frequency correction, omega_2, is found to be:
    # omega_2 = (3*gamma / 8) * P(gamma)
    # where P(gamma) is a polynomial in gamma.
    
    # 3. The Polynomial P(gamma)
    # The derivation shows that the polynomial P(gamma) is:
    # P(gamma) = -6*gamma^2 + 3*gamma + 2
    
    # The question asks for the "3rd term" of the nonlinear correction.
    # The most direct interpretation is that it refers to the third term
    # of this key polynomial, P(gamma), when written in standard form.

    # 4. Extracting the terms of the polynomial
    # The equation for the polynomial can be written as:
    # P(gamma) = (-6)*gamma^2 + (3)*gamma + (2)
    
    # We identify the terms based on their order:
    # Term 1: -6*gamma^2
    # Term 2: 3*gamma
    # Term 3: 2
    
    # Let's print the numerical parts of the polynomial equation as requested.
    print("The key polynomial for the frequency correction is P(gamma) = a*gamma^2 + b*gamma + c.")
    print("The coefficients and the constant term are:")
    a = -6
    b = 3
    c = 2
    print(f"a = {a}")
    print(f"b = {b}")
    print(f"c = {c}")

    # 5. Final Answer
    # The third term of the polynomial is the constant term.
    third_term = c
    
    print("\nThe 3rd term of the nonlinear correction, as interpreted from the polynomial P(gamma), is:")
