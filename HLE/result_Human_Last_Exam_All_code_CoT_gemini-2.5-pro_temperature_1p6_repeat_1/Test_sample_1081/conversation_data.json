    "To determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we will follow a clear mathematical result.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Leverage Steinberg's Theorem:** A fundamental theorem by Robert Steinberg states that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots in the root system corresponding to $G$.\n2.  **Identify the Root System:** For a group $G$ of type $E_8$, the relevant root system is the $E_8$ root system.\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Positive Roots (N):** The main part of the task is to find the number of positive roots for $E_8$. I will do this by calculating the total number of roots and then dividing by two. The total number of roots can be calculated from the well-known geometric description of the $E_8$ root lattice.\n    *   The roots of $E_8$ reside in an 8-dimensional space and consist of two types of vectors.\n    *   I will calculate the count for each type and sum them to get the total number of roots.\n    *   The number of positive roots, $N$, is half of this total.\n4.  **Provide the Final Answer:** Once $N$ is found, the final answer will be the expression $q^N$.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that programmatically performs the calculation of $N$ and prints the step-by-step reasoning leading to the final answer, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_e8_positive_roots():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of positive roots for the E_8 root system.\n    \n    The E_8 root system is defined in an 8-dimensional Euclidean space.
