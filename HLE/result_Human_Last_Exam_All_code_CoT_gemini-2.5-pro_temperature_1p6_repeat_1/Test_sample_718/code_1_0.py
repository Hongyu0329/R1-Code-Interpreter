# The problem asks for the value of n for which a tame functor is n-resolvable.
# Based on the analysis of homological properties of tame algebras, especially
# the connection to tilted algebras which have a global dimension of at most 2,
# the value for n is determined to be 2.

# Assign the determined value to the variable n.
n_value = 2

# The final equation is n = 2.
# The prompt requests to output each number/symbol in the final equation.
equation_variable = "n"
equation_symbol = "="
equation_value = n_value

# Print the final equation to the console.
print(f"{equation_variable} {equation_symbol} {equation_value}")
