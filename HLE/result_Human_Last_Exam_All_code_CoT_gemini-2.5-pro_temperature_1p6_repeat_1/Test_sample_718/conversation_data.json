    "In this problem, we are asked to find the integer `n` for which a tame functor `f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K` is `n`-resolvable, where `J` is an upper semilattice. To solve this, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Interpret the terminology**: I will first clarify the meaning of the terms \"upper semilattice\", \"tame functor\", and \"n-resolvable\" in the context of representation theory.\n    *   A representation of a poset `J` is a functor `f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K`, which assigns a vector space to each element of `J` and a linear map to each relation. The category of these representations is equivalent to the module category of the incidence algebra `KJ`.\n    *   An object `f` being **n-resolvable** is a homological property, typically meaning that its projective dimension is at most `n` (i.e., `pd(f) \\leq n`). This means there exists a projective resolution of length `n`.\n    *   A representation type is **tame** if the indecomposable representations in any given dimension can be classified by a finite number of one-parameter families. The term **tame functor** is interpreted as an indecomposable representation that belongs to one of these families (often called a \"regular\" module), for a poset `J` whose incidence algebra `KJ` is of tame representation type but not finite type.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Homological Algebra**: The question asks for a universal bound `n` on the projective dimension of these \"tame functors\".\n    *   The global dimension of an incidence algebra `KJ` is not universally bounded; for example, if `J` is a chain of length `d`, the global dimension is `d-1`, and `d` can be arbitrarily large. However, such algebras are of finite representation type. The question's focus on \"tame functors\" suggests we should consider algebras of tame-infinite type.\n    *   In the theory of tame algebras, a large and important class are the **tilted algebras**. These are formed by \"tilting\" a module over a hereditary algebra (which has global dimension â‰¤ 1). A key result is that any tilted algebra has a global dimension of at most 2.\n    *   Many tame algebras arising from posets are either tilted algebras or closely related to them. While not every tame incidence algebra is a tilted algebra, the homological behavior of their regular modules is expected to be constrained. The bound on the global dimension for tilted algebras provides a strong candidate for `n`.\n\n3.  **Conclude the value of n**: Based on the connection between tame representation type and tilted algebras, the upper bound for the relevant projective dimensions is 2. Therefore, a tame functor is expected to be 2-resolvable.\n\nI will now write a Python script to present this result. The code will state the final equation `n = 2` and print its components as requested.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the value of n for which a tame functor is n-resolvable.\n# Based on the analysis of homological properties of tame algebras, especially\n# the connection to tilted algebras which have a global dimension of at most 2,\n# the value for n is determined to be 2.\n\n# Assign the determined value to the variable n.\nn_value = 2\n\n# The final equation is n = 2.\n# The prompt requests to output each number/symbol in the final equation.\nequation_variable = \"n\"\nequation_symbol = \"=\"\nequation_value = n_value\n\n# Print the final equation to the console.\nprint(f\"{equation_variable} {equation_symbol} {equation_value}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
