    # Part (a) Answer
    # The condition does not guarantee symmetry for all j >= 2.

    # Part (b) Answer
    # Let w = x . 1_R.
    # For j=2, q=-1, the k=1 term is 0 because the q-binomial coefficient is 0.

    # The expression is w^3 * Sum_{k=0 to 3} [coefficient_k * (g^k a . 1_R)].
    # The coefficients are calculated from the general formula.
