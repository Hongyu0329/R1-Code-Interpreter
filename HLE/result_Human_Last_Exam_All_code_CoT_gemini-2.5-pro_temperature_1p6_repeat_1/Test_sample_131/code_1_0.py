    This function analyzes the provided text and determines the correct answer choice.

    The core logic is as follows:
    1. The "self-stabilizing effect" is driven by the awareness of "knowledge gaps".
    2. Awareness of knowledge gaps requires a foundational understanding of the subject.
    3. The "late learning phase" is defined by "comprehensive knowledge", which represents the strongest possible foundation.
    4. Therefore, a learner in the late phase can perceive the most knowledge gaps, causing the effect to peak at this stage.
    5. This reasoning directly supports choice C.
