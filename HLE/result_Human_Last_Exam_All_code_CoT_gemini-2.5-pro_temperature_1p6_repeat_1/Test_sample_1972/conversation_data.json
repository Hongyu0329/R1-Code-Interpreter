    "My plan is to identify the source of the specific quote attributed to Jorge Luis Borges and cross-reference it with his commentary on authors he viewed in relation to William Faulkner.\n\n1.  **Search for the quote:** I will search for the phrase \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" in connection with Jorge Luis Borges. This will likely lead to a specific essay, review, or prologue he wrote.\n2.  **Identify the subject:** The source found in step 1 will name the novel and author that Borges was describing.\n3.  **Confirm the Faulkner connection:** I will verify that Borges described this same author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n4.  **Synthesize and present:** I will combine this information into a Python script that prints the answer in a clear, descriptive text.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's literary query.\n    It identifies the novel and author based on Jorge Luis Borges's specific praise.\n    \"\"\"\n    novel_title = \"The Tunnel (El túnel)\"\n    author_name = \"Ernesto Sabato\"\n    quote_fragment_1 = \"the intensity of a tiger\"\n    quote_fragment_2 = \"the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"\n    comparison_author = \"Faulkner\"\n\n    print(f\"The novel Jorge Luis Borges praised is '{novel_title}' by the Argentine writer {author_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Borges wrote the prologue for the novel, in which he said it possesses \\\"{quote_fragment_1}\\\" and \\\"{quote_fragment_2}.\\\"\")\n    print(f\"He described its author, {author_name}, as a continuator (and simplifier) of {comparison_author}, admiring how he handled dark, psychological themes in a more direct and classical manner.\")\n\nfind_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<The Tunnel (El túnel) by Ernesto Sabato>>>"
