def solve_mis_complexity():
    """
    This function analyzes the complexity of the described randomized MIS algorithm
    for three different classes of graphs and determines which complexity category
    they fall into.

    The algorithm is a variant of Luby's algorithm. Its complexity is well-studied.
    The number of synchronous rounds required for it to terminate with high probability (1 - 1/n)
    is analyzed for three graph classes:
    1. A cycle of length n.
    2. Any tree on n vertices with degree at most 100.
    3. Any graph on n vertices of degree at most 100.

    Analysis:
    - For general graphs with maximum degree Delta, the algorithm's runtime is O(log n).
      Since Delta is a constant (100), this bound holds.
    - A path of length n provides a lower bound. It has been proven that the algorithm
      takes Omega(log n) rounds on a path.
    - A path is a valid graph in all three specified classes (it's a cycle minus an edge,
      it's a tree, and it's a general graph with Delta=2).
    - Therefore, for all three graph classes, the Omega(log n) lower bound from the path
      instance applies.
    - Combining the general O(log n) upper bound with the Omega(log n) lower bound,
      the complexity for all three cases is Theta(log n).

    Mapping to Categories:
    The categories are:
    1: O(1)
    2: o(log* n)
    3: Theta(log* n)
    4: o(log log n)
    5: Theta(log log n)
    6: O(log^0.1(n))
    7: O(log^0.9(n))
    8: o(log n)
    9: Omega(log n)

    A function that is Theta(log n) fits into the category Omega(log n).
    It does not fit into any of the o(log n) categories (1-8).
    So, for all three functions f1(n), f2(n), and f3(n), the correct category is 9.
