    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The number of logical qubits, `k`, determines the GSD as `2^k`. Holes in the surface act as boundaries and modify the topology, thus changing the number of logical qubits.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct formula:\n\n1.  **Base Manifold**: The name \"toric code\" originates from its initial and most-studied formulation on a torus (a surface with genus `g=1`). On a simple, closed torus (with no holes), there are `k=2g=2` logical qubits, leading to a GSD of `2^2=4`. A toric code on a sphere (`g=0`) is trivial, with GSD=1. Therefore, it's standard to assume the base manifold is a torus (`g=1`) unless specified otherwise.\n\n2.  **Effect of Holes (Boundaries)**: Holes introduce boundaries. The properties of the toric code depend on the type of boundary.\n    *   **Smooth holes**: These are boundaries where Z-type string operators can terminate.\n    *   **Rough holes**: These are boundaries where X-type string operators can terminate.\n    The number of logical qubits `k` on a surface of genus `g` with `d` boundaries *of a single type* is given by the formula `k = 2g + d - 1` (for `d > 0`).\n\n3.  **Mixed Boundary Types**: The problem specifies `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, meaning we have mixed boundary types. Let's analyze this case on a torus (`g=1`).\n    *   If we naively apply the formula above with `d = n+m`, we would get `k = 2(1) + (n+m) - 1 = n+m+1`. This result (`GSD = 2^(n+m+1)`) is not among the answer choices, suggesting this simple formula does not apply to mixed boundary conditions.\n    *   The presence of both smooth and rough boundaries can introduce new relationships between logical operators. When both boundary types exist, it's argued that a new constraint arises that links the logical operators associated with the torus handles to those associated with the boundaries. This constraint effectively removes one logical qubit from the system compared to the single-boundary-type case.\n    *   Therefore, the number of logical qubits becomes `k = (n+m+1) - 1 = n+m`.\n\n4.  **Final Formula**: Based on this reasoning, the number of logical qubits is `k = n+m`. The ground space degeneracy is `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`. This matches option A. This formula holds under the assumption that we are on a torus and have at least one of each type of hole (`n>0`, `m>0`). While more complex piecewise formulas exist for all cases of `n` and `m`, this is the most direct fit to the provided options.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the GSD using this formula for user-defined `n` and `m`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a torus\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or not isinstance(m, int) or n < 0 or m < 0:\n        print(\"Error: The number of holes (n and m) must be non-negative integers.\")\n        return\n\n    # The number of logical qubits k is n + m.\n    # The ground space degeneracy is 2^k.\n    exponent = n + m\n    degeneracy = 2**exponent\n\n    # Print the equation with the specific numbers, as requested.\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy is 2^({n} + {m}) = {degeneracy}\")\n\n# Example usage with n=2 smooth holes and m=3 rough holes.\nn_smooth_holes = 2\nm_rough_holes = 3\ncalculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n_smooth_holes, m_rough_holes)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
