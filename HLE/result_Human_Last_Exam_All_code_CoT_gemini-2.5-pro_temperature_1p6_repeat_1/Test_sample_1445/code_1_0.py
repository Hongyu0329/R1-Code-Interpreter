def calculate_n():
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of operations n needed to transform any given 
    initial 100-digit binary sequence into any target 100-digit binary sequence.

    This function implements the logic derived from the analysis:
    1. An upper bound for the number of operations is min(n0(S)+n0(T), n1(S)+n1(T)).
    2. We find the maximum value of this upper bound across all possible sequences S and T.
    3. The number of blocks k = n0 + n1 is at most 100.
    4. The maximum of min(n0S+n0T, n1S+n1T) occurs when n0S, n1S, n0T, n1T are all high.
    5. Worst case: S = "01"*50 and T = "10"*50.
       - n0(S) = 50, n1(S) = 50
       - n0(T) = 50, n1(T) = 50
    6. The value is min(50+50, 50+50) = 100.
