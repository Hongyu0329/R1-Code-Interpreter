# Step 1: Define the set of elements known in elemental form during the Odyssey's era
# (excluding zinc and antimony as specified).
known_elements = {'Carbon', 'Sulfur', 'Copper', 'Silver', 'Gold', 'Iron', 'Tin', 'Lead', 'Mercury'}

# Step 2: Define the set of elements mentioned in the Odyssey.
# - Gold, Silver, Iron are frequently mentioned.
# - Copper is mentioned extensively as bronze ('chalkos').
# - Tin is a component of bronze and mentioned as decoration.
# - Lead is mentioned in similes for weight.
# - Sulfur ('theion') is used by Odysseus to purify his hall.
# - Carbon is present as charcoal for fires and soot.
mentioned_elements = {'Gold', 'Silver', 'Iron', 'Copper', 'Tin', 'Lead', 'Sulfur', 'Carbon'}

# Step 3: Find the elements that were known but not mentioned by taking the difference between the two sets.
not_mentioned_elements = known_elements - mentioned_elements

# Step 4: Print the result in an equation-like format.
