    "To find the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixels that lie on the line. Then, we can find the pixel in the middle of the resulting sequence.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Implement Bresenham's Algorithm**: We'll calculate all the pixel coordinates for the line segment from (1, 1) to (11, 5).\n    *   The change in x (`dx`) is 10, and the change in y (`dy`) is 4.\n    *   Since `dx > dy`, we will iterate along the x-axis, incrementing x by 1 at each step, and decide whether to increment y based on a decision parameter.\n2.  **Store Pixel Coordinates**: As the algorithm generates each pixel, we will add its coordinates to a list.\n3.  **Find the Central Pixel**: The line consists of `dx + 1 = 11` pixels. The central pixel will be the one at the middle index of our list (`11 // 2 = 5`, since we use 0-based indexing).\n4.  **Output the Result**: The script will print the list of all pixels on the line and then identify and print the coordinates of the central one.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel_bresenham(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the pixels for a line using Bresenham's algorithm\n    and returns the central pixel.
