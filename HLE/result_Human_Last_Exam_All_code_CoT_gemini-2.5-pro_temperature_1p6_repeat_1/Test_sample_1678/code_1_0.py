# Step 1: Define given parameters
s_hr = 2160  # Saturation flow rate, veh/hour
R_d = 56     # Displayed red time, seconds
Y = 3        # Displayed yellow time, seconds
AR = 2       # All-red time, seconds
g = 30       # Effective green time, seconds
t_L = 4      # Total lost time, seconds
v_hr = 600   # Approach average flow rate, veh/hour
perc_green_arrivals = 0.40 # 40% of traffic arrives during effective green
perc_red_arrivals = 0.60   # 60% of traffic arrives during effective red

# Step 2: Determine cycle characteristics
# Total lost time t_L = start-up lost time (l1) + clearance lost time (l2)
# Assume clearance lost time is the all-red time.
l2 = AR
l1 = t_L - l2

# Effective green time g = Displayed Green (G_d) + Yellow (Y) - start-up lost time (l1)
# So, G_d = g - Y + l1
G_d = g - Y + l1

# Cycle length C = G_d + Y + AR + R_d
C = G_d + Y + AR + R_d

# Effective red time r = C - g

# Step 3: Calculate rates in vehicles per second and vehicles per cycle

# Vehicles arriving during red and green
N_red = N_total * perc_red_arrivals

# Step 4: Calculate total delay per cycle using the queueing diagram area method
# Maximum queue is the number of vehicles that arrive during the red interval
Q_max = N_red

# Delay accumulated during the effective red time (Area of the first triangle)
# Area = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * r * Q_max
delay_red = 0.5 * r * Q_max

# Time required to clear the queue during the effective green period
# Dissipation rate = saturation flow rate - arrival rate during green
dissipation_rate = s_s - lambda1
time_to_clear_queue = Q_max / dissipation_rate

# Delay accumulated during the green period until queue clears (Area of the second triangle)
# Area = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * time_to_clear_queue * Q_max
delay_green_clearance = 0.5 * time_to_clear_queue * Q_max

# Total delay per cycle is the sum of the two delay components
D_total = delay_red + delay_green_clearance

# Step 5: Calculate the average delay per vehicle
# Average delay = Total Delay / Total Vehicles
avg_delay = D_total / N_total
