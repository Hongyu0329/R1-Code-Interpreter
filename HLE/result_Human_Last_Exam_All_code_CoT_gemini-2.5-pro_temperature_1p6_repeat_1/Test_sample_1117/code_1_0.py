    print("  - Reactant 1: Ce2@C80. This is an endohedral fullerene, meaning two Cerium (Ce) atoms are trapped inside a cage of 80 carbon atoms.")
    print("  - Reactant 2: 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1,2-disilirane. This is a molecule that will react with the fullerene cage.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 2: Characterize the reaction type.")
    print("  - The disilirane is too large to enter the fullerene cage. Therefore, the reaction occurs on the outside of the cage.")
    print("  - This is called an 'exohedral functionalization'. The disilirane adds across a C=C double bond on the C80 cage surface.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Determine the effect on the fullerene and the internal atoms.")
    print("  - Before the reaction, the two Ce atoms move relatively freely inside the symmetrical cage.")
    print("  - The addition of the bulky disilirane group to the outside breaks the cage's symmetry.")
    print("  - This creates a defined molecular axis. The positions directly opposite the point of addition and the point itself can be considered 'poles'.")
    print("  - The internal Ce atoms are no longer in a symmetrical environment. To find the new lowest energy state, they move to fixed positions.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 4: Conclude the final position of the Cerium atoms based on published research.")
    print("  - X-ray crystallography studies on the product of this reaction show that the Ce2 dimer aligns with the new axis created by the external group.")
    print("  - This alignment places the two Cerium atoms at the polar positions of the now-asymmetric fullerene cage.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 5: Evaluate the given options.")
    print("  - A, B: Incorrect. The reaction is with the outer cage, not the inner Ce atoms.")
    print("  - C: Incorrect. The reaction restricts the motion of the Ce atoms.")
    print("  - D: Incorrect. The atoms move to the poles, not the equator.")
    print("  - E: Correct. The cerium atoms are now positioned at the poles of the fullerene.")
