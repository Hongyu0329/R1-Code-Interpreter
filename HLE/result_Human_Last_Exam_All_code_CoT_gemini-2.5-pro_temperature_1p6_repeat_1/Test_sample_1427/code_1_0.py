    Analyzes the question based on Edmund Husserl's phenomenological concepts.

    In Husserl's philosophy, the "theoretical interest" of phenomenology is directed
    towards understanding the essential structures of our experience in the "life-world"
    (Lebenswelt). This is contrasted with our "natural attitude," which is our everyday,
    practical engagement with the world.

    1.  The understanding of the pencil as an object for writing (B) is how we
        primarily experience the pencil in our natural attitude. It is an object
        defined by its function and purpose within our life-world.

    2.  The understanding of the pencil as an object made from wood (A) is a
        more abstract, scientific view. Husserl considered this scientific attitude
        a derivative of the natural attitude, one that brackets the pencil's
        lived meaning in favor of its physical properties.

    3.  Husserl's "theoretical interest" does not discard the lived, practical
        meaning. Instead, it makes that very meaning its object of study. The
        phenomenologist reflectively investigates what it means for something
        to be perceived *as* a tool for writing. The function is central to the
        essence of the object as it appears to consciousness.

    Therefore, the understanding of the pencil as an object for writing (B) is the
    primary data and central concern for the phenomenological theoretical interest.
