    "An A($\\alpha$)-stable method has its stability region containing the angular sector $S_\\alpha = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. For the BDF methods of order greater than 2, the stability region is the exterior of a lobe in the right-half complex plane. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the ray from the origin that is tangent to this unstable lobe.\n\nThe boundary of this lobe for BDF4 is given by the curve\n$q(\\theta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j} (1 - e^{-i\\theta})^j$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nThe condition for a ray from the origin to be tangent to this curve is that the argument of $q(\\theta)$ is at an extremum, which means $\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\arg(q(\\theta)) = 0$. This leads to a polynomial equation for $x = \\cos(\\theta)$. For BDF4, this equation is:\n$18x^3 - 9x^2 - 11x + 2 = 0$.\n\nThe angle of the tangent ray, let's call it $\\phi$, is given by $\\phi = \\arg(q(\\theta_0))$ where $\\cos(\\theta_0) = x_0$ is the relevant root of the polynomial. The A-stability angle $\\alpha$ is this angle $\\phi$. So we have $\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\text{Im}(q(\\theta_0))}{\\text{Re}(q(\\theta_0))}\\right)$.\n\nWe can express the real and imaginary parts of $q(\\theta)$ in terms of $x = \\cos\\theta$:\n- $\\text{Re}(q(x)) = 2x^4 - \\frac{16}{3}x^3 + 4x^2 - \\frac{2}{3}$\n- $\\text{Im}(q(x)) = \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\left(-2x^3 + \\frac{16}{3}x^2 - 5x + \\frac{8}{3}\\right)$\n\nThe following Python code will solve the polynomial for $x_0$, then substitute this value into the expressions for the real and imaginary parts of $q$ to find the angle $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_bdf4_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the exact A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the polynomial for x = cos(theta)\n    # 18*x**3 - 9*x**2 - 11*x + 2 = 0\n    coeffs = [18, -9, -11, 2]\n    \n    # Find the roots of the polynomial\n    roots = np.roots(coeffs)\n    \n    # The relevant root for the maximum angle is the largest real root in [-1, 1]\n    # which is approximately 0.86438\n    x0 = max(r.real for r in roots if np.isreal(r) and -1 <= r.real <= 1)\n    \n    # Expression for the real part of q(x)\n    Re_q = 2*x0**4 - (16/3)*x0**3 + 4*x0**2 - 2/3\n    \n    # Expression for the imaginary part of q(x)\n    # We take the positive square root for the angle in the first quadrant\n    sin_theta = np.sqrt(1 - x0**2)\n    Im_q_div_sin = -2*x0**3 + (16/3)*x0**2 - 5*x0 + 8/3\n    Im_q = sin_theta * Im_q_div_sin\n    \n    # The angle alpha is arctan(Im(q)/Re(q))\n    tan_alpha = Im_q / Re_q\n    alpha_rad = np.arctan(tan_alpha)\n    \n    # --- Printing the exact value expression ---\n    x_sym = sp.Symbol('x0')\n    re_q_sym_str = f\"2*({x_sym})**4 - (16/3)*({x_sym})**3 + 4*({x_sym})**2 - 2/3\"\n    im_q_sym_str = f\"sqrt(1 - ({x_sym})**2) * (-2*({x_sym})**3 + (16/3)*({x_sym})**2 - 5*({x_sym}) + 8/3)\"\n\n    print(\"The A(alpha)-stability angle for BDF4 is given by alpha = arctan(Im(q)/Re(q)),\")\n    print(\"where q is evaluated at a specific theta_0, whose cosine x0 is a root of the polynomial:\")\n    print(\"18*x0**3 - 9*x0**2 - 11*x0 + 2 = 0\")\n    print(f\"The relevant root is x0 = {x0:.10f}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The components of q(x0) are:\")\n    print(f\"Re(q(x0)) = 2*({x0:.4f})**4 - (16/3)*({x0:.4f})**3 + 4*({x0:.4f})**2 - 2/3 = {Re_q:.10f}\")\n    print(f\"Im(q(x0)) = sqrt(1 - ({x0:.4f})**2) * (-2*({x0:.4f})**3 + (16/3)*({x0:.4f})**2 - 5*({x0:.4f}) + 8/3) = {Im_q:.10f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The final equation for the angle alpha (in radians) is:\")\n    print(f\"alpha = arctan({Im_q:.10f} / {Re_q:.10f})\")\n    print(f\"alpha = arctan({tan_alpha:.10f})\")\n    print(f\"alpha = {alpha_rad:.10f}\")\n\nsolve_bdf4_angle()\n```\n<<<1.2792623912>>>"
