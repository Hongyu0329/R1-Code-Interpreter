    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the characters provided in the answer choices and their roles and motivations within the film *Solaris*.\n\n1.  **Kris Kelvin:** The main protagonist, a psychologist sent to the Solaris space station. A key theme of his character arc is his deep, nostalgic connection to Earth and his past, which is contrasted with the alien and sterile environment of the station. His memories and dreams are often of his home, his father, and the natural world.\n2.  **Hari:** A \"visitor\" or \"guest,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's deceased wife. She is a product of the Solaris ocean and Kris's memories, not a person with her own memories of Earth.\n3.  **Snaut:** A cyberneticist on the station. He is cynical and jaded from his time in space but also philosophical. He acts as a guide for Kris.\n4.  **Sartorius:** A stoic and scientific-minded biologist. He is focused on studying Solaris and is largely detached from earthly or emotional concerns.\n5.  **Gibarian:** A friend of Kris who was on the station but committed suicide before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video recording.\n\nThe feeling of missing the natural sounds of Earth is a powerful symbol of homesickness and the human condition. This sentiment is most strongly associated with the main character, Kris Kelvin, who explicitly grapples with his longing for Earth and feels shame over missing such simple things amidst the grand cosmic mystery of Solaris. A specific dialogue in the film confirms this.\n\nTherefore, Kris is the correct answer. I will now generate a Python script to present this finding.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and explains the character from the 1972 movie 'Solaris'\n    who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character in question is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin.\n    # His nostalgia for Earth is a central theme of the film.\n    # In a poignant dialogue, he expresses his deep-seated longing for the simple,\n    # natural experiences of his home world, feeling a sense of shame that he misses\n    # these \"trivial\" things more than he desires cosmic exploration.\n\n    correct_choice = \"A\"\n    character_name = \"Kris\"\n\n    print(\"Question: In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie Solaris which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth?\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(f\"The character is Kris Kelvin. Throughout the film, he is overwhelmed by a powerful nostalgia for Earth.\")\n    print(\"This longing is not for grand concepts but for simple, sensory experiences like the rain, his home, and the sound of rustling leaves.\")\n    print(\"He feels a sense of shame about this, as if humanity's earthly attachments are a weakness when faced with the vastness of the cosmos.\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is {correct_choice}, {character_name}.\")\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
