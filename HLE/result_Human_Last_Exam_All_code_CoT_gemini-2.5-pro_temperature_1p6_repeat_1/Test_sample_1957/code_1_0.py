# The problem asks for the minimum value of 1000*m + n.
# Based on the analysis of the underlying algebraic geometry, the set S is
# described by a single polynomial of degree 6.
# This polynomial is known to have a determinantal representation as a 6x6 matrix
# whose entries are polynomials of degree 2.

# Therefore, we have:
# n = the size of the matrix
n = 6
# m = the maximum degree of the polynomial entries in the matrix
m = 2

# The expression to minimize is 1000*m + n
result = 1000 * m + n
