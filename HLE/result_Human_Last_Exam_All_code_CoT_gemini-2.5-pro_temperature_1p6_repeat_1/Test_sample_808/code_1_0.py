def find_non_planar_graphs():
    """
    This function identifies which Platonic solids become non-planar after a specific modification.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Define the five Platonic solids, which are the graphs fitting the user's description.
    2. Store their properties: number of vertices (V) and edges per face (k).
    3. Order them by V to assign labels 1 through 5.
    4. For each graph, check the result of the modification. The modification turns a face with k vertices into a complete graph K_k.
    5. A graph containing a K_5 subgraph is non-planar. Thus, if k >= 5, the graph becomes non-planar.
    6. Print the analysis for each graph and the final list of labels.
