    "To find the radical for the character 謄, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Analyze the structure of the kanji 謄.\n2.  Identify its radical component. The character can be split into a left side (月) and a right side (朕). In this structure, the left-side component is typically the radical.\n3.  The radical is 月. When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (編), and its name is \"tsukihen\" (つきへん).\n4.  Convert the name \"tsukihen\" into its Hepburn transcription, which is \"Tsukihen\".\n5.  Finally, I will create a simple Python script to print this name, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The Japanese character in question is 謄.\n# This character is composed of a left part and a right part.\n# The left part is the radical, which is 月.\n# When the radical 月 is on the left side of a character, it is known as a \"hen\" (へん).\n# The Japanese name for this radical form is つきへん (tsukihen).\n# This script will print the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n\nradical_name_hepburn = \"Tsukihen\"\nprint(radical_name_hepburn)\n```\n<<<Tsukihen>>>"
