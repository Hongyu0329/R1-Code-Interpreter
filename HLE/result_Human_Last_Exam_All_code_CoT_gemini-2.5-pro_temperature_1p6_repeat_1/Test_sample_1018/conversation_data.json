    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.** For an oriented, closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 1$, its simplicial volume is given by $||\\Sigma_g|| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g-2)$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface individually.**\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$ (with $g_1 = 31$): $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 2(2 \\times 31 - 2) = 120$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$ (with $g_2 = 17$): $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 2(2 \\times 17 - 2) = 64$.\n\n3.  **Use the product formula for simplicial volume.** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ with dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product is:\n    $||M \\times N|| = \\binom{m+n}{n} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$\n    Here, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$. Both are surfaces, so their dimension is 2. Thus, $m=2$ and $n=2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the binomial coefficient.**\n    $\\binom{m+n}{n} = \\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6$.\n\n5.  **Combine the results.**\n    $||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_simplicial_volume_product(g1, g2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dimension of a surface is 2\n    m = 2\n    n = 2\n\n    # Step 1: Check if genera are valid for the formula ||Σg|| = 2(2g-2)\n    if g1 < 1 or g2 < 1:\n        # A surface of genus 0 (a sphere) has simplicial volume 0.\n        # This code assumes g >= 1 as per the problem.\n        if g1 < 1:\n            sv1 = 0\n        if g2 < 1:\n            sv2 = 0\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate simplicial volume for each surface\n    # ||Σg|| = 2 * |χ(Σg)| = 2 * (2g - 2) for g >= 1\n    sv1 = 2 * (2 * g1 - 2)\n    sv2 = 2 * (2 * g2 - 2)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient C(m+n, n)\n    # For two surfaces, this is C(2+2, 2) = C(4, 2)\n    binomial_coefficient = math.comb(m + n, n)\n\n    # Step 4: Apply the product formula: ||M x N|| = C(m+n, n) * ||M|| * ||N||\n    total_sv = binomial_coefficient * sv1 * sv2\n\n    # Print the explanation and final result\n    print(\"The formula for the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface Σ_g (for g≥1) is ||Σ_g|| = 2(2g - 2).\")\n    print(f\"For g₁ = {g1}, the simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g1}|| = 2(2*{g1} - 2) = {sv1}.\")\n    print(f\"For g₂ = {g2}, the simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g2}|| = 2(2*{g2} - 2) = {sv2}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe product formula for simplicial volumes is ||M × N|| = C(m+n, n) * ||M|| * ||N||.\")\n    print(f\"Here, m=2 and n=2, so the binomial coefficient is C(4, 2) = {binomial_coefficient}.\")\n    print(\"\\nPutting it all together, the final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"||\\u03A3_{g1} \\u00D7 \\u03A3_{g2}|| = {binomial_coefficient} \\u00D7 {sv1} \\u00D7 {sv2} = {total_sv}\")\n\n# Genera of the surfaces\ngenus1 = 31\ngenus2 = 17\n\ncalculate_simplicial_volume_product(genus1, genus2)\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
