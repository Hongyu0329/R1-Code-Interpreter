    "To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the smallest square that can completely enclose the given parametric curve. This is equivalent to finding the area of the smallest square that encloses the bounding box of the figure.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the curve's extent:** We'll determine the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates of the curve.\n    *   The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$. As `t` varies from 0 to $2\\pi$, the value of $\\cos t$ ranges from -1 to 1. Thus, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The y-coordinate is defined in two parts:\n        *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$. The values range from 0 to 1.\n        *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5 \\sin t$. The values range from -5 to 0.\n    *   Combining these, the overall range for the y-coordinate is from -5 to 1. Thus, $y_{min} = -5$ and $y_{max} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box:**\n    *   The width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values: $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   The height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values: $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n3.  **Determine the side of the enclosing square:** The smallest square that can enclose this rectangular bounding box must have a side length equal to the larger of its width and height.\n    *   Side length $s = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the area:** The area of the square is the square of its side length.\n    *   Area $= s^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the final area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the minimum and maximum coordinates of the curve.\n# For x = cos(t), as t goes from 0 to 2*pi, the range is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\n\n# For y, we have two cases:\n# Case 1: t in [0, pi], y = sin(t). Range is [0, 1].\n# Case 2: t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5*sin(t). Range is [-5, 0).\n# The combined range for y is [-5, 1].\ny_min = -5\ny_max = 1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the width and height of the figure's bounding box.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\nprint(f\"The range of x is [{x_min}, {x_max}], so the width is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The range of y is [{y_min}, {y_max}], so the height is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\n# The side length must be the maximum of the width and height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height, which is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length ** 2\n\nprint(f\"The area of the square is side * side = {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}.\")\n```\n<<<36>>>"
