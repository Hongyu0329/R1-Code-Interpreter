# Step 1: Define the minimum and maximum coordinates of the curve.
# For x = cos(t), as t goes from 0 to 2*pi, the range is [-1, 1].
x_min = -1
x_max = 1

# For y, we have two cases:
# Case 1: t in [0, pi], y = sin(t). Range is [0, 1].
# Case 2: t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5*sin(t). Range is [-5, 0).
# The combined range for y is [-5, 1].
y_min = -5
y_max = 1

# Step 2: Calculate the width and height of the figure's bounding box.
width = x_max - x_min
height = y_max - y_min

print(f"The range of x is [{x_min}, {x_max}], so the width is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.")
print(f"The range of y is [{y_min}, {y_max}], so the height is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.")

# Step 3: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.
# The side length must be the maximum of the width and height.
side_length = max(width, height)

print(f"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height, which is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.")

# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.
area = side_length ** 2

print(f"The area of the square is side * side = {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}.")
