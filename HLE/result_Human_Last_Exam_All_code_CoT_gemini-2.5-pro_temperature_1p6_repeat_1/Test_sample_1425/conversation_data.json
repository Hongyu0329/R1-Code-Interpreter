    "To determine the partition function Z for a system with the grand canonical Hamiltonian H' = H - μN using path integrals, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Start with the definition**: The grand canonical partition function is defined as the trace of the density matrix, Z = Tr[exp(-βH')], where β is the inverse temperature and H' = H - μN is the grand canonical Hamiltonian.\n2.  **Introduce the Path Integral**: We will express this trace as a path integral over a set of fields (e.g., complex scalar fields ψ for bosons). This method involves summing over all possible configurations of the fields in imaginary time.\n3.  **Formulate the Euclidean Action**: The path integral is weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action, `exp(-S_E)`. We need to derive the form of `S_E` corresponding to our Hamiltonian H'. In the imaginary time formalism (where time `t` is replaced by imaginary time `τ = it`), the action for a system described by a Hamiltonian K takes the general form `S_E = ∫dτ [ ∫d³x π(∂_τ)φ - K ]`.\n4.  **Construct the Final Expression**: By substituting our grand canonical Hamiltonian `H' = H - μN` into the general form, we can find the specific Euclidean action for this system. This will give us the final path integral expression for Z.\n5.  **Present the result**: A Python script will be used to print the final mathematical formula in a clear, formatted way, explaining each term involved in the equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the path integral expression for the grand canonical partition function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using Unicode characters for mathematical symbols to improve readability.\n    integral_symbol = \"\\u222B\"\n    beta_symbol = \"\\u03B2\"\n    tau_symbol = \"\\u03C4\"\n    mu_symbol = \"\\u03BC\"\n    psi_star_symbol = \"\\u03C8*\"\n    psi_symbol = \"\\u03C8\"\n    partial_tau_symbol = \"\\u2202_\" + tau_symbol\n    hbar_symbol = \"\\u0127\"\n    nabla_squared_symbol = \"\\u2207\\u00B2\"\n    \n    # Define the components of the equations.\n    # We describe the fields as functions of space (x) and imaginary time (tau).\n    field_vars = f\"({', '.join(['x', tau_symbol])})\"\n    psi_star_full = f\"{psi_star_symbol}{field_vars}\"\n    psi_full = f\"{psi_symbol}{field_vars}\"\n    \n    # The partition function Z is a functional integral over the fields.\n    path_integral_measure = f\"{integral_symbol} D[{psi_star_symbol}] D[{psi_symbol}]\"\n    partition_function_z = f\"Z = {path_integral_measure} exp(-S_E)\"\n    \n    # The Euclidean action S_E is an integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian L_E.\n    # For a general single-particle Hamiltonian operator H_op, the action is:\n    integrals_s_e = f\"{integral_symbol}\\u2080^{beta_symbol} d{tau_symbol} {integral_symbol} d\\u00B3x\"\n    lagrangian_content = f\"{psi_star_full} [ {partial_tau_symbol} + H_op - {mu_symbol} ] {psi_full}\"\n    euclidean_action_s_e = f\"S_E = {integrals_s_e} ( {lagrangian_content} )\"\n\n    # --- Printing the final result ---\n    print(\"The path integral representation for the grand canonical partition function Z is given by the following equations:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"\\n1.
