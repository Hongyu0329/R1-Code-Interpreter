  Analyzes the statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect ones.

  A. Correct. This is a standard definition of attack graphs and their analysis.
  B. Correct. The state explosion problem is a well-known challenge, leading to exponential complexity.
  C. Correct. Attack graph generation is a hard problem. Certain formulations are proven to be PSPACE-complete, which implies they are also NP-hard.
  D. Correct. Systems change, so attack graphs must be updated. Incremental computation is the practical solution.
  E. Correct. Formal verification using techniques like model checking is a primary application of attack graphs.

  Since all statements are correct, the answer is 'N'.
