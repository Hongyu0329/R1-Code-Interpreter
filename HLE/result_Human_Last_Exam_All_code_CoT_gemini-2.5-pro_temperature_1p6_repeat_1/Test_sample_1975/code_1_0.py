# The problem is a deep question in combinatorial set theory.
# The solution relies on reasoning about properties of large cardinals
# and specialized forms of Fodor's Lemma and the Delta-System Lemma.

# Step 1: Identify the main cardinal kappa.
# kappa is defined as omega_7. In the aleph notation, this is aleph_7.
# The index 'n' for omega_n is 7.
kappa_index = 7

# Step 2: Determine which cardinals mu are in the set X.
# Based on the reasoning outlined above:
# - It is possible to construct a free set of size mu for any infinite cardinal mu < kappa.
# - It is not possible to construct a free set of size kappa.

# The infinite cardinals are aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, ...
# We are looking for mu such that mu is an infinite cardinal and mu < kappa (aleph_7).
# These cardinals are:
# aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3, aleph_4, aleph_5, aleph_6.

# Step 3: Count the number of such cardinals.
# The set X contains aleph_i for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
# The number of elements in this set is 7.
number_of_cardinals_in_X = kappa_index

# The order type of a well-ordered set like X is its cardinality.
order_type = number_of_cardinals_in_X

# The problem asks for the order type of X.
# Our analysis concludes this value is 7.
print("The set X contains the infinite cardinals mu such that mu < kappa = omega_7.")
print("These cardinals are Aleph_0, Aleph_1, Aleph_2, Aleph_3, Aleph_4, Aleph_5, Aleph_6.")
cardinal_list = [f"Aleph_{i}" for i in range(7)]
print(f"The elements of X are: {cardinal_list}")
print(f"The number of elements in X is {len(cardinal_list)}.")
print(f"Therefore, the order type of X is {order_type}.")
# Final equation as requested:
print(f"Final Result: The order type is {order_type}")
