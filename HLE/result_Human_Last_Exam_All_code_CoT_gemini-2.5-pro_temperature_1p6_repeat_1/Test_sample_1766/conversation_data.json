    "Of course. Here is a Python script to solve for the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. As it's an electron, its spin quantum number is $s=1/2$.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, is obtained by coupling $l$ and $s$. The possible values for $j$ range from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$ in integer steps.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j):** For each value of $j$, the magnetic quantum number, $m_j$, can take on values from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:** The eigenvalues for the operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ are given by $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$ and $\\hbar m_j$, respectively. For simplicity, we will work in atomic units where $\\hbar=1$.\n5.  **Code and Print:** The script will iterate through all possible states (defined by $j$ and $m_j$) and print the corresponding eigenvalues, showing the numbers used in the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \n    A p-electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 and\n    spin quantum number s=1/2.\n    \"\"\"\n    l = 1\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron, l = {l} and s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"We will find the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z, where J = L + S.\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues are calculated in atomic units (h_bar = 1).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Find the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    # j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps.\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    # Step 2: For each j, find the possible m_j values and calculate eigenvalues.\n    for j in j_values:\n        # m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps.\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        # Eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For the states with total angular momentum quantum number j = {j}:\")\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is j*(j+1) = {j} * ({j} + 1) = {j_squared_eigenvalue}\")\n        print(\"The corresponding eigenvalues of J_z for each m_j are:\")\n        \n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            # Eigenvalue of J_z is m_j\n            j_z_eigenvalue = m_j\n            print(f\"  For m_j = {m_j:<4.1f}, the J_z eigenvalue is {j_z_eigenvalue:.1f}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 50)\n\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<For a p-electron, l = 1 and s = 0.5.\nWe will find the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z, where J = L + S.\nThe eigenvalues are calculated in atomic units (h_bar = 1).\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nFor the states with total angular momentum quantum number j = 0.5:\nThe eigenvalue of J^2 is j*(j+1) = 0.5 * (0.5 + 1) = 0.75\nThe corresponding eigenvalues of J_z for each m_j are:\n  For m_j = -0.5, the J_z eigenvalue is -0.5\n  For m_j = 0.5 , the J_z eigenvalue is 0.5\n--------------------------------------------------\nFor the states with total angular momentum quantum number j = 1.5:\nThe eigenvalue of J^2 is j*(j+1) = 1.5 * (1.5 + 1) = 3.75\nThe corresponding eigenvalues of J_z for each m_j are:\n  For m_j = -1.5, the J_z eigenvalue is -1.5\n  For m_j = -0.5, the J_z eigenvalue is -0.5\n  For m_j = 0.5 , the J_z eigenvalue is 0.5\n  For m_j = 1.5 , the J_z eigenvalue is 1.5\n--------------------------------------------------\n>>>"
