    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. I will use the `numpy` library in Python, as it is highly optimized for matrix operations.\n\n1.  First, I will define the matrix `A` as a `numpy` array.\n2.  Then, I will use the `numpy.linalg.det()` function to calculate the determinant.\n3.  To fulfill the request of showing the calculation, I will also print out the standard formula for a 3x3 determinant and substitute the values from the given matrix to illustrate the steps of the calculation.\n4.  Finally, I will print the computed determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\nprint(\"The given matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nTo compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\")\nprint(\"[[a, b, c],\")\nprint(\" [d, e, f],\")\nprint(\" [g, h, i]]\")\nprint(\"We use the formula: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\\n\")\n\n# Extract the elements of the matrix for the formula\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Show the formula with the numbers from matrix A\nprint(\"Substituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\ncalc_str = f\"det(A) = {a}(({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b})(({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c})(({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\"\nprint(calc_str)\n\n# Calculate each term\nterm1_val = e*i - f*h\nterm2_val = d*i - f*g\nterm3_val = d*h - e*g\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a}({term1_val}) - ({b})({term2_val}) + ({c})({term3_val})\")\n\n# Calculate the final result\nfinal_result = a*term1_val - b*term2_val + c*term3_val\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a*term1_val} - ({-b*term2_val}) + ({c*term3_val})\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a*term1_val} + {b*term2_val} + {c*term3_val}\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {final_result}\")\n\n# Verify with numpy's function and print the final result\ndeterminant = np.linalg.det(A)\nprint(f\"\\nThe final computed determinant is: {determinant}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.0>>>"
