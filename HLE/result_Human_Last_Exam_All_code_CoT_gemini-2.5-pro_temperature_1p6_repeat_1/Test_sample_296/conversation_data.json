    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, we can count them by separating them into two types: normal and non-normal subgroups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Count normal subgroups of index 4:** A normal subgroup `H` of index 4 implies the quotient group `G/H` has order 4. Since the Grigorchuk group `G` is a 2-group (every element's order is a power of 2), `G/H` must also be a 2-group. The only groups of order 4 are the cyclic group `C_4` and the Klein four-group `V_4`. We will show that `G/H` can only be `V_4` and then count how many such subgroups exist. This number is equivalent to the number of surjective homomorphisms from `G` to `V_4`.\n\n2.  **Count non-normal subgroups of index 4:** For a non-normal subgroup `H` of index 4, we consider its normal core, `K = core(H)`. The quotient `G/K` acts faithfully and transitively on the 4 cosets of `H`, meaning `G/K` must be isomorphic to a transitive subgroup of `S_4`. Since `H` is not normal, `K` is a proper subgroup of `H`, so the index of `K` must be greater than 4. The only transitive 2-subgroup of `S_4` with order greater than 4 is the dihedral group `D_4` (order 8). We will count the number of such subgroups `H` by first finding the number of possible normal subgroups `K` and then, for each `K`, counting the number of corresponding subgroups `H`.\n\n3.  **Sum the results:** The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the counts from the two cases.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan and calculates the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We will calculate the number of subgroups of index 4 by splitting them into two types:\n# normal and non-normal subgroups.\n\n# Part 1: Normal subgroups of index 4\n# A normal subgroup H of index 4 means the quotient group G/H has order 4.\n# Since the Grigorchuk group G is a 2-group, G/H must be a 2-group: either C_4 or V_4.\n# G cannot have C_4 as a quotient because this would require a surjective homomorphism\n# from its abelianization G_ab = (C_2)^3 to C_4, which is impossible as the image\n# of any element from (C_2)^3 must have order dividing 2.\n# Thus, any normal subgroup of index 4 must have a quotient isomorphic to V_4 (C_2 x C_2).\n# The number of such subgroups is the number of surjective homomorphisms from G to V_4,\n# which equals the number of surjective linear maps from (F_2)^3 to (F_2)^2.\n\n# Calculation for surjective maps from (C_2)^3 to (C_2)^2:\n# A map is defined by where it sends the 3 basis vectors of the domain.
