    "To solve this, we need to consult Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles for a 100BB rake-free cash game. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The user specifies an open-raise from the button (BTN). The BTN is the most profitable position in poker, allowing for the widest opening range. The game being \"rake-free\" is a critical detail, as it makes marginal hands more profitable to play compared to a standard game where the house takes a rake from each pot.\n\n2.  **Define \"Worst Hand\":** In a GTO strategy, you should raise all hands that have a positive expected value (+EV). The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest EV that is still profitable (i.e., just above 0 EV). Any hand with a lower EV should be folded.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Suited Jacks:** Suited hands are valuable because they can make flushes. Hands with a Jack are strong because the Jack is a high card. The value of a suited Jack hand (JXs) primarily depends on its kicker (the X). A higher kicker provides better straight potential (connectivity) and a better two-pair potential. Therefore, the value of suited Jacks decreases as the kicker gets lower. The order of strength is: JTs > J9s > ... > J4s > J3s > J2s.\n\n4.  **Determine the Cutoff:** The weakest possible suited Jack is J2s. The question is whether this hand is a profitable open-raise in this specific scenario. In many standard charts for *raked* games, J2s is a fold. However, in a *rake-free* environment, the profitability threshold is much lower. Given the power of being in position on the button and the frequency of winning the blinds pre-flop without a fight, even a hand as weak as J2s becomes a profitable open-raise. Since J2s has the lowest EV of all suited Jacks, it is the correct answer for the \"worst\" one you should still open.\n\n```python\n# Define the components of the poker hand.\n# The hand is a suited Jack, and we need to find the lowest kicker\n# that is still a profitable open-raise from the button in a rake-free game.\n\nhigh_card = 'J'\n# Based on GTO principles for a rake-free game, the range is wide enough\n# to include the lowest possible kicker.\nlow_card_value = 2\nsuit = 's'\n\n# Construct the abbreviated hand name.\nhand_abbreviation = high_card + str(low_card_value) + suit\n\n# The \"equation\" for forming the hand is simply concatenating the parts.\n# The prompt requires showing the numbers in the final equation.\nprint(f\"Equation for the hand: '{high_card}' + '{low_card_value}' + '{suit}'\")\nprint(f\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {hand_abbreviation}\")\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
