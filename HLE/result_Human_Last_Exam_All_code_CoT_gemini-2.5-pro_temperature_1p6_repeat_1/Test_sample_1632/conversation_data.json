    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will solve the problem by implementing a recursive backtracking algorithm. This approach systematically explores all possible paths of length `n` starting from an origin point `(0,0)` on a 2D grid.\n\nThe core of the algorithm is a function that, at each step of the walk, tries to move in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). A move is valid only if it leads to a point that has not been visited before in the current path. When a path reaches the desired length of `n=10`, it is counted as one valid self-avoiding walk.\n\nTo make the computation faster, I will use a symmetry optimization. The number of walks starting with a step to the right is the same as starting up, down, or left. Therefore, I can calculate the number of walks for just one initial direction (e.g., to the right) and then multiply that result by 4 to get the total number of walks.\n\nThe final code will calculate `a(10)` and print the equation used for the final calculation, showing all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's good practice to increase the recursion limit for deep recursion,\n# though n=10 is shallow enough for default limits.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\ndef count_walks(current_pos, steps_left, visited):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks from a given position.\n\n    Args:\n        current_pos (tuple): The (x, y) coordinates of the current position.\n        steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n        visited (set): A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited positions.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have successfully found one complete walk.\n    if steps_left == 0:\n        return 1\n\n    x, y = current_pos\n    total_walks = 0\n\n    # The four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice.\n    moves = [(0, 1),  # Up\n             (0, -1), # Down\n             (1, 0),  # Right\n             (-1, 0)] # Left\n\n    # Explore each possible move.\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n        # A move is valid if the next position has not been visited yet.\n        if next_pos not in visited:\n            # Mark the new position as visited for the subsequent recursive calls.\n            visited.add(next_pos)\n            # Recurse with one less step.\n            total_walks += count_walks(next_pos, steps_left - 1, visited)\n            # Backtrack: Un-mark the position so it can be used by other paths.\n            visited.remove(next_pos)\n\n    return total_walks\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n\n    if n == 0:\n        result = 1\n        print(f\"a(0) = {result}\")\n        return\n\n    # Optimization: Exploit the symmetry of the grid.\n    # The number of walks starting with a move in any of the 4 directions is the same.\n    # We calculate the number of walks starting with a move to the right,\n    # and then multiply by 4.\n\n    # The walk starts at (0,0).
