# The problem asks for the value of the integral of (du/dt)^2 over all space.
# Our analysis shows that any solution profile u(x) that satisfies the
# given conditions at time t=tau must be a stationary solution of the PDE.
# A stationary solution has a time derivative (du/dt) equal to zero for all x.
# Therefore, the integrand (du/dt)^2 is zero everywhere.

# Let's define the terms for the final calculation.
# du_dt represents the value of the time derivative.
du_dt = 0

# The integral is over the square of this value.
integrand = du_dt**2

# The integral of 0 over any domain is 0.
final_integral_value = 0

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is essentially the calculation of the integral of 0.
