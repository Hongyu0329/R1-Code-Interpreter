The question asks for the mechanism by which magnesium can lower blood pressure. Let's analyze the options:

1.  **Choice A ({options['A']}):** Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. Calcium is required for smooth muscle contraction in the walls of blood vessels. By inhibiting the influx of calcium into these cells, magnesium promotes smooth muscle relaxation. This leads to the widening of blood vessels (vasodilation), which decreases peripheral resistance and, as a result, lowers blood pressure. This is the primary and most direct mechanism.

2.  **Choice B ({options['B']}):** While magnesium may have long-term benefits in preventing the calcification of arteries, this is not the direct mechanism for short-term blood pressure reduction.

3.  **Choice C ({options['C']}):** This relates to brain structure, which is not the direct target for blood pressure regulation via magnesium supplementation.

4.  **Choice D ({options['D']}):** This is incorrect. Magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties. An inflammatory response would be detrimental.

5.  **Choice E ({options['E']}):** This is incorrect. Magnesium and calcium are often antagonistic. Raising calcium levels would tend to increase, not decrease, blood pressure.

Therefore, the correct mechanism is direct vasodilation.
