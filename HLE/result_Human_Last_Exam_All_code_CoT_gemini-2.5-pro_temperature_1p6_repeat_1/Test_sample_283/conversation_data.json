    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is recursively partitioned into a block 2x2 structure. This process can be visualized as a binary tree. The question asks for the total number of submatrices that are defined and accessed within this structure for a tree of a specific depth.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate this number:\n1.  **Define the HSS tree structure:** An HSS tree of depth `d` (where the root is at level 0 and leaves are at level `d`) represents the recursive partitioning of the matrix.\n2.  **Identify the types of submatrices:**\n    *   **Off-diagonal blocks:** For each partitioning step (an *internal node* in the tree), the two off-diagonal blocks are approximated by low-rank matrices. These are stored as compressed submatrices (e.g., generator matrices).\n    *   **Diagonal blocks:** The two diagonal blocks are handled by the children of the current node. This continues until we reach the *leaf nodes* of the tree, which correspond to the smallest diagonal blocks and are stored as dense submatrices.\n3.  **Count the submatrices at each level:**\n    *   Calculate the number of internal nodes. These nodes exist from level 0 to level `d-1`. The number of nodes at any level `l` is `2^l`.\n    *   Calculate the number of off-diagonal blocks. Each internal node accounts for 2 off-diagonal blocks.\n    *   Calculate the number of leaf nodes. These nodes exist at level `d`, and there are `2^d` of them.\n    *   Calculate the number of diagonal leaf blocks. Each leaf node accounts for 1 dense diagonal block.\n4.  **Sum the counts:** The total number of submatrices is the sum of all off-diagonal blocks from the internal nodes and all diagonal blocks from the leaf nodes. During an HSS matrix operation like multiplication, the data representing each of these submatrices is accessed.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan for a depth of 4.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices in an HSS tree of a given depth.\n\n    In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) representation, a matrix is\n    recursively partitioned.
