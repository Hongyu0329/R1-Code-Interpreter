# The problem simplifies to calculating the limit of -e^(-12t)*(1+e^(-12t)) as t approaches infinity.
# Let's represent e^(-12t) in the limit.
# As t -> infinity, -12t -> -infinity, so e^(-12t) -> 0.
e_neg_inf = 0

# Now, we calculate the terms in the expression with this limit.
term1 = -e_neg_inf
term2 = 1 + e_neg_inf

# The final result is the product of these two terms.
result = term1 * term2

print("The final calculation involves taking a limit as t -> infinity.")
print(f"The expression is of the form -A * (1 + A), where A = e^(-12t).")
print(f"In the limit t -> infinity, A approaches {e_neg_inf}.")
print(f"So the expression becomes -{e_neg_inf} * (1 + {e_neg_inf}).")
print(f"The value is {-e_neg_inf} * {1 + e_neg_inf} = {result}.")
