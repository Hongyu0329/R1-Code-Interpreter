# (a) Is it true that A and B are similar if and only if the multiplicities of each eigenvalue are identical?
# For diagonal matrices, similarity is equivalent to having the same multiset of eigenvalues.
# A permutation of diagonal entries can be achieved by a similarity transformation with a permutation matrix (P A P^-1).
# Having the same multiset of eigenvalues is the same as having identical multiplicities for each eigenvalue.
ans_a = "Yes"

# (b) For n = 3 and 3 distinct eigenvalues, how many similarity classes exist?
# A similarity class is uniquely defined by the multiset of its eigenvalues.
# We need to find the number of multisets of size 3 that can be formed from a set of 3 distinct elements.
# This is a combinations with repetition problem.
# The formula is C(k + n - 1, n), where n is the size of the multiset (matrix size)
# and k is the number of distinct elements to choose from (number of distinct eigenvalues).
n = 3  # Matrix size
k = 3  # Number of distinct eigenvalue choices
result_b = math.comb(n + k - 1, n)

# The question asks for an expression in the answer for part (b).
# The expression will show the formula used and the final result.
expression_b = f"C({n} + {k} - 1, {n}) = {result_b}"

# (c) Does the number of similarity classes for diagonal matrices in M_n(F) grow exponentially with n for fixed q?
# The number of classes is C(n + q - 1, n), where q is the number of elements in the field F.
# For a fixed q, C(n + q - 1, n) is a polynomial in n of degree q-1.
# Polynomial growth is not exponential growth.
ans_c = "No"

# Print the final answer in the required format.
final_answer = f"(a) [{ans_a}]; (b) [{expression_b}]; (c) [{ans_c}]."
