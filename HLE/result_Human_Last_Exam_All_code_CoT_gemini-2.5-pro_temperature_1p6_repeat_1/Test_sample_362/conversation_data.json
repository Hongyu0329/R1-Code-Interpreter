    "My plan is to solve this organic chemistry problem by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: First, I will determine the chemical structures of the two reactants provided: pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane.\n    *   Pivalaldehyde is an aldehyde with a tert-butyl group: `(CH3)3C-CHO`.\n    *   The Wittig reagent is a phosphonium ylide. The key part is the carbon group attached to the phosphorus: `=CH-CH2-(2-Cl-C6H4)`.\n\n2.  **Apply Wittig Reaction Logic**: The fundamental mechanism of the Wittig reaction involves replacing the carbonyl oxygen atom (`=O`) of the aldehyde with the carbon group (`=CR'R''`) from the ylide to form a new C=C double bond.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure**: By combining the `(CH3)3C-CH=` fragment from the aldehyde and the `=CH-CH2-(2-Cl-C6H4)` fragment from the ylide, I will construct the final alkene product. The byproduct will be triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph3P=O`).\n\n4.  **Name the Product and Find its Formula**: I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the resulting alkene and calculate its molecular formula by counting the atoms.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that clearly presents the reaction. The script will print the names and structures of reactants and products, showing the overall transformation. To satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\", the script will explicitly print the molecular formulas, which contain the count of each atom.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the product of a specified Wittig reaction and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
