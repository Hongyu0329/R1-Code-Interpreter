    print("\nStep 1: Define the constituent parts of the space.")
    print("The space X' is composed of a collection of punctured line segments:")
    print(" - Let C_0 be the segment from (1, 0) to the origin, with the origin removed.")
    print(" - Let C_n (for n=1, 2, ...) be the segment from (1, 1/n) to the origin, with the origin removed.")
    print("The space X' is the union of all these parts: X' = C_0 U C_1 U C_2 U ...")
    print("Crucially, since the origin is removed, these sets C_n are all disjoint from each other.")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyze the connectivity of each part.")
    print("Each part C_n (for n >= 0) is a line segment missing one endpoint.")
    print("Such a space is homeomorphic to the interval (0, 1], which is connected.")
    print("So, X' is a disjoint union of an infinite number of connected sets.")

    print("\nStep 3: Determine if these parts are the final components.")
    print("A connected component is a maximal connected set. Let's analyze C_n for n >= 1.")
    print(" - Is C_n closed? Yes. The line segments only approached each other at the origin, which is removed. Any point outside C_n has a non-zero distance to C_n, so C_n contains all its limit points in X'.")
    print(" - Is C_n open? Yes. For any point x in C_n, we can find a small open ball around it that doesn't touch any other segment C_m (m != n). The minimum distance to other segments is positive because x is not the origin.")
    print("A set that is both open and closed (and non-empty and connected) is a connected component.")
    print("Therefore, each of C_1, C_2, C_3, ... is a connected component.")

    print("\nStep 4: Determine the component containing C_0.")
    print("We have established that C_1, C_2, ... are all individual components.")
    print("Connected components form a partition of the space. This means the component containing C_0 cannot contain any points from C_1, C_2, etc.")
    print("Since C_0 is itself connected, it cannot be broken down into smaller components.")
    print("Therefore, C_0 must be a connected component itself.")

    print("\nStep 5: Count the total number of components.")
    print("The connected components are:")
    print(" - One component: C_0")
    print(" - An infinite series of components: C_1, C_2, C_3, ...")
    print("The total number of components is 1 (for C_0) + 1 (for C_1) + 1 (for C_2) + ...")
