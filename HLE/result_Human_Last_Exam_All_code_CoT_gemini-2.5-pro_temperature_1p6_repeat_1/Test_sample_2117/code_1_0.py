# The problem asks for the least upper bound of the product E_P * E_H * S_P * S_H.
# The key is the term "Gaussian Hessenberg Decomposition", which we interpret as
# the direct reduction to Hessenberg form using Gaussian elimination transformations.
# This implies that the transformation matrix P is a unit lower triangular matrix.

# Step 1: Analyze the eigenvalues of P.
# A unit lower triangular matrix has only 1s on its diagonal.
# The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are its diagonal entries.
# Therefore, all eigenvalues of P are 1.
lambda_max_P = 1
lambda_min_P = 1

# Step 2: Calculate the average eigenvalue gap of P (E_P).
# E_P = (lambda_max(P) - lambda_min(P)) / (N - 1), where N = n + 2.
# For any positive integer n, N >= 3, so N - 1 is not zero.
numerator_EP = lambda_max_P - lambda_min_P
# E_P is therefore 0 for any n.
E_P = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the full product.
# The product is E_P * E_H * S_P * S_H.
# Since E_P = 0, the entire product is 0, assuming the other terms are finite.
# The terms E_H, S_P, and S_H are indeed finite for any n.
final_product = 0

# Step 4: Determine the least upper bound.
# Since the expression evaluates to 0 for all n, the set of values is {0}.
# The least upper bound of this set is 0.
least_upper_bound = final_product

# The final answer requires outputting each number in the final equation.
# We focus on the part of the equation that determines the result.
