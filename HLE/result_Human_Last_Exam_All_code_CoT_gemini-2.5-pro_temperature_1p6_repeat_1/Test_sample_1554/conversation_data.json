    "My plan is to first identify the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made the distinction between symptoms and signals. I will access my knowledge base on philosophy to find the correct individual. Then, I will create a simple Python script to print the name of this philosopher, as per the request to use a code block for the solution.\n\n```python\n# The question asks for the name of a philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw school.\n# This philosopher is known for decomposing the concept of a hallmark or sign\n# into 'symptoms' (natural signs) and 'signals' (conventional signs).\n# The philosopher credited with this distinction is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n# This script will print his name.\n\nphilosopher_name = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\nprint(philosopher_name)\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
