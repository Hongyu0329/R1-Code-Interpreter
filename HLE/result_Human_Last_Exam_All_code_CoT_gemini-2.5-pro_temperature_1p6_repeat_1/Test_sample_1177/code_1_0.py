    # the property (and therefore risk) does not pass until:

    print("- A is incorrect. Insurance is a remedy, not the determinant of who bears the legal risk.")
    print("- B is CORRECT. It accurately states that risk passed when Jake completed the repairs (put goods in a deliverable state) and notified Luke.")
    print("- C is incorrect. The text message was a clear and appropriate form of notice.")
    print("- D is incorrect. Risk follows property/ownership, not physical possession, under the Sale of Goods Act.")
    print("- E is incorrect. The goods were explicitly not in a deliverable state on June 2.")
