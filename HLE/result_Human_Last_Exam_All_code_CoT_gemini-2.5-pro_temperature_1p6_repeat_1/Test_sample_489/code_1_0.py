def solve_statements():
    """
    Solves the true/false statements and prints the result.

    The correctness of each statement is based on known mathematical results
    in the theory of quadratic forms and arithmetic groups.

    a) True: The quotient space is a Satake compactification, which is Hausdorff.
    b) True: Barycentric subdivision always produces a simplicial complex.
    c) False: The cone decomposition is not locally finite on the boundary.
    d) True: This is a known result from the classification of perfect forms for g=7.
    e) True: The stabilizer is the automorphism group of a lattice, which is finite.
    f) True: This is a known computational result for g=5.
    g) False: There is no general inclusion relation between stabilizers of a cone and its face.
