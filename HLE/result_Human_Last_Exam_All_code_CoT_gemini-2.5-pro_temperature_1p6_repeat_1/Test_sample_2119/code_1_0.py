# This script identifies the last name of the minister from the historical riddle.
# The riddle refers to "Alexei's tragedy", which is interpreted as the play "Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich"
# written by author Aleksey K. Tolstoy.
# The play was banned by censors, and the ban was famously upheld by the powerful, conservative minister
# described as "seeking to restore order where he saw none".
# This historical figure is Konstantin Pobedonostsev.
