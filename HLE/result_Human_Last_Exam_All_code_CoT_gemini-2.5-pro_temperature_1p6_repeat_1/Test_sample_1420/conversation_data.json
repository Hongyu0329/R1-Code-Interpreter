    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3, we will use the epsilon expansion method from renormalization group theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Parameters:** We are given a spatial dimension `d=3`. For the universality class of models like the Ising or Heisenberg models, the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. The epsilon expansion is performed in powers of the parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n2.  **Select the Model:** The scaling exponents depend on the number of components of the order parameter, denoted by `n`. Since the model is not specified, we will use the most common case for this type of problem: the Ising model, which corresponds to `n=1`.\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** The specific heat exponent `α` can be calculated to the first order in `ϵ` using the well-established formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Execute and Display:** We will write a Python script to define the parameters, calculate `ϵ`, substitute all values into the formula, and print the entire calculation step-by-step to show how the final result is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha (α) using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion in renormalization group theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
