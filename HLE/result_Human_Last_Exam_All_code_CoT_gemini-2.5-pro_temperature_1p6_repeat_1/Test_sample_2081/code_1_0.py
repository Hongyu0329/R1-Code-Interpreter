# The radius R is determined by the solvability condition of the boundary-value problem.
# The derived equation for R is R = sqrt(0.5 * (e^(2T) + e^T)).
# Given T = ln(10^34), we have e^T = 10^34 and e^(2T) = 10^68.
# So the final equation is R = sqrt(a * (b + c)), where a, b, and c are defined below.

# Define the numbers in the final equation.
# We use the Decimal type to handle the large numbers and maintain precision,
# as standard floats would cause a loss of significance in the b + c operation.
a = Decimal('0.5')
b = Decimal('10')**68
c = Decimal('10')**34

# Calculate R using high-precision arithmetic
R_squared = a * (b + c)
R = R_squared.sqrt()
