    "Of course, I can help you with this Galois theory problem. Here is my step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Field Extension:** I will start by examining the field $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$. I'll identify the key intermediate field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ and determine its properties.\n2.  **Determine the Degree:** The main task is to find the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$. This is given by $[L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. The degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is 4. I will determine $[L:K]$ by checking if the element $\\alpha = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in the field $K$. To do this, I will use a theorem from Galois theory involving norms.\n3.  **Identify the Galois Group:** Once the order of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is known to be 8, I will determine which of the five groups of order 8 it is ($C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$, or $Q_8$). I will do this by defining generators for the group and finding the relations they satisfy, particularly their orders and commutation rules.\n4.  **Verification with Code:** I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to perform and verify the crucial algebraic manipulations needed in the proof. This script will follow the theoretical steps and print the results of each calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code that carries out the plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the steps to determine the Galois group of\n    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the order of the Galois group.\")\n    print(\"Let L = Q(gamma, sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) where gamma = sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))).\")\n    print(\"Let K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
