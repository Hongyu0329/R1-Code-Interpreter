    "My plan is to provide a Python script that will answer the user's question about the pitch accent of 「弟」.\n\n1.  **Explain Pitch Accent:** First, I will briefly explain the main Japanese pitch accent patterns (Heiban, Atamadaka, Nakadaka, Odaka) to provide context.\n2.  **Create a Data Structure:** I will use a Python dictionary to act as a small database. This dictionary will map Japanese words to their pitch accent information, including the reading (kana), the pattern number, and the pattern name.\n3.  **Query and Print:** The script will look up the word 「弟」 in this dictionary.\n4.  **Output the Result:** Finally, it will print the pitch accent pattern number ([0]) and its corresponding name (Heiban), clearly stating the answer. The number `0` will satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    It uses a dictionary as a simple knowledge base.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping words to their pitch accent information.\n    # The format is: Kanji: (Reading, Pitch Accent Number, Pattern Name)\n    # Pitch Accent Numbers:\n    # 0: Heiban (flat)\n    # 1: Atamadaka (high on first mora, then drops)\n    # >1: Nakadaka (high on a middle mora) or Odaka (high until the last mora, then drops)\n    pitch_accent_db = {\n        \"弟\": (\"おとうと\", 0, \"Heiban\"),\n        \"頭\": (\"あたま\", 2, \"Nakadaka\"),\n        \"犬\": (\"いぬ\", 2, \"Odaka\"), # In this case it's Odaka because it's the last mora\n        \"箸\": (\"はし\", 1, \"Atamadaka\"),\n        \"橋\": (\"はし\", 2, \"Odaka\")\n    }\n\n    word_to_find = \"弟\"\n    \n    if word_to_find in pitch_accent_db:\n        reading, pattern_number, pattern_name = pitch_accent_db[word_to_find]\n        \n        print(f\"The Japanese word is 「{word_to_find}」, which is read as 「{reading}」.\")\n        print(\"The standard pitch accent pattern can be represented by a number.\")\n        print(f\"The equation for this word's pitch accent is:\")\n        print(f\"「{word_to_find}」 = [{pattern_number}]\")\n        print(f\"\\nA pitch accent of [{pattern_number}] corresponds to the '{pattern_name}' pattern.\")\n        print(\"For a Heiban word like 「弟」 (おとうと), the pitch is low on the first mora (お) and then rises and stays high for the rest of the word (とうと).\")\n\n    else:\n        print(f\"Pitch accent information for '{word_to_find}' not found.\")\n\nfind_pitch_accent()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
