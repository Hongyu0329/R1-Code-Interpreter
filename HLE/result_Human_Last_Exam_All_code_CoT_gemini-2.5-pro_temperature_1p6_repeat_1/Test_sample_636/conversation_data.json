    "To find the state feedback gain matrix `F`, we will use the pole placement method. The goal is to design `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system, represented by the matrix `A + BF`, are located at the desired positions `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** From the desired eigenvalues `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`, we can construct the target characteristic polynomial:\n    `(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j)) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the System's Characteristic Polynomial:** We define `F` as a matrix of unknowns `[[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`. Then we compute the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` and find its characteristic polynomial, `det(A_cl - λI) = 0`. The coefficients of this polynomial will be in terms of `f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄`.\n\n3.  **Solve for F:** By equating the coefficients of the system's polynomial with those of the desired polynomial, we obtain a system of linear equations. Since the system has more unknowns (4) than equations (2), there are infinite solutions. We will find one of the simplest solutions by making a simplifying assumption (e.g., setting `f₃` and `f₄` to zero).\n\n4.  **Implement and Verify:** The following Python script implements this plan. It solves for the elements of `F` and then verifies the result by calculating the eigenvalues of the resulting `A + BF` matrix to ensure they match the desired poles.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_feedback_gain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given linear system A, B\n    such that the closed-loop system A + BF has specified eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # System matrices\n    A = np.array([[-1, 1], \n                  [1, 0]])\n    B = np.array([[1, 2], \n                  [1, 0]])\n\n    # Desired eigenvalues (poles)\n    desired_poles = np.array([-1 + 1j, -1 - 1j])\n\n    # The desired characteristic polynomial is (lambda - p1)(lambda - p2)\n    # For p1, p2 = -1 +/- j, this is lambda^2 + 2*lambda + 2 = 0\n    #\n    # The characteristic polynomial of A_cl = A + BF is det(lambda*I - A_cl) = 0\n    # Let F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]].\n    # A_cl = A + BF = [[-1+f1+2*f3, 1+f2+2*f4], [1+f1, f2]]\n    # The polynomial is lambda^2 - trace(A_cl)*lambda + det(A_cl) = 0.\n    #\n    # Equating coefficients with the desired polynomial gives:\n    # 1) -trace(A_cl) = 2  => -(-1+f1+2*f3 + f2) = 2  => f1+f2+2*f3 = -1\n    # 2) det(A_cl) = 2     => f2*(-1+f1+2*f3) - (1+f1)*(1+f2+2*f4) = 2 => -f1-2*f2+2*f2*f3-2*f4-2*f1*f4 = 3\n    #\n    # This system is underdetermined.
