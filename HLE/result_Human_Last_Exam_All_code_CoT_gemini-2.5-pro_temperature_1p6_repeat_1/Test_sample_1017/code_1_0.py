# Define the translation numbers from the problem description.

# Based on the analysis, the stable commutator length (scl) of the commutator [g1, h2]
# in the free product G1 * G2 is given by the formula:
# scl = 1/2 * min(|translation(g)|, |translation(h)|)
# Here, we assume the problem intends to ask for the scl of the commutator [g1, h2],
# as the scl for the element g1h2 itself is not well-defined.
