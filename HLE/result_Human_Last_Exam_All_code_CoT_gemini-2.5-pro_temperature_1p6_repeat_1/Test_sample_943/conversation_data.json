    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Tensor and the Slice Rank\nFirst, I need to understand the object we're dealing with. The problem defines a function from $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$:\n$T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$.\nThis function is viewed as a 3-tensor in the space $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n}$, where $V$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This is a tensor of size $2^n \\times 2^n \\times 2^n$.\n\nThe problem gives the slice rank of this tensor, let's call it $SR(T_n)$, as an asymptotic formula:\n$SR(T_n) = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\nThe term $e^{o(n)}$ represents sub-exponential factors, which means that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (SR(T_n))^{1/n} = 3/2^K$. This limit is known as the asymptotic slice rank.\n\nMy goal is to find the value of $K$. To do this, I need to calculate the asymptotic slice rank of $T_n$ and equate it to $3/2^K$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Tensor\nThe tensor $T_n$ is defined as $A_n - \\mathbf{1}$, where $A_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ and $\\mathbf{1}$ is the tensor of all ones. The all-ones tensor has a slice rank of 1.\nThe slice rank is sub-additive, meaning $SR(A+B) \\le SR(A) + SR(B)$.\nSo, $SR(T_n) = SR(A_n - \\mathbf{1}) \\le SR(A_n) + SR(\\mathbf{1}) = SR(A_n) + 1$.\nAnd, $SR(A_n) = SR(T_n + \\mathbf{1}) \\le SR(T_n) + SR(\\mathbf{1}) = SR(T_n) + 1$.\nThis implies $|SR(T_n) - SR(A_n)| \\le 1$. Since the slice rank grows exponentially with $n$, this difference of 1 is negligible for the asymptotic slice rank.\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (SR(T_n))^{1/n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (SR(A_n))^{1/n}$.\nSo, I can focus on finding the asymptotic slice rank of $A_n$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of $A_n$\nThe tensor $A_n$ is constructed by a product over coordinates. This means it has a tensor product structure.\n$A_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^n A_1(x_i, y_i, z_i)$, where $A_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1+y_1+z_1$.\nHere, $A_1$ is a base tensor of size $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$. $A_n$ is the $n$-th tensor power of $A_1$: $A_n = A_1^{\\otimes n}$.\n\nThe asymptotic slice rank is multiplicative with respect to the tensor product, so:\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (SR(A_1^{\\otimes n}))^{1/n} = \\underline{SR}(A_1)$, where $\\underline{SR}(A_1)$ is the asymptotic slice rank of the base tensor $A_1$.\n\nHowever, calculating the asymptotic slice rank directly is often difficult. An alternative is to find the exact slice rank $SR(A_1^{\\otimes n})$ for general $n$. If $SR(A_1^{\\otimes n}) = c^n$ for some constant $c$, then the asymptotic slice rank is $c$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Slice Rank of $A_1^{\\otimes n}$\nLet's find the slice rank of $A_n = A_1^{\\otimes n}$.\nThe slice rank of a tensor is bounded above by the rank of any of its \"unfoldings\". For example, we can view the tensor as a collection of matrices (slices). The dimension of the space spanned by these matrices is an upper bound on the slice rank.\n\nLet's consider the slices along the $z$-axis. A slice is a $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix $M_z(x,y) = A_n(x,y,z)$ for a fixed $z \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$.\nDue to the product structure, $M_z = \\bigotimes_{i=1}^n M_{z_i}$, where $M_{z_i}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ matrix for the base tensor $A_1(x_1,y_1,z_i)$.\nFor $z_i=0$, the slice is $M_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0+0 & 0+1 \\\\ 1+0 & 1+1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $z_i=1$, the slice is $M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0+0+1 & 0+1+1 \\\\ 1+0+1 & 1+1+1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe rank of $M_0$ is 2 (since $\\det(M_0)=-1 \\ne 0$). The dimension of the space of frontal slices for $A_n$, let's call it $R_z(A_n)$, is the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{ \\bigotimes_{i=1}^n M_{z_i} \\}_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}^n}$.\nThe set of matrices $\\{M_z\\}$ spans a vector space of dimension $2^n$. Since all these spanning matrices are non-zero, this shows $R_z(A_n) = 2^n$. This gives an upper bound: $SR(A_n) \\le R_z(A_n) = 2^n$.\n\nNow for a lower bound. The slice rank of a tensor is at least the maximum rank of any of its slices.\nLet's consider the slice for $z=(0,0,\\dots,0)$. This is the matrix $M_{(0,\\dots,0)} = M_0 \\otimes M_0 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes M_0 = M_0^{\\otimes n}$.\nThe rank of a tensor product of matrices is the product of their ranks.\nrank$(M_0^{\\otimes n}) = (\\text{rank}(M_0))^n = 2^n$.\nSo, we have a lower bound: $SR(A_n) \\ge \\text{rank}(M_0^{\\otimes n}) = 2^n$.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we get an exact value for the slice rank:\n$SR(A_n) = 2^n$.\n\n### Step 5: Solve for K\nNow I can compute the asymptotic slice rank:\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (SR(A_n))^{1/n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (2^n)^{1/n} = 2$.\nThe problem states this limit is $3/2^K$.\nSo, I have the equation:\n$3/2^K = 2$\n$3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K$\n$3/2 = 2^K$\nTaking the logarithm base 2 on both sides:\n$K = \\log_2(3/2) = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3) - 1$.\n\nI will use Python to compute this value and print the result as requested. The code will also show the final equation being solved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find K in the expression for the slice rank of a tensor.\n# The slice rank is given as (3 / 2**K)**n * exp(o(n)).\n# This means the asymptotic slice rank is gamma = 3 / 2**K.\n\n# We determined that the asymptotic slice rank of the tensor is 2.\n# So, we need to solve the equation: gamma = 2.\ngamma = 2\nval_3 = 3\nval_2 = 2\n\n# The equation is 3 / (2**K) = 2\n# 3 = 2 * (2**K)\n# 3 / 2 = 2**K\n# K = log2(3/2)\nK = math.log2(val_3 / val_2)\n\nprint(\"The final equation to solve for K is:\")\nprint(f\"{val_3} / ({val_2}**K) = {val_2}\")\nprint(f\"Solving for K gives K = log2(3/2) = log2(3) - 1\")\nprint(f\"The value of K is: {K}\")\n```"
