    # Step 1: Based on Sharkovsky's theorem and the problem statement, we deduce the
    # set of non-existent periods 'T'.
    # Given: period 13 exists, but period 11 does not.
    # The Sharkovsky ordering includes: 3 > 5 > 7 > 9 > 11 > 13 > ...
    # No period 11 implies no period 'k' for any 'k' that precedes 11 (k > 11).
    # Thus, the function has no periods from the set {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}.
    # Existence of period 13 implies existence of all periods 'l' that 13 precedes (13 > l).

    # divisors 'p' of k (where p > 1), there is no point of period p.
    # This is equivalent to checking if all divisors of k (p > 1) are in the set T.
    #
    # To find S, we can test which numbers 'k' have all their divisors (p > 1) within T.
    # A crucial deduction is that if k is in S (and k > 1), then k itself must be in T.
    # This significantly limits our search space to just the numbers in T and k=1.
