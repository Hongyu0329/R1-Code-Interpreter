    Calculates the query complexity for sorting N L-bit strings in two regimes.

    The complexity is expressed as a tuple (a, b, c) representing the class
    Theta(sqrt(N^a * (log N)^b * (log log N)^c)).

    Method:
    1. The problem is equivalent to integer sorting. Advanced integer sorting algorithms,
       like fusion trees, achieve a complexity of O(N log N / log L) in the
       transdichotomous model, which can be simulated with the given C and H queries.

    2. For each regime, we express L in terms of N and substitute it into the
       complexity formula.

    3. We then convert the resulting complexity into the (a, b, c) notation by
       equating Theta(sqrt(N^a * (log N)^b * (log log N)^c)) with the derived
       complexity expression and solving for a, b, and c.

    Regime 1: N = 2^sqrt(L)
      - L = (log N)^2
      - Complexity = O(N log N / log(L))
                   = O(N log N / log((log N)^2))
                   = O(N log N / loglog N)
      - Squaring this gives N^2 * (log N)^2 * (loglog N)^-2
      - This corresponds to (a=2, b=2, c=-2).

    Regime 2: N = 2^((log L)^2)
      - L = 2^sqrt(log N)
      - Complexity = O(N log N / log(L))
                   = O(N log N / log(2^sqrt(log N)))
                   = O(N log N / sqrt(log N))
                   = O(N * sqrt(log N))
      - Squaring this gives N^2 * log N
      - This corresponds to (a=2, b=1, c=0).
