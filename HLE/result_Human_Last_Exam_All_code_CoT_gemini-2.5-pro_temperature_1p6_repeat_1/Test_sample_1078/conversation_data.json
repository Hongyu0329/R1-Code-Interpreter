    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to identify all the distinct irreducible root systems of rank 4. The finite Weyl groups are classified by the Dynkin diagrams, and the rank of the group corresponds to the number of vertices in its diagram.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  List the families of Dynkin diagrams that classify finite Weyl groups: A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, and G_2.\n2.  For each family, check if it can have a rank of 4.\n    *   **A_n**: Setting n=4 gives the diagram A_4, which has rank 4.\n    *   **B_n / C_n**: Setting n=4 gives B_4 and C_4. Both have rank 4. The Weyl groups W(B_n) and W(C_n) are isomorphic for n â‰¥ 2, so they count as a single non-isomorphic group.\n    *   **D_n**: Setting n=4 gives D_4, which has rank 4.\n    *   **F_4**: This is a specific exceptional diagram with 4 vertices, so it has rank 4.\n    *   **E_n / G_2**: The ranks of these are fixed (E_6, E_7, E_8, G_2), and none of them are 4.\n3.  The distinct, non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are therefore those corresponding to the diagrams A_4, B_4, D_4, and F_4.\n4.  Summing these up gives the total count.\n\nThe following Python code enumerates these groups and calculates the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n    Finite Weyl groups are classified by irreducible root systems, which correspond to\n    the connected Dynkin diagrams: A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2.\n    The rank of the group is the number of nodes in its diagram. We need to find\n    all such diagrams with exactly 4 nodes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary to hold the count for each type.\n    # We count 1 for each type that has a rank-4 representative.\n    # Note: B_n and C_n have isomorphic Weyl groups, so they are considered as one type.\n    contributions = {\n        \"A_4\": 1,        # The group from the A_n series with n=4\n        \"B_4 / C_4\": 1,  # The group from B_n/C_n series with n=4 (W(B_4) is isomorphic to W(C_4))\n        \"D_4\": 1,        # The group from the D_n series with n=4\n        \"F_4\": 1,        # The exceptional group F_4 is of rank 4 by definition\n    }\n\n    print(\"The non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are derived from the following Dynkin diagrams:\")\n    for group_type, count in contributions.items():\n        print(f\"- Type {group_type}: {count} group\")\n\n    # Calculate the total by summing the contributions\n    total_count = sum(contributions.values())\n    \n    # Get the individual numbers for the final equation\n    numbers = list(contributions.values())\n    \n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number, we sum the counts from each type:\")\n    # Creates a string like \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\"\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, numbers)) + f\" = {total_count}\"\n    \n    print(equation_str)\n\n\n# Execute the function to print the result\ncount_weyl_groups_rank_4()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
