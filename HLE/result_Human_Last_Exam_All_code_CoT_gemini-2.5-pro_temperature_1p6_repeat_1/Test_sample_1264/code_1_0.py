    1. Transpose the song from its original key (Ab major) to the key context of A minor.
       This is interpreted as the key of C major, the relative major of A minor.
    2. Identify the chords at the specified lyrical transition.
    3. Analyze the melodic note played over these chords to find the enharmonic change.
