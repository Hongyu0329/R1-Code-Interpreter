    "There are 17 wallpaper groups in total. Each wallpaper group is associated with a point group, which describes the symmetries of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed (like rotations and reflections). The 'order' of a point group is the number of distinct symmetry operations it contains.\n\nWe are looking for wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. There are two types of point groups with order 2:\n1.  **C2**: Contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n2.  **D1**: Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nI will write a Python script to:\n1.  Store the data of all 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their corresponding point groups.\n2.  Iterate through this data to find the groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n3.  Count how many such groups exist for each point group type (C2 and D1).\n4.  Print the names of the identified groups and the final calculation, showing how the total number is derived.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the wallpaper groups with a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 17 wallpaper groups.
