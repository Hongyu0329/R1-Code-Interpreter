    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to deduce the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Quote:** I will break down the clues from the quote by Andrei Voznesensky.\n    *   \"a joy-discovering sailor\": This points to an explorer or voyager, likely Russian given the poet's nationality.\n    *   \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\": This indicates the person's burial site was lost or unknown for a significant period.\n    *   \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\": This provides a specific timeframe for the rediscovery or memorialization of the grave.\n\n2.  **Connect to Voznesensky:** I will consider Andrei Voznesensky's major works. He is famous for writing the libretto for the Russian rock opera *Juno and Avos*.\n\n3.  **Identify the Subject:** The opera *Juno and Avos* is about the real-life journey of the Russian explorer and statesman Nikolai Rezanov. Rezanov's story matches all the clues:\n    *   He was a voyager who sailed to Russian America and then to Spanish California.\n    *   He died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his return journey. His original grave was destroyed by the Soviets, and its location was lost.\n    *   In the late 1980s, following the immense popularity of the opera, a memorial was erected in Krasnoyarsk to honor him, effectively \"answering\" the question of his final resting place.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Formulation:** Based on this deduction, the man's last name is Rezanov. I will write a simple Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The individual referenced is Nikolai Rezanov (1764-1807), a central figure in the Russian-American Company.\n# The poet Andrei Voznesensky immortalized him in the popular rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n# Rezanov's story fits all the clues:\n# 1. He was an explorer and diplomat, matching the \"sailor\" description.\n# 2. He died in Krasnoyarsk, and his gravesite was lost after the Voskresensky Cathedral was destroyed.\n# 3. In the late 1980s, during Perestroika, a monument (a white cross) was placed at his presumed burial site.\n\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\nprint(f\"The last name of the man is: {last_name}\")\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
