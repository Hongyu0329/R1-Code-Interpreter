# The individual referenced is Nikolai Rezanov (1764-1807), a central figure in the Russian-American Company.
# The poet Andrei Voznesensky immortalized him in the popular rock opera "Juno and Avos".
# Rezanov's story fits all the clues:
# 1. He was an explorer and diplomat, matching the "sailor" description.
# 2. He died in Krasnoyarsk, and his gravesite was lost after the Voskresensky Cathedral was destroyed.
# 3. In the late 1980s, during Perestroika, a monument (a white cross) was placed at his presumed burial site.
