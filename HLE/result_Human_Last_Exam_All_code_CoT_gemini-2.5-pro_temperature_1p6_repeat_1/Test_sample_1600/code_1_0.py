    This function calculates a(3) based on a specific interpretation of the problem statement.

    The problem asks for a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n
    in QED, and specifically for a(3). Order 2n corresponds to n loops.

    The number of diagrams is different for the electron propagator (72 at 3 loops) and
    the photon propagator (2 at 3 loops). This ambiguity is resolved by interpreting a(n)
    as the number of diagrams contributing to the n-loop calculation of the QED beta-function,
    a fundamental property of the theory.

    The known values for this interpretation are:
    a(1) = 1 (for 1-loop)
    a(2) = 2 (for 2-loop)
    a(3) = 10 (for 3-loop)
