    "To solve this problem, we first need to correctly interpret the definition of `a(n)`.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the definition of a(n):** The term `a(n)` is defined as the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). In QED, the order of a perturbative calculation is typically given by the power of the coupling constant `e`. Loop diagrams contribute in powers of `e^2`, so a diagram of order `2n` corresponds to an `n`-loop diagram. The question asks for `a(3)`, which means we need to find the number of 3-loop diagrams.\n\n2.  **Address the ambiguity:** The phrase \"for the electron or the photon propagators\" is ambiguous because the number of diagrams is different for each.\n    *   For the **electron propagator**, the number of 1-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams for n=1, 2, 3 loops is 1, 7, and **72**, respectively.\n    *   For the **photon propagator**, the number of 1PI diagrams for n=1, 2, 3 loops is 1, 1, and **2**, respectively.\n\n3.  **Find a consistent interpretation:** This ambiguity suggests we should look for a quantity that is a fundamental property of the QED theory itself, is derived from the propagators, and depends on the loop order `n`. The number of diagrams contributing to the QED beta-function is a perfect candidate. The beta-function describes how the coupling constant of the theory runs with energy, and its calculation at `n` loops involves analyzing diagrams of order `2n` related to propagator and vertex renormalization.\n\n4.  **Determine the value:** The number of diagrams contributing to the `n`-loop calculation of the QED beta-function is a known sequence.\n    *   For `n=1` (1-loop), `a(1) = 1` diagram.\n    *   For `n=2` (2-loop), `a(2) = 2` diagrams.\n    *   For `n=3` (3-loop), `a(3) = 10` diagrams.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on this interpretation, `a(3)` is 10. We will write a Python script to display this result clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagram_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates a(3) based on a specific interpretation of the problem statement.\n\n    The problem asks for a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n\n    in QED, and specifically for a(3). Order 2n corresponds to n loops.\n\n    The number of diagrams is different for the electron propagator (72 at 3 loops) and\n    the photon propagator (2 at 3 loops). This ambiguity is resolved by interpreting a(n)\n    as the number of diagrams contributing to the n-loop calculation of the QED beta-function,\n    a fundamental property of the theory.\n\n    The known values for this interpretation are:\n    a(1) = 1 (for 1-loop)\n    a(2) = 2 (for 2-loop)\n    a(3) = 10 (for 3-loop)\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n\n    # The number of diagrams for the 3-loop QED beta-function calculation.\n    a_3 = 10\n\n    # The problem requests to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The equation is a(n) = result.\n    print(f\"n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"a(n) is the number of diagrams for the n-loop QED beta-function calculation.\")\n    print(f\"The value for a({n}) is {a_3}.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: a({n}) = {a_3}\")\n\nsolve_feynman_diagram_count()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
