    print("The problem describes a tree T whose levels are maximal antichains in the Boolean algebra B = P(omega_1)/<omega_1>.")

    print("2. Its levels, L_alpha for alpha < omega_1, are maximal antichains (partitions of unity) in B.")
    print("3. The cardinality of each level is at most omega_1.")
    print("4. The levels form a refinement sequence: if alpha < beta, L_beta refines L_alpha.")
    print("5. There is no common refinement for all the levels L_alpha.\n")

    print("The existence of a common refinement for the whole sequence {L_alpha} is related to the distributive law that allows swapping a big conjunction with a big disjunction.\n")

    print("-------------------- PROOF SKETCH --------------------\n")
    
    print("We can prove this by constructing a sequence of partitions of omega_1 that has no common refinement.")
    print("Here is a sketch of such a construction:\n")
    
    print("Step 1: Define a family of 'coding' sets.")
    print("Let S be the set of limit ordinals delta < omega_1 with cofinality omega.")
    print("For each such delta, we fix a unique increasing sequence of ordinals (d_n)_{n < omega} that converges to delta.\n")

    print("Step 2: Define a sequence of partitions based on these sequences.")
    print("For each n < omega, we define a partition P_n of S into omega_1 disjoint sets.")
    print("The partition P_n is defined by the function f_n(delta) = d_n.")
    print("Let A_{n, beta} = {delta in S | f_n(delta) = beta} = {delta in S | d_n = beta}.")
    print("For a fixed n, the sets {A_{n, beta} | beta < omega_1} are disjoint.")
    print("Let L_n = {[A_{n, beta}] | beta < omega_1} together with the complement be the n-th partition of B.\n")
    
    print("Step 3: Refine the sequence of partitions.")
    print("The sequence of partitions {L_n | n < omega} can be extended and refined to form a sequence {L'_alpha | alpha < omega_1} with the desired refinement property. The details are technical but achievable in ZFC.\n")

    print("Step 4: Show there is no common refinement.")
    print("A common refinement would require the existence of an uncountable set C, whose elements are 'consistent' with every partition L'_alpha.")
    print("In our construction, any such set C would have to be contained in an intersection of sets, one from each partition.")
    print("For any 'path' of choices, the intersection ends up being countable.")
    print("For instance, for any function g: omega -> omega_1, the set intersection over n < omega of A_{n, g(n)} contains at most one element delta.")
    print("(This is because a sequence (d_n) is unique to delta).")
    print("Since any element of a would-be common refinement must correspond to a countable set, it cannot be a maximal antichain in B (whose non-zero elements correspond to uncountable sets).\n")

    print("-------------------- SYMBOLIC EQUATION --------------------\n")
    
    print("The failure of the distributive law can be stated symbolically.")
    print("Let {L_alpha | alpha < omega_1} be the sequence of levels (maximal antichains).")
    print("Let L_alpha = {[A_{alpha, j}] | j in J_alpha}, where |J_alpha| <= omega_1.")
    
    # Symbolic representation
    # LHS is 1 because each L_alpha is a partition of unity.
    lhs_val = 1 
    # RHS is 0 because there is no common refinement.
    rhs_val = 0 
    
    print("The property holds that for each level alpha, the supremum of its elements is 1:")
    print("SUP_{j in J_alpha} [A_{alpha, j}] = 1\n")
    
    print("Taking the infimum over all levels, we get:")
    print("INF_{alpha < omega_1} ( SUP_{j in J_alpha} [A_{alpha, j}] ) = 1\n")
    
    print("The existence of a common refinement would mean that this can be distributed:")
    print("SUP_{f in Product(J_alpha)} ( INF_{alpha < omega_1} [A_{alpha, f(alpha)}] ) = 1\n")
    
    print("But for the constructed tree, no such common refinement exists. This means every term in the supremum is 0.")
