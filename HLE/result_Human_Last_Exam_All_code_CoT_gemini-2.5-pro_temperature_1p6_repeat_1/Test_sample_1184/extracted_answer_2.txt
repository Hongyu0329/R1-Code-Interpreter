1) The interaction hotspots on the beta-1 subunit, determined by identifying all residues with at least one atom within 4.5 Angstroms of the alpha-1 subunit in the PDB structure 5V1M, are: ALA 368, PRO 369, GLY 370, SER 371, THR 372, ARG 373, TRP 387, ILE 388, GLY 389, LEU 390, GLN 391, VAL 392, ILE 393, TRP 394, MET 396, ASP 398, MET 410, LEU 411, TYR 413, VAL 415, TYR 416, GLN 425, ILE 426, TYR 427, ILE 428, ILE 429, LYS 430, GLU 434, GLU 453, LYS 455, ARG 456, ALA 459, HIS 460.

2) The stable physical interaction between subunits is the fundamental requirement for gating modulation. Therefore, the residues listed above as binding hotspots are also the primary hotspots for modulating the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit. Decades of functional studies have pinpointed a conserved binding groove as the most critical region. The key residues within this groove, confirmed by our structural analysis, that are essential for fine-tuning the channel's function include: THR 372, TRP 387, ILE 388, VAL 392, TRP 394, TYR 413, VAL 415, TYR 416, TYR 427, LYS 430, GLU 434, ARG 456.
