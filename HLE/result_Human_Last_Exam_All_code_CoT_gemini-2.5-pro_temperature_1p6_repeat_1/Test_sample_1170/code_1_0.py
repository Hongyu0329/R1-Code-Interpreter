    Solves the problem based on the theoretical understanding of tensor-triangulated geometry.

    The problem asks to identify which of 20 given objects in a specific tensor-triangulated
    category generate a prime tt-ideal, and how many prime tt-ideals are not generated by
    any of these objects.

    The solution is derived from the classification of prime tt-ideals for the category
    D_b(E(C_p)) as established in the literature (by Stevenson, Williamson, etc.).

    Step 1: Identify the prime generators from the list.
    - The prime tt-ideals are of the form P_c and Q_c for c in P^1_k.
    - Object 2, kC_p(0), generates Q_inf.
    - Object 4, rad(kC_p), generates P_inf.
    - Object 7, cone(tau) for nonzero tau, generates P_c for some c in k^*.
    - Object 11, kC_p(0) tensor cone(tau), generates Q_c for that same c.
    - Object 15, S, is the generator for the stable category and generates Q_inf in K.
    - Object 16, S tensor kC_p(0), also generates Q_inf.
    - Other objects either generate non-prime ideals (e.g., primary ideals like cone(tau)^n, or ideals with non-irreducible support like rad(kC_p) tensor cone(tau)), are the unit object (k(0)), or are zero (S tensor with an object supported on the trivial subgroup).
    - The list of numbers corresponding to objects that generate a prime ideal is [2, 4, 7, 11, 15, 16].

    Step 2: Count the number of ungenerated primes.
    - The total number of primes is 2 * (|k| + 1).
    - The given list provides generators for: P_inf, Q_inf, one P_c (c != 0), one Q_c (c != 0).
    - This leaves P_0, Q_0, and all other P_c's and Q_c's for c in k^* ungenerated.
    - The question asks for a single number, which suggests assuming the simplest case for k.
    - Let k = F_2. Then p=2, and k^* = {1}. The "one c in k^*" covers all such c.
    - For k=F_2, the primes are {P_0, P_1, P_inf, Q_0, Q_1, Q_inf}. Total 6 primes.
    - The list generates P_1, P_inf, Q_1, Q_inf.
    - The ungenerated primes are P_0 and Q_0. There are 2 of them.
