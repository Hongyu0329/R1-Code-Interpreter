    # The problem defines a tower <x_alpha> with certain properties.
    # By analyzing the complements y_alpha = omega_2 \ x_alpha, we can show that
    # the problem is equivalent to finding the value of the tower number for omega_2, denoted t(omega_2).
    #
    # The tower number t(kappa) is the smallest length of a sequence of subsets of kappa
    # that is "almost increasing" and has no "almost upper bound".
    #
    # Key facts from ZFC set theory about the tower number t(kappa) for a regular cardinal kappa:
    # 1. t(kappa) must be greater than or equal to kappa. For kappa = omega_2, t(omega_2) >= omega_2.
    # 2. t(kappa) must be a regular cardinal.
    #
    # We are looking for the second smallest possible value of delta = t(omega_2).
    
    # Smallest possible value:
    # It's a known consistency result that t(omega_2) = omega_2 is possible in ZFC.
    # Since t(omega_2) must be >= omega_2, this is the smallest possible value.

    # Second smallest possible value:
    # Since t(omega_2) must be a regular cardinal, any possible value must be in the
    # sequence of regular cardinals starting from omega_2.
    # The cardinal number immediately following omega_2 is omega_3.
    # Since omega_3 is a successor cardinal, it is regular.
    # There are no cardinals between omega_2 and omega_3.
    # Thus, if t(omega_2) is not omega_2, the next possible value would be at least omega_3.
    # It is also a known consistency result that t(omega_2) = omega_3 is possible in ZFC.
    # Therefore, the second smallest possible value for delta is omega_3.
