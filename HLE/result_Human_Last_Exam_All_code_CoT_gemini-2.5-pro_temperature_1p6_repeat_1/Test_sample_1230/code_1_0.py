# Diet Stressor Score: The diet is extremely restrictive (limits protein, fat, and carbs),
# which is a primary cause of fatigue and struggle.

# Exercise Stressor Score: Starting a new exercise routine is demanding,
# but it's secondary to the immediate energy drain from the diet.

# Mindset Support Score: Psychotherapy has been successful, giving him a strong mental foundation.
# This is a positive, supporting factor.
mindset_support_score = 7

# --- Step 2: Explain the adjustment priority logic ---
# The area with the highest stressor score is the one that needs to be addressed first.
# Mindset is a supporting factor, not a primary stressor in this case.
