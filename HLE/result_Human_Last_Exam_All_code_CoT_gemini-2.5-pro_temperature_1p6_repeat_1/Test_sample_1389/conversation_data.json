    "An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is one that provides complete protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population (let's call this percentage `VE_true`), while providing no protection to the rest. The parameter `VE_true` is what we consider the vaccine's true efficacy. We want to see if the standard formula for calculating efficacy from observational data, `1 - IRR`, accurately reflects this true efficacy.\n\nTo figure this out, let's establish a model:\n1.  **Define Rates:** Let `λ` (lambda) be the incidence rate of the disease in the unvaccinated population. So, `IR_unvaccinated = λ`.\n2.  **Model Vaccinated Population:** In the vaccinated group, a proportion equal to `VE_true` is completely immune (their infection rate is 0). The remaining proportion, `1 - VE_true`, is not immune and has the same infection rate as the unvaccinated population (`λ`).\n3.  **Calculate Vaccinated Incidence Rate:** The overall incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group is the average rate across both the immune and non-immune subgroups. This is calculated as:\n    `IR_vaccinated = (VE_true * 0) + ((1 - VE_true) * λ) = (1 - VE_true) * λ`\n4.  **Calculate IRR and Final Efficacy:** Now we can calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) and the measured vaccine efficacy (`VE_measured`).\n    *   `IRR = IR_vaccinated / IR_unvaccinated = ((1 - VE_true) * λ) / λ = 1 - VE_true`\n    *   `VE_measured = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - VE_true) = VE_true`\n\nAs you can see from the derivation, the measured efficacy (`VE_measured`) is exactly equal to the true efficacy (`VE_true`). Therefore, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, `1 - IRR` **correctly estimates** the vaccine efficacy.\n\nThe following Python script simulates this scenario with example numbers to make the concept clearer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes if 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) correctly estimates the\n    efficacy of an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
