# The problem is to find the smallest integer dimension n
# for which a certain Fourier restriction inequality fails.

# The failure of the inequality is linked to the possibility of
# constructing a "bilinear" counterexample.
# This construction is possible if and only if the parameter space
# of the paraboloid, which is R^(n-1), has a dimension of at least 2.
# This allows for the existence of two non-zero orthogonal vectors,
# which is the geometric condition required for the counterexample.

# The mathematical condition is therefore: n - 1 >= 2
# We are looking for the smallest integer n (where n>=2 since P^{n-1} is defined)
# that satisfies this condition.

# We can find this by starting our search from n=2.
n = 2
while True:
  # Check if the dimension of the parameter space is at least 2
  if (n - 1) >= 2:
    smallest_n = n
    break
  n += 1

print("The smallest dimension n for which the inequality fails is the smallest integer n >= 2 satisfying the condition n - 1 >= 2.")
print(f"This is because for n >= 3, the parameter space R^(n-1) has dimension at least 2, allowing for bilinear counterexamples.")
print(f"For n = 2, the condition is not met, and the inequality is known to hold.")
print(f"The final answer is n = {smallest_n}")
