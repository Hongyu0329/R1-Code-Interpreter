    "To answer your question, I will identify the specific genus of bacterium known for this property. The bacterium in question is more famous for its bioluminescence (light produced by a chemical reaction), but it is the one cited for producing compounds that exhibit triboluminescence (light produced from mechanical stress or friction).\n\nI will use a Python script to store and print the name of this genus.\n\n```python\ndef find_bacterium_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the genus of a bacterium known for\n    producing a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus is Photorhabdus. While famously bioluminescent, it is the\n    # genus associated with producing compounds exhibiting triboluminescence.\n    bacterium_genus = \"Photorhabdus\"\n    \n    print(\"The genus of bacterium that produces a chemical compound exhibiting triboluminescent properties is:\")\n    print(bacterium_genus)\n\nfind_bacterium_genus()\n```\n<<<Photorhabdus>>>"
