    This function analyzes the provided options and determines the best solution.

    The problem requires a solution that meets four criteria for biometric authentication:
    1. Prevents spoofing and replay attacks.
    2. Prevents authentication by an unwilling (coerced) user.
    3. Remains secure even if the biometric data is stolen (data exposure).
    4. Applies to a wide range of biometric modalities.

    Let's evaluate the options based on these criteria:
    - Options like (D) Liveness Detection and (F) Challenge-Response solve #1 but fail #2 and #3.
    - Options like (J) Hashing, (C) ZKP, and (M) Fuzzy Vaults solve #3 but fail #1 and #2.
    - Options like (E) AI Anomaly Detection and (H) Context-Awareness are the best at solving #2 but fail #3.
    - Option (I) Strong MFA is strong on #1 and #3, but weak on #2 as all factors can be coerced.
    - Option (N) describes a comprehensive system-level solution. It explicitly claims to address all requirements:
        - Spoofing/Replay: Handled by "tamper detection", "hardware enclaves", and preventing "AI manipulation".
        - Coercion: Explicitly states it safeguards against "coercion".
        - Data Exposure: Handled by "quantum-resistant cryptography", "zeroization protocols", and "real-time revocation".
        - Multi-Modality: Supported by its adaptable and reconfigurable architecture.

    Therefore, Option N is the only one that describes a solution meeting all the stipulated cybersecurity requirements.
