    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n\nFirst, I will compile a list of real-world rivers that are explicitly mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid. I will exclude mythological or underworld rivers since their lengths cannot be measured.\n\nSecond, I will research the accepted modern lengths (in kilometers) for each of these identified rivers.\n\nThird, I will sort these rivers in descending order based on their length to find the top three.\n\nFinally, I will present the result in a Python script that stores these rivers and their lengths, then prints the top three longest ones.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest real-world rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n    \n    The script stores a list of prominent rivers mentioned in the text along with their\n    approximate modern lengths.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
