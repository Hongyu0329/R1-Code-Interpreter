def solve_moduli_space_questions():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the theoretical questions about tropical moduli spaces.
    The answers are derived from established results in tropical and algebraic geometry.

    (a) The minimum number of vertices for a stable graph of type (g, A) is determined.
        A non-empty M_trop(g,A) requires 2g - 2 + |A| > 0.
        This condition is equivalent to 2g + |A| >= 3.
        A graph with 1 vertex has valence 2g + |A|, which is >= 3, so it is stable.
        Thus, the minimum number of vertices is 1.

    (b) For g=0, M_trop(0,A) is the Bergman fan of K_n, which is always simplicial.

    (c) For g>0, M_trop(g,A) is the tropicalization of the algebraic moduli space M(g,A)
        and is therefore a tropical variety by definition. Its dimension equals the
        complex dimension of M(g,A), which is 3g - 3 + |A|.
