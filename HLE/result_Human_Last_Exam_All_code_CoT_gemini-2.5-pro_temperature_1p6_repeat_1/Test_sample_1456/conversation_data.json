    "Of course. This is a question in the field of mathematics known as continuum theory, which is a branch of topology. To solve this, we need to combine a few key theorems. I will lay out the plan and then provide a Python script that formalizes the logic.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Terms**:\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   A **nondegenerate continuum** has more than one point.\n    *   The **composants** of a continuum are specific equivalence classes of points. Two points are in the same composant if they are contained in some proper subcontinuum.\n\n2.  **State the Core Theorem for Products**:\n    *   A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that the set of composants of a product space `X x Y` is exactly the set of all products `C_x × C_y`, where `C_x` is a composant of `X` and `C_y` is a composant of `Y`.\n    *   This implies that the number of composants of the product space, `|Comp(X x Y)|`, is the product of the number of composants of the individual spaces: `|Comp(X)| * |Comp(Y)|`. This multiplication is performed using cardinal arithmetic.\n\n3.  **Find the Maximum Number of Composants for a Single Continuum**:\n    *   The next step is to determine the maximum possible number of composants a single nondegenerate continuum can have.\n    *   Some simple continua, like a line segment `[0,1]`, are locally connected and have only **1** composant (the space itself).\n    *   The topologist's sine curve has **2** composants.\n    *   However, there exist continua that have an uncountably infinite number of composants. A classic example is the **Knaster continuum** (also known as the buckethandle). It has **c** composants, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers). This is the maximum possible number.\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**:\n    *   To find the largest possible number of composants for the product `X x Y`, we must choose `X` and `Y` to be continua that each have the maximum possible number of composants.\n    *   So, we set `|Comp(X)| = c` and `|Comp(Y)| = c`.\n    *   The final calculation is the cardinal multiplication `c * c`. In cardinal arithmetic, for any infinite cardinal number `κ`, the product `κ * κ` is equal to `κ`. Therefore, `c * c = c`.\n\nThe Python script below will codify this reasoning, representing the cardinal number `c` as a string and implementing the rule for cardinal multiplication.\n\n```python\ndef cardinal_multiplication(cardinal1, cardinal2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs symbolic multiplication for cardinal numbers.\n    For this problem, we only need the rule c * c = c.\n    \"\"\"\n    if cardinal1 == 'c' and cardinal2 == 'c':\n        return 'c'\n    # This is a simplified function for the scope of this problem.\n    # A real implementation would be more complex.\n    return f\"{cardinal1} * {cardinal2}\"\n\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the largest possible number of composants of the product\n    of two nondegenerate continua.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: State the rule for the number of composants of a product space.\n    # N(X x Y) = N(X) * N(Y), where N is the number of composants.\n    # We need to maximize N(X) and N(Y).\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of composants for a single continuum.\n    # In continuum theory, it is known that the maximum number of composants\n    # for a single nondegenerate continuum is 'c' (the cardinality of the continuum).\n    # An example is the Knaster continuum.\n    max_composants_for_X = 'c'\n    max_composants_for_Y = 'c'\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of composants for the product.\n    # This involves cardinal arithmetic.\n    max_composants_for_product = cardinal_multiplication(max_composants_for_X, max_composants_for_Y)\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final equation as requested.\n    print(\"Let N(S) be the number of composants of a continuum S.\")\n    print(\"The number of composants of a product X x Y is given by the cardinal product: N(X x Y) = N(X) * N(Y).\")\n    print(\"\\nTo maximize this value, we must choose X and Y to have the maximum possible number of composants.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of composants for a single nondegenerate continuum is 'c', the cardinality of the continuum.\")\n    print(f\"\\nSo, we set N(X) = {max_composants_for_X} and N(Y) = {max_composants_for_Y}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation using cardinal arithmetic is:\")\n    \n    # The prompt asks to output each \"number\" (symbolic cardinal) in the final equation.\n    num1 = max_composants_for_X\n    num2 = max_composants_for_Y\n    result = max_composants_for_product\n    print(f\"N(X) * N(Y) = {num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_composants_problem()\n```\n<<<c>>>"
