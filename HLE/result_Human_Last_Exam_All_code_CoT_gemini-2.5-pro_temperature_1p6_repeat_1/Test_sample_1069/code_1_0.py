# The specific solution to the boundary-value problem is x(t) = (2 - e^(-t)) / cosh(t).
# We are asked to find the value of x(t) for t = ln(10^20).

# Define the value of t
t_val = math.log(10**20)

# Calculate the individual components of the equation.
# e^(-t) where t = ln(10^20) is e^(-ln(10^20)) = 10^(-20)
exp_neg_t = math.exp(-t_val)

# For cosh(t), we need e^t as well.
# e^t where t = ln(10^20) is e^(ln(10^20)) = 10^20
exp_t = math.exp(t_val)

# cosh(t) is defined as (e^t + e^-t) / 2
cosh_t = (exp_t + exp_neg_t) / 2

# The numerator of the solution is (2 - e^-t)
numerator = 2 - exp_neg_t

# The full expression for x(t)
result = numerator / cosh_t
