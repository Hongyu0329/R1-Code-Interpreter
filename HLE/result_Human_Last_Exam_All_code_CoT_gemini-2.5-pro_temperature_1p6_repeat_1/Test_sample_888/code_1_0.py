# Step 1: Determine the constants by comparing the derived form of the norm
# with the given parametric form.
# Derived norm: (1/(4*sqrt(lambda))) * (2*l*sqrt(lambda) - sin(2*l*sqrt(lambda)))
# Given form: (1/(K1*sqrt(lambda))) * (K2*l*sqrt(lambda) + K3*sin(K4*l*sqrt(lambda)))

K1 = 4
K2 = 2
K3 = -1
K_4 = 2 # using K_4 to avoid syntax error with K4

# Step 2: Determine the value of K.
# Based on the analysis, K_2 and K_4 are both 2. It is a reasonable
# assumption that the ambiguous constant K is also 2.
K = 2

# Step 3: Calculate the final product.
product = K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K_4

# Step 4: Print the result in the requested equation format.
print(f"The values of the constants are K = {K}, K1 = {K1}, K2 = {K2}, K3 = {K3}, and K4 = {K_4}.")
print(f"The final product is {K} * {K1} * {K2} * {K3} * {K_4} = {product}")
