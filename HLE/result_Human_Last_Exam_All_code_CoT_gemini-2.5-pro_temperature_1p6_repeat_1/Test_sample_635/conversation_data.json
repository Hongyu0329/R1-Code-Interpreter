    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$, we follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Set up the governing equation**: A left factorization must satisfy the equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$, where $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are polynomial matrices.\n2.  **Derive conditions for polynomial matrices**: By substituting $H(s)$ into the equation, we can find the conditions that the elements of $D(s)$ must satisfy to make $N(s)$ a polynomial matrix. The key is to ensure that all denominators in the product $D(s)H(s)$ are canceled.\n    The equation is:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    This leads to the requirement that for each row `i` of $D(s)$, the polynomial `d_i1(s)(s-1)^2 + 2*d_i2(s)` must be divisible by `s^2-1`. This implies two conditions on the row vector `[d_i1(s), d_i2(s)]`:\n    -   `d_i2(1) = 0`\n    -   `2*d_i1(-1) + d_i2(-1) = 0`\n3.  **Find minimal degree solutions**: We find two linearly independent, low-degree polynomial row vectors that satisfy these conditions. These will form the rows of our $D(s)$ matrix. Two such vectors are `[s+1, 0]` and `[1, s-1]`.\n4.  **Construct D(s) and N(s)**: We form $D(s)$ using these row vectors. Then, we calculate the corresponding $N(s)$ matrix using the equation $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$.\n5.  **Verify coprimeness**: A factorization is coprime if the matrix `[D(s) N(s)]` has full row rank for all complex values of `s`. We can verify this by checking the rank at the roots of `det(D(s))`.\n6.  **Present the final result**: We will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to define and print the final matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate and display the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the matrices D(s) and N(s) based on the derivation.\n    # We found two independent row solutions for D(s): [s+1, 0] and [1, s-1].\n    # Let's use these to construct D(s).\n    D_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s + 1, 0],\n        [1, s - 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Corresponding N(s) is calculated as:\n    # Row 1 of N: n11 = s-1, n12 = s+1\n    # Row 2 of N: n21 = 1,   n22 = 1\n    N_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s - 1, s + 1],\n        [1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Print the result in the specified format H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Print D(s)\n    print(\"D(s) = \")\n    for i in range(D_s.rows):\n        row_str = \"[ \"\n        for j in range(D_s.cols):\n            row_str += str(D_s[i, j])\n            if j < D_s.cols - 1:\n                row_str += \", \"\n        row_str += \" ]\"\n        print(row_str)\n    \n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Print N(s)\n    print(\"N(s) = \")\n    for i in range(N_s.rows):\n        row_str = \"[ \"\n        for j in range(N_s.cols):\n            row_str += str(N_s[i, j])\n            if j < N_s.cols - 1:\n                row_str += \", \"\n        row_str += \" ]\"\n        print(row_str)\n\nsolve_factorization()\n```\n<<<A left coprime factorization is given by $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.>>>"
