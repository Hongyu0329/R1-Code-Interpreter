    "To find the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand Graph Sum:** The sum (or join) of graphs \\( G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k \\) is formed by taking the disjoint union of these graphs and adding an edge between every vertex of \\( G_i \\) and every vertex of \\( G_j \\) for all \\( i \\neq j \\).\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Sum:** A key property of the graph sum is that its chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs. For our graph \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\), the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is given by:\n    \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\)\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle \\( C_n \\):** The chromatic number of a cycle graph depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even** (\\( n \\ge 4 \\)), the cycle is a bipartite graph and can be colored with 2 colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd** (\\( n \\ge 3 \\)), the cycle requires 3 colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n4.  **Calculate \\( \\chi(G) \\) for both cases:**\n    *   For an even \\( n \\): \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\).\n    *   For an odd \\( n \\): \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n5.  **Determine the Maximal Value:** To find the maximal chromatic number, we take the largest value from the possible outcomes. Comparing 6 and 9, the maximum is 9.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G which is the\n    sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The chromatic number of a cycle C_n depends on the parity of n.\n    # Case 1: n is even.
