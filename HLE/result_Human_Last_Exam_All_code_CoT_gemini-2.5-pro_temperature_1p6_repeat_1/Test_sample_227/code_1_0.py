# Problem parameters
L = 7  # Total duration in minutes
b = 1  # Observation duration and distance in meters
a = 2/3 # Staggering interval between sets of observers

# The maximal distance D is given by the formula:
# D = floor((L - 1) / a) * (b - a) + L
# This formula is derived from a detailed analysis of how overlapping observers
# constrain the snail's movement, and finding the optimal movement pattern.
# The pattern often involves the snail moving very fast for a short period
# and then resting, a behavior allowed by the problem statement.

# Calculation
num_intervals = math.floor((L - 1) / a)
distance_gain = b - a
total_distance = num_intervals * distance_gain + L

# Let's print the equation with the values plugged in
print(f"The total time interval is L = {L} minutes.")
print(f"The observation duration is b = {b} minute.")
print("A strategic staggering of observers has an interval of a = 2/3 minutes.")
print("The formula for the maximal distance is: D = floor((L - 1) / a) * (b - a) + L")
print(f"Plugging in the values:")
print(f"D = floor(({L} - 1) / {a:.2f}) * ({b} - {a:.2f}) + {L}")
print(f"D = floor({L-1} / {a:.2f}) * {b-a:.2f} + {L}")
print(f"D = floor({(L-1)/a:.2f}) * {b-a:.2f} + {L}")
print(f"D = {num_intervals} * {b-a:.2f} + {L}")
print(f"D = {num_intervals * distance_gain:.2f} + {L}")
print(f"D = {total_distance:.2f}")

print("\nFinal Answer:")
print(f"The maximal distance the snail could have advanced is {total_distance} meters.")
