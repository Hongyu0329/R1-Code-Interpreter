    "My plan is to identify the scientist whose lectures and theoretical work provided the direct foundation for Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. While Einstein's paper had very few formal citations, it was built upon the principles of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat, which were championed by a specific physicist. The Python code will then print the name of this scientist and the context of his influence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_einstein_citation_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the scientist whose lectures\n    and writings were foundational to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    scientist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    year = 1905\n\n    # Although Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion does not contain a formal\n    # citation to a specific lecture, his work is fundamentally based on the principles\n    # of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat developed and taught by\n    # Ludwig Boltzmann.
