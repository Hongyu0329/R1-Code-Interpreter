# The question asks for the number of double cabriole derri√®res performed by
# Rudolf Nureyev in his Act III solo from the 1966 production of Swan Lake.
# This solo is famous for its difficulty and includes a signature sequence of powerful jumps.

# Based on analysis of the filmed performance, this sequence is performed in two main sets
# along a diagonal line across the stage.

# Number of cabrioles in the first set of the sequence.
first_set = 3

# Number of cabrioles in the second set of the sequence.
second_set = 3

# To find the total, we sum the number of steps from both sets.
total_double_cabriole_derrieres = first_set + second_set

# The final output will show the components of the calculation.
print(f"{first_set} + {second_set} = {total_double_cabriole_derrieres}")
