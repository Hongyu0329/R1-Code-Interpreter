# Parameters from the problem description
n = 2025
A = 10**15
B = 10**20

# The solvability condition leads to the relation that for each i,
# (x_i^0/A_i)^2 + (y_i^0/B_i)^2 must be equal to a constant C.
# This constant C is found to be 1 / (n - 1) under the assumption that 1 - exp(-T) -> 1.
# The area S_i of the ellipse for the i-th initial condition pair (x_i^0, y_i^0)
# is given by pi * A_i * B_i * C.
# The total sum of areas S is n * S_i, since A_i and B_i are constant for all i.
# S = n * pi * A * B / (n - 1)
# The value to be found is S / (2025 * pi), which simplifies to S / (n * pi).
# S / (n * pi) = (n * pi * A * B / (n - 1)) / (n * pi) = A * B / (n - 1)

# Calculate the final value
n_minus_1 = n - 1
result = (A * B) / n_minus_1

# Print the final calculation step as requested
# Using scientific notation for A and B for clarity
A_str = "10^15"
B_str = "10^20"
