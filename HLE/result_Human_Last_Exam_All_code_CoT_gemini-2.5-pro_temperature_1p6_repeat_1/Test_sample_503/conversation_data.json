    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ (viewed as a locally posetal 2-category) from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, the left adjoint $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and the right adjoint $g: [n] \\to [m]$, that form a Galois connection. This means they must satisfy the following inequalities for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$:\n$f(g(j)) \\le j$ and $i \\le g(f(i))$.\n\nSuch an adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint $f$ or the right adjoint $g$.\n1.  If we specify the right adjoint $g: [n] \\to [m]$, the only condition it must satisfy is that it is order-preserving and surjective onto the top element, i.e., $g(n) = m$. Given such a $g$, the corresponding left adjoint $f$ is uniquely determined by the formula $f(i) = \\min \\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le g(j)\\}$.\n2.  Dually, if we specify the left adjoint $f: [m] \\to [n]$, the only condition it must satisfy is that it is order-preserving and preserves the bottom element, i.e., $f(0) = 0$. Given such an $f$, the corresponding right adjoint $g$ is uniquely determined by the formula $g(j) = \\max \\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$.\n\nTherefore, counting the number of internal adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is equivalent to counting the number of valid right adjoints $g$ (or left adjoints $f$). Let's use the first approach.\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $g(37) = 23$.\nAn order-preserving map $g: [37] \\to [23]$ is a non-decreasing sequence of integers:\n$0 \\le g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le g(37) \\le 23$.\n\nThe condition $g(37) = 23$ fixes the last element of the sequence. So we must count the number of non-decreasing sequences:\n$0 \\le g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le 23$.\n\nThis is precisely the number of order-preserving maps from $[36]$ to $[23]$. The number of order-preserving maps from $[n']$ to $[m']$ is given by the combination with repetition formula $\\binom{m' + n' + 1}{n'+1}$.\nIn our case, $n'=36$ and $m'=23$. The number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{23 + 36 + 1}{36 + 1} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate the number of internal adjunctions from [23] to [37].\n# This is equivalent to the number of order-preserving maps g: [37] -> [23]\n# such that g(37) = 23.\n# This in turn is equivalent to the number of order-preserving maps from [36] to [23].\n# The formula for the number of order-preserving maps from [n] to [m] is C(m+n+1, n+1).\n# Here, n = 36 and m = 23.\nn = 36\nm = 23\nN = m + n + 1\nK = n + 1\n\n# The number is C(60, 37)\nresult = math.comb(N, K)\n\nprint(f\"The number of adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C({N}, {K}).\")\nprint(f\"C({N}, {K}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<119771579438031120>>>"
