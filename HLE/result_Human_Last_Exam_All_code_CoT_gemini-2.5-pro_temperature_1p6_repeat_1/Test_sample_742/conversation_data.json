    "Of course. Let's break down this complex question.\n\nThe question asks whether the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics can be used to prove Gödel's ontological argument for the existence of God. The short answer is no. The two systems operate in entirely separate logical and philosophical domains.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define Gödel's Proof:** I will first explain that Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument within modal logic. It starts with a set of axioms and definitions (e.g., defining \"God\" as a being possessing all \"positive properties\") and deductively proves that such a being must necessarily exist *within that logical system*. Its validity depends entirely on the acceptance of its initial axioms.\n2.  **Define the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics:** Next, I will explain that the mathematics of quantum mechanics (using tools like Hilbert spaces, operators, and the Schrödinger equation) is a framework for describing the physical behavior of matter and energy at the subatomic level. It is a model of physical reality, tested by experiment.\n3.  **Explain the Incompatibility:** I will then clarify why these two systems are incompatible for this purpose. Quantum mechanics describes physical states and observables, not abstract logical properties like \"goodness\" or \"omnipotence\". Trying to use the mathematics of QM to prove Gödel's argument is a category error, like trying to use the rules of baseball to bake a cake. They are designed for different purposes and operate on different concepts.\n4.  **Illustrative Code:** The Python code below will not attempt the impossible proof. Instead, it will programmatically print a clear explanation of this incompatibility. To fulfill the prompt's unusual constraint of \"outputting each number in a final equation,\" the code will create symbolic, numeric representations of the two systems to visually demonstrate that they are non-interchangeable.\n\n```python\ndef explain_godel_vs_quantum_mechanics():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains why quantum mechanics cannot be used to prove\n    Gödel's ontological proof and illustrates the concept symbolically.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Gödel's Proof vs. Quantum Mechanics ---\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
