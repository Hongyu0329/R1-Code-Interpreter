    "This is a great question that delves into the specific symmetry requirements for different physical properties in crystals. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**1. Defining the Properties based on Symmetry**\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the rotation of the plane of polarized light as it passes through a material. For a crystal to be optically active, it must be **chiral**. A chiral structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry elements, this means the crystal's point group **must not** contain any improper rotation axes (Sₙ), which includes a center of inversion (i or -1) or a mirror plane (m or σ).\n*   **Achiral:** This is the opposite of chiral. An achiral crystal **is** superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group **must** contain at least one improper rotation axis (an inversion center or a mirror plane).\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if its symmetry prevents the formation of a net dipole moment. All point groups that possess a center of inversion (centrosymmetric groups) are non-polar.\n\n**2. Identifying the Contradiction**\n\nThe core of your question lies in a direct contradiction between the definitions:\n\n*   You are looking for crystals that are **optically active**. This requires them to be **chiral**.\n*   You are also looking for crystals that are **achiral**.\n\nA crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time. These are mutually exclusive properties. If a crystal has the necessary symmetry to be optically active (no mirror planes, no inversion center), it is by definition chiral. If it is achiral (has a mirror plane or inversion center), it cannot be optically active.\n\nTherefore, there are no crystal classes that fit all your criteria.\n\nThe following Python script will formally state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the symmetry requirements for optical activity and achirality\n    to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Condition 1: Optical Activity\n    # A crystal must be chiral to be optically active.\n    # Chirality means the crystal's point group LACKS a center of inversion (i)\n    # and mirror planes (m).\n    condition_for_optical_activity = \"must be chiral (lacks i and m)\"\n\n    # Condition 2: Achirality\n    # An achiral crystal is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    # This means its point group MUST HAVE a center of inversion (i) or a\n    # mirror plane (m).\n    condition_for_achirality = \"must be achiral (has i or m)\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the requirements for crystal classes...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Requirement for Optical Activity: The crystal class {condition_for_optical_activity}.\")\n    print(f\"Requirement for being Achiral: The crystal class {condition_for_achirality}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The conditions for being 'optically active' and 'achiral' are mutually exclusive.\")\n    print(\"A crystal class cannot simultaneously lack and possess an inversion center or mirror plane.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, there are no crystal classes that are both achiral and optically active.\")\n    \n# Execute the function to print the explanation.\nfind_crystal_classes()\n\n```\n<<<There are no crystal classes that satisfy these conditions.>>>"
