    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Understand the Hopf Charge**: The Hopf charge of a vector field is a topological invariant. For a field mapping from R³ (compactified to a 3-sphere S³) to a 2-sphere S², it can be calculated as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the S².\n2.  **Choose Two Points**: I will select two convenient points on the target sphere S². A good choice is the South Pole, `p₁ = (0, 0, -1)`, and a point on the equator, `p₂ = (1, 0, 0)`.\n3.  **Find Preimages**: I will find the set of points `(x, y, z)` in the 3D space that map to `p₁` and `p₂`. These preimages, `C₁ = n⁻¹(p₁)` and `C₂ = n⁻¹(p₂)`, will turn out to be curves (loops) in 3D space.\n4.  **Calculate Linking Number**: I will calculate the linking number `Lk(C₁, C₂)` between these two curves. A standard method is to define a surface `D₁` whose boundary is `C₁`, and then count the number of times `C₂` pierces `D₁`, including the direction (sign) of each piercing.\n5.  **Determine the Sign**: The sign of the intersection is determined by comparing the direction of the tangent vector of the piercing curve (`C₂`) with the normal vector of the pierced surface (`D₁`).\n6.  **Construct Python Script**: I will write a Python script that carries out this logic step-by-step, printing the reasoning and calculations, and finally outputting the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field\n    by computing the linking number of the preimages of two points.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the Hopf charge and the method\n    print(\"The Hopf charge is a topological invariant of a vector field.\")\n    print(\"It can be computed as the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the target sphere S^2.\")\n    print(\"The vector field n = (nx, ny, nz) defines a map from R^3 to S^2, since nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = 1.\")\n    print(\"We will calculate the Hopf charge H by finding the linking number Lk(C1, C2), where C1 and C2 are the preimages of two chosen points.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Choose two points on the sphere\n    print(\"Step 1: Choose two points on the target sphere S^2.\")\n    print(\"Let p1 = (0, 0, -1) (the South Pole).\")\n    print(\"Let p2 = (1, 0, 0) (a point on the equator).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the preimage C1 of p1\n    print(\"Step 2: Find the preimage C1 = n^-1(p1).\")\n    print(\"The condition n = (0, 0, -1) implies nz = cos(G) = -1.\")\n    print(\"This means G must be equal to PI.\")\n    print(\"From the definition G = PI * exp(-10 * r2), we get:\")\n    print(\"PI = PI * exp(-10 * r2)  =>  exp(-10 * r2) = 1  =>  r2 = 0.\")\n    print(\"The definition of r2 is sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z*z).\")\n    print(\"r2 = 0 implies (x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 = 0 and z*z = 0.\")\n    print(\"This gives the equations: z = 0 and x*x + y*y = 0.5.\")\n    print(\"So, the preimage C1 is a circle in the xy-plane with radius sqrt(0.5) centered at the origin.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Find the preimage C2 of p2\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the preimage C2 = n^-1(p2).\")\n    print(\"The condition n = (1, 0, 0) implies:\")\n    print(\"nx = sin(G)*cos(f) = 1\")\n    print(\"ny = sin(G)*sin(f) = 0\")\n    print(\"nz = cos(G) = 0\")\n    print(\"From nz = cos(G) = 0, we get G = PI / 2.\")\n    print(\"From G = PI * exp(-10 * r2), we solve for r2:\")\n    print(\"PI/2 = PI * exp(-10 * r2)  =>  exp(-10 * r2) = 0.5  => -10 * r2 = -ln(2)\")\n    R = math.log(2) / 10\n    print(f\"This gives r2 = ln(2) / 10, which is approximately {R:.4f}.\")\n    print(\"From ny = 0, since sin(G)=sin(PI/2)=1, we need sin(f) = 0.\")\n    print(\"From nx = 1, since sin(G)=1, we need cos(f) = 1.\")\n    print(\"sin(f)=0 and cos(f)=1 implies f = 0.\")\n    print(\"f = atan2(y, x) = 0 implies y = 0 and x > 0.\")\n    print(\"Finally, substituting these conditions into the equation for r2^2:\")\n    print(f\"(x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z*z = r2^2 becomes (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2.\")\n    print(\"So, C2 is a closed loop in the half-plane defined by y=0, x>0.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the linking number\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the linking number Lk(C1, C2).\")\n    print(\"We can do this by counting the signed intersections of C2 with a disk D1 bounded by C1.\")\n    print(\"Let D1 be the disk x^2 + y^2 <= 0.5 in the z=0 plane.\")\n    print(\"We orient C1 counter-clockwise (viewed from z>0), so the normal vector to D1 is n_disk = (0, 0, 1).\")\n    print(\"To find where C2 intersects the z=0 plane, we set z=0 in its equation:\")\n    print(f\"(x^2 - 0.5)^2 = {R**2:.4f}  =>  x^2 - 0.5 = +/- {R:.4f}.\")\n    x_sq_1 = 0.5 - R\n    print(f\"Since x > 0, C2 intersects the x-axis at x=sqrt(0.5 - {R:.4f}) and x=sqrt(0.5 + {R:.4f}).\")\n    print(f\"One point has x^2 = {x_sq_1:.4f} < 0.5, so it is inside the disk D1.
