def solve_mystery_translation_challenge():
    """
    This function identifies the correct translation practices for a specific plot device
    and prints the answer in the required format.

    The plot device, common to Asimov's "The Next Day" and Christie's "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter",
    is a pun/mishearing based on English phonetics. The challenge is to make this make sense in another language.

    The evaluated options are:
    I. Transcreation: Finding a new pun in the target language. (Effective)
    II. Embedded audio links: Letting the reader hear the original English pun. (Effective)
    III. Changing the setting: Irrelevant to a phonetic problem. (Ineffective)
    IV. Adding a foreign character: Irrelevant to the reader's comprehension of the translated text. (Ineffective)
    V. Pictorial illustration: Visually explaining the pun. (Effective)
    VI. Footnotes: Textually explaining the pun. (Effective)

    The capable options are I, II, V, and VI.
