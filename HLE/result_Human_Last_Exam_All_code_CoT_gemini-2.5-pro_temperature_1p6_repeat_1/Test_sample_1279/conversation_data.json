    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan and the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:** First, we need to identify all the distinct vacuum bubble Feynman diagrams at the second order for a $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory. The interaction Lagrangian is proportional to $\\lambda \\phi^4$, meaning each interaction vertex has four lines. A second-order diagram contains two such vertices. All lines must originate and terminate at these vertices, with no external lines. There are three such diagrams:\n    *   **The \"Setting Sun\" Diagram:** The two vertices are connected to each other by all four available lines, forming four propagators between them.\n    *   **The \"Saturn\" Diagram:** Two lines from the first vertex connect to the second vertex. The remaining two lines on the first vertex connect to each other, forming a loop. Similarly, the remaining two lines on the second vertex also form a loop.\n    *   **The Disconnected Diagram:** This consists of two separate first-order vacuum bubbles. Each bubble is formed from a single vertex whose lines connect to each other to form two loops.\n\n2.  **Define Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, $S$, for a diagram is the order of its automorphism group. It represents the number of ways the components of the diagram (vertices and propagators) can be permuted without changing the diagram's topology. The contribution of a diagram to any physical quantity is inversely proportional to its symmetry factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate S for Each Diagram:** We will calculate the symmetry factor for each of the three diagrams by considering the permutations of their identical components.\n    *   For the \"Setting Sun\" diagram, we consider the permutations of the two identical vertices and the four identical propagators.\n    *   For the \"Saturn\" diagram, we analyze symmetries from swapping vertices, swapping the propagators between them, and swapping the legs within each self-loop.\n    *   For the disconnected diagram, we first find the symmetry factor of a single first-order bubble and then use it to calculate the symmetry of two identical, non-interacting bubbles.\n\n4.  **Sum the Factors:** Finally, as requested, we will sum the individual symmetry factors to get a total.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python script below. The script will calculate each factor, print the intermediate steps of the calculation, and then print the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams\n    in phi^4 theory and sums them.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Calculating symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: The \"Setting Sun\" Diagram ---\n    # This diagram has two vertices connected by four propagators.\n    # Symmetry arises from:\n    # 1.
