    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Flag of Denmark:** First, I'll establish the rank of the Danish flag. I'll model the flag as a numerical matrix, assigning a unique number to each color. The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This structure creates two distinct types of row patterns: rows that are entirely white (for the horizontal bar of the cross) and rows that are red with a white section (for the field and the vertical bar of the cross). Since these two row patterns are linearly independent and all rows in the flag are of one of these two types, the maximal rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze Flags of African Nations:** Next, I'll search for African flags that also have a maximal rank of 2.\n    *   Flags with only horizontal or only vertical stripes (like Nigeria or Botswana) have all their rows or columns being scalar multiples of each other, resulting in a rank of 1.\n    *   Flags with complex central symbols (like stars or shields, such as on the flags of Somalia or Kenya) or diagonal lines (like on the flag of Namibia) introduce many unique, linearly independent row patterns, resulting in a rank higher than 2.\n    *   The flags that will have a rank of 2 are those with a simple geometric structure that creates exactly two linearly independent row patterns. The \"L-shaped\" design, featuring a vertical band on one side and two horizontal bands on the other, fits this description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script using the `numpy` library to create matrix representations of the flags and calculate their ranks. The script will analyze Denmark's flag, and then the flags of a few representative African nations to demonstrate the principle, ultimately identifying the ones with a rank of 2. The code will print out each flag's name, its matrix representation, and its calculated rank, concluding with the final list of matching flags.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_flag(name, matrix, color_map):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a flag's matrix representation to determine its rank.\n    \n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the country/flag.\n        matrix (np.ndarray): The numerical matrix representing the flag.\n        color_map (dict): A dictionary mapping numbers to color names.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)\n        print(f\"--- Analyzing Flag: {name} ---\")\n        print(\"Color map:\", color_map)\n        print(\"Matrix representation (a simplified model):\")\n        # To make it clear, we print the matrix with integer values\n        print(matrix.astype(int))\n        # The equation for the rank is simply the result of the calculation\n        print(f\"Rank({name}) = {rank}\\n\")\n        return rank\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not analyze {name}: {e}\")\n        return -1\n\n# --- Step 1: Analyze the flag of Denmark ---\n# We represent the Danish flag (red field, white cross).\n# Let Red=1, White=2.
