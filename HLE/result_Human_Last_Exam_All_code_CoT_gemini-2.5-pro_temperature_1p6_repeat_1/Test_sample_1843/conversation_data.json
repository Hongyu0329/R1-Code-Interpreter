    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\n    So, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1^{a_1}} \\chi_{p_2^{a_2}} \\cdots \\chi_{p_k^{a_k}}$, where each $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is a primitive character modulo the prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$ from the factorization of $N$.\n    In our case, a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo $36036$ has the form $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character modulo $p^a$.\n\n3.  **Order Condition:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n    We need this order to be 6. For the lcm to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n    a. The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$, must be a divisor of 6.\n    b. The set of orders of all components must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n\n4.  **Counting Component Characters:** We'll count the number of choices for each primitive component $\\chi_{p^a}$ such that its order divides 6.\n    *   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):** There is only one primitive character, which has order 2. Since 2 divides 6, there is 1 choice.\n    *   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):** The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$. Their orders are 3 and 6. Both divide 6, so there are 4 choices.\n    *   **Modulo 7:** Primitive characters are all non-trivial characters. Their orders are the divisors of $\\phi(7)=6$ greater than 1, which are 2, 3, and 6. All these divide 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(7)-1 = 5$. So, 5 choices.\n    *   **Modulo 11:** Primitive characters have orders that divide $\\phi(11)=10$ (and are > 1), i.e., 2, 5, 10. Among these, only order 2 divides 6. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. So, 1 choice.\n    *   **Modulo 13:** Primitive characters have orders that divide $\\phi(13)=12$ (and are > 1). We need the orders that also divide 6, which are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2 = 5$. So, 5 choices.\n\n5.  **Total Count:** The total number of primitive characters with order dividing 6 is the product of the counts for each component. Let's call this $C$.\n\n6.  **Final Verification:** We must confirm that any character formed this way has an order of exactly 6.\n    *   The choice for $\\chi_4$ must have order 2, so the final order lcm will be a multiple of 2.\n    *   The choices for $\\chi_9$ must have order 3 or 6, so the final order lcm will be a multiple of 3.\n    *   Since the final order is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6.\n    *   Since we already constrained all component orders to be divisors of 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\n    An integer that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be exactly 6. Thus, all characters we have counted have an order of exactly 6.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters\n    of conductor N=36036 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order 6.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Prime factorization of N.\")\n    print(f\"N = 36036 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: A primitive character chi mod N is a product of primitive characters mod p^a.\")\n    print(\"chi = chi_4 * chi_9 * chi_7 * chi_11 * chi_13\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: The order of chi is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components.\")\n    print(\"We need lcm(ord(chi_4), ord(chi_9), ...) = 6.\")\n    print(\"This means each component's order must divide 6.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Count the number of choices for each primitive component whose order divides 6.\")\n    \n    # Modulo 4\n    # The group of characters is isomorphic to (Z/4Z)*, which is cyclic of order 2.\n    # It has one primitive character of order 2. 2 divides 6.\n    count_4 = 1\n    print(f\"For modulus 4 (2^2): There is 1 primitive character (order 2).
