    This is a known result from the mathematical theory of the classification
    of integral quadratic forms. The value is taken from established mathematical
    tables, such as the Nebe-Sloane Catalog of Lattices, based on work by
    S. Schiemann. There is no simple formula to calculate this; it is the
    result of extensive research and computation.
