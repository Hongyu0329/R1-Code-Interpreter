    "My plan is to analyze the provided chess position to determine the optimal move for White.\n\n1.  **Evaluate the initial position**: I will assess the material balance, pawn structure, and the activity and safety of the pieces for both sides. A key threat for Black is often to trade queens with `...Qxf2+`, which would lead to a pawn endgame.\n2.  **Analyze Candidate Moves**: I will examine White's most forcing options. This includes immediate captures like `Qxc5+` and various checks.\n3.  **Endgame Analysis**: For any move that leads to a queen trade, I will evaluate the resulting king and pawn endgame to determine if it's winning, drawing, or losing for White.\n4.  **Forcing Sequences**: I will look for perpetual check sequences, which could allow White to force a draw from a difficult position.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, I will identify the single best move for White and create a Python script that explains the reasoning step-by-step and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given chess FEN and determines the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    fen = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the chess position with FEN:\", fen)\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Position Evaluation ---\")\n    print(\"White is in a difficult position.
