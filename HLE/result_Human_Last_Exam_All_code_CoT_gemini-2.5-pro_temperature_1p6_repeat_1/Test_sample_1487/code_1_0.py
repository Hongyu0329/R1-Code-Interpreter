# The problem is to evaluate the expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# We need to find the value of ||alpha||^2 first.

# From the problem statement and the Riesz Representation Theorem,
# the vector alpha can be represented as a series in the orthogonal system {y_i}:
# alpha = sum_{i=1 to inf} c_i * y_i
# where the coefficients c_i = <alpha, y_i> / ||y_i||^2.
# We are given <y_i, alpha> = z_i = 1 / (i + 1) and ||y_i||^2 = 2.
# For a real Hilbert space, <alpha, y_i> = <y_i, alpha>.
# So, c_i = (1 / (i + 1)) / 2 = 1 / (2 * (i + 1)).

# Now, we calculate the squared norm of alpha using the orthogonality of {y_i}:
# ||alpha||^2 = sum_{i=1 to inf} |c_i|^2 * ||y_i||^2
# ||alpha||^2 = sum_{i=1 to inf} (1 / (2 * (i + 1)))^2 * 2
# ||alpha||^2 = sum_{i=1 to inf} (1 / (4 * (i + 1)^2)) * 2
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * sum_{i=1 to inf} 1 / (i + 1)^2

# The sum is related to the Basel problem: sum_{n=1 to inf} 1/n^2 = pi^2 / 6.
# sum_{i=1 to inf} 1 / (i + 1)^2 = (sum_{n=1 to inf} 1/n^2) - 1/1^2 = pi^2/6 - 1.

# So, ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1).

# Let's perform the calculation.

# 1. The value of the denominator term: pi^2/6 - 1
pi_sq_over_6 = math.pi**2 / 6
denominator_val = pi_sq_over_6 - 1

# 2. The value of ||alpha||^2
norm_alpha_sq = 0.5 * denominator_val

# 3. The other numbers in the final expression
numerator_coeff = 2
constant_term = 10**15

# 4. Calculate the final result
# The expression is (numerator_coeff * norm_alpha_sq) / denominator_val + constant_term
# which simplifies to (2 * 0.5 * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15 = 1 + 10^15
result = (numerator_coeff * norm_alpha_sq) / denominator_val + constant_term

# Output the individual numbers from the expression and the final result.
