def solve_ring_unit_degree():
    """
    Calculates the least degree of a non-trivial unit in the ring R = F_2[x,y]/(y^2 + x^4*y + x + 1).

    The method involves analyzing the degrees of polynomials in the norm equation for units.
    A unit u = a(x) + b(x)y must satisfy the norm equation:
    N(u) = a(x)^2 + a(x)b(x)x^4 + b(x)^2(x+1) = 1.

    Let da = deg(a) and db = deg(b).
    Degree analysis of the norm equation implies that for a non-trivial unit, one of two conditions must hold:
    1. da = db + 4
    2. da = db - 3

    Additional constraints from the norm equation are:
    - da <= 2*db + 1
    - db <= 2*da

    Combining these conditions:
    - For case 1 (da = db + 4): (db + 4) <= 2*db + 1  =>  3 <= db.
      The minimal solution is db=3, da=7.
      The degree of the unit is max(da, db + 1) = max(7, 3 + 1) = 7.
    - For case 2 (da = db - 3): db <= 2*(db - 3)  =>  db <= 2*db - 6  =>  6 <= db.
      The minimal solution is db=6, da=3.
      The degree of the unit is max(da, db + 1) = max(3, 6 + 1) = 7.

    Both cases lead to a minimum degree of 7.
