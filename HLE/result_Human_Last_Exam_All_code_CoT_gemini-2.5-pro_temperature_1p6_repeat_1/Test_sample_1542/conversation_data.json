    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring R=Z/8Z.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables is a polynomial of the form `Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`, where the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are elements of Z/8Z.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, `Q` and `Q'`, are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation `T` such that `Q'(v) = Q(T(v))` for all vectors `v=(x,y)`. Such a transformation `T` is represented by an invertible 2x2 matrix `P` with entries in Z/8Z. A matrix is invertible over Z/8Z if and only if its determinant is a unit in Z/8Z. The units in Z/8Z are {1, 3, 5, 7}.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding the number of orbits of the set of all possible quadratic forms under the action of the group of invertible matrices GL(2, Z/8Z).\n\nA direct computational approach is the most reliable way to find this number. The plan is as follows:\n1.  Generate the set of all 8^3 = 512 quadratic forms, each represented by a tuple of coefficients `(a, b, c)`.\n2.  Generate the group of invertible 2x2 matrices, GL(2, Z/8Z).\n3.  Implement an orbit-counting algorithm. We will iterate through all forms. For each form that has not yet been classified into an orbit, we will treat it as a new representative, compute its entire orbit by applying all possible transformations, and mark all forms in this orbit as classified.\n4.  The total number of representatives found will be the number of equivalence classes.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this strategy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_equivalence_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the finite ring R=Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n    \n    # Generate GL(2, Z/N), the group of invertible 2x2 matrices over Z/N.\n    gl2_zn = []\n    units = {i for i in range(N) if np.gcd(i, N) == 1}\n    for p in range(N):\n        for q in range(N):\n            for r in range(N):\n                for s in range(N):\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % N\n                    if det in units:\n                        gl2_zn.append([[p, q], [r, s]])\n\n    # Generate all possible quadratic forms Q(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2.\n    all_forms = []\n    for a in range(N):\n        for b in range(N):\n            for c in range(N):\n                all_forms.append((a, b, c))\n\n    # Use a set to keep track of forms that are already in an orbit we've found.\n    classified_forms = set()\n    representatives = []\n    \n    for form in all_forms:\n        # If we have already classified this form, skip it.\n        if form in classified_forms:\n            continue\n            \n        # This form is in a new orbit, so it's a new representative.\n        representatives.append(form)\n        a, b, c = form\n        \n        # Calculate the entire orbit of the current representative form.\n        orbit = set()\n        for P in gl2_zn:\n            p, q = P[0][0], P[0][1]\n            r, s = P[1][0], P[1][1]\n            \n            # Applying the transformation P to Q gives a new form Q'.\n            # Q'(v) = Q(Pv).
