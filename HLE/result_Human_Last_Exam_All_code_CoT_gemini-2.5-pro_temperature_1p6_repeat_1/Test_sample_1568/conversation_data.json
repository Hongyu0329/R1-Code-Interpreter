    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Product:** The infinite product starts from `n=3`. I will relate this to the more standard form of a product that starts from `n=1`. This is done by dividing the product from `n=1` to infinity by the first two terms (for `n=1` and `n=2`).\n2.  **Factor the General Term:** The term inside the product is `(1 - z³/n³)`. I will factor this expression using the complex cube roots of unity. The cube roots of 1 are `1`, `ω`, and `ω²`, where `ω = exp(i*2*pi/3)`. The factorization is `(1 - z/n)(1 - z*ω/n)(1 - z*ω²/n)`.\n3.  **Apply the Weierstrass Product for the Gamma Function:** The infinite product representation for the Gamma function `Γ(x)` is a key tool here. The identity is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} = e^{\\gamma x} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} $$\n    where `γ` is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n4.  **Combine Products:** I will form a product of three such identities for `x=z`, `x=zω`, and `x=zω²`. A key property of the cube roots of unity is that their sum is zero (`1 + ω + ω² = 0`). This causes the exponential terms in the product to cancel out, leading to a compact expression for the product `Π(1 - z³/n³)`.\n5.  **Assemble the Final Expression:** I will substitute the result from step 4 back into the expression from step 1 to get the final answer. The resulting expression will be in terms of the Gamma function.\n6.  **Present the Result:** I will write a Python script that prints this final symbolic formula in a clear and readable format, including all the numbers present in the equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n    The formula is derived using the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The symbolic value of the infinite product is:\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"  product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3 / n^3) = \")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"                               1\")\n    print(\"  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"  (1 - z^3 / 1) * (1 - z^3 / 8) * Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1-z*w) * Gamma(1-z*w^2)\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"where 'w' is a complex cube root of unity, w = exp(i * 2 * pi / 3).\")\n    print(\"Gamma(x) is the Gamma function.\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"The numbers present in the final equation are: 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 2, 3.\")\n\nprint_solution()\n```\n<<<$ \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z e^{i2\\pi/3})\\Gamma(1-z e^{i4\\pi/3})} $>>>"
