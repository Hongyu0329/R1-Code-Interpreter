    This problem asks for the thickness of the double point in the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve.
    The thickness 'k' is an integer that describes the type of singularity in the local equation uv = pi^k,
    where pi is the uniformizer (pi=2 in this case).

    The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve y^2 = f(x) is related to the discriminant of f(x).
    Our curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.

    The genus of this curve is g = floor((deg(f)-1)/2) = floor((5-1)/2) = 2.

    For a hyperelliptic curve with potentially semistable reduction, a common heuristic, especially
