Here is a step-by-step explanation of the chemical transformations:

**Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene**
The systematic IUPAC name for this molecule is (3S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane. Its structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Br)-CH₃. It is a chiral molecule.

**Step 1: Elimination to form Product A**
*   **Reaction:** The starting material undergoes an E2 elimination reaction with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically bulky base.
*   **Mechanism:** Due to its bulk, t-BuOK abstracts a proton from the most accessible position, which is the terminal methyl group (C4). This leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene (the Hoffmann product).
*   **Product A:** The product is **4-phenylbut-1-ene**. The original stereocenter is destroyed, so this product is achiral.
    Structure A: Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH₂

**Step 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation to form Product B**
*   **Reaction:** Product A is treated with borane (BH₃) then oxidized with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
*   **Mechanism:** This is a hydroboration-oxidation, which results in the anti-Markovnikov addition of water across the double bond. The hydroxyl (-OH) group attaches to the terminal, less substituted carbon.
*   **Product B:** The product is **4-phenylbutan-1-ol**. This product is also achiral.
    Structure B: Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-OH

**Step 3: Bromination to form Product C**
*   **Reaction:** Product B is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr₃).
*   **Mechanism:** PBr₃ is a standard reagent for converting a primary alcohol into a primary alkyl bromide via an Sₙ2-type reaction.
*   **Product C:** The -OH group is replaced with a -Br atom.
    Structure C: Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-Br

**Identity and Chirality of the Final Product (C)**

The identity of the final product C is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

**Chirality Explanation:**
The final product is **achiral**. The chirality of the starting material was eliminated in the first reaction step, which formed an achiral alkene. The subsequent reactions did not generate any new chiral centers. Therefore, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane has no stereoisomers and does not require an (R) or (S) designation.
