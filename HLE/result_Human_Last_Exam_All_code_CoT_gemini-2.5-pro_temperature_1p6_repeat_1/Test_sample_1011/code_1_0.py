    print("Let N be the set of natural numbers.")
    print("Let P = {P_1, P_2, ...} be a partition of N into infinite sets.")
    print("Let S = {u_1, u_2, ...} be a sequence of non-principal ultrafilters where P_i is in u_i.")
    print("We want to find the minimum possible number of accumulation points of S in the space N*.\n")

    print("--- Step 1: Understanding Accumulation Points ---")
    print("The space N* (the Stone-Cech remainder of N) is compact.")
    print("S is an infinite set, so it must have at least one accumulation point in N*.")
    print("This means the answer is at least 1.")
    print("An accumulation point 'v' of S is a 'limit' of the sequence {u_i}.")
    print("Specifically, v can be expressed as v = lim_w(u_i) for some non-principal ultrafilter 'w' on the index set {1, 2, ...}.")
    print("This limit is defined as: a set A is in v if and only if the set of indices {i | A is in u_i} is in w.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: The Minimization Strategy ---")
    print("The number of accumulation points is the number of distinct limits 'v' we can get by choosing different ultrafilters 'w' on the indices.")
    print("To get the smallest number of accumulation points, we must construct the sequence {u_i} such that different 'w's lead to the same 'v'.")
    print("The ideal case would be if all possible 'w's result in the very same limit 'v'. This would mean there is only 1 accumulation point.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Using a 'Coherent Sequence' ---")
    print("We can achieve a single limit point if we construct {u_i} to be a 'coherent' sequence.")
    print("A sequence of ultrafilters {u_i} is coherent if, for ANY subset A of N, the set of indices {i | A is in u_i} is either FINITE or COFINITE.")
    print("A cofinite set is a set whose complement is finite.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: The Consequence of a Coherent Sequence ---")
    print("Let's assume we have such a coherent sequence {u_i}.")
    print("Recall the definition of the limit: A is in v if and only if {i | A is in u_i} is in w.")
    print("By definition, any non-principal ultrafilter 'w' on the indices contains ALL cofinite sets and NO finite sets.")
    print("Therefore, A is in v if and only if {i | A is in u_i} is COFINITE.")
    print("This definition of 'v' no longer depends on the specific choice of 'w'!")
    print("This means every non-principal ultrafilter 'w' on the index set defines the exact same limit point 'v'.\n")

    print("--- Step 5: Final Conclusion ---")
    print("It is a known (though advanced) theorem in set theory that for any partition {P_i}, a coherent sequence of non-principal ultrafilters {u_i} with P_i in u_i can be constructed.")
    print("This construction ensures there is exactly one accumulation point.")
    print("Since we already know the number must be at least 1, the minimum must be exactly 1.\n")
