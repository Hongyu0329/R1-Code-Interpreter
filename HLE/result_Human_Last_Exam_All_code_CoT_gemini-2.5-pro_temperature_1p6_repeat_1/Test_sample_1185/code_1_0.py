# This problem is a known result from algebraic geometry concerning the classification
# of stable reduction types for curves of genus 2.

# 1. Good Reduction
# This is the case where the curve reduces to a smooth curve of genus 2.
# There is only one type of good reduction.
num_good_reduction = 1

# 2. Bad (but Stable) Reduction
# These are the cases where the curve reduces to a singular stable curve of arithmetic genus 2.
# The classification of these types is a deep result. After excluding semistable types
# that are not truly stable (i.e., those with infinite automorphism groups),
# there are 13 distinct combinatorial types of singular stable fibers.
num_singular_stable_reductions = 13

# 3. Total Number of Types
# The total number of stable reduction types is the sum of the good and the bad (stable) types.
total_types = num_good_reduction + num_singular_stable_reductions

# Print the final calculation and result
print("The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 is calculated as follows:")
print(f"Number of good (smooth) reduction types: {num_good_reduction}")
print(f"Number of bad (singular) stable reduction types: {num_singular_stable_reductions}")
print(f"Total number of stable reduction types = {num_good_reduction} + {num_singular_stable_reductions} = {total_types}")
