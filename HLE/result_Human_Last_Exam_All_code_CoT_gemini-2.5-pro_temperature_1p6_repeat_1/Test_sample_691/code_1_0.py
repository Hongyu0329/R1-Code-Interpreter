# This script calculates the fundamental group of the described topological space.

# Step 1 & 2: Define the structure of the deformation retract graph.
# The space can be simplified to a graph. Let's count its vertices and edges.
#
# Vertices (V):
# 1. The center of the first pair of pants (v1).
# 2. The center of the second pair of pants (v2).
# 3. The junction point for the first pair of leg openings (J1).
# 4. The junction point for the second pair of leg openings (J2).
# 5. The single point where both waistbands are identified (P).
num_vertices = 5

# Edges (E):
# The edges connect the centers of the pants to the identified points.
# - From v1 to P, J1, and J2 (3 edges).
# - From v2 to P, J1, and J2 (3 edges).
num_edges = 6

print(f"The topological space can be simplified to a graph with V = {num_vertices} vertices and E = {num_edges} edges.")

# Step 3: Calculate the rank of the fundamental group.
# The fundamental group of a connected graph is a free group with rank k,
# where k = E - V + 1 (the first Betti number of the graph).
rank = num_edges - num_vertices + 1

# Step 4: Present the final calculation and the resulting group.
# We output each number in the final equation.
print(f"The rank of the group is k = E - V + 1.")
print(f"Substituting the values, we get: k = {num_edges} - {num_vertices} + 1 = {rank}.")
print(f"A free group of rank {rank} is the free product of {rank} copies of the integers (Z).")

# Final result in standard notation
if rank == 1:
    final_group = "Z"
elif rank > 1:
    final_group = " * ".join(["Z"] * rank)
else:
    final_group = "{e} (the trivial group)"

print(f"\nThe fundamental group is: {final_group}")
