    # Step 1: Analyze the molecule
    print("Step 1: Analyzing the molecular structure of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper.")
    print("  - Central atom: Copper (Cu).")
    print("  - Ligand: 2,5-dithiahexane, which has the structure CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3.")
    print("  - This is a bidentate ligand, meaning it binds to the copper atom through two donor atoms, which are the two sulfur (S) atoms.")
    print("  - The prefix 'bis' indicates that there are two of these ligands.")
    print("  - The complete formula is [Cu(CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3)2].")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 2: Determine the coordination geometry
    print("Step 2: Determining the coordination geometry.")
    print("  - The copper atom is bound to two ligands, each with two donor atoms. This gives a total coordination number of 4.")
    print("  - The ligand is neutral. The complex is known to contain Cu(I), which has a d10 electron configuration.")
    print("  - For a d10 metal ion with a coordination number of 4, the geometry is almost always tetrahedral.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 3: Consider the impact of the real ligand structure on symmetry
    print("Step 3: Evaluating the symmetry of the complex.")
    print("  - An idealized tetrahedral complex with two identical bidentate ligands, M(A-A)2, could have D2d symmetry if the ligands were planar.")
    print("  - However, the ligand 2,5-dithiahexane forms a five-membered ring upon coordination (Cu-S-C-C-S).")
    print("  - This chelate ring is not flat; the -CH2-CH2- 'ethylene bridge' is puckered into a gauche conformation.")
    print("  - This puckering is a crucial structural feature that breaks many of the symmetry elements of the idealized D2d point group.")
    print("-" * 30)
    
    # Step 4: Identify the remaining symmetry elements
    print("Step 4: Identifying the symmetry elements in the realistic structure.")
    print("  - In the stable form of the molecule, both puckered rings have the same 'handedness' or chirality.")
    print("  - Let's check for symmetry elements:")
    print("  - Identity (E): Always present.")
    print("  - Proper Rotation Axis (Cn): There is a C2 axis that passes through the Cu atom and relates the two identical ligands. A 180-degree rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.")
    print("  - Mirror Planes (sigma): No. A mirror plane would reflect one puckered ring into its opposite form, which is not present in the molecule. So, there are no mirror planes.")
    print("  - Center of Inversion (i): No. Inverting the molecule through the center would also change the handedness of the rings.")
    print("  - Improper Rotation Axis (Sn): No. The S4 axis present in the idealized D2d geometry is lost due to the puckering of the rings.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 5: Assign the point group
    print("Step 5: Assigning the point group.")
    print("  - The collection of symmetry elements is just the identity (E) and a single C2 axis.")
    print("  - A molecule with only these elements belongs to the C2 point group.")
    print("\nTherefore, the final answer is:")
    print("The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper is C2.")
