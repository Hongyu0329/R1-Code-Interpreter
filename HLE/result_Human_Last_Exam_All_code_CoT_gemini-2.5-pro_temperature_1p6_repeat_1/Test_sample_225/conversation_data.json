    "The user wants to find the number of self-intersection points of the parametric curve defined by `x = cos(9t)` and `y = sin(5t)`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Curve Type:** The equation `(x, y) = (cos(9t), sin(5t))` describes a shape known as a Lissajous curve.\n2.  **Use the Standard Formula:** There is a well-known formula for calculating the number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve `(cos(at), sin(bt))`.\n3.  **Check the Conditions:** The formula for the number of self-intersections, `N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`, is applicable when:\n    *   `a` and `b` are both odd integers.\n    *   The greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is 1 (they are coprime).\n    In our case, `a = 9` and `b = 5`. Both are odd, and `GCD(9, 5) = 1`. The conditions are met.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** I will substitute `a = 9` and `b = 5` into the formula to find the number of self-intersection points.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that defines `a` and `b`, calculates the result using the formula, and prints out the full equation with the numbers substituted, as requested by the user.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The curve is defined by x = cos(at) and y = sin(bt)\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    print(\"The given curve is a Lissajous curve of the form (cos(a*t), sin(b*t)).\")\n    print(f\"For this curve, the parameters are a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n    \n    # Check if a and b are coprime and both odd\n    are_coprime = math.gcd(a, b) == 1\n    are_both_odd = a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0\n\n    if are_coprime and are_both_odd:\n        print(\"\\nSince a and b are coprime and both are odd, we can use the formula for self-intersections:\")\n        print(\"Number of self-intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2\")\n\n        # Calculate the intermediate values\n        a_minus_1 = a - 1\n        b_minus_1 = b - 1\n        numerator = a_minus_1 * b_minus_1\n        \n        # Calculate the final result\n        result = numerator // 2\n\n        print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\n        # The task requires printing each number in the final equation.\n        # So we construct the string carefully.\n        print(f\"Number of self-intersections = ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2\")\n        print(f\"                             = {a_minus_1} * {b_minus_1} / 2\")\n        print(f\"                             = {numerator} / 2\")\n        print(f\"                             = {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The standard formula does not apply because the conditions are not met.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
