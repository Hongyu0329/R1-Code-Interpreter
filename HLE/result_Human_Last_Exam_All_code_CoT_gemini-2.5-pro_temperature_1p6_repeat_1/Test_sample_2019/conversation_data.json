    "To solve this problem, I will use a backtracking algorithm to systematically search for all valid placements of 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Board Representation**: The 5x5 board has 25 squares. I'll iterate through these squares, identified by a single index from 0 to 24 (where `index = row * 5 + col`).\n2.  **Toroidal Attack Rules**: A key aspect is the \"toroidal\" or \"wrap-around\" nature of the board. On an `N x N` board (with `N=5`), a queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a queen at `(r2, c2)` if any of the following conditions are met (using modulo arithmetic):\n    *   Same row: `r1 == r2`\n    *   Same column: `c1 == c2`\n    *   Same diagonal: `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N`\n    *   Same anti-diagonal: `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`\n3.  **Backtracking Algorithm**: I will implement a recursive function to place the queens one by one.\n    *   The function will keep track of how many queens are left to place and the positions of the queens already on the board.\n    *   To avoid counting the same placement multiple times (e.g., placing queens on squares {A,B} is the same as {B,A}), the search for the next queen's position will always start from the index following the previously placed queen.\n    *   For each potential square, I'll check if it's safe from all previously placed queens using the toroidal attack rules.\n    *   If a placement of all 4 queens is successful, I will increment a counter.\n4.  **Final Output**: The script will execute the backtracking search and then print the final count of valid arrangements in the format of an equation, as requested.\n\n```python\n# Set the size of the board and the number of queens.\nN = 5\nNUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n# This global variable will store the total count of valid solutions.\nsolution_count = 0\n\ndef is_safe(new_pos, queens):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a new queen at new_pos is not attacked by any queen in the queens list.\n    The check is performed on a toroidal (wrap-around) board.\n    \n    Args:\n        new_pos: A tuple (row, col) for the new queen.\n        queens: A list of (row, col) tuples for existing queens.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the position is safe, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    r2, c2 = new_pos\n    for r1, c1 in queens:\n        # Check for same row or column (standard attack).\n        if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n            return False\n        # Check for toroidal diagonals.\n        # Two queens are on the same diagonal if (r1-c1) % N == (r2-c2) % N.\n        if (r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N:\n            return False\n        # Check for toroidal anti-diagonals.\n        # Two queens are on the same anti-diagonal if (r1+c1) % N == (r2+c2) % N.\n        if (r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_placements(queens_to_place, start_index, placed_queens):\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses backtracking to find all valid placements for the queens.\n    \n    Args:\n        queens_to_place: The number of queens remaining to be placed.\n        start_index: The linear board index to start searching from.
