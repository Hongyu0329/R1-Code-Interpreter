    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function Z using the path integral formalism in the imaginary time representation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Partition Function (Z):** The starting point in statistical mechanics is the partition function, defined as `Z = Tr[exp(-βH)]`, where `Tr` is the trace, `β` is the inverse temperature, and `H` is the system's Hamiltonian.\n2.  **Introduce Path Integrals:** Feynman's path integral formulation replaces the operator-based trace with a functional integral over classical fields. For fermions, these fields are not ordinary numbers but special anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables.\n3.  **Define the Action (S):** The weight of each field configuration (path) in the integral is determined by the exponential of the Euclidean action, `-S`. This action is an integral of the Lagrangian over the imaginary time `τ` from 0 to `β`.\n4.  **Specify Fermionic Properties:** The key feature that distinguishes fermions from bosons in this formalism is the boundary condition on the Grassmann fields. Due to the properties of the trace and fermion statistics, the fields must be anti-periodic over the imaginary time interval `β`.\n5.  **Assemble the Formula:** Combine these elements into a complete formula for `Z` and `S`, which will be printed by the Python script.\n\n```python\ndef print_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    formula = \"\"\"\nThe fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields ψ*(τ) and ψ(τ):\n\n  Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])\n\nWhere:\n  - ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] represents the functional integral over all possible field configurations.\n  - S[ψ*, ψ] is the Euclidean action.\n\nThe Euclidean action S is defined as:\n\n  S[ψ*, ψ] = ∫[from 0 to β] dτ [ Σ_i ψ_i*(τ) (∂_τ)ψ_i(τ) + H(ψ*(τ), ψ(τ)) ]\n\nHere:\n  - τ is the imaginary time.\n  - β = 1/(k_B T) is the inverse temperature.
