    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Let the number be $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. This number is extremely small, so its decimal representation will start with many zeros. We are interested in the first two digits that are not zero.\n2.  These digits are determined by the significand (mantissa) of the number when expressed in scientific notation, $N = S \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le S < 10$. The first non-zero digits of $N$ are the first non-zero digits of $S$.\n3.  To find $S$, we can use base-10 logarithms. The formula for the significand is $S = 10^{\\log_{10}(N) - \\lfloor\\log_{10}(N)\\rfloor}$.\n4.  We first need to calculate $\\log_{10}(N)$. Using the properties of logarithms, we have $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$.\n5.  This calculation involves a very large number ($7^{13}$) and an irrational number ($\\log_{10}(e)$), so we need to use a high-precision arithmetic library to get an accurate result for the fractional part of $\\log_{10}(N)$. I will use the `mpmath` library in Python for this.\n6.  The steps in the code will be:\n    a. Set a high precision (e.g., 50 decimal places).\n    b. Calculate $y = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$.\n    c. Calculate the significand $S = 10^{y - \\lfloor y \\rfloor}$.\n    d. Convert $S$ to a string, and find the first two non-zero digits from it.\n7.  The final Python code will print out the steps of the calculation and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\ndef find_first_two_nonzero_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of e^(-7^13).\n    The code explains the mathematical steps used for the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a high level of decimal precision for the calculation.\n    # 50 d.p. is more than sufficient for this problem.\n    mpmath.mp.dps = 50\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the first two non-zero digits of N = e^(-7^13).\")\n    print(\"This number is very close to zero.
