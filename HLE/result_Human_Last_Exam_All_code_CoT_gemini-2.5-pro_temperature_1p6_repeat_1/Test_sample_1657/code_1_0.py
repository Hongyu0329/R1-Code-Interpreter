# The problem is unsolvable for two main reasons:
# 1. Missing Information: The initial distance to Pandora is not provided. Without this crucial piece of data,
#    it is impossible to calculate the travel time.
# 2. Computational Constraints: Calculating the onboard time requires relativistic time dilation, which involves
#    the formula sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). The specified Wuxing computer has no `sqrt` function, making this
#    calculation impossible on the target platform.
#
# As per the prompt's instructions, "If you can write such a program... Otherwise, answer 0:0."
# Since we cannot write a program that solves the problem, the correct output is 0:0.
