    # --- Step 2: The deduction for Round 3 ---
    # After two rounds of "No", the four people with white hats can deduce their color.
    # Let's walk through the logic for one person with a white hat, P2 (hat index 2).
    # P2 (hat=0) saw b_seen=3 black hats in round 1.
    # The 3 unseen hats for P2 (h1, h2, h3) must contain 5-3=2 Black and 4-3=1 White hats.
    #
    # P2's hypothesis for Round 3: "Assume my hat is Black (1)".
    # If h2=1, then the other two unseen hats (h1, h3) must be (1B, 0W). So h1=1, h3=0.
    # But P2 also knows that P1 (hat=1) said "No" in Round 2.
    # P2 reasons: "In the world where h2=1 (me=B), h1=1, h3=0, let's analyze P1's R2 reasoning".
    #
    # P1's R2 analysis (as imagined by P2):
    # P1's original hat is 1. P1 sees 3 black hats.
    # P1 would hypothesize: "What if my hat (h1) is White (0)?"
    # If h1=0, its unseen neighbors (h0, h2) must be (2B, 0W).
    # The actual hats of h0 and h2 (in P2's overall hypo) are h0=1, h2=1. This fits.
    # P1 continues: "So if I'm White, h0=B, h2=B. Does this hypothetical world H' break R1 rules?"
    # H' is the original hat configuration, but with h1 flipped to W (0).
    # Let's see what person P8 would see in this world H'=(1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0).
    # P8's view in H': h0,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5 = (1,0,0,0,1,0) -> b_seen=2.
    # A view of 2 black hats would have made P8 say "Yes" in Round 1!
    # So P1 would conclude: "My hat cannot be White." P1 would have said "Yes" in Round 2.
    #
    # Back to P2's reasoning in Round 3:
    # "My hypothesis that I am Black creates a world where P1 should have said 'Yes' in Round 2."
    # "But I know everyone said 'No' in Round 2."
    # "Therefore, my initial assumption must be false. My hat cannot be Black."
    # "My hat must be White."

    # All 4 people with white hats can make this same deduction.
