# The user wants an explanation and a final answer choice for a genetics problem.
# My thinking process outlines the biological reasoning.
# The user also asks for a code block, even though this is a theoretical question.
# I will create a python script that prints out the step-by-step reasoning leading to the answer,
# as a way to fulfill the format requirement.
