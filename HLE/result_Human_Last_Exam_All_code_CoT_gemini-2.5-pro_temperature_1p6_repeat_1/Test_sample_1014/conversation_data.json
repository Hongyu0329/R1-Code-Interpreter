    "My plan is to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881 by implementing a prime factorization algorithm.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  I will start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  The algorithm will first attempt to divide `n` by 2 repeatedly.\n3.  Then, it will iterate through odd numbers `d` (starting from 3) up to the square root of the remaining `n`.\n4.  For each `d`, it will repeatedly divide `n` as long as `n` is divisible by `d`, adding `d` to a list of factors each time.\n5.  If after these steps the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, it means this remaining number is a prime factor itself.\n6.  Finally, I will construct an \"equation\" showing the prime factorization, find the maximum value in the list of factors, and print it as the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds all prime factors of a given number,\n    prints the prime factorization equation, and then prints the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_number = n\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Handle the factor 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n        \n    # Handle odd factors\n    # We iterate from 3 up to the square root of the remaining number n\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n            \n    # This condition handles the case where n is a prime number\n    # greater than 2 (i.e., the remaining n after divisions is prime)\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n        \n    # If the number was prime initially, the factors list will be empty\n    if not factors:\n        factors.append(original_number)\n\n    # Print the prime factorization equation\n    equation = f\"{original_number} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n    print(equation)\n    \n    # Find and print the largest prime divisor\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_number} is: {largest_prime}\")\n    else:\n        # This case is for n <= 1\n        print(f\"There are no prime divisors for {original_number}\")\n\n# The number to analyze\nnumber = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number)\n\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the largest prime divisor of 8139881\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
