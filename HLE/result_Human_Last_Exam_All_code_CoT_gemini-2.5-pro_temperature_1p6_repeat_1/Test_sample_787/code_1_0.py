# Based on the number theory analysis, the limit L is composed of prime factors 2, 3, and 5.
# The exponents for these prime factors are determined by minimizing the p-adic valuations of P(p).

# Exponent for prime 2
p2 = 2
e2 = 10

# Exponent for prime 3
p3 = 3
e3 = 2

# Exponent for prime 5
p5 = 5
e5 = 1

# Calculate the final result
result = (p2**e2) * (p3**e3) * (p5**e5)

# Print the equation and the result
print(f"The limit is {p2}^{e2} * {p3}^{e3} * {p5}^{e5}, which equals:")
