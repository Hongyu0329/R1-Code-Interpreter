def solve():
    """
    This function encapsulates the reasoning and prints the final answer.
    The C++ program is incorrect due to the condition `if(1 <= n && n <= 100)`.
    The maximum number of statements `n` can be up to 121 based on the 366 character tape limit.
    The condition `n <= 100` makes the program fail for valid inputs where 100 < n <= 121.
    The fix is to remove the `if` statement. This involves cutting two lines:
    1. `if(1 <= n && n <= 100) {`
    2. The corresponding closing brace `}`.
    Therefore, the answer is 'N' because the program is incorrect, and '2' for the largest number of lines that can be cut.
