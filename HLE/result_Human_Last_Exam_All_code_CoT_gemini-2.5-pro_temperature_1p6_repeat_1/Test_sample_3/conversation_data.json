    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we need to consult the classification of possible torsion structures for elliptic curves over quadratic fields. This is a deep result in the theory of elliptic curves.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  State the known classification of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve defined over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This result is due to the work of several mathematicians, including Filip Najman's classification for quadratic CM-fields.\n2.  For the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ are of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. The known possible pairs $(m, n)$ are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n3.  Write a Python script to calculate the order (which is $m \\times n$) for each of these groups.\n4.  The script will then find the maximum among these orders and print the group and the calculation that yields this largest order.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over\n    # the quadratic field Q(sqrt(-3)), the possible non-cyclic torsion structures\n    # T = Z_m x Z_n are given by the following pairs (m, n).\n    # This is based on work by F. Najman (2014, \"Torsion of elliptic curves over quadratic CM-fields\").\n    \n    non_cyclic_groups = [\n        (2, 2),  # Z/2Z x Z/2Z\n        (2, 4),  # Z/2Z x Z/4Z\n        (2, 6),  # Z/2Z x Z/6Z\n        (3, 3),  # Z/3Z x Z/3Z\n        (6, 6)   # Z/6Z x Z/6Z\n    ]\n\n    max_order = 0\n    best_group = None\n\n    print(\"The possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups are of the form Z/mZ x Z/nZ.\")\n    print(\"Calculating the order (m * n) for each possible group over Q(sqrt(-3)):\")\n    \n    for m, n in non_cyclic_groups:\n        order = m * n\n        print(f\"For Z/{m}Z x Z/{n}Z, the order is {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n            best_group = (m, n)\n\n    m, n = best_group\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe largest order corresponds to the group Z/{0}Z x Z/{1}Z.\".format(m, n))\n    print(\"The final calculation for the largest order is:\")\n    print(f\"{m} * {n} = {max_order}\")\n\nfind_largest_torsion_order()\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
