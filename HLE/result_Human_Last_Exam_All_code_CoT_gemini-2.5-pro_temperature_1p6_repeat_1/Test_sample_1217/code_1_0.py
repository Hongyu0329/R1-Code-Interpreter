# Description:
# This script evaluates the claim made in options F and I that GRM would have fewer side effects
# than the ADC at the same dosage. It uses data from Experiment 3 to extrapolate the expected
# bone density loss for GRM if it were administered at 10mg/kg, and then compares this
# extrapolated value to the measured side effect of the ADC at 10mg/kg.
# A "fewer" or "lower" side effect corresponds to less bone density loss, which is a value closer to zero.

# Data from Experiment 3 (Bone Density Change at 14 days)
grm_dose_tested = 3.0  # mg/kg
grm_bone_loss = -0.2  # cubic millimeters

adc_dose_tested = 10.0  # mg/kg
adc_bone_loss = -0.3   # cubic millimeters

# The claim is about comparing the drugs at the same dosage, specified as 10 mg/kg.
comparison_dose = 10.0

# We assume a linear dose-response to extrapolate the side effect of GRM.
# Step 1: Calculate the side effect per unit dose for GRM.
side_effect_per_mg_grm = grm_bone_loss / grm_dose_tested

# Step 2: Calculate the expected side effect for GRM at the comparison dose.
extrapolated_grm_bone_loss = side_effect_per_mg_grm * comparison_dose

print("To test the claim, we extrapolate the side effect of GRM from 3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg.")
print("The final equation for the extrapolation is:")
print(f"Extrapolated GRM Side Effect = (Bone Loss at {grm_dose_tested} mg/kg / {grm_dose_tested} mg/kg) * {comparison_dose} mg/kg")

# A "fewer" side effect means a number closer to 0. We check if the extrapolated loss for GRM
# is less than the loss for ADC (i.e., if extrapolated_grm_bone_loss > adc_bone_loss).
