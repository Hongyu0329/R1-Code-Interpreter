    "To find the equilibrium values for the entropy and mean energy of a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta), we can apply principles from statistical mechanics. These principles, which involve maximizing the statistical entropy of the system under physical constraints, are rigorously justified by large deviation theorems such as the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Equilibrium State:** The equilibrium state corresponds to the most probable configuration of the system. For a gas of bosons like photons, this state is found by maximizing the Boltzmann entropy `S = k_B * ln(Ω)`, where `Ω` is the number of microstates for a given macrostate. The maximization is performed under the constraint of a constant total energy, `E`. Since photons can be created and absorbed, their total number is not conserved, which means their chemical potential is zero. This procedure leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution.\n\n2.  **Calculate Mean Energy (E):** The total mean energy of the photon gas at equilibrium can be calculated by integrating the energy of each state (`ε`) weighted by the Bose-Einstein distribution over the density of states for photons. This integration results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy `E` in a volume `V` at temperature `T`:\n    `E = (8 * π^5 * V * (k_B * T)^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)`\n\n3.  **Calculate Entropy (S):** Once the equilibrium energy `E` is known, the entropy `S` can be determined using the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a system with zero chemical potential, `E = TS - PV`. For a photon gas, the pressure `P` is related to the energy density `u=E/V` by `P = u/3`. This leads to the simple relationship:\n    `S = (4 * E) / (3 * T)`\n\n4.  **Execute Python Code:** The following Python script implements these formulas to compute the numerical values for `E` and `S`. We will assume a system with a volume `V = 1.0 m³` at room temperature, `T = 300 K`. The script will display the formulas, the values used in the calculation, and the final results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Explanation ---\nprint(\"This script calculates the equilibrium mean energy (E) and entropy (S) for a photon gas in a defined volume and at a specific temperature.\")\nprint(\"The calculations are based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law and thermodynamic relations derived from the principles of statistical mechanics, which are justified by large deviation theory.\\n\")\nprint(\"System Parameters:\")\nprint(\"Volume (V) = 1.0 m^3\")\nprint(\"Temperature (T) = 300.0 K\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Constants ---\nk_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nh = 6.62607015e-34   # Planck constant (J*s)\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light (m/s)\n\n# --- System Parameters ---\nV = 1.0  # Volume (m^3)\nT = 300.0  # Temperature (K)\n\n# --- Calculation of Mean Energy (E) ---\nprint(\"1.
