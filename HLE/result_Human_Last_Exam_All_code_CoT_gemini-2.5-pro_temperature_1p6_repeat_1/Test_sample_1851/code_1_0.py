    print("   - Since DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2 have different molecular weights, they will appear as two distinct bands, allowing them to be distinguished from each other and from the other three isoforms.\n")

    print(f"Antibody #{antibody_count}: An anti-DNMT3B antibody.")
    print("   - This antibody recognizes proteins from the DNMT3B gene.")
