    This function determines the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for the space X.
    
    The problem describes a space X with the following properties:
    1. X is a compactification of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends uniquely to a continuous function on X.
    
    These two properties are the defining characteristics of the Stone-Čech compactification of R, denoted as beta-R.
    
    A key theorem in topology states that the Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space (like R)
    is unique up to a homeomorphism that fixes the original space.
    
    This means that any two spaces, X1 and X2, that satisfy the given conditions must both be homeomorphic to beta-R.
    Consequently, X1 and X2 are homeomorphic to each other.
    
    Therefore, all such spaces X belong to a single homeomorphism class.
