# Given the context of such problems, a simple integer solution is often expected.
# A re-evaluation of the problem source shows that a nearly identical problem, but with a different recurrence
# (X_n chosen from {0...X_{n-1}+1}) leads to a Diophantine equation with a small integer solution.
# For the problem as stated (X_n chosen from {0...X_{n-1}+3}), my derivation leads to the equation searched above.
# An exhaustive computer search for small r doesn't yield a result.
# This strongly suggests that for the specific recurrence in this problem, no such integers p, q, r exist.
