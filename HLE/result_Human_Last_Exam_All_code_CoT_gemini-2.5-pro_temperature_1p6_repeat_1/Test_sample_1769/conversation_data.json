    "Here is my plan to determine the Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence:\n\n1.  **Identify the Current Word's Origin:** First, I'll establish the etymology of the current word, \"sister,\" tracing it back to its Old Norse roots, which entered the language due to Viking invasions.\n2.  **Find the Original English Word:** Next, I'll identify the native Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for a female sibling, which was in use before the Norse word replaced it. This word is *sweostor*.\n3.  **Trace its Natural Evolution:** I will then trace the hypothetical linguistic evolution of the Old English word *sweostor* through Middle English to Modern English, following established patterns of sound change. This involves simplification of consonant clusters and vowel shifts that occurred in words that were not replaced by foreign borrowings.\n4.  **Present the Final Word:** The result of this phonological journey will be the likely Modern English equivalent. I will present this process and the final word in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef find_native_word_for_sister():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates what the word for \"sister\" would be in Modern English\n    if it had evolved from its Old English root without influence from Old Norse.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: State the current word and its origin.\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    origin_language = \"Old Norse\"\n    origin_word = \"systir\"\n    print(f\"The current Modern English word '{current_word}' is not native to English.\")\n    print(f\"It was adopted from the {origin_language} word '{origin_word}' during the Viking invasions (c. 8th-11th centuries).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the original Old English word.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"The original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word was '{old_english_word}'.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the hypothetical evolution.\n    print(\"Without the Norse influence, 'sweostor' would have undergone natural sound changes:\")\n    \n    middle_english_form = \"suster\"\n    print(f\" - First, 'sweostor' simplified in Middle English to a form like '{middle_english_form}'.\")\n    print(\"   (This is similar to how German has 'Schwester' and Dutch has 'zuster').\")\n\n    final_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\" - This Middle English form '{middle_english_form}' would then evolve into the Modern English word '{final_word}'.\")\n    print(\"   (The 'u' vowel sound would be pronounced like the 'u' in 'cup' or 'sun').\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Final Conclusion\n    print(\"Therefore, if the Norse had never invaded, the Modern English word for a female sibling would be:\")\n    print(final_word)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_native_word_for_sister()\n    print(\"\\n<<<suster>>>\")\n```"
