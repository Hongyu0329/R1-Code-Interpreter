    explanation = """
A Pauli channel is a quantum channel that describes a common type of noise in quantum systems. For a d-dimensional system (qudit), the channel can be written as:

  Λ(ρ) = Σ_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} U_{j,k} ρ U_{j,k}†

Here:
- ρ is the density matrix of the qudit.
- U_{j,k} are the d² generalized Pauli operators, which form a basis for the space of d x d matrices.
- p_{j,k} is a probability distribution (p_{j,k} ≥ 0 and Σ p_{j,k} = 1).

The Kraus operators for this channel are A_{j,k} = sqrt(p_{j,k}) * U_{j,k}.

A fundamental result states that the rank of the complementary channel, denoted as Λ_tilde, is the dimension of the linear span of the set of operators {A_m† * A_n}, where m and n iterate through all the Kraus operators.

  rank(Λ_tilde) = dim(span({A_m† * A_n}))

For the Pauli channel, these operators are:

  A_{j,k}† * A_{j',k'} = sqrt(p_{j,k} * p_{j',k'}) * U_{j,k}† * U_{j',k'}

To find the maximal possible rank, we can choose the probabilities p_{j,k} to be non-zero for all j and k (e.g., p_{j,k} = 1/d²). In this case, the rank is determined by the dimension of the space spanned by all possible products of the Pauli operators:

  Max Rank = dim(span({U_{j,k}† * U_{j',k'}}))

The product of any two Pauli operators, U_a† * U_b, results in another Pauli operator (up to a phase). We can generate any Pauli operator U_{a,b} from this set of products. For instance, if we choose the Pauli operator corresponding to the identity matrix, I (which exists for any d as U_{0,0}), we can generate the entire basis:

  I† * U_{a,b} = U_{a,b}

Since the set of Pauli operators {U_{a,b}} forms a complete basis for the space of all d x d matrices, the span of all their products {U_{j,k}† * U_{j',k'}} is the entire space of d x d matrices.

The dimension of the space of d x d matrices is d². Therefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is d².
