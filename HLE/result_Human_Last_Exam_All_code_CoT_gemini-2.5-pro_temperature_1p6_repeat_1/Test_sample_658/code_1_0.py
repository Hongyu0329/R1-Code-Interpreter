    This function provides the asymptotic value of d_{B,delta}, which is the minimum
    degree of a polynomial p satisfying |p(x) - e^{-x}| < delta for all x in [0, B].

    The asymptotic value A(B, L) is derived from approximation theory,
    where L = log(delta^{-1}). The formula combines two asymptotic regimes:
    1. d ~ sqrt(B*L) for L/B -> 0
    2. d ~ L / log(L/B) for L/B -> oo

    A single expression that captures both behaviors is their sum.
