# The reaction is an E2 elimination.
# The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a trans isomer.
# For E2 on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen must be trans-diaxial.
# The molecule must adopt its less stable diaxial conformation (Br axial, methyl axial) to react.
# In this conformation:
#   - The beta-hydrogen on C2 is equatorial, so elimination to form 3-methylcyclohexene is not possible.
#   - A beta-hydrogen on C6 is axial and anti-periplanar to the axial Br.
# Elimination occurs by removing the H from C6, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.
# The product is the Zaitsev product due to stereochemical constraints.
