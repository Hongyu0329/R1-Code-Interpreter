    "This is an E2 elimination reaction. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Substrate and Reagents**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and bulky base, in tert-butyl alcohol, a polar aprotic solvent. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Substrate**: The (1S,2R) configuration indicates that the bromine at C1 and the methyl group at C2 are on opposite sides of the ring. This is a *trans* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chair Conformations**: A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations:\n    *   **Conformer A (diequatorial)**: The bromine and the methyl group are both in equatorial positions. This is the more stable conformation because bulky groups prefer the equatorial position to minimize steric strain.\n    *   **Conformer B (diaxial)**: The bromine and the methyl group are both in axial positions. This is the less stable, higher-energy conformation.\n\n4.  **Apply the E2 Mechanism Rule**: The E2 elimination reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must both be in **axial positions** and on opposite faces of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down).\n\n5.  **Identify the Reactive Conformation**:\n    *   In **Conformer A (diequatorial)**, the bromine is in an equatorial position. It cannot achieve an anti-periplanar arrangement with any beta-hydrogen. Therefore, this conformer is unreactive towards E2 elimination.\n    *   In **Conformer B (diaxial)**, the bromine is in an axial position. This conformation can undergo E2 elimination, provided there is an axial beta-hydrogen.\n\n6.  **Locate the Beta-Hydrogens**: The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2**: This carbon has the methyl group. In the reactive diaxial conformer (Conformer B), the methyl group is axial. This means the hydrogen on C2 must be equatorial. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it cannot be eliminated with the axial bromine.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is perfectly positioned anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n\n7.  **Predict the Product**: Since elimination is only possible by removing the axial hydrogen from C6, the double bond will form between C1 and C6. The methyl group at C2 remains untouched. This reaction forms only one product.\n\nThe final product name is **1-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\n# The reaction is an E2 elimination.\n# The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a trans isomer.\n# For E2 on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen must be trans-diaxial.\n# The molecule must adopt its less stable diaxial conformation (Br axial, methyl axial) to react.\n# In this conformation:\n#   - The beta-hydrogen on C2 is equatorial, so elimination to form 3-methylcyclohexene is not possible.\n#   - A beta-hydrogen on C6 is axial and anti-periplanar to the axial Br.\n# Elimination occurs by removing the H from C6, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.\n# The product is the Zaitsev product due to stereochemical constraints.\n\nproduct_name = \"1-methylcyclohexene\"\n\nprint(\"The name of the product is:\")\nprint(product_name)\n```\n<<<1-methylcyclohexene>>>"
