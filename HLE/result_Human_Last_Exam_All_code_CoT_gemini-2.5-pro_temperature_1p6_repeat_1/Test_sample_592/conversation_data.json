    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the key elements of your question: the movie \"Ovosodo\" (1997), the character Tommaso, and the US city he moves to.\n2.  This is a factual question about a movie plot. The most direct way to find this information is by consulting a reliable source like a movie database or encyclopedia.\n3.  I have found that in the movie, after a series of events, Tommaso leaves Italy.\n4.  To fulfill the request for a code-based answer, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and then prints a sentence stating the answer clearly.\n\n```python\n# The movie in question\nmovie_title = \"Ovosodo (1997)\"\n\n# The character who moves\ncharacter_name = \"Tommaso\"\n\n# The US city the character moves to, based on the movie's plot\ndestination_city = \"Philadelphia\"\n\n# Print the answer in a clear statement\nprint(f\"In the movie '{movie_title}', the character {character_name} moves to the US city of {destination_city}.\")\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
