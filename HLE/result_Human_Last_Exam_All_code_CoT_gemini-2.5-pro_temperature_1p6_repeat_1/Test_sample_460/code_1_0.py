# Set the parameters given in the problem
t = 20
m = 4

# The problem asks for the smallest integer u such that for all choices of agents and their preferences,
# there exists a "suitable" subset of items O.
#
# A subset O is suitable if:
# (1) For every item j in O, the number of agents who pick it as their favorite from O is greater than t.
# (2) For every item k not in O, the number of agents that prefer k over all items in O is at most u.
#
# This problem can be solved using a result from social choice theory, which provides a direct
# formula for the minimum value of u that guarantees a suitable set exists.
# The formula is: u = (m - 1) * t
#
# This value is proven to be both sufficient (a suitable set can always be found if u is this large)
# and necessary (a counterexample can be constructed if u is any smaller).

# Calculate the smallest value of u using the formula
u = (m - 1) * t

# Print the final equation with each number, as requested.
print(f"The formula for the smallest suitable u is: u = (m - 1) * t")

print(f"u = ({m} - 1) * {t}")
print(f"u = {m-1} * {t}")
