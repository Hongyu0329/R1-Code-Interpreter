# The reasoning above shows that because the space is not compact,
# there exists a family of closed sets with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP)
# whose intersection is the empty set.
# The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
# Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality of the intersection is 0.
