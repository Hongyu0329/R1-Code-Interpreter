    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the number and type of atoms:** Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The core orbital (1s) is represented by **1** contracted function.\n        *   The valence orbitals (2s, 2p) are split. The inner part (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) uses **4** contracted functions (1 for s, 3 for p), and the outer part also uses **4** contracted functions.\n        *   Total for Carbon = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** contracted functions.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n        *   It has no core electrons. The valence orbital (1s) is split. The inner part uses **1** contracted function, and the outer part uses **1** contracted function.\n        *   Total for Hydrogen = 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = **2** contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Sum the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s) = 2\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the contribution from each type of atom\ncarbon_contribution = num_carbon_atoms * funcs_per_carbon\nhydrogen_contribution = num_hydrogen_atoms * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions\ntotal_functions = carbon_contribution + hydrogen_contribution\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation\nprint(f\"For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms}):\")\nprint(f\"Each of the {num_carbon_atoms} Carbon atoms uses {funcs_per_carbon} contracted functions.\")\nprint(f\"Each of the {num_hydrogen_atoms} Hydrogen atoms uses {funcs_per_hydrogen} contracted functions.\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the total:\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = ({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {funcs_per_carbon} funcs/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {funcs_per_hydrogen} funcs/H)\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = {carbon_contribution} + {hydrogen_contribution}\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
