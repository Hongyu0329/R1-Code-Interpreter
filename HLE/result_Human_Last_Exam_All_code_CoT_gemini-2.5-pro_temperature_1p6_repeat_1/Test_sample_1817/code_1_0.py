    Analyzes the options based on the Domain Model pattern principles

    A. Inappropriate. Puts business logic in the wrong layer (Controller), creating an anemic domain.
    B. Inappropriate. Creates a "God Object" (Order class), violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
    C. Appropriate. Correctly assigns responsibilities to the relevant domain entities.
    D. Inappropriate. Leads to an anemic domain model by placing all logic in a service, which is the Transaction Script pattern, not the Domain Model pattern.
    E. Appropriate. A balanced approach where entities contain their own logic and services orchestrate them.
