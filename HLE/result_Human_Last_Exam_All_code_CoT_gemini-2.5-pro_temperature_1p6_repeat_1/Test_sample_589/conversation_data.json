    "The user wants to identify a specific scene from a Hollywood movie.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Analyze the key visual and contextual clues from the user's request:\n    *   **Actor:** A teenager.\n    *   **Object:** A pink bike.\n    *   **Action:** Pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n    *   **Production:** Hollywood feature film from a major studio.\n2.  Search through a mental database of films, particularly coming-of-age movies from the 80s and 90s where bicycles are prominently featured.\n3.  Initial thoughts might lead to films like *It* or *Pretty in Pink*, but upon closer inspection, they do not match all the criteria. In *It*, none of the main characters have a pink bike. In *Pretty in Pink*, the iconic vehicle is a pink car, not a bike.\n4.  A more targeted search reveals the correct film is *Now and Then* (1995), produced by New Line Cinema.\n5.  I will verify that all elements of the query are present in a scene from this film:\n    *   **Teenager:** The main characters are 12-year-old girls, which fits the general \"teenager\" context for a coming-of-age film. The character in question is Chrissy Dewitt.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** Chrissy is known for her pink Schwinn bike.\n    *   **Action:** In a scene where the girls confront the local bullies (the Wormer brothers), Chrissy panics and accidentally pedals directly into the path of their oncoming car, forcing it to swerve into a ditch.\n    *   **Major Studio Film:** Yes, produced by New Line Cinema.\n6.  To fulfill the user's request format, I will present this information using a Python script with print statements.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and describes a specific movie scene based on a detailed query.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"Now and Then\"\n    release_year = 1995\n    studio = \"New Line Cinema\"\n    character = \"Chrissy Dewitt\"\n    scene_description = (\n        \"In the 1995 film 'Now and Then', there is a scene where the four main \"\n        \"characters confront the local bullies, the Wormer brothers. During the \"\n        \"standoff, the character Chrissy Dewitt (who is 12 years old) panics \"\n        \"while on her pink Schwinn bicycle and pedals directly toward the \"\n        \"Wormer brothers' oncoming car. This forces the car to swerve off the \"\n        \"road and into a ditch.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"Movie Title: {film_title}\")\n    print(f\"Release Year: {release_year}\")\n    print(f\"Studio: {studio}\")\n    print(\"\\nScene Details:\")\n    # Wrap the text for better readability in the console\n    print(textwrap.fill(scene_description, width=80))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
