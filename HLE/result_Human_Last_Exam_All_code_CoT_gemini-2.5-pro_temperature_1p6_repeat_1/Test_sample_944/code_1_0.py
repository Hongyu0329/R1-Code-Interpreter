Step-by-step derivation to find the maximum cardinality:

1.  **Understanding the Terms**
    *   **X:** A compact, connected, locally-connected metric space. Such a space is also known as a Peano continuum. Think of it as a space that is path-connected and 'well-behaved' locally, without infinitely spiraling points. Examples include simple shapes like lines, circles, and squares, but also more complex fractals.
    *   **Cyclic Element (S):** A subset of X is called cyclic if it cannot be disconnected by removing a single point. A cyclic element is a *maximal* such set. For example, a circle is a cyclic element. A line segment is not, because any interior point disconnects it.

2.  **A Key Theorem about Intersections**
    A fundamental result in continuum theory states that the intersection of two distinct cyclic elements, say S1 and S2, can contain at most one point.
    *   |S1 ∩ S2| ≤ 1

3.  **Characterizing the Set of Interest**
    We are looking for the maximum cardinality of the set P, defined for a cyclic element S as:
    P = {x ∈ S | x belongs to some other cyclic element T, where T ≠ S}

    This set P is the union of all intersections of S with other cyclic elements:
    P = U (S ∩ T) for all cyclic elements T ≠ S.

    Since each intersection |S ∩ T| is at most one point, the cardinality of P, |P|, is simply the number of other cyclic elements that S intersects.

4.  **Constructing an Example for Maximization**
    To maximize |P|, we need to construct a space X with a cyclic element S that intersects the largest possible number of other cyclic elements.

    *   Let's choose our cyclic element S to be a simple circle. A circle is a Peano continuum and a cyclic element.
    *   We can attach other cyclic elements to S at different points. Let's choose other circles as these other cyclic elements.
    *   Let A be a set of points on the circle S. For each point p ∈ A, let's attach a new circle T_p such that T_p intersects S only at p (i.e., T_p is tangent to S at p) and T_p does not intersect any other T_q.
    *   The resulting space is X = S ∪ (∪_{p∈A} T_p).
    *   For this construction to result in a Peano continuum (compact, connected, locally-connected), the set of attachment points A must be a closed subset of S.
    *   The set P for our circle S is now precisely the set of attachment points A. Thus, |P| = |A|.

5.  **Finding the Maximum Cardinality of A**
    The question now becomes: what is the maximum possible cardinality of a closed subset A of a circle S?
    *   A circle has the cardinality of the continuum, which is denoted 2^{ℵ₀} (or 'c').
    *   We can choose A to be a set with this cardinality. For example, we can take A to be the set of points on the circle whose angles correspond to the numbers in the Cantor set. This set is closed and has cardinality 2^{ℵ₀}.
    *   With this choice of A, we have constructed a space where |P| = 2^{ℵ₀}.

6.  **Proving This is the Maximum**
    Could the cardinality be even larger?
    *   The space X we are considering must be a compact metric space. A property of such spaces is that they are separable, which implies their total cardinality cannot exceed 2^{ℵ₀}.
    *   Since P is a subset of X, its cardinality is bounded by the cardinality of X.
    *   Therefore, |P| ≤ |X| ≤ 2^{ℵ₀}.

7.  **Conclusion**
    We have constructed an example where the cardinality is 2^{ℵ₀} and shown that it cannot be larger. Thus, the maximum possible cardinality is 2^{ℵ₀}.
