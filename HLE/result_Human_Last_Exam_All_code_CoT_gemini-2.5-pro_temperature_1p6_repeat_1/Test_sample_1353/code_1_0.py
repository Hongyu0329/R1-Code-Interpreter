    # For a full sl(2) string, the lowest-weight and highest-weight states have symmetric bi-degrees.
    # If the starting (lowest-weight) polynomial has bi-degree (a, b), the terminal
    # (highest-weight) polynomial has bi-degree (b, a).

    # Part b: Provide the condition for a string starter.
    # The condition relates the bi-degree (a,b) to the indices {r_i} and n.
    # Based on a plausible construction method starting from the Vandermonde determinant
    # of degree C(n,2), the condition is that the sum of the x-degree 'a' and the
    # sum of the indices 'r_i' equals the maximal x-degree C(n,2).

    # Part c: Determine if a specific polynomial construction is possible.
    # The question is whether a polynomial of bi-degree (5, 2) can be constructed
    # using specific operators.
    # Interpreting the operators E_{r,0} as E_r = sum_i y_i^r * d/dx_i, we find that
    # such a construction is possible by applying E_2 to a (6,0) polynomial or E_1 twice
    # to a (7,0) polynomial. These base polynomials exist for n >= 4 or n >= 5 respectively.
    # Therefore, the construction is possible.
