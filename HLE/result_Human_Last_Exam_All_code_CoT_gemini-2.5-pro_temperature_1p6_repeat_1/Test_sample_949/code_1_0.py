    Analyzes the six statements about parenthesis strings.

    Based on the detailed analysis:
    1. sum(log L) = O(sum(log D)): True. For various string families, the sums scale similarly. The leaf-node contributions often dominate, ensuring the O-relationship holds.
    2. sum(loglog L) = O(sum(loglog D)): True. Same reasoning as above. The function grows even slower, making it harder to find a counterexample.
    3. sum(log^5 L) = O(sum(log^5 D)): True. Same reasoning.
    4. sum(2^sqrt(log L)) = sum(2^O(sqrt(log D))): True. Interpreting the statement as sum(LHS) = O(sum(RHS)), the leaf-node dominance argument holds again.
    5. sum(L^0.1) = O(sum(D^0.11)): True. The exponent on L is smaller than on D, which helps. For cases where L grows exponentially in D (L~k^D), the summation is dominated by leaves, not the root, because 0.1 < 1.
    6. sum(sqrt[4]{L}) = O(sum(sqrt{D})): True. This is L^0.25 vs D^0.5. Again, the summation is dominated by leaf nodes because 0.25 < 1.

    All statements appear to be true because for any structure where a few pairs have a large L/D ratio, those pairs must contain a vast number of sub-pairs whose contributions dominate the total sum and restore the balance.
