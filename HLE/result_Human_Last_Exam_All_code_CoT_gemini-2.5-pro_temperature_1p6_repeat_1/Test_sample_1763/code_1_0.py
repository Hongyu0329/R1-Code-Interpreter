# This problem is a known question in topology. The answer is based on a
# classification theorem of infinite topological spaces. It is not derived
# from a numerical calculation but from identifying the number of distinct,
# minimal infinite topological types that can be found as subspaces.
# The 7 types are:
# 1. The discrete space on a countable set.
# 2. The indiscrete space on a countable set.
# 3. The initial segment topology on a countable set.
# 4. The final segment topology on a countable set.
# 5. The cofinite topology on a countable set.
# 6. A space homeomorphic to the rational numbers (Q).
# 7. A space homeomorphic to a convergent sequence (e.g., {1/n} U {0}).
#
# The cardinality of this family of topological types is 7.
