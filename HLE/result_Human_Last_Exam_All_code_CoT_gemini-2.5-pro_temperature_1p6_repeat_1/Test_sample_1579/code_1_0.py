# According to a 2006 theorem by Regina Rotman, for any Riemannian two-sphere,
# there exists a simple closed geodesic of length L satisfying the inequality:
# L^2 <= C * Area
# where C=31 is the best known constant as of 2024.
# From this, we can find the upper bound for the length L: L <= sqrt(C * Area).
