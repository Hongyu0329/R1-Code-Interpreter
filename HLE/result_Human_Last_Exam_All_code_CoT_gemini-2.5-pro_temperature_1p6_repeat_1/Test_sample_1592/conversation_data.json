    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec.\n\nFirst, I will establish the precise geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish.\n\nSecond, I will identify the provinces and territories that are geographically closest to Quebec: Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut.\n\nThird, for each of these neighbors, I will identify the coordinates of a point on their border that is nearest to Waskaganish. For Ontario, this will be a point on the land border to the west. For New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, it will be a point on their northernmost and westernmost borders, respectively. For Nunavut, the closest point is on Akimiski Island, which lies in James Bay.\n\nFinally, I will use Python's `geopy` library to calculate the geodesic distance (the shortest path on the Earth's surface) from Waskaganish to each of these border points. By comparing these distances, I will determine which province or territory is the closest.\n\n```python\nimport geopy.distance\n\ndef find_closest_province():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, QC, from a list of candidates.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coordinates for Waskaganish, Quebec\n    waskaganish = (51.4886, -78.7694)\n\n    # Coordinates for the nearest points of surrounding provinces/territories\n    locations = {\n        \"Ontario\": (51.4886, -79.5167),  # A point on the ON-QC land border due west of Waskaganish\n        \"Nunavut\": (52.88, -80.88),        # Southeast tip of Akimiski Island, Nunavut, in James Bay\n        \"Newfoundland and Labrador\": (52.94, -66.82), # Point on the QC-Labrador border near Labrador City\n        \"New Brunswick\": (48.05, -67.50)     # Northernmost point of the NB-QC border\n    }\n\n    distances = {}\n    print(\"Calculating distances from Waskaganish, QC:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Calculate distance to each location\n    for province, coords in locations.items():\n        dist = geopy.distance.geodesic(waskaganish, coords).km\n        distances[province] = dist\n        print(f\"Distance to the {province} border: {dist:.2f} km\")\n\n    # Find the minimum distance\n    closest_province = min(distances, key=distances.get)\n    min_distance = distances[closest_province]\n\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"The closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_province}.\")\n    print(f\"The distance to its border is approximately {min_distance:.2f} km.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_closest_province()\n```\n<<<Ontario>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
