    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we need to calculate the dimension of the subspace of homogeneous elements of degree 10 in the free Lie algebra generated by two elements (X and Y). This dimension is given by Witt's formula.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the parameters for Witt's formula**: For this problem, the degree is `n = 10` and the number of generators is `k = 2`.\n2.  **Apply Witt's Formula**: The formula is  $L_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$, where the sum is over the positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n3.  **Implement the necessary components**:\n    *   A function to find all divisors of `n=10`.\n    *   A function to compute the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n4.  **Calculate and Print**: I will write a Python script that calculates each term of the sum, displays the full equation with all numbers plugged in, computes the total sum, and divides by `n` to get the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    # Find divisors up to the square root of n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Möbius function mu(n).\n    - mu(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    - mu(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    prime_factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % d == 0:\n            prime_factors.append(d)\n            temp_n //= d\n            # If the same factor divides again, n is not square-free\n            if temp_n % d == 0:\n                return 0\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        prime_factors.append(temp_n)\n        \n    # Return based on the parity of the number of distinct prime factors\n    return -1 if len(prime_factors) % 2 != 0 else 1\n\ndef calculate_bch_coefficients(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients for a given order n and k generators\n    using Witt's formula and prints the step-by-step calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order n={n} for k={k} generators.\")\n    print(\"Using Witt's formula: L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum over d|n (mu(d) * k^(n/d))\\n\")\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divisors}\\n\")\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    term_values = []\n\n    print(\"Calculating each term 'mu(d) * k^(n/d)' for each divisor d:\")\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power_val = n // d\n        k_power_n_div_d = k ** power_val\n        term = mu_d * k_power_n_div_d\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        print(f\"d={d}: mu({d}) * {k}^({n}/{d}) = {mu_d} * {k}^{power_val} = {mu_d} * {k_power_n_div_d} = {term}\")\n        \n        equation_parts.append(f\"({mu_d} * {k}^{power_val})\")\n        term_values.append(str(term))\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # Constructing and printing the final equation\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # Show the formula with numbers\n    equation_str = f\"(1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(equation_parts)} ]\"\n    print(equation_str)\n    \n    # Show the formula with terms calculated\n    sum_str = ' + '.join(term_values).replace('+ -', '- ')\n    print(f\"= (1/{n}) * [ {sum_str} ]\")\n    \n    # Show the result of the sum\n    print(f\"= (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\")\n    \n    # Show the final answer\n    print(f\"= {result}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is {result}.\")\n\n# Parameters for the specific problem\norder_n = 10\ngenerators_k = 2\n\ncalculate_bch_coefficients(order_n, generators_k)\n```\n<<<99>>>"
