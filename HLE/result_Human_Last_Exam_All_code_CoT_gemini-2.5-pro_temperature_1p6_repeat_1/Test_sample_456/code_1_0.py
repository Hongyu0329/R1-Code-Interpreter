    This function analyzes the image augmentation options for the given camera trap scenario.

    The deployment scenario involves a camera with fixed settings:
    - Lighting: Fixed brightness infrared. This makes augmentations related to color (I, J) and brightness (A, B, C) largely irrelevant, as the deployment images will be monochromatic and have consistent illumination.
    - Shutter Speed: A fast 1/500s shutter speed minimizes motion blur, making motion blur augmentation (H) less critical.
    - Camera Position: Fixed.

    The primary source of variation in the images will be the animals themselves. An animal can pass through the ravine from left to right, or from right to left. The training data, scraped from a general source like GBIF, might have a directional bias (e.g., more profile shots of animals facing left).

    - A Vertical Flip (E) is unrealistic and would likely harm accuracy.
    - A Horizontal Flip (F) is the most crucial augmentation. It teaches the model that an animal's identity is independent of its direction of travel (left vs. right). This directly addresses the most significant and predictable variation in the deployment setting, effectively doubling the utility of the training data for different animal orientations.

    Therefore, the horizontal flip is the single most important augmentation for improving deployment accuracy.
