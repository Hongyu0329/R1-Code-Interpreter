    Calculates the integral of the product of lambda classes lambda_3*lambda_2*lambda_1
    on the moduli of stable curves of genus 3.

    The problem is to compute the integral:
    integral_{M_3_bar} lambda_3 * lambda_2 * lambda_1

    The dimension of the space M_3_bar is 3*3 - 3 = 6.
    The degree of the class lambda_3 * lambda_2 * lambda_1 is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
    Since the degrees match, the integral is a rational number.

    This value is a known result in algebraic geometry, famously computed by
    Faber and Pandharipande. This function directly returns that result.
