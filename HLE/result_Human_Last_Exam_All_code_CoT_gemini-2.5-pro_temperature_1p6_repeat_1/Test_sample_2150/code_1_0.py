    # Clue 2: A poem by Yuri Krasnokutsky describes a cold stream flowing through the blood of 'X'.
    # The poem is "Холодная струя течет по жилам Терека...", meaning "A cold stream flows through the veins of the Terek...".
    # 'X' is the Terek River. A major city on the Terek is the capital of North Ossetia-Alania.

    # Clue 3: The Croatian gastronomic paradise "Dolac" has a nickname made up of two words, one of which is a toponym.
    # In what city was its main analogue situated?
    # Dolac market in Zagreb is nicknamed "The Belly of Zagreb" (Trbuh Zagreba).
