    This function explains the reasoning and prints the solution to the problem.

    The problem asks for the maximum number of r-vertices in the interval ]0, 1[
    for a simple dessin d'enfant.

    The argument for the solution is as follows:
    1. Assume there are two or more r-vertices in ]0, 1[. Let's call them r_1, r_2, ...
    2. Between any two r-vertices on the real line, there must be a p- or q-vertex (a non-special node).
    3. Any such real non-special vertex must satisfy strong conditions: valency 4 and all neighbors must be real.
    4. This forces a specific graph structure where vertices on the real-line path are connected to other real vertices via off-path "double edges".
    5. Following these rules introduces r-vertices in different structural positions (e.g., on-path vs. off-path).
    6. Condition (iii) requires all r-vertices in ]0, 1[ to have the same valency.
    7. The different structural positions of the r-vertices make it impossible for them to all have the same valency. This leads to a contradiction.
    8. Therefore, the assumption of having two or more r-vertices must be false. The number of r-vertices must be less than 2.
    9. A configuration with one r-vertex is possible. For example, a single r-vertex with all p- and q-vertices existing outside the ]0, 1[ interval.

    This means the maximum possible number of r-vertices is 1.
