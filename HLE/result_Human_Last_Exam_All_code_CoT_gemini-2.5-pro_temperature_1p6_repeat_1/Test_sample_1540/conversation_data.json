    "Of course, I can help you with this task.\n\nFirst, I will outline the plan to solve the problem. Then, I'll provide a Python script to perform the case-insensitive string comparison. Finally, I will analyze the most memory-efficient C implementation to determine the memory usage for its variables.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Solve the String Comparison Problem:**\n    *   The core task is to compare two strings lexicographically, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.\n    *   I will write a Python script that reads the two input strings.\n    *   To ignore case, the script will convert both strings to lowercase using the `.lower()` string method.\n    *   Finally, it will use Python's built-in comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`) to compare the two lowercase strings and print `-1`, `1`, or `0` accordingly.\n\n2.  **Analyze Memory for an Efficient C Program:**\n    *   The second part of the task is to determine the total memory `m` in bytes used for variables in the most memory-efficient C program for this problem.\n    *   To store the input strings (up to 100 characters), the C program needs two character arrays. To account for the null terminator (`\\0`), each array must have a size of at least 101. So, `char str1[101];` and `char str2[101];` will be used, consuming `101 + 101 = 202` bytes.\n    *   A loop is required to iterate through the strings and compare them character by character. We need a loop counter variable. Since the string length is at most 100, the counter will go from 0 to 99. The most memory-efficient data type for this range is a `char`, which uses only 1 byte.\n    *   Therefore, the total memory for variables (`m`) will be the sum of the memory for the two arrays and the single-byte counter.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the first string from standard input\n    s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Read the second string from standard input\n    s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    s1_lower = s1.lower()\n    s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n    # Perform the lexicographical comparison\n    if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n        print(-1)\n    elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n        print(1)\n    else:\n        print(0)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<203>>>"
