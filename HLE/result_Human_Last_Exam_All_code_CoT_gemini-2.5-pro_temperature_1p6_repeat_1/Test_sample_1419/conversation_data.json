    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in the `φ^4` theory near four dimensions, we will use the renormalization group (RG) method. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function**: The RG flow of the dimensionless coupling `u` is described by the beta function, `β(u)`. In `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for `φ^4` theory is `β(u) = -ϵu + Bu²`, where `B` is a constant that depends on the normalization and the number of field components. For a single scalar field, `B = 3 / (16π²)`.\n\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point**: A fixed point `u*` is a value of the coupling where the RG flow stops, meaning `β(u*) = 0`. We need to solve this equation for `u*`.\n\n3.  **Solve for `u*`**: Setting the beta function to zero gives `-ϵu* + B(u*)² = 0`. This equation has two solutions: the trivial (Gaussian) fixed point `u* = 0` and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point `u* = ϵ / B`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Expression**: By substituting the value of the constant `B` into the expression for `u*`, we can find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of `ϵ`.\n\nThe following Python code will carry out the final step of this plan by assembling the components of the expression and printing the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script derives and prints the leading order expression for the \n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, u*, in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n\n    The derivation starts with the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling 'u'\n    in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions:\n        β(u) = -εu + B*u^2\n\n    For the standard single-component scalar field theory (O(1) model), the constant B is:\n        B = 3 / (16 * π^2)\n\n    A fixed point u* is a point where the beta function is zero, i.e., β(u*) = 0.\n    Solving for the non-trivial fixed point (the Wilson-Fisher fixed point) gives:\n        -εu* + B*(u*)^2 = 0\n        => u* = ε / B\n    \n    This script calculates the coefficient of ε and prints the final expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the constants from the calculation of the beta function.\n    # The coefficient B of the u^2 term is composed of these numbers.\n    numerator_B = 3\n    denominator_B_coeff = 16\n\n    # The fixed point coupling u* is given by ε / B.\n    # Substituting B gives:\n    # u* = ε / (3 / (16 * π^2))\n    # which simplifies to:\n    # u* = (16 * π^2 / 3) * ε\n    \n    # We will now assemble and print this final expression.\n    # The components for the coefficient of ε are:\n    numerator_u_star_coeff = denominator_B_coeff\n    denominator_u_star_coeff = numerator_B\n\n    # Use unicode characters for a clear mathematical representation.\n    epsilon_char = \"\\u03B5\"\n    pi_char = \"\\u03C0\"\n\n    print(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in terms of \\u03B5 is:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with all its numerical components.\n    print(f\"u* = ({numerator_u_star_coeff} * {pi_char}\\u00b2 / {denominator_u_star_coeff}) * {epsilon_char}\")\n\n# Run the function to display the result.\nsolve_fixed_point_coupling()\n```\n<<<(16*π^2/3) * ε>>>"
