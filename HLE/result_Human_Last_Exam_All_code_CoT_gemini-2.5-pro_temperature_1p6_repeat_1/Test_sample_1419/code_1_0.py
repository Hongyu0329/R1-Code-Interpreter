    This script derives and prints the leading order expression for the 
    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, u*, in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.

    The derivation starts with the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling 'u'
    in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions:
        β(u) = -εu + B*u^2

    For the standard single-component scalar field theory (O(1) model), the constant B is:
        B = 3 / (16 * π^2)

    A fixed point u* is a point where the beta function is zero, i.e., β(u*) = 0.
    Solving for the non-trivial fixed point (the Wilson-Fisher fixed point) gives:
        -εu* + B*(u*)^2 = 0
        => u* = ε / B
    
    This script calculates the coefficient of ε and prints the final expression.
