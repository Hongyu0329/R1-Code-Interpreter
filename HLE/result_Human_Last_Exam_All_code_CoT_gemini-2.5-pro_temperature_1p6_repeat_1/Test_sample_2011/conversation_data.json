    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a graph with 128 vertices.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the terminology. The term \"clique\" can sometimes be ambiguous.\n1.  It can mean any complete subgraph.\n2.  It can mean a *maximal* clique (a clique that cannot be extended by adding another vertex).\n\nIf we use the first definition, the answer is trivially 128. We can construct a complete graph on 128 vertices, `K_128`. In this graph, any subset of `k` vertices induces a `K_k`. Thus, we can find induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128, for a total of 128 different sizes.\n\nHowever, this type of problem in a computational context usually implies a more complex combinatorial challenge. The second interpretation, using maximal cliques, provides such a challenge. A single `K_128` graph has only one maximal clique (itself), giving only one size. Therefore, we will proceed with the assumption that the question is asking for the maximum number of different **maximal clique** sizes.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n\n1.  **Construct a Graph:** To maximize the number of different maximal clique sizes, the most efficient construction is a graph consisting of a disjoint union of cliques. Let this graph `G` be composed of cliques `K_{s_1}, K_{s_2}, ..., K_{s_m}` where all `s_i` are distinct positive integers. Each of these components `K_{s_i}` is a maximal clique in `G`.\n2.  **Formulate the Constraint:** The total number of vertices in this graph is the sum of the sizes of the cliques: `s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_m`. This sum must not exceed the total number of available vertices, `n = 128`.\n3.  **Optimize:** To maximize `m` (the number of different sizes), we should choose the smallest possible distinct integers for the clique sizes `s_i`. So, we will use sizes `1, 2, 3, ...`.\n4.  **Solve:** The problem reduces to finding the largest integer `m` such that the sum of the first `m` positive integers (`1 + 2 + ... + m`) is less than or equal to 128.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the value of `m`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The total number of vertices available in the graph.\nn = 128\n\n# Variables to keep track of the calculation.\ntotal_vertices_used = 0\nnum_different_sizes = 0\nclique_sizes = []\n\n# This loop determines the maximum number of different clique sizes (m)\n# by summing the smallest possible distinct sizes (1, 2, 3, ...)\n# until the total number of vertices required exceeds n.\nwhile True:\n    # The next smallest size to try.\n    next_size = num_different_sizes + 1\n    \n    # Check if adding a clique of this new size is possible.\n    if total_vertices_used + next_size <= n:\n        total_vertices_used += next_size\n        clique_sizes.append(next_size)\n        num_different_sizes += 1\n    else:\n        # If we cannot add a clique of this size, we have found our maximum.\n        break\n\nprint(f\"The task is to find the maximum number of different maximal clique sizes in a graph with n = {n} vertices.\")\nprint(\"To achieve this, we construct a graph composed of disjoint cliques of the smallest possible different sizes (1, 2, 3, ...).\")\nprint(\"We need to find the largest number of such cliques whose total vertices do not exceed 128.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculation involves summing the clique sizes until the limit is reached.\")\n\n# Format the equation string as requested.\nequation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, clique_sizes))\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation representing the sum of vertices for the chosen cliques is:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {total_vertices_used}\")\n\nremaining_vertices = n - total_vertices_used\nprint(f\"\\nThis construction uses {total_vertices_used} vertices out of {n}, leaving {remaining_vertices} unused.\")\nprint(f\"The next clique size to consider would be {num_different_sizes + 1}.\")\nprint(f\"Adding it would require a total of {total_vertices_used} + {num_different_sizes + 1} = {total_vertices_used + num_different_sizes + 1} vertices, which exceeds {n}.\")\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is the number of terms in the sum.\")\nprint(f\"The answer is {num_different_sizes}.\")\n\n```\n<<<15>>>"
