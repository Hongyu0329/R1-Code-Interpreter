    # Based on the retrosynthetic analysis of the product 'ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate'
    # formed from a Robinson annulation with methyl vinyl ketone, the starting material is determined.
    
    # Key deductions:
    # 1. The reaction is a Robinson annulation.
    # 2. The -COOEt group at the bridgehead (4a) indicates the starting material was a beta-ketoester.
    # 3. The final position of the methyl group (4) and the specific cyclization pathway allow for mapping the
    #    substituents back to the starting cyclohexane ring.
    # 4. The mapping indicates the methyl group was at position 6 of the starting material.
