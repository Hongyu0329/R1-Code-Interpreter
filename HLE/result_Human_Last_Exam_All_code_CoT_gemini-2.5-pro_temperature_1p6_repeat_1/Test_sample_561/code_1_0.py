# Step 1: Define the parameters of the fractal from the problem description.

# N: The number of copies.
# The fractal is generated by replacing each black key with a smaller copy of the entire keyboard.
# A standard piano octave has 5 black keys. So, at each step, we create 5 copies.
N = 5

# s_x: The scaling factor for the width.
# This is the ratio of a black key's width to the entire keyboard's width.
# Keyboard width (W) = 3 units.
# A white key's width is W/7 = 3/7.
# A black key's width (w_b) is half of a white key's, so w_b = (3/7)/2 = 3/14.
# The scaling factor s_x = w_b / W = (3/14) / 3 = 1/14.
s_x = 1.0/14.0

# s_y: The scaling factor for the height.
# This is the ratio of a black key's height to the entire keyboard's height.
# Keyboard height (H) = 1 unit.
# A black key's height (h_b) is given as 9/14 of the keyboard height, so h_b = 9/14.
# The scaling factor s_y = h_b / H = (9/14) / 1 = 9/14.
s_y = 9.0/14.0

# Step 2: Use the formula for the box-counting dimension of a self-affine fractal.
# The dimension D for a self-affine set generated by N copies with scaling factors
# s_x and s_y is given by the formula D = (log(N) + log(s_y) - log(s_x)) / (-log(s_x)).
# Let's substitute our scaling factors into this formula and simplify:
# D = (log(5) + log(9/14) - log(1/14)) / log(14)
# Using log rules (log(a/b) = log(a)-log(b)):
# D = (log(5) + (log(9) - log(14)) - (log(1) - log(14))) / log(14)
# Since log(1) = 0:
# D = (log(5) + log(9) - log(14) + log(14)) / log(14)
# D = (log(5) + log(9)) / log(14)
# Which is also log(45) / log(14).

# Step 3: Calculate the numerical value.
# The numbers in the final simplified equation are 5 (from N), 9 (from s_y), and 14 (from s_x and s_y).
