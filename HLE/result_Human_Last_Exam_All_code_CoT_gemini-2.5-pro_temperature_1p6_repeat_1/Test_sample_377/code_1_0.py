    # Step 1 & 2: Theoretical reduction
    # The problem is to find the number of blocks of kG.
    # G = D \rtimes S, where D = (C_2)^2 is a normal 2-subgroup.
    # The field k has characteristic 2.
    # By Fong's First Theorem, since D is a normal p-subgroup (p=2),
    # the number of blocks of kG is the same as the number of blocks of k[G/D].
    
    # Step 3: Identify the quotient
    # G/D is isomorphic to S = 3^{1+2}_+.
    
    # Step 4 & 5: Analyze kS
    # The order of S is 27. char(k)=2. Since gcd(27, 2) = 1, kS is semisimple.
    # For a semisimple algebra over a large enough field (splitting field),
    # the number of blocks is the number of conjugacy classes of S.

    # For a non-central element x in S, its conjugacy class size is p.
