    "Of course. The names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are listed within a specific section of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'. I will provide a Python script that identifies this range, prints the relevant verses (bayt), and gives the final answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish the standard numbering for the verses of the poem.\n2.  Identify the exact starting and ending verses that contain the names of the prophets. According to scholarly consensus on the text, the names begin in Bayt (verse) 21 and conclude in Bayt 24.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores these four verses.\n4.  The script will then loop through and print each verse number and its corresponding text in Arabic for clarity.\n5.  Finally, the script will print a concluding sentence stating the precise range.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the verses from 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the prophets in Islam.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Verses (bayt) from the poem containing the names of the 25 prophets.\n    # The numbering is based on the standard text.\n    prophet_verses = {\n        21: \"هُمْ آدَمٌ ادْريسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ * صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n        22: \"لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\",\n        23: \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n        24: \"إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\"\n    }\n\n    start_bayt = 21\n    end_bayt = 24\n\n    print(\"The names of the prophets in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned in the following verses:\\n\")\n\n    for number, text in prophet_verses.items():\n        print(f\"Bayt {number}: {text}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    # Printing the numbers for the final answer as requested\n    print(f\"The names are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_prophet_verses()\n\n```\n<<<from bayt 21 to bayt 24>>>"
