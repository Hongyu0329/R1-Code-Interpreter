    "Of the sequences you provided, S1, S2, and S3 are defined by relatively simple recurrence rules. The sequence S4, however, does not appear to follow a straightforward rule and may contain a typo, as it does not match any common, named integer sequences exactly.\n\nA famous sequence with a similar recursive, self-referential nature is the Hofstadter Q-sequence. It's plausible that this was the intended sequence.
