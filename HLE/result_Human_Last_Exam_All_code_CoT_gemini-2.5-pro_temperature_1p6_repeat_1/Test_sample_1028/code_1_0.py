    print("--- Evaluating All Strategies ---\n")
    print("The core problem: Without direct evidence of extinction, we can't uniquely determine the historical speciation (λ) and extinction (µ) rates from the tree of survivors alone.\n")

    print("A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces:")
    print("   - Verdict: WEAKLY HELPS/NEUTRAL. It simplifies continuous functions into fewer parameters (20 in this case). It is a way to specify a less complex model than a fully continuous one, but does not guarantee identifiability.\n")

    print("B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework:")
    print("   - Verdict: HELPS. Priors add external information to the model, which constrains the parameters to plausible values and prevents the likelihood from being the sole source of information, thus regularizing the problem.\n")

    print("C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5:")
    print("   - Verdict: DOES NOT HELP. This strategy massively increases model flexibility and the number of parameters (to 120). Introducing more complexity and flexibility without adding new data or constraints makes the identifiability problem worse.\n")

    print("D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors in the phylogeny:")
    print("   - Verdict: HELPS. Fossils provide direct evidence of past diversity and extinction events. This is one of the most powerful ways to add the information needed to separate the signals of speciation and extinction.\n")

    print("E. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate:")
    print("   - Verdict: HELPS. The pulled diversification rate (rate of diversification of lineages that survive to the present) is a parameter combination that has been proven to be identifiable from an extant-only phylogeny. This strategy focuses on what can be known.\n")

    print("F. Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny:")
    print("   - Verdict: HELPS. Similar to D, adding fossil data, even just as extinct tips on the tree, provides hard data points on when lineages existed and went extinct.\n")

    print("G. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate:")
    print("   - Verdict: HELPS. The pulled speciation rate is another identifiable parameter combination. Like E, this is a valid reparametrization strategy that avoids the identifiability issue.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Strategy C makes the model much more complex and flexible, which directly worsens the identifiability problem. All other options either add new data/information (B, D, F) or cleverly reparametrize the model to focus on identifiable components (E, G). Therefore, C is the only strategy that does not help.")
