    This function calculates the exact value of the limit lim_{N->inf} p(N)/N.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    The limit is the sum of contributions from each of the 51^7 possible coefficient tuples.
    A coefficient tuple C=(a,...,g) contributes a non-zero value to the limit only if the polynomial
    P(F_m) = -(a*F_m^6 + ... + g) is a constant. This happens only when a=b=c=d=e=f=0.
    In these cases, the equation simplifies to F_n = -g.

    The contribution to the limit for such a tuple is k_g, the number of integer solutions 'n' for F_n = -g.
    We sum k_g for all possible g in [-25, 25] to find the total limit.
