    "My plan is to first identify the key information from your query: the painting \"The Radionist\", the artist Kurt G端nther, the year of creation 1927, and the year of acquisition 1967. I will then use this information to determine the acquiring museum. Finally, I will create a Python script that stores these details in variables and prints a clear, formatted sentence to answer your question, including all the specified numbers.\n\n```python\ndef solve_art_history_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's question about the painting \"The Radionist\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the known variables based on the user's query and external knowledge.\n    painting_title = \"The Radionist\"\n    artist = \"Kurt G端nther\"\n    creation_year = 1927\n    acquisition_year = 1967\n    \n    # The painting was acquired by the Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery),\n    # which is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections).\n    acquiring_museum = \"Galerie Neue Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden\"\n\n    # Print the final answer in a full sentence, including the numbers from the query.\n    print(\n        f'The {creation_year} tempera painting \"{painting_title}\" by {artist} '\n        f'was acquired in {acquisition_year} by the {acquiring_museum}.'\n    )\n\nsolve_art_history_query()\n```\n<<<Galerie Neue Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which museum acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt G端nther in 1967?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
