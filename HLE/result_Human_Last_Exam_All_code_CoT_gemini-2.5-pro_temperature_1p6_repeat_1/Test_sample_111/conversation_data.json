    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n1.  **Establish the Date:** First, I need to determine the exact year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n2.  **Trace Chaucer's Location:** Next, I will look into Geoffrey Chaucer's historical records to find out his known location and occupation during that specific year.\n3.  **Synthesize the Information:** By combining the date of death with Chaucer's whereabouts, I can deduce where he was at the time.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that prints out the historical facts and the logical conclusion that leads to the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_chaucers_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes historical data to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location\n    at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the date of death.\n    year_of_death = 1368\n    print(f\"Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died in the year {year_of_death}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine Chaucer's status and location around that time.\n    print(\"By this time, Geoffrey Chaucer was well-established in royal service in England.\")\n    print(\"He was an esquire (a member of the royal household) to King Edward III.\")\n    print(\"His service in the English court would have kept him in England unless he was on a specific diplomatic mission.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Check for known travel.\n    print(f\"Chaucer's first recorded diplomatic journey to Italy did not occur until 1372, several years after {year_of_death}.\")\n    print(\"There is no historical record of him being in France, Italy, or Scotland in 1368.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Conclude his location.\n    print(\"\\nGiven his role in the royal court and the lack of evidence of foreign travel at the time, it is certain that Geoffrey Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died.\")\n    print(\"His famous poem, 'The Book of the Duchess', was written in England in her memory shortly after her death.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: England.\")\n\nfind_chaucers_location()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
