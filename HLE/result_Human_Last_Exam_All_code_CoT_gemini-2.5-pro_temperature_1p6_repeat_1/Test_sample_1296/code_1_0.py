    # --- Part (a) ---
    # Question: If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # 1. The problem states G acts quasiprimitively on the face set F. By definition,
    #    this means every non-trivial normal subgroup of G is transitive on F.
    # 2. The socle N is a non-trivial normal subgroup of G.
    # 3. Therefore, N must be transitive on the face set F.
    # 4. The faces of the quotient dessin D_N correspond to the orbits of N on F.
    # 5. Since N is transitive, it has only one orbit on F.
    # 6. Consequently, D_N has exactly one face, which means it is unicellular.
    #    This conclusion does not depend on G/N being cyclic.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # --- Part (b) ---
    # Question: Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism
    #           group of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # 1. A smooth covering D -> D_N implies the valencies and face length are the same.
    #    For the group generators g (representing rotations), this means |g| = |gN|.
    # 2. This condition implies that the cyclic subgroup <g> intersects the socle N trivially.
    # 3. For types TW (G = T wr Z_l) and AS (G = N.H where H <= Out(N)), this would
    #    require generating G with elements whose orders are determined by their images in
    #    the quotient G/N. It's a known group-theoretic result that such groups cannot
    #    be generated by such elements, as they cannot generate the non-abelian socle N.
    # 4. For type HA (Holomorph of Abelian, e.g., an affine group G = N.H), it is
    #    possible to find generators satisfying the |g|=|gN| condition which generate G.
    answer_b = "HA"

    # --- Part (c) ---
    # Question: True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a
    #           smooth covering of D_N.
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # 1. As explained in part (b), a group G of type TW cannot be the automorphism
    #    group of a smooth covering of D_N.
    # 2. This reasoning is general and does not depend on the specific value of l,
    #    as long as l > 1. The argument holds for l in {2, 3, 4, 5}.
    # 3. Therefore, the statement is a correct application of the general principle.
    answer_c = "True"
