# The number of special points in the metric continuum X.
num_special_points = 5

# Step 1: Explain the problem in terms of graph theory.
# The problem can be modeled by a complete graph K_v, where v is the number of special points.
# The vertices of the graph are the special points {a, b, c, d, e}.
# The subcontinua A_i in the decomposition correspond to the edges of the graph.

# Step 2: Translate the conditions for the decomposition into graph properties.
# - The condition that the union of A_i must be the whole space X means the subgraph
#   formed by the selected edges must be connected.
# - The condition that each A_i has a part not covered by the others means the
#   subgraph must not contain any cycles.

# Step 3: Identify the resulting graph structure.
# A connected graph with no cycles is a tree. We want the largest number of
# subcontinua (n), which corresponds to the maximum number of edges in such a tree.

# Step 4: Calculate the number of edges in a tree.
# For a tree with v vertices, the number of edges is always v - 1.
v = num_special_points
n = v - 1

# Step 5: Print the final calculation and result.
print(f"The number of special points (v) is: {v}")
print("The largest number of subcontinua (n) in the decomposition corresponds to the number of edges in a spanning tree on these points.")
print("The number of edges in a tree with v vertices is calculated as v - 1.")
print(f"Calculation: {v} - 1 = {n}")
print(f"The largest number n is {n}.")
