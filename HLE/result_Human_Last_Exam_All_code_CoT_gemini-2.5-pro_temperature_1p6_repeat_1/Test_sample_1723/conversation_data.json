    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n1.  First, I need to identify the core of your request. You are asking for the name of the single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print. This is a knowledge-based question from the field of mycology.\n2.  Next, I will search my knowledge base to find the correct answer to this specific question.\n3.  Finally, as per your instructions, I will provide the answer using a Python script that prints the name of the genus.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the mushroom genus that is famously\n# associated with the color blue, particularly due to the characteristics\n# of one of its most well-known species, Lactarius indigo.\n\ndef find_blue_mushroom_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the mushroom genus known for blue features.\n    While a true blue spore print is exceptionally rare or non-existent in mycology,\n    this genus is the one most famously associated with the color blue.\n    \"\"\"\n    genus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n    print(genus_name)\n\nfind_blue_mushroom_genus()\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    There is a single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print, what is its name?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
