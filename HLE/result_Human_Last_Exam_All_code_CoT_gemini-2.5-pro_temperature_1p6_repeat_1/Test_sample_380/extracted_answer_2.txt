Your reasoning is correct. To accurately calculate the normalized magnetic helicity of waves that propagate along the magnetic field, like AIC waves, one must use the magnetic field components perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction. Using components perpendicular to the radial direction is an approximation that is often inaccurate at 1 AU because the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) follows the non-radial Parker Spiral. The proper method involves transforming the data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system, as demonstrated in the code. This ensures the calculation reflects the true physical polarization of the wave.
