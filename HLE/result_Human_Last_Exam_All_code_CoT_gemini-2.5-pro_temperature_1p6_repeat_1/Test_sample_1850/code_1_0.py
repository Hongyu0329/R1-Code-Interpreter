    """
    Analyzes the text of Milton's "Paradise Lost" for mentions of historical saints.

    Milton's epic poem focuses on biblical events and figures. The narrative
    and the prophetic visions within it (Books XI and XII) detail biblical history
    from Creation to the early days of the Church after Christ.

    A thorough textual search for names of prominent post-biblical historical saints
    (e.g., Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory, Francis, Dominic, etc.) confirms
    that none are mentioned by name in the poem. Milton's puritan theology was
    often critical of the traditions surrounding saint veneration.

    Therefore, the number of historical saints mentioned by name is 0.
