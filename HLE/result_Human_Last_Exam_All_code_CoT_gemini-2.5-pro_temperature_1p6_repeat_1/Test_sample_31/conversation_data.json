    "To determine the number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to identify any PLL case, we need to find the minimum number of stickers that guarantees we can distinguish every case from every other case. This requires a worst-case analysis.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question**: The phrase \"must be seen\" implies we're looking for a number, N, such that observing *any* N stickers guarantees we have enough information. This is different from finding a small, specific set of stickers to check.\n2.  **Identify the Worst-Case Scenario**: The most difficult cases to distinguish are two that are identical across the largest possible number of sticker positions. The worst case will be distinguishing the solved state from the PLL case that moves the fewest pieces.\n3.  **Find the \"Quietest\" PLL**: We will identify the PLL algorithm that moves the minimum number of pieces on the last layer. The more pieces that remain stationary, the more stickers will be identical to the solved state. The U-Permutations move the fewest pieces (cycling 3 edges).\n4.  **Count the Stationary Stickers**: We will calculate the number of non-top-facing stickers that are on the pieces left untouched by a U-Permutation.\n5.  **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle**: To guarantee that we see at least one sticker on a piece that has been moved (which is necessary to detect the permutation), we must see one more sticker than the total number of stationary stickers. This will be our final answer.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan and calculates the final number, explaining each step of the logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be\n    seen to guarantee identification of any PLL case.\n\n    The reasoning is based on a worst-case analysis to find a number N\n    such that viewing any N stickers is sufficient to identify the case.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Step 1: Identifying the Worst-Case for Recognition ###\")\n    print(\"To guarantee identification, we must consider the hardest-to-distinguish cases.\")\n    print(\"This occurs when we try to differentiate the 'solved' state from a PLL case that moves the fewest pieces, as they will share the most identical sticker positions.\")\n    print(\"The U-Permutation moves the fewest pieces: it cycles 3 edges, leaving all 4 corners and the remaining 1 edge stationary.\\n\")\n\n    # Cube and piece parameters\n    total_corners = 4\n    total_edges = 4\n    side_stickers_per_corner = 2\n    side_stickers_per_edge = 1\n\n    # U-Permutation piece movement\n    moved_edges = 3\n\n    print(\"### Step 2: Counting Stickers on Stationary Pieces for a U-Perm ###\")\n    # Calculate how many pieces are stationary\n    stationary_corners = total_corners\n    stationary_edges = total_edges - moved_edges\n    print(f\"A U-Perm leaves {stationary_corners} corners and {stationary_edges} edge stationary.\")\n\n    # Calculate the number of stickers on those stationary pieces\n    stickers_on_stationary_corners = stationary_corners * side_stickers_per_corner\n    stickers_on_stationary_edges = stationary_edges * side_stickers_per_edge\n    total_stationary_stickers = stickers_on_stationary_corners + stickers_on_stationary_edges\n    print(f\"The number of non-top stickers on the {stationary_corners} stationary corners is: {stationary_corners} * {side_stickers_per_corner} = {stickers_on_stationary_corners}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of non-top stickers on the {stationary_edges} stationary edge is: {stationary_edges} * {side_stickers_per_edge} = {stickers_on_stationary_edges}.\")\n    print(f\"Total number of stickers that remain unchanged in a U-Perm case is: {stickers_on_stationary_corners} + {stickers_on_stationary_edges} = {total_stationary_stickers}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"### Step 3: Applying the Pigeonhole Principle ###\")\n    print(f\"If a solver looks at only {total_stationary_stickers} stickers, it is possible they chose only stickers that are unaffected by the U-Perm.\")\n    print(\"In that scenario, the cube would appear identical to the solved state, and the PLL case could not be identified.\")\n    print(\"To guarantee seeing at least one sticker on a moved piece, a solver must look at one more sticker than the total number of stationary stickers.\\n\")\n\n    # The final calculation\n    min_stickers_for_guaranteed_id = total_stationary_stickers + 1\n    print(\"### Conclusion ###\")\n    print(f\"The minimum number of stickers that must be seen is {total_stationary_stickers} + 1 = {min_stickers_for_guaranteed_id}.\")\n\n\nsolve_pll_sticker_puzzle()\n\n```\n<<<10>>>"
