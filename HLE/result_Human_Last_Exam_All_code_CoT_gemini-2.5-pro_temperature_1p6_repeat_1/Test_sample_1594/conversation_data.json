    "This is a geographical trivia question that can be solved by observing the satellite imagery of the specified location. Here is the plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  **Locate the Schools**: Find the \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" and \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\" in Pisa, Italy, using an online mapping service.\n2.  **Analyze Satellite View**: Switch to the satellite or aerial view to see the actual shape of the school buildings from directly above.\n3.  **Identify the Shape**: The combined footprint of the two adjacent school buildings clearly forms the shape of a capital letter. The main building structures consist of a long, primary section with two shorter wings extending perpendicularly in the same direction from the top and bottom.\n4.  **Determine the Letter**: This shape is identifiable as the letter 'F'.\n\nThe following Python code will print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_school_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reveals the answer to the Pisa high schools puzzle.\n\n    The question is: \"In Pisa there are multiple highschools.
