    This function reveals the answer to the Pisa high schools puzzle.

    The question is: "In Pisa there are multiple highschools. The two highscools of
    Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini, stand next to eachother.
    If seen from above their buildings form a letter, which one?"

    By examining the satellite view of these two adjacent schools on a map,
    one can see their combined building layout. The shape they form is
    a capital letter.

    # The prompt requests to "output each number in the final equation",
    # which is not applicable to this text-based answer.
    # Therefore, we will simply print the resulting letter.
