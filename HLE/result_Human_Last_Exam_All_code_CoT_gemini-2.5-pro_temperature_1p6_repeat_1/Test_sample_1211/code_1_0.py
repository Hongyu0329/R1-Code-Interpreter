    # Plan:
    # 1. Analyze each statement (I, II, III, IV, V) based on medical evidence regarding buprenorphine (Subutex) and buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone).
    # 2. Determine which statements are accurate and supported by evidence.
    # 3. Identify the answer choice that lists the combination of all the correct statements.
    # 4. Print the analysis and the final answer in the required format.

    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze each statement.

    print("Analysis of each statement:")

    # Statement I: "Suboxone could be seen as less safe than Subutex because it contains naloxone, which is included to deter misuse by injection. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal symptoms if the medication is injected, reducing the potential for abuse."
    # Verdict: Incorrect. The statement is self-contradictory. The second part describes a safety feature (deterring injection abuse) which makes it safer in that context, not "less safe".
    print("I: Incorrect. This statement is contradictory. The presence of naloxone is a safety feature to deter intravenous misuse, not something that makes it 'less safe'.")

    # Statement II: "Subutex could be seen as safer than Suboxone because it does not contain naloxone... In certain clinical situations, such as in pregnant women or individuals with a known sensitivity to naloxone, Subutex may be preferred to avoid these potential issues."
    # Verdict: Correct. This reflects valid clinical reasoning. Subutex (buprenorphine alone) is often the preferred formulation in specific populations like pregnant patients to avoid any potential, even if minor, effects of naloxone.
    print("II: Correct. It is a recognized clinical practice to prefer Subutex for specific populations (e.g., during pregnancy or for patients with naloxone sensitivity) to avoid any potential risks associated with naloxone.")

    # Statement III: "Suboxone could be seen as similarly safe to Subutex because both medications contain buprenorphine... The safety profile in terms of therapeutic use is similar when taken as prescribed."
    # Verdict: Correct. When taken sublingually as prescribed, the naloxone in Suboxone has very low bioavailability and does not have a significant clinical effect. The primary effects and risks for both drugs come from buprenorphine.
    print("III: Correct. When taken as prescribed (sublingually), the naloxone has minimal absorption and effect. The safety profile of both medications is primarily determined by the buprenorphine component, making them very similar in this context.")

    # Statement IV: "We know there are a few cases where we can make a statement about its safety, but largely we donâ€™t know if Suboxone is safer than Subutex..."
    # Verdict: Incorrect. The relative safety profiles and clinical indications for Subutex and Suboxone are well-established and understood in the medical community. The idea that "largely we don't know" is false.
    print("IV: Incorrect. The pharmacology and relative safety profiles of these medications are well-understood. This statement incorrectly suggests a high degree of uncertainty.")

    # Statement V: "The safety of Subutex versus Suboxone can be seen as dependent on the route of administration. Suboxone is designed to be safer in terms of reducing the risk of misuse when injected, due to the presence of naloxone, but when taken orally as prescribed, both medications have similar safety profiles."
    # Verdict: Correct. This provides an excellent summary of the key differences. The safety depends on the context of use. Suboxone is designed for greater safety against injection abuse, while their safety is comparable when used as directed.
    print("V: Correct. This statement accurately summarizes the context-dependent nature of their safety. Safety against misuse is higher with Suboxone, while therapeutic safety when taken as prescribed is similar for both.")

    # Step 3: Conclude which statements are correct.
    # The analysis supports statements II, III, and V.
    # The corresponding answer choice is Q.

    # Step 4: Print the result.
    print("\nConclusion: The correct statements are II, III, and V.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice Q.")

# This captures the output of the 'with' block
# and now we will print it as a single block of text.

# Final answer format
