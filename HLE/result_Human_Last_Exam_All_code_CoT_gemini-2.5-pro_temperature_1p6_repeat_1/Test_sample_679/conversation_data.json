    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the IUPAC name for the compound.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: Determine the degree of unsaturation from the molecular formula C7H14.\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**: Interpret each signal's chemical shift and multiplicity (s, d, t, q) to identify the types of carbon atoms present (C, CH, CH2, CH3) and identify key functional groups like alkenes.\n3.  **Reconcile Atom Count**: Compare the number of signals to the number of carbons in the formula to identify any chemically equivalent carbons (signal overlapping). Count the hydrogens based on multiplicities and confirm they match the molecular formula.\n4.  **Assemble Fragments**: Piece together the identified carbon fragments into a coherent molecular structure that fits all the data.\n5.  **Determine IUPAC Name**: Name the final structure according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\nThe code below will walk through this logic and print the final IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(\"The molecular formula is C7H14.\")\n    print(\"A saturated alkane with 7 carbons has the formula CnH(2n+2), which would be C7H16.\")\n    print(\"This compound has two fewer hydrogens, indicating one degree of unsaturation (one double bond or one ring).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(\"The 13C NMR data shows 6 signals for a 7-carbon molecule, which means two carbons are chemically equivalent.\")\n    print(\"The signals are: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\\n\")\n    print(\"Let's interpret each signal:\")\n    print(\"- Signal at 145 ppm (s): The chemical shift is in the alkene region.
