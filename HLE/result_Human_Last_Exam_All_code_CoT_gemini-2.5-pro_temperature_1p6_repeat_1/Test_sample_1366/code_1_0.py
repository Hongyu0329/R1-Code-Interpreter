    # Part (a) Analysis
    # The decomposition V(p) = sum_{n=0 to inf} rho_n (x) L(p)_n involves modules L(p)_n.
    # L(p)_n is the simple highest-weight module for L_k(sl_2) with top-level rho_n.
    # For the level k = -2 + 1/p, these modules are admissible representations.
    # The admissibility condition for the highest weight 'n' of rho_n is 0 <= n <= p-2.
    # This means the sum must be finite, not infinite.
    # Thus, the answer to the first question is "No".
    # A modified decomposition using a finite sum is plausible and such structures
    # exist in conformal field theory. So the answer to the second question is "Yes".

    # Part (b) Analysis
    # The question asks for the top-level dimension of L(p)_n.
    # By definition in the problem, the top-level of L(p)_n is the module rho_n.
    # Also by definition, rho_n is the (n+1)-dimensional irreducible sl_2-module.
    # Therefore, its dimension is n+1.

        # Simplifying yields the formula below.
        weight = p_val * n * (n + 2) / 4

    # The minimal conformal weight of this VOA corresponds to its vacuum state, which has weight h(0, 2) = 0.
    # The question asks for the minimal conformal weight, implying the smallest *positive* weight.
    # The VOA L_k(sl_2) is generated by currents of weight 1.
