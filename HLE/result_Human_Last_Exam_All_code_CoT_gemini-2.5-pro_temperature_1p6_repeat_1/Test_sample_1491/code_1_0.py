# Step 1: Determine the requirement for "Goal-driven locomotion triggered by visual stimuli."
# This is required for the Visual Cliff experiment where the subject crawls towards a goal.
# It is not required for the Swinging Room where the subject stands still.
answer_I = "cliff"

# Step 2: Determine the requirement for "A functional analogue of cortical area MST in humans."
# This is essential for the Swinging Room experiment, which relies on processing large-field optic flow to create the illusion of self-motion.
# It is not the primary mechanism for the Visual Cliff experiment.
answer_II = "room"

# Step 3: Determine the requirement for "A perceptual mechanism for evaluating the relative size of elements in the visual scene."
# This depth cue is critical for the Visual Cliff experiment, where the pattern on the deep side appears smaller.
# It is not relevant to the Swinging Room experiment.
answer_III = "cliff"

# Step 4: Determine the requirement for "A mechanism for resolving binocular disparity."
# This binocular depth cue is another critical component for perceiving depth in the Visual Cliff experiment.
# It is not required for the Swinging Room experiment, which works with monocular vision.
answer_IV = "cliff"

# Step 5: Determine the requirement for "A mechanism for controlling the effectors that maintain posture."
# This is required for the Visual Cliff (to enable crawling) and is the central measured response in the Swinging Room (to maintain balance).
answer_V = "both"

# Final Step: Combine the answers in order, separated by hyphens.
