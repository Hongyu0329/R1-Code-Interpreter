    # Step 1: Define the function to compute.
    # The function is the squared norm: f(x) = ||x||^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_N^2.
    # This function is an even function, meaning f(x) = f(-x).

    # Step 2: Use the property of the GeLU activation function.
    # The Taylor series of GeLU(z) around z=0 is g(z) ≈ 0.5*z + C2*z^2 + O(z^4),
    # where C2 = 1/sqrt(2*pi).
    # To approximate an even function like x^2, we should construct an even network.
    # We can create an even building block by pairing neurons:
    # h(z) = GeLU(z) + GeLU(-z).
    # The odd terms in the Taylor series cancel out, leaving:
    # h(z) ≈ 2*C2*z^2 + O(z^4).
    # This symmetric pair of neurons can approximate the square function.

    # Step 3: Propose a construction for ||x||^2.
    # To compute Σ(x_j^2), we can dedicate a pair of neurons to each dimension x_j.
    # For each j in {1, ..., N}, we use one pair to approximate x_j^2.
    # This requires N pairs of neurons.
    # Total number of neurons = N pairs * 2 neurons/pair = 2*N.
    # This shows that a width of 2N is sufficient.

    # Step 4: Argue for the minimality (lower bound) using a rank argument.
    # A shallow network's output (approximating quadratic terms) is of the form:
    # y(x) ≈ x^T * M * x, where M is a matrix formed by the network weights.
    # To compute ||x||^2 = x^T * I * x, we need M to be the identity matrix I (of rank N).
    # The matrix M is constructed from the sum of K rank-1 matrices, where K is the number
    # of symmetric building blocks. The rank of M is at most K.
    # To get a rank-N matrix, we need at least N such blocks (K >= N).
    # If each block is constructed from a pair of neurons, the total width H = 2*K.
    # Therefore, H must be at least 2*N.

    # Step 5: Combine the sufficiency and necessity arguments.
    # We need H >= 2N, and we have shown that H = 2N is sufficient.
    # Therefore, the minimum width is 2N.
