    "My plan is to identify the main projection target of ASJ axons by querying the comprehensive *C. elegans* connectome database available at wormwiring.org.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n1.  **Query the Database**: I will write a script to send an API request to the wormwiring.org database. This query will retrieve all synaptic connections that originate from the ASJ neurons (both ASJL and ASJR).\n2.  **Process the Data**: The script will then process the returned data. Since neurons often come in left/right pairs (e.g., RIAL/RIAR), I will group them by their cell type (e.g., RIA) to get a complete picture of the projection targets.\n3.  **Aggregate Synapses**: For each target cell type, I will sum the total number of synapses received from both ASJL and ASJR.\n4.  **Identify Main Target**: I will identify the cell type with the highest total synapse count.\n5.  **Display Results**: The script will print the name of the main target cell, a detailed breakdown of the synapses from ASJL and ASJR, and the final equation showing the total calculation.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\n\ndef find_asj_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Queries the wormwiring.org connectome to find the main synaptic target \n    cell type of ASJ neurons based on synapse number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the API endpoint and the Cypher query.\n    api_url = \"https://wormwiring.org/db/api/query\"\n    # This query retrieves all presynaptic connections from ASJ neurons.\n    cypher_query = {\n        \"cypher\": \"MATCH (n1:Neuron)-[r:Synapse]->(n2:Neuron) WHERE n1.name IN ['ASJL', 'ASJR'] RETURN n1.name AS Presynaptic, n2.name AS Postsynaptic, r.N AS Synapses\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Querying the C. elegans connectome database (wormwiring.org)...\")\n\n    try:\n        # Step 2: Make the POST request to the API.\n        response = requests.post(api_url, json=cypher_query)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not retrieve data from the API. {e}\")\n        return\n\n    try:\n        data = response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError:\n        print(\"Error: Could not decode JSON from the API response.\")\n        return\n\n    if 'data' not in data or not data['data']:\n        print(\"Query returned no data.
