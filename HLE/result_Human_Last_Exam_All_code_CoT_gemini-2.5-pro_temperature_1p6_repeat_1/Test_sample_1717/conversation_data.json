    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will identify the formula used by Terraria to calculate boss health in Expert Mode. This formula depends on the boss's base health, the Expert Mode multiplier, and the number of players.\n2.  I will find the specific values for the Eye of Cthulhu: its base health, its Expert Mode health multiplier, and the health bonus added for each player.\n3.  Next, I will analyze what happens to this formula as the number of players approaches infinity. This will show that the health value increases without a mathematical limit.\n4.  Finally, I will consider the technical limitations of the game engine. The maximum health of any entity in Terraria is constrained by the maximum value of the data type used to store it, which is a 32-bit signed integer. This technical limit represents the true theoretical maximum health.\n5.  The Python code will present this logic, showing the formula and explaining why the final answer is the integer limit, and then print the final value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_terraria_health_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health = 2800  # Normal Mode health\n    expert_mode_multiplier = 1.3\n    per_player_bonus = 0.35  # 35% bonus health per player after the first\n\n    # Step 2: Display the health calculation formula.\n    print(\"The formula for boss health in Expert Mode is:\")\n    print(\"Health = Base_Health * Expert_Multiplier * (1 + Per_Player_Bonus * (Number_of_Players - 1))\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the Eye of Cthulhu, the equation with its specific values is:\")\n    # The requirement is to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will represent the equation with its numerical values.\n    # For clarity, let's also show the initial single-player expert health.\n    single_player_expert_health = int(base_health * expert_mode_multiplier)\n    print(f\"Health(N) = {base_health} * {expert_mode_multiplier} * (1 + {per_player_bonus} * (N - 1))\")\n    print(f\"Health(N) = {single_player_expert_health} * (1 + {per_player_bonus} * (N - 1))\")\n\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the consequence of infinite players.\n    print(\"\\nAs the number of players (N) approaches infinity, this health value increases linearly and also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"However, there is a technical limitation within the game's source code.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the technical limitation and find the max value.\n    print(\"\\nTerraria stores NPC health as a 32-bit signed integer.\")\n    print(\"A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value of 2^31 - 1.\")\n\n    max_health_limit = 2**31 - 1\n\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can have is capped by this data type limit.\")\n    print(f\"The final answer is: {max_health_limit:,}\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health_limit()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
