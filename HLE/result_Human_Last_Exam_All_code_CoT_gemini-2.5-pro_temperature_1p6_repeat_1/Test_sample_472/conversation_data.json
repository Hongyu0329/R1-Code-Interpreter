    "My plan is to scan the provided line of Latin poetry, \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male,\" according to the rules of Latin prosody. This line, from Terence's *Andria*, is written in the Iambic Senarius meter.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the scansion:\n1.  **Identify the Meter:** The line is an Iambic Senarius, which consists of six iambic feet (`S L`, where `S` is a short syllable and `L` is a long one). Various substitutions (like a spondee `L L`, an anapest `S S L`, or a trochee `L S`) are permitted, especially in the odd-numbered feet.\n2.  **Account for Elision:** The word `bene` ends in `-e`, and the next word `esse` begins with an `e`. This results in an elision where the final vowel of `bene` is dropped, and we scan `ben'esse`.\n3.  **Determine Syllable Length:** I will determine the length of each syllable based on whether it is \"long by nature\" (contains a long vowel or diphthong) or \"long by position\" (a short vowel followed by two or more consonants). A syllable is short otherwise.\n    *   `et`: Long by position (followed by `t` and the `t` of `tibi`).\n    *   `ti-bi`: Both syllables are short.\n    *   `ben'esse`: The elided form becomes `be-nes-se`. `be` is short. `nes` is long by position (`ss`). `se` is short.\n    *   `so-li`: Scans as `sō-lī` (dative of `solus`). Both syllables are long by nature.\n    *   `quom`: Long by position (the final `m` is followed by the `s` of `sibi`).\n    *   `si-bi`: Both syllables are short.\n    *   `sit`: Long by position (followed by `t` and the `m` of `male`).\n    *   `ma-le`: Both syllables are naturally short.\n4.  **Group into Feet:** I will group the resulting sequence of long and short syllables into six metrical feet, applying the allowed substitutions for the Iambic Senarius meter.\n    *   **Foot 1:** `et ti` -> `L S` (Trochee)\n    *   **Foot 2:** `bi be n'es` -> `S S L` (Anapest)\n    *   **Foot 3:** `se so` -> `S L` (Iamb)\n    *   **Foot 4:** `li quom` -> `L L` (Spondee)\n    *   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` -> `S S L` (Anapest)\n    *   **Foot 6:** `ma le` -> `S S`. This is a pyrrhic, but in the final position, it's treated as an iamb (`S L`) by the principle of *brevis in longo*.\n\n5.  **Construct Final Code:** The Python code will assemble this analysis into the final scansion string and print it.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the Latin line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the metrical feet based on analysis of the Iambic Senarius line.\n    # L = Long, S = Short.\n    # Feet are determined by meter, elision, vowel quantities, and position.\n    feet = [\n        \"LS\",    # Foot 1: et ti (Trochee)\n        \"SSL\",   # Foot 2: bi be n'esse (Anapest, with elision)\n        \"SL\",    # Foot 3: se so- (Iamb)\n        \"LL\",    # Foot 4: -li quom (Spondee)\n        \"SSL\",   # Foot 5: si bi sit (Anapest)\n        \"SL\"     # Foot 6: ma le (Iamb, via brevis in longo)\n    ]\n\n    # Join the feet with spaces to create the final scansion string.\n    # This represents the \"equation\" of the scansion.\n    final_scansion = \" \".join(feet)\n\n    # Print each part of the final \"equation\" (the scansion string).\n    print(final_scansion)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
