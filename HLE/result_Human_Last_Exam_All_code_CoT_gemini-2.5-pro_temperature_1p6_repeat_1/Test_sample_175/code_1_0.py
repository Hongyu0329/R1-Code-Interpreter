    # D. Salience: Makes the AI suggestion more prominent, encouraging users to rely on it as a shortcut. INCREASES bias.
    # E. Justification: Forces users to engage in the detailed reasoning the bias seeks to avoid. REDUCES bias.

    explanation = """
The core of automation bias is the tendency to take a mental shortcut and over-rely on an AI's suggestion. Therefore, to reduce this bias, measures should encourage deeper, critical thinking.

- Options A (Accountability) and E (Justification) both force the teacher to engage mentally with the decision and take ownership, which directly counteracts the bias.
- Option B (Confidence Levels) provides crucial context, allowing the teacher to better gauge when a suggestion needs more scrutiny.
- Option C (Regular Practice) helps teachers calibrate their trust in the AI, learning its strengths and weaknesses, thus preventing over-reliance.

- Option D (Making the AI advice more salient), however, does the opposite. Salience means making something more prominent or noticeable. By making the AI's suggestion stand out more, the interface design actively encourages the teacher to focus on and accept it, reinforcing it as a mental shortcut. This would likely increase, not decrease, automation bias.
