    Solves the problem by reasoning about the properties of the conditioned Brownian motion.
    
    The problem asks for the limit of a probability P[V_n > 2/3] related to a conditioned Brownian motion.
    V_n is the relative area of a disk B_n covered by a "sausage" from the Brownian path.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the process X_t.
    # The process X_t is a standard complex Brownian motion conditioned to never hit the unit disk D_0.
    # The conditioning is a Doob's h-transform with h(z) = ln|z|.
    # This introduces a drift term to the Brownian motion, making it transient.
    # This means that |X_t| -> infinity as t -> infinity, almost surely. A transient process
    # does not return to any finite region once it has traveled far away.
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the quantity V_n.
    # V_n measures the density of the sausage (the path X_[0,inf) thickened by a radius of 1)
    # inside a disk B_n = {z: |z-n| <= n/3}.
    # As n -> infinity, the disk B_n becomes very large and is located very far from the origin.
    # By an ergodic-type argument, the random variable V_n converges in probability to a
    # non-random constant, rho, which is the asymptotic density of the sausage.
    # V_n --> rho (in probability) as n -> infinity.

    # Step 3: Determine the sausage density rho.
    # The density rho can be defined as rho = lim_{|A|->inf} |S_X intersect A| / |A|,
    # where S_X is the sausage generated by X_t.
    # This density is equivalent to the probability that a generic point z is covered by the sausage.
    # P(z is covered) = P(inf_t |X_t - z| <= 1) = P(the path X_t hits the disk D(z, 1)).
    #
    # Since the process X_t is transient, its path goes to infinity. The probability that this path,
    # starting from a fixed point X_0, will intersect a small target disk D(z, 1) far away tends
    # to zero as the distance |z| of the target goes to infinity.
    # Therefore, the asymptotic density of the sausage is 0.
    rho = 0

    # Step 4: Calculate the final limit.
    # We have established that V_n converges to 0 in probability.
    # We want to find lim_{n->inf} P[V_n > 2/3].
    # Since V_n approaches 0, the probability that V_n is greater than a positive constant
    # must go to 0.
    # Formally, for any epsilon > 0, lim_{n->inf} P(|V_n - 0| >= epsilon) = 0.
    # Let's consider the specific numbers in the problem.
    comparison_value = 2/3
    
    # The event {V_n > 2/3} is a subset of {|V_n| >= 2/3} (since V_n is non-negative).
    # So, lim_{n->inf} P(V_n > 2/3) <= lim_{n->inf} P(|V_n| >= 2/3) = 0.
    # Since probability is always non-negative, the limit must be 0.
    
    final_limit = 0

    # Output the final equation and the numbers involved.
    print(f"The problem is to find the limit of P[V_n > c] as n -> infinity.")
    print(f"The value of c is 2/3, which is {comparison_value}.")
    print(f"Based on the analysis, the sausage density rho is {rho}.")
    print(f"Therefore, V_n converges to {rho} in probability.")
    print(f"The final equation is: lim_{{n->inf}} P[V_n > {2}/{3}] = {final_limit}")
