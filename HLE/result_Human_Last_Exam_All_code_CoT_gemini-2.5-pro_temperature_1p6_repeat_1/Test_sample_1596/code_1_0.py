def solve_quaternion_rope():
    """
    Analyzes the statements about Quaternion RoPE and prints the sorted list of correct letters.
    
    A) False. Depends on n-m, not |m-n|.
    B) False. Fails due to non-commutativity in general.
    C) True. The axis is fixed by definition for the composition property to hold.
    D) False. The scheme encodes 1D positions.
    E) True. |R_m|=1, so the norm is preserved.
    F) True. Real scalars commute with quaternions.
    G) True. The rotation is an isometry in R^4, preserving inner products.
    H) True. Rotations with the same axis compose by adding angles.
    J) True. R_m and R_n commute, so the difference is 0, which is purely imaginary.
    K) False. The real part gets mixed with vector parts.
    L) True. Trace of the left-multiplication matrix for q=a+... is 4a.
    M) False. The commutator is always 0 for any fixed axis.
    N) False. The magnitude is always 1 for a unit vector, so the limit is 1.
