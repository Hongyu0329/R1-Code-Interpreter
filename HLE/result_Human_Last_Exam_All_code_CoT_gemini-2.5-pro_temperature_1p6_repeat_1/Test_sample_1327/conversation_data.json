    "To find the next number in the sequence, we need to identify the pattern governing the relationship between consecutive terms.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  Let's examine the relationship between each number and the one preceding it. We'll try a formula of the form `next_term = 3 * previous_term - k`.\n2.  The first term is 2, the second is 11. `3 * 2 = 6`. `11 = 6 + 5`.\n3.  The second term is 11, the third is 23. `3 * 11 = 33`. `23 = 33 - 10`.\n4.  The third term is 23, the fourth is 51. `3 * 23 = 69`. `51 = 69 - 18`.\n5.  The fourth term is 51, the fifth is 119. `3 * 51 = 153`. `119 = 153 - 34`.\n\nWe observe a consistent pattern starting from the third term:\n*   `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`\n*   `51 = 3 * 23 - 18`\n*   `119 = 3 * 51 - 34`\n\nLet's analyze the sequence of numbers being subtracted: 10, 18, 34.\n*   The difference between 18 and 10 is 8.\n*   The difference between 34 and 18 is 16.\n\nThe differences are 8 and 16, which are powers of 2 (`2^3`, `2^4`). The difference is doubling each time. The next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n\nTherefore, the next number to be subtracted will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the next term in the main sequence:\n*   `Next term = 3 * 119 - 66`\n*   `Next term = 357 - 66`\n*   `Next term = 291`\n\nThe following Python code calculates this final step.\n\n```python\n# The given sequence\nsequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n# The last known number in the sequence\nlast_number = sequence[-1]\n\n# The sequence of subtracted values is 10, 18, 34.\n# The differences between these values are 8 (18-10) and 16 (34-18).\n# The next difference is 16 * 2 = 32.\n# So, the next value to subtract is 34 + 32 = 66.\nk = 66\n\n# The pattern is: next_number = 3 * previous_number - k\nmultiplier = 3\nnext_number = multiplier * last_number - k\n\n# Output the equation and the result\nprint(f\"The pattern is next_number = 3 * previous_number - k.\")\nprint(f\"The next k is calculated as 34 + (16 * 2) = {k}\")\nprint(f\"So, the equation is: {multiplier} * {last_number} - {k} = {next_number}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
