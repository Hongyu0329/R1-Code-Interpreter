    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial**: We'll start by factoring the given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ into its irreducible factors over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Determine Galois Groups**: For each irreducible factor, we will determine the Galois group of its splitting field over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  **Find the Galois Group of the Compositum**: The splitting field $K$ of the original polynomial is the compositum (the smallest field containing both) of the splitting fields of its factors. We will determine the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ and its order. The order $|G|$ is the degree of the extension $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n4.  **Identify Normal Subgroups**: According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset L \\subset K$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ where $\\{e\\} \\neq H \\neq G$. We will identify all such subgroups by analyzing the structure of $G$.\n5.  **Calculate Degrees**: For each proper, non-trivial normal subgroup $H$, we will calculate the degree of the corresponding normal subfield $L$ using the formula $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G:H| = |G|/|H|$. These are the possible degrees we are looking for.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_degrees_of_normal_extensions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the possible degrees of normal field extensions L/Q\n    for the splitting field K of the polynomial x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6,\n    such that Q < L < K.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variable and the polynomial\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = x**7 - 2*x**5 - 9*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 18*x - 6\n\n    # Step 1: Factor the polynomial over Q\n    print(\"Step 1: Factoring the polynomial.\")\n    factors = sympy.factor(f, domain='Q')\n    print(f\"The polynomial f(x) factors over Q as: {factors}\\n\")\n    \n    # Extract the two factors\n    # The order of factors can vary, so we ensure g is degree 2 and h is degree 5\n    if sympy.degree(factors.args[0]) == 2:\n        g_poly = factors.args[0]\n        h_poly = factors.args[1]\n    else:\n        g_poly = factors.args[1]\n        h_poly = factors.args[0]\n\n    print(f\"The factors are g(x) = {g_poly} and h(x) = {h_poly}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the Galois groups of the factors\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the Galois group of each factor.\")\n    # For g(x) = x^2 - 2\n    # The splitting field of x^2 - 2 is Q(sqrt(2)).\n    # This is a degree 2 extension, and its Galois group is C_2 (cyclic group of order 2).\n    galois_g_order = 2\n    print(f\"The Galois group of g(x) is the cyclic group C_2, which has order {galois_g_order}.\")\n\n    # For h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3\n    # 1.
