    print("Step 1: Deconstruct the word.")
    print("- The word 'quemquamne' is composed of 'quemquam' + the enclitic '-ne'.")
    print("- 'quemquam' is the accusative singular form of the pronoun 'quisquam' (anyone).")
    print("- '-ne' is a particle that turns the clause into a question.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure
    print("Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure.")
    print("- The sentence starts with 'vah', an interjection expressing astonishment or indignation.")
    print("- The phrase 'quemquamne hominem' ('any man?') is in the accusative case.")
    print("- The main verbal elements are 'instituere' (to establish) and 'parare' (to prepare), which are both infinitives.")

    print("- It is not an indirect statement, as there is no verb of saying, thinking, or perceiving.")
    print("- Instead, it is used to express a strong emotion, like shock, protest, or disbelief. The accusative phrase acts as the subject of the infinitive in an exclamatory context.")
    print("A literal translation would be something like: 'Oh! That any man should establish or prepare in his mind anything dearer than he is to himself!'\n")
