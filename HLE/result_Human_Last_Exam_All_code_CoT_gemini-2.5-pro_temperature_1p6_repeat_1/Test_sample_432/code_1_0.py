# Based on the analysis of cardinalities for each set:
# The sets with cardinality c, the same as [0, 1], are:
# A, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O.
# The code below will sort these letters and print the result as a single string.

correct_options = ['A', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'M', 'N', 'O']

# Sort the list alphabetically (it is already sorted, but this ensures correctness)
correct_options.sort()

# Join the list elements into a single string
final_answer = "".join(correct_options)

# Print the final answer string
print(final_answer)
