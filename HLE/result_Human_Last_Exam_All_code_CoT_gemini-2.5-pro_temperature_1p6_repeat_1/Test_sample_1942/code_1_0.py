# The user wants to know which of Peter Sloterdijk's "anthropospheres"
# serves as a metaphor for the State.

# In his monumental "Spheres" trilogy, Sloterdijk describes three primary forms
# of human spatial existence or "anthropospheres":
# 1. Bubbles: The initial, intimate, dyadic micro-spheres (e.g., the mother-fetus relationship).
# 2. Globes: The classical macro-spheres that attempt to represent a single, all-encompassing whole (e.g., the cosmos of the ancient Greeks, the orb of the Christian god, globalization, and the nation-state).
# 3. Foam: The modern condition where individuals live in co-isolated cells or apartments, connected yet separate.

# The State, as a political entity that aims to be a self-contained, sovereign, and totalizing world for its citizens,
# is a primary example of the second anthroposphere.
answer = "Globes"
