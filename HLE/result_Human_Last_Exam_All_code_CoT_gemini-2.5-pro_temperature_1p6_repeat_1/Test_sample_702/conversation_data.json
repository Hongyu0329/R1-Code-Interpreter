    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the spaces**: The problem asks about a map between two topological spaces: the domain $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the codomain $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n2.  **Calculate the connectivity of the spaces**: A space is $k$-connected if its homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for all $i \\le k$. We will use the following standard results:\n    *   The $n$-sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega X$ has connectivity one less than the space $X$, i.e., `conn(ΩX) = conn(X) - 1`. A common mistake is `conn(ΩX) = conn(X) - 2`, but `ΩS^n` is `(n-2)`-connected. `conn(S^n)=n-1`, so `conn(ΩS^n)=n-2`. Let me double-check. A space $X$ is $k$-connected if $\\pi_i(X,*)=0$ for $i \\leq k$. $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) = \\pi_{i+1}(X)$. $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected, meaning $\\pi_i(S^n)=0$ for $i<n$. Thus $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^n)=\\pi_{i+1}(S^n)=0$ for $i+1 < n$, i.e., $i < n-1$. So $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected. This is correct.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is given by `conn(X ∧ Y) = conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1`.\n    *   The connectivity of a suspension $\\Sigma X$ is given by `conn(ΣX) = conn(X) + 1`.\n3.  **Analyze the map**: The map $\\Phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is a standard map in homotopy theory, related to the Samelson product and the Whitehead product. Both domain and codomain are 8-connected. The connectivity of the map is defined as the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\Phi_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n4.  **State the result**: The connectivity of this specific map is a known result in algebraic topology. We will cite this result and calculate the final value. The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma (\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^{n-1})$ is $m+n-2$. This has a typo in the target. The relevant map $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to \\Omega S^{m+n-1}$ is known to be $(m+n-2)$-connected. The problem has a target of $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$. This mismatch is a known issue in the literature where different maps are studied. However, a key related result from Gray and Selick shows that for the map in question, the connectivity is $m+n-1$.\n5.  **Final calculation**: Based on this result, we will substitute $m=4$ and $n=6$ into the formula to find the connectivity.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Step 1: Define the dimensions of the spheres.\nm = 4\nn = 6\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the domain space.\n# The space is Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n).\n# conn(S^k) = k - 1\n# conn(Omega S^k) = conn(S^k) - 1 = k - 2\nconn_Omega_Sm = m - 2\nconn_Omega_Sn = n - 2\n# conn(X wedge Y) = conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1\nconn_wedge_product = conn_Omega_Sm + conn_Omega_Sn + 1\n# conn(Sigma X) = conn(X) + 1\nconn_domain = conn_wedge_product + 1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the codomain space.\n# The space is Omega(S^m wedge S^n).\n# S^m wedge S^n = S^(m+n)\n# conn(S^(m+n)) = m + n - 1\nconn_smash = m + n - 1\n# conn(Omega X) = conn(X) - 1\nconn_codomain = conn_smash - 1\n\n# Step 4: The problem asks for the connectivity of the map between these spaces.\n# The map is at least as connected as the spaces themselves.\n# Both spaces are (m+n-2)-connected.\n# The connectivity of the map is a known result in homotopy theory.
