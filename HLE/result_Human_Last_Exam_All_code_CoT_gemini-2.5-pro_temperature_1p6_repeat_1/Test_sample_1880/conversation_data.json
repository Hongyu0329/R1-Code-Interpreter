    "To find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for determining the Galois group of a quartic polynomial over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** Determine if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We will use Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial. The sign of the discriminant and whether it's a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ tells us if the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** Form the resolvent cubic polynomial. Whether this cubic is reducible or irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ further narrows down the possibilities for the Galois group.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Combine the information from the previous steps to identify the specific Galois group and its order.\n\nThe following Python script will execute these steps and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # This is a depressed quartic of the form x^4 + px + q.\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n\n    print(\"Computing the order of the Galois group for the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q\n    print(\"Step 1: Check if the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p = 2:\")\n    print(\"1.
