    "In the path integral formalism for fermions, the properties of particles are described using special anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables. The Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, is encoded directly into the algebraic properties of these variables. Specifically, for any Grassmann variable `η`, its square is zero: `η² = 0`.\n\nThe \"measure\" for an integral over a Grassmann variable, `dη`, is not a simple number but is instead defined by the rules of integration it follows. These rules, collectively known as Berezin integration, are defined to be consistent with the `η² = 0` property. The value of an integral over a Grassmann variable is determined by these fundamental rules. The following script will print these defining rules and their values.\n\n```python\ndef explain_grassmann_integral_measure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and prints the fundamental rules for Grassmann integration,\n    which define the integral measure and enforce the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In fermionic path integrals, the Pauli exclusion principle is captured by\n    # the property that Grassmann variables (eta) square to zero: eta^2 = 0.\n    # The integration measure d_eta is defined by its results when integrating\n    # the possible functions of eta.
