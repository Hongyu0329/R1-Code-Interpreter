    "This is a question that requires applying several results from the theory of finite groups. Here is my step-by-step plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the definitions**: I will first break down the terms in the question: \"finite group\", \"product-free set\", \"maximum by inclusion product-free set\", \"filled group\", and \"nilpotent group\".\n2.  **State the core theorem for filled groups**: The characterization of filled groups is key. A finite group G is filled if and only if it does not have a quotient group (G/N for some normal subgroup N) that is a \"minimal non-abelian group\". Since we are dealing with nilpotent groups, this condition simplifies.\n3.  **Apply the nilpotent condition**: Finite nilpotent groups are direct products of their Sylow p-subgroups. This property allows us to break down the problem from a general nilpotent group to its p-group components. A nilpotent group is filled if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups is filled.\n4.  **Analyze filled p-groups**: The problem now reduces to identifying which finite p-groups are filled. A p-group P is filled if and only if it does not have a minimal non-abelian p-group as a quotient.\n5.  **Use Rédei's Theorem**: A crucial theorem by László Rédei states that every non-abelian p-group *does* have a minimal non-abelian quotient.\n6.  **Synthesize the conclusion**: Based on Rédei's theorem, any non-abelian p-group is not filled. This means that for a p-group to be filled, it must be abelian.\n7.  **Final characterization**: Since a nilpotent group is filled if and only if all its Sylow p-subgroups are filled, and filled p-groups must be abelian, it follows that a nilpotent group is filled if and only if all its Sylow p-subgroups are abelian. A finite group whose Sylow p-subgroups are all abelian is, in fact, abelian itself.\n8.  **Provide a Python script**: To make this result concrete, I will provide a Python script that, for any given order `n`, lists the structures of all finite filled nilpotent groups (i.e., all abelian groups) of that order. This fulfills the request to use coding skills and output the answer programmatically.\n\nThe final answer is that **the finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the finite abelian groups**. The following code demonstrates how to enumerate these groups for a specific order.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = defaultdict(int)\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] += 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] += 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_partitions(k):\n    \"\"\"Generates all integer partitions of k.\"\"\"\n    if k == 0:\n        yield []\n        return\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        for p in get_partitions(k - i):\n            if not p or i >= p[0]:\n                yield [i] + p\n\ndef get_abelian_group_structures(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all non-isomorphic abelian groups of order n.\n    This represents all finite filled nilpotent groups of order n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return [\"{e}\"]\n\n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    \n    # This list will hold lists of p-group structures for each prime factor\n    # e.g., [[C_4, C_2xC_2], [C_3]] for n=12\n    all_p_group_options = []\n\n    sorted_primes = sorted(prime_factors.keys())\n\n    for p in sorted_primes:\n        a = prime_factors[p]\n        partitions = get_partitions(a)\n        \n        p_group_structures = []\n        for part in partitions:\n            # A partition like [2, 1, 1] for p^4 means C_{p^2} x C_{p^1} x C_{p^1}\n            components = [f\"C_{p**val}\" for val in reversed(part)]\n            p_group_structures.append(\" x \".join(components))\n        all_p_group_options.append(p_group_structures)\n        \n    # Generate all combinations of p-group structures\n    final_group_structures = []\n    for combo in product(*all_p_group_options):\n        final_group_structures.append(\" x \".join(combo))\n        \n    return final_group_structures\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # The classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is that they are precisely the finite abelian groups.\n    # This script will list all such groups for a user-specified order n.\n    \n    try:\n        n_str = input(\"Enter a positive integer order n: \")\n        n = int(n_str)\n        if n <= 0:\n            raise ValueError\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\n        print(\"Invalid input.
