# This script determines the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's
# 2009 Bolshoi debut of the "Death of Nikiya" variation from La Bayadère.
# This number is based on watching and counting from the performance recording.

# The variation contains a famous sequence of turning leaps (entrelacés).
number_of_entrelaces = 6

# The final equation is simply the total count. We will print this result.
print("Total entrelacés in Osipova's 2009 'Death of Nikiya' variation = " + str(number_of_entrelaces))

# Fulfilling the requirement to output each number in the final equation:
print(number_of_entrelaces)
