def analyze_superlubricity_factors():
    """
    Analyzes and models the factors controlling friction in superlubric systems.

    This function explains why option C is the most accurate description and
    provides a simplified model to demonstrate the principle. In many superlubric
    systems, the frictional force is not constant but depends dynamically on
    velocity and temperature. This is due to thermally activated "slips" and
    the potential for synchronized fluctuations between the sliding surfaces,
    which can break the superlubric state and increase energy dissipation (friction).
