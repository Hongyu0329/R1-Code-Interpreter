# The problem presents a paradox:
# 1. A "tame functor" in representation theory generally has infinite projective dimension.
# 2. A functor constructed via an exact functor from the representation category of a finite poset must have finite projective dimension.

# This contradiction for any non-zero functor implies that the only possible subject of the question
# is the zero functor, F = 0.

# The projective dimension of the zero functor is 0.
# Thus, if "n-resolvable" refers to the projective dimension, n must be 0.

# The final equation solving for n is:
final_equation = "n = 0"
print("The analysis of the problem's contradictory premises leads to the conclusion that F must be the zero functor.")
print("The projective dimension of the zero functor is 0. Therefore, n = 0.")
print("\nThe final equation is:")
print(final_equation)

# As per the instruction to output each number in the final equation,
# we extract the number from our conclusion.
n_value = 0
print("\nThe number in this equation is:")
print(n_value)
