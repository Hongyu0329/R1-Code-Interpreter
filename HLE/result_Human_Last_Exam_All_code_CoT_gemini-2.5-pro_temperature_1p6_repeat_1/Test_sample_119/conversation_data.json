    "My plan is to identify the shortest checkmating sequence for Black from the given chess position.\n\n1.  **Establish the Board Position**: I will first process the given PGN (Portable Game Notation) move history to set up the current state of the chessboard. I will use the `python-chess` library to parse the moves and arrive at the final position.\n2.  **Analyze the Position for a Mate**: With the board set up, I will analyze the position to find the shortest possible checkmate for Black. The White King is very exposed on g5, suggesting a quick mate is likely. I'll look for forced sequences starting with checks.\n3.  **Identify the Mating Sequence**: My analysis shows a mate in two moves. The sequence begins with a pawn check, which forces the White King into a mating net. I will detail one of these mating lines.\n4.  **Format the Output**: Finally, I will write a Python script to print the identified sequence of moves in the requested format (Standard Algebraic Notation, without move numbers).\n\nHere is the Python code to display the solution:\n\n```python\nimport chess\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function sets up the chess board from the given PGN,\n    verifies the final position, and prints the shortest mating sequence for Black.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The PGN moves provided in the problem description.\n    pgn_moves_str = (\n        \"1. e4 c6 2. c4 e6 3.
