# The task is to identify a specific playing card from a movie scene.
# A script cannot "watch" a movie, so this problem is solved by retrieving the information
# and presenting it in the requested script format.

# The first card Jesse Eisenberg's character, J. Daniel Atlas, shows to the camera
# during the opening street magic scene is the Seven of Diamonds.

rank = "Seven"
suit = "Diamonds"

# Construct the full name of the card.
card_name = f"{rank} of {suit}"

# Print the final answer.
print(card_name)
