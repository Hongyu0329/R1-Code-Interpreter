    "To determine the number of let-7 family members in humans, I will first compile a list of these members based on information from the primary microRNA database, miRBase. The let-7 family includes several microRNAs, typically designated with a letter suffix (e.g., let-7a, let-7b), and also includes miR-98, which shares the same seed sequence.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Create a Python list containing the names of the distinct mature human let-7 family members.\n2.  Use the `len()` function to count the number of items in the list.\n3.  Print out each member of the family.\n4.  Finally, print the total count in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\n# The let-7 family is a group of microRNAs that are highly conserved across species.\n# In humans, this family is composed of several members which share a similar seed sequence.\n# The primary members are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n# Some members, like let-7a and let-7f, are encoded by multiple genes but produce identical mature microRNAs.\n# This script lists the unique mature members and calculates the total number.\n\nlet7_family_members = [\n    \"let-7a\",\n    \"let-7b\",\n    \"let-7c\",\n    \"let-7d\",\n    \"let-7e\",\n    \"let-7f\",\n    \"let-7g\",\n    \"let-7i\",\n    \"miR-98\"\n]\n\n# Calculate the total number of members\nnum_members = len(let7_family_members)\n\n# Print the members\nprint(\"The members of the let-7 family in humans are:\")\nfor member in let7_family_members:\n    print(f\"- {member}\")\n\n# Print the final count\nprint(f\"\\nTo date, {num_members} members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\")\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
