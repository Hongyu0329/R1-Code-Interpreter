    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  The problem asks for the number of ordered 5-tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. A brute-force search over all possible values for the five variables would be computationally expensive.\n2.  A more efficient approach is to first find the unique sets of five numbers `{x1, x2, x3, x4, x5}` whose squares sum to 2024, without considering their order. To avoid duplicates, I'll search for solutions where the numbers are in a non-increasing order, i.e., $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$.\n3.  I will implement a recursive backtracking search to find these sets. The search will be heavily optimized with pruning techniques. For example, if we are looking for `k` numbers to sum to a `target`, and the current largest number we can pick is `x`, then `k * x^2` must be at least `target`, otherwise, no solution can be found in this branch.\n4.  Once a unique set of five numbers is found, say `S = {a, b, c, d, e}`, the next step is to calculate how many distinct ordered solutions (permutations) can be formed from this set. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the multinomial coefficient formula: $5! / (n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot ...)$, where $n_i$ is the number of times each distinct value appears in the set `S`.\n5.  I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Finds all these unique, non-increasing solution sets.\n    *   For each set found, it will print the equation using the numbers in that set, and calculate the number of distinct permutations.\n    *   Finally, it will sum up the number of permutations for all sets to get the total number of solutions and print this final count.\n\nThis approach breaks the problem down into manageable parts and provides a clear and verifiable path to the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Global list to store the found solution sets (in non-increasing order)\nsolution_sets = []\n\ndef find_solution_sets(target, k, path, max_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively finds all non-increasing sequences of k non-negative integers\n    whose squares sum to 'target'.\n\n    Args:\n        target: The remaining sum to achieve (e.g., 2024).\n        k: The number of integers left to find (e.g., 5).\n        path: The list of integers found so far.\n        max_val: The maximum value the next integer can take, ensuring non-increasing order.\n    \"\"\"\n    global solution_sets\n    \n    # Base case: we have found k numbers\n    if k == 0:\n        if target == 0:\n            solution_sets.append(path)\n        return\n\n    # Pruning: If the target has become negative, this path is invalid\n    if target < 0:\n        return\n        \n    # Determine the search range for the next number 'x'.\n    # The upper bound for x is the minimum of max_val and sqrt(target).\n    upper_bound = min(max_val, int(math.sqrt(target)))\n    \n    # Iterate from the largest possible value downwards for efficiency\n    for x in range(upper_bound, -1, -1):\n        # Pruning optimization: If the sum of k copies of the largest possible\n        # remaining square (x*x) is less than the target, then no combination\n        # of smaller or equal squares can reach the target.
