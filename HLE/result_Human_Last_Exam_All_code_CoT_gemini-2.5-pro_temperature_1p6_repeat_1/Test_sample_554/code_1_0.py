# The chemical formula for the original nanocar molecule is C58H36.
num_hydrogen_in_nanocar = 36

# The prefix "perfluoro-" means that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.
num_fluorine_in_perfluoronanocar = num_hydrogen_in_nanocar

# Print out the reasoning and the final count.
print(f"The parent molecule, a nanocar, has {num_hydrogen_in_nanocar} hydrogen atoms.")
print("The 'perfluoro-' prefix indicates that every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.")
print(f"Therefore, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain {num_fluorine_in_perfluoronanocar} fluorine atoms.")
