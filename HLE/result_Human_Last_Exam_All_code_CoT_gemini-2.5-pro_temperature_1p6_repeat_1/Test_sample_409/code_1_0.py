# The question asks for the minimal cohomology degree where non-trivial extensions
# and obstructions become significant in semi-abelian categories. This is a
# standard result in homological algebra.

# Step 1: Define the minimal degree based on the roles of cohomology groups.
# H^0(B, M) deals with invariants.
# H^1(B, M) deals with derivations and split extensions.
# H^2(B, M) is the first to deal with non-trivial (non-split) extensions and obstructions.
minimal_degree = 2

# Step 2: Print the explanation.
print("In homological algebra and its generalization to semi-abelian categories, the roles of low-dimensional cohomology groups H^n(B, M) are well-defined.")
print(f"The minimal degree at which non-trivial extensions and obstructions become significant is {minimal_degree}.")
print("\nThis is because the second cohomology group, H^2(B, M), is the first group that:")
print("  - Classifies general (non-split) extensions of an object B by a module M.")
print("  - Contains the obstructions to solving various algebraic problems, such as lifting homomorphisms or deforming structures.")

# Step 3: Print the final expression representing the answer.
# This satisfies the requirement to "output each number in the final equation"
# by using the 'minimal_degree' variable.
print("\nThe mathematical expression for the relevant cohomology group is:")
