    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers ($Q_2$), we need to find its stable model and analyze the singularities of its special fiber (the reduction modulo 2).\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the initial curve and its reduction.** The given curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus `g=2`. Its reduction modulo 2 gives `y^2 = x^2`, which is a highly singular (non-reduced) line, so this is not the stable reduction.\n2.  **Find a better model.** We perform transformations to find a model of the curve with better reduction properties. A common technique is to find the minimal regular model.\n3.  **Analyze the minimal regular model's reduction.** We find that a transformed model, which is likely the minimal regular model, reduces to a curve with a cusp `(y^2=x^3+x^4)`. A cusp is not an ordinary double point, so this reduction is not yet stable.\n4.  **Analyze the structure of the stable reduction.** The stable model is obtained by resolving the cusp of the minimal regular model's reduction. The structure of the stable model's special fiber (a graph of curves) for a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the 2-adic valuations of its Weierstrass points (the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side, plus infinity).\n5.  **Cluster the Weierstrass points.** By calculating the 2-adic valuations of the Weierstrass points, we group them into \"clusters\". The number of clusters corresponds to the number of components in the stable reduction.\n6.  **Calculate the number of double points (`delta`).** For a stable reduction whose components form a tree structure (which is the case for hyperelliptic curves), the number of double points (`delta`, the number of edges in the tree) is one less than the number of components (`r`, the number of vertices). So, `delta = r - 1`.\n7.  **Verify with the genus formula.** The arithmetic genus of the stable reduction must equal the genus of the original curve (`g=2`). The formula is `g = sum(g_i) + delta - r + 1`, where `g_i` are the genera of the components.\n\n### Execution:\nThe Weierstrass points are the roots of `P(x) = 8x^5+4x^4+4x^3+x^2+8x`, plus the point at infinity.\n*   One root is `x=0`. Its 2-adic valuation `v_2(0)` is `+inf`.\n*   The point at infinity can be thought of as a root with valuation `-inf`.\n*   The other four roots are the roots of `Q(x) = 8x^4+4x^3+4x^2+x+8`. The Newton polygon for `Q(x)` shows one root with valuation `v_2=3` and three roots with valuation `v_2=-1`.\n\nWe can group these 6 Weierstrass points by their valuations into three clusters:\n1.  `C_1`: {point with `v_2=3`}\n2.  `C_2`: {points with `v_2=-1`} (contains 3 points)\n3.  `C_3`: {points `0, inf`} (contains 2 points)\n\nThis suggests the stable reduction consists of `r=3` components. Since the reduction graph is a tree, the number of double points `delta` is given by `delta = r - 1`.\n\nThis gives `delta = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n\nWe can verify this with the genus formula for the stable reduction `C_s`. The formula connects the genus of the original curve `g` to the genera of the components `g_i` and the graph structure (`delta` and `r`):\n`g = sum(g_i) + delta - r + 1`\n\nSubstituting the values `g=2`, `delta=2`, `r=3`:\n`2 = sum(g_i) + 2 - 3 + 1`\n`2 = sum(g_i) + 0`\nThis means the sum of the genera of the components must be 2, which is consistent and possible. Thus, the analysis leads to 2 double points.\n\n```python\n# The equation for the curve is y^2 = P(x)\n# P(x) = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\n\n# The genus of the curve C is g.\n# For a hyperelliptic curve y^2 = P(x) where deg(P) = 2g + 1 or 2g + 2\n# Here, deg(P) = 5. So, 2g + 1 = 5, which gives g = 2.\ng = 2\n\n# Based on the analysis of the 2-adic valuations of the Weierstrass points,\n# the stable reduction consists of a tree of components.\n# The number of components 'r' is determined by clustering the points.\n# The analysis suggests r=3 components.\nr = 3\n\n# For a tree-like structure, the number of double points 'delta' is related to 'r' by:\n# delta = r - 1\ndelta = r - 1\n\n# We verify this with the genus formula for stable reduction:\n# g = sum_of_component_genera + delta - r + 1\n# This gives: 2 = sum(g_i) + (r-1) - r + 1 = sum(g_i)\n# This means the sum of the genera of the components is 2, which is consistent.\n\nprint(f\"The number of components in the stable reduction is r = {r}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of double points is delta = r - 1 = {delta}.\")\n\n# The final verification is based on the genus formula for stable curves:\n# g = sum_gi + delta - r + 1\n# Let's print the numbers in this final equation, assuming sum_gi = 2.\nsum_gi = 2\nequation_g = g\nequation_sum_gi = sum_gi\nequation_delta = delta\nequation_r = r\nprint(\"\\nVerifying with the genus formula g = sum(g_i) + delta - r + 1:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_g} = {equation_sum_gi} + {equation_delta} - {equation_r} + 1\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
