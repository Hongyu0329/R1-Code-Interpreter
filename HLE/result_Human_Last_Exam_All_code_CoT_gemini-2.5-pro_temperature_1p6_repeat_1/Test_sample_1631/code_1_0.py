# The scientific basis for adding bypass notches in sheet metal stamping dies is to manage the flow of material during the forming process.

# When a sheet metal blank is stamped into a die with complex geometries, such as sharp corners, small radii, or deep-drawn sections, the material flow can become restricted.
# This restriction can lead to defects like excessive thinning, splitting, or wrinkling.

# A bypass notch (also known as a cheater notch or relief notch) is an intentional cutout added to the perimeter of the blank in a specific area.
# This notch provides a path of least resistance, allowing the material to flow more easily around the difficult geometric feature and properly fill the die cavity.
# This controlled inflow of material prevents the concentration of stress and strain that would otherwise cause defects.

# Therefore, the primary purpose is to solve problems related to material flow into complex die cavities.
# Among the given choices, option D most accurately describes this function.

# The final answer is D.
# The code below will print the letter of the correct answer.
