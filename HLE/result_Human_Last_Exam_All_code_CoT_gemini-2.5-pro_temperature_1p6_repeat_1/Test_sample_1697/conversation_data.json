    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the final product of the reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**: The reaction starts with `N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide`. The reagents are `sec-BuLi`/`TMEDA` in the first step and `methyl iodide` in the second.\n2.  **Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**:\n    *   `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base, and `TMEDA` enhances its reactivity and directs it. This combination is classic for deprotonating a specific proton on an aromatic ring in a process called Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM).\n    *   The starting material has two functional groups that can direct this deprotonation: the N,N-diethylamide (`-CONEt2`) at position 1 and the dimethylamino (`-NMe2`) group at position 3.\n    *   The amide group is a powerful directing group, guiding the base to remove a proton from its *ortho* positions (C2 or C6).\n    *   The dimethylamino group also directs the base to its *ortho* positions (C2 or C4).\n    *   Since both groups direct the deprotonation to the C2 position, this site is synergistically activated. The proton at C2 is the most acidic and will be removed by `sec-BuLi`. This forms a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate.\n3.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**:\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate, with its nucleophilic carbon at position C2, is then treated with methyl iodide (`CH3I`).\n    *   The C2 carbanion attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion.\n4.  **Final Product**: A methyl group is attached to the C2 position of the benzene ring. The final product is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines the process and prints the final product.\n\n```python\ndef chemical_reaction_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the product of a two-step organic synthesis reaction.\n    It identifies the reaction type, analyzes the regioselectivity, and names the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the reaction components\n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    reagents_step1 = \"sec-BuLi, TMEDA, THF\"\n    reagents_step2 = \"methyl iodide (CH3I)\"\n    \n    # Analyze the reaction and determine the product\n    # The reaction is a directed ortho-metalation followed by electrophilic quench.\n    # The -CONEt2 group (position 1) directs to positions 2 and 6.\n    # The -N(CH3)2 group (position 3) directs to positions 2 and 4.\n    # The synergistic effect makes position 2 the most acidic and reactive site.\n    # A methyl group is therefore added at position 2.\n    final_product = \"N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    \n    # Print the reaction summary\n    print(\"--- Reaction Summary ---\")\n    print(f\"Starting Material: {starting_material}\")\n    print(f\"Step 1 Reagents: {reagents_step1}\")\n    print(f\"Step 2 Reagents: {reagents_step2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n    \n    # Print the explanation of how the product is formed\n    print(\"\\n--- Rationale ---\")\n    print(\"1.
