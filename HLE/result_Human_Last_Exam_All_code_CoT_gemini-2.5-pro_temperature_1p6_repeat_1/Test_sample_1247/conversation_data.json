    "Answering this question requires us to find the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions.\n\n### Understanding the notation\n- A permutation \\(\\pi\\) of length \\(n\\) is an arrangement of the numbers \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\).\n- An inversion in \\(\\pi\\) is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\).\n- A permutation \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\).\n- \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) denotes the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) with exactly \\(k\\) inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nWe are asked to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\n### Plan\nThe key insight is that for a fixed number of inversions \\(k\\), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations, \\(av_n^k(1324)\\), becomes constant for sufficiently large \\(n\\). Specifically, the value stabilizes for \\(n \\ge 2k\\).\n\nIn our case, \\(k=3\\) and \\(n=333\\). The condition \\(n \\ge 2k\\) becomes \\(333 \\ge 2 \\times 3\\), which is \\(333 \\ge 6\\). This condition is met.\nTherefore, the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is the same as \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) for any \\(n \\ge 6\\). We can compute this value for a small \\(n\\), such as \\(n=6\\), which is computationally feasible.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Generate all permutations of length \\(n=6\\).\n2.  For each permutation, count the number of inversions.\n3.  If the number of inversions is exactly 3, check if the permutation avoids the 1324 pattern.\n4.  Count the number of such permutations. This count will be our answer.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform these steps. The script will use `itertools.permutations` to generate the permutations and will have helper functions to count inversions and check for the 1324 pattern.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_inversions(p):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of inversions in a permutation.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    inv_count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if p[i] > p[j]:\n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\n\ndef has_1324_pattern(p):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a permutation contains the 1324 pattern.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    if n < 4:\n        return False\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                for l in range(k + 1, n):\n                    # Check for the 1324 pattern: p[i] < p[k] < p[j] < p[l]\n                    if p[i] < p[k] and p[k] < p[j] and p[j] < p[l]:\n                        return True\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates av_n^k(1324) for n>=2k by computing it for a small n.\n    For this problem, k=3, so we can choose n=6 (since 6 >= 2*3).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 6 \n    k = 3\n    target_n = 333\n\n    # Generate permutations of {0, 1, ..., n-1} and treat them as {1, 2, ..., n}\n    # for pattern checking, as relative order is all that matters.\n    elements = range(n)\n    count = 0\n    for p in itertools.permutations(elements):\n        if count_inversions(p) == k:\n            if not has_1324_pattern(p):\n                count += 1\n    \n    # The result for n=6 is the same for n=333\n    print(f\"av_{target_n}^{k}(1324) = {count}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<14>>>"
