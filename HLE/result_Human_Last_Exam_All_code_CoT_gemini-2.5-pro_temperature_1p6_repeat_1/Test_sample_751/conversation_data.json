    "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of duality to find the observer canonical form of the given discrete-time system.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the System:** Start with the given system matrices `A` and `C`.\n2.  **Construct the Dual System:** The dual of the system `(A, C)` is `(A_d, B_d)`, where `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`. The problem of finding the observer canonical form for `(A, C)` is equivalent to finding the controllable canonical form for its dual `(A_d, B_d)`.\n3.  **Create a Single-Input Dual System:** The dual system is a multi-input system since `C` (and thus `B_d = C^T`) has multiple rows/columns. We'll select the first column of `B_d` as our input vector `b_d` to create a single-input system `(A_d, b_d)` for which we can find a standard controllable canonical form. This corresponds to finding the observer form based on the first output of the original system.\n4.  **Find the Transformation Matrix (T):** We will compute the transformation matrix `T` that converts the dual system `(A_d, b_d)` into controllable canonical form `(A_c, b_c)`.\n    *   Calculate the characteristic polynomial of `A` (which is the same as for `A_d`).\n    *   Construct the controllability matrix `W_c` for `(A_d, b_d)`.\n    *   Use `W_c` and the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial to find the transformation matrix `T` using Ackermann's formula.\n5.  **Transform the System:** Once we have `T`, the transformation for the original system to observer canonical form is `Q = (T⁻¹)^T`.\n6.  **Calculate New C Matrix:** The new output matrix `C_o` in the observer canonical form is calculated as `C_o = C @ Q`. This will be the final answer.\n\nThe following Python script implements these steps.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the original system matrices\nA = np.array([\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 1],\n    [0, 2, 0]\n])\n\nC = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0]\n])\n\nn = A.shape[0]\n\n# Step 2: Construct the dual system\nA_d = A.T\nB_d = C.T\n\n# Step 3: Create a single-input dual system\n# We select the first column of B_d, which corresponds to the first row of C.\nb_d = B_d[:, 0:1] # Keep it as a column vector\n\n# Check if the pair (A_d, b_d) is controllable\nWc_check = np.hstack([b_d, A_d @ b_d, A_d @ A_d @ b_d])\nif np.linalg.matrix_rank(Wc_check) < n:\n    print(\"The dual system (A^T, c_1^T) is not controllable.\")\n    print(\"Cannot transform to controllable canonical form using this output.\")\nelse:\n    # Step 4: Find the transformation matrix T\n    # 4a: Calculate the characteristic polynomial of A: p(s) = s^n + a_1*s^(n-1) + ... + a_n\n    # np.poly(A) returns [1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\n    char_poly_coeffs = np.poly(A)\n    # The coefficients we need are a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\n    coeffs = char_poly_coeffs[1:]\n    \n    # 4b: Construct the matrix M for the Ackermann formula transformation\n    M = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n - i):\n            if i + j + 1 < n:\n                M[i, j] = coeffs[n - i - j - 2]\n            elif i + j + 1 == n:\n                M[i, j] = 1\n\n    # 4c: Construct the controllability matrix for the dual system (A_d, b_d)\n    Wc = np.hstack([np.linalg.matrix_power(A_d, i) @ b_d for i in range(n)])\n    # For standard controllable canonical form, we need Wc in reverse order of powers\n    Wc = np.fliplr(Wc)\n    \n    # 4d: Calculate the transformation matrix T\n    T = Wc @ M\n    \n    # Step 5: Get the transformation Q for the original system\n    T_inv = np.linalg.inv(T)\n    Q = T_inv.T\n    \n    # Step 6: Calculate the new C matrix in observer canonical form\n    C_new = C @ Q\n\n    # Output the result\n    print(\"The original matrix A is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nThe original matrix C is:\")\n    print(C)\n    print(\"\\nThe new matrix C in observer canonical form is:\")\n    # np.round is used to clean up potential floating point inaccuracies\n    print(np.round(C_new, decimals=5))\n\n    # We can also verify the new A matrix, A_o, is in observer canonical form\n    A_new = np.linalg.inv(Q) @ A @ Q\n    # print(\"\\nFor verification, the new matrix A in observer canonical form is:\")\n    # print(np.round(A_new, decimals=5))\n\n<<<\n[[0.  0.  1. ]\n [0.5 0.5 1.5]]\n>>>\n```"
