    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against a powerful quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum attack against symmetric-key cryptography.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the threat:** The primary threat to symmetric key encryption from quantum computers is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Explain Grover's Algorithm:** This algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, which includes brute-forcing a cryptographic key.\n3.  **Quantify the speedup:** For a key of length *n*, a classical computer would need up to 2^n operations (brute-force). Grover's algorithm reduces this to approximately sqrt(2^n) or 2^(n/2) operations.\n4.  **Establish a security baseline:** A key length of 128 bits is currently considered secure against classical computers. This means that performing 2^128 operations is infeasible. We will use this as our security target.\n5.  **Calculate the required quantum-resistant key length:** We need to find a new key length, let's call it *n_quantum*, such that the effort for a quantum computer to break it is at least as hard as the effort for a classical computer to break a 128-bit key.\n    *   Quantum effort to break *n_quantum*-bit key = 2^(n_quantum / 2)\n    *   Classical effort to break 128-bit key = 2^128\n    *   Set them as equivalent: 2^(n_quantum / 2) = 2^128\n    *   Solve for *n_quantum*.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quantum_symmetric_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length to be secure against a quantum computer.\n    \"\"\"\n    classical_security_level = 128\n\n    print(\"To determine the required symmetric key length for quantum resistance, we need to account for Grover's algorithm.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"1.
