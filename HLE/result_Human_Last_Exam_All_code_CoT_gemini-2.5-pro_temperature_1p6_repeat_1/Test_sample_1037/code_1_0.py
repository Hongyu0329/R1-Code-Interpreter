    This script solves the given problem by determining the cardinalities of S/A, B/S, and H_1(B/A, Q).

    1.  The initial object A is (Z, id), so its group is Z.
    2.  The terminal object B is ({0}, 0), so its group is the trivial group {0}.
    3.  The scale S is the inclusion of Z into the hyperreals, so its group is *R.

    Calculations:
    - S/A is the quotient *R / Z. The cardinality of the hyperreals (*R) is Beth_1 (2^Aleph_0).
      Quotienting by the countable set Z does not change the cardinality. So, |S/A| = Beth_1.
    - B/S is the quotient {0} / Im(map from *R to {0}). The image is {0}.
      So, B/S = {0}/{0}, which is the trivial group of cardinality 1.
    - B/A is the quotient {0} / Im(map from Z to {0}). The image is {0}.
      So, B/A = {0}/{0}, the trivial group. We need H_1({0}, Q).
      The first homology group of a point (the trivial group) is trivial.
      So, H_1(B/A, Q) = {0}, and its cardinality is 1.

    The final cardinalities are Beth_1, 1, and 1.
