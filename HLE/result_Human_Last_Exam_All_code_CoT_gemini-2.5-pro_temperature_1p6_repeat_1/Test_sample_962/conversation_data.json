    "Of course. Designing a secure and efficient threshold signature scheme is a complex task in cryptography. One of the most prominent and well-regarded designs that fits your criteria is **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)**. It is based on the Schnorr signature scheme, is proven secure, and features a two-round signing protocol.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Setup Phase:** We will define the cryptographic parameters, including the total number of parties (`n`) and the threshold (`t`). We'll use the `secp256k1` elliptic curve, which is standard in many cryptocurrencies.\n\n2.  **Key Generation (Simulated):** In a real-world scenario, a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol would be used. For this example, we will simulate it. A trusted dealer will:\n    *   Create a master secret key.\n    *   Use Shamir's Secret Sharing to split the key into `n` shares.\n    *   Distribute one secret share to each of the `n` participants.\n    *   Compute and make public the group's public key.\n\n3.  **Signing Protocol (Two Rounds):** We will select `t` participants to generate a signature for a given message.\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each of the `t` participating signers will independently generate a secret nonce and compute a public commitment from it. They will then broadcast this commitment to the other participants.\n    *   **Round 2 (Signature Share):** After receiving commitments from all other `t-1` participants, each signer will compute a group commitment and a challenge hash. They will use this, their secret share, and their nonce to compute their partial signature, which they will send to a signature aggregator.\n\n4.  **Aggregation and Verification:**\n    *   The signature aggregator (which can be one of the participants) gathers the `t` partial signatures and combines them into a single, final signature.\n    *   Finally, anyone with the group's public key can verify this signature against the original message. The verification step will be printed explicitly.\n\nThe following Python code implements this scheme. It uses the `fastecdsa` library for elliptic curve operations, which you may need to install (`pip install fastecdsa`).\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\nfrom math import prod\n\n# Using fastecdsa for elliptic curve operations.
