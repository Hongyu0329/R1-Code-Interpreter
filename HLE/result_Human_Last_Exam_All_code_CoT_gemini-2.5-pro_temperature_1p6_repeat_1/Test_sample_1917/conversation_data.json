    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ as $a$ takes on all positive integer values.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the periodicity of the sequence**: The value of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is determined by properties of $a$ under different moduli. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equivalent to the system of congruences:\n    *   $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{2}$\n    *   $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{11}$\n\n    The first congruence, $a^a \\pmod 2$, depends on the parity of $a$, which means it depends on $a \\pmod 2$.\n    The second congruence, $a^a \\pmod{11}$, depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent. By Fermat's Little Theorem, if $a$ is not a multiple of 11, the exponent's behavior is periodic with period 10 (since $\\phi(11) = 10$). So, this depends on $a \\pmod{10}$.\n\n    The sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is therefore determined by the triplet $(a \\pmod 2, a \\pmod{11}, a \\pmod{10})$. The behavior of this triplet is periodic with a period of $\\text{lcm}(2, 11, 10) = 110$.\n    Thus, we only need to check the values for $a = 1, 2, \\ldots, 110$ to find all possible remainders.\n\n2.  **Method of Calculation**: For each $a$ from 1 to 110, we will calculate $a^a \\pmod{22}$. A direct computation might involve very large numbers. A more robust method is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem, as outlined above. This involves solving the system of congruences for each $a$. For example, for $a=3$:\n    *   $x \\equiv 3^3 \\pmod 2 \\implies x \\equiv 27 \\pmod 2 \\implies x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   $x \\equiv 3^3 \\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 27 \\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   Solving this system, we find $x=5$ is the unique solution modulo 22. So, $3^3 \\pmod{22} = 5$.\n\n3.  **Python Implementation**: We will write a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will:\n    *   Loop through $a$ from 1 to 110.\n    *   For each $a$, it will calculate $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ using Python's `pow()` function.\n    *   It will then find the unique solution $x \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 21\\}$ to the system $x \\equiv r_2 \\pmod 2$ and $x \\equiv r_{11} \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   All unique values of $x$ will be collected in a set.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the sorted list of unique remainders and the cardinality of the set.\n\nThis approach ensures correctness by relying on the well-established Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22 : a is a positive integer}.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The sequence a^a mod 22 is periodic. The period divides lcm(2, 11, 10) = 110.\n    # So we only need to check for a from 1 to 110.\n    limit = 110\n    remainders = set()\n\n    for a in range(1, limit + 1):\n        # We use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find x = a^a mod 22.\n        # This is equivalent to solving the system:\n        # x = a^a (mod 2)\n        # x = a^a (mod 11)\n        \n        rem_2 = pow(a, a, 2)\n        rem_11 = pow(a, a, 11)\n        \n        # We now find the unique solution x in {0, ..., 21}.\n        for x in range(22):\n            if x % 2 == rem_2 and x % 11 == rem_11:\n                remainders.add(x)\n                break\n    \n    sorted_remainders = sorted(list(remainders))\n    \n    # Print each number in the final set.\n    print(\"The distinct values of a^a (mod 22) are:\")\n    for r in sorted_remainders:\n        print(r)\n        \n    cardinality = len(sorted_remainders)\n    print(f\"\\nThe cardinality of the set is: {cardinality}\")\n\nsolve_cardinality()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
