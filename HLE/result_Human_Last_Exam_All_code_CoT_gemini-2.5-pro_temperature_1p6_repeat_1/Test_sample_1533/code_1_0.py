# The problem asks to find the ratio BM/MI in terms of the side lengths a, b, and c of triangle ABC.
#
# a: length of side BC (opposite vertex A)
# b: length of side AC (opposite vertex B)
# c: length of side AB (opposite vertex C)
#
# Based on the geometric and trigonometric derivation, the ratio is expressed by a simple formula.
# This script prints the derived formula.

numerator_term_1 = "a"
numerator_term_2 = "c"
denominator_term = "b"

# Print the final expression, stating what each term represents.
print("In triangle ABC, let the side lengths be a, b, and c.")
print(f"The ratio of the lengths of the segments BM to MI is equal to ({numerator_term_1} + {numerator_term_2}) / {denominator_term}")

# The final equation and its components as requested.
