    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a Python script to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\nFirst, I will set up a coordinate system to represent the two cubes. Let's place the first cube (Cube 1) in the first octant with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (1,1,1). Its boundaries are `0 <= x <= 1`, `0 <= y <= 1`, and `0 <= z <= 1`.\n\nThe \"main diagonal\" of this cube connects (0,0,0) to (1,1,1), represented by the vector (1,1,1). The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is interpreted to mean the shift vector is half of the main diagonal vector. So, the shift vector is `1/2 * (1,1,1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\nThis means the second cube (Cube 2) is shifted by 1/2 unit in each of the x, y, and z directions relative to Cube 1. Its boundaries will be `1/2 <= x <= 3/2`, `1/2 <= y <= 3/2`, and `1/2 <= z <= 3/2`.\n\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where these two cubes overlap. This overlapping region is itself a cube. I will calculate its side length and then its volume.\n\nThe python code below will perform these calculations and print out each step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cube_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two unit cubes shifted\n    by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Side length of the two identical cubes\n    side_length_L = 1\n    \n    # The shift is 1/2 along the main diagonal. We interpret this as a shift\n    # vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). So the shift along each axis is 1/2.\n    shift_s = 0.5\n    \n    print(f\"Let's assume the first cube occupies the region from 0 to {side_length_L} on each axis.\")\n    print(f\"The second cube is shifted by {shift_s} along each axis.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The intersection of the two cubes forms a smaller cube.\n    # We calculate the side length of this intersection cube.\n    # The interval for the first cube on an axis is [0, L].\n    # The interval for the second cube on an axis is [s, L+s].\n    # The intersection of [0, L] and [s, L+s] is [s, L].\n    # The length of this intersection is L - s.\n    \n    intersect_side_length = side_length_L - shift_s\n    \n    print(f\"The side length of the original cubes is L = {side_length_L}.\")\n    print(f\"The shift distance along each axis is s = {shift_s}.\")\n    print(f\"The side length of the intersection cube is L_intersect = L - s = {side_length_L} - {shift_s} = {intersect_side_length}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The volume of the intersection cube is its side length cubed.\n    volume = intersect_side_length ** 3\n    \n    print(\"The volume of the intersection is the cube of its side length.\")\n    # The final equation is printed with each number, as requested.\n    print(f\"Volume = {intersect_side_length} * {intersect_side_length} * {intersect_side_length} = {volume}\")\n\nsolve_cube_intersection()\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
