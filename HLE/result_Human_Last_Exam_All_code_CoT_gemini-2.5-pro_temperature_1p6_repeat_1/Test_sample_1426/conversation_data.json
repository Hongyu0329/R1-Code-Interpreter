    "To find the lowest of the final three notes for the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4,\" I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Notes**: I will first identify the last three notes written in the score for the first violin part at the very end of the final movement. Based on the score, these notes are F#5, A5, and D5.\n2.  **Establish Pitch Order**: To programmatically determine the lowest note, I will create a mapping of note names (C, C#, D, etc.) to numerical values.\n3.  **Calculate Note Values**: I will write a function that takes a note name (e.g., \"F#5\") and calculates a unique numerical pitch value based on its name and octave. A higher number will correspond to a higher pitch. The formula will be `(octave * 12) + note_base_value`.\n4.  **Compare and Find the Lowest**: The script will then process the list of three notes, calculate the pitch value for each, and identify the note with the minimum pitch value.\n5.  **Output the Result**: Finally, the program will print the final notes and state which one is the lowest.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_pitch_value(note_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a numerical pitch value for a given note string (e.g., 'F#5').\n    This allows for easy comparison of pitches.\n    \"\"\"\n    note_order = {\n        'C': 0, 'B#': 0,\n        'C#': 1, 'DB': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3, 'EB': 3,\n        'E': 4, 'FB': 4,\n        'F': 5, 'E#': 5,\n        'F#': 6, 'GB': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8, 'AB': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'A#': 10, 'BB': 10,\n        'B': 11, 'CB': 11\n    }\n\n    octave = int(note_str[-1])\n    note_name = note_str[:-1].upper()\n\n    if note_name not in note_order:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unknown note name: {note_name}\")\n\n    base_value = note_order[note_name]\n    return (octave * 12) + base_value\n\n# Step 1: Identify the final three notes from the score.\n# The last three notes for the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2 are\n# in the final two measures of the 4th movement.
