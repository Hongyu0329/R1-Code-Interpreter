    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a problem in applied category theory, and we can solve it by breaking it down into cases based on how the morphisms are distributed.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Establish the Basics**: A category with 2 objects (let's call them `0` and `1`) must have two identity morphisms, `id_0: 0 -> 0` and `id_1: 1 -> 1`. We are given 4 morphisms in total, so this leaves us with `4 - 2 = 2` non-identity morphisms to place. Let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\n2.  **Define Hom-sets**: The structure of the category is determined by the `Hom-sets`, which are the sets of morphisms between any two objects. We have four such sets: `Hom(0,0)`, `Hom(0,1)`, `Hom(1,0)`, and `Hom(1,1)`.\n\n3.  **Partition the Non-Identity Morphisms**: The 2 non-identity morphisms `f` and `g` can be distributed among the four Hom-sets in two main ways:\n    *   **Case 1**: Both morphisms are in the *same* Hom-set (e.g., `f, g: 0 -> 0`).\n    *   **Case 2**: The two morphisms are in *different* Hom-sets (e.g., `f: 0 -> 0` and `g: 0 -> 1`).\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Case**: For each distribution, we'll determine the number of unique, non-isomorphic category structures that can be formed. This involves defining the composition rules for the morphisms and ensuring they satisfy the category axioms (associativity and identity). We will need to use some known results, such as the number of non-isomorphic monoids of a certain size.\n\n5.  **Sum the Results**: The total number of categories will be the sum of the counts from all possible non-isomorphic configurations.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan by calculating the number of categories for each case and summing them up.\n\n```python\ndef count_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    \n    This is a combinatorial problem in category theory.
