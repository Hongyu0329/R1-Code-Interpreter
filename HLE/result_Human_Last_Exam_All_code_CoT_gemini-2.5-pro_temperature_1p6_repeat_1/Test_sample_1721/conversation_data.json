    "The problem asks for the largest constant `c` such that there exists a large subset `A` of `{1, ..., N}` with size `|A|` approximately `cN`, where the sumset `A+A = {a1 + a2 | a1, a2 in A}` contains no perfect squares.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Method**: A powerful way to construct such a set `A` is to use modular arithmetic. We choose a modulus `m` and define `A` as the set of all numbers `n` in `{1, ..., N}` that fall into a specific set of residue classes `B` modulo `m`. That is, `A = {n in {1, ..., N} | n mod m in B}`.\n2.  **Condition on B**: If `a1` and `a2` are in `A`, their residues `b1 = a1 mod m` and `b2 = a2 mod m` must be in `B`. The sum `a1 + a2` will have residue `b1 + b2 mod m`. For `a1 + a2` not to be a square number, we can enforce a stronger condition: `a1 + a2` is not a square modulo `m`. This means `(b1 + b2) mod m` should not be in the set of quadratic residues modulo `m`, `S_m = {k^2 mod m | k in Z}`.\n3.  **Optimization**: The density of our constructed set `A` is `c = |B| / m`. To find the largest `c`, we need to find a pair `(m, B)` that maximizes this ratio.\n4.  **Computational Search**: I will write a Python script to perform this search. The script will:\n    a. Iterate through moduli `m` from 2 up to a reasonable limit.\n    b. For each `m`, determine the set of squares `S_m`.\n    c. Find the largest possible subset `B` of `{0, 1, ..., m-1}` such that the sumset `B+B` (modulo `m`) is disjoint from `S_m`. This is a search problem that can be solved with a backtracking algorithm.\n    d. Calculate the density `c_m = |B|/m` for each `m` and keep track of the maximum value found.\n5.  **Result**: The code will print the best density `c` it finds, along with the corresponding `m` and `B` that achieve this density. Based on the output and known mathematical results, I will state the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the best modulus m and residue set B to construct a set A\n    such that A+A contains no squares, maximizing the density |A|/N.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The search for m is limited to a reasonable number, as the search for B\n    # is computationally expensive (exponential in m).\n    max_m = 30\n    if len(sys.argv) > 1:\n        try:\n            max_m = int(sys.argv[1])\n            print(f\"Running search for m up to {max_m}.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(f\"Invalid argument.
