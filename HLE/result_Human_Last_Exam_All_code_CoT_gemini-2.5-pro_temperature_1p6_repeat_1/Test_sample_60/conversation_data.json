    "To solve this problem, I will simulate each of the three Turing Machines on an empty tape (all zeros) and count the number of steps each one takes to reach the 'H' (Halt) state. The machine that takes the most steps is the answer.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Represent the Turing Machine:** I will create a data structure, specifically a dictionary, to hold the rules for each machine. The rules are given in a specific order: State A (for reading 0, for reading 1), State B (for 0, for 1), and so on for C, D, and E.\n2.  **Represent the Tape:** An infinitely long tape is best modeled using a dictionary in Python, where keys are cell positions and values are the symbols (0 or 1). This is efficient because we only need to store the non-zero cells. An un-stored cell is assumed to contain a 0.\n3.  **Simulation Loop:** For each machine, I will start in state 'A' at position 0 on the tape. The simulation will proceed step-by-step:\n    a. Read the symbol on the tape at the current head position.\n    b. Look up the corresponding rule for the current state and symbol.\n    c. Perform the actions specified by the rule: write a new symbol to the tape, move the head left or right, and transition to a new state.\n    d. Increment a step counter.\n4.  **Halt Condition:** The loop will continue until the machine's state becomes 'H'.\n5.  **Compare Results:** After running the simulation for all three machines, I will compare the step counts to find the maximum. The problem asks for which machine it is and the number of steps. My code will print the step count for each machine and then identify the winner and the maximum step count.\n\n```python\ndef simulate_turing_machine(rule_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a 5-state, 2-symbol Turing Machine and returns the number of steps to halt.\n\n    Args:\n        rule_string: A space-separated string of transition rules for states A through E.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of steps until the machine reaches the 'H' (Halt) state.\n    \"\"\"\n    parts = rule_string.split()\n    states = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\n    rules = {}\n\n    # Parse the rule string into a nested dictionary for easy lookup.\n    # The format is rules[current_state][read_symbol] = (next_state, write_symbol, direction)\n    for i, state in enumerate(states):\n        rules[state] = {}\n        # Rule for reading a 0\n        rule0_str = parts[2 * i]\n        rules[state][0] = (rule0_str[0], int(rule0_str[1]), rule0_str[2])\n        # Rule for reading a 1\n        rule1_str = parts[2 * i + 1]\n        rules[state][1] = (rule1_str[0], int(rule1_str[1]), rule1_str[2])\n\n    # Initialize the machine's components\n    tape = {}  # A dictionary to represent the sparse, infinite tape\n    head_position = 0\n    current_state = 'A'  # By convention, the start state is 'A'\n    steps = 0\n\n    # Main simulation loop, continues until the Halt state 'H' is reached\n    while current_state != 'H':\n        # Get the value from the tape at the current position.\n        # If a position is not in the dictionary, it's a blank cell (0).\n        current_symbol = tape.get(head_position, 0)\n\n        # Look up the transition rule for the current state and symbol\n        next_state, symbol_to_write, direction_to_move = rules[current_state][current_symbol]\n\n        # Update the tape with the new symbol\n        tape[head_position] = symbol_to_write\n\n        # Move the head Left ('L') or Right ('R')\n        if direction_to_move == 'R':\n            head_position += 1\n        elif direction_to_move == 'L':\n            head_position -= 1\n\n        # Transition to the next state\n        current_state = next_state\n        \n        # Increment the step counter\n        steps += 1\n\n    return steps\n\ndef solve_and_print():\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines the machines, simulates them, and prints the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    machines = [\n        \"B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L\",  # Machine 1\n        \"B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R\",  # Machine 2\n        \"B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R\"   # Machine 3\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    # Loop through each machine, simulate it, and store the result\n    for i, rules in enumerate(machines):\n        step_count = simulate_turing_machine(rules)\n        results.append((i + 1, step_count))\n    \n    # Print the step count for each machine as requested\n    for machine_num, steps in results:\n        print(f\"{steps}\")\n\n    # Find the machine with the maximum number of steps\n    if results:\n        winner = max(results, key=lambda item: item[1])\n        print(f\"\\nMachine {winner[0]} halts after the most number of steps: {winner[1]}.\")\n\n# Run the simulation and print the final answer\nsolve_and_print()\n<<<3932>>>"
