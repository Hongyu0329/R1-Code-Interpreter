# The man is the musician Warren Zevon.
# Kurt Vonnegut was a great admirer of his work and they became friends.
# Zevon was known for his often wild, spiky hair, fitting the "porcupine" description.
# The riddle requires a two-word name starting with the same letter.
# While "Warren Zevon" does not fit, his full name was Warren William Zevon.
# "Warren William" satisfies all the clues in the riddle.
