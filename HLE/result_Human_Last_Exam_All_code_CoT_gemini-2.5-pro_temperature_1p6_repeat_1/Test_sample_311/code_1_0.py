# Based on the step-by-step analysis of the chemical synthesis:
# 1. Number of carbons from compound 11 present in compound 1.
# 2. Number of oxygens from compound 11 present in compound 14.
# 3. Number of nitrogens from compound 7 present in compound 10.

carbons_q1 = 2
oxygens_q2 = 1
nitrogens_q3 = 1

# Printing the results separated by commas
print(f"{carbons_q1},{oxygens_q2},{nitrogens_q3}")
