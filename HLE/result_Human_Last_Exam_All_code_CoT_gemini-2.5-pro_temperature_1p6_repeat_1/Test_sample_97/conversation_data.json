    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Chemical Reactions**: The dissolution of solid aluminum hydroxide, $Al(OH)_3$, in water involves two main equilibrium reactions:\n    *   The dissolution into ions: $Al(OH)_3(s) \\rightleftharpoons Al^{3+}(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)$, with the solubility product constant, $K_{sp} = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$.\n    *   The formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion: $Al(OH)_3(s) + OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$. The equilibrium constant for this, let's call it $K_c$, can be derived by combining the $K_{sp}$ reaction and the given complex formation reaction, $Al^{3+}(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$, which has a formation constant $K_f = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$. The combined constant is $K_c = K_{sp} \\times K_f$.\n\n2.  **Define Solubility**: The total molar solubility, S, is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species: $S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$.\n\n3.  **Set Up the Governing Equation**: To solve for the unknown concentrations, we use the principle of charge neutrality. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges in the solution. The ions present are $H^+$, $Al^{3+}$, $OH^-$, and $Al(OH)_4^-$. The charge balance equation is:\n    $[H^+] + 3[Al^{3+}] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$.\n\n4.  **Express Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable**: We can express the concentration of each ion in terms of $[OH^-]$ using the equilibrium constant expressions ($K_w$, $K_{sp}$, $K_c$).\n    *   $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]}$\n    *   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n    *   $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_c \\times [OH^-] = (K_{sp} \\times K_f) \\times [OH^-]$\n\n5.  **Solve for $[OH^-]$**: By substituting these expressions into the charge balance equation, we get a single equation with $[OH^-]$ as the only unknown. This equation can be solved to find the hydroxide ion concentration.\n\n6.  **Calculate Solubility**: Once $[OH^-]$ is known, we can calculate the concentrations of $[Al^{3+}]$ and $[Al(OH)_4^-]$ and sum them to find the total solubility, S.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, considering both dissolution\n    and complex ion formation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known constants\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27\n    K_f = 1.1e-31\n    K_w = 1.0e-14\n    \n    # K for the reaction Al(OH)3(s) + OH-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4-(aq)\n    K_c = K_sp * K_f\n\n    # The charge balance equation leads to a quadratic equation for x = [OH-]^2:\n    # (1 + K_sp*K_f)*[OH-]^4 - K_w*[OH-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\n    # Let x = [OH-]^2, then we have Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\n    \n    A = 1 + K_c\n    B = -K_w\n    C = -3 * K_sp\n\n    # Solve the quadratic equation for x = [OH-]^2 using the quadratic formula\n    # x = (-B + sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A (we take the positive root)\n    discriminant = math.sqrt(B**2 - 4*A*C)\n    x = (-B + discriminant) / (2*A)\n\n    # Calculate concentrations\n    oh_conc = math.sqrt(x)\n    al3_conc = K_sp / (oh_conc**3)\n    aloh4_conc = K_c * oh_conc\n    \n    # Total solubility S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n    solubility = al3_conc + aloh4_conc\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"This script calculates the molar solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is based on charge balance and simultaneous equilibria.\\n\")\n    print(f\"The equilibrium hydroxide concentration [OH-] is calculated to be: {oh_conc:.4e} mol L^-1\\n\")\n    print(\"The final solubility (S) is the sum of the dissolved aluminum species:\")\n    print(\"S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The concentration of Al^3+ is:\")\n    print(f\"[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3 = {K_sp:.2e} / ({oh_conc:.4e})^3 = {al3_conc:.4e} mol L^-1\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe concentration of Al(OH)4^- is:\")\n    print(f\"[Al(OH)4^-] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH-] = ({K_c:.2e}) * {oh_conc:.4e} = {aloh4_conc:.4e} mol L^-1\")\n\n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Total Molar Solubility:\")\n    print(f\"S = {al3_conc:.4e} + {aloh4_conc:.4e} = {solubility:.4e} mol L^-1\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Return the final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{solubility:.4e}>>>\")\n\ncalculate_solubility()\n```"
