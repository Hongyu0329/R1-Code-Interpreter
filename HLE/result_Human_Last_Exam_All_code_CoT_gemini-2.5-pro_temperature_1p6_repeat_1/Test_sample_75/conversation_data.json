    "Based on the established StarCraft lore, the Second Great War is generally considered to encompass the events from the Brood War through the end of the Legacy of the Void campaign.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the start year of this period, which is the beginning of the Brood War in the year **2500**.\n2.  Define the end year, which is the conclusion of the main conflict against Amon in the Legacy of the Void epilogue, year **2506**.\n3.  Calculate the duration by subtracting the start year from the end year.\n4.  The result will be an integer, so rounding up will not change its value.\n5.  Finally, I will display the equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore is a prolonged conflict.\n# For the purpose of this calculation, we'll consider its start to be the beginning\n# of the Brood War, which set the stage for the events of StarCraft II.\n\nstart_year = 2500\n\n# The war's main conflict concludes with the defeat of the dark god Amon in the\n# Legacy of the Void epilogue.\n\nend_year = 2506\n\n# Calculate the total duration in years.\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The request is to round up, but since the result is a whole number,\n# rounding up doesn't change it.\nrounded_duration = duration\n\n# Print the equation and the final answer.\nprint(f\"The duration of the Second Great War is calculated from the end year minus the start year.\")\nprint(f\"Equation: {end_year} - {start_year} = {rounded_duration}\")\nprint(f\"The war lasted for {rounded_duration} years.\")\n\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
