    "To determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule, we must consult the standards set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically Chapter <797> on sterile compounding.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **Identify the container type:** The user specified a \"single dose container ampule.\" An ampule is a sealed glass container that must be broken to access its contents.\n2.  **Understand the implications of the container type:** Once an ampule is broken, it becomes an open system that cannot be resealed. This makes it highly susceptible to contamination.\n3.  **Apply USP <797> guidelines:** According to USP <797>, because an ampule cannot be sealed after opening, its contents must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored for any period.\n4.  **Determine the BUD:** \"Immediate use\" means there is no allowable storage time after the medication is drawn up from the ampule. Therefore, the Beyond-Use Date is effectively immediate, which can be quantified as 0 hours of storage time.\n5.  **Formulate the code:** I will write a simple Python script that defines the storage time in hours as 0 and prints a clear statement explaining the rule. This will fulfill the request to use code and output the relevant number.\n\n```python\ndef get_ampule_bud():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    according to USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to USP <797>, an opened ampule cannot be stored.\n    # It must be used immediately.\n    container_type = \"single-dose ampule\"\n    allowable_storage_time_hours = 0\n    \n    # The final rule is based on the inability to reseal an ampule.\n    # Therefore, the equation for the BUD is: Time of Use = Time of Puncture + 0 hours.\n    \n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a {container_type} opened in a sterile environment is immediate.\")\n    print(f\"It must be used immediately after opening, and any unused portion must be discarded.\")\n    print(f\"The allowable storage time is {allowable_storage_time_hours} hours.\")\n\nget_ampule_bud()\n```\n<<<Immediate use (0 hours)>>>"
