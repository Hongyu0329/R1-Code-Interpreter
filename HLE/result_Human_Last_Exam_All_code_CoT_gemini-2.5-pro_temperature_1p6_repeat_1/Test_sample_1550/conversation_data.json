    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  The problem requires finding the number of real intersection points for two given quadratic curves (quadrics). This is equivalent to finding the number of real solutions to a system of two polynomial equations with two variables.\n2.  I will use Python's symbolic computation library, `sympy`, to accurately model and solve the system of equations.\n3.  I'll define `x` and `y` as real symbolic variables and construct the two equations provided in the problem.\n4.  The `sympy.nonlinsolve()` function is ideal for this task. It solves systems of nonlinear equations and will return a set of all solution pairs `(x, y)`. Since I've declared `x` and `y` as real, the solver will only find real-valued solutions.\n5.  The number of real intersection points is simply the number of solution pairs in the set returned by `nonlinsolve()`.\n6.  The prompt includes a specific instruction: \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\". Since the question asks \"How many...\", the answer is a single number. I will represent this final numerical answer, let's call it `C`, with the trivial equation `1*x - C = 0`. The \"numbers in this final equation\" are its coefficients, so the code will print `1` and `-C`. This provides a consistent way to follow the instruction for any numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_intersection_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a system of two quadratic equations to find the number of real intersection points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
