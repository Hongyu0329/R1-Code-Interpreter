# The user wants me to select the best document for each question.
# The final answer format is "Q1_choice-Q2_choice".

# Question 1: "What animal's coat color changed as a baby?"
# Document 1 says: "at a few months old"
# Document 2 says: "As they reached puberty"
# "at a few months old" is a much better fit for "as a baby" than "puberty".
# Therefore, for Question 1, Document 1 is the better choice.
q1_choice = 1

# Question 2: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
# Both documents say: "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour."
# This answers the question. To break the tie, let's look at the context.
# Document 1 describes a contrast within the baby/infant period: bulls change color "at a few months old", while cows do not.
# Document 2 pushes the change for bulls to "puberty", a later stage.
# Document 1 provides a more complete and contrasting picture of what happens to coat colors during infancy.
# Therefore, for Question 2, Document 1 is the better choice.
q2_choice = 1

# The combined answer is "1-1".
# This corresponds to option A.
