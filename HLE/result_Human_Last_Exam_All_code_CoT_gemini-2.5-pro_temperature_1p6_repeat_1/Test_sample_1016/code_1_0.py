# T: The final time instant up to which convergence is required.
T = 8.5
# c: The propagation speed of the wave.
c = 2.0
# M: The size of the overlap region (M = b - a).
M = 3.0

# The number of iterations 'N' required for convergence up to time 'T'
# is the number of times a wave needs to cross the overlap 'M'.
# Each iteration allows the information to travel across the overlap once.
# The time this takes is M/c.
# So, we need N * (M/c) >= T, which means N >= T*c/M.
# Since N must be an integer, we take the ceiling.

# Calculate the intermediate value
intermediate_value = (T * c) / M

# Calculate the final number of iterations
num_iterations = math.ceil(intermediate_value)
