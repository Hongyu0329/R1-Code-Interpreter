    Solves the problem of finding the smallest possible number of complements for a topology.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of complements a non-trivial, non-discrete topology T
    on a set X with cardinality c can have.

    A topology S is a complement to T if:
    1. The union of their open sets, T U S, generates the discrete topology.
    2. Their intersection, T & S, is the trivial topology ({}, X).

    Here's the reasoning based on established mathematical theorems:

    Step 1: Can the number of complements be 0?
    No. It's a known theorem in topology that any non-trivial, non-discrete topology
    on an infinite set has at least one complement. So the minimum is >= 1.

    Step 2: Can the number of complements be 1?
    No. A key result, proven by Stephen Watson (1994), states that any non-trivial,
    non-discrete topology on an infinite set has at least two complements.
    Our set X has cardinality c (the continuum), which is infinite.
    Therefore, the minimum number must be >= 2.

    Step 3: Can the number of complements be 2?
    Yes. The same work by Watson provides a method to construct a topology on any
    infinite set that has exactly two complements. Since our set X is infinite,
    such a topology can be constructed.

    Conclusion:
    The smallest possible number of complements must be at least 2, and it is possible
    to have a topology with exactly 2 complements. Thus, the minimum number is 2.
