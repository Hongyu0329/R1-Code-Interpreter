    "Based on legal and historical analysis, the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the overarching principle of \"good faith\" into private law was the Contracts Law (General Part). Sections 12 and 39 of this law established general duties to act in good faith during negotiations and in the performance of contractual obligations, respectively. This principle has since been interpreted by Israeli courts as a fundamental doctrine applicable to all areas of civil law.\n\nSince this is a knowledge-based question and not a computational task, a code block is not applicable. I will provide the direct answer as requested.\n\n<<<Contracts Law (General Part)>>>"
