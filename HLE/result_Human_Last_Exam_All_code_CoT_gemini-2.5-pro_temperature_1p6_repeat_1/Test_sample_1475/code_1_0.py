        "2. The space 2^X, the set of all non-empty closed subsets of X with the Hausdorff metric, is known to be a complete metric space because X is complete. Since X is separable, 2^X is also separable. Thus, 2^X is a Polish space.",
        
        "3. The space P(X) is the subspace of 2^X consisting of sets which are closures of non-trivially convergent sequences. Such a set has exactly one limit point. It's a standard result in descriptive set theory that P(X) is a G_delta subset of 2^X (a countable intersection of open sets).",
        
        "4. As a G_delta subset of a Polish space (2^X), P(X) is itself completely metrizable (can be given a new metric that makes it complete). A completely metrizable space is a Baire space. The Baire Category Theorem states that in a Baire space, the intersection of countably many open dense subsets is itself a dense subset.",

        "   - P(X) is a perfect space (it has no isolated points). For any set A in P(X), we can slightly perturb one of the sequence points to create a new, distinct set B in P(X) that is arbitrarily close to A in the Hausdorff metric.",
        
        "6. So, P(X) is a perfect, separable, completely metrizable space. The intersection in question, let's call it G, is a dense G_delta subset of P(X).",

        "7. A fundamental theorem (a consequence of the Baire Category Theorem applied to Polish spaces) states that any non-empty G_delta subset of a perfect Polish space has the cardinality of the continuum, c.",

        "8. Since G is dense in the non-empty space P(X), G is non-empty. Therefore, the cardinality of G must be the cardinality of the continuum.",
