# The index of a linear boundary-value problem is defined as k - n, where
# n is the dimension of the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
# k is the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.

# Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system (n).
# The state vector is given as x(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), ..., x_2024(t)).
# The number of components in the vector x(t) determines the dimension of the system.
n = 2024
print(f"The dimension of the system is n = {n}.")

# Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).
# The given conditions are analyzed to find the unique ones.
# 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0
# 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0
# 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0 -> This is 5 * condition 2.
# 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0 -> This is 100 * condition 2.
# 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0 -> This is -1000 * condition 2.
# 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0 -> This is equivalent to x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0.
# The unique, linearly independent conditions are on x_1, x_2, and x_2024.
k = 3
print(f"The number of linearly independent boundary conditions is k = {k}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem.
index = k - n
print("\nThe formula for the index of the problem is: index = k - n")
print("Calculating the final value:")
print(f"index = {k} - {n} = {index}")
