    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the dimension of the system of ODEs (n).**\n    The dimension of the system corresponds to the number of unknown functions. The problem states that `x(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t), ..., x_2024(t))`. This means there are 2024 functions to be solved for. Therefore, the dimension `n = 2024`. Note that there seems to be a typo in the dimensions of matrix `A` and vector `I(t)`, which are given as 202000, but the system's dimension is determined by the state vector `x(t)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).**\n    We need to examine the given boundary conditions to identify how many of them are unique and not just multiples or combinations of others.\n    The given conditions are:\n    1.  `x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0`\n    2.  `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`\n    3.  `5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0` which simplifies to `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`. This is identical to condition 2.\n    4.  `100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0` which simplifies to `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`. This is also identical to condition 2.\n    5.  `1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0` which simplifies to `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`. This is also identical to condition 2.\n    6.  `100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0` which simplifies to `x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0`.\n\n    After removing the redundant (linearly dependent) conditions, we are left with three distinct conditions:\n    *   `x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0`\n    *   `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`\n    *   `x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0`\n    These three equations involve different components of the state vector (`x_1`, `x_2`, `x_2024`), making them linearly independent. Thus, the number of linearly independent boundary conditions `k = 3`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the index of the problem.**\n    The index of a boundary-value problem is defined as the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (`k`) minus the dimension of the system (`n`).\n    Index = `k - n`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The index of a linear boundary-value problem is defined as k - n, where\n# n is the dimension of the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\n# k is the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n# Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system (n).\n# The state vector is given as x(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), ..., x_2024(t)).\n# The number of components in the vector x(t) determines the dimension of the system.\nn = 2024\nprint(f\"The dimension of the system is n = {n}.\")\n\n# Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).\n# The given conditions are analyzed to find the unique ones.\n# 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n# 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n# 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0 -> This is 5 * condition 2.\n# 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0 -> This is 100 * condition 2.\n# 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0 -> This is -1000 * condition 2.\n# 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0 -> This is equivalent to x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0.\n# The unique, linearly independent conditions are on x_1, x_2, and x_2024.\nk = 3\nprint(f\"The number of linearly independent boundary conditions is k = {k}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem.\nindex = k - n\nprint(\"\\nThe formula for the index of the problem is: index = k - n\")\nprint(\"Calculating the final value:\")\nprint(f\"index = {k} - {n} = {index}\")\n\n```\n<<<-2021>>>"
