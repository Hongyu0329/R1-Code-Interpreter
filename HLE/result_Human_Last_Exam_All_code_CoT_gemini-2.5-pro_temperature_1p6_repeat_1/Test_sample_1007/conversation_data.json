    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one finishes in the same leg position as it starts:\n\n1.  **Analyze Entrechat six:** An `entrechat` is a step where the dancer jumps into the air and rapidly crosses their legs in front of and behind each other. The number (`six` in this case) refers to the number of leg movements. Even-numbered `entrechats` (like `quatre` or `six`) start and land in the same fifth position without changing which foot is in front.\n2.  **Analyze Échappé battu changé:** The word `changé` in ballet explicitly means \"changed.\" This step starts in fifth position and finishes in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front.\n3.  **Analyze Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg out and then jumping off the supporting leg to \"assemble\" both legs in the air and land in fifth position. Common forms like `assemblé dessus` (over) or `dessous` (under) result in changing the foot that is in front.\n4.  **Analyze Glissade derrière:** Meaning \"glide behind,\" this is a gliding step. When performing a `glissade derrière`, the dancer ends with the opposite foot in front compared to the starting position.\n5.  **Analyze Gargouillade:** This is a complex decorative step, similar to a `pas de chat` with a `rond de jambe` by each leg. It also results in the feet changing their front/back position upon landing.\n\nBased on this analysis, the `Entrechat six` is the only step listed that concludes with the legs in the same position as they started.\n\nHere is a Python script that programmatically determines and explains the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which has the same start and end leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps_data = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'changes_feet': False,\n            'explanation': 'An even-numbered entrechat.
