    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic part of the target space for the supersymmetric (SUSY) sigma-model corresponding to symmetry class D. This dimension gives the number of independent non-Grassmann (i.e., regular commuting) variables needed for parametrization.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical structure:** The target space of the SUSY sigma-model is a supermanifold. The non-Grassmann variables parametrize the bosonic part of this supermanifold.\n2.  **Decomposition of the bosonic sector:** For the sigma-models used in disordered systems, the bosonic part of the target supermanifold, let's call it `M_B`, is itself a product of two distinct manifolds: `M_B = M_BB × M_FF`.\n    *   `M_BB` arises from the boson-boson block of the model's central supermatrix field (`Q`).\n    *   `M_FF` arises from the fermion-fermion block.\n3.  **Identify manifolds for Class D:** For symmetry class D, the specific manifolds are:\n    *   `M_BB = O(N, N) / (O(N) × O(N))`, which is a non-compact symmetric space. `N` is the replica parameter.\n    *   `M_FF = Sp(2N, ℝ) / U(N)`, which is another non-compact symmetric space.\n4.  **Calculate the dimensions:** We need to find the dimensions of these two manifolds and add them.\n    *   The dimension of `M_BB` is given by the formula `dim(M_BB) = N²`.\n    *   The dimension of `M_FF` is given by `dim(M_FF) = N(N + 1)`.\n5.  **Sum the dimensions:** The total number of non-Grassmann variables is `dim(M_B) = dim(M_BB) + dim(M_FF) = N² + N(N + 1)`.\n6.  **Substitute the value of N:** The problem specifies \"two replicas,\" which means we must set `N = 2`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the final result breakdown.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem specifies \"two replicas\", which corresponds to N=2 in the model.\nN = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimension of the M_BB manifold: O(N,N) / (O(N) x O(N))\n# The formula for the dimension is N^2.\ndim_BB = N**2\n\n# Calculate the dimension of the M_FF manifold: Sp(2N,R) / U(N)\n# The formula for the dimension is N * (N + 1).\ndim_FF = N * (N + 1)\n\n# The total number of non-Grassmann variables is the sum of these two dimensions.\ntotal_dimension = dim_BB + dim_FF\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation.\n# We print each number in the final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"The total number of non-Grassmann variables is the sum of dimensions from the BB and FF sectors.\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of the BB sector (N^2): {N}^2 = {dim_BB}\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of the FF sector (N*(N+1)): {N}*({N}+1) = {dim_FF}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of variables = {dim_BB} + {dim_FF} = {total_dimension}\")\n\n```\n<<<10>>>"
