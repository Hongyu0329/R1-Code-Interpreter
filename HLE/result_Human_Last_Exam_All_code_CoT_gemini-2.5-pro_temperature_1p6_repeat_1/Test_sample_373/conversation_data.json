    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph Structure:** A \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" is typically interpreted as two identical, complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge, called the \"bridge\" or \"bottleneck\". Since there are 10 nodes in total, each complete graph must have 5 nodes (a K5 graph).\n2.  **Count the Edges:**\n    *   First, I'll calculate the number of edges within one K5 clique. A complete graph with `m` nodes has `m * (m - 1) / 2` edges.\n    *   Next, I'll calculate the total number of edges in the entire barbell graph. This will be the sum of edges from both cliques plus the single bottleneck edge connecting them.\n3.  **Define the Probability:** The problem assumes \"randomized uniform gossiping\". This implies that any edge in the graph has an equal probability of being selected.\n    *   The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of edges in the graph.\n    *   The number of favorable outcomes is the number of bottleneck edges, which is 1.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_barbell_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_nodes = 10\n    num_cliques = 2\n    num_bottleneck_edges = 1\n\n    # For a symmetric barbell graph, the nodes are split evenly between the cliques.\n    clique_size = total_nodes // num_cliques\n\n    # The number of edges in a complete graph (clique) with 'm' nodes is m * (m-1) / 2.\n    edges_per_clique = (clique_size * (clique_size - 1)) / 2\n    edges_per_clique = int(edges_per_clique)\n\n    # Total edges = (edges in clique 1) + (edges in clique 2) + (bottleneck edge).\n    total_edges = (num_cliques * edges_per_clique) + num_bottleneck_edges\n\n    # The probability is the ratio of bottleneck edges to total edges.\n    probability = num_bottleneck_edges / total_edges\n\n    print(f\"A barbell graph with {total_nodes} nodes consists of {num_cliques} cliques of size {clique_size}.\")\n    print(f\"Number of edges in one K{clique_size} clique = ({clique_size} * ({clique_size} - 1)) / 2 = {edges_per_clique}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of edges = (2 * {edges_per_clique}) + {num_bottleneck_edges} = {total_edges}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe probability of sampling the single bottleneck edge is the ratio of bottleneck edges to total edges.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"P(bottleneck) = {num_bottleneck_edges} / {total_edges}\")\n    print(f\"\\nResult: {probability:.4f}\")\n\nsolve_barbell_probability()\n\n```\n<<<0.0476>>>"
