def get_iupac_name_of_major_product():
    """
    This function determines the IUPAC name of the major product from the described reaction.

    Reaction Analysis:
    1.  Starting Material: ((2-((2-methylbut-3-en-2-yl)oxy)ethyl)sulfinyl)benzene
        Structure: Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2
        This is a beta-alkoxy sulfoxide.

    2.  Step 1: Sulfoxide Elimination.
        Heating a beta-alkoxy sulfoxide causes a thermal syn-elimination,
        producing an alkene and benzenesulfenic acid (PhSOH).
        Intermediate product: CH2=CH-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 (an allyl vinyl ether).

    3.  Step 2: Claisen Rearrangement.
        The allyl vinyl ether intermediate, under the same high-temperature conditions (180 Â°C),
        undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (Claisen rearrangement).
        This is an intramolecular, concerted reaction that is thermodynamically favorable.
        Rearrangement: CH2=CH-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2 -> CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-CHO

    4.  Step 3: IUPAC Naming of the Final Product.
        The final product is the aldehyde: CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-CHO
        - Principal functional group: Aldehyde (-CHO), at position C1.
        - Longest carbon chain: 5 carbons (pentanal).
        - Unsaturation: A double bond starts at C4 (pent-4-enal).
        - Substituents: Two methyl groups on C3 (3,3-dimethyl).
        - Final Name: 3,3-dimethylpent-4-enal
