  This function determines the upper bounds on the arboricity for the two cases.

  Case c=1:
  The subsampling probability is p_u = 1/d_u. It is a known result in random graph theory
  that this sampling strategy results in a graph whose arboricity is O(1)
  with high probability, for any starting graph G. This corresponds to category 1.

  Case c=2:
  The subsampling probability is p_u = 1/d_u^2. Since d_u >= 1, we have 1/d_u^2 <= 1/d_u.
  This means the vertex set of the graph sampled with c=2 is a subset of the vertex set
  of the graph sampled with c=1 (in a suitable coupling). Therefore, the resulting graph for c=2
  is an induced subgraph of the one for c=1. The arboricity of a subgraph cannot be larger
  than the arboricity of the graph itself. Thus, the arboricity for c=2 is also O(1).
  This corresponds to category 1.
