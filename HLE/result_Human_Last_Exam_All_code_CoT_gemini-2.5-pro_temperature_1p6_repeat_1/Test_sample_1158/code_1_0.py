1.  **Advantage Context:** Air-stable organic radicals are promising as they are 'doublet' emitters. This allows them to theoretically achieve 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) by bypassing the spin statistics that limit traditional fluorescent emitters to 25% IQE.

2.  **The Core Problem (The Disadvantage):** The key disadvantage stems directly from the fact that they are radicals, meaning they have an unpaired electron. This open-shell electronic structure makes them highly prone to a process called quenching.

3.  **Quenching Mechanism:** When an excited radical molecule (an exciton) gets very close to another radical molecule (which could be another exciton or even a ground-state radical), they can interact in a way that causes the excited state to return to the ground state without emitting a photon of light. This is a non-radiative decay pathway.

4.  **Impact on Performance:** This quenching process directly competes with the desired light-emitting process.
    - It reduces the number of excitons that produce light, which by definition lowers the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) of the OLED.
    - This quenching effect becomes much worse at high currents/brightness levels, leading to a severe 'efficiency roll-off', which is a major barrier to practical application.

5.  **Conclusion from Options:**
    - Option D, 'low EQE because excitons can be quenched by the radicals', correctly identifies this fundamental mechanism (quenching of excitons) and its direct impact on the key performance metric (EQE).
