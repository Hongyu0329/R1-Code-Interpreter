    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we can perform an exhaustive search. Here is my plan to solve this problem using a Python script:\n\n1.  **Represent the Operation**: A binary operation on a set can be represented by a Cayley table (or multiplication table). Let the set be `S = {0, 1, 2}`. The Cayley table will be a 3x3 matrix where the entry at row `i` and column `j` represents the result of `i * j`.\n\n2.  **Handle Commutativity**: The commutative property (`x * y = y * x`) means the Cayley table must be symmetric. This significantly reduces the number of operations we need to check. Instead of defining all `3 * 3 = 9` entries in the table, we only need to define the entries on and above the main diagonal. For a set of 3 elements, this is `3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6` entries. Each of these 6 entries can be any of the 3 elements in the set, so there are `3^6 = 729` unique commutative binary operations.\n\n3.  **Generate and Iterate**: I will write a script to generate all 729 possible commutative Cayley tables. The `itertools.product` function is perfect for generating these combinations.\n\n4.  **Check for Associativity**: For each generated commutative operation, the script will check if it is also associative. The associative property is `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` for all `x, y, z` in the set `S`. This check needs to be performed for all `3 * 3 * 3 = 27` possible triples of `(x, y, z)`.\n\n5.  **Count and Output**: A counter will be used to keep track of the number of operations that satisfy both properties. If an operation passes the associativity test for all 27 triples, the counter is incremented. Finally, the script will print the total count.\n\nThis approach will systematically find the exact number of operations that meet the given criteria.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of 3 elements by iterating through all possible commutative\n    operations and testing each for associativity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let the set be S = {0, 1, 2}.
