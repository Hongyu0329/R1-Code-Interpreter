    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the topological space $X$ and then compute its first homology group.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the space X**: We'll define the space of lattices and show that the \"moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area\" is the quotient space $X = SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n2.  **Relate X to a more familiar space**: We will use the isomorphism of Lie group quotients, $(G/Z)/(H/Z) \\cong G/H$, to show that $X$ is homeomorphic to $X' = PSL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  **Identify X' as a Seifert fibered space**: The space $X'$ is the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $M' = \\mathbb{H} / PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the upper half-plane. This is a classic example of a Seifert fibered space over an orbifold base.\n4.  **Determine the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X')$**: We will use the standard presentation for the fundamental group of a Seifert fibered space. The base orbifold $M'$ is a sphere with one puncture (the cusp) and two cone points of order 2 and 3.\n5.  **Compute the first homology group**: The first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Ab}(\\pi_1(X))$. Since $X \\cong X'$, we compute $\\text{Ab}(\\pi_1(X'))$.\n\nThe python code below will formalize the final step of the calculation, which is the abelianization of the fundamental group based on its presentation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef compute_homology():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the steps to compute H_1(X, Z) and performs the final algebraic calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the space X\")\n    print(\"X is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.\")\n    print(\"A lattice L is defined by a basis, given by the columns of a matrix A in GL(2,R).\")\n    print(\"The area of the lattice is |det(A)|.
