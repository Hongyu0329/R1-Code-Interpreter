    "Of course, I can help you with this task. Here is my plan to find the analytical expression for the solution of the given ODE in the large $x$ regime.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE for Large x:** The given ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$. The initial conditions ($y(0)=0, y'(0)=3, y''(0)=2$) suggest that the solution will grow rapidly. This type of equation often leads to a \"blow-up\" where the solution approaches infinity at a finite value of $x$, let's call it $x_0$. This behavior occurs in a \"large $x$\" regime if we consider $x$ approaching $x_0$.\n2.  **Simplify the ODE:** As $x$ approaches the singularity $x_0$, the terms $y$, $y'$, $y''$, and $y'''$ become very large. In this regime, we can approximate the ODE by balancing the most dominant terms. The terms $\\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2}$ and $\\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$ become negligible compared to the explosive $y^4$ and $(y')^4$ terms. The simplified ODE is thus $y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$.\n3.  **Find the Asymptotic Form:** By analyzing the simplified equation, we can determine the functional form of the solution near the singularity. A careful analysis shows that $(y')^4$ term dominates over the $y^4$ term. By letting $v = y'$, the equation becomes $v'' \\approx v^4$. The solution to this is a power law of the form $v(x) \\approx K(x_0 - x)^{-2/3}$. Integrating this expression for $v(x)$ gives the asymptotic form for $y(x)$:\n    $y(x) \\approx C - A(x_0 - x)^{1/3}$\n4.  **Determine the Constants:**\n    *   The constant $A$ can be determined analytically from the simplified ODE. Its value is $A = 3 \\times (10/9)^{1/3}$.\n    *   The constants $C$ (the value of $y$ at the singularity) and $x_0$ (the location of the singularity) depend on the initial conditions of the specific problem.\n5.  **Numerical Solution:** I will provide a Python script that numerically solves the full ODE from the given initial conditions. The script will find the point of singularity $x_0$ and the value of the solution $C$ at that point.\n6.  **Final Expression:** The script will then substitute the computed values of $A$, $C$, and $x_0$ into the asymptotic formula and print the final analytical expression, with coefficients rounded to two decimal places.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nimport warnings\n\n# Suppress warnings that can occur from tan(t) near its poles\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=RuntimeWarning)\n\ndef get_asymptotic_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the ODE numerically to find the constants for the \n    asymptotic expression and then prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
