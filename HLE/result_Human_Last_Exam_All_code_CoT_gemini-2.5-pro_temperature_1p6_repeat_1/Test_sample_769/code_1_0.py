    Analyzes each employer's situation based on Ontario employment law

    1.  An employer with 25 or more employees on January 1st of a given year
        must have written policies on "disconnecting from work" and "electronic monitoring".
    2.  The compliance status is checked as of January 2, 2023. The critical date for
