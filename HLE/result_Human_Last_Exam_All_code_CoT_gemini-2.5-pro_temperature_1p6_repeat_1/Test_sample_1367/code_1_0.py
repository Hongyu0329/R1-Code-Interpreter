    # Part (a): Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_>=1?
    # For p >= 1 (integer), the level k = -2 + 1/p is an admissible level for sl_2.
    # The vertex algebra V(p) = Ker(Q) is known to be non-simple for these levels.

    # Part (b): Condition for a non-trivial ideal.
    # A VOA ideal is a submodule, so it must be an L_k(sl_2)-module.
    # Furthermore, any such non-trivial submodule contains a singular vector, which generates the ideal.
    # Thus, both conditions are met.

    # Part (c): Does VOA simplicity imply L_k(sl_2)-module irreducibility?
    # Yes. An L_k(sl_2)-submodule of V(p) would generate a proper VOA ideal.
    # If V(p) were reducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module, it could not be simple as a VOA.
