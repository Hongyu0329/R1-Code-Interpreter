    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the character from William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  I will create a Python script to solve this literary question.\n2.  Inside the script, I will create a simple data structure, a list of dictionaries, to represent the key characters and a summary of their significant actions or stories they tell within the book. This simulates a program having \"read\" the text.\n3.  The summary for one of the characters will contain details about visiting a Roman city and describing their origin myth involving a she-wolf and twins, which is a clear reference to Romulus and Remus.\n4.  The script will then iterate through this data, searching for the character whose description contains the keywords \"Roman,\" \"wolf,\" and \"twin.\"\n5.  Once the matching character is found, the script will print their name to the console.\n\n```python\ndef find_character_in_wolfings():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies a character from William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\"\n    based on a specific story they recount.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A data structure representing characters and their notable stories/actions.\n    character_profiles = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Thiodolf\",\n            \"story\": \"The leader of the Wolfing tribe who defends his people against the encroaching Roman army.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hall-Sun\",\n            \"story\": \"The mortal daughter of Thiodolf, known for her love and devotion to her family.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"The Wood-Sun\",\n            \"story\": (\"A demi-goddess and foster-daughter to Thiodolf.
