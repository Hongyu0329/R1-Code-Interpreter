def solve_knot_proportion():
    """
    This function calculates the proportion of hyperbolic knots among all knot types
    with exactly 7 crossings.

    The classification of knots with 7 crossings is well-known in knot theory.
    - Total number of knots with 7 crossings: 7 (named 7_1 to 7_7)
    - A prime knot is either a torus knot or a hyperbolic knot.
    - Among the 7-crossing knots, only 7_1 is a torus knot (specifically, T(2,7)). Torus knots are not hyperbolic.
    - The remaining 6 knots (7_2, 7_3, 7_4, 7_5, 7_6, 7_7) are all hyperbolic.
