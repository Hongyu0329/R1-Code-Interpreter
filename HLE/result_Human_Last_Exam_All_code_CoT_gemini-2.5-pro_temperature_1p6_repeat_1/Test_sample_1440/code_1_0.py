    This function solves the topology problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of equivalence classes
    for a relation '~' on a specific type of topological space X, called a continuum.

    1.  Let X be a continuum (compact connected metric space) with two properties:
        (1) The intersection of any two subcontinua is empty or connected.
        (2) There exist points a, b in X such that X is the only subcontinuum containing both.
        This means X is "irreducible" between a and b.

    2.  The relation is defined as: x ~ y if x and y are contained in some
        nowhere dense subcontinuum of X.

    3.  First, we show there are at least two classes.
        The points a and b from property (2) cannot be in the same class.
        If a ~ b, then there must be a nowhere dense subcontinuum C containing {a,b}.
        But property (2) states the only subcontinuum containing {a,b} is X itself.
        A space X is never nowhere dense in itself. So, C cannot be X.
        This is a contradiction, so a is not equivalent to b (a ~ b is false).
        This means [a] and [b] are distinct equivalence classes.
        So, the number of classes is at least 2.

    4.  Next, we consider the property of transitivity (`x ~ y` and `y ~ z` implies `x ~ z`).
        Let's assume there is a point `x` such that `a ~ x` and `x ~ b`.
        By transitivity, this would imply `a ~ b`.
        But we already proved this is false.
        Therefore, there can be no point `x` that is related to both `a` and `b`.

    5.  This means the space X can be partitioned into three kinds of points:
        - Class [a]: The set of points `x` such that `a ~ x`.
        - Class [b]: The set of points `x` such that `b ~ x`.
        - A third set M: The set of points `x` such that `x` is not related to `a` and not related to `b`.

    6.  The set M cannot be empty. If it were, X would be the disjoint union of [a] and [b].
        This would imply X is not connected (a contradiction, as X is a continuum).
        So, there must be at least one point in M, which belongs to a third class.
        Thus, there must be at least 3 equivalence classes.

    7.  It is possible to construct such a space X where this minimum is achieved:
        one class for points 'near' a, one for points 'near' b, and one for all
        points in the 'middle'. Therefore, the smallest possible number of classes is 3.
