    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will identify the key elements from the user's query to find the correct physicist.\n\n1.  **Physicist's Field:** Microscopy.\n2.  **Discovery:** An optical effect in real imagery.\n3.  **Anecdote:** Discovered after an observation by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\n\nThese clues point to the story of Erwin Wilhelm M端ller. A cleaning lady was dusting a concave shaving mirror and noticed that the dust particles were being projected as a magnified real image on the opposite wall. M端ller recognized the significance of this phenomenon, which led to his invention of the field-emission microscope, a device capable of imaging surfaces at near-atomic resolution.\n\nI will provide a Python script to print this name.\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the physicist who fits the description.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The physicist known for microscopy (Field Ion Microscope, Atom Probe)\n    # who was inspired by a custodial worker's observation with a concave mirror.\n    physicist_name = \"Erwin Wilhelm M端ller\"\n    print(physicist_name)\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Erwin Wilhelm M端ller>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
