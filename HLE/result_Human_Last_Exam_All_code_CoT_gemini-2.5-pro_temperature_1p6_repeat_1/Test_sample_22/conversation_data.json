    "SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the theoretical upper limit of phenotypic variance that can be explained by a perfect linear model of all common SNPs. It is an estimate of the total contribution of these genetic markers to a trait's variation within a population.\n\nA Polygenic Score (PGS), on the other hand, is a practical tool. It's a predictive model built from a real-world Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), which has a finite sample size. The predictive ability of the PGS (often measured by R²) is limited by several factors:\n1.  **Imperfect Effect Size Estimates:** GWAS discovery samples are finite, leading to statistical noise and errors in the estimated effect of each SNP.\n2.  **Incomplete LD Information:** The model may not perfectly account for the complex correlation structure between all SNPs.\n3.  **Methodological Limitations:** The specific algorithm used to build the PGS (e.g., clumping and thresholding, LDPred) is not perfect.\n4.  **Population Differences:** The PGS may perform worse in a target population that is genetically distant from the GWAS discovery population.\n\nBecause a PGS is an imperfect, real-world implementation attempting to capture the signal defined by the theoretical SNP heritability, its predictive power will necessarily be lower than that theoretical maximum. The SNP heritability is the ceiling, and the PGS R² is the actual achieved performance, which will always be below that ceiling.\n\nThe following Python code conceptually illustrates this relationship. We define a theoretical maximum (SNP heritability) and then apply several \"loss factors\" that represent the real-world limitations in building a PGS to calculate the achievable PGS R-squared.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Main logic of the script ---\n\n# 1. Define SNP heritability (h²_SNP).\n# This is the theoretical maximum proportion of phenotypic variance\n# that can be explained by all SNPs, assuming a perfect model.\n# Let's say for a trait, it's 40%.\nsnp_heritability = 0.40\n\n# 2. Define real-world limiting factors for a Polygenic Score (PGS).\n# The performance of a real PGS is always less than the theoretical maximum\n# due to practical limitations.\n\n# Factor A: Finite GWAS sample size leads to imperfect SNP effect estimates.\n# Let's model this as capturing only 75% of the true signal.\neffect_size_accuracy = 0.75\n\n# Factor B: The PGS model itself has methodological imperfections.\n# (e.g., choice of SNPs, handling of correlations (LD)).\n# Let's model this as a 90% efficiency.\nmethodological_efficiency = 0.90\n\n# 3. Calculate the actual predictive ability of the PGS (R-squared).\n# It's the theoretical maximum reduced by the real-world loss factors.\npgs_r_squared = snp_heritability * effect_size_accuracy * methodological_efficiency\n\n# 4. Print the comparison.\nprint(f\"SNP Heritability (Theoretical Maximum Variance Explained): {snp_heritability}\")\nprint(f\"PGS R-squared (Actual Variance Explained by the model): {pgs_r_squared}\")\nprint(\"\\n# --- Comparison --- #\")\nis_lower = pgs_r_squared < snp_heritability\nprint(f\"Is the PGS predictive ability ({pgs_r_squared:.3f}) lower than SNP heritability ({snp_heritability:.3f})? {is_lower}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis demonstrates that the variance explained by a polygenic score is lower than the total SNP heritability for the phenotype.\")\n\n# --- End of main logic ---\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the output to the user\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<True>>>"
