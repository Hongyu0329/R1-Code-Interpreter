    # 2. Mechanism from Knockdown: Knocking down the GABA transporter Slc6a11 (-0.37 mV)
    #    phenocopies the alcohol-preferring state (-0.38 mV). This implies the mechanism is related
    #    to reduced GABA transport.
    #    Reduced GABA transport -> Higher extracellular GABA -> Increased tonic inhibition.

    # 3. Therapeutic Hypothesis: The increased tonic inhibition leads to a paradoxical *increase* in
    #    net neuronal activity (disinhibition). To reverse this, blocking the effect of excess
    #    GABA with an antagonist is a more logical approach than enhancing it with an agonist.
