# A program to determine the source of Dilp2 for neural stem cell reactivation.

# --- Step 1: Define the experimental evidence from the text as facts ---

# Fact 1: A specific experiment was performed to isolate the role of hemolymph Dilp2.
# A Dilp2-binding protein, Imp-L2, was overexpressed in the fat body.
# The fat body secretes proteins into the hemolymph.
# This "soaks up" Dilp2 specifically in the hemolymph.
experiment = "Overexpress Imp-L2 in the fat body"
target_of_experiment = "Dilp2 in the hemolymph"

# Fact 2: The result of this specific experiment.
# When hemolymph Dilp2 was soaked up, neural stem cells failed to reactivate.
result_of_experiment = "Neural stem cells fail to reactivate"
is_hemolymph_dilp2_necessary = True

# Fact 3: Defining the two potential pathways for Dilp2 action.
pathway_A = "Dilp2 transported directly to DRNs via neurons"
pathway_B = "Dilp2 secreted to the hemolymph and crossing the blood-brain barrier"

# --- Step 2: Evaluate the hypotheses based on the evidence ---

print(f"This experiment specifically removes or neutralizes Dilp2 in the hemolymph.")
print("If Pathway A were the source of Dilp2 for reactivation, the signal would travel neuron-to-neuron, bypassing the hemolymph.")
print("Therefore, removing hemolymph Dilp2 should NOT affect reactivation.")
print(f"However, the observed result was: '{result_of_experiment}'.")
print("This contradicts the prediction for Pathway A. Therefore, the neuronal pathway is not the source of the activating Dilp2 signal.")
print("-" * 60)

# Evaluate Pathway B
print("Evaluating Pathway B (hemolymph transport)...")
print(f"The same critical experiment is considered: '{experiment}'.")
print(f"If Pathway B were the source, the Dilp2 signal must travel through the hemolymph to reach the brain.")
print("Therefore, removing hemolymph Dilp2 SHOULD block reactivation.")
print(f"The observed result was: '{result_of_experiment}'.")
print(f"This result perfectly matches the prediction for Pathway B. The evidence shows that Dilp2 in the hemolymph is necessary for reactivation.")
print("-" * 60)

# --- Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis ---
print("Conclusion:")
print("The experiment where Dilp2 is removed from the hemolymph is sufficient to block neural stem cell reactivation.")
print("This demonstrates that the hemolymph pool of Dilp2 is the essential source driving this process.")
