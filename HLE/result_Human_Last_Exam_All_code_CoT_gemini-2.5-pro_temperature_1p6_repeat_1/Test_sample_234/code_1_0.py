# The user wants to know the number of properties that must always be true.
# Based on the mathematical reasoning above, the properties are:
# 1. Open: True
# 2. Closed: False
# 3. Connected: False
# 4. Compact: False
# 5. Dense: True
# 6. Connected complement: False
# 7. Trivial first singular homology group: True
# The number of properties that are always true is 3.

# This is a thinking process which is not a task for coding.
# I will simply print the number.
