    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$. A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi_p$ modulo the prime power factors of $d$.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct primes (it is square-free), a character $\\chi$ mod $d$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_p$ is primitive. For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (which has order 1).\n\n**2. Order of the Character**\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We need this lcm to be 6.\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\nFor this to hold:\n*   The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n*   Since $\\chi_p$ must be primitive, its order must be greater than 1. So, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   At least one component must have an order divisible by 2 (i.e., 2 or 6).\n*   At least one component must have an order divisible by 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\n**3. Counting Component Characters**\nThe number of characters modulo a prime $p$ of a given order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $\\phi(p) = p-1$. All non-principal characters are primitive.\nLet's check this condition for our primes and the required orders {2, 3, 6}:\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1=6$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are all divisors of 6.\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1=12$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are all divisors of 12.\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1=18$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are all divisors of 18.\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1=30$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are all divisors of 30.\n\nSo, for each prime factor $p$, we can find the number of available primitive characters for each required order:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $N_2 = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $N_3 = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $N_6 = \\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four prime factors, the number of available primitive characters with an order that divides 6 is $N_2+N_3+N_6 = 1+2+2=5$.\n\n**4. The Final Calculation**\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We start with the total number of ways to choose four primitive component characters whose orders are all in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, and then subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6.\n\n*   Total combinations of component characters with orders in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$: There are 4 components, and for each, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices. Total = $5^4 = 625$.\n*   Subtract cases where the lcm is a divisor of 2 (i.e., all orders are 2). There is $N_2=1$ choice for each of the 4 components. Total = $1^4 = 1$.\n*   Subtract cases where the lcm is a divisor of 3 (i.e., all orders are 3). There are $N_3=2$ choices for each of the 4 components. Total = $2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe final number of primitive characters of order 6 is $5^4 - 1^4 - 2^4 = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nThe following python code automates this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\n# Main part of the script\nd = 53599\nk = 6\n\nprint(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d={d} and order k={k}.\")\n\n# Step 1: Factorize d and verify conditions\nfactors = get_prime_factorization(d)\nprime_factors = list(factors.keys())\nprint(f\"The conductor d is {d}, with prime factorization: {' * '.join(map(str, prime_factors))}.\")\nnum_factors = len(prime_factors)\nprint(f\"Since d is square-free, a character is primitive if and only if all its {num_factors} component characters are non-principal (order > 1).\")\n\n# Step 2: Count available characters for each component\nprint(f\"The order of the character is the lcm of component orders.
