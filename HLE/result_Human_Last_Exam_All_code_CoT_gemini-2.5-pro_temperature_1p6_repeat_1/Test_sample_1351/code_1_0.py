    Solves the given group theory problem and prints the answers.
    
    The solution is based on the following reasoning:
    
    1.  The parameters are d=5, q=4, e1=3, e2=2.
    2.  For g1, dim(U1) = e1 = 3, so dim(F1) = d - e1 = 2.
    3.  For g2, dim(U2) = e2 = 2, so dim(F2) = d - e2 = 3.
    4.  Scott's Lemma states that if the sum of dimensions of fixed-point spaces is
        at least the dimension of the vector space, the group generated by these elements
        must have a common fixed vector.
    5.  Here, dim(F1) + dim(F2) = 2 + 3 = 5, which is equal to d=5.
    6.  Therefore, for any pair (g1, g2) with these properties, F1 ∩ F2 is non-trivial.
    7.  A non-trivial intersection F1 ∩ F2 implies the existence of a common eigenvector
        for g1 and g2 with eigenvalue 1. The span of this vector is a 1-dimensional
        invariant subspace for the group <g1, g2>, making the group reducible.

    This leads to the following answers:
    (a) No, the pair is never irreducible.
    (b) The cause is always (1) F1 ∩ F2 != {0}. We show that (2) and (3) are impossible
        for a stingray duo if (1) holds.
    (c) The number of irreducible pairs is 0, so the proportion is 0.
