# Define the variables and the condition for divergence.
# The analysis shows that the L^p integral of I(a) diverges if p is less than or equal to a critical value.
# This critical value is determined by the slowest decay rate of I(a).
# The slowest decay rate is alpha = 1/3, found for terms like a_6 * x^3.
# The integral over a "tube" in the direction of a_6 behaves like M^(1 - p/3), where M is the magnitude of a_6.
# This diverges if the exponent is non-negative.
# 1 - p/3 >= 0

p = sp.Symbol('p')
inequality = sp.S(1) - p/3 >= 0

# Solve the inequality for p
solution = sp.solve(inequality, p)

# The result gives the range of p for which the function is not in L^p.
# The question asks for the largest such p.
critical_p = solution.rhs
