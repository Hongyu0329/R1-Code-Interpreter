    print(f"3. The tower is maximal: there is no uncountable subset y ⊆ {omega_1} such that y ⊆* x_α for all α < {delta}.")

    print(f"\nFirst, let's assume {delta} is a finite number, say n.")
    print(f"The tower would be <x_0, x_1, ..., x_{{n-1}}>.")
    print("Consider the set y = x_0 ∩ x_1 ∩ ... ∩ x_{n-1}.")

    print(f"then since A is uncountable, A \\ B would have to be uncountable. But A \\ B and B \\ A are disjoint subsets of A ∪ B,")
    print(f"and more importantly, for our tower `x_1 = (x_1 ∩ x_0) ∪ (x_1 \\ x_0)`. Since |x_1|={aleph_1} and |x_1 \\ x_0| is countable, |x_1 ∩ x_0| must be {aleph_1}.")
    print(f"By induction, y is uncountable.")
    print(f"Now, let's check if y is a pseudo-intersection. For any i < n, we have y ⊆ x_i, which implies y \\ x_i = ∅.")
    print(f"The size of the empty set is 0, which is countable. So, y ⊆* x_i for all i < n.")
