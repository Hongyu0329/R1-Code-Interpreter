    """
    Solves the ring isomorphism classification problem.

    Based on the analysis of the properties of each ring:
    - Rings A and B are isomorphic coordinate rings of the same elliptic curve.
    - Rings C and L are both isomorphic to the product ring F_7 x F_7.
    - Rings D and H are both isomorphic to the zero ring {0}.
    - Rings E and K are both isomorphic to the finite field F_49.
    - Rings F and G are both isomorphic to the ring F_7[x]/(x^2), which has nilpotent elements.
    - Ring I is the coordinate ring of an elliptic curve not isomorphic to the one for A and B.
    - Ring J is a discrete valuation ring, which is unique in the list.

    The isomorphism classes are formed and then sorted alphabetically.
