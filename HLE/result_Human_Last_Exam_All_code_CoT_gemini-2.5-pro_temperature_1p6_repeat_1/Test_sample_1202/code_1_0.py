        'C': "Plausible, but perhaps not the most likely. In neofunctionalization, one copy gains a novel function. This explains both retention and divergence, but relies on relatively rare beneficial gain-of-function mutations.",
        'D': "Most Likely. In subfunctionalization, the two copies partition the ancestral functions between them. Both copies are now required, ensuring their retention. This process only requires common loss-of-function mutations, making it a very likely mechanism for preserving duplicate genes immediately after duplication.",

However, Subfunctionalization (D) is often considered the 'most likely' mechanism because it provides a more passive and probable pathway. It relies on common loss-of-function mutations to partition ancestral roles, while neofunctionalization requires rarer gain-of-function mutations to create a new role. Therefore, subfunctionalization is a highly probable route for preventing a new duplicate from being immediately lost.")
