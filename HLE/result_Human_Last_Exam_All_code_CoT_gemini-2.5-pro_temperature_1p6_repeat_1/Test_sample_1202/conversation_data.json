    "Here is my plan to arrive at the correct answer. I will analyze the potential fates of a duplicated gene and evaluate each of the given mechanisms against the criteria of promoting both the retention (keeping the gene in the genome) and divergence (the gene sequences changing over time) of the duplicates.\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Problem:** After a gene duplication event, the genome has two identical copies of a gene. This redundancy means there's less selective pressure to maintain the second copy, which will often be lost or become a non-functional \"pseudogene\". The question asks for the mechanism that best explains how *both* copies are kept (retained) and become different from each other (diverge).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy's sequence is replaced by the sequence of the other copy. This process actively works *against* divergence by making the genes more similar. So, it's incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate, where one copy accumulates mutations that make it non-functional. While this represents divergence, it's a mechanism of gene *loss*, not retention of two functional genes.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy maintains the original function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. The new function provides a strong reason to *retain* the gene, and the process of gaining that new function causes it to *diverge*. This is a valid mechanism.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the original ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple tissues. After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that disable different sub-functions. As a result, both genes are now required to perform the full set of original functions. This necessity drives their *retention*, and the complementary loss of functions causes them to *diverge*. This is also a valid mechanism.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This describes the rapid evolution of many new species from a common ancestor. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material for this process, it is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a specific molecular mechanism for retaining a single gene pair.\n\n3.  **Compare Valid Mechanisms (C vs. D):** Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the subfunctionalization model is often considered \"most likely\" to explain the initial preservation of the duplicate. This is because it only requires relatively common loss-of-function mutations to occur in different parts of the two gene copies, which \"locks\" them both into the genome. Neofunctionalization, by contrast, requires a rarer gain-of-function mutation to occur before the second copy is lost to pseudogenization. Therefore, subfunctionalization is seen as a more common and passive route to retention.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    analysis = {\n        'A': \"Incorrect.
