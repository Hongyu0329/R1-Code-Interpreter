    A) Given a connected graph H, consider X = {G graph: H not a subgraph of G} with G1 <= G2 if G1 is a subgraph of G2.
       Answer: N (No). For any H, one can construct an infinite ascending chain of H-free graphs. For example, if H is not a path, P_n (path on n vertices) for n=1,2,3... is an infinite chain.
    
    B) Given a finite, discrete set S in R, consider X=S with <= from R.
       Answer: Y (Yes). Any non-empty finite subset of R has a maximum element.
    
    C) Given a countable, discrete set S in R, consider X=S with <= from R.
       Answer: D (Depends). S={-n | n in N} has a maximum 0. S={1-1/n | n in N} has no maximum.
    
    D) Given an uncountable, discrete set S in R, consider X=S with <= from R.
       Answer: Y (Yes). There are no uncountable discrete sets in R. The class is empty, so the condition is vacuously true.
       
    E) X = {sequences of natural numbers} with (a_n) <= (b_n) if (b_n) is a subsequence of (a_n).
       Answer: Y (Yes). A constant sequence m = (c, c, c, ...) is maximal. Any subsequence of m is m itself. So if m <= x, x must be m, and then x <= m holds.
       
    F) X = {sequences of natural numbers} with (a_n) <= (b_n) if (a_n) is a subsequence of (b_n).
       Answer: N (No). For any sequence m, we can construct x that properly contains m as a subsequence (e.g., x = (m1, m1, m2, m2,...)), which prevents m from being maximal. No maximal element exists.
