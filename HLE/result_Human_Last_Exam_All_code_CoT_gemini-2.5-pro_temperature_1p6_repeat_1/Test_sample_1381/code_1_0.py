def calculate_max_equilibria(N):

    Calculates the maximum possible number of equilibria for a generalized
    Lotka-Volterra system with N species.

    The analysis shows that for certain parameter choices, the system can have up to 2^N equilibria.
    This occurs when the interaction terms effectively vanish, leading to independent
    logistic growth for each species. Each species then has two equilibrium states (0 or its
    carrying capacity K_i), leading to 2^N combinations for the N-species system.
