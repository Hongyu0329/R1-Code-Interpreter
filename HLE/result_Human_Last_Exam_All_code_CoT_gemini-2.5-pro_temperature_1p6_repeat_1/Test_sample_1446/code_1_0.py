# The critical exponent nu is dependent on the spatial dimension 'd' and the
# universality class. We assume the most common non-trivial case:
# the 3D Ising model universality class, described by a G4 (phi-4) theory.

# Define the context for the calculation
dimension = 3
universality_class = "G_4 (Ising)"
critical_exponent_symbol = "Î½"

# The precise value for the critical exponent nu for the 3D Ising universality
# class has been determined with high accuracy. We use a value from
# modern conformal bootstrap results.
critical_exponent_value = 0.629971

# Formulate and print the final statement as an equation.
# This fulfills the instruction to output each number involved.
