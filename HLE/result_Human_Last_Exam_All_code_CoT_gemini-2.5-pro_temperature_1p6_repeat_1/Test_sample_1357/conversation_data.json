    "This is a fascinating question that connects algebraic geometry with number theory and combinatorics.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Translate the Geometry:** I will first explain the mathematical background. The problem is about finding the number of possible \"stable reduction\" forms for a genus 4 curve when its Jacobian variety has \"good reduction\". A key theorem in this area states that for a curve of genus `g` whose Jacobian has good reduction, the special fiber of its stable model is a nodal curve whose irreducible components are smooth and whose dual graph is a tree.\n2.  **Convert to a Combinatorial Problem:** This geometric condition means that the genus `g` of the original curve is simply the sum of the genera of the smooth components of its stable reduction. For example, a genus 4 curve could reduce to two genus 2 curves attached at a point, or a genus 3 curve and a genus 1 curve attached at a point. Each distinct combination of component genera corresponds to a unique type of stable reduction.\n3.  **The Partition Function:** This problem is therefore equivalent to asking: \"In how many ways can the integer 4 be written as a sum of positive integers?\" This is precisely the definition of the partition function `p(g)`, in this case `p(4)`.\n4.  **Write Python Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Finds all the partitions of the integer 4.\n    *   Prints each partition, representing a specific type of stable reduction.\n    *   Counts the total number of partitions to get the final answer.\n    *   Outputs the result in a clear, equation-like format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_and_count_partitions(g):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the number of partitions of an integer g.\n    This corresponds to the number of stable reduction types for a genus g curve\n    with a good reduction Jacobian.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We use a recursive helper function to find the partitions\n    partitions_list = []\n    def find_partitions_recursive(target, max_val, current_partition):\n        if target == 0:\n            partitions_list.append(list(current_partition))\n            return\n        \n        for i in range(min(max_val, target), 0, -1):\n            current_partition.append(i)\n            find_partitions_recursive(target - i, i, current_partition)\n            current_partition.pop()\n\n    find_partitions_recursive(g, g, [])\n\n    print(f\"The problem reduces to finding the number of partitions of the genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"Each partition represents a distinct type of stable reduction, where the numbers in the partition are the genera of the smooth components.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Print each partition\n    print(\"The possible partitions of the genus are:\")\n    for p in partitions_list:\n        print(f\"  {p}\")\n    \n    # Print the final calculation as a sum\n    count = len(partitions_list)\n    sum_string = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * count)\n    print(\"\\nCounting these types gives the total number:\")\n    print(f\"Total = {sum_string} = {count}\")\n    \n# The genus of the curve is 4\ngenus = 4\nfind_and_count_partitions(genus)\n```\n<<<5>>>"
