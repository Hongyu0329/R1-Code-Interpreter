def solve():
    """
    This function implements the solution based on the mathematical derivation.
    It finds the lexicographically least tuple (a_1, b_1, ..., a_l, b_l)
    with l minimal, such that no M(a_i,b_i) is full, yet their
    connect-sum is full.

    The derivation leads to the following conclusions:
    1. Minimal number of manifolds is l=3.
    2. The equation to satisfy is Sum_{i=1 to 3} (1-a_i)*(1-b_i) = 1.
    3. The lexicographically smallest set of pairs (a_i, b_i) satisfying
       the conditions a_i, b_i != 1 is {(0,0), (0,0), (0,2)}.

    This code verifies this solution and prints the final tuple.
