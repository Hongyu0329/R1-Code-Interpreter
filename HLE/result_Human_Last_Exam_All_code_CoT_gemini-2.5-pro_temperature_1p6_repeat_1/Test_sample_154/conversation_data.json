    "To solve this problem, we need to count how many distinct graph structures (non-isomorphic) with 5 vertices are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is **2-vertex-connected** (or biconnected) if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no \"articulation points\" or \"cut vertices\".\n\nThe number of vertices is small (5), which makes it feasible to solve this computationally. We will use the Python library `networkx`, which is a powerful tool for graph analysis.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  We will use the `networkx` graph atlas, which contains a pre-computed list of all simple non-isomorphic graphs with up to 7 vertices.\n2.  We will iterate through this list of graphs.\n3.  For each graph, we'll check if it has exactly 5 vertices.\n4.  If it does, we will check if it is 2-vertex-connected. The `networkx.node_connectivity()` function is perfect for this; a graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is 2 or greater.\n5.  We will maintain a counter, incrementing it for each graph that meets all the criteria.\n6.  Finally, we will print the total count.\n\nThis approach automates the process of checking each of the 34 possible non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices for the desired property.\n\nIf you do not have `networkx` installed, you can install it by running: `pip install networkx`\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic\n    graphs with 5 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a counter for the graphs that meet the criteria.\n    biconnected_count = 0\n\n    # The graph_atlas_g() function provides a list of all non-isomorphic\n    # simple graphs with up to 7 vertices.\n    all_small_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # Iterate through all the graphs in the atlas.\n    for G in all_small_graphs:\n        # We are only interested in graphs with exactly 5 vertices.\n        if G.number_of_nodes() == 5:\n            # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is >= 2.\n            # By definition, a graph must have at least k+1 vertices to be\n            # k-connected. networkx.node_connectivity correctly handles\n            # disconnected graphs (returns 0) and graphs with cut vertices (returns 1).\n            if nx.node_connectivity(G) >= 2:\n                biconnected_count += 1\n\n    # The number we counted is the final answer.\n    final_count = biconnected_count\n    \n    print(f\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is: {final_count}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<6>>>\n```"
