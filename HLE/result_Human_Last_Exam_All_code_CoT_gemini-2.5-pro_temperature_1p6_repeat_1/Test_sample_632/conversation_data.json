    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will research the history of the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome, focusing on significant changes made to the square's architecture or infrastructure around the year 1950. I will specifically look for features that were removed by the city administration during that time. Once I have identified the correct feature, I will write a Python script to present the answer, as you've requested.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know about a unique feature that was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.\n# Based on historical records of Rome's urban development, the feature in question relates to the city's public transportation system.\n\n# In the first half of the 20th century, a network of tram lines ran through many of Rome's historic centers, including the Piazza della Rotonda.\n# These tracks and the associated overhead electrical lines were a prominent, if not always beloved, feature of the square.\n# Around 1950, as part of a city-wide move to modernize and reduce congestion, the tram lines passing in front of the Pantheon were dismantled and the service was discontinued.\n\nfeature_removed = \"The tram tracks\"\n\nprint(\"The unique architectural feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda by the city administration around 1950 was:\")\nprint(feature_removed)\n```\n<<<The tram tracks>>>"
