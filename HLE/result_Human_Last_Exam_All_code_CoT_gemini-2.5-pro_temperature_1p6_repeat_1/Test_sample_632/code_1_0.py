# The user wants to know about a unique feature that was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.
# Based on historical records of Rome's urban development, the feature in question relates to the city's public transportation system.

# In the first half of the 20th century, a network of tram lines ran through many of Rome's historic centers, including the Piazza della Rotonda.
# These tracks and the associated overhead electrical lines were a prominent, if not always beloved, feature of the square.
# Around 1950, as part of a city-wide move to modernize and reduce congestion, the tram lines passing in front of the Pantheon were dismantled and the service was discontinued.
