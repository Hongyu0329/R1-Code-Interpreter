    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the current common name for the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)* and the year this common name was coined. The native range is North America.\n2.  **Determine the Common Name:** The genus *Perdita* is a large group of very small bees found primarily in the arid regions of North and Central America. A search of entomological resources like BugGuide.net, the Xerces Society, and popular guides such as \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" consistently reveals that the most widely used common name for this genus is **Fairy bees**. This name likely refers to their diminutive size and often iridescent coloration.\n3.  **Determine the Year of Coining:** This is the more challenging part, as common names often arise organically and may not have a single, formal \"coining\" event like scientific names. The strategy is to find the earliest known documented use of the name in a publication.\n    *   **Establish a baseline:** Key, comprehensive bee guides from the 1990s, such as \"The Bee Genera of North and Central America\" (Michener, McGinley, and Danforth, 1994), do not use the term \"Fairy bees.\" This strongly suggests the name gained currency in the 21st century.\n    *   **Search for early 21st-century usage:**\n        *   A 2006 newsletter (\"Bee Musing,\" No. 3, Fall 2006) by renowned melittologist Laurence Packer states that *Perdita* are \"sometimes called 'fairy bees'\". This is a verifiable, dated reference, but the phrasing \"sometimes called\" indicates the name was already in circulation and not being coined at that moment.\n        *   This points to an origin prior to 2006.\n        *   Further investigation points to a 2004 publication: a CD-ROM titled **\"The Bees of the Colorado Plateau\"** by T. L. Griswold, F. D. Parker, and J. C. Collett. Dr. Terry Griswold is a leading expert on bees of this region, where *Perdita* are extremely common. A user-friendly digital key like this is a very logical place for a descriptive common name to be introduced to the entomological community.\n    *   **Conclusion on Year:** Given that the name was not in major literature in 1994 but was described as already being in some use by 2006, the 2004 publication by a key expert in the field stands as the most plausible and earliest documented introduction, or \"coining,\" of the name.\n\n**Final Answer Assembly:**\n*   **Name:** Fairy bees\n*   **Year:** 2004\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 2004>>>"
