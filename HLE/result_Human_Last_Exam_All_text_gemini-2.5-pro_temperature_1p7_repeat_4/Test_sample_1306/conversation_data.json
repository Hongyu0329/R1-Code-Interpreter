    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Algebra:** We are working with the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, which is a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   **Parameter q:** The parameter $q$ is a primitive third root of unity, for example, $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$. In the general theory, this corresponds to setting $l=3$. The fact that $q$ is a root of unity is crucial, as it makes the representation theory non-semisimple and much richer than the case where $q$ is not a root of unity.\n*   **Category C:** This is the category whose objects are all *indecomposable* and *finite-dimensional* representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. A representation is indecomposable if it cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-trivial subrepresentations.\n*   **The Question:** We need to determine what percentage of the objects in this category $C$ are *irreducible* (or *simple*). An irreducible representation is one with no non-trivial proper subrepresentations. Every irreducible representation is indecomposable, but the converse is not true in this context.\n\n**Step 2: Careful Points and Interpretation**\n\nA major point of consideration is that the category $C$ contains infinitely many non-isomorphic objects. The classification of these objects is quite complex and depends on the action of the center of the algebra.\nThe center of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is large and contains the elements $E^3, F^3, K^3$. On any indecomposable representation, these central elements must act as a scalar up to nilpotency. This allows the category $C$ to be broken down into \"blocks\" based on these scalar values (the central character).\n\n*   **Generic Blocks:** For most choices of central characters (specifically, where $E^3$ and $F^3$ act invertibly), the resulting block is semisimple. In these blocks, every indecomposable object is irreducible. Thus, for these blocks, the percentage is 100%.\n*   **Singular Blocks:** For specific choices of central characters (e.g., where $E^3$ or $F^3$ acts as zero), the category is not semisimple.\n    *   **Nilpotent Block:** The most special case is the \"principal block\" where $E^3, F^3,$ and $K^3-1$ all act as zero. This block contains only a finite number of irreducible objects (2 for $l=3$) but an infinite number of indecomposable objects. For this block, the percentage of irreducible objects is 0%.\n    *   **Cyclic Blocks:** These are cases where one of $E^3$ or $F^3$ acts as zero, but not both. These blocks have a finite number of indecomposable objects. For $l=3$, each such block has 3 irreducible objects and 3 reducible indecomposable objects, giving a percentage of 50%.\n\nSince the objects of $C$ are infinite and are organized into families with different properties, the phrase \"what percentage of the objects\" is ambiguous. A literal interpretation is ill-posed. Therefore, we must infer the intended meaning, which is common in advanced mathematical problems. A standard interpretation is to consider a specific, finite, and fundamental family of representations that captures the essential nature of the theory at this root of unity.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Intended Set of Objects**\n\nThe most natural and fundamental set of representations to consider are the standard highest-weight modules $V(n)$ for small values of $n$. Specifically, the modules $\\{V(n) | 0 \\le n \\le l-1\\}$ are fundamental as their dimensions are at most $l$. For our case where $l=3$, this set is $\\{V(0), V(1), V(2)\\}$. These are all known to be indecomposable.\n\nWe will proceed under the well-justified assumption that the question is asking for the percentage of irreducible modules within this specific set.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Objects in the Set $\\{V(0), V(1), V(2)\\}$}\n\nA central result in the representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive $l$-th root of unity states:\nThe standard representation $V(n)$ (of dimension $n+1$) is irreducible if and only if $l$ does not divide $n+1$.\n\nLet's apply this criterion to our set of objects for $l=3$:\n1.  **Object V(0):** Here $n=0$. We check if $l=3$ divides $n+1=1$. It does not. Therefore, $V(0)$ is irreducible.\n2.  **Object V(1):** Here $n=1$. We check if $l=3$ divides $n+1=2$. It does not. Therefore, $V(1)$ is irreducible.\n3.  **Object V(2):** Here $n=2$. We check if $l=3$ divides $n+1=3$. It does. Therefore, $V(2)$ is reducible. (It is, however, still indecomposable).\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Final Percentage**\n\nWe have analyzed the set of fundamental objects $\\{V(0), V(1), V(2)\\}$, which we assume represents the scope of the question.\n*   Total number of objects in the set: 3\n*   Number of irreducible objects in the set: 2 ($V(0)$ and $V(1)$)\n\nThe fraction of irreducible objects is $2/3$. To express this as a percentage, we calculate:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 100\\% = 66.666...\\% $$\nRounding to one decimal place, we get 66.7%.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis hinges on interpreting the question as referring to the fundamental representations $\\{V(0), V(1), V(2)\\}$. Within this set of three indecomposable representations, two of them ($V(0)$ and $V(1)$) are irreducible, while one ($V(2)$) is not. This yields a percentage of $(2/3) \\times 100\\%$.\n\n<<<66.7>>>"
