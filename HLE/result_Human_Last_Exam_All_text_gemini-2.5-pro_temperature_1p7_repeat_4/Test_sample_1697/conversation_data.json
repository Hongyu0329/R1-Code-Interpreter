    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   This is an aromatic compound derived from benzene.\n    *   The \"benzamide\" part indicates a benzene ring attached to an amide functional group, -C(=O)N-.\n    *   \"N,N-diethyl-\" means two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. So, the group is -C(=O)N(Et)₂. This group is at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n    *   \"-3-dimethylamino\" means a dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n    *   The structure has protons on the aromatic ring at positions 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n           C(=O)N(Et)₂\n          /\n      ---C1---C2(H)---\n     /       \\\n    C6(H)     C3---N(CH₃)₂\n     \\       /\n      ---C5(H)---C4(H)---\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagents for the First Step:**\n    *   `sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium)`: A very strong organometallic base. Its primary role is to remove a proton (deprotonation).\n    *   `TMEDA (Tetramethylethylenediamine)`: A chelating agent for lithium ions (Li⁺). It breaks down the aggregates of sec-BuLi, increasing its basicity and reactivity. It also helps to direct the deprotonation by coordinating with the lithium atom of the intermediate.\n    *   `THF (Tetrahydrofuran)`: A common polar aprotic solvent for organometallic reactions.\n\n*   **Reagent for the Second Step:**\n    *   `CH₃I (Methyl iodide)`: An electrophilic source of a methyl group. It is used to add a methyl group to a nucleophile.\n\n**Step 2: The First Reaction - Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)**\n\nThe combination of a substituted benzene ring with a strong base like sec-BuLi/TMEDA strongly suggests a Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM) reaction. In this reaction, a substituent on the ring directs the deprotonation to an adjacent (ortho) position.\n\n*   **Identifying Directing Groups:** The starting material has two potential directing groups (DMGs):\n    1.  The **N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂)** at C1. The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base and coordinates strongly to the lithium ion.\n    2.  The **dimethylamino group (-NMe₂)** at C3. The nitrogen lone pair can also coordinate to the lithium ion.\n\n*   **Comparing Directing Group Strength:** The amide group is one of the most powerful directing groups for ortho-metalation, significantly stronger than the amino group. The general trend for directing ability is: -CONR₂ > -NR₂.\n\n*   **Determining the Site of Deprotonation:**\n    *   The primary directing group, **-CONEt₂**, will direct deprotonation to its ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n    *   The secondary directing group, **-NMe₂**, will direct deprotonation to its ortho positions: C2 and C4.\n    *   The C2 position is ortho to *both* directing groups. This is known as a **cooperative effect**. The proton at C2 is significantly more acidic than any other proton on the ring because deprotonation at this site is favored by both substituents.\n    *   The strong base, sec-BuLi, will selectively remove the most acidic proton, which is the one at the C2 position.\n    *   This forms a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate. The lithium atom at C2 is stabilized by chelation, forming a stable six-membered ring with the carbonyl oxygen of the amide and the nitrogen of the dimethylamino group.\n\n    The intermediate is:\n    ```\n           (Li)\n             |\n           C2-------C1-C(=O)N(Et)₂\n          /        |\n      C3-N(Me)₂    C6\n      |          |\n      C4---------C5\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: The Second Reaction - Electrophilic Quench**\n\n*   The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a powerful nucleophile (a carbanion at C2).\n*   This nucleophile is then reacted with methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n*   The nucleophilic carbon at C2 attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I in an S_N2-like reaction, displacing the iodide ion (I⁻).\n*   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group.\n\n**Step 4: The Final Product**\n\nThe starting molecule, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, is methylated at the C2 position.\n\nThe structure of the final product is:\n```\n       CH₃\n        |\n      ---C2-------C1---C(=O)N(Et)₂\n     /         \\\n C3---N(CH₃)₂    C6(H)\n |           /\n C4(H)-----C5(H)\n```\n\nThe name of this compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
