The inner product is equal to twice the Euclidean action for the field configuration $\phi$. Mathematically, this is expressed as: $(\phi, D_\phi) = 2 S_E[\phi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \left( (\partial_\tau \phi)^2 + (\nabla \phi)^2 + m^2 \phi^2 \right)$, where the operator is $D_\phi = -\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2$.
