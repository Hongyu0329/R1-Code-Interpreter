    "This problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with `n=128` vertices.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understand the terminology**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices `|V|` is 128.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices `S ⊆ V` is a clique if for every two distinct vertices `u, v ∈ S`, there is an edge `(u, v) ∈ E`. A clique of size `k` is denoted `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph whose vertex set is `S` and whose edge set consists of all edges in `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Clique size that appears as an induced subgraph:** An integer `k` is a possible clique size if there exists a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V` with `|S|=k` such that the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find a single graph `G` on 128 vertices for which the number of such different integers `k` is maximized.\n\n**2. Formalize the problem**\n\nLet `G` be a graph on `n=128` vertices. Let `SizeSet(G)` be the set of all integers `k` for which there exists an induced subgraph of `G` that is a clique of size `k`. We want to find the maximum possible value of `|SizeSet(G)|`.\n\n**3. Analyze the structure of `SizeSet(G)`**\n\nLet's establish a relationship between `SizeSet(G)` and the clique number of `G`, denoted `ω(G)`, which is the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Equivalence of \"clique\" and \"induced clique\"**\n    A subset of vertices `S` is a clique if and only if the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph.\n    *   If `S` is a clique, then by definition, all pairs of vertices in `S` are connected. The induced subgraph `G[S]` contains exactly these vertices and all edges between them, so `G[S]` is a `K_{|S|}`.\n    *   Conversely, if `G[S]` is a `K_{|S|}`, it means every pair of vertices in `S` is connected by an edge in `G`, which is the definition of `S` being a clique.\n    This means that `SizeSet(G)` is simply the set of all possible sizes of cliques that exist in `G`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The structure of the set of clique sizes**\n    Let `ω(G)` be the size of the largest clique in `G`. By the equivalence above, `ω(G)` is the maximum value in `SizeSet(G)`.\n    Now, consider any clique `C_k` in `G` of size `k > 1`. `k` is in `SizeSet(G)`.\n    If we take any subset of `C_k` of size `k-1`, let's call it `C_{k-1}`, then `C_{k-1}` is also a clique. This is because all vertices in `C_k` are connected to each other, so all vertices in the subset `C_{k-1}` are also connected to each other.\n    This implies that if `k ∈ SizeSet(G)` and `k > 1`, then `(k-1) ∈ SizeSet(G)`.\n    By repeated application, if the largest clique size is `ω(G)`, then `ω(G)-1`, `ω(G)-2`, ..., `1` must also be possible clique sizes.\n    Therefore, the set of all possible clique sizes is a continuous range of integers from 1 up to the maximum size.\n    `SizeSet(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The number of different sizes**\n    From the previous point, the number of different clique sizes that can appear is simply the size of the set `SizeSet(G)`, which is `|{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}| = ω(G)`.\n\n**4. Reframe the problem**\n\nThe problem of maximizing the number of different clique sizes is now equivalent to maximizing the clique number `ω(G)` for a graph `G` on `n=128` vertices.\n\n**5. Solve the simplified problem**\n\nWe need to find `max_{G: |V|=128} ω(G)`.\n\n*   The size of a clique in a graph cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph. So, for any graph `G` on 128 vertices, `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n*   We need to check if this maximum value is achievable. Consider the complete graph `K_{128}`. This is a graph on 128 vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   In `K_{128}`, the entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique. Therefore, the clique number is `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum possible clique number `ω(G)` for a graph on 128 vertices is 128.\nSince the number of different induced clique sizes is equal to `ω(G)`, the maximum possible number is 128.\nThis is achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`, which contains induced subgraphs isomorphic to `K_k` for all `k` from 1 to 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
