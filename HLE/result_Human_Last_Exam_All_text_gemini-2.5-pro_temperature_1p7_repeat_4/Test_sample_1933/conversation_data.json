    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where $S$ is a schema with 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\n*   **Schema S:** The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates, which we can denote as $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. A unary predicate is a property that an element in the domain of a model either has or does not have.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$:** This denotes a specific fragment of first-order logic over the schema $S$. The allowed logical constructs are:\n    *   **$\\exists$**: Existential quantifier. The universal quantifier ($\\forall$) is not allowed.\n    *   **$\\land$**: Conjunction (AND). Other connectives like disjunction ($\\lor$), negation ($\\neg$), and implication ($\\rightarrow$) are not allowed.\n    *   **$\\top, \\bot$**: Logical constants for True and False.\n    *   Atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(x)$, where $P_i$ is a predicate from $S$ and $x$ is a variable.\n*   **VC Dimension:** The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the capacity or complexity of a concept class. For a logical language, we typically define the concept class based on the sets defined by its formulas.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Concept Class\n\nTo measure the VC dimension of a logic, we must first define the concept class it represents. In the standard setting for logical queries:\n1.  We fix a model (or database instance) $\\mathcal{M}$ with a domain $D$.\n2.  A formula $\\phi(x)$ with exactly one free variable, $x$, defines a subset of the domain $D$, which is called a concept: $\\phi^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{ a \\in D \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(a) \\}$.\n3.  The set of all such concepts definable by the logic for a fixed model $\\mathcal{M}$ forms the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n4.  The VC dimension of the logic is the supremum of the VC dimensions of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ over all possible models $\\mathcal{M}$: $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\text{Logic}) = \\sup_{\\mathcal{M}} \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}})$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of Formulas\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in our logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. A formula is built using conjunctions of atomic formulas and existentially quantified formulas.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic can be rearranged into an equivalent form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv C(x) \\land S$\nwhere:\n*   $C(x)$ is a conjunction of all atomic formulas involving the free variable $x$. Since our predicates are unary, $C(x)$ must be of the form $P_{i_1}(x) \\land P_{i_2}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_k}(x)$. This is a **monotone conjunction** of predicates applied to $x$.\n*   $S$ is a **sentence** (a formula with no free variables), which is a conjunction of existentially quantified formulas (e.g., $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m (\\psi(\\vec{y}))$).\n\nFor any given model $\\mathcal{M}$, the sentence $S$ is either true or false.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models S$, then $\\phi(x)$ is false for any assignment to $x$, and the concept defined is the empty set: $\\phi^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\emptyset$.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\models S$, the truth of $\\phi(x)$ depends only on $C(x)$. The concept defined is $\\phi^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{a \\in D \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models C(a)\\}$.\n\nThe sentence part $S$ acts as a gate; it can only select between a concept defined by a monotone conjunction and the empty set. The fundamental building blocks for non-empty concepts are the monotone conjunctions $C(x)$.\nThe set of predicates is $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. The number of possible monotone conjunctions we can form is $2^4 = 16$ (one for each subset of predicates, including the empty conjunction which is $\\top$).\n\nThus, for any model $\\mathcal{M}$, the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is a subset of the class of concepts definable by all possible monotone conjunctions of the four predicates:\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{ \\{a \\in D \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(a)\\} \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$\nThe problem reduces to finding the VC dimension of the class of concepts defined by monotone conjunctions of 4 predicates. The known result is that the VC dimension of monotone conjunctions over $d$ attributes is $d$. Here $d=4$.\n\nWe will now formally prove this by establishing a lower and an upper bound.\n\n### Step 4: Proving the Lower Bound (VCdim $\\ge 4$)\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists a model $\\mathcal{M}$ in which a set of 4 elements can be shattered.\nLet's construct such a model. Let the domain be $D = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\nWe define the interpretation of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ on these elements as follows:\n$P_i(x_j)$ is true if and only if $i \\ne j$.\n\nFor example:\n*   For $x_1$: $P_1(x_1)$ is False, $P_2(x_1), P_3(x_1), P_4(x_1)$ are True.\n*   For $x_2$: $P_2(x_2)$ is False, $P_1(x_2), P_3(x_2), P_4(x_2)$ are True.\n*   And so on.\n\nTo shatter the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$, for any target subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we must find a formula $\\phi_Y(x)$ in our logic such that $\\{a \\in X \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi_Y(a)\\} = Y$.\n\nLet $Y \\subseteq X$. Let $I_Y = \\{i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$.\nConsider the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_Y} P_i(x)$. This is a monotone conjunction and is a valid formula in our logic.\n\nLet's check which elements $x_j \\in X$ satisfy this formula:\n$\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi_Y(x_j) \\iff \\mathcal{M} \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_Y} P_i(x_j)$\n$\\iff$ For all $i \\in I_Y$, $P_i(x_j)$ is true.\n$\\iff$ For all $i \\in I_Y$, $i \\ne j$ (by our construction).\n$\\iff j \\notin I_Y$.\n$\\iff x_j \\in Y$ (by definition of $I_Y$).\n\nSo, the set of elements from $X$ satisfying $\\phi_Y(x)$ is exactly $Y$. Since this works for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, our concept class shatters $X$. As we have shattered a set of size 4, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 5: Proving the Upper Bound (VCdim $\\le 4$)\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at most 4, we must show that no set of size 5 can be shattered in any model $\\mathcal{M}$.\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be an arbitrary model with domain $D$, and let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ be any subset of $D$ of size 5.\n\nAs established in Step 3, the set of concepts definable in $\\mathcal{M}$, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}$, is a subset of the concepts definable by the 16 possible monotone conjunctions of the 4 predicates.\nLet $\\mathcal{C}_X = \\{C \\cap X \\mid C \\in \\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}\\}$ be the set of subsets of $X$ that can be \"cut out\" by our concepts. The size of this collection is at most the number of available concepts, so $|\\mathcal{C}_X| \\le |\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}| \\le 16$.\n\nTo shatter the set $X$ of size 5, we would need to be able to generate every possible subset of $X$. The number of subsets of $X$ is $2^{|X|} = 2^5 = 32$.\nTo shatter $X$, we require $|\\mathcal{C}_X| = 32$.\nHowever, we have shown that $|\\mathcal{C}_X| \\le 16$.\nSince $16 < 32$, there are not enough definable concepts to generate all subsets of $X$. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered. This holds for any model $\\mathcal{M}$.\nThis implies that the VC dimension is less than 5, i.e., VCdim $\\le 4$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\n\nFrom Step 4, we have VCdim $\\ge 4$.\nFrom Step 5, we have VCdim $\\le 4$.\nCombining these two bounds, the VC dimension must be exactly 4."
