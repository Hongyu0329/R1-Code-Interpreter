    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of curve and its properties.**\nThe curve described by the parametric equations x(t) = A*cos(at) and y(t) = B*sin(bt) is known as a Lissajous curve. In this specific problem, we have A=1, B=1, a=9, and b=5.\n\nA self-intersection point is a point in the plane that the curve passes through at two or more different times. To find the number of such points, we need to find the number of distinct points (x, y) for which there exist at least two different values of t, say t1 and t2, in the fundamental period of the curve, such that:\nx(t1) = x(t2)\ny(t1) = y(t2)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the fundamental period of the curve.**\nThe period of the x-component, x(t) = cos(9t), is Tx = 2π / 9.\nThe period of the y-component, y(t) = sin(5t), is Ty = 2π / 5.\nThe curve will complete its entire path and start to retrace itself after a time T that is the least common multiple (LCM) of Tx and Ty.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCD(9, 5)) = 2π * (1/1) = 2π.\nSo, we are looking for self-intersections for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the standard formula for self-intersections of Lissajous curves.**\nFor a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, there is a well-known formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points.\n\nLet n = a / GCD(a, b) and m = b / GCD(a, b). The parameters n and m are coprime. The formula for the number of self-intersection points, N, is:\nN = (n - 1)(m - 1) / 2\n\n**Step 4: Check the conditions and apply the formula to the given curve.**\nFor the curve (cos(9t), sin(5t)), we have a = 9 and b = 5.\n\n*   First, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b:\n    GCD(9, 5) = 1.\n*   Since the GCD is 1, a and b are already coprime. So, we have:\n    n = a = 9\n    m = b = 5\n*   The formula is applicable as n and m are integers and coprime.\n*   Now, we substitute the values of n and m into the formula:\n    N = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2\n*   Perform the calculation:\n    N = (8) * (4) / 2\n    N = 32 / 2\n    N = 16\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to use the correct formula. Different parametrizations of Lissajous curves (e.g., using sin for both components, or having a different phase shift) can have different formulas for the number of self-intersections. The formula N = (n-1)(m-1)/2 is standard for the x=cos(nt), y=sin(mt) form where n and m are coprime.\n*   The direct algebraic method of solving x(t1)=x(t2) and y(t1)=y(t2) can be very complex. It often counts pairs of times (t1, t2) rather than the number of unique intersection points, which can lead to overcounting and an incorrect final answer if not handled carefully. Relying on the established formula is a more direct and reliable approach.\n*   The formula holds for coprime n and m. If the original a and b are not coprime, you must first divide them by their GCD to get n and m before applying the formula. In this case, a=9 and b=5 are already coprime.\n\nThe analysis using the standard formula gives a clear and concise result. The number of self-intersection points for the given curve is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
