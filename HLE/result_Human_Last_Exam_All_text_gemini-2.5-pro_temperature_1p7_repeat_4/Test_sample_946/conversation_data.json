    "**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Query:** The question asks for the name of a specific character from a specific piece of media.\n    *   **Media Franchise:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n    *   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n    *   **Event within the Episode:** The Junior Prom.\n    *   **Object of Interest:** A cardboard cutout.\n    *   **Role of the Object:** \"Performs\" as a singer.\n    *   **Nature of the Character:** A fictional singer (within the Homestar Runner universe).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Specificity:** The answer must come *only* from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". Information from other episodes, while potentially related to the character, is not directly what the question asks for.\n*   **Fictional Nature:** The singer is not a real-world artist but a character created for the Homestar Runner cartoons.\n*   **\"Performs\":** The word \"performs\" is used humorously. A cardboard cutout cannot actually perform; it is simply presented as the musical entertainment for the prom.\n*   **Character Name:** The goal is to identify the name of the fictional singer/band depicted on the cutout.\n\n**Acquiring the Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Locate the Scene:** We must mentally (or literally) review the events of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". The episode's plot centers on the girls attending their Junior Prom.\n2.  **Identify the Entertainment:** During the prom scene, the \"live band\" is revealed. True to the low-budget, hand-drawn style of Teen Girl Squad, the entertainment is not a real band.\n3.  **Examine the Object:** The episode clearly shows a cardboard cutout on a small stage. In front of the cutout is a microphone on a stand.\n4.  **Identify the Name:** Written prominently on the cardboard cutout is the name of the fictional musical act. That name is \"SLOSHY\".\n5.  **Confirm the Character:** Sloshy is a recurring fictional band within the Homestar Runner universe, known for their mopey, alternative-rock style songs, making them a humorous choice for a prom band. Their appearance as a cardboard cutout is the punchline.\n\nTherefore, the cardboard cutout that \"performs\" at the Junior prom is of the fictional singer/band Sloshy.\n\n<<<Sloshy>>>"
