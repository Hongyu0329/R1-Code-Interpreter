    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the genus of mushroom known for a blue spore print.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe user is asking for the specific scientific name of a mushroom *genus*. The key identifying feature is that it is the only genus known to produce a \"distinctly blue spore print.\"\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Terminology**\n*   **Genus:** This is a taxonomic rank above species. For example, in *Homo sapiens*, *Homo* is the genus.\n*   **Spore Print:** This is a critical identification tool in mycology. It is the color of the mass of spores dropped from the mushroom's cap. The color of the mushroom's body can be very different from its spore print color.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate Common Misconceptions (Careful Points)**\n*   **Blue-Staining Mushrooms:** Many mushrooms, particularly in the genera *Psilocybe* and *Boletus*, turn blue when bruised or damaged. This is due to a chemical reaction (oxidation of psilocin or other compounds). However, their spore prints are not blue. *Psilocybe* has a purple-brown to black spore print, and boletes typically have an olive-brown print.\n*   **Blue-Colored Mushrooms:** Some mushrooms are naturally blue in color. The most famous example is *Lactarius indigo*. While this mushroom is a striking indigo blue and even \"bleeds\" blue latex, its spore print is actually cream to yellowish, not blue.\n\n**Step 4: Research the Specific Trait of a Blue Spore Print**\nA blue spore print is exceptionally rare in the fungal kingdom, making this a very specific identifying feature. Standard mycology charts of spore print colors (white, pink, brown, black) often don't even include blue as a possibility.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Correct Genus**\nThrough detailed mycological research, we find that there is indeed one genus that contains species known to produce a blue spore print.\n*   The genus is **Entoloma**.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to note that not all species in the *Entoloma* genus have blue spores. In fact, the genus as a whole is characterized by its signature pink or salmon-pink spore print and angular spores.\n*   However, the question asks for a genus \"known to produce\" this trait. A few specific species within *Entoloma*, most notably *Entoloma madidum* from Australia and New Zealand, produce a distinct sky-blue spore print when fresh (it can fade to pinkish over time). Other species like *Entoloma subviolaceum* are also reported to have spores with a violet-blueish tint.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nBecause species that produce a genuinely blue spore print exist within the genus *Entoloma*, it is recognized as the single genus known for this unique characteristic, even though it's not a trait shared by all its members.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
