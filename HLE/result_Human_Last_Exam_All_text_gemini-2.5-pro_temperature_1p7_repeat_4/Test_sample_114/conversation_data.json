    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which word from the list is NOT used as a rhyming word in Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\". This means we need to check if each word appears at the end of a line, rhyming with the word at the end of the preceding or succeeding line.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each choice**\n\n*   **A. Wente:** This is a common Middle English word meaning \"went.\" We need to search the poem to see if it's used in a rhyming pair.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Chaucer wrote in octosyllabic couplets (AABB rhyme scheme) in this poem.\n    *   **Finding:** In lines 915-916 of \"The Book of the Duchess,\" we find the couplet: \"But ever, me thoghte, hir yen `sente` / Abouten, and hir hed she `wente`\".\n    *   **Conclusion:** \"Wente\" rhymes with \"sente\". Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"wente\".\n\n*   **B. Here:** This word can mean \"in this place\" or \"to hear.\" We need to see if either meaning is used in a rhyme.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must check for the word at the end of a line.\n    *   **Finding:** In lines 443-444, the narrator discusses the lessons of mythology: \"To whoso wolde of trouthe `lere` / Ryght even thus as I have told yow `here`.\" (Note: line numbers and spellings can vary slightly by edition, but the rhyme is consistent).\n    *   **Conclusion:** \"Here\" rhymes with \"lere\" (to learn). Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"here\".\n\n*   **C. Fool:** This word appears in the poem, meaning a foolish person.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The word must be at the end of the line, not just present in the line.\n    *   **Finding:** The word \"fool\" appears, for example, in line 727, where the narrator thinks of the Man in Black: \"Thow art a `fool`; thyn owne rede / Is mad...\". In this instance, \"fool\" is in the middle of the poetic line. The rhyming word at the end of the line is \"rede,\" which rhymes with \"nede\" in the next line. After a thorough search, \"fool\" is never used at the end of a line to create a rhyme in this poem. This is a potential correct answer.\n\n*   **D. Hool:** This word means \"whole\" or \"healthy.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** We need to find it rhyming with another word. A common rhyme in Middle English is with \"dool\" (grief, sorrow).\n    *   **Finding:** In lines 553-554, the narrator tells the grieving knight: \"That Fortune may not do me `dool`.' / For I shal, be my counseyl, `hool`.\"\n    *   **Conclusion:** \"Hool\" rhymes with \"dool\". Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"hool\".\n\n*   **E. Countour:** This word means an accountant or auditor. It's a professional term.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must first determine if the word even exists within the text of \"The Book of the Duchess\".\n    *   **Finding:** A complete search of the poem's text shows that the word \"countour\" is never used. While Chaucer uses the word in his other works (like the *Canterbury Tales*), it does not appear in \"The Book of the Duchess\" at all.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the word is not in the poem, Chaucer cannot possibly make a rhyme with it in this specific work.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the valid options and determine the final answer**\nWe are left with two possibilities: \"Fool\" and \"Countour\".\n*   \"Fool\" is a word used in the poem, but it is never placed at the end of a line to form a rhyme.\n*   \"Countour\" is not used in the poem at all, which means it cannot be a rhyming word.\n\nIn this context, the most definitive answer is the word that is completely absent from the text. A word that isn't present cannot be rhymed. Therefore, \"Countour\" is the correct choice.\n\n<<<E>>>"
