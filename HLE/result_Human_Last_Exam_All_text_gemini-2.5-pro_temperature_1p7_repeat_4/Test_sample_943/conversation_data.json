    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Tensor and Slice Rank\n\nThe tensor $T$ is a function from $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$ defined by:\n\\[ T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1 \\]\nwhere $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, $y=(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$, and $z=(z_1, \\dots, z_n)$ are vectors in $\\{0, 1\\}^n$. The additions and products are standard operations in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe tensor lives in the space $V_1^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$, where each $V_k^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of complex-valued functions on $\\{0,1\\}^n$. This is a space of dimension $2^n$. The total tensor space is $(\\mathbb{C}^{2^n})^{\\otimes 3}$.\n\nThe **slice rank** of a 3-tensor is the smallest number of \"slices\" that sum up to the tensor. A slice is a tensor of rank 1 in one of its modes, i.e., it can be written in one of the forms $u \\otimes A$, $B \\otimes v$, or $C \\otimes w$, where $u,v,w$ are vectors and $A,B,C$ are 2-tensors (matrices). A rank-1 tensor $u \\otimes v \\otimes w$ is a simple example of a slice.\n\nWe are given that the slice rank of $T$ is of the form $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$ and we need to find $K$. This requires us to determine the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank of $T$.\n\n### Step 2: Upper Bound on the Slice Rank\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the tensor $T$. It consists of two parts:\n1.  $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$\n2.  $J(x, y, z) = 1$ (the constant-one function)\n\nSo, $T = P - J$. The slice rank is subadditive, so $\\text{SR}(T) \\le \\text{SR}(P) + \\text{SR}(J)$.\n\nThe tensor $J$ is the tensor where every entry is 1. It can be written as $J = \\mathbf{1} \\otimes \\mathbf{1} \\otimes \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is the all-ones vector (function) in the corresponding space. As a rank-1 tensor, its slice rank is 1. So, $\\text{SR}(J) = 1$.\n\nNow, let's analyze $P(x, y, z)$. We can expand the product:\n\\[ P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) = \\sum_{s \\in \\{x,y,z\\}^n} \\prod_{i=1}^n s_i \\]\nwhere each $s_i$ is chosen from $\\{x_i, y_i, z_i\\}$.\nLet's group the terms based on which variables ($x, y, or z$) are chosen at each position $i$. For each partition of the index set $[n]$ into three disjoint sets $I_x, I_y, I_z$, we get a term in the expansion:\n\\[ \\left(\\prod_{i \\in I_x} x_i\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j \\in I_y} y_j\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k \\in I_z} z_k\\right) \\]\nLet $u_{I_x}(x) = \\prod_{i \\in I_x} x_i$, $v_{I_y}(y) = \\prod_{j \\in I_y} y_j$, and $w_{I_z}(z) = \\prod_{k \\in I_z} z_k$. Each of these is a function on $\\{0,1\\}^n$. The term is then $u_{I_x} \\otimes v_{I_y} \\otimes w_{I_z}$. This is a rank-1 tensor.\n\nThe full tensor $P$ is the sum of these terms over all possible partitions of $[n]$ into three sets:\n\\[ P = \\sum_{I_x \\cup I_y \\cup I_z = [n]} u_{I_x} \\otimes v_{I_y} \\otimes w_{I_z} \\]\nThe number of such partitions is the number of functions from $[n]$ to a set of 3 elements, which is $3^n$.\nSince $P$ is a sum of $3^n$ rank-1 tensors, and each rank-1 tensor is a slice, the slice rank of $P$ is at most $3^n$.\nTherefore, $\\text{SR}(T) \\le \\text{SR}(P) + \\text{SR}(J) \\le 3^n + 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Lower Bound on the Slice Rank\n\nA powerful technique for finding lower bounds on slice rank involves the Fourier transform. Let $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^n$. We view the domain $\\{0,1\\}^n$ as this group. The characters are $\\chi_a(x) = (-1)^{a \\cdot x}$ for $a, x \\in G$. The Fourier transform of $T$ is a tensor $\\hat{T}$ on $G \\times G \\times G$ given by:\n\\[ \\hat{T}(a,b,c) = \\sum_{x,y,z \\in G} T(x,y,z) (-1)^{a \\cdot x + b \\cdot y + c \\cdot z} \\]\nThe support of the Fourier transform, $\\text{supp}(\\hat{T})$, provides a lower bound on the slice rank. A known result states that the slice rank of a tensor $T$ is at least the minimum number of \"lines\" needed to cover the support of its Fourier transform $\\hat{T}$. A line is a set like $\\{(a, b_0, c_0) \\mid a \\in G\\}$ for fixed $b_0, c_0$ (or fixing other pairs of coordinates).\n\nLet's compute the Fourier transform $\\hat{T}$.\n$\\hat{T}(a,b,c) = \\widehat{(P-J)}(a,b,c) = \\hat{P}(a,b,c) - \\hat{J}(a,b,c)$.\n$\\hat{J}(a,b,c) = \\sum_{x,y,z} 1 \\cdot (-1)^{a \\cdot x + \\dots} = (\\sum_x (-1)^{a \\cdot x}) (\\sum_y (-1)^{b \\cdot y}) (\\sum_z (-1)^{c \\cdot z}) = (2^n\\delta_{a,0})(2^n\\delta_{b,0})(2^n\\delta_{c,0}) = 8^n \\delta_{a,0}\\delta_{b,0}\\delta_{c,0}$.\n\n$\\hat{P}(a,b,c) = \\sum_{x,y,z} \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i+y_i+z_i)\\right) (-1)^{a \\cdot x + \\dots} = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\sum_{x_i,y_i,z_i \\in \\{0,1\\}} (x_i+y_i+z_i)(-1)^{a_ix_i+b_iy_i+c_iz_i} \\right)$.\nLet's analyze the inner sum $S(a_i, b_i, c_i)$. A calculation (as detailed in the scratchpad) shows that this sum is non-zero if and only if at most one of $a_i, b_i, c_i$ is 1.\n\nThis implies that $\\hat{P}(a,b,c)$ is non-zero if and only if for all $i \\in [n]$, at most one of $a_i,b_i,c_i$ is 1. This condition means that the supports of the vectors $a, b, c$ (viewed as sets of indices where they are non-zero) are pairwise disjoint. Let's denote this set of triples as $\\Sigma_n = \\{(a,b,c) \\in G^3 \\mid \\text{supp}(a) \\cap \\text{supp}(b) = \\text{supp}(a) \\cap \\text{supp}(c) = \\text{supp}(b) \\cap \\text{supp}(c) = \\emptyset\\}$.\n\nThe support of $\\hat{P}$ is exactly $\\Sigma_n$. The support of $\\hat{T}$ is also $\\Sigma_n$, because $\\hat{J}$ only affects the value at $(0,0,0)$, and $(0,0,0)$ is in $\\Sigma_n$. The calculation shows that $\\hat{T}(a,b,c)$ is non-zero for all $(a,b,c) \\in \\Sigma_n$.\n\nNow we need to find the minimum number of lines needed to cover $\\Sigma_n$. Consider covering $\\Sigma_n$ with lines of the form $L(b_0, c_0) = \\{(a,b_0,c_0) \\mid a \\in G\\}$. To cover the whole set $\\Sigma_n$, for any $(a',b',c') \\in \\Sigma_n$, we need to have selected the line corresponding to $(b_0,c_0)=(b',c')$. So we need one line for each pair $(b,c)$ for which there exists an $a$ such that $(a,b,c) \\in \\Sigma_n$.\nThe condition for this is that $\\text{supp}(b) \\cap \\text{supp}(c) = \\emptyset$. Let $a=0$. Then $(0,b,c) \\in \\Sigma_n$. So, for every pair $(b,c)$ with disjoint support, we need a line.\n\nThe number of pairs $(b,c) \\in G \\times G$ with disjoint support is calculated by considering each coordinate $i \\in [n]$ independently. For each coordinate, $(b_i, c_i)$ can be $(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)$, but not $(1,1)$. There are 3 choices for each of the $n$ coordinates. So, there are $3^n$ such pairs.\nThis means we need at least $3^n$ lines of this type to cover $\\Sigma_n$. By symmetry, using any combination of the three types of lines also leads to a lower bound of $3^n$. Thus, $\\text{SR}(T) \\ge 3^n$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation of K\n\nWe have established the following bounds for the slice rank of $T$:\n\\[ 3^n \\le \\text{SR}(T) \\le 3^n + 1 \\]\nFor large $n$, the $+1$ term is negligible. Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank is:\n\\[ \\text{SR}(T) = 3^n e^{o(n)} \\]\nWe are given that the slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. Comparing the two forms:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{3}{2^K}\\right)^n = 3^n \\]\nTaking the $n$-th root on both sides:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2^K} = 3 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 2^K \\]\nThis implies that $K=0$."
