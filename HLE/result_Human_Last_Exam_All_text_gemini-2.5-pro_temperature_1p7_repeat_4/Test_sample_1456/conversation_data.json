    "This problem asks for the maximum number of composants in the product space of two nondegenerate continua. Let's break down the problem and its solution methodically.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, we must have a clear understanding of the topological concepts involved.\n\n*   **Continuum:** As defined in the question, a continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** This means the continuum is not a single point; it has at least two distinct points. This is a crucial condition.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A *proper* subcontinuum of X is a subcontinuum K such that K is a proper subset of X (i.e., K ≠ X).\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum X, the composant of `p`, denoted `Comp(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in X for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both `p` and `q`. The relation \"`p` and `q` are in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are the composants of the space. All composants are disjoint, and their union is the entire space X.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Key Theorems\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to consider several key facts about continua and their composants.\n\n1.  **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continua:**\n    *   A continuum is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Examples include a closed interval `[0, 1]`, a circle, or a square.\n    *   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable. The standard examples are the **Knaster continuum** (or bucket-handle continuum) and the **pseudo-arc**.\n\n2.  **Number of Composants:** The number of composants a continuum has depends critically on whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   **Theorem:** A decomposable continuum has exactly **one** composant. In such a space, any two points can be joined by a proper subcontinuum.\n    *   **Theorem:** A nondegenerate indecomposable continuum has **uncountably many** composants. Specifically, it has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, `2^ℵ₀`) composants. Each composant in an indecomposable continuum is a dense subset of the space.\n\n3.  **Product of Continua:** If X and Y are continua, their product X × Y (with the product topology) is also a continuum. This is because the product of two compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem), and the product of two connected spaces is connected.\n\n4.  **Composants of a Product Space (The Key Theorem):** The core of the problem lies in understanding how the composants of a product space `X × Y` relate to the composants of the individual spaces `X` and `Y`.\n    *   **Theorem:** The composants of the product continuum `X × Y` are precisely the sets of the form `A × B`, where `A` is a composant of `X` and `B` is a composant of `Y`.\n    *   This means there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of composants of `X × Y` and the Cartesian product of the set of composants of `X` and the set of composants of `Y`.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Solution\n\nOur goal is to find the *largest possible number* of composants for a product `X × Y`, where `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua.\n\n1.  **Relate the Number of Composants:** Let `C(S)` denote the set of composants of a space `S`. From the key theorem mentioned in point #4 above, the set of a of `X × Y` is in bijection with the set `C(X) × C(Y)`. Therefore, the number of a of the product is the product of the number of a of the factors:\n    `|C(X × Y)| = |C(X)| × |C(Y)|`.\n\n2.  **Maximize the Number of Factors:** To maximize the product `|C(X)| × |C(Y)|`, we need to choose continua `X` and `Y` that have the maximum possible number of a.\n\n3.  **Determine Maximum Composants for a Single Continuum:** As established in point #2, the number of a for a nondegenerate continuum `X` is:\n    *   **1** if `X` is decomposable.\n    *   **c** (the cardinality of the continuum) if `X` is indecomposable.\n\n4.  **Choose the Optimal Continua:** To achieve the largest possible number of a in the product, we must choose both `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate **indecomposable** continua. For example, we can let `X` be the Knaster continuum and `Y` also be the Knaster continuum (or another indecomposable continuum like the pseudo-arc).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Number:** For this choice of `X` and `Y`:\n    *   `|C(X)| = c`\n    *   `|C(Y)| = c`\n    The number of a in their product `X × Y` is:\n    `|C(X × Y)| = c × c`\n\n6.  **Perform Cardinal Arithmetic:** The cardinality of the continuum, `c`, is `2^ℵ₀`. The product of `c` with itself is:\n    `c × c = (2^ℵ₀) × (2^ℵ₀) = 2^(ℵ₀ + ℵ₀) = 2^ℵ₀ = c`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The product `c × c` is equal to `c`. Therefore, the largest possible number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe largest possible number of a is achieved when both continua are indecomposable. In this case, each has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum) a. The number of a of their product is the product of their individual numbers of a, which is **c × c = c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
