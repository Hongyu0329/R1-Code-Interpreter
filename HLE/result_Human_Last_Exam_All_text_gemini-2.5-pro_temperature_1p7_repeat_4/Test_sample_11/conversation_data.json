    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** The first statute to introduce the concept of \"good faith.\"\n    *   **Jurisdiction:** The modern State of Israel (founded in 1948).\n    *   **Key Condition:** The statute must *explicitly* introduce the concept. This means the literal term for \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*) must appear in the text of the law, rather than just being an implied principle.\n    *   **Formatting Constraints:** The final answer must not start with \"The\" and must not include the year of enactment.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Knowledge:**\n    *   The most famous Israeli law regarding \"good faith\" is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 elevated \"good faith\" to a supreme principle in Israeli law, governing pre-contractual negotiations and the performance of contractual obligations. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, and 1973 is relatively late. This serves as a baseline date to predate.\n\n3.  **Investigating Earlier Civil Legislation:**\n    *   Working backwards from 1973, we examine other major codifications of Israeli civil law.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 9 of this law deals with conflicting transactions involving immovable property. It gives priority to a second purchaser if the transaction was completed \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*) and for consideration. This law explicitly uses the term and predates the Contracts Law.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 34 of this law establishes the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat hashuk*) for movable property. It states that a buyer acquires good title from a seller who was not the owner, provided the buyer acted \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*). This explicitly uses the term and predates the Land Law.\n\n4.  **Investigating Pre-1968 Legislation:**\n    *   The search must now extend to statutes passed between 1948 and 1968. Much of Israeli law from this period consists of \"New Versions\" of British Mandate-era Ordinances. The Knesset re-enacted these ordinances in Hebrew, making them official statutes of the State of Israel.\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This is a crucial piece of commercial legislation. The concept of a \"holder in due course\" is central to this law. Section 28(a) of the ordinance defines a holder in due course as someone who takes a bill, among other conditions, \"**in good faith** and for value\" (*בתום לב ובעד ערך* - *be-tom lev u-ve'ad erekh*).\n\n5.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    *   The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] was enacted in **1957**.\n    *   The Sale Law was enacted in **1968**.\n    *   The Land Law was enacted in **1969**.\n    *   The Contracts (General Part) Law was enacted in **1973**.\n    *   Comparing the dates, the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957,** is the earliest statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly uses the term \"good faith\".\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The identified statute is the \"Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957\".\n*   According to the formatting instructions, I must remove \"the\" (which is not present) and the year.\n*   The final answer is the name of the statute itself.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
