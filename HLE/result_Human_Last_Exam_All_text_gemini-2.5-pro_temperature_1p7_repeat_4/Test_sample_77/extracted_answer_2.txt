No, the setup would not function as required because the obstacle object, a plane, would fail to stop the fluid. Fluid solvers require obstacles to be solid, volumetric (3D) meshes with thickness. A standard 2D plane has zero thickness and will likely be ignored by the solver, allowing fluid to pass straight through it.
