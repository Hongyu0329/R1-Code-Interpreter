Yes, the theory can fail. The birefringent medium alters the polarization of the light beam. A real-world random medium's scattering and absorption properties are almost always dependent on polarization. By changing the light's polarization before it enters the random medium, the birefringent plate can couple the beam into a state that is strongly scattered or absorbed by the medium. This leads to an irreversible loss of information, which makes the overall optical system non-invertible, thus causing the theory of perfect inversion to fail.
