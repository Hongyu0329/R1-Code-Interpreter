    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n    *   **Structure and Stereochemistry:** We need to determine the spatial arrangement of the bromo (Br) and methyl (CH₃) groups on the cyclohexane ring. The (1S, 2R) designation tells us the absolute configuration at the two chiral centers. A key consequence of this specific configuration is that the Br and CH₃ groups are *trans* to each other.\n    *   **Chair Conformations:** A *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two different chair conformations that are in equilibrium:\n        *   **Conformer A (diequatorial):** The bromine atom is in an equatorial position, and the methyl group is also in an equatorial position. This is a very stable conformation because bulky groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position.\n        *   **Conformer B (diaxial):** The bromine atom is in an axial position, and the methyl group is also in an axial position. This is a very unstable conformation due to significant steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions).\n    *   **Equilibrium:** The equilibrium will heavily favor the more stable diequatorial Conformer A. The molecule will spend almost all of its time in this conformation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reagents:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH).\n    *   **Potassium tert-butoxide** is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide (the reactant) with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n\n3.  **Apply the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction:**\n    *   The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed (a β-proton) must be **anti-periplanar**.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, anti-periplanar translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement. This means both the leaving group and the β-proton must be in axial positions, on adjacent carbons, and pointing in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n\n4.  **Identify the Reactive Conformation:**\n    *   Let's look at the two conformers of our reactant:\n        *   **Conformer A (diequatorial):** The Br group is equatorial. An equatorial group is never anti-periplanar to any adjacent proton. Therefore, **Conformer A cannot undergo an E2 reaction.**\n        *   **Conformer B (diaxial):** The Br group is axial. This conformer **can** undergo an E2 reaction, provided there is an anti-periplanar β-proton.\n    *   Even though Conformer B is highly unstable and present in only a tiny concentration, the reaction must proceed through this conformation. According to the Curtin-Hammett principle, the rapid equilibrium between conformers allows the reaction to drain through the reactive minor conformer.\n\n5.  **Identify the Site of Elimination:**\n    *   We must examine the β-protons (protons on carbons C2 and C6) in the reactive **Conformer B (diaxial)**. In this conformation, the Br on C1 is axial and the CH₃ on C2 is also axial.\n    *   **β-proton on C2:** Since the methyl group is axial, the proton on C2 must be equatorial. An equatorial proton is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, **elimination towards C2 is impossible.**\n    *   **β-protons on C6:** This carbon has two protons. One is axial and the other is equatorial. The **axial proton on C6 is trans-diaxial** (and therefore anti-periplanar) to the axial bromine on C1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The tert-butoxide base can only attack and remove the axial proton on C6.\n\n6.  **Determine the Product and its Name:**\n    *   Since the elimination involves the removal of H from C6 and Br from C1, a double bond is formed between C1 and C6.\n    *   The methyl group on C2 is unaffected and remains in the product.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexene derivative with a methyl group on the carbon adjacent to one end of the double bond.\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:** To name the product, we number the ring to give the carbons of the double bond the lowest numbers (1 and 2), and then give the substituent the lowest possible number.\n        *   If we number the double bond as C1-C2 (where C1 was originally C1 or C6), the methyl group (on original C2) will be at position 3.\n    *   The name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the Hofmann product (the less-substituted alkene). The Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) cannot be formed due to the stereochemical constraints of the reactant.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:** The reaction is an E2 elimination. E2 requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton. The reactant must flip to its unstable diaxial conformer for the reaction to occur. In this conformer, only the proton on C6 is anti-periplanar to the Br. Therefore, elimination occurs to form the double bond between C1 and C6, resulting in 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
