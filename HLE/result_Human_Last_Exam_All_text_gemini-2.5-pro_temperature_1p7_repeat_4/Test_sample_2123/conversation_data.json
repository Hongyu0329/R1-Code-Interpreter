    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The question asks for the surname of an English poet. This surname appears in a Russian text (specified as a \"Russian translation of a certain essay,\" which implies the language of the text is Russian) in the context of describing the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Clues**:\n    *   **Subject**: An English poet's surname.\n    *   **Context**: A description of the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\"\n    *   **Source Language**: Russian. The mention of a \"Russian translation\" is crucial, as it points towards a linguistic feature specific to the Russian language, most likely a pun or wordplay.\n    *   **Location**: Vienna.\n\n3.  **Explore the Linguistic Connection**: The puzzle hinges on a phonetic similarity. We need to find a Russian word used to describe \"wide boulevards\" that sounds like the name of an English poet.\n    *   The Russian word for \"wide\" is **широкий** (shirokiy).\n    *   When used as a short-form plural adjective in a sentence like \"the streets are wide,\" the word becomes **широки** (shiroki).\n\n4.  **Find the Pun**: The word **широки** (shiroki) sounds very similar to the Russian transcription of the surname of the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, which is **Шелли** (Shelli). This is a well-known pun in Russian literary circles.\n\n5.  **Identify the Source Text**: This specific observation and wordplay are famously found in the essay on Vienna in the book **\"Genius Loci\" (Гений места)** by the Russian-American writer and journalist **Pyotr Vail (Пётр Вайль)**. He was not translating an English essay but writing his own original work in Russian.\n\n6.  **Verify with the Quote**: In the essay on Vienna, Vail writes:\n    > \"В Вене улицы до того **широки**, что на ум приходит английский поэт **Шелли**.\"\n    *   **Translation**: \"In Vienna, the streets are so **wide (широки)** that the English poet **Shelley (Шелли)** comes to mind.\"\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: This quote perfectly matches all the conditions of the problem. The description of Vienna's wide (широки) boulevards directly evokes the surname of the English poet Shelley (Шелли) due to the phonetic pun in Russian.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Russian translation of an essay\"**: This phrasing can be slightly misleading. The work was originally written in Russian by an author who lived outside Russia. The key takeaway is that the text is in the Russian language, where the pun works.\n*   **Avoiding Red Herrings**: One might be tempted to look for poets who actually lived in or wrote about Vienna, or for whom streets are named there (like Lord Byron in some European cities). However, the structure of the question strongly implies a linguistic trick rather than a historical fact.\n*   **The Specific Word Form**: The pun works with the short plural form of the adjective, \"широки\" (shiroki), not the standard long form \"широкие\" (shirokiye). This level of grammatical detail is what makes the pun elegant.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis clearly points to the pun between the Russian word for \"wide\" (широки) and the surname of the English poet Shelley. Therefore, the surname is Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
