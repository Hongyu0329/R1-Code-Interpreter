    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, we need to understand the two key concepts in the question: \"critical-level views\" and \"Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem\".\n\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** This is a theory in population ethics for how to rank populations. It states that the value of a population is the sum of each individual's welfare level *minus* a positive \"critical level\" (c).\n    *   Value (Population) = Σ (uᵢ - c)\n    *   Here, `uᵢ` is the welfare (or utility) of individual 'i', and `c` is the critical level, which is a positive value (c > 0).\n    *   A crucial implication is that adding a new person to the world with a positive welfare level (a life worth living, u > 0) can actually *decrease* the total value of the population if that person's welfare is below the critical level (0 < u < c).\n\n*   **Arrhenius's Impossibility Theorems:** These are a set of proofs in population ethics showing that it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy several ethically desirable conditions or axioms. The sixth theorem demonstrates an inconsistency between five specific conditions. We need to identify which of these five conditions is violated by the critical-level view.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Condition of the Theorem\n\nLet's examine each of the five conditions listed in the answer choices and test whether the critical-level view violates it.\n\n**A. Egalitarian Dominance:**\n*   **What it says:** This principle prioritizes equality. A common formulation states that if two populations have the same size and same total welfare, the one with a more equal distribution of welfare is better.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level Views:** The value of a population under a critical-level view is Σ(uᵢ - c) = (Σuᵢ) - (n * c), where n is the population size. If two populations have the same size (n) and the same total welfare (Σuᵢ), their value under a critical-level view will be identical, regardless of how that welfare is distributed. The view is indifferent to equality, it does not say a more equal state is worse. While it violates a *strict* preference for equality (by being indifferent), this is not its most fundamental or unique violation.\n\n**B. General Non-Extreme Priority:**\n*   **What it says:** For any positive welfare level *g*, there is a sufficiently large number of people *n*, such that adding these *n* people at welfare level *g* is better than adding one person with a very high welfare level *h*. This condition captures the intuition that quantity can eventually outweigh quality.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level Views:** Let's test this.\n    1.  The value added by one person at a very high level *h* (where *h* > *c*) is: `(h - c)`. This is a positive number.\n    2.  The value added by *n* people at welfare level *g* is: `n * (g - c)`.\n    3.  The condition states that for *any* positive *g*, we can find an *n* that makes `n * (g - c) > (h - c)`.\n    4.  **Here is the violation:** Let's choose a positive welfare level *g* that is *below* the critical level (i.e., 0 < g < c). Because `g < c`, the term `(g - c)` is negative.\n    5.  Therefore, `n * (g - c)` will be a negative number for any `n > 0`.\n    6.  The inequality becomes `(a negative number) > (a positive number)`, which is impossible.\n    7.  Since we have found a positive welfare level *g* for which the condition fails, critical-level views **violate** General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n**C. Non-Elitism:**\n*   **What it says:** For any population, it is possible to make things better by adding a sufficiently large and happy new population.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level Views:** This is satisfied. To improve any existing population, we simply need to add a new group of people whose welfare is above the critical level (*u* > *c*). The value they add, Σ(uᵢ - c), will be positive, thus making the outcome better.\n\n**D. Weak Non-Sadism:**\n*   **What it says:** Adding a group of people with positive welfare is always at least as good as adding a group of the same size with negative welfare.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level Views:** Let's test this. We compare adding *n* people with positive welfare `u+` (> 0) to adding *n* people with negative welfare `u-` (< 0).\n    *   Value added by the positive group: `n * (u+ - c)`\n    *   Value added by the negative group: `n * (u- - c)`\n    *   The condition requires `n * (u+ - c) ≥ n * (u- - c)`. This simplifies to `u+ - c ≥ u- - c`, which further simplifies to `u+ ≥ u-`. Since `u+` is positive and `u-` is negative, this is always true. Thus, critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n**E. Weak Quality Addition:**\n*   **What it says:** There exists at least one high-quality life, such that adding this life would always be an improvement, no matter the starting population.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level Views:** This is satisfied. We can specify a \"high-quality life\" as any life with welfare `u` greater than the critical level `c`. Adding such a person increases the total value by `(u - c)`, which is a positive quantity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that the critical-level view's unique feature—valuing lives with positive but low welfare as having a negative contribution—directly leads to a violation of General Non-Extreme Priority. For welfare levels below the critical level, no amount of quantity can ever outweigh a high-quality addition.\n\n<<<B>>>"
