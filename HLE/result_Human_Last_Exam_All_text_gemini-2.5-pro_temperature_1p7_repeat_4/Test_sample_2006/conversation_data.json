    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Title as a Question\nThe prompt states that the title, \"The Bays\", is a question. The key insight is to recognize the homophone. \"The Bays\" sounds identical to \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\". The haiku that follows must contain the clues to identify these \"B's\".\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Line of the Haiku for Clues\nThe haiku is the source of the answer. We need to analyze each of its three lines to extract a clue, which will point to a word starting with the letter 'B'.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   This line can be interpreted numerically. \"August\" is the 8th month of the year.\n    *   This gives us the number 8.\n    *   We need a word starting with 'B' that is associated with the number 8. In the context of computing and data, a **Byte** is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   This line also provides a number. \"Twice fifteen\" is 2 multiplied by 15, which equals 30.\n    *   The phrase \"brings winds of change\" suggests the transmission of information that can cause a new outcome.\n    *   We need a 'B' word related to 30 and information transmission. In telecommunications, **Baud** is a unit for the symbol rate, or the number of signal changes per second. A 30 baud rate was a common speed for early teletypewriters, which transmitted information that could certainly \"bring winds of change\".\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   This line points to the number 1 (\"A... one\"). The word \"divine\" can be seen as emphasizing the fundamental or elementary nature of this \"one\".\n    *   \"Yields\" means it produces or results in something.\n    *   We are looking for a 'B' word associated with the number 1. The most fundamental unit of information in computing is the **Bit**, which represents a single binary digit (a 1 or a 0).\n\n### Step 3: Consolidate the Answers and Apply the Final Constraint\nFrom the analysis of the haiku, we have found three \"B's\":\n1.  **Byte** (from the first line)\n2.  **Baud** (from the second line)\n3.  **Bit** (from the third line)\n\nThe puzzle has one final instruction: the answer must be in **alphabetical order**.\nArranging our three \"B's\" alphabetically, we get:\n1.  Baud\n2.  Bit\n3.  Byte\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **The Homophone:** The entire puzzle hinges on understanding \"The Bays\" as \"The B's\".\n*   **Numerical Interpretation:** Each line must be translated into a number that acts as the primary clue (8, 30, 1).\n*   **Thematic Consistency:** The answers—Baud, Bit, Byte—are all fundamental units from the fields of computing and telecommunications, making them a thematically consistent set.\n*   **Alphabetical Ordering:** The final answer must be correctly alphabetized as per the user's request.\n\n<<<Baud, Bit, Byte>>>"
