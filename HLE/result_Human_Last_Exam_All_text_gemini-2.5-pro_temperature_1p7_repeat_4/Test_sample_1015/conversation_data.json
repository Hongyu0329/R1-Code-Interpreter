    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods of ballet.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the term \"Cambré Derrière\"**\n*   **Cambré:** A French ballet term meaning \"arched.\" It refers to a bend of the body from the waist in any direction: forward, backward, or to the side.\n*   **Derrière:** A French ballet term meaning \"back\" or \"behind.\"\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A bend of the upper body backward from the waist. It is a fundamental movement designed to increase spinal flexibility, strength, and control.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Core Principles:** The Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, emphasizes precision, strength, epaulement (the artistic use of the head and shoulders), and a logical, methodical progression of training.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Hip Placement:** This is a crucial point. In the Vaganova method, the hips must remain absolutely square and stable, directly over the supporting legs. There is no pushing of the hips forward. The integrity of the alignment from the feet through the pelvis is paramount to protect the lower back.\n    *   **Initiation of the Bend:** The bend originates from the upper spine, specifically just below the shoulder blades. The dancer lifts the chest towards the ceiling first, creating length in the spine before arching back. The lower back is supported by strong abdominal muscles and remains as long as possible.\n    *   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back without simply \"dropping.\" The arms, often in a high fifth position (en haut), open slightly to accommodate the backbend, but maintain their classical shape.\n    *   **Goal:** The primary goals are to develop controlled spinal flexibility and core strength while maintaining perfect alignment and stability in the lower body.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Core Principles:** The Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine in America, is known for its speed, musicality, extended lines, and dynamic, often off-balance movements.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Hip Placement:** This is the most distinct difference from the Vaganova method. In Balanchine style, the dancer pushes the hips **forward** as the upper body arches back. This acts as a counterbalance.\n    *   **Resulting Effect:** Pushing the hips forward allows for a deeper, more dramatic, and often quicker backbend. It creates a striking visual line and a sense of dynamic opposition in the body. This is a deliberate aesthetic choice that aligns with the style's emphasis on speed and extreme lines.\n    *   **Head and Arms:** The movement is often larger and more expansive. The head may be released further back, and the arms may open more widely to create a more dramatic shape.\n    *   **Goal:** The goal is to achieve a visually dynamic and extreme line that complements the fast-paced, musical choreography. The off-balance nature of the movement is an intended part of the aesthetic.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods based on the given answer choices.**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there may be stylistic nuances in the arms, this is not the primary, defining technical difference.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the fundamental, defining technical difference. Vaganova insists on stable, square hips, while Balanchine utilizes a forward push of the hips as a key part of the movement's mechanics and aesthetic.\n*   **C. Speed:** Balanchine choreography is generally faster, but a cambré in either technique can be performed at various speeds depending on the context of the exercise. The technical execution (hip placement) is a more constant difference than the tempo.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The Balanchine method often results in a deeper backbend, but this is a *consequence* of the hip placement. A Vaganova dancer with exceptional flexibility can also achieve a great degree of bend while maintaining proper technique. Therefore, the placement of the hips is the *cause*, making it the more fundamental difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement differs, often being more released in Balanchine, but this is a secondary detail that follows from the different mechanics of the spine and hips.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most critical and technically distinct difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the **placement of the hip**. This difference in pelvic alignment dictates the entire mechanic, feel, and look of the movement in each style.\n\n<<<B>>>"
