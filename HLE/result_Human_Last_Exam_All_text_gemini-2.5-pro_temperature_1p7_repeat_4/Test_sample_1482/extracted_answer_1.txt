The mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections of an Interval Type-3 Membership Function (IT3 MF) using a Gaussian paradigm defines the upper and lower membership bounds as a function of the secondary variable `u` for a fixed primary variable `x`. The vertical cross-section at `x` is an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Set whose bounds are given by:

1.  **Upper Bound of the Vertical Cross-Section:**
    $\bar{\mu}_{\tilde{\tilde{A}}}(x,u) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{u - c_u(x)}{\sigma_{u,U}(x)}\right)^2\right)$

2.  **Lower Bound of the Vertical Cross-Section:**
    $\underline{\mu}_{\tilde{\tilde{A}}}(x,u) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{u - c_u(x)}{\sigma_{u,L}(x)}\right)^2\right)$

Where the parameters are defined as follows:
*   $c_u(x) = \frac{\underline{\mu}_{ref}(x) + \bar{\mu}_{ref}(x)}{2}$ is the center of the vertical slice, determined by the lower and upper reference Type-1 Gaussian MFs, $\underline{\mu}_{ref}(x)$ and $\bar{\mu}_{ref}(x)$.
*   $\sigma_{u,U}(x)$ and $\sigma_{u,L}(x)$ are the upper and lower standard deviations for the Gaussian functions of `u`, defining the magnitude of uncertainty in the vertical slice at `x`. They are typically proportional to the width of the secondary domain, $\bar{\mu}_{ref}(x) - \underline{\mu}_{ref}(x)$.
