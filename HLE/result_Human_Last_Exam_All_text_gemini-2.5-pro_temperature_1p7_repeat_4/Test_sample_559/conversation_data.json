    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the system of differential equations and the phase plane.**\n    The system is given by:\n    $d'(t) = 2d(t)^2 + (-3u(t) + 5u(t)^2)d(t) - u(t)^3(1 - u(t))$\n    $u'(t) = u(t)^2(u(t) - 1)$\n    We denote $d=d(t)$ and $u=u(t)$. The system is:\n    $\\frac{dd}{dt} = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3$\n    $\\frac{du}{dt} = u^3 - u^2$\n    We are considering the phase plane $(u,d)$ for the region $u \\geq 0$. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of qualitatively different behavior. Separatrices are typically formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\n2.  **Find the equilibrium points.**\n    Equilibrium points are points $(u,d)$ where $\\frac{du}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{dd}{dt}=0$.\n    From $\\frac{du}{dt} = u^2(u - 1) = 0$, we find $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n    *   If $u=0$:\n        $\\frac{dd}{dt} = 2d^2 + 0 \\cdot d + 0 = 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n        So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n    *   If $u=1$:\n        $\\frac{dd}{dt} = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d + 1^4 - 1^3 = 2d^2 + 2d = 0$.\n        $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n        So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\n    The equilibrium points in the region $u \\ge 0$ are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points.**\n    We compute the Jacobian matrix of the system $J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial u'/\\partial u & \\partial u'/\\partial d \\\\ \\partial d'/\\partial u & \\partial d'/\\partial d \\end{pmatrix}$:\n    $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n    $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} = 0$\n    $\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} = (10u-3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2$\n    $\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n    $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   At $(1,0)$: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive real, $(1,0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n    *   At $(1,-1)$: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (7)(-1)+4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since they are real with opposite signs, $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n    *   At $(0,0)$: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive. This is a degenerate point.\n\n4.  **Find the manifolds of the saddle point.**\n    The separatrix is related to the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. A manifold is composed of trajectories that approach or leave the saddle point. Trajectories are solutions to the differential equation:\n    $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{dd/dt}{du/dt} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3}{u^3 - u^2}$\n    This is a Riccati equation for $d(u)$. If we can find a particular solution, finding the general solution is simplified. Let's test for a simple polynomial or rational function solution.\n\n5.  **Test for a particular solution.**\n    Let's try a solution of the form $d = a u^2 + b u + c$. Let's test a simple parabola passing through the origin, $d=cu^2$.\n    Let's test $d=-u^2$.\n    Then $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\n    We check if this satisfies the ODE:\n    LHS: $-2u$\n    RHS: $\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) + u^4 - u^3}{u^3 - u^2}$\n    $= \\frac{2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3}{u^2(u-1)}$\n    $= \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^3(u - 1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$.\n    Since LHS = RHS, $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution curve (a trajectory) of the system.\n\n6.  **Identify the separatrix.**\n    The curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the origin $(0,0)$. At $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2=-1$, so it also passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$. A trajectory that passes through a saddle point must be part of its stable or unstable manifold.\n    Let's determine which one by checking the slope at $(1,-1)$.\n    The slope of the curve $d=-u^2$ at $u=1$ is $\\frac{dd}{du}|_{u=1} = -2(1) = -2$.\n    Now let's find the slope of the manifolds from the eigenvectors of the Jacobian at $(1,-1)$.\n    $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   For the unstable manifold, we use the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$. The eigenvector $v_1 = (v_u, v_d)^T$ satisfies $(J-I)v_1=0$:\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$.\n        The eigenvector is proportional to $(1, -2)^T$. The slope of the unstable manifold at $(1,-1)$ is $v_d/v_u = -2$.\n    This matches the slope of the curve $d=-u^2$ at $(1,-1)$. Thus, the parabola $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n    *   For the stable manifold, we use the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$. The eigenvector $v_2 = (v_u, v_d)^T$ satisfies $(J+2I)v_2=0$:\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies 3v_u = 0 \\implies v_u=0$.\n        The eigenvector is proportional to $(0, 1)^T$. The stable manifold is tangent to the vertical line $u=1$. In fact, the line $u=1$ is an invariant line composed of trajectories.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a classic example of a separatrix, as it separates trajectories with different long-term behavior (often, different destinations as $t \\to -\\infty$). In this problem, the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ is the parabola $d=-u^2$.\n\nThe question asks for \"the\" separatrix, which strongly suggests a single curve. The unstable manifold of the saddle point, $d=-u^2$, is the most significant dividing curve originating from the non-degenerate saddle point.\n\nFinal answer is the equation of this curve."
