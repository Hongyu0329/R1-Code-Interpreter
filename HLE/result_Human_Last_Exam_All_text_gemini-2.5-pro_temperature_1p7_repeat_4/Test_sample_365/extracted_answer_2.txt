The product is the ketone formed from the anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement of the starting material. It has a bicyclo[7.3.0]dodecane (fused nine- and five-membered rings) skeleton, with a ketone in the nine-membered ring, a double bond in the five-membered ring, and the original ketal and TBS-ether groups intact. Its stereochemistry is determined by the stereospecificity of the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
