    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Definition of the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Green's function (or propagator) describes the propagation of a particle from one spacetime point to another. In the path integral formalism using imaginary time $\\tau$, the two-point Green's function for a system of non-interacting fermions is defined as the time-ordered expectation value of the field operators:\n\n$G_0(x_1, \\tau_1; x_2, \\tau_2) = -\\langle T_\\tau \\psi(x_1, \\tau_1) \\bar{\\psi}(x_2, \\tau_2) \\rangle_0$\n\nHere, $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ are Grassmann fields representing the fermions, $T_\\tau$ is the time-ordering operator, and the subscript '0' denotes that the average is taken with respect to the non-interacting action, $S_0$. The path integral expression is:\n\n$G_0(x_1, \\tau_1; x_2, \\tau_2) = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x_1, \\tau_1) \\bar{\\psi}(x_2, \\tau_2) \\, e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\n\n**Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action $S_0$ and the Single-Particle Hamiltonian $H_0$**\n\nThe \"bare\" or \"non-interacting\" nature of the system is encoded in the action $S_0$. This action is purely quadratic in the fields and contains the single-particle Hamiltonian, $H_0$:\n\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau) \\left( \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + H_0 \\right) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\n\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature and $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator whose eigenvalues are the single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$. (Note: We will set $\\hbar=1$ from now on. The chemical potential $\\mu$ can be included by replacing $H_0$ with $H_0 - \\mu N$, where $N$ is the particle number operator. For simplicity, we assume $\\epsilon_k$ already incorporates the chemical potential, i.e., $\\epsilon_k \\rightarrow \\epsilon_k - \\mu$).\n\nThe core task of finding the Green's function amounts to finding the inverse of the operator $\\mathcal{G}_0^{-1} = (\\partial_\\tau + H_0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalization of the Action**\n\nThe path integral is most easily evaluated in a basis where the operator $(\\partial_\\tau + H_0)$ is diagonal. This involves diagonalizing both the spatial part ($H_0$) and the imaginary-time derivative part ($\\partial_\\tau$) simultaneously.\n\n1.  **Diagonalizing $H_0$**: The Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal in its own eigenbasis. Let $\\{ |k\\rangle \\}$ be the set of eigenstates of $H_0$ with corresponding eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | k \\rangle$ and eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n    $H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Diagonalizing $\\partial_\\tau$**: The derivative operator $\\partial_\\tau$ is diagonalized by a Fourier transform with respect to the imaginary time variable $\\tau$. Due to the boundary conditions of the fields in imaginary time (anti-periodic for fermions), the frequencies are discrete Matsubara frequencies: $i\\omega_n = i\\pi(2n+1)/\\beta$, where $n$ is an integer.\n\nWe expand the Grassmann field $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ in this combined basis:\n\n$\\psi(x, \\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_{k,n} \\phi_k(x) \\, e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\, c_{k,n}$\n\nHere, $c_{k,n}$ are the Grassmann coefficients in the frequency-eigenstate basis.\n\n**Step 4: The Action in the Diagonal Basis**\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action $S_0$ and performing the integrations over $x$ and $\\tau$, the action becomes a simple sum, completely diagonal in the indices $k$ and $n$:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k) c_{k,n}$\n\nIn this basis, the operator $\\mathcal{G}_0^{-1}$ is no longer a differential operator but simply a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the complex numbers $(-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the Green's Function**\n\nThe Green's function in this frequency-eigenstate basis, $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$, corresponds to the expectation value $-\\langle c_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k,n} \\rangle_0$. For a quadratic Grassmann action of the form $S = \\sum_i \\bar{\\eta}_i M_i \\eta_i$, the two-point correlator is given by $\\langle \\eta_i \\bar{\\eta}_i \\rangle = M_i^{-1}$.\n\nApplying this to our action, the matrix element $M_{k,n}$ is $(-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k)$. The leading minus sign in the definition of $G_0$ cancels a minus sign that arises from the Grassmann integration, yielding:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nThis is the central result. It shows the bare Green's function in the frequency-eigenstate representation.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full Green's Function:** This result is strictly for the **bare** Green's function, $G_0$. In an interacting system, the full Green's function, $G$, is modified by the self-energy, $\\Sigma(k, i\\omega_n)$, through the Dyson equation: $G(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k, i\\omega_n)}$. The self-energy contains all the effects of particle-particle interactions.\n\n2.  **Meaning of the Index k:** The label 'k' represents the set of quantum numbers that define the eigenstates of the single-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$. For a free particle in continuous space, 'k' is the momentum vector, and $\\epsilon_k = \\hbar^2 k^2 / (2m)$. For electrons in a crystal, 'k' is the crystal momentum and $\\epsilon_k$ is the band dispersion. For an atom with discrete levels, 'k' would be a discrete index labeling those levels.\n\n3.  **Physical Interpretation:** The functional form $1/(i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k)$ has a profound physical meaning. After analytic continuation to real frequencies ($i\\omega_n \\to \\omega + i\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is a positive infinitesimal), the retarded Green's function becomes $G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$. This function has poles in the complex frequency plane precisely at the single-particle energies, $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - i\\delta$. The spectral function, $A(k, \\omega) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\text{Im} G_0^R(k, \\omega)$, becomes a delta function $\\delta(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$, indicating that the only possible excitation energy for a particle with quantum number 'k' is its single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n4.  **Conventions:** Different textbooks may use different conventions for the sign in the action or the definition of the Green's function, which can flip the sign of the entire expression or of $i\\omega_n$. However, the fundamental inverse relationship between $G_0$ and a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$ remains unchanged. The form $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = (i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$ is the most common convention.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$, when represented in the basis of single-particle energy eigenstates (labeled by quantum number $k$) and Matsubara frequencies ($i\\omega_n$), has a simple inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, it is the reciprocal of a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nThis expression shows that for a given Matsubara frequency, $G_0$ has a pole where the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is equal to $i\\omega_n$.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ in the frequency-eigenstate basis is inversely proportional to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. The explicit functional form is $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$.>>>"
