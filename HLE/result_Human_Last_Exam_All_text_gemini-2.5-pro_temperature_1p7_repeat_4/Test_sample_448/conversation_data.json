    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is also a noble gas but is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is not considered.\n\n2.  **Understand the Scope of the Question:** The question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to consider the total abundance of each gas on the entire planet, including the atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, and the oceans. The year \"2002\" is specified, but the relative abundances of these elements do not change on human timescales, so data from around that period or current data is valid. \"Rarest\" refers to the lowest total mass or number of atoms.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Abundance of Each Noble Gas:**\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** Argon is the third most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere (about 0.93% by volume). A significant portion of this is Argon-40, which is continuously produced in the Earth's crust by the radioactive decay of Potassium-40. Due to its high atmospheric concentration and crustal production, Argon is the most abundant noble gas on Earth and is not a candidate for the rarest.\n    *   **Helium (He):** Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, but it is relatively rare on Earth. Being very light, most of the primordial Helium escaped Earth's gravity long ago. However, it is continuously produced in the Earth's crust through the alpha decay of heavy radioactive elements like Uranium and Thorium. It gets trapped in natural gas reserves, making its total terrestrial abundance significant compared to the heavier noble gases.\n    *   **Neon (Ne), Krypton (Kr), and Xenon (Xe):** These gases are primarily primordial, meaning they have been present since the Earth's formation. They are too heavy to escape the atmosphere easily. Their abundance in the atmosphere decreases with increasing atomic mass: Neon (18 parts per million), Krypton (1 ppm), and Xenon (0.09 ppm). Of this group, Xenon is the rarest. The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is on the order of 10^12 kilograms.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Critical Contender: Radon (Rn):**\n    *   The key characteristic of Radon is that all of its isotopes are highly radioactive and have very short half-lives.\n    *   The most stable isotope is Radon-222, with a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n    *   Radon is not a primordial gas. It is continuously generated as a product in the radioactive decay chains of Uranium and Thorium, which are common in rocks and soil.\n    *   Because Radon decays so rapidly, it does not accumulate. It exists in a state of \"secular equilibrium,\" where its rate of decay is roughly equal to its rate of production. This results in an extremely small steady-state quantity present on Earth at any given moment.\n    *   Estimates place the total mass of Radon in the entire Earth's atmosphere at any one time at only about 20-30 kilograms. Even including the amount in the soil and oceans, the total amount on the planet at any instant is minuscule.\n\n5.  **Compare the Rarest Candidates: Xenon vs. Radon:**\n    *   **Total Mass of Xenon:** Primarily found in the atmosphere, with a total mass estimated to be around 2 x 10^12 kg (two trillion kilograms).\n    *   **Total Mass of Radon:** Exists transiently due to its short half-life, with a total global inventory at any moment estimated to be only a few tens of kilograms.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    When comparing the total amount present on Earth, the mass of Radon is many, many orders of magnitude less than the mass of Xenon. Therefore, Radon is the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n***\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Radon}$."
