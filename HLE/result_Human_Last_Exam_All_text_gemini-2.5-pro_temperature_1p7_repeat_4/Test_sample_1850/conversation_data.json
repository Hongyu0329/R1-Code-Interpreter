    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Define the Key Terms of the Question\n\n*   **\"How many\"**: The question requires a numerical answer.\n*   **\"Historical saints\"**: This is the most critical term to define. It has two components:\n    *   **\"Historical\"**: This implies figures who lived in the post-biblical era. While figures like Abraham, Moses, and the Apostles are historical, within the context of an epic poem rooted in the Bible, they are considered *biblical* figures. A \"historical\" figure would be someone from church history after the period covered by the New Testament.\n    *   **\"Saints\"**: This can mean a person formally canonized by a church (e.g., the Catholic or Orthodox Church) or, in the broader Protestant sense that Milton adhered to, any true believer or member of \"the elect.\" The question seems to point toward the former—specific, named individuals known to history as saints—as the latter would be an innumerable and anonymous group (\"the assembly of the saints\").\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The individual's name must appear explicitly in the text. Allusions to figures or descriptions of groups are not sufficient.\n*   **\"In Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: The answer must be found exclusively within the text of this specific epic poem.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Locations in the Text\n\nMilton's epic is vast, but mentions of post-biblical figures would logically be concentrated in specific sections where the poem looks forward in time from its biblical setting:\n\n1.  **Book III (The \"Limbo of Vanity\")**: In this section, Milton describes a \"limbo large and broad\" where foolish and vain things end up. He uses this as a vehicle for satire, particularly against the Roman Catholic Church. This is a possible place to find names.\n2.  **Books XI and XII (Michael's Prophecy)**: The Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of future human history, from his own children to the Second Coming. This prophecy covers biblical history and extends to the history of the Church. This is the most likely section to contain names of historical figures.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Potential Locations for Named Saints\n\n1.  **Analysis of Book III**:\n    *   Milton describes the inhabitants of the Limbo of Vanity, including \"Eremites and Friars, / White, Black, and Grey, with all their trumpery.\" This is a clear jab at monastic orders like the Carmelites, Dominicans, and Franciscans. However, he **does not name** their founders (St. Simon Stock, St. Dominic, St. Francis). He criticizes the groups, not the named individuals.\n    *   He mentions classical figures who end up there (\"Empedocles,\" \"Cleombrotus\") and contemporary figures (\"Galileo,\" the \"Tuscan Artist,\" is mentioned elsewhere), but these are philosophers and scientists, not saints.\n    *   He satirizes Catholic relics and practices, but again, without naming the saints associated with them.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Books XI and XII**:\n    *   Michael's vision is a long catalogue of figures. He explicitly names many *biblical* figures: **Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Nimrod, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, Solomon,** and refers to the **Apostles** as a group (and Peter and Paul by implication, though their post-biblical \"saint\" names aren't used).\n    *   When the prophecy moves beyond the apostolic age into the history of the institutional church, Milton's language becomes general and allegorical. He speaks of \"grievous Wolves\" who will enter the flock and \"turn the truth of God into a lie.\" This is a strong critique of the perceived corruption of the church, especially its alliance with state power under emperors like Constantine.\n    *   Crucially, **Milton does not name Constantine.** He refers to the event (\"then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, / Places, and titles, and with these to join / Secular power\"), but not the person.\n    *   Similarly, he does not name any of the Church Fathers (like Augustine, Jerome, or Ambrose), nor any Popes or later saints.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Findings and List Careful Points\n\n*   **Crucial Point 1: Milton's Protestantism.** As a radical Protestant, Milton was deeply hostile to the Catholic concept of sainthood and the veneration of saints. It is highly unlikely he would name a Catholic saint in a neutral or positive way, and when he criticizes the church, he does so by attacking institutions and practices rather than specific, named post-biblical individuals.\n*   **Crucial Point 2: Biblical vs. Historical.** The poem is filled with named *biblical* figures whom later tradition calls saints (e.g., \"Saint Peter\"), but it contains no named figures who are exclusively *historical* saints from the post-biblical era.\n*   **Crucial Point 3: The Search for Evidence.** A direct search of the text of *Paradise Lost* for the names of major historical saints (Augustine, Francis, Dominic, Constantine, Athanasius, etc.) yields no results.\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on a thorough analysis of the text and an understanding of Milton's theology and purpose, he mentions many biblical figures but deliberately avoids naming any post-biblical, historical saints.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost* is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
