    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The user is asking for the earliest specific calendar date that has been found written down in a native, pre-Columbian script in the Americas.\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\"**: We are looking for a specific, identifiable point in history, not a repeating day name.\n    *   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact (stone, pottery, etc.).\n    *   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed before 1492. The earliest dates will come from much older civilizations like the Olmec, Zapotec, or Maya.\n    *   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The script must be indigenous to the Americas, not one introduced by Europeans.\n\n2.  **Identifying Candidate Civilizations and Writing Systems:** Several Mesoamerican civilizations developed sophisticated writing and calendar systems.\n    *   **Zapotecs:** At San José Mogote, an inscribed monument (Monument 3) shows the glyph \"1 Earthquake.\" While this is an very early example of writing (c. 600 BCE), it is a day name from the 260-day ritual calendar. It is a recurring name, not a unique, non-repeating historical date. Therefore, it does not fully answer the question of a specific recorded date.\n    *   **Maya:** The Maya are famous for their Long Count calendar, which tracks the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). This system allows for the recording of unique, absolute dates.\n    *   **Epi-Olmec / Izapan:** These are cultures that followed the Olmec and preceded the Classic Maya. They also used a Long Count calendar system and inscribed dates on monuments. It is from these cultures that the earliest known dated artifacts come.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Key Artifacts:** The earliest known absolute dates are found on stone monuments (stelae) that use the Long Count calendar system. The two primary contenders for the \"earliest\" are:\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** Discovered in Veracruz, Mexico, this epi-Olmec monument has a Long Count date inscribed on one side using a bar-and-dot numbering system. The date is **7.16.6.16.18**.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this monument is attributed to the Izapan culture. It is fragmented but contains a legible Long Count date: **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Dates:** To determine which is earlier, we must compare the Long Count dates. The Long Count is a positional system (like our own decimal system), with the largest time periods on the left. We only need to compare the numbers from left to right.\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo date: **7.16.3.2.13**\n    *   Tres Zapotes date: **7.16.6.16.18**\n\n    Both dates have a \"7\" in the first position (the *baktun*) and a \"16\" in the second position (the *katun*). The difference appears in the third position (the *tun*). Chiapa de Corzo has a \"3,\" while Tres Zapotes has a \"6.\" Since 3 is less than 6, the Chiapa de Corzo date is the earlier one.\n\n5.  **Converting to the Modern Calendar:** Using the standard GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation, these Long Count dates can be converted to the Gregorian calendar for easier understanding.\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (7.16.3.2.13) correlates to **December 7, 36 BCE**.\n    *   Tres Zapotes Stela C (7.16.6.16.18) correlates to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n\n    This conversion confirms that the date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is approximately four years earlier than the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between a repeating calendar name (like \"1 Earthquake\") and a specific, non-repeating date recorded in the Long Count system. The question asks for the latter.\n*   The term \"earliest known\" is important. It is always possible that an earlier dated artifact exists but has not yet been discovered or has been destroyed. The answer is based on current archaeological evidence.\n*   The Gregorian calendar conversion depends on the use of a correlation constant (the GMT constant), which is the most widely accepted but still a subject of some academic debate. However, the relative order of the dates remains the same regardless of the correlation used.\n*   The script on these early monuments is not Classic Maya script but a precursor, often called Isthmian or Epi-Olmec.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on current archaeological evidence, the earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is the Long Count date found on Stela 2 from the site of Chiapa de Corzo in Mexico.\n\n<<<The earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is December 7, 36 BCE. This date, written in the Long Count calendar as 7.16.3.2.13, was found inscribed on Stela 2 at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo, in Chiapas, Mexico.>>>"
