    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  The first clue is the author Andrei Voznesensky. He was a famous Soviet and Russian poet. This suggests the subject of the question is likely a figure from Russian or Soviet history.\n2.  The second clue is the description \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and the quote \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This points to a specific poem or work by Voznesensky about a historical figure who was an explorer or sailor and whose burial site was unknown at the time the poem was written.\n3.  Voznesensky is most famously associated with the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This work is based on a real historical event.\n4.  The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian courtier, diplomat, and explorer Nikolai Rezanov. In the early 19th century, he led a maritime expedition to Russian America (Alaska) and California. His story involves a famous romance with Concepción Argüello in California. Thus, the description \"sailor\" fits perfectly.\n5.  The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" directly relates to Nikolai Rezanov's fate. He died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on his way back to St. Petersburg. He was buried at the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, during the Soviet era, the cathedral and the cemetery were destroyed, and the exact location of his grave was lost for many decades.\n6.  The final clue is that \"the answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" Historical records show that during the Perestroika period in the late 1980s, there was a renewed interest in Rezanov's story. Research and archaeological efforts to locate his lost grave intensified, and information about its probable location was rediscovered and publicized, effectively \"answering\" the question from Voznesensky's poem. A memorial was later erected on the site.\n\nCareful Points:\n*   The description \"joy-discovering sailor\" is a poetic interpretation of Rezanov's character as portrayed in \"Juno and Avos\"—a passionate man on a voyage of discovery who found unexpected love.\n*   The loss and subsequent rediscovery of the grave's location is a key historical fact that directly matches the details in the question.\n*   The timeline provided (late 1980s) corresponds with the period of renewed historical inquiry in the Soviet Union that brought Rezanov's story and the mystery of his grave back into the public eye.\n\nConclusion:\nBy connecting Andrei Voznesensky's famous work \"Juno and Avos\" with the historical details of its protagonist, Nikolai Rezanov, all parts of the question are answered. The man in question is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
