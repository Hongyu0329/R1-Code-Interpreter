    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** The question is set in the context of the renormalization group (RG) theory and asks for a critical exponent, specifically the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$. The method to be used is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion.\n\n2.  **Define the system and its universality class:** The problem refers to a general system with spatial dimension $d=3$. Critical exponents are universal, meaning they depend on the spatial dimension $d$ and the symmetries of the system (captured by the number of components of the order parameter, $N$), but not on the microscopic details. The epsilon expansion is typically applied to the $O(N)$ vector model. For questions about standard critical phenomena without further specification, it is conventional to assume the Ising universality class, which corresponds to a scalar order parameter ($N=1$).\n\n3.  **Identify the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative technique performed around the upper critical dimension, $d_c$. This is the dimension above which the critical exponents take their classical, mean-field theory values. For the $O(N)$ model (and thus for the Ising model), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n\n4.  **Define the Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$):** The expansion parameter is defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension: $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n    Given $d_c = 4$ and the target dimension $d=3$, the expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n    It is important to note that the epsilon expansion is formally valid for small $\\epsilon$. Setting $\\epsilon=1$ is an extrapolation, but it often provides a reasonable first estimate for exponents in three dimensions.\n\n5.  **State the Formula for the Exponent $\\alpha$:** Within the RG framework, one can calculate the critical exponents as a power series in $\\epsilon$. To the first order in $\\epsilon$ (one-loop approximation), the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ for the $O(N)$ model is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\alpha = \\frac{4 - N}{2(N + 8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n\n6.  **Calculate $\\alpha$ for the Ising Model ($N=1$):** We substitute $N=1$ into the general formula:\n    $$ \\alpha = \\frac{4 - 1}{2(1 + 8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n    $$ \\alpha = \\frac{3}{2 \\times 9}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n    $$ \\alpha = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n    This expression gives the exponent $\\alpha$ to the leading order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n7.  **Evaluate for $d=3$ (i.e., $\\epsilon=1$):** To obtain the estimate for the three-dimensional system, we substitute $\\epsilon=1$ into the first-order result:\n    $$ \\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Universality Class Assumption:** The calculation relies on the assumption of the Ising ($N=1$) universality class. For other models like the XY model ($N=2$) or the Heisenberg model ($N=3$), the numerical value of $\\alpha$ would be different.\n*   **Approximation Nature:** The epsilon expansion is an asymptotic series. Truncating at the first order and extrapolating to $\\epsilon=1$ is an approximation. Higher-order terms exist and would modify the result.\n*   **Consistency with Scaling Relations:** There are famous scaling relations connecting the critical exponents (e.g., the hyperscaling relation $2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$). When using the epsilon expansion, one must be careful. The scaling relations hold true order by order in $\\epsilon$ if $d$ is treated as $4-\\epsilon$. If one computes $\\nu$ to first order in $\\epsilon$, evaluates it at $\\epsilon=1$, and then uses the scaling relation with $d=3$ to find $\\alpha$, a different result ($\\alpha = 1/4$) is obtained. The procedure followed here—directly calculating the series for $\\alpha$ in $\\epsilon$ and then evaluating—is the most straightforward and common interpretation for a \"first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion result\".\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the standard one-loop RG formula for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ in the Ising universality class ($N=1$). The upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$, so for $d=3$, the expansion parameter is $\\epsilon=1$. The first-order expansion for $\\alpha$ is $\\frac{(4-N)\\epsilon}{2(N+8)}$. Substituting $N=1$ and $\\epsilon=1$ yields $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
