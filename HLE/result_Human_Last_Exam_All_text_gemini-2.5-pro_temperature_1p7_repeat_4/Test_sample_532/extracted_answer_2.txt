The finite filled nilpotent groups are the finite abelian groups `G` such that for every odd prime `p`, the Sylow `p`-subgroup of `G` is either trivial or cyclic of order `p`. Equivalently, they are groups of the form `A \times K` where `A` is an arbitrary finite abelian 2-group and `K` is a cyclic group of square-free odd order.
