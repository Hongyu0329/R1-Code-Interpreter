    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the goal**\n\nThe problem asks for two things:\na) Find the number of stable equilibrium points, denoted by $m$, for the given differential equation.\nb) Calculate the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**2. Analyze the differential equation**\n\nThe given autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\nLet's denote the right-hand side as $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n\n**3. Find the equilibrium points**\n\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the system is in a state of rest, meaning $x'(t) = 0$. So we need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $\n\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$ -x(x - 1)^2 = 0 $\n\nThis equation has two solutions, which are our equilibrium points:\n*   $x = 0$\n*   $x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**4. Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, i.e., $f'(x^*)$.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is **stable**.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is **unstable**.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use other methods, such as a phase line analysis or higher-order derivatives.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x = 1$.\n    Recall that $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n    - **For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$):**\n      $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9 - 1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009$.\n      Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, and the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from 1.\n    - **For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$):**\n      $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1 - 1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011$.\n      Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, and the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards 1.\n\n    Because solutions on one side of $x=1$ move away from it, while solutions on the other side move towards it, the equilibrium point $x = 1$ is classified as **semi-stable**. A semi-stable point is not a stable point.\n\n**5. Count the number of stable equilibrium points (m)**\n\nBased on our analysis, only one equilibrium point, $x=0$, is stable.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**6. Calculate the final expression**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n<<<$1 - 2^{4048}$>>>"
