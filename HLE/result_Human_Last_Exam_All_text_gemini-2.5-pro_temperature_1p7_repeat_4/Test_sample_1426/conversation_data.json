    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific musical work and section:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\". The specific location is the very end of the work, and the instrument in question is the first violin.\n\n2.  **Consult the musical score:** To find the notes, we must look at the full orchestral score. The symphony has four movements, so we need to find the final measures of the 4th movement (Allegro con fuoco).\n\n3.  **Locate the First Violin part:** Within the score, we find the staff labeled \"Violino I\" (First Violin).\n\n4.  **Examine the final measure:** At the very end of the symphony, the entire orchestra comes together for a powerful concluding chord. In the final bar, the first violins are instructed to play a triple stop, which is a chord of three notes played simultaneously on the single instrument. These are the \"three notes\" the question refers to.\n\n5.  **Identify the three notes:** The three notes written for the first violins in this final chord are:\n    *   B-flat (Bb)\n    *   D\n    *   F\n\n    These three notes together form the tonic B-flat major chord, which is the home key of the symphony.\n\n6.  **Determine the lowest note:** By comparing the pitches of these three notes (B-flat, D, and F), we can identify the lowest one. In any standard B-flat major chord, B-flat is the root and the lowest-pitched note of the triad when in root position. In the score, the B-flat (specifically Bb4) is written lowest on the staff for the first violins' final chord.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three final notes played by the first violins are B-flat, D, and F, played together as a chord. The lowest of these three notes is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
