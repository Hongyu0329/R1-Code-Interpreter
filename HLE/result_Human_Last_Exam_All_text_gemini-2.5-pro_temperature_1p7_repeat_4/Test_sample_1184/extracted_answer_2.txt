1) **Interaction Hotspots:** The exact residues in the human beta-1 subunit (Cavβ1) that form the core binding site for the alpha-1 subunit are located within its Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain. These residues create a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit. The key residues are:
*   Tyrosine 243 (Y243)
*   Leucine 279 (L279)
*   Leucine 281 (L281)
*   Serine 291 (S291)
*   Phenylalanine 317 (F317)
*   Isoleucine 319 (I319)
*   Valine 324 (V324)
*   Tryptophan 348 (W348)
*   Valine 371 (V371)
*   Leucine 388 (L388)

2) **Gating Modulation Hotspots:** The fine-tuning of the alpha-1 subunit's gating properties is governed by distinct domains on the beta-1 subunit that function allosterically. Rather than single residues, these are functional regions:
*   **N-terminal Domain (approx. residues 1-30):** This region is a primary hotspot for modulating inactivation. For the Cavβ1 subunit, this domain acts as a module to accelerate the speed of channel inactivation.
*   **HOOK Domain (approx. residues 186-216):** This linker region between the SH3 and GK domains is crucial for influencing the voltage-dependence and kinetics of channel activation. Its unique sequence and length are key determinants of the Cavβ1-specific modulatory effects.
