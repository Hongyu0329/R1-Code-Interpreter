    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff topological space. The parenthetical remark \"(not necessarily metric)\" is crucial, as it broadens the scope beyond the more commonly studied metric spaces.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a closed, connected subset of $X$, and \"proper\" means it is not equal to $X$ itself.\n*   **Composant:** For any point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. The collection of all distinct composants forms a partition of $X$.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing a Lower Bound for the Number of Composants\n\nWe need to determine the minimum number of composants for a continuum that is indecomposable. Let's first consider the case of a decomposable continuum.\n\n*   If a continuum $X$ is decomposable, it can be written as $X = A \\cup B$, where $A$ and $B$ are proper subcontinua. One can show that in this case, $X$ has only **one** composant, which is $X$ itself. Every point can be connected to every other point via a proper subcontinuum (though not necessarily the same one for all pairs).\n\nNow, let's consider an indecomposable continuum.\n\n*   Could an indecomposable continuum have only one composant? If a continuum $X$ has only one composant, this means that for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both. Such a continuum is called *biconnected*.\n*   A fundamental theorem by Knaster and Kuratowski states that **every biconnected continuum is decomposable**.\n*   Therefore, an indecomposable continuum cannot be biconnected. This means there must exist at least one pair of points, say $p$ and $q$, that are not contained in any common proper subcontinuum.\n*   If such a pair $(p,q)$ exists, then by definition, $q$ is not in the composant of $p$, $C(p)$, and $p$ is not in the composant of $q$, $C(q)$. This implies that $C(p)$ and $C(q)$ are distinct composants.\n*   This proves that any indecomposable continuum must have at least **two** composants.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Number of Composants in Known Cases\n\nNow that we have a lower bound of 2, we must ask if this minimum is achievable.\n\n*   **Metric Case:** For the more familiar class of *metric* continua, a famous theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1920) states that **every indecomposable metric continuum has uncountably many composants**. Specifically, it has $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants. Famous examples like the pseudo-arc, solenoids, and the Knaster bucket-handle continuum all have $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants. If the problem were restricted to metric spaces, the answer would be $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n*   **Non-Metric Case:** The question explicitly includes non-metric spaces. This is the key to finding a smaller number. The result for metric spaces does not necessarily hold in this more general setting. We need to know if a non-metric indecomposable continuum can be constructed with a finite number of composants.\n\n### Step 4: Finding an Example That Achieves the Lower Bound\n\nThe question now boils down to whether there exists an indecomposable (non-metric) continuum with exactly 2 composants.\n\n*   This was a known problem in general topology. It was solved in 1961 by the Polish mathematician **Jan Mioduszewski**.\n*   In his paper \"An indecomposable non-metric continuum with exactly two composants\" (Colloquium Mathematicum, Vol. 8, 1961), Mioduszewski provided an explicit construction of such a space.\n*   The existence of this space demonstrates that the lower bound of 2 is indeed achievable.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. The minimum possible number is therefore at least 2.\n2.  While all indecomposable *metric* continua have uncountably many ($\\mathfrak{c}$) composants, the same is not true for all continua in general.\n3.  A specific construction by J. Mioduszewski provides an example of a *non-metric* indecomposable continuum that has exactly 2 composants.\n4.  Since the number of composants must be at least 2, and an example with exactly 2 exists, the smallest possible number is 2.\n\nThe smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
