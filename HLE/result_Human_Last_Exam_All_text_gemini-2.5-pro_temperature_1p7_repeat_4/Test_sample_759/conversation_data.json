    "Answering this question requires finding the minimum number of edges `e` in a simple, connected graph `γ` whose automorphism group `Aut(γ)` has an order of 3.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Automorphism Group**:\n    *   The order of the automorphism group is $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$. Since 3 is a prime number, this group must be the cyclic group of order 3, denoted $C_3$.\n    *   This means there exists a non-identity automorphism $\\sigma$ such that $\\sigma^3 = id$ (the identity permutation), and the automorphism group is $\\{id, \\sigma, \\sigma^2\\}$.\n\n2.  **Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem**:\n    *   The group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ acts on the set of vertices $V$ and the set of edges $E$.\n    *   According to the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the size of any orbit must divide the order of the group. So, the vertex orbits and edge orbits can only have sizes 1 or 3.\n    *   A vertex or edge is in an orbit of size 1 if and only if it is fixed by every automorphism in the group.\n    *   If all vertices were in orbits of size 1 (i.e., all vertices are fixed), the only automorphism would be the identity, and the group order would be 1, not 3. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex orbit of size 3. This implies the graph must have at least 3 vertices.\n    *   Similarly, if all edges were fixed, they would have to connect pairs of fixed vertices. This would mean all vertices involved are fixed, leading to the same contradiction. So, there must be at least one edge orbit of size 3.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Edge Orbits**:\n    *   An edge $\\{u,v\\}$ is fixed by $\\sigma$ if $\\{\\sigma(u), \\sigma(v)\\} = \\{u,v\\}$. Since $\\sigma$ is of order 3, it cannot swap $u$ and $v$ (as that would mean $\\sigma$ has order 2). Thus, for an edge to be fixed, its vertices must also be fixed: $\\sigma(u)=u$ and $\\sigma(v)=v$.\n    *   This means any edge in an orbit of size 1 (a fixed edge) must connect two fixed vertices.\n    *   The total number of edges $e$ is the sum of the sizes of the edge orbits. So, $e = k \\cdot 1 + m \\cdot 3$, where $k$ is the number of fixed-edge orbits and $m$ is the number of 3-edge orbits.\n    *   If a graph has fixed vertices and moving vertices, for it to be connected, there must be edges connecting fixed vertices to moving vertices. An edge $\\{u, v\\}$ with $u$ fixed and $v$ in a 3-orbit $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ must belong to a 3-edge orbit: $\\{\\{u, v_1\\}, \\{u, v_2\\}, \\{u, v_3\\}\\}$.\n    *   A simple graph with 3-fold symmetry that contains fixed edges tends to have larger automorphism groups (like $S_3$) or requires many vertices and edges to break the unwanted symmetries. It's more plausible that the minimal graph has no fixed vertices or edges, meaning $k=0$ and $e$ is a multiple of 3.\n\n4.  **Searching for the Smallest `e`**:\n\n    *   **Case e=3**: The graph must consist of a single edge orbit of size 3. The two possibilities for an edge set of size 3 that can form an orbit under a 3-fold rotation are:\n        *   Three disjoint edges. This graph is not connected.\n        *   A cycle of length 3 ($C_3$). The automorphism group of $C_3$ is the dihedral group $D_3$ (or $S_3$), which has order 6, not 3.\n        So, $e=3$ is not possible.\n\n    *   **Case e=6**: The graph must consist of two edge orbits of size 3. Let's explore constructions.\n        *   **No fixed points**: Smallest vertex count is $|V|=6$, with two vertex orbits $V_1=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$ and $V_2=\\{u_1,u_2,u_3\\}$. Edge sets can be formed by taking orbits of edges within or between these vertex sets. Common constructions include:\n            1.  A $C_3$ on $V_1$ and another $C_3$ on $V_2$. This graph is disconnected.\n            2.  A $C_3$ on $V_1$ and edges connecting $v_i$ to \"leaves\" $u_i$. This creates a graph where any automorphism of the $C_3$ extends to the whole graph, leading to $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$. Whether the leaves are attached \"straight\" ($\\{v_i, u_i\\}$) or \"twisted\" ($\\{v_i, u_{i+1}\\}$), the automorphism group is still $S_3$ of order 6.\n            3.  A $C_6$ formed by alternating vertices from $V_1$ and $V_2$. The automorphism group of $C_6$ is $D_6$, of order 12.\n        *   **With fixed points**: Smallest vertex count is $|V|=7$ (one fixed vertex $v_0$ and two 3-orbits $V_1, V_2$). We need two 3-edge orbits. A common attempt is connecting $v_0$ to all of $V_1$ (one orbit) and $V_1$ to $V_2$ (second orbit). This again leads to an automorphism group of order 6 because the structure is too symmetric.\n        After checking all simple cases, it appears no graph with $e=6$ has $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\n\n    *   **Case e=9**: The graph must consist of three edge orbits of size 3. Let's try to construct such a graph. We need to introduce enough asymmetry to eliminate reflective symmetries while preserving the 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n        *   **Construction**: Consider a graph with no fixed points, built on two vertex orbits $V_1=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$ and $V_2=\\{u_1,u_2,u_3\\}$. Let the automorphism $\\sigma$ act as a 3-cycle on both orbits simultaneously (i.e., $\\sigma(v_i)=v_{i+1}$ and $\\sigma(u_i)=u_{i+1}$, indices modulo 3). We define the edge set using three orbits:\n            1.  **Orbit 1 ($E_1$)**: A cycle on $V_1$. Edges: $\\{\\{v_1,v_2\\}, \\{v_2,v_3\\}, \\{v_3,v_1\\}\\}$.\n            2.  **Orbit 2 ($E_2$)**: \"Straight\" connections between $V_1$ and $V_2$. Edges: $\\{\\{v_1,u_1\\}, \\{v_2,u_2\\}, \\{v_3,u_3\\}\\}$.\n            3.  **Orbit 3 ($E_3$)**: \"Twisted\" connections between $V_1$ and $V_2$. Edges: $\\{\\{v_1,u_2\\}, \\{v_2,u_3\\}, \\{v_3,u_1\\}\\}$.\n        *   **Analysis of this graph**:\n            *   Total edges $e = |E_1|+|E_2|+|E_3| = 3+3+3 = 9$.\n            *   The graph is connected.\n            *   Let's check the vertex degrees. $\\deg(v_i)=4$ for all $i$ (2 in the cycle, 2 to $V_2$). $\\deg(u_i)=2$ for all $i$ (one straight, one twisted connection from $V_1$).\n            *   Any automorphism must preserve the degree partition, so it must map $V_1 \\to V_1$ and $V_2 \\to V_2$. Let an automorphism be defined by permutations $\\pi$ on the indices of $V_1$ and $\\rho$ on the indices of $V_2$.\n            *   Preservation of $E_2$ implies that if $\\{v_i, u_i\\}$ is an edge, then $\\{v_{\\pi(i)}, u_{\\rho(i)}\\}$ must be an edge. This forces $\\rho(i)=\\pi(i)$, so $\\pi=\\rho$.\n            *   Preservation of $E_3$ implies that if $\\{v_i, u_{i+1}\\}$ is an edge, then $\\{v_{\\pi(i)}, u_{\\rho(i+1)}\\}$ must be an edge. Using $\\pi=\\rho$, this becomes $\\{v_{\\pi(i)}, u_{\\pi(i+1)}\\}$. This new edge must be of the form $\\{v_k, u_{k+1}\\}$. This holds if $\\pi(i+1) = \\pi(i)+1$ (indices mod 3). This condition means $\\pi$ must be a rotation.\n            *   The permutations that are rotations form the group $C_3 = \\{id, (123), (132)\\}$. These are also automorphisms of the cycle $E_1$.\n            *   Therefore, the automorphism group is precisely $C_3$, which has order 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that $e=3$ and $e=6$ are not possible. We have constructed a simple, connected graph with $e=9$ edges whose automorphism group has order 3. Since the number of edges is likely a multiple of 3, and smaller multiples have been ruled out, 9 is the smallest such number."
