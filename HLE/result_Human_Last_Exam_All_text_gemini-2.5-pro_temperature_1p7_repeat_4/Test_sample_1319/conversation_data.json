    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the second tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify all historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.**\nThe question requires us to find real, geographical mountains that are explicitly named in Homer's epic poem, the *Iliad*.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The most famous mountain in the *Iliad*, serving as the home of the gods. It is the highest mountain in Greece.\n*   **Mount Ida (near Troy):** This mountain is frequently mentioned. Zeus, in particular, observes the Trojan War from its summit, Gargarus (*Iliad* 8.48, 14.283). This corresponds to the modern Kaz Dağı in Turkey.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** Poseidon watches the battle from the \"topmost peak of wooded Samothrace\" (*Iliad* 13.11-13). This refers to the peak Fengari on the Greek island of Samothrace.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In her journey to deceive Zeus, Hera flies from Olympus over several landmarks, including Mount Athos (*Iliad* 14.229). This is the prominent mountain on the Athos peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** The great spear of Achilles was cut from an ash tree on the summit of Mount Pelion (*Iliad* 16.143, 19.390). This is a mountain in Thessaly, Greece, near Mount Olympus.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain is mentioned as the home of the nymphs who were the mothers of the Trojan leaders Mesthles and Antiphus (*Iliad* 2.864-866). It is also mentioned as a landmark Apollo passes (*Iliad* 20.385). This corresponds to the modern Bozdağ mountain range in Lydia, Turkey.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Distinguishing between mentioned and unmentioned mountains.**\nSome mountains, famous in Greek mythology, are not actually mentioned by name in the *Iliad*. For instance, **Mount Parnassus**, home to the Delphic Oracle, is not named in the *Iliad* (though places at its foot are). Likewise, the **Mount Ida on Crete**, famous as the birthplace of Zeus, is not the Ida referenced in the *Iliad*; all references point to the Trojan Ida. Therefore, Parnassus and Cretan Ida must be excluded from our list.\n\n**Step 2: Find the modern elevations of these mountains.**\nTo determine the tallest, we need their real-world heights.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus (Greece):** ~2,918 meters (9,573 feet)\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ, Turkey):** ~2,157 meters (7,077 feet)\n*   **Mount Athos (Greece):** ~2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** ~1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** ~1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari, Greece):** ~1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n**Careful Point 2: Ensuring accuracy of elevations.**\nElevations are based on modern geographical surveys. Minor variations exist in reported heights, but they do not affect the relative ranking of these specific mountains.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the mountains by height to find the second tallest.**\nNow we arrange the mountains from tallest to shortest to answer the question.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 m\n2.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,157 m\n3.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n4.  **Mount Ida (Trojan):** 1,774 m\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n6.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Olympus. The second tallest is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
