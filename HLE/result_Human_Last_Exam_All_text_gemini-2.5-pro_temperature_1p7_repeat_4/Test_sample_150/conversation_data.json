    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the submitted code.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Analysis\nThe problem asks us to calculate the final value of a variable `x`, which starts at 0. We are given `n` statements that modify `x`. There are two operations:\n*   `++`: Increments `x` by 1.\n*   `--`: Decrements `x` by 1.\n\nThese operations are part of a 3-character statement that also includes the character 'X'. The problem states that \"The operation and the variable can be written in any order.\" This means there are four possible valid statement formats:\n1.  `++X` (pre-increment)\n2.  `X++` (post-increment)\n3.  `--X` (pre-decrement)\n4.  `X--` (post-decrement)\n\nThe goal is to process all `n` statements and output the final value of `x`.\n\n### Step 2: Submitted Program Analysis\nThe provided Java code attempts to solve this problem. Let's analyze its logic:\n1.  It reads the number of statements `t`.\n2.  It initializes a result variable `tresult` (representing `x`) to 0.\n3.  It loops `t` times. In each iteration, it reads a statement string `test`.\n4.  It checks `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))` to handle increments.\n5.  It checks `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))` to handle decrements.\n\n**Careful Point / Flaw:** The code only checks for the strings `++X` and `--X`. It completely ignores the other two valid formats, `X++` and `X--`. If the input contains a statement like `X++`, the code will not perform any operation for that statement, leading to an incorrect final result. Therefore, the submitted program **does not solve the problem correctly**.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer\nSince the program is incorrect, the answer must start with `N`. We now need to determine the values for `x` (smallest number of character comparisons for 100 instructions) and `y` (smallest memory size in Bytes) for an optimal C program.\n\n#### Optimal C Algorithm\nAn efficient C program would not compare the entire string. It would leverage a key observation about the input format. In all four valid statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`), the character at index 1 is guaranteed to be an operator symbol (`+` or `-`).\n\n*   For `++X` and `X++`, the character `s[1]` is `+`.\n*   For `--X` and `X--`, the character `s[1]` is `-`.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient logic is to read the statement and check only the character at index 1.\n\n#### `x`: Smallest Number of Character Comparisons\n*   **Input:** 100 instructions.\n*   **Logic:** For each instruction, we perform a single comparison: `if (character == '+')`.\n*   **Total:** For 100 instructions, this requires exactly **100** character comparisons. It's impossible to do fewer, as we must inspect at least one character per instruction to determine the operation.\n*   So, **x = 100**.\n\n#### `y`: Smallest Memory Size\nWe need to design the C program using the smallest possible data types for its variables, based on the problem constraints (\"at most 100 instructions\").\n\n1.  **Variable for `n` (number of statements):** Since `n <= 100`, an `unsigned char` (1 byte) is sufficient.\n2.  **Variable for `x` (the result):** `x` will be between -100 and +100. This range fits perfectly into a `signed char` (1 byte, range -128 to 127).\n3.  **Loop counter:** The loop runs from 0 to 99. An `unsigned char` (1 byte) is sufficient.\n4.  **Input Reading:** Instead of using a 4-byte character array to store the string, we can read character by character with `getchar()`. We only need to store the middle character to check it. This requires a single `char` variable (1 byte).\n\nThe total memory required for variables is the sum of their sizes:\n*   `n`: 1 byte\n*   `x`: 1 byte\n*   loop counter `i`: 1 byte\n*   temporary char `op`: 1 byte\n*   Total Memory (`y`) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 bytes**.\n\n#### Final Answer Formulation\n*   The program is incorrect: **N**\n*   Smallest character comparisons `x`: **100**\n*   Smallest memory size `y`: **4**\n*   The final answer in the format `Nx+y` is `N100+4`.\n\n<<<N100+4>>>"
