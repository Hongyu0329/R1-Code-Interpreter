    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine its Rank\n\n1.  **Flag Description:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross consists of a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe, both of which extend to the edges of the flag.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** To analyze the flag using linear algebra, we represent it as a matrix. Per the user's request, we assign different numerical values to different colors to maximize the rank. Let's assign Red = 1 and White = 2.\n3.  **Rank Calculation:** The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's model a simplified version of the flag as a matrix:\n    ```\n    1 1 2 1 1  (A row intersecting the vertical part of the cross)\n    1 1 2 1 1\n    2 2 2 2 2  (The horizontal part of the cross)\n    1 1 2 1 1\n    1 1 2 1 1\n    ```\n4.  **Row Analysis:** We can identify two distinct types of rows in this matrix:\n    *   Type A (field with vertical stripe): `r_A = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`\n    *   Type B (horizontal stripe): `r_B = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n5.  **Linear Independence:** We check if these two row types are linearly independent. One vector is a scalar multiple of another if `r_A = k * r_B` or `r_B = k * r_A`.\n    *   `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]` is not a scalar multiple of `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.\n    *   Therefore, the two row types are linearly independent.\n6.  **Conclusion on Rank:** Since the matrix of the Danish flag is composed of two and only two linearly independent row types, its maximal rank is 2. The goal is to find African flags that also have a maximal rank of 2.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Criteria for a Flag to have a Rank of 2\n\nA flag will have a rank of 2 if its matrix representation, with distinct numerical values for each color, can be generated by a basis of exactly two linearly independent vectors.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** Designs consisting solely of horizontal stripes or solely of vertical stripes have a rank of 1.\n    *   For horizontal stripes (e.g., green, yellow, blue), the rows are `[G,G,G]`, `[Y,Y,Y]`, `[B,B,B]`. If G=1, Y=2, B=3, these rows are `[1,1,1]`, `[2,2,2]`, `[3,3,3]`, which are all scalar multiples of `[1,1,1]` and thus are linearly dependent. The rank is 1.\n    *   For vertical stripes (e.g., green, white, red), every row is identical: `[G,W,R]`. The rank is 1.\n*   **Rank > 1 Flags:** To achieve a rank greater than 1, a flag must have a design that introduces variations within rows and/or columns, such as crosses, emblems, cantons, or combinations of vertical and horizontal elements.\n*   **Rank 2 Flags:** We are looking for flags whose designs result in exactly two linearly independent row types. Common structures include:\n    1.  A base design of rank 1 (like vertical or horizontal stripes) with an added element (like an emblem or a perpendicular bar) that introduces exactly one new linearly independent row type.\n    2.  A combination of two simple elements, such as a horizontal bicolour and a vertical bar.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Flags of African Nations\n\nWe will now systematically evaluate the flags of African nations based on the criteria for having a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Flags with Horizontal Stripes + Central Emblem:** (e.g., Angola, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lesotho, Libya, Niger, Malawi, Rwanda, Mauritania)\n    *   These flags have a rank 1 base (horizontal stripes). The emblem adds a new row type. For example, in a red/black bicolour with a yellow emblem, the row types are `[Red, Red, Red]`, `[Red, Yellow, Red]`, `[Black, Yellow, Black]`, and `[Black, Black, Black]`. This set of vectors can be shown to be spanned by a basis of two vectors, giving a rank of 2.\n    *   **Qualifying Countries:** Angola, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lesotho, Libya, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda.\n\n*   **Flags with Vertical Stripes + Central Emblem:** (e.g., Cameroon, Senegal, Algeria)\n    *   These flags have a rank 1 base (vertical stripes). An emblem placed in one of the stripes creates a new, distinct row type. For example, in a G/R/Y tricolour with a star on the red stripe, the rows are `[G, R, Y]` and `[G, StarColor, Y]`. These two vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   **Qualifying Countries:** Algeria, Cameroon, Senegal.\n\n*   **Flags with a Vertical Bar + Horizontal Bicolour:** (e.g., Benin, Madagascar)\n    *   These flags have a vertical bar on the hoist side next to two horizontal stripes. For example, a Green bar with Yellow/Red stripes has row types `[G, Y, Y]` and `[G, R, R]`. These two vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   **Qualifying Countries:** Benin, Madagascar.\n\n*   **Flags Eliminated (Rank ≠ 2):**\n    *   **Rank 1:** Flags with only vertical or horizontal stripes (e.g., Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone). Note: Some sources may consider Botswana and The Gambia in this category, however, their fimbriated (bordered) stripes technically introduce more colors, which would raise the rank. By our careful analysis of horizontal stripes, however, their rank is 1.\n    *   **Rank > 2:** Flags with complex designs like diagonal stripes, multiple complex emblems, or detailed patterns that create three or more linearly independent row/column types (e.g., Burundi, Cabo Verde, Comoros, DRC, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe).\n\n### Step 4: Final List of Qualifying Flags\n\nBased on the analysis, the following African nations have flags with a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   Algeria\n*   Angola\n*   Benin\n*   Burkina Faso\n*   Cameroon\n*   Egypt\n*   Ethiopia\n*   Ghana\n*   Lesotho\n*   Libya\n*   Madagascar\n*   Malawi\n*   Mauritania\n*   Niger\n*   Rwanda\n*   Senegal\n\n<<<Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lesotho, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal>>>"
