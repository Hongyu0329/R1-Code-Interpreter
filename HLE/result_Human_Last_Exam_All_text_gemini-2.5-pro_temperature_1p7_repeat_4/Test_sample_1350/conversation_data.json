    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific character from William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*. The key identifying features of this character are:\n1.  They visited a Roman city.\n2.  They describe the religious practices they observed there.\n3.  This description contains details that a reader would recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Mythological Reference**\nThe myth of Romulus and Remus is central to the founding of Rome. The most iconic and recognizable part of this myth is the image of the infant twins being abandoned and then suckled and cared for by a she-wolf (Lupa). Therefore, the character's description must include a reference to a she-wolf and two human infants being worshipped or depicted as gods.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Context of the Novel**\n*The House of the Wolfings* depicts a Gothic tribe in conflict with the Roman Empire. The Romans are the antagonists. This context makes it unlikely that a character would have visited a Roman city for pleasure. It is more probable that such a visit occurred under duress, for example, as a captive or a slave.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Relevant Section in the Book**\nIn the early part of the book, Morris establishes the nature of the Goths' enemy, the Romans. This exposition happens in Chapter IV, titled \"An Old Goth tells of the Romans.\" This chapter is dedicated to a character sharing his first-hand knowledge of the Romans with the younger members of the tribe who have not yet faced them.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Character and their Description**\nThe character who speaks in Chapter IV is an elder of the tribe named **Otter**. He explains that he was once captured by the Romans and lived among them for a time before escaping. During his captivity, he observed their culture and religious practices.\n\nOtter gives a specific account of a Roman idol he saw in one of their \"God-houses\" (temples). He describes it as:\n\"...an image of a she-wolf with her teats, and two man-children sucking them: and this is one of the chiefest of their Gods, and their City-warder.\"\n\n**Step 6: Confirm the Connection to Romulus and Remus**\nOtter's description of a she-wolf suckling two male infants who are considered \"chiefest of their Gods\" and a \"City-warder\" is an unmistakable reference to the Capitoline Wolf statue, which depicts the legend of Romulus and Remus. The story positions the she-wolf and the twins she nurtured as foundational to the very identity and protection of the city of Rome.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe character who visited a Roman city (as a captive) and describes their religious practices in a way that directly refers to the myth of Romulus and Remus is the old Goth, Otter.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
