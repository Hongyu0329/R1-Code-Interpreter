The final state is not a single deterministic state but one of five possibilities depending on the outcome of the measurement on ququint A. The most probable outcome is measuring ququint A in state $|2\rangle$, which occurs with a probability of 3/10. The state of the system after this most likely measurement is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
