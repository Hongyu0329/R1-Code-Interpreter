    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT of a new sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**2. Formulate the DFT of the Interleaved Sequence**\n\nThe new sequence `y(n)` can be described as:\n*   `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3` (the even-indexed terms)\n*   `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3` (the odd-indexed terms)\n\nThe 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, denoted `Y(k)`, is given by the formula:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)` , where `W_N = e^(-j*2π/N)`.\n\nWe can split this summation into even and odd indices of `n`:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_8^((2m)k) + Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nSubstitute `x(m)` and `h(m)` into the equation:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\n**3. Simplify the Equation using DFT Properties**\n\nWe simplify the \"twiddle factors\" `W_8`:\n*   `W_8^(2mk) = (e^(-j*2π/8))^(2mk) = e^(-j*2πmk/4) = W_4^(mk)`\n*   `W_8^((2m+1)k) = W_8^(2mk) * W_8^k = W_4^(mk) * W_8^k`\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation for `Y(k)`:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * (Σ_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^(mk))`\n\nThe summations are the definitions of the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n*   `Σ_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) = X(k mod 4)`\n*   `Σ_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^(mk) = H(k mod 4)`\n\nThis gives us the final formula to compute `Y(k)`:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`.\n\n**4. Prepare for Calculation**\n\nThis formula is reminiscent of the decimation-in-time Radix-2 FFT algorithm. We can compute the first 4 points (`k=0,1,2,3`) and the last 4 points (`k=4,5,6,7`) using a butterfly structure.\n\n*   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n    `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n*   For `k = 4, 5, 6, 7`, let `k = k' + 4` where `k' = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n    `Y(k'+4) = X(k') + W_8^(k'+4) * H(k')`\n    Since `W_8^4 = e^(-j*π) = -1`, we get `W_8^(k'+4) = W_8^(k') * W_8^4 = -W_8^(k')`.\n    `Y(k'+4) = X(k') - W_8^(k') * H(k')`\n\nWe need the following values for the calculation:\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^(-jπ/4) = cos(π/4) - j*sin(π/4) = (1/√2) - j(1/√2)`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^(-j3π/4) = cos(3π/4) - j*sin(3π/4) = -(1/√2) - j(1/√2)`\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Interleaving:** Correctly identifying `y(n)` in terms of `x(n)` and `h(n)` is the crucial first step (`y(2m)=x(m)`, `y(2m+1)=h(m)`).\n*   **Twiddle Factor Simplification:** The step `W_8^(2mk) = W_4^(mk)` is key to relating the 8-point DFT to the 4-point DFTs.\n*   **DFT Periodicity:** Using `X(k mod 4)` and `H(k mod 4)` is important because the calculation for `k≥4` depends on the values of `X(k)` and `H(k)` for `k=0,1,2,3`.\n*   **Complex Arithmetic:** Calculations involving `j` and `√2` must be handled carefully, especially the multiplication of complex numbers.\n*   **Butterfly Structure:** Recognizing the `Y(k) = A + T` and `Y(k+4) = A - T` structure simplifies the calculation and reduces the chance of errors.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nWe now compute `Y(k)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`.\n\n**For k = 0:**\n*   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n*   `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n\n**For k = 1:**\n*   Let's first compute the term `T1 = W_8^1 * H(1)`:\n    `T1 = ((1/√2) - j(1/√2)) * (1+j) = (1/√2) * (1-j)(1+j) = (1/√2) * (1 - j^2) = (1/√2) * 2 = √2`\n*   `Y(1) = X(1) + T1 = j + √2`\n*   `Y(5) = X(1) - T1 = j - √2`\n\n**For k = 2:**\n*   Let's first compute the term `T2 = W_8^2 * H(2)`:\n    `T2 = (-j) * (1) = -j`\n*   `Y(2) = X(2) + T2 = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y(6) = X(2) - T2 = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n**For k = 3:**\n*   Let's first compute the term `T3 = W_8^3 * H(3)`:\n    `T3 = (-(1/√2) - j(1/√2)) * (1-j) = (-1/√2) * (1+j)(1-j) = (-1/√2) * (1 - j^2) = (-1/√2) * 2 = -√2`\n*   `Y(3) = X(3) + T3 = -j + (-√2) = -j - √2`\n*   `Y(7) = X(3) - T3 = -j - (-√2) = -j + √2`\n\n**Final Answer Assembly**\nCombining all the calculated values, we get the 8-point DFT `Y(k)`:\n`Y(k) = [Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), Y(6), Y(7)]`\n`Y(k) = [1, √2+j, -1-j, -√2-j, 1, -√2+j, -1+j, √2-j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
