    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key components.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific person based on several distinct clues:\n*   **Profession:** The person is a physicist.\n*   **Primary Field:** They are \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" This is a crucial qualifier.\n*   **Discovery:** They discovered an \"optical effect in real imagery.\"\n*   **Origin of Discovery:** The discovery was initiated \"after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker.\"\n*   **Apparatus Involved:** The observation was made while \"cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the anecdotal clue.**\nThe most unique part of the question is the story about a custodial worker's accidental observation. This specific anecdote points strongly towards one of two major discoveries in optics: the Schlieren effect (rediscovered by August Toepler) or the phase-contrast method (discovered by Frits Zernike).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the potential candidates against all clues.**\n\n*   **Candidate 1: August Toepler**\n    *   He was a physicist who developed the Schlieren method in 1864, which visualizes differences in refractive index.\n    *   The story of a worker noticing shimmers (or 'Schlieren') while cleaning optics is sometimes associated with him.\n    *   **However, Toepler is primarily known for his work in acoustics and high-speed photography, not microscopy.** This contradicts the key qualifier in the question that the physicist must be \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n\n*   **Candidate 2: Frits Zernike**\n    *   **Physicist:** Yes, Frits Zernike (1888-1966) was a Dutch physicist.\n    *   **Better known for work in microscopy:** Absolutely. Zernike won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 specifically for his invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**. This invention was revolutionary, allowing scientists to view unstained, transparent living cells for the first time. His name is almost synonymous with this advance in microscopy.\n    *   **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery:** Yes. He discovered the principle of phase contrast. The initial observation occurred while he was inspecting diffraction gratings with a spectrometer that used a **concave mirror**. He noticed faint \"ghost\" images next to the main spectral lines (which are real images).\n    *   **Accidentally observed by a custodial worker:** The historical account states that these faint ghost images, caused by periodic flaws in the grating, were first noticed by a laboratory assistant or custodian who pointed them out to Zernike, sparking his investigation into their nature. This matches the anecdote perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nFrits Zernike is the only physicist who fits all the criteria laid out in the question. He is a Nobel laureate celebrated for his work in microscopy, and the story of his discovery of phase contrast aligns perfectly with the anecdote about a worker, a concave mirror, and the observation of a subtle optical effect.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
