    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation.\n\nThe equation provided is `VIII / CCCLXXX - MCCLXI = ?`.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Roman numerals to modern (Arabic) numbers.**\n\n*   **VIII**: This is V (5) + I (1) + I (1) + I (1) = **8**.\n*   **CCCLXXX**: This is C (100) + C (100) + C (100) + L (50) + X (10) + X (10) + X (10) = 300 + 50 + 30 = **380**.\n*   **MCCLXI**: This is M (1000) + C (100) + C (100) + L (50) + X (10) + I (1) = 1000 + 200 + 50 + 10 + 1 = **1261**.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly interpret each Roman numeral. For example, `VIII` is 5+3, `CCCLXXX` is 300+80, and `MCCLXI` is 1000+200+60+1.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the equation with modern numbers.**\n\nSubstituting the converted numbers into the original equation, we get:\n`8 / 380 - 1261 = ?`\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).**\n\nAccording to the order of operations, division must be performed before subtraction.\n\n*   **First, perform the division:**\n    `8 / 380`\n    This can be simplified to `2 / 95`.\n    `8 ÷ 380 ≈ 0.02105`\n\n*   **Next, perform the subtraction:**\n    `(8 / 380) - 1261`\n    `0.02105 - 1261 = -1260.97895`\n\n**Careful Point:** The order of operations is critical. You must perform `8 / 380` first, and then subtract `1261` from the result. Performing `380 - 1261` first would be incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe calculation is `(8 / 380) - 1261`, which results in approximately **-1260.9789**.\n\n<<<-1260.9789>>>"
