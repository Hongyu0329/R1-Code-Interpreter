The first area Charles needs to adjust is his diet, which is currently too restrictive. He is limiting fats, carbohydrates, and animal protein all at once. This approach can lead to severe energy loss, fatigue, and intense hunger, making the plan unsustainable. He should modify his diet to include a balanced amount of healthy complex carbohydrates for energy, and healthy fats and lean protein for satiety, which will better support his lifestyle and future exercise goals.
