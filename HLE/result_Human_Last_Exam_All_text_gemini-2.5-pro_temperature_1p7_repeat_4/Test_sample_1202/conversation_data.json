    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify the most likely mechanism that explains two key outcomes for genes that have been duplicated in a genome:\n1.  **Retention:** The duplicated gene copy is not lost from the genome over evolutionary time (i.e., it avoids becoming a pseudogene or being deleted).\n2.  **Divergence:** The two gene copies (the original and the duplicate) evolve to become different from each other, either in their DNA sequence, their expression patterns (when and where they are turned on), or their specific biochemical functions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene sequence replaces another homologous sequence. In the case of duplicate genes, it tends to make the two copies more similar to each other, not more different. It works against divergence and leads to homogenization. Therefore, it does not explain divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene. One copy accumulates disabling mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene). While this certainly involves divergence (the pseudogene's sequence degrades), it does not involve the *retention* of a functional duplicate gene. It is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy of the gene retains the original function, while the second copy is free from selective pressure and accumulates random mutations. By chance, one of these mutations might create a new, beneficial function. Natural selection will then act to preserve this second copy.\n    *   **Retention:** Yes, the new beneficial function provides a reason to keep the gene.\n    *   **Divergence:** Yes, one gene has the old function, and the other has a new function.\n    *   **Likelihood:** This mechanism is valid but relies on the relatively rare occurrence of a gain-of-function mutation appearing before the gene is silenced by more common loss-of-function mutations.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., it was active in multiple tissues or had several biochemical roles). After duplication, each copy can sustain a mutation that disables one of its original subfunctions. If the two copies lose *different* subfunctions, then both genes are now required to fulfill the complete set of functions of the original ancestral gene.\n    *   **Retention:** Yes, because losing either copy would now be detrimental, there is selective pressure to keep both.\n    *   **Divergence:** Yes, the two genes have diverged in their functional roles, each specializing in a subset of the original functions. This is often accompanied by divergence in their regulatory sequences.\n    *   **Likelihood:** This mechanism is considered very likely because it only relies on common loss-of-function mutations, which happen much more frequently than gain-of-function mutations. This provides a robust and relatively common pathway to preserve duplicate genes.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into multiple new species. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not itself a molecular mechanism for the retention and divergence of individual genes within a genome. It describes a pattern at the species level, not the gene level.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models that explain both the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism. Subfunctionalization provides a pathway for preserving duplicate genes that relies on common, degenerative mutations, making it a more probable event than neofunctionalization, which requires a rare, beneficial gain-of-function mutation. Therefore, subfunctionalization is often considered a more frequent and thus \"more likely\" mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicated genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
