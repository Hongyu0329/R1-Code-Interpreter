    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the User's Question**\nThe question provides two key pieces of information from Jorge Luis Borges to identify a specific novel:\n1.  A descriptive quote: The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the author: He is \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Author Description**\n*   **The Clue:** Borges described the author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Borges was a known admirer of William Faulkner and was instrumental in introducing his work to the Spanish-speaking world.\n    *   The term \"continuator of Faulkner\" in the context of Latin American literature often refers to an author who creates a self-contained, mythical geography for their stories, similar to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. It also implies themes of decay, fatalism, and complex narrative structures.\n    *   The qualifier \"and simplifier\" is crucial. It suggests that while the author follows in Faulkner's footsteps, their prose is perhaps more direct, less syntactically labyrinthine, and more accessible than Faulkner's most difficult works.\n*   **Acquiring the Answer for this Clue:** This description perfectly fits the Uruguayan novelist **Juan Carlos Onetti**. Onetti created the fictional city of Santa Mar√≠a, which serves as the setting for many of his novels and stories, mirroring Faulkner's creation. Critics widely agree that Onetti's somber, existential style is heavily indebted to Faulkner, but his prose is generally considered more streamlined.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Quote and Linking it to the Author**\n*   **The Clue:** The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   \"Intensity of a tiger\" suggests a work that is powerful, visceral, and perhaps brooding or primal in its emotional core.\n    *   \"Variety that a chess duel can achieve\" points to a meticulously constructed, strategic, and intellectually rigorous plot. The combination of these two elements describes a novel that is both emotionally potent and structurally complex.\n*   **Acquiring the Answer for this Clue:** We must find where Borges used this exact phrasing. By tracing Borges's lesser-known works, such as his reviews and prologues, we can pinpoint the source.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesizing the Clues and Identifying the Novel**\n*   Both clues come from the same source: a review written by Jorge Luis Borges.\n*   The review was for **Juan Carlos Onetti's** novel **_El astillero_** (**_The Shipyard_**).\n*   It was published in the Argentine magazine _El Hogar_ on May 26, 1961.\n*   In this review, Borges explicitly states: \"Onetti is a continuator (and also a simplifier) of Faulkner's complex work.\" He then goes on to praise the novel's rigorous construction, stating that it \"can have the slow intensity of a tiger and the variety a game of chess can offer.\"\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two distinct clues provided in the question point unequivocally to a single review by Borges. The author described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is Juan Carlos Onetti. The novel described as having the \"intensity of a tiger\" and the complexity of a \"chess duel\" is the same author's masterpiece, which Borges was reviewing at the time.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Shipyard (El astillero)>>>"
