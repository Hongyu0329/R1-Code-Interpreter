    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the components of the Feynman diagram.**\n\n*   **Vertices:** The diagram has two vertices. In a perturbative expansion, vertices come from interaction terms in the Lagrangian. For instance, in a $\\phi^4$ theory, the interaction term is $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$, and each vertex has four field lines attached to it. The presence of two vertices means this diagram arises from the second-order term in the perturbation series, which includes a factor of $\\frac{1}{2!}$ from the Taylor expansion of the exponential.\n*   **Field Contractions (Propagators):** There are four field contractions between the two vertices. This means four lines (propagators) connect vertex 1 to vertex 2. This completely specifies the topology of the diagram: it is two points connected by four distinct lines.\n\n**2. Visualize the Diagram.**\n\nImagine two points, labeled Vertex A and Vertex B. There are four separate lines running from A to B.\n\n```\n      /-----\\\n     /-------\\\n( A )---------( B )\n     \\-------/\n      \\-----/\n```\n\nThis is sometimes called a \"sunrise\" or \"setting-sun\" diagram if it appears as a self-energy correction, but here we consider it as a standalone graph component.\n\n**3. Identify the Symmetries of the Diagram.**\n\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by 'S', is the number of ways the components of the diagram can be rearranged without changing the overall structure (topology) of the diagram. We need to identify all such symmetry operations.\n\n*   **Symmetry 1: Interchanging the Vertices.**\n    *   The two vertices are of the same type (e.g., both are $\\phi^4$ vertices).\n    *   We can swap the positions of Vertex A and Vertex B, and the diagram remains identical. Since there are two vertices, there are $2! = 2$ ways to arrange them.\n    *   This contributes a factor of **2** to the symmetry factor.\n\n*   **Symmetry 2: Interchanging the Propagators.**\n    *   There are four identical lines connecting Vertex A to Vertex B. These lines represent propagators of the same field type.\n    *   We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way, and the diagram's topology does not change. For example, swapping line 1 with line 2 results in the same diagram.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these four identical lines is $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n    *   This contributes a factor of **24** to the symmetry factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor.**\n\nThe total symmetry factor 'S' is the product of the factors from all independent symmetry operations.\n\n*   S = (Factor from vertex permutations) Ã— (Factor from propagator permutations)\n*   S = $2! \\times 4!$\n*   S = $2 \\times 24$\n*   S = 48\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Origin of Factors:** The factor of $2!$ comes from the permutation of identical vertices. The factor of $4!$ comes from the permutation of identical lines connecting the *same two points*.\n2.  **Theory Context:** This calculation is general and doesn't depend on the specifics of the field theory (e.g., whether it is $\\phi^4$ or some other interaction), as long as the vertices and lines being permuted are identical. The description \"two vertices and four field contractions\" is sufficient.\n3.  **Role in Calculation:** In a full calculation of the diagram's contribution to a Green's function, the diagram's value is divided by its symmetry factor S. For a $\\phi^4$ theory, the numerical prefactor for this diagram would be $\\frac{1}{S} \\frac{\\lambda^2}{(4!)^2}$, but the question only asks for the symmetry factor S itself. The overall prefactor from the perturbative series expansion (like $\\frac{1}{2!}$) is implicitly absorbed into the definition and calculation of S.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   Identify the number of ways to permute the two identical vertices: $2! = 2$.\n*   Identify the number of ways to permute the four identical propagators connecting these two vertices: $4! = 24$.\n*   Multiply these factors to get the total symmetry factor S.\n*   $S = 2! \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
