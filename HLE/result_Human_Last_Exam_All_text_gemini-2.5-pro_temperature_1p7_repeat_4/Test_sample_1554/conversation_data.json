    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** We are looking for a specific individual.\n    *   **What is their affiliation:** The person must be a philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School. This is a specific group of Polish logicians and analytic philosophers active primarily between the two World Wars.\n    *   **What did they do:** They \"decomposed the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals.\" This means they took a general concept, which can be translated as a \"hallmark,\" \"mark,\" or \"sign,\" and broke it down into at least two sub-categories: symptoms and signals.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This school, founded by Kazimierz Twardowski, emphasized clarity, logical rigor, and semantic analysis. Key members include Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The question is about the philosophy of language and semiotics, which was a central interest for several of these thinkers.\n    *   **Hallmark:** This term, in a philosophical context, refers to a sign or an indicator of something else. The original Polish term for this general category is often *oznaka*.\n    *   **Symptom:** In this context, a symptom is a type of sign that has a natural, causal connection to what it signifies.\n    *   **Signal:** A signal is a type of sign whose meaning is established by a convention, rule, or agreement. It does not have a natural causal link to what it signifies.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n    *   While many members of the Lviv-Warsaw School worked on the philosophy of language, the specific distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is most famously associated with **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz was a prominent logician and philosopher of language within the school. In his work, particularly in books like *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), he conducted a detailed semiotic analysis of language and signs.\n\n4.  **Analyze Ajdukiewicz's Distinction:**\n    *   Ajdukiewicz analyzed the broad category of signs (*oznaka*).\n    *   He distinguished **symptoms** (also sometimes called indexes) as signs that are causally linked to the thing they represent. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness, and smoke is a symptom of fire. The relationship exists in nature, independent of human agreement.\n    *   He contrasted these with **signals**, or conventional signs (*znak*), whose meaning is based on an intentional act of establishment or a convention. Words in a language are the primary example. The word \"tree\" signifies a tree not because of a natural link, but because speakers of English have agreed to use it that way. Other examples include traffic lights, a green light is a signal to \"go\" by convention, not by nature.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the general notion of a sign (or hallmark) into symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs).\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Translation:** The term \"hallmark\" is an English translation. The original Polish term is likely *oznaka*, which means \"mark\" or \"sign.\" Understanding this helps situate the discussion within semiotics (the theory of signs).\n2.  **Specificity:** While other philosophers, both inside and outside the Lviv-Warsaw school (like Charles Sanders Peirce with his icon/index/symbol distinction), have classified signs, the specific terminology of \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" for this particular natural/conventional distinction is a key feature of Ajdukiewicz's work.\n3.  **Context:** The Lviv-Warsaw School's emphasis on clarity and logical analysis of language makes it the perfect environment for such a distinction to be developed and rigorously defined. Ajdukiewicz's work is a prime example of this methodology applied to semiotics.\n\n***\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe question asks to identify a philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made a specific semiotic distinction. By analyzing the key figures of the school and their contributions, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz stands out for his work in logic and the philosophy of language. His analysis of signs, particularly his clear differentiation between naturally occurring signs (symptoms) and man-made, rule-based signs (signals), directly matches the description in the question.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
