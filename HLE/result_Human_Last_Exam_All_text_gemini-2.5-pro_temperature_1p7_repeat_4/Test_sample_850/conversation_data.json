    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Criteria**\n    The question asks to identify crystal classes (point groups) that satisfy three distinct conditions simultaneously:\n    a.  They must be **achiral**.\n    b.  They must be **non-polar**.\n    c.  They must have the **correct symmetry for optical activity**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Criterion Individually**\n\n    *   **Criterion (a): Achiral**\n        *   An object or structure is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n        *   In terms of crystal symmetry, a crystal class is achiral if its point group contains at least one improper rotation axis. The improper rotation operations are a mirror plane (m, which is equivalent to a 1-fold rotoinversion axis, S₁) or a center of inversion (i, which is equivalent to a 2-fold rotoinversion axis, S₂).\n        *   There are 21 achiral crystal classes out of the 32 total classes.\n\n    *   **Criterion (b): Non-polar**\n        *   A crystal is non-polar if it does not possess a unique polar axis. A polar axis is a direction in the crystal where the two ends are not equivalent by any symmetry operation of the point group.\n        *   All 11 centrosymmetric point groups (those with a center of inversion 'i') are non-polar.\n        *   Point groups that are acentric but have symmetry elements that prevent a unique polar direction (e.g., perpendicular 2-fold axes, or multiple rotation axes of order > 2) are also non-polar.\n        *   There are 22 non-polar crystal classes in total.\n\n    *   **Criterion (c): Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity**\n        *   Optical activity is the phenomenon where a material rotates the plane of linearly polarized light as it passes through.\n        *   The necessary and sufficient symmetry condition for a crystal class to exhibit optical activity is that it must be **chiral**.\n        *   A chiral crystal class is one that is *not* superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group must *not* contain any mirror planes (m) or a center of inversion (i).\n        *   There are 11 chiral crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432. These are also known as the enantiomorphic classes.\n\n3.  **Identify the Inherent Contradiction**\n\n    *   The question requires the crystal class to be **achiral** (Criterion a).\n    *   The question also requires the crystal class to have the correct symmetry for **optical activity**, which means it must be **chiral** (Criterion c).\n    *   By definition, \"achiral\" and \"chiral\" are mutually exclusive properties. A crystal class is either chiral or it is achiral; it cannot be both.\n        *   **Achiral**: Contains 'm' or 'i'.\n        *   **Chiral**: Lacks 'm' and 'i'.\n    *   Because of this direct contradiction, it is logically impossible for any crystal class to satisfy both Criterion (a) and Criterion (c).\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n\n    *   We are looking for the members of the following intersection of sets:\n        {Achiral Classes} ∩ {Non-polar Classes} ∩ {Optically Active (Chiral) Classes}\n    *   Since the set {Achiral Classes} and the set {Chiral Classes} have no members in common (their intersection is the empty set), the entire intersection of all three sets must also be the empty set.\n    *   Therefore, there are no crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity. The question is based on a contradictory premise.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are no crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions. The condition of being \"achiral\" and having the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" (which requires chirality) are mutually exclusive.\n\n<<<There are no such crystal classes.>>>"
