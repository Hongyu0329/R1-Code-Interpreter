The two main conditions are: 1. The domains X, Y, and Z must be non-empty complete metric spaces. 2. There must exist a constant k in [0, 1) such that for all (x₁, y₁, z₁) and (x₂, y₂, z₂) in X × Y × Z, the inequality `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))` holds.
