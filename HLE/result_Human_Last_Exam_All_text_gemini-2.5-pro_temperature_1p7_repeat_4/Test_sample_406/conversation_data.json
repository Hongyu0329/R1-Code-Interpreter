    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a set of points (x, y, z) from spaces X, Y, and Z, respectively, that remain unchanged after the application of three functions F, G, and H in a specific, coupled manner. The conditions for the existence of such a point can be derived by applying a standard fixed-point theorem, most commonly the Banach Contraction Principle, to an operator defined on the product of the spaces.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem and Key Concepts**\n\nFirst, we need to clarify the components of the problem.\n\n1.  **Spaces**: We are given three sets X, Y, and Z. For fixed-point theory, we assume they are non-empty **complete metric spaces** with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`, respectively. Completeness is a crucial requirement for guaranteeing the existence of a fixed point.\n2.  **Functions**: We are given three functions with specific domains and codomains.\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    *(Careful Point: The question listed \"G\" twice. It is standard to assume this is a typo and the third function is distinct, here denoted as H, to align with the \"FGH-tripled\" terminology.)*\n3.  **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**: An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` that satisfies the following system of equations:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 2: Reformulate as a Single Fixed Point Problem**\n\nThe problem of finding a tripled fixed point can be simplified by converting it into a standard fixed point problem for a single operator on a product space.\n\n1.  **Product Space**: Define a new space `M` as the Cartesian product `M = X × Y × Z`.\n2.  **Product Metric**: Equip `M` with a metric `d_M`. A common choice is the sum metric:\n    `d_M((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *(Careful Point: If X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces, the product space (M, d_M) is also a complete metric space.)*\n3.  **Combined Operator**: Define a single operator `T: M → M` using the functions F, G, and H:\n    `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n\nNow, finding a fixed point of `T`, which is a point `p = (x, y, z)` such that `T(p) = p`, is equivalent to finding the FGH-tripled fixed point, as `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)` expands to the three equations defining the tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Contraction Principle**\n\nThe Banach Contraction Principle provides a powerful tool for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point.\n\n*   **Theorem**: If `(M, d_M)` is a non-empty complete metric space and `T: M → M` is a **contraction mapping**, then `T` has a unique fixed point in `M`.\n*   **Contraction Mapping**: A mapping `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `p₁` and `p₂` in `M`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d_M(p₁, p₂)`\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Specific Conditions for F, G, and H**\n\nWe now apply the contraction condition to our operator `T`. Let `p₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` be two arbitrary points in `M`.\n\n1.  Calculate `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂))`:\n    `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) = d_M( (F(x₁,y₁,z₁), G(y₁,x₁,y₁), H(z₁,y₁,x₁)), (F(x₂,y₂,z₂), G(y₂,x₂,y₂), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) )`\n\n    Using the sum metric, this becomes:\n    `= d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n\n2.  Apply the contraction inequality:\n    `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d_M(p₁, p₂)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions for the metrics, we get the final condition:\n    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n    `≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe conditions for the functions `F: X×Y×Z → X`, `G: Y×X×Y → Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X → Z` to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n1.  **(Space Requirement)**: `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be non-empty complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **(Contraction Requirement)**: There must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality is satisfied:\n\n    `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\nIf these conditions are met, there exists a unique tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.\n\n<<<The two main conditions are: 1. The domains X, Y, and Z must be non-empty complete metric spaces. 2. There must exist a constant k in [0, 1) such that for all (x₁, y₁, z₁) and (x₂, y₂, z₂) in X × Y × Z, the inequality `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))` holds.>>>"
