    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Context:** The question focuses on **Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟)** and his \"first major defeat\" in Vietnam. This historical context is the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418-1427), a Vietnamese rebellion led by Lê Lợi against the Ming Dynasty's occupation (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination). Mu Sheng was a senior Ming commander, serving as the Grand Commandant overseeing the occupation for a significant period.\n\n2.  **Define \"First Major Defeat\":** A \"major defeat\" is not just a minor skirmish but a significant military or strategic setback that marks a turning point or results in the loss of substantial manpower, territory, or strategic initiative. \"First\" indicates we need to look at the timeline of the Lam Sơn Uprising for the earliest such event involving Mu Sheng.\n\n3.  **Examine the Early Phases of the Lam Sơn Uprising:** From 1418 to 1424, the Lam Sơn rebels fought primarily in the mountainous regions of their home base in Thanh Hóa. While they had some successes, the Ming army largely contained them, and no single event during this period would qualify as a \"major defeat\" for the supreme commander, Mu Sheng.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Turning Point (1424-1425):** The strategic situation changed dramatically in late 1424 when Lê Lợi, on the advice of his strategist Nguyễn Chích, moved his forces out of the mountains and south into the large, populous, and less-defended province of **Nghệ An**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Decisive Battle and its Connection to Mu Sheng:**\n    *   The Lam Sơn army quickly gained the upper hand in Nghệ An. In 1425, the pivotal engagement was the **Battle of Khả Lưu**.\n    *   In this battle, a Ming army commanded by Chen Zhi (Trần Trí) was sent to crush the rebellion in Nghệ An. However, Lê Lợi's forces ambushed and routed them decisively at Khả Lưu.\n    *   Although Chen Zhi was the field commander, this loss occurred under the supreme command of Mu Sheng. The defeat was so severe that it led to the near-total collapse of Ming control over the entire province of Nghệ An.\n    *   Mu Sheng himself led a relief expedition from the capital Đông Quan (modern Hanoi) to try and salvage the situation. However, upon facing the strength and strategic position of the Lam Sơn army, he was unable to reverse the loss and was forced to retreat, effectively ceding the vast and crucial territory of Nghệ An to the rebels.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on \"First Major Defeat\":** The loss of the entire province of Nghệ An in 1425, sealed by the tactical defeat at Khả Lưu and Mu Sheng's own failed relief attempt, constitutes his first major strategic defeat. It was the first time the Ming occupation lost control of a whole province, shifting the war's momentum firmly in favor of Lê Lợi. Later defeats, such as the one Mu Sheng suffered personally during his retreat at Lãnh Câu in 1427, occurred after this initial, decisive setback.\n\n7.  **Identify the Modern Location:** The battle of Khả Lưu took place within the historical territory of Nghệ An. Today, this location remains within the same modern province.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between a tactical defeat of a subordinate commander and a larger strategic defeat for which the supreme commander is responsible. In this case, Mu Sheng \"experienced\" the defeat both as the responsible leader who lost a province and as the commander of the failed relief force.\n*   It's important to differentiate this *first* major defeat in 1425 from the later, more famous Ming defeats of 1426 (Battle of Tốt Động-Chúc Động) and 1427 (Battle of Chi Lăng-Xương Giang), which did not involve Mu Sheng as the primary defeated commander.\n*   The question asks for the *current* Vietnamese province, which corresponds directly to the historical province of Nghệ An.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the first major defeat for Mu Sheng's command occurred when his forces lost control of the entire province of Nghệ An, a loss crystallized by the Battle of Khả Lưu in 1425.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
