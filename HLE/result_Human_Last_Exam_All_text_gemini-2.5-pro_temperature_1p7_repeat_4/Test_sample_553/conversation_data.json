    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question\n\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major.\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a major key, this chord is typically major and is called the dominant (V). For example, in C major, the fifth note is G, and the dominant chord is G major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is the crucial part of the question. It specifies that the chord on the fifth degree must be *minor*, not the standard major (dominant) chord. Using our C major example again, a minor fifth chord would be G minor. This is an unusual but very effective choice, often borrowed from the parallel minor key.\n*   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct, prominent transition from the first chord (tonic) to the second (minor fifth).\n*   **Starts with:** This progression must happen at the very beginning of the song.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Target Chord Progression\n\nThe question is looking for a song that starts with the progression **I -> v**. Let's map this to a few possible keys:\n\n*   In the key of **F Major**: The progression would be **F Major (I) -> C minor (v)**.\n*   In the key of **A Major**: The progression would be **A Major (I) -> E minor (v)**.\n*   In the key of **G Major**: The progression would be **G Major (I) -> D minor (v)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs\n\nWe will now go through well-known Beatles intros to see if they match this specific I -> v progression.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: Famous for its opening chord, but it's a complex, dissonant chord (often analyzed as a G11sus4 or similar) and not a simple I -> v progression.\n*   **\"Help!\"**: The main verse starts on C#m, which is the relative minor, not the tonic. The progression is not I -> v.\n*   **\"I Feel Fine\"**: The intro is a guitar riff over a D major -> G major -> C major chord sequence. This is not I -> v.\n*   **\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"**: The famous intro is a descending piano line in A minor. The progression is Am -> G -> F# -> F. This is a progression in a minor key, starting i -> bVII... not I -> v.\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: Let's analyze this one closely.\n    *   The song is in the key of **F Major**. Therefore, the **tonic (I)** chord is **F Major**.\n    *   The fifth degree of F is C. A standard dominant chord would be C Major. A **minor fifth (v)** chord would be **C minor**.\n    *   The song begins with a gentle arpeggiated guitar figure that establishes the key of F Major.\n    *   When the vocals enter with \"Michelle, ma belle...\", the chord under \"Michelle\" is F Major (the tonic). On the word \"belle,\" the chord changes decisively to **C minor** (the minor fifth).\n    *   This is a perfect match: the song starts with a jump from the tonic (F Major) to the minor fifth (C minor).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis confirms that the song \"Michelle\" is the correct answer. Its signature opening vocal line is built directly on the chord change from the tonic (F Major) to the minor fifth (C minor), exactly as described in the question.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
