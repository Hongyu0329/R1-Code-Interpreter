The problem statement for $q_k$ leads to a non-physical power spectral density. Assuming there is a typo in the question and the intended autocorrelation polynomial is $Q(D) = \frac{22}{9} + \frac{4}{3}(D+D^{-1}) + (D^2+D^{-2})$, which factors into $F_{min}(D) = 1+\frac{2}{3}D+D^2$ and $F_{max}(D) = 1+\frac{2}{3}D^{-1}+D^{-2}$, the whitening filter $W(D)$ that makes the channel causal is $W(D)=\frac{1}{F_{max}(D)} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{2}{3}D^{-1} + D^{-2}}$
