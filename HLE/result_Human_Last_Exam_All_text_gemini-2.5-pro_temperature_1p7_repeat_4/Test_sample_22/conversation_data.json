    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Statement:**\n    The core of the question lies in the relationship between two key concepts in genetics:\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of variation in a specific trait (phenotype) that can be explained by the combined additive effects of *all* common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It is the theoretical upper limit or the \"ceiling\" of how much of a trait's variance can be predicted using a linear model of common SNPs. It's typically estimated using methods like LD Score Regression or GCTA on large datasets.\n    *   **Predictive Ability of a Polygenic Score (PGS):** A polygenic score is a practical tool. It's a single score calculated for an individual by summing their genotypes at many SNPs, weighted by the effect sizes of those SNPs. These effect sizes are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability is then measured (usually with R², the proportion of variance explained) by testing how well this score predicts the trait in a *new, independent* sample of individuals. This is the \"actual\" or \"realized\" predictive power.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Relationship between the Two Concepts:**\n    *   **The Ceiling vs. The Achievement:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the theoretical ceiling. It answers the question: \"If we knew the true causal effect of every single common SNP, how well could we predict the phenotype?\" The predictive ability of a PGS (R²) is the practical achievement. It answers the question: \"Using our *estimated* SNP effects from a finite study, how well can we *actually* predict the phenotype in a new sample?\"\n    *   **Sources of Imperfection in PGS:** A PGS will almost never reach the theoretical ceiling of SNP heritability. This is because the process of creating and testing a PGS introduces several sources of error and information loss that are not present in the theoretical definition of h²_SNP:\n        *   **Estimation Error:** The SNP effect sizes used to build the PGS are derived from a GWAS with a finite sample size. This means the effect sizes are only estimates, not the true values, and they have statistical noise (standard errors). This noise degrades the predictive performance.\n        *   **Winner's Curse:** SNPs that are selected for a PGS because they pass a certain statistical threshold in the GWAS are likely to have their effects overestimated. Using these inflated effect sizes leads to poorer prediction in a new sample.\n        *   **Incomplete Information:** Simpler PGS methods might only use a subset of SNPs (e.g., those passing a significance threshold), thereby missing the collective contribution of many SNPs with smaller, real effects. Even methods using all SNPs are still limited by the quality of the effect size estimates.\n        *   **Population Differences:** The genetic structure (e.g., linkage disequilibrium patterns) might differ between the GWAS sample where effects were estimated and the target sample where the PGS is being tested. This mismatch reduces accuracy.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on the Relationship:**\n    Because a polygenic score is constructed using imperfect, estimated data from a finite sample, its ability to explain variance (R²) in a new sample will be lower than the total variance that is theoretically explainable by all SNPs (h²_SNP). The R² of a PGS can only approach the h²_SNP as the sample size of the discovery GWAS approaches infinity and other confounding factors are perfectly controlled, which is not possible in practice. Therefore, the predictive power of a PGS is fundamentally limited by the SNP heritability. It cannot exceed it, and for all practical purposes, will be strictly lower than it.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition:** It is critical to be precise about the definitions. h²_SNP is the total variance explainable in principle, while PGS R² is the variance explained in practice by a specific score.\n*   **\"Necessarily\":** The word \"necessarily\" implies this is a fundamental constraint, not just a common observation. The relationship R²_PGS ≤ h²_SNP is a mathematical and theoretical certainty, as the PGS is an attempt to capture the signal that h²_SNP quantifies. The equality (R²_PGS = h²_SNP) is only possible in an unattainable theoretical limit (e.g., infinite sample sizes for the GWAS). Thus, in any real-world scenario, the relationship is necessarily R²_PGS < h²_SNP.\n*   **Artifacts:** In a flawed analysis (e.g., with uncorrected population stratification present in both the discovery and test sets), it's conceivable to get an inflated R² that might artifactually approach or exceed a poorly estimated h²_SNP. However, the statement assumes a methodologically sound context where these terms have their intended meaning.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement holds true as a fundamental principle in statistical genetics.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
