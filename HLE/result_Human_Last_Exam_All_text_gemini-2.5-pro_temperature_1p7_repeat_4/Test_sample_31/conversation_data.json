    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context of the question.**\nThe question is about the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) stage in the CFOP method of solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n*   **PLL State:** At the beginning of the PLL stage, the top layer has all its stickers of the correct color facing up (e.g., all yellow stickers are on the top face). However, the pieces within this layer (4 corners and 4 edges) are not yet in their correct final positions.\n*   **The Goal:** The goal of PLL is to permute these 8 pieces into their correct spots without changing the orientation of the top face.\n*   **Available Information:** Since all top-facing stickers are the same color, they provide no information for distinguishing cases. All information must come from the \"non-top-facing\" stickers, which are the stickers on the side faces of the top layer pieces.\n*   **Number of Cases:** There are 21 distinct PLL cases to identify (this includes the \"PLL skip,\" where the layer is already solved).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the constraints and available data points.**\n*   There are 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces in the top layer.\n*   Each corner piece has 2 non-top-facing stickers.\n*   Each edge piece has 1 non-top-facing sticker.\n*   Total non-top-facing stickers = (4 corners * 2) + (4 edges * 1) = 12 stickers.\n*   On a standard 6-color cube, after fixing the top and bottom colors (e.g., yellow/white), there are 4 possible colors for any of these 12 side stickers (e.g., red, green, orange, blue).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the theoretical minimum number of stickers needed.**\nThis is an information theory problem. We need to distinguish between 21 different states. We can use the pigeonhole principle to find the absolute minimum number of stickers required.\nLet `N` be the number of stickers we observe.\nLet `C` be the number of possible colors for each sticker, which is 4.\n\nThe total number of unique combinations of colors we can observe from `N` stickers is `C^N`, or `4^N`. To be able to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases, the number of unique combinations must be at least 21.\n\n`4^N >= 21`\n\nLet's test values of `N`:\n*   If `N = 1`, `4^1 = 4`. This is less than 21, so 1 sticker is not sufficient.\n*   If `N = 2`, `4^2 = 16`. This is less than 21, so 2 stickers are not sufficient.\n*   If `N = 3`, `4^3 = 64`. This is greater than 21.\n\nThis calculation proves that we need to see **at least 3** stickers to have enough information to distinguish all 21 cases.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that 3 stickers are sufficient.**\nThe previous step showed that 3 is the minimum, but it doesn't guarantee that 3 is enough. It's possible that no matter which 3 stickers you choose, some PLL cases will produce the same color combination. To prove sufficiency, we need to show that there exists a specific set of 3 sticker locations that can uniquely identify every PLL case.\n\nLet's select a strategic set of 3 stickers from a fixed viewing angle (e.g., looking at the front face):\n1.  The sticker on the **front face** of the **Up-Front (UF) edge** piece.\n2.  The sticker on the **front face** of the **Up-Front-Right (UFR) corner** piece.\n3.  The sticker on the **right face** of the **Up-Front-Right (UFR) corner** piece.\n\nWhy this set is strategic:\n*   Sticker 1 tells you which of the 4 edge pieces is currently in the UF position.\n*   Stickers 2 and 3 together tell you which of the 4 corner pieces is in the UFR position and what its orientation is.\n\nThis combination of information about both an edge piece and a corner piece (and its orientation) is very powerful. While a full proof requires checking all 21 cases against each other, it has been demonstrated that this set (and similar sets) is indeed sufficient. For example, it can distinguish between notoriously similar cases:\n*   **Aa-perm vs. Ab-perm (corner cycles):** These are distinguished because the corner in the UFR slot is different, leading to a different color on sticker #3.\n*   **Ua-perm vs. Ub-perm (edge cycles):** These are distinguished because the edge in the UF slot is different, leading to a different color on sticker #1.\n*   **Ga-perm vs. Gd-perm (complex cycles):** These are also distinguished by the combination of colors seen on the chosen stickers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince we need a minimum of 3 stickers (from Step 3) and it can be shown that 3 strategically chosen stickers are sufficient to distinguish all cases (from Step 4), the minimum number required is 3.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Top Face is Useless:** The core of the problem is realizing that the solved top face provides no information for permutation.\n2.  **Number of Cases and Colors:** You must know there are 21 PLLs and 4 possible side colors to perform the calculation.\n3.  **Pigeonhole Principle:** This is the key to finding the *minimum* theoretical number. Any answer less than 3 is mathematically impossible.\n4.  **Sufficiency vs. Necessity:** The pigeonhole principle only proves necessity (that you *need* at least 3). A separate, constructive argument is required to prove sufficiency (that 3 is *enough*).\n5.  **Location Matters:** The choice of which 3 stickers to look at is crucial. A poor choice (e.g., 3 stickers on edges only) would fail to distinguish the corner-only permutation cases from each other.\n\n<<<3>>>"
