    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Goal**\n\nWe are given the polynomial $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$. We need to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Connecting the Goal to a Mathematical Property**\n\nFor a polynomial $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$ with real coefficients, the sum of the squares of its coefficients, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, can be found by calculating the constant term of the product $P(x)P(1/x)$.\n\nLet's verify this.\n$P(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \\dots$\n$P(1/x) = a_0 + a_1x^{-1} + a_2x^{-2} + \\dots$\nThe product is $P(x)P(1/x) = (\\sum_j a_j x^j)(\\sum_l a_l x^{-l})$.\nA term in this product is of the form $a_j a_l x^{j-l}$. For this term to be a constant (i.e., the power of $x$ is 0), we must have $j=l$. The constant term is the sum of all such terms, which is $\\sum_j a_j a_j = \\sum_j a_j^2$.\nSo, our goal is to find the constant term of $P(x)P(1/x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Decomposing the Polynomial P(x)**\n\nLet's analyze the factors of $P(x)$. Each factor is of the form $F_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$.\nLet $y_i = x^{3^i}$. The factor is $1+y_i+y_i^2+y_i^3$.\nThis can be factored as $(1+y_i)(1+y_i^2)$.\nSo, $F_i(x) = (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i})$.\n\nThis allows us to rewrite $P(x)$ as:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left[ (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}) \\right]$\n$P(x) = \\left( \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i}) \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}) \\right)$\n\nLet's call these two parts $A(x)$ and $B(x)$.\n$A(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})$\n$B(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i})$\nSo, $P(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n\n**Step 4: Interpreting the Coefficients of A(x) and B(x)**\n\nLet's expand $A(x)$. When we multiply out the terms, we get a sum of terms of the form $x^m$, where the exponent $m$ is a sum of distinct powers of 3 (e.g., $x^{3^0}x^{3^2} = x^{1+9}=x^{10}$). An integer can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 3 if and only if its representation in base 3 contains only the digits 0 and 1. For each such integer $m$, the term $x^m$ appears exactly once in the expansion of $A(x)$. So, the coefficients of $A(x)$ are all either 0 or 1. Let $A(x) = \\sum_m \\alpha_m x^m$, where $\\alpha_m \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n\nSimilarly, let's expand $B(x)$. The exponents are sums of distinct terms of the form $2 \\cdot 3^i$. An exponent $n$ is of the form $\\sum_{i \\in S} 2 \\cdot 3^i = 2 \\sum_{i \\in S} 3^i$. Such an integer $n$, when written in base 3, contains only the digits 0 and 2. The coefficients of $B(x)$ are also all either 0 or 1. Let $B(x) = \\sum_n \\beta_n x^n$, where $\\beta_n \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Using the Decomposition to Find the Sum of Squares**\n\nWe need the constant term of $P(x)P(1/x) = [A(x)B(x)][A(1/x)B(1/x)]$.\nThis can be rearranged as $[A(x)A(1/x)] \\cdot [B(x)B(1/x)]$.\nLet's find the constant term of this product of four polynomials. A key insight is needed here about the structure of the exponents.\n\nLet $S_A$ be the set of exponents of $A(x)$ (numbers with base-3 digits 0 or 1).\nLet $S_B$ be the set of exponents of $B(x)$ (numbers with base-3 digits 0 or 2).\n\nThe sum of squares $\\sum_k a_k^2$ has a combinatorial interpretation. It's the number of quadruplets $(m_1, m_2, n_1, n_2)$ such that $m_1, m_2 \\in S_A$, $n_1, n_2 \\in S_B$, and $m_1 + n_1 = m_2 + n_2$.\nThis equation can be rewritten as $m_1 - m_2 = n_2 - n_1$.\n\nLet $K = m_1 - m_2$. Since $m_1, m_2 \\in S_A$, their base-3 digits are from $\\{0, 1\\}$.\nLet $m_1 = \\sum c_i 3^i$ and $m_2 = \\sum c'_i 3^i$, with $c_i, c'_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThen $K = \\sum (c_i - c'_i) 3^i$. The \"digits\" of $K$ in this representation, $k_i = c_i - c'_i$, must be in the set $\\{0-1, 0-0, 1-0, 1-1\\} = \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nLet $L = n_2 - n_1$. Since $n_1, n_2 \\in S_B$, their base-3 digits are from $\\{0, 2\\}$.\nLet $n_1 = \\sum e_i 3^i$ and $n_2 = \\sum e'_i 3^i$, with $e_i, e'_i \\in \\{0, 2\\}$.\nThen $L = \\sum (e'_i - e_i) 3^i$. The \"digits\" of $L$, $l_i = e'_i - e_i$, must be in the set $\\{0-2, 0-0, 2-0, 2-2\\} = \\{-2, 0, 2\\}$.\n\nWe need to find numbers that can be represented in both ways, i.e., $K=L$.\nSo we need $\\sum k_i 3^i = \\sum l_i 3^i$, which implies $\\sum (k_i - l_i) 3^i = 0$.\nLet $\\delta_i = k_i - l_i$. $\\delta_i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\} - \\{-2,0,2\\} = \\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\nFor the sum $\\sum \\delta_i 3^i = 0$ to hold, we can analyze it modulo 3.\n$\\delta_0 + 3\\delta_1 + 9\\delta_2 + \\dots = 0$. This implies $\\delta_0$ must be a multiple of 3. So $\\delta_0 \\in \\{-3, 0, 3\\}$.\nIf we divide the whole equation by 3, we get $\\delta_0/3 + \\delta_1 + 3\\delta_2 + \\dots = 0$. This implies $\\delta_1 \\equiv -\\delta_0/3 \\pmod 3$.\nRepeating this argument, we can show that $\\delta_i$ must be a multiple of 3 for all $i$.\nSo $\\delta_i \\in \\{-3, 0, 3\\}$.\nLet's consider the representation $K = \\sum k_i 3^i$ and $L=\\sum l_i 3^i$. A number has a unique balanced ternary representation with digits $\\{-1,0,1\\}$. Similarly, a number has a unique base-3 representation with digits $\\{0,1,2\\}$. The representations we have are related to these. The crucial point is that the sets of possible digits for $K$ ($\\{-1,0,1\\}$) and for $L$ ($\\{-2,0,2\\}$) are different. Their only common digit is 0.\n\nIf $\\sum k_i 3^i = \\sum l_i 3^i$, this implies $k_i=l_i$ for all $i$. To see this, assume there is a highest index $p$ where $k_p \\neq l_p$. Then $(k_p-l_p)3^p = \\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}(l_i-k_i)3^i$. The magnitude of the right side is $|\\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}(l_i-k_i)3^i| \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}|l_i-k_i|3^i \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}3 \\cdot 3^i = \\frac{3}{2}(3^p-1)$. The left side is $|k_p-l_p|3^p \\ge 1\\cdot 3^p$. So $3^p \\le \\frac{3}{2}(3^p-1) \\implies 2 \\cdot 3^p \\le 3 \\cdot 3^p - 3 \\implies 3 \\le 3^p$, which is true for $p \\ge 1$ but does not exclude solutions. However, the modular arithmetic argument is stronger: $\\delta_i$ must be a multiple of 3 for all $i$.\nSo $k_i-l_i \\in \\{-3,0,3\\}$. Since $k_i\\in\\{-1,0,1\\}$ and $l_i\\in\\{-2,0,2\\}$, the only way for $k_i=l_i$ is if $k_i=l_i=0$. If $k_i-l_i = \\pm 3$, for instance $k_i=1, l_i=-2$, this corresponds to a valid solution. For instance $3_d-3_l = (1,-2)$ works. So $k_1-l_1=-3 \\implies -3.3^p$ argument. $|k_p-l_p|3^p = 3 \\cdot 3^p$. $3^{p+1} \\le 3/2(3^p-1) \\implies 2 \\cdot 3^p \\le 3^p-1 \\implies 3^p \\le -1$, which is impossible.\nTherefore, the only way for $\\sum (k_i - l_i) 3^i = 0$ is if all $k_i-l_i=0$. Since the only common value in the sets of possible digits is 0, this implies $k_i=0$ and $l_i=0$ for all $i$.\n\nSo, $K=L=0$.\nThis means $m_1-m_2=0$ and $n_2-n_1=0$.\nHence, $m_1=m_2$ and $n_1=n_2$.\n\nThe problem reduces to counting the number of quadruplets $(m_1, m_1, n_1, n_1)$ where $m_1 \\in S_A$ and $n_1 \\in S_B$.\nThe number of choices for $m_1$ is the number of elements in $S_A$. $|S_A|$ is the number of integers whose base-3 representation (up to $3^{19}$) has only digits 0 or 1. This is equivalent to choosing a subset of the 20 powers of three $\\{3^0, 3^1, \\dots, 3^{19}\\}$, so there are $2^{20}$ such numbers.\n$|S_A| = 2^{20}$.\nThe number of choices for $n_1$ is the number of elements in $S_B$. $|S_B|$ is the number of integers whose base-3 representation has only digits 0 or 2. This is equivalent to choosing a subset of $\\{2\\cdot3^0, 2\\cdot3^1, \\dots, 2\\cdot3^{19}\\}$, so there are also $2^{20}$ such numbers.\n$|S_B| = 2^{20}$.\n\nThe total count is the number of choices for $m_1$ times the number of choices for $n_1$.\nTotal count = $|S_A| \\times |S_B| = 2^{20} \\times 2^{20} = 2^{40}$.\n\n**Step 6: Final calculation**\n\n$2^{40} = (2^{10})^4 = (1024)^4 \\approx (10^3)^4 = 10^{12}$.\nThe question asks for the value, not an approximation.\nThe value is $4^{20}$ or $2^{40}$.\n\nFinal check of the crucial argument: Uniqueness of representation. The argument `3^p <= -1 is impossible` proves that no non-zero value can be represented both ways. Hence the only value is 0. This seems correct.\n\nTherefore, $\\sum_k a_k^2 = |S_A| \\cdot |S_B| = 2^{20} \\cdot 2^{20} = 4^{20}$.\n\nFinal answer must be in the form of a number. $4^{20} = (2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$."
