    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The request asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film containing a precise set of events:\n    *   **An Oscar-nominated film:** The movie must have been nominated for at least one Academy Award.\n    *   **A character seals his fate:** This implies a pivotal, often negative, turning point for a character (or group) caused by their own action. The outcome is now certain.\n    *   **By saying \"Thank you\":** The specific trigger is this seemingly innocent phrase of gratitude.\n    *   **While boarding a bus:** The setting for this action is a bus, during the act of getting on it.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Elimination:**\n    *   Common films with bus scenes like *Forrest Gump*, *Speed*, or *Little Miss Sunshine* do not fit the \"sealing fate with 'thank you'\" element.\n    *   Crime and spy thrillers are a good genre to check, as small mistakes often have huge consequences. For example, in *Inglourious Basterds*, a character's non-German hand gesture for the number three gives him away, but this does not match the specific details of the question.\n\n3.  **Identify the Correct Film:** The film that precisely matches all these clues is **_Argo_**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Details in _Argo_:**\n    *   **Is it Oscar-nominated?** Yes, *Argo* (2012) was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won three, including the Oscar for Best Picture.\n    *   **What is the scene?** During the film's climax, the six American diplomats, disguised as a Canadian film crew, are trying to escape from the Tehran airport in Iran. After a tense interrogation at the gate, they are finally cleared to leave.\n    *   **Does it involve a bus?** Yes. They walk from the gate to a shuttle bus that will take them across the tarmac to their airplane.\n    *   **What is the \"Thank you\" moment?** As the diplomats are boarding the bus, one of them (Robert Anders, played by Tate Donovan), filled with relief, looks back at one of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards who had been questioning them. He instinctively mouths the Farsi word for \"Thank you\" (\"Mamnoon\").\n    *   **How does this \"seal their fate\"?** The diplomats are pretending to be Canadians who do not speak Farsi. The use of a native Farsi phrase confirms the guard's suspicion that they are not who they claim to be. The guard immediately makes a phone call, which triggers the airport authorities to race to the runway in an attempt to stop their plane from taking off. This single polite gesture jeopardizes the entire escape mission at the last possible second, sealing the necessity for a dangerous, last-ditch getaway.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The phrase \"Thank you\" is mouthed in Farsi (\"Mamnoon\"), not spoken aloud in English, but its meaning and consequence are the same.\n*   The \"bus\" is an airport tarmac shuttle bus, not a city bus, but it fits the description perfectly.\n*   \"Seals his fate\" refers to how the character's action confirms the enemy's suspicion and triggers the film's final chase sequence, nearly leading to the failure of the mission and the capture or death of everyone involved.\n\nBy following these steps and carefully considering the details, we can confidently identify the correct film.\n\n<<<Argo>>>"
