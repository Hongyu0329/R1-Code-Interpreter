    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat:**\n    Coiled-coils are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the oligomer. The spacing is such that residue `a` is followed by residue `d` three positions later (i.e., at `a+3`).\n    Let's examine the provided sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\n2.  **Locate the Hydrophobic Core Residues (`a` and `d`):**\n    We need to find a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues. The main hydrophobic residues in this sequence are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W).\n    A key feature of coiled-coils is a consistent pattern of hydrophobic residues. Let's look for residues that appear every 7 positions.\n    *   Leucine (L) appears at positions 7, 14, 21, and 28. This perfect 7-residue spacing is a very strong indicator that Leucine occupies a specific position in the heptad repeat, most likely the `d` position, which is common for Leucine Zippers and related structures.\n    *   If L is at position `d`, then position `a` must be 3 residues before it.\n        *   For L(7), `a` is at position 4, which is Alanine (A).\n        *   For L(14), `a` is at position 11, which is Alanine (A).\n        *   For L(21), `a` is at position 18, which is Alanine (A).\n        *   For L(28), `a` is at position 25, which is Alanine (A).\n    *   This assignment is perfectly consistent throughout the sequence. We have a clear pattern.\n\n3.  **Summarize the Core Residue Identity:**\n    *   **Position `a`:** Always Alanine (A).\n    *   **Position `d`:** Always Leucine (L).\n\n4.  **Apply Knobs-into-Holes and Packing Efficiency Principles:**\n    The identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state.\n    *   **Alanine (A):** has a small methyl group (-CH3) side chain.\n    *   **Leucine (L):** has a larger, non-beta-branched isobutyl side chain.\n\n    Let's consider the packing for different oligomeric states:\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a classic dimeric leucine zipper, you typically find Leucine at the `d` position and a beta-branched amino acid (like Isoleucine or Valine) at the `a` position. The small size of Alanine at the `a` position can lead to suboptimal packing (cavities) in a standard dimer, making it less stable.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** In a trimer, the `a` positions from all three helices pack against each other, as do the `d` positions. If Alanine were at the `a` positions, the three small methyl groups would pack very poorly, leaving a large empty channel down the axis of the trimer. This is highly unfavorable from a packing efficiency standpoint. Therefore, a trimer is very unlikely.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** A tetramer is often formed as a \"dimer of dimers.\" In this arrangement, two canonical dimers pack against each other. The interface within each dimer is primarily formed by the `d` residues (the \"leucine zipper\" motif). The interface between the two dimers is formed by the `a` residues. The small size of Alanine at the `a` position is ideal for this inter-dimer interface. It allows the two dimers to pack closely together to form a stable tetramer without the steric clashes that larger residues at the `a` position would cause. This `a=A`, `d=L` pattern is a classic and well-studied motif that strongly directs the formation of a tetrameric coiled-coil.\n    *   **Higher-Order Oligomers (5+):** These states are rarer and typically require different sequence patterns. The `A` at `a` and `L` at `d` combination is not characteristic of these structures.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sequence has Alanine consistently at the `a` position and Leucine consistently at the `d` position. Based on established principles of coiled-coil packing, this specific combination of a small residue at `a` and a larger residue at `d` strongly favors the formation of a tetramer (a dimer of dimers).\n\n<<<C>>>"
