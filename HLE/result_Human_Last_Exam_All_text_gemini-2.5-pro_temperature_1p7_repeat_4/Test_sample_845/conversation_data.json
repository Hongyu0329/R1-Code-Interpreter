    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Technology Used:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture beat-to-beat intervals. PPG works by detecting changes in blood volume in the microvascular bed of tissue, which correspond to heartbeats.\n    *   **Data Captured:** The core data being captured is the \"beat-to-beat interval.\" This is the time duration from one heartbeat to the very next one.\n    *   **Computed Metric:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is calculated from these intervals.\n    *   **The Core Question:** The user wants to know the specific name for the value representing the time *between* individual, consecutive heartbeats.\n\n2.  **Analyze Key Terms:**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR):** This is typically an average measure, expressed in beats per minute (bpm). It tells you how fast your heart is beating on average, but not the specific timing between each beat.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is a measure of the *variation* or fluctuation in the time between successive heartbeats. It is not the interval itself but a statistical calculation (like standard deviation) performed on a series of these intervals. For example, high HRV means the time between beats is constantly changing, which is generally a sign of a healthy, adaptable cardiovascular system.\n    *   **Beat-to-Beat Interval:** This is the time elapsed between two consecutive heartbeats. This is the raw data used to calculate both average Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability.\n\n3.  **Identify the Correct Terminology:**\n    *   When using an Electrocardiogram (ECG), the most prominent spike is the \"R-wave.\" The time between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**. This is considered the gold standard.\n    *   When using PPG, there is no R-wave. Instead, the sensor detects the peak of the blood pulse. The time between these peaks can be called a **Peak-to-Peak (PP) interval** or **Pulse-to-Pulse interval**.\n    *   A more general and widely used term that encompasses the time measurement between any two consecutive heartbeats, regardless of the measurement technology (ECG or PPG), is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    *   The question asks for the name of the value *between heartbeats* from which HRV is computed.\n    *   This value is the raw time measurement between each beat.\n    *   The most appropriate and common technical term for this value is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **HR vs. HRV vs. IBI:** It's crucial to distinguish between these three related but distinct terms. IBI is the raw time data (e.g., in milliseconds). HR is the rate derived from the average IBI. HRV is the measure of the variability of the IBI values over time.\n*   **Technology Specificity (ECG vs. PPG):** While \"R-R interval\" is specific to ECG, \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" is a more universal term that is accurate for data derived from PPG as well. Given the context of the question (PPG), IBI is the best and most precise answer.\n\nThe value measured between consecutive heartbeats, which serves as the fundamental data for computing HRV, is called the Inter-Beat Interval.\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)"
