    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables (e.g., matrices). The formula is an infinite series:\n$Z = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X,Y)$\nEach term $Z_n(X,Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of total degree $n$ in $X$ and $Y$. These polynomials are constructed using nested commutators (Lie brackets), e.g., $[X,Y] = XY-YX$.\nFor example:\n$Z_1 = X+Y$\n$Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y]$\n$Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y,[Y,X]]$\n\n### Step 2: Relate BCH Terms to Free Lie Algebras\nThe terms $Z_n(X,Y)$ are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by $X$ and $Y$, denoted as $L(X,Y)$. Specifically, $Z_n$ belongs to the subspace of homogeneous elements of degree $n$, denoted as $L_n(X,Y)$.\n\nTo count the number of coefficients, we can express $Z_n$ as a linear combination of basis elements of the vector space $L_n(X,Y)$.\n$Z_n(X,Y) = \\sum_{w \\in B_n} c_w w(X,Y)$\nwhere $B_n$ is a basis for $L_n(X,Y)$ (e.g., a Hall basis or a Lyndon basis) and $c_w$ are the coefficients. The question asks for the number of coefficients $c_w$ that are not zero for $n=10$.\n\n### Step 3: Use Goldberg's Theorem\nA fundamental result, known as Goldberg's theorem (1956), states that when the BCH series terms $Z_n$ are expressed in a Hall basis, all the coefficients are non-zero. This means that $Z_n$ has a non-zero component for every basis vector of $L_n(X,Y)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-zero coefficients in the expansion of $Z_n$ is equal to the dimension of the vector space $L_n(X,Y)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Dimension of $L_{10}(X,Y)$ using Witt's Formula\nThe dimension of the homogeneous component of degree $n$ of a free Lie algebra on $m$ generators is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n$\\dim(L_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) m^{n/d}$\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the degree of the polynomials. In our case, $n=10$.\n*   $m$ is the number of generators. In our case, $m=2$ (for $X$ and $Y$).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Calculation for n=10\n1.  **Identify the parameters:** $n=10$, $m=2$.\n2.  **Find the divisors of n=10:** The divisors are $d = 1, 2, 5, 10$.\n3.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n4.  **Apply Witt's formula:**\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d \\in \\{1,2,5,10\\}} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10} \\right]$\n5.  **Substitute the values and compute:**\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^5 + (-1) \\cdot 2^2 + (1) \\cdot 2^1 \\right]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [1 \\cdot 1024 - 1 \\cdot 32 - 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [990]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = 99$\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on Goldberg's theorem, the number of non-zero coefficients in the order 10 BCH expansion is equal to the dimension of the space of Lie polynomials of degree 10 with two generators. This dimension is calculated using Witt's formula to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
