    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial campaign.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates. This means the individuals must have won a Nobel Prize or the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, either before or after the commercial aired.\n    *   **What:** They were featured in a commercial.\n    *   **Which Company:** Enron.\n    *   **When:** In or around the year 2000.\n    *   **What Tagline:** \"Ask Why\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Ad Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major corporate image initiative by Enron in 2000. The campaign's goal was to rebrand Enron from an energy pipeline company into a global, innovative powerhouse of ideas and technology. The commercials featured various experts and thinkers discussing the future of different industries.\n\n3.  **Identify the First Nobel Laureate:**\n    *   Research into the \"Ask Why\" commercials quickly reveals the participation of **Paul Krugman**.\n    *   In his commercial, Krugman, then a professor at MIT, discussed the revolutionary impact of bandwidth and the internet on economics.\n    *   **Careful Point:** At the time of the commercial in 2000, Paul Krugman was not yet a Nobel laureate. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. However, the question asks which \"Nobel laureates\" were featured, a status he now holds, making him a correct answer.\n\n4.  **Identify the Second Nobel Laureate:**\n    *   Further investigation of the same \"Ask Why\" campaign series reveals another prominent economist.\n    *   **Merton Miller**, a professor from the University of Chicago, also appeared in a separate commercial for the campaign. He spoke about risk management.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Unlike Krugman, Merton Miller was already a Nobel laureate when the commercial was filmed. He had won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990. He passed away in June 2000, the same year the campaign aired.\n\n5.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   Both Paul Krugman and Merton Miller were economists who participated in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign.\n    *   Both individuals are Nobel laureates in Economic Sciences (Miller winning in 1990, Krugman in 2008).\n    *   The ads became infamous after Enron's spectacular collapse in 2001, making the \"visionary\" and \"trust us\" message of the campaign deeply ironic.\n\nThe two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" campaign were Paul Krugman and Merton Miller.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
