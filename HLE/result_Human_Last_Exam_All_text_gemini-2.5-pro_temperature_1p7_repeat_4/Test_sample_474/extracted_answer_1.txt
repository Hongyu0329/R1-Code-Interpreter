No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is to provide a warning signal to natural predators, such as birds. Avian visual systems are fundamentally different from human vision, most notably in their ability to perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which is a component of many bee color patterns. Using human observers and standard photographs that do not capture UV information creates a critical mismatch. The results would be based on human-perceived similarity, which is not an ecologically relevant proxy for predator-perceived similarity, and thus the resulting clusters would not reliably reflect the functional mimicry syndromes that have evolved under predator selection pressure.
