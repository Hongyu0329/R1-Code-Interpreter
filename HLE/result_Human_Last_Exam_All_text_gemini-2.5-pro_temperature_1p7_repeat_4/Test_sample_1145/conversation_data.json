    "### Analysis of the Question\nThe user wants to find the probability of a particle being in a specific small interval within a 1D infinite potential well (a \"box\").\n1.  **System:** Particle in a 1D box of length 'a'. The potential is 0 inside the box (from x=0 to x=a) and infinite outside.\n2.  **State:** The particle is in the second energy state, which corresponds to the principal quantum number n = 2.\n3.  **Interval:** The particle's location is sought in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a.\n4.  **Objective:** Calculate the probability, which is found by integrating the probability density over this interval.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Wavefunction vs. Probability Density:** The probability is not given by the wavefunction ψ(x) itself, but by the probability density, which is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, |ψ(x)|².\n2.  **Correct Wavefunction:** We must use the normalized wavefunction for the correct quantum state, which is n=2.\n3.  **Location of the Interval:** The interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is centered precisely at x = 0.5a or a/2.\n4.  **Nodes of the Wavefunction:** For the n=2 state, the wavefunction has a node (a point of zero amplitude) at x = a/2. This means that the probability density is exactly zero at the center of the integration interval.\n5.  **Failure of Simple Approximation:** A common approximation for finding the probability in a very small interval is `P ≈ P(center) * Δx`. Because the probability density is zero at the center of this interval, this simple approximation would incorrectly yield a probability of 0. A full integration is required.\n6.  **Numerical Precision:** The direct calculation involves subtracting two numbers that are very close to each other. This can lead to \"catastrophic cancellation\" or significant round-off errors if not handled carefully. Using Taylor series expansions for the resulting trigonometric functions helps maintain precision.\n\n---\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**Step 1: Define the Probability Density Function**\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box for state 'n' is:\n$$ \\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right) $$\nFor the state n = 2, the wavefunction is:\n$$ \\psi_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) $$\nThe probability density, P(x), is given by |ψ₂(x)|²:\n$$ P(x) = \\left|\\psi_2(x)\\right|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) $$\n\n**Step 2: Set up the Probability Integral**\n\nThe probability (Prob) of finding the particle between x₁ = 0.495a and x₂ = 0.505a is the integral of the probability density over this range:\n$$ \\text{Prob} = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} P(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\,dx $$\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric power-reduction identity: `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2`.\nHere, `θ = 2πx/a`, so the integral becomes:\n$$ \\text{Prob} = \\frac{2}{a} \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) \\,dx $$\n$$ \\text{Prob} = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) \\,dx $$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Integral**\n\nWe perform the integration:\n$$ \\text{Prob} = \\frac{1}{a} \\left[ x - \\frac{a}{4\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\right]_{0.495a}^{0.505a} $$\nNow, we substitute the limits of integration:\n$$ \\text{Prob} = \\frac{1}{a} \\left\\{ \\left(0.505a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi (0.505a)}{a}\\right)\\right) - \\left(0.495a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi (0.495a)}{a}\\right)\\right) \\right\\} $$\n$$ \\text{Prob} = \\frac{1}{a} \\left\\{ (0.505a - 0.495a) - \\frac{a}{4\\pi}\\left[\\sin(2.02\\pi) - \\sin(1.98\\pi)\\right] \\right\\} $$\n$$ \\text{Prob} = \\frac{0.01a}{a} - \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left[\\sin(2.02\\pi) - \\sin(1.98\\pi)\\right] $$\n$$ \\text{Prob} = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left[\\sin(2.02\\pi) - \\sin(1.98\\pi)\\right] $$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify Trigonometric Terms and Calculate the Final Value**\n\nWe use the properties `sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ)` and `sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ)`.\n*   `sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)`\n*   `sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)`\n\nSubstituting these back:\n$$ \\text{Prob} = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left[\\sin(0.02\\pi) - (-\\sin(0.02\\pi))\\right] $$\n$$ \\text{Prob} = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left[2\\sin(0.02\\pi)\\right] = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin(0.02\\pi) $$\nThe angle `0.02π` is small, so we can use the Taylor expansion for `sin(θ) ≈ θ - θ³/6` to avoid numerical precision errors from the subtraction of nearly equal numbers.\n$$ \\text{Prob} \\approx 0.01 - \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left( (0.02\\pi) - \\frac{(0.02\\pi)^3}{6} \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Prob} \\approx 0.01 - \\left( \\frac{0.02\\pi}{2\\pi} - \\frac{(0.02\\pi)^3}{12\\pi} \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Prob} \\approx 0.01 - \\left( 0.01 - \\frac{0.000008\\pi^3}{12\\pi} \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Prob} \\approx 0.01 - 0.01 + \\frac{0.000008\\pi^2}{12} $$\n$$ \\text{Prob} \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^{-6} \\times \\pi^2 $$\nUsing the value π² ≈ 9.8696:\n$$ \\text{Prob} \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9.8696 \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 6.5797 \\times 10^{-6} $$\n\nFinal answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures is 0.00000658.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
