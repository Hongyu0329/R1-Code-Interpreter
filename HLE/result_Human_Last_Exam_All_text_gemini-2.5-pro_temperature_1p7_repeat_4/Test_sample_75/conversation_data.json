    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Second Great War\":** The first step is to correctly identify which conflict the question refers to. In the official StarCraft lore, the conflicts are named as follows:\n    *   **The Great War:** The events of the original *StarCraft* game (2499-2500).\n    *   **The Brood War:** The events of the *StarCraft: Brood War* expansion, which immediately follows the Great War (2500). Often, the Great War and Brood War are collectively referred to as the first major galactic war.\n    *   **The Second Great War:** This term is commonly used by both fans and official sources (like Blizzard's story summaries) to refer to the overarching conflict depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date:** The Second Great War begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. The inciting incident is the Zerg Swarm's renewed invasion of Dominion space, as well as Jim Raynor's campaign against Arcturus Mengsk. These events are established to begin in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date:** The war's primary narrative arc revolves around the three races uniting against the fallen Xel'naga, Amon. This conflict reaches its definitive conclusion in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue, titled \"Into the Void,\" where Amon is finally destroyed by the combined forces of the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg. According to the official timeline, these events conclude in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:** The war starts in the year 2504 and ends in the year 2506.\n    *   *Wings of Liberty* events take place in 2504.\n    *   *Heart of the Swarm* events take place across 2504 and 2505.\n    *   *Legacy of the Void* events and its epilogue take place across 2505 and 2506.\n    The conflict spans a continuous period covering parts of three calendar years. This makes the total duration approximately two full years.\n\n5.  **Round Up as Required:** The question requires the answer to be in years and rounded up.\n    *   The calculated duration is approximately 2 years.\n    *   Even if the exact duration were slightly less (e.g., 1 year and 10 months), rounding up to the nearest whole year would result in 2. Since the duration is very close to 2 years, rounding up gives us 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Conflict Name:** It is crucial not to confuse the \"Second Great War\" (StarCraft II) with the \"Great War\" (the original StarCraft). They are distinct conflicts separated by four years of relative peace.\n*   **Timeline Accuracy:** The start and end years (2504 and 2506) are based on the canonical timeline established by Blizzard Entertainment through the games and official publications.\n*   **Rounding Instruction:** The instruction to \"round up\" is key. A duration of just over one year up to a full two years would all round up to 2.\n\nFollowing this detailed analysis, the duration of the Second Great War is approximately 2 years.\n\n<<<2>>>"
