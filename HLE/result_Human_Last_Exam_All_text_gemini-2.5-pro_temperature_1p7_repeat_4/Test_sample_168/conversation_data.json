    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Sound Source**\n\nThe question asks about hearing human muscle twitches. We first need to understand the acoustic properties of this sound.\n*   **What is it?** A muscle twitch is a small, involuntary contraction of muscle fibers.\n*   **What sound does it make?** When muscles contract, they vibrate. This vibration produces a very low-frequency sound, often referred to as a phonomyogram (PMG).\n*   **Frequency:** Research has shown that the dominant frequency of this sound is very low, typically around 25 Hz. This is at the very bottom of the typical human hearing range and falls into the category of infrasound for frequencies below 20 Hz.\n*   **Amplitude:** The sound is also of extremely low amplitude, meaning it is very, very quiet.\n\nSo, we are looking for an animal that can detect very quiet, very low-frequency sounds (around 25 Hz).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Hearing Capabilities of Each Answer Choice**\n\nLet's examine the hearing range and sensitivity of each animal listed.\n\n*   **A. Dog:** A dog's hearing range is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. They are excellent at hearing high-frequency sounds (ultrasound), which is why they can hear dog whistles that are silent to humans. However, their ability to hear low frequencies is worse than humans; they cannot hear sounds as low as 25 Hz. Therefore, a dog is unlikely to hear a muscle twitch.\n\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are famous for using high-frequency echolocation to navigate and find prey. Their hearing range is specialized for ultrasound, typically from 2,000 Hz to over 110,000 Hz. They are essentially deaf to the low-frequency range where muscle twitches occur. Therefore, a bat cannot hear a muscle twitch.\n\n*   **C. Herring:** This is a surprisingly complex case. Herring (and related fish in the clupeid family) have a unique and highly sensitive auditory system. They have a connection from their swim bladder (an air-filled sac used for buoyancy) to their inner ear. The swim bladder acts like a drum, amplifying sound pressure vibrations and transmitting them to the ear. This gives them an exceptionally broad and sensitive hearing range. They can detect sounds from very low frequencies (below 30 Hz) all the way up to high-frequency ultrasound (up to 180,000 Hz). This remarkable sensitivity is thought to allow them to detect the minute vibrations of their prey, such as the muscle movements of tiny copepods (small crustaceans). If they can hear the muscle movements of a copepod, they could certainly hear the much larger muscle twitch of a human.\n\n*   **D. Whale:** Whales have hearing adapted for the aquatic environment. Baleen whales (like blue whales and fin whales) are specialists in low-frequency communication, producing and hearing sounds in the 10 Hz to 30 Hz range. This makes them a plausible candidate. However, their hearing is adapted for very loud sounds that travel over vast oceanic distances, not necessarily for extreme sensitivity to very faint, close-range sounds.\n\n*   **E. Human:** The typical human hearing range is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. A muscle twitch sound at ~25 Hz is at the very threshold of our frequency detection. More importantly, the sound is far too quiet (low amplitude) for our ears to perceive. Most people are unaware that their muscles make any sound at all.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Plausible Candidates and Conclude**\n\nWe have eliminated the dog, bat, and human. We are left with the whale and the herring.\n\n*   The **whale** can hear in the correct frequency range.\n*   The **herring** can also hear in the correct frequency range but possesses a specialized system that provides extreme sensitivity to faint pressure waves.\n\nThe key is the *sensitivity* required. A muscle twitch is an incredibly faint sound. The herring's known ability to detect the minute movements of its tiny prey strongly suggests it possesses the necessary sensitivity. While a baleen whale is a low-frequency specialist, its system is built for powerful, long-range signals, whereas the herring's is adapted for detecting faint, nearby stimuli for survival (finding food, avoiding predators). Therefore, the herring is the most likely animal on the list to be able to detect the faint, low-frequency sound of a human muscle twitch.\n\n<<<C>>>"
