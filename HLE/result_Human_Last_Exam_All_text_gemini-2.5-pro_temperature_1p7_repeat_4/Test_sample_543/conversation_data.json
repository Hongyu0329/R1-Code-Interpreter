    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and its IUPAC name.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene. This is a benzene ring with three halogen substituents. The structure is a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1, an iodine at position 2, and another bromine at position 3.\n*   **Reagent:** Phenyl magnesium bromide (C₆H₅MgBr or PhMgBr). This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a strong nucleophile (source of the phenyl anion, Ph⁻) and a strong base.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** \"Excess\" phenyl magnesium bromide is used. This implies that the reagent is not the limiting factor and the reaction will proceed as far as possible.\n*   **Solvent and Temperature:** The reaction is carried out in refluxing THF (tetrahydrofuran). Refluxing indicates that the reaction is heated to the boiling point of the solvent, providing energy to overcome activation barriers for less reactive sites.\n*   **Work-up:** An \"aqueous work-up\" is performed after the reaction. This step is used to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent and to hydrolyze magnesium salts into water-soluble byproducts, allowing for the isolation of the organic product. It does not typically alter the structure of the main organic product formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reactivity of the Substrate**\nThe substrate, 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, has three potential sites for reaction with the Grignard reagent: the carbon atom bonded to iodine (C2) and the two carbon atoms bonded to bromine (C1 and C3).\n\nThe reaction is a Grignard cross-coupling reaction. The reactivity of aryl halides in such reactions depends on the carbon-halogen (C-X) bond strength. The bond strength follows the order C-F > C-Cl > C-Br > C-I. Consequently, the reactivity towards substitution is the reverse:\n**Ar-I > Ar-Br > Ar-Cl > Ar-F**\n\nThe C-I bond is the weakest and therefore the most reactive site on the substrate. The C-Br bonds are less reactive but can still be substituted, especially with excess reagent and heat (refluxing conditions).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Reaction Sequence**\n1.  **First Substitution:** Due to the higher reactivity of the C-I bond, the first equivalent of phenyl magnesium bromide will attack the carbon at position 2, displacing the iodide ion.\n    *   Product after first step: 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n\n2.  **Second and Third Substitutions:** The problem states that an *excess* of phenyl magnesium bromide is used and the reaction is refluxed. These conditions are sufficient to make the less reactive C-Br bonds react. The excess Grignard reagent will proceed to substitute both bromine atoms with phenyl groups.\n    *   Reacting with 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene, the two bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 are replaced by two more phenyl groups.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Product**\nStarting with a benzene ring, the substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3 (originally Br, I, Br) are all replaced by phenyl groups. The final product is a central benzene ring connected to three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name of the Final Product**\n*   **Parent Structure:** The central ring is a benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:** There are three phenyl (C₆H₅) groups attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Prefix for Number of Substituents:** The prefix for three identical substituents is \"tri-\".\n*   **Locants (Positions):** The phenyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, and 3 of the benzene ring.\n*   **Combining the parts:** The full IUPAC name is **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   The relative reactivity of aryl halides (I > Br > Cl) is the key principle to determine the sequence of reactions.\n*   The term \"excess\" reagent is crucial; it indicates that the reaction will not stop after the most reactive site has reacted.\n*   \"Refluxing\" conditions provide the necessary energy for the less favorable reactions (substitution of C-Br bonds) to occur.\n*   The aqueous work-up is a standard procedure for isolating the product from a Grignard reaction and does not change the final organic product's structure.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
