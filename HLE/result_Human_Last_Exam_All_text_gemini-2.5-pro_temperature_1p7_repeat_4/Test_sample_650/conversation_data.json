    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Algorithm:**\n    The algorithm can be broken down into three main parts:\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization.** This part executes once before the loop begins.\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop.** This is the core of the algorithm, and its execution time depends on how many times it iterates.\n    *   **Step 3: The `return` statement.** This executes once after the loop finishes.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Step 1 (Initialization):**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n;`: These are two simple assignment operations.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: This involves one division and one floor operation.\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;`: This involves one multiplication and one subtraction.\n    *   All these operations are basic arithmetic and assignment operations. Assuming that the numbers `n` and `c` fit into a standard machine word (e.g., 64-bit integer), each of these operations takes a constant amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of the initialization step is **O(1)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Step 2 (The `while` loop):**\n    The total time spent in the loop is the number of iterations multiplied by the time taken for each iteration.\n    *   **Time per iteration:** The body of the loop (Step 2.1) consists of the following operations:\n        *   `i := i + 1;`: One increment.\n        *   `x := q;`: One assignment.\n        *   `q :=. ⌊x/c⌋;`: One division and one floor operation.\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc`: One multiplication and one subtraction.\n        *   Similar to the initialization step, these are all constant-time operations. So, the time complexity for a single iteration of the loop is **O(1)**.\n    *   **Number of iterations:** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. We need to determine how many times `q` is divided by `c` before it becomes 0.\n        *   Initially, `q` is set to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   In the first iteration, the new `q` becomes `⌊(old q)/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   In the second iteration, the new `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations, the value of `q` is `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n        *   The loop terminates when this value of `q` becomes 0. Let `T` be the total number of iterations.\n        *   The loop condition `q > 0` must be true for the `T`-th iteration to run. The value of `q` checked at the beginning of the `T`-th iteration was calculated in the `(T-1)`-th iteration, so `q = ⌊n/c^T⌋ > 0`. This implies `n/c^T ≥ 1`, or `n ≥ c^T`.\n        *   After the `T`-th iteration, the new `q` becomes `⌊n/c^(T+1)⌋`, which must be 0 for the loop to terminate. This implies `n/c^(T+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(T+1)`.\n        *   Combining these two inequalities, we get: `c^T ≤ n < c^(T+1)`.\n        *   By taking the logarithm base `c` on all parts of the inequality, we get: `log_c(c^T) ≤ log_c(n) < log_c(c^(T+1))`, which simplifies to `T ≤ log_c(n) < T+1`.\n        *   This shows that the number of iterations, `T`, is equal to `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n    *   **Total time for the loop:** The total time is (Number of iterations) × (Time per iteration) = `⌊log_c(n)⌋ × O(1)`. Thus, the complexity of the loop is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Step 3 (Return):**\n    *   The algorithm returns a sequence of digits `(a_i, ..., a_0)`. The number of digits is `i+1`.\n    *   The variable `i` is incremented once for each loop iteration, starting from `i=0`. After `T = ⌊log_c(n)⌋` iterations, the final value of `i` will be `T`.\n    *   The length of the returned sequence is `T+1 = ⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`.\n    *   The time to construct and return this sequence is proportional to its length.\n    *   Therefore, the complexity of the return step is **O(⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1)**, which simplifies to **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n5.  **Overall Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity is the sum of the complexities of the individual parts:\n    `T(n) = O(1) [Initialization] + O(log_c(n)) [Loop] + O(log_c(n)) [Return]`\n    The dominant term in this sum is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Model of Computation:** We assume a standard model where basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on machine-sized integers take constant time, O(1). This is a common and reasonable assumption for complexity analysis unless arbitrary-precision arithmetic is specified.\n*   **Input Size:** The complexity is expressed as a function of the value of the input `n`, not the number of bits in `n`.\n*   **Role of Base `c`:** The number of iterations depends logarithmically on `n` with base `c`. For a fixed `c`, `log_c(n)` is proportional to `log n` (by the change of base formula), so the complexity class is `O(log n)`. However, `O(log_c(n))` is a more precise expression derived directly from the algorithm's mechanics.\n*   **Worst-Case Analysis:** The number of operations is solely determined by the magnitude of `n` and `c`, not by any particular properties of `n`. Therefore, this analysis applies to all inputs `n ≥ 0`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe algorithm essentially calculates each digit of the base-`c` representation of `n` by repeatedly dividing by `c`. The number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. Since each step to find a digit takes a constant number of operations, the total time complexity is directly proportional to the number of digits. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
