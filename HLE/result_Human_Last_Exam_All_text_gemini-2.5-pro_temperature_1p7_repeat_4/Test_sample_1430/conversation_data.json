    "This problem asks for the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power, $X = Sym^{15}(C)$, of a genus 3 Riemann surface $C$. The rank of the Néron-Severi group, $NS(X)$, is also known as the Picard number, denoted by $\\rho(X)$.\n\n**Step 1: Relate the Néron-Severi group of $X = Sym^n(C)$ to the Jacobian of C**\n\nThe variety $X = Sym^{15}(C)$ is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15. The key to understanding its Néron-Severi group is through its relation to the Jacobian variety of the curve $C$, denoted $J(C)$. $J(C)$ is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$.\n\nThe Albanese variety of $X=Sym^n(C)$ is the Jacobian $J(C)$. The Albanese map, $u_n: Sym^n(C) \\to J(C)$, is given by mapping a divisor $D = P_1 + \\dots + P_n$ to the class of $\\mathcal{O}_C(D - n P_0)$ in $J(C)$, where $P_0$ is a fixed base point on $C$.\n\nThe cohomology of symmetric powers of curves is well-understood. For $k=2$, the second cohomology group of $X$ can be decomposed in relation to the cohomology of $J(C)$. The map $u_n^*: H^*(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^*(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ induced by the Albanese map is injective. The decomposition is given by:\n$H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q} \\cdot W \\oplus u_n^* H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$\nHere, $W$ is the class of the divisor on $Sym^n(C)$ defined by $\\{ D \\in Sym^n(C) \\mid P_0 \\in \\text{supp}(D) \\}$ for a fixed point $P_0 \\in C$.\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(X)$, is the dimension of the subspace of $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ spanned by algebraic cycle classes of codimension 1. This space is $H^{1,1}(X) \\cap H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ by the Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem.\nThe class $W$ is algebraic and of Hodge type (1,1). The pullback map $u_n^*$ sends algebraic classes on $J(C)$ to algebraic classes on $X$. Therefore, the space of algebraic classes on $X$ is formed by $\\mathbb{Q} \\cdot W$ and the pullback of the algebraic classes from $J(C)$. This gives the crucial relation for the Picard numbers:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(Sym^n(C)) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\nThis relation holds for any $n \\ge 1$. In our case, $n=15$ and $g=3$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve $C$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the smallest possible rank of $NS(J(C))$**\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of a principally polarized abelian variety $(A, \\lambda)$ is always at least 1, as the polarization class $[\\lambda]$ is algebraic. So, $\\rho(J(C)) \\ge 1$.\nFor a *generic* Riemann surface $C$ of genus $g$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ has the minimal possible endomorphism ring, which is just the integers, $End(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. For such a Jacobian, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\nThus, for a generic genus 3 curve, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\nThis is the minimum possible value.\n\nThe smallest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is therefore:\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the largest possible rank of $NS(J(C))$**\n\nFinding the maximum Picard number for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve is a more profound problem.\nFor any abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$, the Picard number is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$. For $g=3$, we have $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\nEquality, $\\rho(A)=g^2$, can hold for some abelian threefolds, but these are not Jacobians of curves. A principally polarized abelian variety $(A, \\lambda)$ has $\\rho(A)=g^2$ if and only if it is isomorphic as a ppav to a product of $g$ isogenous CM elliptic curves with the product polarization. However, a fundamental result states that the Jacobian of an irreducible curve is always an indecomposable ppav. This rules out the case $\\rho(J(C))=9$.\nThe problem of finding the maximum $\\rho(J(C))$ depends on finding curves whose Jacobians have a large ring of endomorphisms (e.g., those with complex multiplication, CM).\nThis is a subject of specialized research. The consensus in the literature is that for a genus 3 curve $C$, the maximum possible value for the Picard number of its Jacobian is 7.\n$\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 7$.\nThis maximum value is achieved, for instance, by the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = 1$.\n\nThe largest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is therefore:\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 1 + 7 = 8$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = Sym^{15}(C)$ is given by $\\rho(X) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$.\n*   The minimum value of $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1, which occurs for a generic curve C. This gives the smallest rank $\\rho(X) = 1+1=2$.\n*   The maximum value of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve is 7. This gives the largest rank $\\rho(X) = 1+7=8$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 8.\n\n<<<2, 8>>>"
