    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a power subgroup and the structure of the group.**\n\n*   **Power Subgroup**: A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $n$ such that $H$ is the set of all $n$-th powers of elements in $G$. That is, $H = G^n = \\{g^n \\mid g \\in G\\}$. The set $G^n$ itself must form a subgroup.\n*   **Semidihedral Group**: The group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. The order is $512 = 2^9$. We denote this group by $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$.\n    The standard presentation of the semidihedral group $SD_{2^k}$ is:\n    $SD_{2^k} = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{2^{k-1}} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^{-1+2^{k-2}} \\rangle$.\n    For our case, $k=9$, so the group is $G = SD_{2^9}$ with the presentation:\n    $G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{256} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^{-1+128} = a^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $a^i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 255\\}$ and $a^i b$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 255\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the problem by classifying the exponents.**\n\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups of the form $G^n$ for an integer $n$.\nLet's write any integer $n$ as $n = 2^j \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd integer and $j \\ge 0$.\n\nThe set of $n$-th powers is $G^n = \\{g^n \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{(g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nConsider the map $\\phi_m: G \\to G$ defined by $\\phi_m(g) = g^m$. Since $G$ is a 2-group (all elements have orders that are powers of 2) and $m$ is odd, the map $\\phi_m$ is a permutation of the set $G$. This is because for any element $g \\in G$ with order $|g| = 2^p$, $\\gcd(m, |g|) = 1$, which implies the map $x \\mapsto x^m$ is an automorphism of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$. As this is true for all $g$, the map is a bijection on $G$.\n\nSince $\\phi_m$ permutes the elements of $G$, the set $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is the same as the set $G$.\nTherefore, $G^n = \\{(g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{h^{2^j} \\mid h \\in G\\} = G^{2^j}$.\nThis crucial simplification means we only need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the sequence $G^{2^0}, G^{2^1}, G^{2^2}, \\ldots$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the subgroups $G^{2^j}$ for $j \\ge 0$.**\n\nWe need to compute the sets $G^{2^j}$ and verify they are subgroups. $G^{2^j}$ is the union of the sets of powers of elements of the form $a^i$ and $a^i b$.\n\n*   **Powers of $a^i$**: The set of powers is $\\{(a^i)^{2^j} \\mid i = 0, \\ldots, 255\\} = \\{a^{i2^j}\\} = \\langle a^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n*   **Powers of $a^i b$**: We first compute the square of $a^i b$:\n    $(a^i b)^2 = a^i b a^i b$. From the relation $bab = a^{127}$, we can derive $ba^i = a^{127i}b$.\n    So, $(a^i b)^2 = a^i (ba^i) b = a^i (a^{127i}b) b = a^i a^{127i} b^2 = a^{128i}$.\n    Since the order of $a$ is 256, $a^{128i} = a^{i \\cdot 2^7}$.\n    Now, for $j \\ge 1$, we can find the $2^j$-th power:\n    $(a^i b)^{2^j} = ((a^i b)^2)^{2^{j-1}} = (a^{i2^7})^{2^{j-1}} = a^{i2^7 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = a^{i2^{j+6}}$.\n    The set of these powers is $\\{a^{i2^{j+6}} \\mid i = 0, \\ldots, 255\\} = \\langle a^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle$.\n\nCombining these results:\n*   For $j=0$: $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$. This is the group itself, which is a power subgroup.\n*   For $j \\ge 1$: $G^{2^j} = \\langle a^{2^j} \\rangle \\cup \\langle a^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle$.\n    Since $j+6 > j$, the cyclic subgroup $\\langle a^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\\langle a^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, their union is simply the larger subgroup: $G^{2^j} = \\langle a^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    This confirms that for any $j \\ge 1$, the set of powers $G^{2^j}$ is a subgroup.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of distinct power subgroups.**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups is $\\{G^{2^j} \\mid j \\ge 0\\}$. Let's list the distinct ones:\n1.  For $j=0$: $G^{2^0} = G$. The order is $|G|=512$.\n2.  For $j=1$: $G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\langle a^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256 / \\gcd(2, 256) = 256/2 = 128$.\n3.  For $j=2$: $G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\langle a^4 \\rangle$. Order is $256/4 = 64$.\n4.  For $j=3$: $G^{2^3} = G^8 = \\langle a^8 \\rangle$. Order is $256/8 = 32$.\n5.  For $j=4$: $G^{2^4} = G^{16} = \\langle a^{16} \\rangle$. Order is $256/16 = 16$.\n6.  For $j=5$: $G^{2^5} = G^{32} = \\langle a^{32} \\rangle$. Order is $256/32 = 8$.\n7.  For $j=6$: $G^{2^6} = G^{64} = \\langle a^{64} \\rangle$. Order is $256/64 = 4$.\n8.  For $j=7$: $G^{2^7} = G^{128} = \\langle a^{128} \\rangle$. Order is $256/128 = 2$.\n9.  For $j=8$: $G^{2^8} = G^{256} = \\langle a^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. This is the trivial subgroup, with order 1.\n\nFor any $j > 8$, $2^j$ is a multiple of 256. So, $\\langle a^{2^j} \\rangle = \\langle (a^{256})^{2^{j-8}} \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. Thus, for all $j \\ge 8$, we get the same trivial subgroup.\n\nThe list of distinct power subgroups is:\n$G, \\langle a^2 \\rangle, \\langle a^4 \\rangle, \\langle a^8 \\rangle, \\langle a^{16} \\rangle, \\langle a^{32} \\rangle, \\langle a^{64} \\rangle, \\langle a^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\nThese subgroups all have different orders (512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), so they are all distinct.\nCounting them, we find there are 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
