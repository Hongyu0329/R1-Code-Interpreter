    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Representation of Numbers in Red-Blue-Hackenbush**\n\nIn red-blue-Hackenbush, the values of games correspond to surreal numbers. Dyadic rationals (fractions of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$) have specific, finite representations. A standard method to represent such numbers is to use their binary expansion.\n\nAny positive dyadic rational $x$ can be written as a sum of powers of 2. For example, if $x = 2.75$, its binary representation is $10.11_2$, which corresponds to $2^1 + 2^{-1} + 2^{-2}$. In Hackenbush, the value of several games played side-by-side (i.e., not connected to each other, but all connected to the ground) is the sum of their individual values.\n\nThis means we can represent $x$ by constructing the games for each term in its binary expansion and placing them next to each other. The total number of pieces will be the sum of the pieces in each component game.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose $\\frac{13}{16}$ into its Binary Components**\n\nFirst, we write $\\frac{13}{16}$ as a sum of fractions of the form $\\frac{1}{2^n}$.\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} $$\nIn binary, this is $0.1101_2$.\nThe Hackenbush game for $\\frac{13}{16}$, which we'll call $G_{13/16}$, can be constructed as the sum of the games for its components:\n$$ G_{13/16} = G_{1/2} + G_{1/4} + G_{1/16} $$\nThe total number of pieces will be the sum of the pieces needed for each of these three games.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Hackenbush Representation for $G_{1/2^n}$**\n\nWe need to find a general construction for the game representing $1/2^n$. Let's analyze the first few cases. The players are Left (removes red edges) and Right (removes blue edges). The value of a game is written as {set of values of Left's options | set of values of Right's options}.\n\n*   **Game for 1/2 ($n=1$):** The value is $\\{0|1\\}$. This can be constructed with a red edge at the bottom and a blue edge on top (an R-B stalk).\n    *   If Left cuts the red edge, the whole structure is removed, leaving a game of value 0.\n    *   If Right cuts the blue edge, the red edge remains, leaving a game of value 1.\n    *   Thus, the value is $\\{0|1\\}=1/2$.\n    *   This construction uses **2 pieces** (1 red, 1 blue).\n\n*   **Game for 1/4 ($n=2$):** The value is $\\{0|1/2\\}$. This suggests Left's move leads to a game of value 0, and Right's move leads to a game of value 1/2 (i.e., the game $G_{1/2}$). Let's try constructing this with a single stalk. The game for $1/4$ is a red edge at the bottom with two blue edges on top (an R-B-B stalk).\n    *   Left's only move is to cut the bottom red edge, which results in a value of 0.\n    *   Right can cut the lower blue edge, leaving an R-B stalk (value 1/2). Right can also cut the upper blue edge, leaving a single red edge (value 1).\n    *   The value is $\\{0 | 1/2, 1\\}$. The simplest number between 0 and 1/2 is $1/4$.\n    *   This construction uses **3 pieces** (1 red, 2 blue).\n\n*   **Generalizing for $1/2^n$:** Following this pattern, the game for $1/2^n$ is a stalk with one red edge at the bottom and $n$ blue edges on top of it.\n    *   Left's only move is to cut the red edge, yielding a value of 0.\n    *   Right can cut any of the $n$ blue edges. Cutting the $k$-th blue edge from the bottom leaves a stalk of one red and $k-1$ blue edges, which is the game for $1/2^{k-1}$.\n    *   The value of this game is $\\{0 | 1, 1/2, 1/4, ..., 1/2^{n-1}\\}$. The simplest number in this range is $1/2^n$.\n    *   The number of pieces for the game $G_{1/2^n}$ is $1$ (for the red edge) + $n$ (for the blue edges), which is **$n+1$ pieces**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Pieces**\n\nNow we apply this formula to the components of $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n*   For the $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2^1}$ component ($n=1$): Number of pieces = $1+1 = 2$.\n*   For the $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2^2}$ component ($n=2$): Number of pieces = $2+1 = 3$.\n*   For the $\\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2^4}$ component ($n=4$): Number of pieces = $4+1 = 5$.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed to represent $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the sum of the pieces for these three component games.\n\nTotal pieces = (pieces for 1/2) + (pieces for 1/4) + (pieces for 1/16)\nTotal pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$."
