    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene** (specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene, which provides four π-electrons for the reaction. For the reaction to occur, it must adopt an s-cis conformation.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is a substituted alkene. The chlorine and fluorine atoms are strongly electron-withdrawing, making this alkene electron-poor. An electron-poor alkene is an excellent dienophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, a type of pericyclic reaction that forms a six-membered ring in a single, concerted step.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Basic Structure of the Product**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring. In this case, it will be a cyclohexene derivative.\n*   The four carbons from butadiene (C1, C2, C3, C4) and the two carbons from the dienophile form the ring.\n*   A new double bond is formed between C2 and C3 of the original diene.\n*   Two new single (sigma) bonds are formed: one between C1 of the diene and one carbon of the dienophile, and the other between C4 of the diene and the other carbon of the dienophile.\n*   The substituents on the dienophile (two Cl atoms and two F atoms) remain attached to their respective carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Regiochemistry**\n*   **Regiochemistry** refers to the orientation of the reactants relative to each other, which determines which of several possible structural isomers (regioisomers) is formed.\n*   The diene, 1,3-butadiene, is symmetrical.\n*   The dienophile, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, is unsymmetrical because one carbon is bonded to two fluorine atoms (CF₂) and the other to two chlorine atoms (CCl₂).\n*   Because the dienophile is unsymmetrical, two different regioisomers are possible, depending on how it aligns with the diene.\n    *   **Isomer A:** C1 of butadiene bonds to the CF₂ carbon, and C4 of butadiene bonds to the CCl₂ carbon.\n    *   **Isomer B:** C1 of butadiene bonds to the CCl₂ carbon, and C4 of butadiene bonds to the CF₂ carbon.\n    *   Since C1 and C4 of butadiene are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, these two possibilities lead to the formation of a single major product, dictated by electronic preferences. We need to determine which carbon of the dienophile is more reactive.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Major Product using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory**\n*   The regioselectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction is controlled by the interaction between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile.\n*   The reaction occurs through the pathway where the atoms with the largest orbital coefficients in the HOMO and LUMO overlap.\n*   **Diene HOMO:** In 1,3-butadiene, the HOMO has its largest coefficients on the terminal carbons (C1 and C4). These are the most nucleophilic positions of the diene.\n*   **Dienophile LUMO:** In CCl₂=CF₂, we need to determine which carbon has the larger LUMO coefficient. The LUMO's coefficients are larger on the more electron-deficient carbon atom(s).\n    *   Both fluorine and chlorine are strongly electron-withdrawing via the inductive effect (-I). Fluorine is the most electronegative element, so its inductive effect is stronger than chlorine's (-I effect: F > Cl).\n    *   This strong inductive withdrawal by the two fluorine atoms makes the CF₂ carbon more electron-deficient (more δ+) than the CCl₂ carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the LUMO of the dienophile will have a larger coefficient on the CF₂ carbon.\n*   **Prediction:** The most favorable interaction is between a terminal carbon of the diene's HOMO (e.g., C4) and the carbon with the largest coefficient in the dienophile's LUMO (the CF₂ carbon). Consequently, the other terminal carbon of the diene (C1) will bond to the CCl₂ carbon.\n\n**Step 5: Draw and Name the Final Product**\n*   Based on the FMO analysis, the bonds form as: C1(diene)–C(Cl₂) and C4(diene)–C(F₂). (Note: since the diene is symmetrical, this is equivalent to C1–C(F₂) and C4–C(Cl₂), leading to the same product).\n*   Let's trace the atoms to form the structure: The ring contains the sequence -CH=CH–CH₂–C(F₂)₂–C(Cl)₂–CH₂-.\n*   Let's draw this structure as a cyclohexene ring and name it according to IUPAC rules.\n    1.  The parent name is **cyclohexene**.\n    2.  The double bond is assigned positions 1 and 2.\n    3.  We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The substituents are on adjacent carbons, which will be positions 4 and 5. The locant set is {4,4,5,5} regardless of numbering direction around the C=C bond.\n    4.  When there is a tie in locant sets, we use alphabetical order of the substituents to assign the numbering. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically. Therefore, the CCl₂ group should be given the lower number.\n    5.  Following the connectivity from our prediction (C4(diene)–C(F₂) and C1(diene)–C(Cl₂)), we can number the ring such that the CCl₂ group is at position 4 and the CF₂ group is at position 5.\n\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n          / \\\n     Cl2C---F2C\n      /      \\\n     CH2      CH2\n      \\      /\n       HC==CH\n    ```\n*   The IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nThe final product is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
