    "An internal adjunction in the 2-category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ consists of a pair of morphisms (non-decreasing maps) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ such that $L$ is left adjoint to $R$.\n\nHere, we are asked for the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$, so we have $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understanding the structure of $\\Delta$ and internal adjunctions**\n\n*   The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite totally ordered sets $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n*   The morphisms $f: [m] \\to [n]$ are non-decreasing functions.\n*   $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-category. This means that for any two morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. We denote this by $f \\le g$.\n*   An adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a pair of morphisms $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ along with a unit $\\eta: id_{[m]} \\to R \\circ L$ and a counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to id_{[n]}$ satisfying certain identities.\n*   In this posetal context, the existence of the unit and counit 2-morphisms simplifies to the following pointwise inequalities:\n    1.  $id_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$, which means $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n    2.  $L \\circ R \\le id_{[n]}$, which means $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n    (The triangle identities for the adjunction hold automatically in any posetal 2-category).\n\n**2. Equivalence to Galois Connections**\n\nThe two conditions derived above are precisely the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$. This is often expressed in the equivalent form:\nFor all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$,\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint $L$ or the right adjoint $R$. Thus, we can count the number of adjunctions by counting the number of possible left adjoints or by counting the number of possible right adjoints.\n\n**3. Counting by Left Adjoints ($L$)**\n\nA non-decreasing map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). For maps between totally ordered sets, this is equivalent to two conditions:\n1.  $L$ is non-decreasing. (This is already required for it to be a morphism in $\\Delta$).\n2.  $L$ preserves the bottom element, i.e., $L(0_{[m]}) = 0_{[n]}$.\n\nIn our case, with $L: [23] \\to [37]$, this means $L$ must be a non-decreasing map with the property $L(0) = 0$.\n\nSo we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ satisfying:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $L(0)$ is fixed as 0, we need to choose the values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. These are 23 values to be chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $38$ elements. The choice is with replacement, and the non-decreasing condition means that the multiset of chosen values uniquely determines the sequence.\n\nThis is a combination with repetition problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{n \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n\n*   Number of items to choose, $k = 23$ (for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$).\n*   Number of options for each choice, $n = 38$ (the values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$).\n\nThe number of such maps $L$ is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**4. Counting by Right Adjoints ($R$) (for verification)**\n\nA non-decreasing map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets (infima). For maps between totally ordered sets, this is equivalent to:\n1.  $R$ is non-decreasing.\n2.  $R$ preserves the top element, i.e., $R(n_{[n]}) = m_{[m]}$.\n\nIn our case, with $R: [37] \\to [23]$, this means $R$ must be a non-decreasing map with the property $R(37)=23$.\n\nSo we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37)$ satisfying:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le R(37) = 23$.\n\nSince $R(37)$ is fixed as 23, we need to choose the values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$. These are 37 values to be chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has $24$ elements.\n\nThis is another combination with repetition problem.\n*   Number of items to choose, $k = 37$ (for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$).\n*   Number of options for each choice, $n = 24$ (the values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$).\n\nThe number of such maps $R$ is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nUsing the identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which confirms the analysis.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   The definition of an internal adjunction in a locally posetal 2-category simplifies to two inequalities, which are equivalent to the definition of a Galois connection.\n*   A map between finite total orders is a left adjoint iff it is non-decreasing and preserves the minimum element (0).\n*   A map between finite total orders is a right adjoint iff it is non-decreasing and preserves the maximum element.\n*   The counting problem reduces to a standard \"combinations with repetition\" problem, for which the formula is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$. It is crucial to correctly identify $n$ (the number of available options) and $k$ (the number of choices to make).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe number of internal adjunctions is the number of valid left-adjoint maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\nThis is the number of non-decreasing sequences $0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nWe are choosing 23 values (for $L(1)$ through $L(23)$) from the set of 38 values $\\{0, 1, ..., 37\\}$.\nThe number of ways is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<$ \\binom{60}{23} $>>>"
