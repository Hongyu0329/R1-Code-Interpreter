    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Landmark:** Pantheon church.\n    *   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** Removed by the city administration.\n    *   **Timeline:** Removed in 1950.\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Elimination:**\n    *   The most prominent features of the piazza today are the Pantheon itself and the Fontana del Pantheon (Fountain of the Pantheon) with its central obelisk. These have not been removed.\n    *   Another famous feature associated with the Pantheon were the two bell towers added by Bernini in the 17th century, nicknamed the \"donkey's ears\" (orecchie d'asino). However, these were removed in the late 19th century (around 1883), which does not match the 1950 timeline.\n\n3.  **Investigating Changes around 1950:**\n    *   Historical research and photographs of Rome from the late 19th and early 20th centuries show a significant piece of urban infrastructure in the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    *   This infrastructure was related to the city's public transportation system.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Specific Feature:**\n    *   From 1895 until the post-WWII era, a tramway line ran directly through the piazza.\n    *   The \"unique architectural feature\" in this context was a **tramway ring** or loop of tracks that was built around the central fountain.\n    *   This ring was a very distinctive and modern (for its time) element imposed on the ancient square. It allowed the trams to navigate and turn around the central fountain, creating a striking visual contrast between ancient, Renaissance, and modern industrial elements.\n\n5.  **Confirming the Removal:**\n    *   Following World War II, the Rome city administration undertook a major project to remove the tramways from the historic center. This was done to \"restore\" the historical appearance of famous squares and to better accommodate the rise of automobile traffic.\n    *   The tramway ring in Piazza della Rotonda was dismantled as part of this city-wide project. The year 1950 is within the precise timeframe when these lines were being decommissioned and removed. This action was indeed carried out by the city administration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe unique feature in question was the circular tram track that looped around the central fountain of the piazza, which was removed by the city in the mid-20th century.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Definition of \"Architectural Feature\":** While one might think of buildings, a prominent and defining piece of urban infrastructure like a custom-built tramway loop can certainly be classified as an architectural or structural feature of a square's design for the period it existed.\n*   **Precise Dating:** The removal of tram lines was a process. While 1950 is the cited year, the work might have begun slightly earlier or finished slightly later, but it falls squarely in the correct historical period.\n*   **Distinguishing from other features:** It is important to distinguish this from other historical changes, like the removal of the Bernini bell towers, which happened much earlier.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is clear.\n\n<<<A tramway ring that circled the central fountain.>>>"
