    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects a specific set of lines.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition on the Convex Domain\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. We are given a family of lines `L_pq` with equations `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`). The condition is that `K` must have a non-empty intersection with every such line `L_pq`.\n\nA line `L` divides the plane into two open half-planes. A convex set `K` intersects `L` if and only if `K` is not entirely contained in either of these open half-planes.\nLet the equation of the line be `f(x, y) = 1`, where `f(x, y) = px + qy`. The two open half-planes are `px + qy > 1` and `px + qy < 1`.\n\nThe condition that `K` intersects `L_pq` means:\n1.  There must be a point `(x, y)` in `K` such that `px + qy ≥ 1`. This implies `sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≥ 1`.\n2.  There must be a point `(x, y)` in `K` such that `px + qy ≤ 1`. This implies `inf_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≤ 1`.\n\nSo, for all coprime integers `p` and `q`, we must have:\n`inf_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy)`\n\n### Step 2: Strengthening the Condition using Symmetry\n\nThe set of coprime integer pairs `(p, q)` is symmetric. If `(p, q)` is a pair of coprime integers, then so is `(-p, -q)`. Therefore, the condition must also hold for the line `(-p)x + (-q)y = 1`.\n\nApplying the condition from Step 1 to the pair `(-p, -q)`:\n`inf_{(x,y)∈K} (-px - qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{(x,y)∈K} (-px - qy)`\n\nLet's analyze the terms:\n*   `inf(-px - qy) = -sup(px + qy)`\n*   `sup(-px - qy) = -inf(px + qy)`\n\nSubstituting these back into the inequality gives:\n`-sup(px + qy) ≤ 1` which implies `sup(px + qy) ≥ -1`.\n`-inf(px + qy) ≥ 1` which implies `inf(px + qy) ≤ -1`.\n\nNow we combine the conditions for `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`:\n*   From `(p, q)`: `sup(px + qy) ≥ 1`.\n*   From `(-p, -q)`: `inf(px + qy) ≤ -1`.\nThe other two inequalities (`inf ≤ 1` and `sup ≥ -1`) are weaker and thus redundant.\n\nSo, the necessary and sufficient condition on `K` is:\nFor all coprime integers `p` and `q`,\n`sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≥ 1` and `inf_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≤ -1`.\n\n### Step 3: Relating the Condition to the Width of the Domain\n\nThe *width* of a convex domain `K` in the direction of a vector `v = (p, q)` is defined as `W(v) = sup_{x∈K}(v⋅x) - inf_{x∈K}(v⋅x)`.\nUsing our condition from Step 2:\n`W(p, q) = sup(px + qy) - inf(px + qy) ≥ 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\nThis must hold for all coprime integer pairs `(p, q)`. Let's consider some specific pairs:\n*   **For (p, q) = (1, 0):** `W(1, 0) ≥ 2`. `W(1, 0)` is the width of `K` in the x-direction, which is `w_x = sup(x) - inf(x)`. So, `w_x ≥ 2`.\n*   **For (p, q) = (0, 1):** `W(0, 1) ≥ 2`. `W(0, 1)` is the width of `K` in the y-direction, `w_y = sup(y) - inf(y)`. So, `w_y ≥ 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding a Lower Bound for the Area\n\nThere is a classical result in convex geometry relating the area of a convex body to its widths in orthogonal directions. For a convex domain `K` with width `w_x` in the x-direction and `w_y` in the y-direction, its area is bounded below:\n`Area(K) ≥ (1/2) * w_x * w_y`.\nThis minimum is achieved by a triangle.\n\nUsing the minimum widths we found in Step 3 (`w_x ≥ 2` and `w_y ≥ 2`):\n`Area(K) ≥ (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\nThis means the minimal area of any such convex domain cannot be less than 2.\n\n### Step 5: Finding a Candidate Domain and Verifying It\n\nNow we need to check if this lower bound of 2 can be achieved. We look for a convex domain `K` that satisfies the conditions and has an area of 2.\n\nConsider the domain `D` defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\nThis domain is a square with vertices at `(1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(-1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)`.\n\n*   **Area of D**: The square has diagonals of length 2. Its area is `(1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n*   **Verification of the condition**: We need to check if for `D`, `sup(px+qy) ≥ 1` and `inf(px+qy) ≤ -1` for all coprime `(p,q)`.\n    The expression `px + qy` is a linear function. Its supremum and infimum over the convex polygon `D` will be attained at one of its vertices. Let's check the value of `px + qy` at the vertices:\n    *   `(1, 0)`: `p`\n    *   `(0, 1)`: `q`\n    *   `(-1, 0)`: `-p`\n    *   `(0, -1)`: `-q`\n    So, `sup_D(px + qy) = max(p, -p, q, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    And `inf_D(px + qy) = min(p, -p, q, -q) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\n    The condition on `D` becomes `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` and `-max(|p|, |q|) ≤ -1`, which is equivalent to `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n    Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero.\n    *   If `p ≠ 0`, then `|p| ≥ 1`, so `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n    *   If `q ≠ 0`, then `|q| ≥ 1`, so `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n    The condition `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` holds for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that any convex domain `K` satisfying the given property must have an area of at least 2. We have also found a specific convex domain, `D = {(x,y) : |x|+|y| ≤ 1}`, which has an area of exactly 2 and satisfies the property.\nTherefore, the minimal area is 2."
