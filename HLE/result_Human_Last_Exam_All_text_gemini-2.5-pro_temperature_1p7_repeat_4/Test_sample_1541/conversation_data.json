    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient solution and calculate the memory usage.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe core task is to take an input string representing a sum of numbers (e.g., \"3+2+1+4+1\") and rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order, printing the new sum (e.g., \"1+1+2+3+4\"). The numbers in the sum are guaranteed to be only 1, 2, 3, or 4. The main constraint is to devise a C program that is as **memory-efficient** as possible.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Careful Points and Devise a Strategy\n\n1.  **Sorting Method:** A general-purpose sorting algorithm like quicksort is unnecessary. Since the numbers are limited to a very small and fixed set {1, 2, 3, 4}, the most efficient sorting method is **Counting Sort**. We can simply count the occurrences of each number.\n\n2.  **Input Handling:** The input string can be up to 1000 characters long. A naive approach would be to read the entire string into a character array, for example, `char s[1001]`. This would consume over 1000 bytes. To be memory-efficient, we should avoid storing the entire string. We can read the input one character at a time and process it immediately.\n\n3.  **Data Storage:** Instead of storing all the numbers from the input, we only need to store the *frequency* of each number. Since there are only four possible numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), we can use an array of 4 integers to store these counts. This requires a small, constant amount of memory, regardless of the input length.\n\n4.  **Output Generation:** To be maximally memory-efficient, we should not build the output string in a separate memory buffer. Instead, we can print the parts of the sum directly to the console. We will iterate through our counts for '1's, then '2's, etc., and print the number and the `+` symbol as needed. We need a simple flag to ensure a `+` is not printed before the very first number.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer (Memory Calculation)\n\nFollowing the memory-efficient strategy, let's identify the exact variables needed for the C program and calculate their total size. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n1.  **Frequency Counter Array:** We need an array to store the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   Variable: `int counts[4];`\n    *   Memory: `4 * sizeof(int) = 4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n\n2.  **Input Character:** To read the input character by character without storing the whole string, we need one variable.\n    *   Variable: `char ch;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n3.  **Loop Iterators:** We need nested loops for the output generation. One loop to iterate through the number types (from 1 to 4) and an inner loop to print each number the required number of times. This requires two integer iterators.\n    *   Variables: `int i, j;`\n    *   Memory: `2 * sizeof(int) = 2 * 4 = 8` bytes.\n\n4.  **Output Formatting Flag:** A flag is needed to correctly handle the printing of the `+` symbols. It tracks whether the term to be printed is the first one.\n    *   Variable: `int is_first_term;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation:**\n\nWe sum the memory usage of all necessary variables:\n`m = (memory for counts) + (memory for ch) + (memory for loop iterators) + (memory for flag)`\n`m = 16 + 1 + 8 + 4`\n`m = 29` bytes.\n\nThis represents the total memory allocated on the stack for the variables within the `main` function for the most memory-efficient implementation.\n\n<<<29>>>"
