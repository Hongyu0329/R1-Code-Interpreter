    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve in two parts.**\nThe curve is defined by $x=\\cos t$, $y=b\\sin t$. The definition of `b` is piecewise, so we must analyze the curve for each interval of `t`.\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    In this interval, $b=1$. The parametric equations are $x=\\cos t$ and $y=\\sin t$.\n    We can recognize this as the standard parameterization of a circle. Since $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, this part of the curve follows the equation of a unit circle.\n    Let's find the range of x and y in this interval:\n    *   As `t` goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$.\n    *   As `t` goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $y = \\sin t$ goes from $\\sin(0)=0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$.\n    So, this piece of the curve is the upper semi-circle of radius 1, centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    In this interval, $b=5$. The parametric equations are $x=\\cos t$ and $y=5\\sin t$.\n    This is the parameterization of an ellipse. We can see this by writing $x^2 = \\cos^2 t$ and $(y/5)^2 = \\sin^2 t$, which gives the ellipse equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$.\n    Let's find the range of x and y in this interval:\n    *   As `t` goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ up to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$.\n    *   As `t` goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $y = 5\\sin t$ goes from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$ and back up to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$.\n    So, this piece of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5, centered at the origin.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the overall boundaries of the figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to determine the overall minimum and maximum values of the x and y coordinates. This defines the smallest rectangle (the bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Range of x:**\n    *   In the first part, x ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   In the second part, x also ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   Therefore, for the complete figure, the minimum x-value is $x_{min} = -1$ and the maximum x-value is $x_{max} = 1$.\n\n*   **Range of y:**\n    *   In the first part (upper semi-circle), y ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   In the second part (lower semi-ellipse), y ranges from -5 to 0.\n    *   Combining these, the overall minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$ and the overall maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box.**\nThe width and height of the bounding rectangle are calculated from the ranges of x and y.\n\n*   Width ($W$) = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   Height ($H$) = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest rectangle that outcircles the figure has dimensions 2 by 6.\n\n**Step 4: Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square.**\nThe problem asks for the area of the smallest *square* that outcircles the figure. A square must have equal side lengths. To contain the 2x6 bounding rectangle, the side length (`s`) of the square must be at least as large as the larger dimension of the rectangle.\n\n*   $s \\ge W = 2$\n*   $s \\ge H = 6$\n*   Therefore, the minimum side length for the enclosing square is $s = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the square.**\nThe area of a square with side length `s` is $s^2$.\n\n*   Area = $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
