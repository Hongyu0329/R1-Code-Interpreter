    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key event and date:** The question concerns the death of Blanche of Lancaster. We first need to establish when she died. Historical records confirm that Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **12 September 1368**.\n\n2.  **Identify the location of the key event:** Blanche died at Tutbury Castle, which is located in Staffordshire, **England**. The cause of her death is believed to have been the plague.\n\n3.  **Investigate Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368:** To answer the question, we need to know where Chaucer was during September 1368. We can determine this by looking at his documented life and career.\n    *   By 1367, Chaucer was a member of the royal court as a *valettus* or yeoman to King Edward III. This position was later elevated to esquire.\n    *   His duties were primarily based in England at the royal court.\n    *   Chaucer's life is reasonably well-documented through royal records of payments, appointments, and travel permissions.\n\n4.  **Review Chaucer's travel records around 1368:**\n    *   Chaucer did travel to the continent on diplomatic and military missions, but we need to check the specific dates.\n    *   His first documented major diplomatic journey to the continent was not until late 1372, when he went to Genoa and Florence in **Italy**.\n    *   While he did travel to **France** multiple times for diplomatic reasons, there is no record of him being there in 1368. The records that do exist for the period from 1367-1370 place him in England, receiving payments and being part of the royal household.\n\n5.  **Consider contextual evidence:**\n    *   Chaucer's famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, is an elegy mourning the death of Blanche of Lancaster. It was written shortly after her death, likely between 1368 and 1372.\n    *   The poem was commissioned by or written for Blanche's grieving husband, John of Gaunt, who was Chaucer's patron. This close relationship with the court and the principal figures involved in the event makes it overwhelmingly likely that Chaucer was present in England when he learned of her death and was inspired or commissioned to write the poem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** While we don't have a diary from Chaucer stating \"I was in London on September 12, 1368,\" the official records of his employment and payments, combined with the lack of any records placing him abroad, create a very strong case for his presence in England.\n*   **Nature of his Employment:** As an esquire in the King's household, his \"default\" location would be with the court in England, unless specifically sent elsewhere on a documented mission.\n*   **Logical Consistency:** It is far more logical that a court poet would be present at court (in England) to learn of the death of a major court figure and be commissioned to write an elegy, rather than being in a foreign country.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on his documented role as a member of the royal household and the absence of any records of foreign travel for that specific year, all evidence points to Geoffrey Chaucer being in **England** when Blanche of Lancaster died in September 1368.\n\n<<<C>>>"
