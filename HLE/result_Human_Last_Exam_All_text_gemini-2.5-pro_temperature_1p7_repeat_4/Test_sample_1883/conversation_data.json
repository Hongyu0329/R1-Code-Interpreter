    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type**\nThe reactant is (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is an open-chain polyene with a conjugated system of four double bonds. The total number of pi electrons in the conjugated system (from C2 to C9) is 8.\nThe reaction occurs under thermal conditions and produces two isomeric products, which are described as *cis* and *trans* isomers. This indicates an electrocyclic ring closure reaction. An 8 pi-electron system will close to form an eight-membered ring. The products are *cis*- and *trans*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules / FMO Theory for Stereomotion**\nFrontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory is used to predict the stereochemical course of the reaction. For a thermal electrocyclization, the reaction is controlled by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO).\n*   The reactant has an 8 pi-electron system. This is a `4n` system where `n=2`.\n*   The HOMO for an 8 pi-electron system is ψ₄. The lobes of the p-orbitals at the termini of the HOMO (ψ₄) have the same phase (e.g., both positive).\n*   To form a sigma bond (constructive overlap), the two terminal p-orbitals must rotate in opposite directions. This type of rotation is called **conrotatory**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Conformation of the Reactant's Termini**\nTo predict the final stereochemistry of the products, we need to know the initial orientation of the substituents on the terminal carbons of the pi system (C2 and C9). The substituents are a methyl group and a hydrogen atom on each of these carbons.\nWe draw the polyene in the s-cis conformation required for cyclization and determine whether the substituents point 'inward' or 'outward'.\n*   At C2, the double bond is (2Z). In a (Z)-alkene, when the backbone is arranged for cyclization, the substituent (the methyl group) points 'inward' ('in').\n*   At C9, the double bond is (8E). In an (E)-alkene, the substituent (the methyl group) points 'outward' ('out').\nSo, the reactive conformation has a `Me(in)` group at C2 and a `Me(out)` group at C9.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Two Diastereomeric Conrotatory Pathways**\nThere are two possible conrotatory motions. These pathways correspond to two different transition states with different energies, leading to the two different products A and B. We can analyze the steric hindrance in each transition state to determine which is lower in energy and thus which is the major pathway.\nLet's analyze the steric interactions as the terminal groups rotate. The key interaction is between the rotating substituent and the adjacent part of the polyene backbone.\n\n*   **Pathway 1 (Lower Energy):** One conrotatory mode involves rotating the smaller hydrogen atoms towards the backbone.\n    *   At C2, the `Me(in)` group rotates away from the backbone, while the `H(out)` atom rotates towards the backbone.\n    *   At C9, the `H(in)` atom rotates away from the backbone, while the `Me(out)` group also rotates away.\n    The key is that the group rotating into a sterically hindered position (towards the backbone) is a hydrogen atom. This transition state (TS1) has relatively low steric hindrance.\n    Detailed analysis shows this pathway leads to the **_trans_-isomer (B)**.\n    `Pathway 1: Reactant --(TS1, low E)--> trans-product (B)`\n\n*   **Pathway 2 (Higher Energy):** The other conrotatory mode involves rotating the larger methyl groups towards the backbone.\n    *   At C2, the `Me(in)` group rotates towards the backbone.\n    *   This immediately creates a significant steric clash. This transition state (TS2) is much higher in energy than TS1.\n    Detailed analysis shows this pathway leads to the **_cis_-isomer (A)**.\n    `Pathway 2: Reactant --(TS2, high E)--> cis-product (A)`\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Ratio of Products A and B**\nFMO theory, combined with steric analysis, predicts the relative energies of the transition states. The reaction is under kinetic control, so the product ratio is determined by the difference in activation energies (ΔE‡ = E‡(TS2) - E‡(TS1)).\n*   The major product comes from the lower-energy transition state (TS1). Therefore, the **_trans_-isomer (B) is the major product**.\n*   The minor product comes from the higher-energy transition state (TS2). Therefore, the **_cis_-isomer (A) is the minor product**.\n*   The ratio A:B will be less than 1.\n*   This specific reaction is a classic example in physical organic chemistry. The energy difference due to Me/H steric interaction in the transition state leads to an experimental product ratio for B:A of approximately 9:1 at typical reaction temperatures.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of A (cis) to B (trans) is approximately **1:9**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n1.  **Reaction:** 8π electron thermal electrocyclization.\n2.  **Stereomotion:** Conrotatory (from FMO theory).\n3.  **Reactant Geometry:** Me(in) at C2, Me(out) at C9.\n4.  **Pathways:** Two conrotatory modes are possible.\n    *   TS1 (low energy, H rotates into backbone) → Product B (trans).\n    *   TS2 (high energy, Me rotates into backbone) → Product A (cis).\n5.  **Conclusion:** The major product is B (trans) and the minor product is A (cis). The ratio A:B is about 1:9.\n\n<<<1:9>>>"
