CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to exhibit an increased release of key effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to T cells manufactured without it. This is because IL-15 promotes a less differentiated, memory-like T cell phenotype with enhanced persistence and proliferative capacity, leading to a more potent and sustained functional response.
