    "This question asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. To answer this, we will find the dimension of the corresponding Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\n**1. The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\n\nThe equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. In three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbf{x} = (x, y, z)$) and one time dimension ($t$), they are given for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = (u, v, w)$ and the pressure field $p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ as:\n\n*   **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n*   **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity.\n\n**2. Symmetries of the Equations**\n\nA symmetry of a differential equation is a transformation of the independent and dependent variables that maps solutions to other solutions. We seek the Lie group of such transformations. The dimension of this group is the number of independent infinitesimal generators that form its Lie algebra. These generators correspond to fundamental physical invariances.\n\n**3. Identifying the Symmetries and their Generators**\n\nWe list the continuous transformations that leave the NS equations unchanged.\n\n*   **Time Translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$).\n    *   Transformation: $t \\rightarrow t + s$\n    *   Number of generators: 1 (Generator: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$)\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n*   **Space Translations:** The equations are homogeneous in space.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$ (for a constant vector $\\mathbf{a}$)\n    *   Number of generators: 3 (Generators: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$)\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Space Rotations:** The equations are isotropic (invariant under rotations).\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{u}$ (for a rotation matrix $R \\in SO(3)$)\n    *   The group $SO(3)$ is 3-dimensional.\n    *   Number of generators: 3 (Generators for rotations about the x, y, z axes)\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$\n    *   Number of generators: 3 (One for each direction of the boost velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$)\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations possess a specific scaling symmetry that relates space, time, velocity, and pressure.\n    *   Transformation: $t \\rightarrow a^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow a\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow a^{-1}\\mathbf{u}$, $p \\rightarrow a^{-2}p$ (for a scaling factor $a$)\n    *   This is a one-parameter group of transformations.\n    *   Number of generators: 1\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n*   **Pressure Gauge Symmetry:** The pressure $p$ only appears through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, if $p$ is a solution, so is $p + f(t)$ where $f(t)$ is an *arbitrary* function of time.\n    *   Transformation: $p \\rightarrow p + \\epsilon f(t)$\n    *   This implies an infinite number of generators (e.g., $t^k \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ for $k=0, 1, 2, ...$ form an infinite set of independent generators).\n    *   Dimension: $\\infty$\n\n**4. Determining \"The\" Dimension**\n\nThe full Lie group of point symmetries is infinite-dimensional due to the pressure gauge symmetry. However, in this context, the question is conventionally understood to ask for the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional* part of the symmetry group (also known as the principal or essential Lie algebra). This algebra consists of the physically significant symmetries (translations, rotations, boosts, scaling) and excludes the infinite-dimensional \"gauge\" part.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Point Symmetries:** We have considered point symmetries, which transform the variables $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$ directly. We have not considered more complex generalized or non-local symmetries. For the NS equations, the point symmetry group is the most commonly studied.\n2.  **Finite vs. Infinite Dimension:** The most crucial point is recognizing that the full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional. The final numerical answer depends on whether the question refers to the full group or the conventional finite-dimensional part. Standard practice in physics and applied mathematics is to quote the dimension of the finite part.\n3.  **Role of the Viscous Term:** The presence of the viscous term $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ is what restricts the scaling symmetry to a single dimension. For the Euler equations ($\\nu=0$), the scaling group is two-dimensional, leading to a larger finite-dimensional symmetry group.\n4.  **Spatial Dimension:** The calculation is specific to $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the dimensions for space translations, rotations, and Galilean boosts would change, leading to a different result.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nWe sum the dimensions contributed by each of the finite-dimensional symmetry subgroups:\n\n1.  Time Translation: 1\n2.  Space Translations: 3\n3.  Space Rotations: 3\n4.  Galilean Boosts: 3\n5.  Scaling: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\nThis 11-dimensional algebra is the maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n<<<11>>>"
