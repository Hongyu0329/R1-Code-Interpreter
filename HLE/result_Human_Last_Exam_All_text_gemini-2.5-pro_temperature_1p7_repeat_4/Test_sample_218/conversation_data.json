    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely determined (up to isomorphism) by a partition of $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ..., \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. The problem is to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is calculated using the hook-length formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{ij}}$, where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ of the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell.\n\nThe general behavior of $d_\\lambda$ is that it is smallest for partitions that are \"long and thin,\" i.e., partitions with a very large first part $\\lambda_1$ or a very large number of parts $k$ (which means the conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ has a large first part). These partitions are the \"hooks\" and \"near-hooks\". Partitions that are more \"compact\" or \"central\" (like $\\lambda \\approx (\\sqrt{n}, \\sqrt{n}, ...)$) have much larger dimensions.\n\nLet's systematically search for partitions with small dimensions. We can organize the search by the \"defect\" $d = n - \\lambda_1$, which is the number of cells not in the first row.\n\n**Step 1: Enumerate partitions by defect $d$ and calculate their dimensions.**\n\nWe will list partitions $\\lambda$ of the form $(25-d, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of $d$. We calculate $d_\\lambda$ for each. If $d_\\lambda < 500,000$, we count it.\n\n*   **Defect d=0:** $\\lambda=(25)$. $d_{(25)}=1$. (1 partition)\n*   **Defect d=1:** $\\lambda=(24,1)$. $d_{(24,1)} = 24$. (1 partition)\n*   **Defect d=2:** The partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $d=275$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: $d=276$.\n    Both dimensions are < 500,000. (2 partitions)\n*   **Defect d=3:** The partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $d=2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $d=4025$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$: $d=2024$.\n    All 3 are < 500,000. (3 partitions)\n*   **Defect d=4:** The $p(4)=5$ partitions of 4 all lead to irreps with dimension < 500,000.\n    *   $(21,4): d=10350$. $(21,3,1): d=27132$. $(21,2,2): d=12650$. $(21,2,1,1): d=29075$. $(21,1^4): d=10626$.\n    (5 partitions)\n*   **Defect d=5:** The $p(5)=7$ partitions of 5 all lead to irreps with dimension < 500,000.\n    *   Dimensions range from 40,480 to 148,148.\n    (7 partitions)\n*   **Defect d=6:** For $\\lambda=(19,\\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash 6$. There are $p(6)=11$ such partitions.\n    *   $(19,6): d=123970$. $(19,5,1): d=425040$. $(19,4,2): d=344250$. $(19,3,3): d=300300$. $(19,3,2,1): d=480480$. $(19,2,2,2): d=231660$. $(19,2,1^4): d=468390$. $(19,1^6): d=134596$.\n    *   The remaining 3 partitions, $(19,4,1,1), (19,3,1^3), (19,2,2,1,1)$, have dimensions > 500,000.\n    (8 partitions)\n*   **Defect d=7:** For $\\lambda=(18,\\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash 7$. There are $p(7)=15$ such partitions.\n    *   $(18,7): d=303600$.\n    *   $(18,1^7): d=\\binom{24}{7}=346104$.\n    *   All other partitions of this form have dimensions well over 500,000 (e.g., $d_{(18,6,1)} \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^6$).\n    (2 partitions)\n*   **Defect d=8:** For $\\lambda=(17,\\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash 8$.\n    *   The expected smallest dimensions are for the hook-like partitions:\n    *   $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1081575 - 480700 = 600875$. This is > 500,000.\n    *   $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735471$. This is > 500,000.\n    *   Since the dimensions for other partitions of this type are even larger, no partitions with defect 8 satisfy the condition. (0 partitions)\n*   **Defect d > 8:** The dimensions will continue to grow, so no more partitions are found this way.\n\nSo far, we have found a total of $1+1+2+3+5+7+8+2 = 29$ partitions. Let's call this set $\\Lambda_L$. All partitions $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda_L$ have a large first part, specifically $\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the conjugate partitions.**\n\nFor any partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ corresponds to an irrep with the same dimension, $d_{\\lambda'} = d_\\lambda$. The Young diagram of $\\lambda'$ is the transpose of the diagram of $\\lambda$. If $\\lambda \\ne \\lambda'$, then it corresponds to a distinct irrep. A partition is self-conjugate if $\\lambda=\\lambda'$.\n\nThe 29 partitions we found all have a large first part $\\lambda_1$ and a small number of parts $k(\\lambda)$. For example, for $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$, $\\lambda_1=18$ and $k(\\lambda)=8$. A partition can only be self-conjugate if its diagram is symmetric, which implies $\\lambda_1 = k(\\lambda)$. Since $\\lambda_1 > k(\\lambda)$ for all 29 partitions, none of them are self-conjugate.\n\nTherefore, for each of the 29 partitions $\\lambda$ we found, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ is a distinct partition with the same dimension, $d_{\\lambda'} < 500,000$.\nLet's analyze the conjugates. The first part of a conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is equal to the number of parts of $\\lambda$, i.e., $\\lambda'_1 = k(\\lambda)$. For our 29 partitions, the number of parts ranges from $k=1$ (for $\\lambda=(25)$) to $k=8$ (for $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$).\nSo, all 29 conjugate partitions have their first part $\\lambda'_1 \\le 8$. This means they are all distinct from the original 29 partitions (which had $\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$).\n\nThis gives us $29 \\times 2 = 58$ distinct irreps so far.\n\n**Step 3: Ensure no other types of partitions were missed.**\n\nThe partitions we have found are characterized by having a \"defect\" of at most 7, meaning either $25-\\lambda_1 \\le 7$ or (for the conjugates) $25-k(\\lambda) \\le 7$. Could there be a partition $\\mu$ with a small dimension where both $25-\\mu_1 > 7$ and $25-k(\\mu) > 7$? This means $\\mu_1 < 18$ and $k(\\mu) < 18$. Such partitions are more \"central\", and as noted earlier, their dimensions are extremely large. For example, the self-conjugate partition $(13,1^{12})$ has dimension $\\binom{24}{12} \\approx 2.7 \\times 10^6$. The central partition $(5,5,5,5,5)$ has a dimension on the order of $10^{12}$. It is safe to conclude no other such partitions exist.\n\nThe final count is the sum of the partitions we found and their distinct conjugates.\nTotal number of partitions = $29 + 29 = 58$."
