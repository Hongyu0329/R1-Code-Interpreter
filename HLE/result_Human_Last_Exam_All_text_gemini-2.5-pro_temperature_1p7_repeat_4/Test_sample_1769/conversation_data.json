    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Origin of the Current Word \"Sister\"**\nThe modern word \"sister\" comes from the Old English word *sweostor*. However, its current form, particularly the initial 'si-' sound and the loss of the 'w', is the direct result of influence from the Old Norse word *systir*. The Vikings (Norse) invaded and settled in large parts of England (the Danelaw) from the 8th century onwards, leading to significant linguistic mixing. The two words, *sweostor* and *systir*, were so similar that the Norse form eventually blended with and reshaped the native English word into the one we use today.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Native Old English Word**\nThe original word for \"sister\" in Old English, deriving from Proto-Germanic *\\*swestēr*, was *sweostor*. There was also a common dialectal variant, particularly in the influential West Saxon dialect, which was *swuster*. This variant is crucial because it represents a natural phonetic development within English itself.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Hypothetical Evolution of the Native Word**\nTo find the modern equivalent, we must trace how *sweostor* or *swuster* would have evolved through Middle English and into Modern English following the standard rules of English sound change, ignoring the Norse influence. The path from *swuster* is generally considered the more straightforward and likely one to have become dominant.\n\n*   **Old English to Middle English:** The initial cluster *sw-* before a back vowel often simplified to *s-*. The unstressed ending *-or* or *-er* leveled to *-er*. Thus, the Old English *swuster* naturally evolved into the Middle English word **suster**. This is not just a guess; *suster* was an extremely common word throughout the Middle English period. It is used extensively by authors like Geoffrey Chaucer in \"The Canterbury Tales.\"\n\n*   **Middle English to Modern English:** The next step is to apply the sound changes that occurred between Middle English and Modern English, most notably the Great Vowel Shift. The word *suster* in Middle English was pronounced with a short 'u' sound /ʊ/, the same vowel sound as in the modern word \"put\". This specific vowel sound, when it occurred in a stressed syllable, typically changed to the /ʌ/ sound (the \"STRUT\" vowel, as in the words \"cup\", \"luck\", or \"duster\").\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Final Form**\nFollowing this natural linguistic path, the Middle English *suster* (pronounced with a /ʊ/ sound) would have become a Modern English word pronounced with an /ʌ/ sound. The spelling would most likely have remained the same.\n\nTherefore, the Modern English word would be **suster**, rhyming with words like \"cluster\" and \"duster\".\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Norse Influence was a Replacement:** This is a case where a Norse word didn't just add a new concept to English but actively competed with and replaced a core native vocabulary word.\n2.  **Attested Historical Form:** The proposed alternative, *suster*, isn't purely theoretical. It was the dominant native form for hundreds of years during the Middle English period before it was eventually superseded by *sister*.\n3.  **Sound Change Rules:** The projection relies on consistent, known sound changes, specifically the simplification of the initial *sw-* cluster and the evolution of the Middle English short 'u' vowel into the modern /ʌ/ vowel.\n4.  **Alternative Paths:** While the evolution from *swuster* to *suster* is the most likely, an evolution from the Old English *sweostor* might have resulted in a form like *soster* (rhyming with \"foster\"). However, given the prevalence of the *suster* form in the developing London dialect (thanks to writers like Chaucer), it is the far stronger candidate for what would have become the modern standard.\n\n***\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{suster}$."
