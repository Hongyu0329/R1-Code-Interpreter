    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structure of the Character:**\n    The character 謄 is a composite kanji formed by two parts arranged side-by-side in a left-right structure. This structure is known as *hen* (left side) and *tsukuri* (right side).\n    *   The left component is: 言\n    *   The right component is: 朕\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):**\n    In most kanji with a left-right structure, the component on the left (*hen*) serves as the radical for dictionary classification. The radical often gives a clue to the character's general meaning. In this case, the left part, 言, is the radical. The radical 言 relates to speech, words, and language.\n\n3.  **Determine the Name of the Radical:**\n    Radicals in Japanese have specific names, which can change depending on their position within a character.\n    *   The radical is 言.\n    *   When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is called ごんべん (*gonben*). The \"gon\" part comes from the sound reading of 言, and \"ben\" is a voiced form of \"hen\" (偏), the term for a left-side radical.\n\n4.  **Convert to Hepburn Romanization:**\n    The final step is to write the radical's name, ごんべん, using Hepburn romanization, which is the standard system for transcribing Japanese into the Latin alphabet.\n    *   ごん (go + n) -> gon\n    *   べん (be + n) -> ben\n    *   Putting them together, we get \"Gonben\".\n\nTherefore, the radical for the character 謄 is 言, and its name in Hepburn transcription is Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
