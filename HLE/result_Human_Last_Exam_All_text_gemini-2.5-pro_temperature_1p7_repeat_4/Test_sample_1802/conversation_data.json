    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define the Terms\n\n*   **Qudit:** We are considering a $d$-dimensional quantum system, or qudit, with a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$ of dimension $d$.\n*   **Pauli Channel:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel acting on the density matrix $\\rho$ of a qudit, defined as:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger $$\n    Here, $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_{a,b} \\ge 0, \\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} = 1$). The operators $U_{a,b}$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. There are $d^2$ such operators.\n*   **Complementary Channel:** Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometric interaction $V$ of the system with an environment $E$, initially in a pure state $|e_0\\rangle$. The channel is obtained by tracing out the environment. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is obtained by tracing out the system instead.\n*   **Rank of a Channel:** The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. We aim to find the *maximal* possible rank for $\\Lambda^c$, which means we can choose the probabilities $p_{a,b}$ to achieve this maximum.\n\n### Step 2: List the Careful Points\n\n1.  **Kraus Operators:** From the definition of the Pauli channel, a valid set of Kraus operators is $\\{K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}\\}$. The number of Kraus operators depends on how many $p_{a,b}$ are non-zero.\n2.  **Maximization:** To find the maximal rank, we should consider the case where the channel has the richest structure. This typically corresponds to using the largest possible set of Kraus operators, which occurs when all $d^2$ probabilities $p_{a,b}$ are strictly positive. An example of such a channel is the depolarizing channel for a certain range of its parameter.\n3.  **Relating $\\Lambda$ and $\\Lambda^c$:** The ranks of a channel and its complementary channel are related through the Stinespring dilation. A powerful method to calculate the rank of $\\Lambda^c$ is to analyze a tripartite pure state associated with the dilation and then use properties of partial traces.\n4.  **Properties of Pauli Operators:** The orthogonality property of the Pauli basis is key: $\\text{Tr}(U_{c,e}^\\dagger U_{a,b}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{a,c} \\delta_{b,e}$. This will be crucial for proving linear independence later.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\n1.  **Stinespring Dilation:** Let the system Hilbert space be $\\mathcal{H}_A \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$ and the output space be $\\mathcal{H}_B \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$. The Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ maps operators on $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to operators on $\\mathcal{H}_B$. Its Kraus operators are $K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}$. The environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ must accommodate these operators, so its dimension is at most $d^2$. Let $\\{|a,b\\rangle_E\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The Stinespring isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ is given by:\n    $$ V |\\psi\\rangle_A = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} (K_{a,b} |\\psi\\rangle_A)_B \\otimes |a,b\\rangle_E $$\n\n2.  **The Tripartite Pure State:** We can study the channel by its action on one half of a maximally entangled state $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} |k\\rangle \\otimes |k\\rangle$. Let's consider a tripartite system $A'AB$ and a pure state $|\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE}$ which is the result of the channel's isometry $V$ acting on one part of $|\\Phi^+\\rangle_{A'A}$:\n    $$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE} = (I_{A'} \\otimes V_A) |\\Phi^+\\rangle_{A'A} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} |k\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes V|k\\rangle_A $$\n    Substituting the expression for $V$:\n    $$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} |k\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes \\left( \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} (K_{a,b} |k\\rangle_B) \\otimes |a,b\\rangle_E \\right) $$\n    $$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE} = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} |k\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes K_{a,b}|k\\rangle_B \\right) \\otimes |a,b\\rangle_E $$\n\n3.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel:** The Choi matrix of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is proportional to the partial trace of the state $|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{A'BE}$ over the system $B$, i.e., $J(\\Lambda^c) \\propto \\rho_{A'E} = \\text{Tr}_B(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{A'BE})$. A fundamental result from quantum information theory is that for any pure state on a composite system (here $A'B$ and $E$), the ranks of the reduced density matrices are equal.\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda^c)) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_{A'E}) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_{A'B}) $$\n    where $\\rho_{A'B} = \\text{Tr}_E(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{A'BE})$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Rank($\\rho_{A'B}$):** Let's define the vectors $|\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle_{A'B} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} |k\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes K_{a,b}|k\\rangle_B$.\n    Then $|\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE} = \\sum_{a,b} |\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle_{A'B} \\otimes |a,b\\rangle_E$.\n    Now, we compute $\\rho_{A'B}$:\n    $$ \\rho_{A'B} = \\text{Tr}_E \\left( \\sum_{a,b,c,e} |\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle\\langle\\psi_{c,e}|_{A'B} \\otimes |a,b\\rangle\\langle c,e|_E \\right) = \\sum_{a,b} |\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle\\langle\\psi_{a,b}|_{A'B} $$\n    The rank of $\\rho_{A'B}$ is the dimension of the linear span of the vectors $\\{|\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle\\}$.\n\n5.  **Maximize the Rank:** To maximize the rank, we assume all probabilities $p_{a,b}$ are non-zero. This means we have $d^2$ vectors $|\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle$ in the sum. Their linear independence determines the rank. Let's check if they are orthogonal.\n    $$ \\langle\\psi_{c,e}|\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\left( \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} \\langle l|_{A'} \\otimes \\langle l|K_{c,e}^\\dagger \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} |k\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes K_{a,b}|k\\rangle \\right) $$\n    $$ = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l} \\delta_{lk} \\langle l| K_{c,e}^\\dagger K_{a,b} |k\\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_k \\langle k| K_{c,e}^\\dagger K_{a,b} |k\\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\text{Tr}(K_{c,e}^\\dagger K_{a,b}) $$\n    Substituting $K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}}U_{a,b}$:\n    $$ \\langle\\psi_{c,e}|\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_{c,e} p_{a,b}}}{d} \\text{Tr}(U_{c,e}^\\dagger U_{a,b}) $$\n    Using the orthogonality property $\\text{Tr}(U_{c,e}^\\dagger U_{a,b}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{a,c} \\delta_{b,e}$:\n    $$ \\langle\\psi_{c,e}|\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_{c,e} p_{a,b}}}{d} (d \\cdot \\delta_{a,c} \\delta_{b,e}) = \\sqrt{p_{c,e} p_{a,b}} \\cdot \\delta_{a,c} \\delta_{b,e} $$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The vectors $\\{|\\psi_{a,b}\\rangle\\}$ form an orthogonal set. If we choose all $p_{a,b} > 0$, then none of these vectors are the zero vector. An orthogonal set of non-zero vectors is linearly independent. Since there are $d^2$ such vectors, the dimension of their span is $d^2$.\n    Therefore, the rank of $\\rho_{A'B}$ is $d^2$. This means the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is $d^2$.\n\nThis maximum is achieved for any Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities $p_{a,b}$ are non-zero.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
