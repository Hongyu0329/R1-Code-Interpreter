    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Surface Code Encoding\n\n*   **Surface Code Patch:** A surface code is a quantum error-correcting code where physical qubits are arranged on a 2D lattice. A single, isolated rectangular piece (or \"patch\") of this code can store logical information.\n*   **Logical Qubit from Boundaries:** A standard, simple patch of surface code without any internal defects (holes) can encode **one logical qubit**. The logical operators (like logical X and logical Z) for this qubit are defined as strings of physical qubit operations that stretch between opposing boundaries of the patch.\n*   **Logical Qubit from Holes:** Creating holes (or defects) inside the surface code patch introduces new topological features. These features can be used to encode additional logical qubits. To define a new, independent logical qubit, you need a pair of non-commuting logical operators. In this context, this is typically achieved by creating a **pair of holes**.\n    *   One logical operator (e.g., a logical Z) can be represented by a loop of operators encircling one of the holes.\n    *   Its corresponding non-commuting operator (e.g., a logical X) can be represented by a string of operators connecting the two holes in the pair.\n    *   Therefore, **one pair of holes** is needed to encode **one additional logical qubit**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Components of the Question\n\n*   **\"Two patches of surface code\"**: This means we have two separate, independent surface code lattices. The total number of logical qubits will be the sum of the qubits encoded in each patch.\n*   **\"with two holes\"**: This is a description of the patches. The most natural interpretation of this phrasing is that *each* of the two patches has two holes. The question asks for the maximum number of qubits, and this interpretation yields a higher number than if the two holes were distributed between the two patches (e.g., one hole in each, which would not add any extra logical qubits).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Logical Qubits per Patch\n\nLet's calculate the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single patch with two holes.\n\n1.  **Qubits from the patch itself (boundaries):** Every single patch, by default, encodes **1** logical qubit.\n2.  **Qubits from the holes:** The patch has \"two holes\". These two holes form a single pair. As established in Step 1, one pair of holes can encode **1** additional logical qubit.\n3.  **Total per patch:** The total number of logical qubits in one patch with two holes is the sum of these contributions: 1 (from boundaries) + 1 (from the pair of holes) = **2 logical qubits**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits\n\nWe have two identical patches, and we are calculating the total number of logical qubits they can encode.\n\n*   **Patch 1:** Has two holes, so it encodes **2** logical qubits.\n*   **Patch 2:** Also has two holes, so it encodes **2** logical qubits.\n*   **Total:** Since the patches are separate systems, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits in each patch.\n    Total = 2 (from Patch 1) + 2 (from Patch 2) = **4** logical qubits.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBy analyzing the encoding capacity of each of the two patches with two holes and summing their contributions, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<4>>>"
