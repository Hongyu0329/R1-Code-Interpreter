Yes, changing the linker to incorporate a longer polyethylene glycol (PEG) group is a very effective and standard strategy that would likely solve the solubility problem. The poor solubility arises from the large hydrophobic thioxanthone core and the hexyl chain. A longer PEG chain would significantly increase the overall hydrophilicity of the molecule and, through steric hindrance, prevent the aggregation and π-π stacking that leads to precipitation.
