    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the specific U.S. city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Entities:**\n    *   **Film:** *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg)\n    *   **Year:** 1997\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n    *   **Action:** Moves to the United States.\n\n3.  **Establish the Character's Role:** In the film, Tommaso is the wealthy, charismatic, and worldly best friend of the protagonist, Piero Mansani. His life path serves as a contrast to Piero's, who remains in their provincial hometown of Livorno.\n\n4.  **Research the Plot Detail:** To find the specific city, one must look at the plot summary of the film. Tommaso's departure from Livorno is a significant event. After finishing school, his life of travel and adventure begins, and he eventually settles abroad.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Location:** Film synopses and detailed plot analyses of *Ovosodo* confirm that Tommaso's character, seeking a more cosmopolitan life than what Livorno can offer, moves to the United States. The city he chooses to live in is explicitly mentioned in the film's narrative as **New York**. This move symbolizes the diverging paths of the two friends—Piero's static life versus Tommaso's dynamic one.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Character Distinction:** It's important not to confuse the character in question, Tommaso (played by Marco Cocci), with the protagonist, Piero (played by Edoardo Gabbriellini). The question is specifically about Tommaso.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The information should be verified from reliable sources such as detailed plot summaries from film databases (like IMDb), film encyclopedias, or academic/critical analyses of the movie, rather than casual mentions.\n*   **Specificity:** The question asks for the city, not just the country (United States). The answer must be the specific city name.\n\nBy following these steps, the definitive answer is determined.\n\n<<<New York>>>"
