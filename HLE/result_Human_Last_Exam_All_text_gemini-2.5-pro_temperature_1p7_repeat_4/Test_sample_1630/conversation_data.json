    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the problem**\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\nLet $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, with $a \\neq 0$.\nLet $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, with $p \\neq 0$.\n\nWe are given the conditions that their derivatives are always positive:\n1.  $f'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$.\n2.  $g'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$, which is equivalent to solving the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the conditions on the derivatives**\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. This is a quadratic polynomial. For it to be positive for all $x$, it must be a parabola that opens upwards and never touches or crosses the x-axis. This imposes two conditions:\n*   The leading coefficient must be positive: $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$.\n*   The discriminant must be negative: $\\Delta_f = (2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) = 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 - 3ac < 0$.\n\nSimilarly, for $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$ to be positive for all $x$:\n*   The leading coefficient must be positive: $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$.\n*   The discriminant must be negative: $\\Delta_g = (2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) = 4q^2 - 12pr < 0 \\implies q^2 - 3pr < 0$.\n\nThese conditions imply that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all real $x$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the degree of the equation for fixed points**\nThe fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\nLet's define a new function $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The number of fixed points is the number of real roots of the equation $H(x) = 0$.\n\nLet's find the degree of the polynomial $H(x)$.\n*   The degree of $g(x)$ is 3.\n*   The degree of $f(x)$ is 3.\n*   The degree of the composite function $f(g(x))$ is the product of their degrees: $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3x^9$. Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, $ap^3 \\neq 0$.\n*   The degree of $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is therefore 9.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Thus, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**Step 4: Verify if 9 fixed points are achievable (Rolle's Theorem)**\nTo check if it's possible for $H(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, we can use Rolle's Theorem. If a differentiable function has $n$ distinct real roots, its derivative must have at least $n-1$ distinct real roots.\n\nSo, for $H(x)$ to have 9 real roots, its derivative, $H'(x)$, must have at least 8 real roots.\n\nLet's find the derivative $H'(x)$:\n$H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n\nNow, let's determine the degree of $H'(x)$.\n*   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   The degree of the composite part $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   The degree of the product $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is the sum of the degrees: $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nSo, $H'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\nThis means our requirement from Rolle's theorem (that $H'(x)$ has 8 roots) is potentially achievable.\n\n**Step 5: Plausibility of achieving the maximum number of roots**\nFor $H(x)$ to have 9 real roots, we need to show that it is possible to choose polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $H'(x)=0$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n\nThe equation $H'(x)=0$ is equivalent to $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$. Let $K(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n$K(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. For the equation $K(x)=1$ to have 8 roots, the graph of $y=K(x)$ must intersect the line $y=1$ eight times.\n\n*   **Behavior at infinity:** As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, $g(x) \\to \\pm\\infty$ (since $p>0$). Since $f'(y) \\to \\infty$ as $y \\to \\pm\\infty$ and $g'(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, their product $K(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n*   **Local Extrema:** For $K(x)$ to intersect $y=1$ eight times, it needs to have multiple local minima and maxima. The number of local extrema of $K(x)$ is determined by the number of roots of its derivative, $K'(x)$. $K(x)$ is a degree 8 polynomial, so its derivative $K'(x)$ is a degree 7 polynomial. A degree 7 polynomial can have up to 7 distinct real roots.\n*   If we can choose $f$ and $g$ such that $K'(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots, then $K(x)$ will have 7 local extrema. Since $K(x) \\to \\infty$ at both ends, it will have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima.\n*   **Feasibility:** The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ define open sets for the coefficients of the polynomials. This provides enough freedom to choose the coefficients such that:\n    1.  The 4 local minima of $K(x)$ all lie below 1.\n    2.  The 3 local maxima of $K(x)$ all lie above 1.\n    This configuration ensures that $K(x)=1$ has 8 distinct real roots, which means $H'(x)=0$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n*   If $H'(x)$ has 8 distinct real roots, $H(x)$ has 8 local extrema. Since $H(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$ and $H(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$, we can adjust the constant term of $f(x)$ (which shifts $H(x)$ vertically without changing $H'(x)$) to ensure that the local maxima are positive and the local minima are negative. This configuration guarantees that $H(x)$ crosses the x-axis 9 times.\n\nConclusion: It is possible to construct polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x))$ has 9 fixed points.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The number of fixed points is the number of roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n2.  The degree of the polynomial $f(g(x)) - x$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n3.  A degree 9 polynomial can have at most 9 real roots.\n4.  By analyzing the derivative and applying Rolle's theorem, it can be shown that it is plausible to construct such polynomials that achieve this maximum. The constraints $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ do not reduce this maximum number.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n>>>9"
