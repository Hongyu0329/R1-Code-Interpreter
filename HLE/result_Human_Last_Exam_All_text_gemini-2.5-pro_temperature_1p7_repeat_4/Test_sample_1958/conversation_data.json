    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core requirements of the question.**\nThe question has two key constraints:\n1.  The biblical book must be the \"first... in canonical order.\" This means we must start our search with Genesis and proceed book by book through the standard Protestant canon of the Bible, which Shakespeare would have known.\n2.  The book must be \"mentioned by name.\" This means the play's text must contain the actual title of the book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Psalms,\" \"Romans\"). Allusions to stories or characters from a book (like mentioning Adam and Eve, or calling someone \"as patient as Job\") do not count unless the book's title itself is used.\n\n**Step 2: Systematically search the Old Testament books in canonical order.**\nWe will go through the books one by one and search for their names in the complete works of Shakespeare.\n\n*   **Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus:** A search of Shakespeare's texts reveals no mention of these books by name.\n*   **Numbers:** This is a tricky word. The word \"numbers\" appears many times in Shakespeare, but in every case, it refers either to poetic meter (\"the numbers that Petrarch flowed in\" - *Love's Labour's Lost*) or to arithmetic and grammar (as in the Latin lesson in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*). There is no instance where it clearly refers to the biblical Book of Numbers.\n*   **Deuteronomy through Ruth:** No mentions of these books by name are found.\n*   **1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther:** None of these books are mentioned by name. The word \"kings\" is, of course, very common, but it is never used to refer to the biblical book.\n*   **Job:** The character Job is mentioned several times as a figure of patience (e.g., in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* and *2 Henry IV*), but the *Book of Job* is never explicitly named.\n*   **Psalms:** This is the 19th book of the Old Testament. A search for \"psalm\" or \"psalms\" yields a very specific result.\n\n**Careful Point:** We have found a potential candidate. Now we must analyze the specific reference to ensure it meets the criteria.\n\nIn *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act II, Scene 1), Mistress Ford receives a love letter from the scoundrel Falstaff. She is amazed at the discrepancy between his high-flown words and his actual character, saying:\n\n> \"...they do no more adhere and keep pace together than **the Hundredth Psalm** to the tune of 'Green Sleeves'.\"\n\nThis is a direct and unmistakable reference to a specific part of the **Book of Psalms**, thus naming the book. The joke lies in contrasting the solemnity of a psalm with the popular, secular, and somewhat bawdy ballad tune \"Greensleeves.\"\n\nSince we are proceeding in canonical order and have found a positive match with Psalms (the 19th book), and we have confirmed that the first 18 books are not mentioned by name, our search is complete. We do not need to continue through the rest of the Old Testament or the New Testament.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the absence of other strong contenders.**\nFor the sake of thoroughness, it is worth noting why other commonly cited possibilities are incorrect.\n\n*   **Romans, Corinthians, Galatians:** These New Testament book titles do appear as words in Shakespeare. However, their context shows they are not references to the biblical epistles.\n    *   \"Corinthian\" was Elizabethan slang for a wealthy playboy or reveler (*1 Henry IV*).\n    *   \"Galatian\" was slang for a blusterer or roisterer (*The Taming of the Shrew*), likely derived from St. Paul's criticism of the \"foolish Galatians,\" but used to describe a person, not the book.\n    *   \"Romans\" always refers to citizens of Rome.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the final answer.**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in canonical order is Psalms. The specific play where this mention occurs is *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n\n***\n\nThe first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name is **Psalms**. It is mentioned in the play **The Merry Wives of Windsor**."
