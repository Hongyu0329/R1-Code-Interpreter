    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Elements of the Question**\n*   **Book:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Protagonist/Main Character:** We need to identify who this is.\n*   **Action:** Marriage.\n*   **Target:** The name of the character the protagonist marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Main Character**\nThe main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who has been cryogenically frozen and is revived in the far future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Main Character's Relationships**\nThroughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski's primary guide, instructor, and companion in the complex post-human world is a powerful entity. This entity interacts with him and is the central figure in his personal and emotional development within the story's universe.\n\n**Step 4: Focus on the Concept of \"Marriage\" in the Novel's Context**\nJacek Dukaj's novels often deal with transhumanist and post-human concepts where traditional human institutions like marriage take on new, more complex forms. In \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" a literal, traditional wedding ceremony does not occur. Instead, the \"marriage\" refers to a deep, permanent, and transformative union or bonding between the protagonist and another character.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Character Who Forms This Union with the Protagonist**\nThe character with whom Adam Zamoyski forms this profound and binding union is his guide, a powerful post-human being. This union is a pivotal event in the plot, fundamentally changing Adam's existence and integrating him more deeply into the future civilization. Her name is Angelina.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The term \"marries\" must be interpreted within the sci-fi context of the book. It's not a conventional marriage but a form of metaphysical and technological bonding.\n*   Angelina is herself a complex being, an interface for a larger consciousness (an Inkluzja), but \"Angelina\" is the name and persona she uses in her interactions with Adam and the name by which she is known.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the plot and character relationships, the main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a life-altering union, equivalent to a marriage in the story's context, with the character named Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
