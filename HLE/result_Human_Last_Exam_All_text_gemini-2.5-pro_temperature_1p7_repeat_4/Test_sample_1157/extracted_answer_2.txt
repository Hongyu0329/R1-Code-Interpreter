The appropriate management for this patient requires a multi-phase approach prioritizing her systemic health.

*   **Medical:** Immediate referral to a physician to manage her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) with medication and lifestyle changes. No definitive dental work should be done until her glycemic control improves (target HbA1c < 7.0%).
*   **Dental:** Perform emergency wound care for the avulsed tooth sites (#22, #23, #24). This includes gentle debridement and irrigation of the sockets, suturing for soft tissue closure, and prescribing systemic antibiotics and analgesics to prevent infection and manage pain, especially given the 28-hour delay. Radiographs are essential to rule out alveolar fractures.

**Step 2: Interim Management**
*   Once the initial healing has begun (1-2 weeks), fabricate an **interim removable partial denture ("flipper")**. This is a temporary acrylic prosthesis to restore aesthetics and maintain the space while the sockets heal completely (3-6 months) and her medical condition stabilizes.

**Step 3: Definitive Management**
*   After 3-6 months and with medical clearance, a definitive restoration can b
