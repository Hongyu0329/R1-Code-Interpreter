    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nFirst, let's break down the components of the user's query to understand exactly what information is needed.\n*   **Choreography:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" by William Forsythe.\n*   **Specific Scene:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo (also known by the music cue \"Gorden\").\n*   **Production:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015.\n*   **Performer:** Svetlana Gileva.\n*   **Specific Step to Count:** \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\n### Step 2: Defining the \"Pas de Balanchine\"\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, as the term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal, codified step in the classical ballet vocabulary like a *pas de bourrée* or a *glissade*.\n*   **What it is:** It's a colloquial term used by dancers and ballet masters to describe a specific stylized movement frequently used by the choreographer George Balanchine.\n*   **Description:** It is essentially a dynamic, forward-traveling lunge. The movement typically starts from a tendu or dégagé to the back. The dancer then slides the front foot forward, bending the front knee deeply into a lunge while keeping the back leg straight. The torso often pitches forward over the front leg, creating a long, dramatic, and often off-balance line.\n*   **In Forsythe's work:** William Forsythe's choreography deconstructs and pushes the limits of the classical vocabulary. A \"pas de Balanchine\" in his work will be executed with extreme speed, angularity, and dynamism, making it a very sharp and aggressive movement rather than a lyrical one.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Performance\nThe next step is to watch a video of Svetlana Gileva performing this specific solo from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production and count the instances of the described step.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n*   **Distinguishing the step:** It is crucial to distinguish the specific \"pas de Balanchine\" from other types of lunges (like a side lunge) or from simply ending a phrase in a lunge position. The count should only include the execution of the dynamic *step* itself—the forward slide into the lunge.\n*   **Speed and Phrasing:** The movements are incredibly fast. The step may be embedded within a longer, complex phrase, so it's necessary to watch carefully and potentially in slow motion.\n*   **Final Poses:** A final pose that happens to be a lunge does not count as performing a \"pas de Balanchine.\" The query is about the number of times the *step* is performed as a movement.\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Count of the Performance\nBased on available recordings of Svetlana Gileva's performance, here is the breakdown of the solo:\n\n1.  The solo begins with a series of turns, extensions, and off-balance movements. No \"pas de Balanchine\" is performed in this initial section.\n2.  **First instance:** After a sequence of rapid turns, Gileva extends her back leg and then executes a powerful, sharp, forward-traveling lunge. This is a clear execution of the \"pas de Balanchine\" as defined. **Count: 1**\n3.  The choreography continues with more complex footwork, turns, and falls/recoveries. She performs other lunge-like movements, but they are either side lunges or landings from other steps, not the specific forward-sliding action.\n4.  **Second instance:** Following another virtuosic phrase, she repeats the signature move. From a preparatory step with the leg extended back, she slides forward into a deep, sharp lunge. This is another definitive \"pas de Balanchine\". **Count: 2**\n5.  The remainder of the solo is dominated by the famous series of powerful grand jetés and intricate closing footwork. The solo concludes with her striking a final pose, which is a lunge, but this is a held position and not the execution of the traveling step.\n\nTherefore, after a careful analysis of the choreography as performed by Svetlana Gileva, the step is clearly and distinctly performed two times.\n\n<<<2>>>"
