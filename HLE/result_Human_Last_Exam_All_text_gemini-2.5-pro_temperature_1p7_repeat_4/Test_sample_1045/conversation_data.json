    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\nThe molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   There are **7 Carbon (C) atoms**.\n*   There are **8 Hydrogen (H) atoms**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Basis Set (6-31G)\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. We need to understand what this notation means for each type of atom in the molecule. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are themselves linear combinations of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n\nA basis function is created for each atomic orbital. The question asks for the total number of these basis functions (the CGFs).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of CGFs for each Hydrogen Atom\n*   Hydrogen (H) has one electron in the 1s orbital. It has no core electrons.\n*   For hydrogen, the \"6-\" part of the basis set name is not applicable. We only consider the valence part, \"31G\".\n*   **\"31G\"** means the 1s valence orbital is \"split\" into two basis functions:\n    1.  An inner part, represented by one CGF that is a combination of **3** PGFs.\n    2.  An outer part, represented by one CGF that is a combination of **1** PGF.\n*   Therefore, each Hydrogen atom uses **1 + 1 = 2** contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of CGFs for each Carbon Atom\n*   Carbon (C) is a second-row element with core electrons (1s) and valence electrons (2s, 2p).\n*   **\"6-\"**: This describes the core 1s orbital. It is represented by a single CGF, which is a combination of **6** PGFs. So, this accounts for **1 CGF**.\n*   **\"31G\"**: This describes the valence orbitals (2s and 2p). The valence shell is \"split\" into two sets of basis functions.\n    *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** One set of basis functions, each contracted from **3** PGFs. This set includes one s-type function (for the 2s orbital) and a set of p-type functions (for the 2p orbitals: 2px, 2py, 2pz). This gives **1 s-function + 3 p-functions = 4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** A second set of basis functions, each made from **1** PGF (i.e., they are uncontracted). This also includes one s-type function and a set of p-type functions. This gives another **1 s-function + 3 p-functions = 4 CGFs**.\n*   Total for one Carbon atom = (Core functions) + (Inner Valence functions) + (Outer Valence functions) = 1 + 4 + 4 = **9** contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of CGFs for Toluene (C7H8)\nNow, we combine the results for all atoms in the molecule.\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:** 7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/C atom = **63 CGFs**\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:** 8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/H atom = **16 CGFs**\n*   **Total:** 63 CGFs + 16 CGFs = **79 CGFs**\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Identify the right quantity:** The question specifically asks for **contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs)**, also known as basis functions, not the primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs) they are built from.\n2.  **Atom types:** The interpretation of the basis set is different for hydrogen (a first-row element) and carbon (a second-row element). Hydrogen has no core orbitals, so the \"6-\" part does not apply to it.\n3.  **Split Valence:** The \"31\" in 6-31G means the valence shell is described by two functions of each orbital type (s, p). This doubling applies to both the s and p orbitals of the valence shell for carbon.\n4.  **p-orbitals:** Remember that for second-row elements, a \"p\" designation in a basis set always implies a set of three functions (px, py, pz).\n\nThe final answer is the total number of contracted Gaussian functions used in the calculation.\n\n<<<79>>>"
