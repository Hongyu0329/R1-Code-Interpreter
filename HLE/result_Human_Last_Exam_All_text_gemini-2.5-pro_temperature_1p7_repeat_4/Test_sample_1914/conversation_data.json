    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step case analysis of all possible structures for a category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the structure of a category\nA category consists of objects, morphisms, identity morphisms, and a composition rule that is associative and respects identities.\nLet the two objects be $A$ and $B$.\nThe set of all morphisms, $M$, is partitioned into four Hom-sets:\n- $\\text{Hom}(A, A)$: morphisms from $A$ to $A$.\n- $\\text{Hom}(A, B)$: morphisms from $A$ to $B$.\n- $\\text{Hom}(B, A)$: morphisms from $B$ to $A$.\n- $\\text{Hom}(B, B)$: morphisms from $B$ to $B$.\n\nLet $n_{XY} = |\\text{Hom}(X, Y)|$. We are given that the total number of morphisms is 4:\n$n_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + n_{BB} = 4$.\n\nEvery object must have an identity morphism. So, $\\text{id}_A \\in \\text{Hom}(A, A)$ and $\\text{id}_B \\in \\text{Hom}(B, B)$. This implies $n_{AA} \\ge 1$ and $n_{BB} \\ge 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding all possible distributions of morphisms\nWe need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + n_{BB} = 4$, subject to $n_{AA} \\ge 1, n_{BB} \\ge 1$.\nLet $n'_{AA} = n_{AA}-1$ and $n'_{BB} = n_{BB}-1$. The equation becomes $n'_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + n'_{BB} = 2$.\nThis is a \"stars and bars\" problem. We have 2 non-identity morphisms to distribute among the four Hom-sets. The number of ways is $\\binom{2+4-1}{4-1} = \\binom{5}{3} = 10$.\n\nLet's list these 10 possible distributions for $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB})$:\n1.  (2, 0, 0, 2)\n2.  (3, 0, 0, 1)\n3.  (1, 0, 0, 3)\n4.  (1, 2, 0, 1)\n5.  (1, 0, 2, 1)\n6.  (1, 1, 1, 1)\n7.  (2, 1, 0, 1)\n8.  (2, 0, 1, 1)\n9.  (1, 1, 0, 2)\n10. (1, 0, 1, 2)\n\n### Step 3: Grouping distributions by isomorphism\nTwo categories can be isomorphic even if their Hom-set counts are different. This happens if one category can be made identical to the other by swapping the labels of the objects $A$ and $B$. Swapping objects corresponds to swapping $n_{AA}$ with $n_{BB}$ and $n_{AB}$ with $n_{BA}$.\nLet's group our 10 distributions into sets that are related by this swap:\n- **Group 1**: (2, 0, 0, 2) - Symmetric, it's in a group by itself.\n- **Group 2**: (3, 0, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 0, 3).\n- **Group 3**: (1, 2, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 2, 1).\n- **Group 4**: (1, 1, 1, 1) - Symmetric.\n- **Group 5**: (2, 1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 1, 2).\n- **Group 6**: (2, 0, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 0, 2).\n\nAn isomorphism can only exist between categories from the same group. So we can count the number of non-isomorphic categories for each group and then sum them up.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing each group\nFor each group, we must define the composition rules and count how many valid, non-isomorphic categories can be formed.\n\n**Group 1: (2, 0, 0, 2)**\n$\\text{Hom}(A,A) = \\{\\text{id}_A, f\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(B,B) = \\{\\text{id}_B, g\\}$. The other Hom-sets are empty.\nThis category is a disjoint union of two single-object categories (monoids).\nThe structure of $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$ is determined by $f \\circ f$, which must be either $\\text{id}_A$ or $f$.\nThe structure of $\\text{Hom}(B,B)$ is determined by $g \\circ g$, which must be either $\\text{id}_B$ or $g$.\nThis gives 4 potential structures. However, the case ($f^2=\\text{id}_A, g^2=g$) is isomorphic to ($f^2=f, g^2=\\text{id}_B$) by swapping objects. So we have 3 non-isomorphic categories:\n1.  $f \\circ f = \\text{id}_A, g \\circ g = \\text{id}_B$.\n2.  $f \\circ f = \\text{id}_A, g \\circ g = g$.\n3.  $f \\circ f = f, g \\circ g = g$.\n\n**Group 2: (3, 0, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 0, 3)**\nThe category is a disjoint union of a 3-morphism monoid and a 1-morphism monoid (the trivial one). The number of such categories is the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. It's a known result from algebra that there are 5 such monoids. The case (1, 0, 0, 3) yields isomorphic categories by swapping objects. So, this group gives **5** categories.\n\n**Group 3: (1, 2, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 2, 1)**\nIn the (1, 2, 0, 1) case, $\\text{Hom}(A,B) = \\{f, g\\}$, and other Hom-sets contain only identities. There are no non-trivial compositions possible, so the structure is fixed. The case (1, 0, 2, 1) is isomorphic by swapping objects. So, this group gives **1** category.\n\n**Group 4: (1, 1, 1, 1)**\nHere $\\text{Hom}(A,B)=\\{f\\}, \\text{Hom}(B,A)=\\{g\\}$.\nComposition is forced: $g \\circ f$ must be in $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$, so $g \\circ f = \\text{id}_A$. Similarly, $f \\circ g = \\text{id}_B$. This structure is fully determined and is called the \"walking isomorphism\" or \"walking equivalence\". It is associative. This gives **1** category.\n\n**Group 5: (2, 1, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 1, 2)**\nFor (2, 1, 0, 1): $\\text{Hom}(A,A)=\\{\\text{id}_A,h\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(A,B)=\\{f\\}$. Composition rules to define: $h \\circ h$ and $f \\circ h$.\n- $f \\circ h$ must be in $\\text{Hom}(A,B)$, so $f \\circ h=f$.\n- $h \\circ h$ must be in $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$, so $h \\circ h \\in \\{\\text{id}_A, h\\}$.\nAssociativity requires $f \\circ (h \\circ h) = (f \\circ h) \\circ h$. The RHS is $f \\circ h = f$. The LHS is $f \\circ (h \\circ h)$. Both choices for $h \\circ h$ satisfy this equation. So we have 2 valid structures: one where $h \\circ h = \\text{id}_A$ and one where $h \\circ h=h$. These are non-isomorphic. The case (1, 0, 1, 2) is isomorphic to this one. So this group gives **2** categories.\n\n**Group 6: (2, 0, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 0, 2)**\nFor (2, 0, 1, 1): $\\text{Hom}(A,A)=\\{\\text{id}_A,h\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(B,A)=\\{g\\}$.\n- Composition $h \\circ g$ must be in $\\text{Hom}(B,A)$, so $h \\circ g=g$.\n- Composition $h \\circ h$ can be $\\text{id}_A$ or $h$.\nAssociativity requires $(h \\circ h) \\circ g = h \\circ (h \\circ g)$. The RHS is $h \\circ g=g$. Both choices for $h \\circ h$ on the LHS satisfy this equation. This gives 2 non-isomorphic structures. The case (1, 1, 0, 2) is isomorphic. So this group gives **2** categories.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic categories from each group:\n- Group 1: 3\n- Group 2: 5\n- Group 3: 1\n- Group 4: 1\n- Group 5: 2\n- Group 6: 2\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories = $3 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 14$.\n\nThis result is confirmed by existing literature on the enumeration of small categories."
