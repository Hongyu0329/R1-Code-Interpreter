    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix A.\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Analyze the Contextual Information:** The question mentions \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n    *   **Matrix A:** This matrix is symmetric and its diagonal entries are all 2. It is a well-known matrix in mathematics, specifically it is the Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra of type \\(\\tilde{A}_2\\).\n    *   **Markov Quiver:** This is a concept from the theory of cluster algebras, related to the Markov equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). The integer solutions to this equation are Markov triples. The number 13 is a Markov number, as it appears in the triple (1, 5, 13).\n    *   **Careful Point:** While the context is interesting and points to a specific area of advanced mathematics, the matrix A is explicitly provided. Therefore, the problem reduces to a direct computation of its determinant. The contextual information serves to identify the origin of the matrix but is not needed for the calculation itself.\n\n3.  **Choose a Method for Calculating the Determinant:** For a 3x3 matrix, we can use the standard cofactor expansion or the Rule of Sarrus. An even quicker method, if applicable, is to check for linear dependence among rows or columns.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Cofactor Expansion**\n        The determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix}\\) is \\(a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\\).\n        Let's apply this to matrix A:\n        *   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n        *   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n        *   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\n        det(A) = 2 * ( (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) - (-1) * ( (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) + (-1) * ( (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) )\n        det(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 - (-2))\n        det(A) = 2 * (3) + 1 * (-3) - 1 * (1 + 2)\n        det(A) = 6 - 3 - 1 * (3)\n        det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\n        det(A) = 0\n\n    *   **Method 2: Linear Dependence (Insightful Check)**\n        A matrix has a determinant of 0 if and only if its rows or columns are linearly dependent. Let's examine the rows (R1, R2, R3) and columns (C1, C2, C3).\n        *   R1 = [2, -1, -1]\n        *   R2 = [-1, 2, -1]\n        *   R3 = [-1, -1, 2]\n\n        Let's try adding the rows together:\n        R1 + R2 + R3 = [ (2) + (-1) + (-1), (-1) + (2) + (-1), (-1) + (-1) + (2) ]\n        R1 + R2 + R3 = [ 0, 0, 0 ]\n\n        Since the sum of the three row vectors is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent.\n        **Careful Point:** A key property of determinants is that if the rows (or columns) of a matrix are linearly dependent, the determinant is zero. This provides a very quick and certain way to find the answer. The same logic applies to columns: C1 + C2 + C3 = [0, 0, 0]^T.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Both methods of calculation lead to the same result. The property that the sum of the rows/columns is zero is characteristic of the Cartan matrix for an affine Lie algebra \\(\\tilde{A}_{n-1}\\) in general, confirming that the determinant must be 0. The context provided is consistent with this result.\n\nThe determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
