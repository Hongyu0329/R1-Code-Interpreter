    "### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concept: Cap Sets**\n\n*   A **cap set** is a subset of points in a finite vector space, specifically $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$, such that no three distinct points lie on a line.\n*   An equivalent definition is that a set $A \\subseteq (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ is a cap set if for any three distinct vectors $x, y, z \\in A$, we have $x + y + z \\neq 0$. (This is equivalent because three distinct points $x, y, z$ form an arithmetic progression if and only if $x+z = 2y$, which in $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ is $x+z = -y$, or $x+y+z=0$).\n*   The size of the largest possible cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ is denoted by $r_3(n)$.\n*   The question asks for the **best known lower bound** for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, which is $r_3(8)$. A lower bound is a value $L$ for which we can prove that a cap set of size at least $L$ exists, usually by providing an explicit construction.\n\n**2. Basic Lower Bound Constructions**\n\n*   A simple and well-known construction is to take the set of all vectors whose coordinates are only 0 or 1. This set is $S = \\{0,1\\}^n \\subset (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$.\n*   This set $S$ is a cap set. To see why, let $x, y, z$ be three distinct vectors in $S$ such that $x+y+z=0 \\pmod 3$. For each coordinate $i$, we must have $x_i+y_i+z_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. Since each coordinate can only be 0 or 1, the sum $x_i+y_i+z_i$ can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. To be divisible by 3, the sum must be 0 or 3.\n    *   If $x_i+y_i+z_i = 0$, then $x_i=y_i=z_i=0$.\n    *   If $x_i+y_i+z_i = 3$, then $x_i=y_i=z_i=1$.\n*   For the equation $x+y+z=0$ to hold, every coordinate must satisfy one of these two conditions. This implies that $x=y=z$. However, the definition requires the three points to be distinct. Therefore, no three distinct points in $S$ sum to zero.\n*   The size of this cap set is $|S| = 2^n$.\n*   For dimension $n=8$, this gives a lower bound of $r_3(8) \\ge 2^8 = 256$.\n*   Looking at the answer choices, we can immediately rule out A (224), B (16), D (80), and E (45) because 256 is a valid, well-known lower bound, and the *best known* one must be at least this large. The answer must be C (512) or F (496).\n\n**3. Advanced Lower Bound Constructions (Product Rule)**\n\n*   Better lower bounds can often be found by combining known cap sets in lower dimensions. The most common method is the **product construction**.\n*   If $A$ is a cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^m$ and $B$ is a cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$, then their Cartesian product $A \\times B$ is a cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{m+n}$.\n*   The size of this new cap set is $|A \\times B| = |A| \\cdot |B|$. This gives us the rule: $r_3(m+n) \\ge r_3(m) \\cdot r_3(n)$.\n*   To find the best lower bound for $r_3(8)$, we should test different ways to write 8 as a sum of smaller integers and use the best-known bounds for those smaller dimensions.\n\n**4. Known Values and Bounds for $r_3(n)$ in Small Dimensions**\n\nWe need the record values for $r_3(n)$ where $n < 8$. These are results from mathematical research, some of which required extensive computer searches.\n*   $r_3(1) = 2$ (exact)\n*   $r_3(2) = 4$ (exact)\n*   $r_3(3) = 9$ (exact)\n*   $r_3(4) = 20$ (exact)\n*   $r_3(5) = 45$ (exact)\n*   $r_3(6) \\ge 112$ (This is a constructed bound by Edel, which is better than any simple product like $r_3(3)\\cdot r_3(3)=81$ or $r_3(2)\\cdot r_3(4)=80$).\n*   $r_3(7) \\ge 248$ (This bound comes from a construction by Ytrehus using methods from coding theory).\n\n**5. Applying the Product Rule for n=8**\n\nLet's apply the product rule with the best values above:\n*   $8 = 4 + 4$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(4) \\cdot r_3(4) = 20 \\cdot 20 = 400$.\n*   $8 = 3 + 5$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(3) \\cdot r_3(5) = 9 \\cdot 45 = 405$.\n*   $8 = 2 + 6$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(2) \\cdot r_3(6) \\ge 4 \\cdot 112 = 448$.\n*   $8 = 1 + 7$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(1) \\cdot r_3(7) \\ge 2 \\cdot 248 = 496$.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   By systematically applying the product rule with the best known lower bounds for smaller dimensions, we get several lower bounds for $r_3(8)$. The best one among them is 496.\n*   This is the current best-known lower bound in the mathematical literature.\n*   Comparing our result with the remaining answer choices:\n    *   C. 512\n    *   F. 496\n*   Our calculation yields 496. While 512 is a \"nicer\" number (a power of 2), there is no known construction that achieves this size for a cap set in dimension 8. Therefore, 496 is the correct answer based on current published research.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The calculation $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(1) \\cdot r_3(7) \\ge 2 \\cdot 248 = 496$ is correct. The values for $r_3(1)$ and the bound for $r_3(7)$ are standard in the field. This gives the best lower bound among the options.\n\n<<<F>>>"
