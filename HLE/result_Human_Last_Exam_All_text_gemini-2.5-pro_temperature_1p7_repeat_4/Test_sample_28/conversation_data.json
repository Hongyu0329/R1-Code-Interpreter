    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the given hypothesis class.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Domain (X):** A set of points on which the classifiers are defined. Its size is $|X|=T$.\n*   **Hypothesis Class ($H_{z-ones}$):** This is a set of functions (classifiers) $h: X \\to \\{0,1\\}$. The defining characteristic of this class is that for any function $h$ in this class, the number of points $x \\in X$ for which $h(x)=1$ is exactly $z$.\n    *   $H_{z-ones} = \\{h: X \\to \\{0,1\\} \\mid |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}| = z\\}$.\n*   **VC Dimension:** The VC dimension of a hypothesis class $H$ is the size of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be **shattered** by $H$.\n*   **Shattering:** A set of points $S$ is shattered by $H$ if for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there exists a hypothesis $h \\in H$ that produces that exact labeling. If $|S|=k$, this means we must be able to generate all $2^k$ possible labelings on $S$ using hypotheses from $H$.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nLet's assume that a set $S \\subseteq X$ with $|S|=k$ can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. We want to find the maximum possible value of $k$.\n\n1.  If $S$ is shattered, then any labeling of its $k$ points can be realized by some hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$.\n2.  Consider a specific labeling for the points in $S$. Let's say this labeling assigns the label '1' to $i$ points and '0' to the other $k-i$ points, where $0 \\le i \\le k$.\n3.  To realize this labeling, we need to find a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ such that:\n    *   $h(x)=1$ for the $i$ specified points in $S$.\n    *   $h(x)=0$ for the other $k-i$ points in $S$.\n    *   The total number of points in $X$ for which $h(x)=1$ must be exactly $z$.\n4.  From the first point, we have already accounted for $i$ points being labeled '1'. To meet the overall requirement of $z$ points being labeled '1', the hypothesis $h$ must label an additional $z-i$ points as '1'. These points must be chosen from the set $X \\setminus S$ (the points in $X$ but not in $S$).\n5.  The size of the set $X \\setminus S$ is $|X| - |S| = T-k$.\n6.  For it to be possible to choose $z-i$ points from $X \\setminus S$ and label them '1', the following two conditions on the number of points must hold:\n    *   $z-i \\ge 0 \\implies i \\le z$ (We cannot choose a negative number of points).\n    *   $z-i \\le T-k$ (We cannot choose more points than are available in $X \\setminus S$).\n7.  Since the set $S$ is shattered, these two conditions must hold for **every** possible labeling of $S$. This means they must hold for all possible values of $i$, from $i=0$ to $i=k$. We need to check the most restrictive cases for $i$.\n    *   **Condition 1: $i \\le z$** must hold for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., k\\}$. The most demanding case is when $i$ is maximum, i.e., $i=k$. This corresponds to the labeling where all points in $S$ are '1'. So, we must have $k \\le z$.\n    *   **Condition 2: $z-i \\le T-k$** must hold for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., k\\}$. The most demanding case is when $i$ is minimum, i.e., $i=0$. This corresponds to the labeling where all points in $S$ are '0'. So, we must have $z-0 \\le T-k$, which simplifies to $z \\le T-k$ or $k \\le T-z$.\n8.  For a set of size $k$ to be shattered, both conditions must be satisfied. Therefore, $k$ must be less than or equal to both $z$ and $T-z$. This means $k \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n9.  This implies that the size of any shatterable set cannot exceed $\\min(z, T-z)$. This gives us an upper bound on the VC dimension:\n    $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nNow we show that we can indeed shatter a set of size $k = \\min(z, T-z)$. This will establish a lower bound.\n\n1.  Let $k = \\min(z, T-z)$. Let's pick an arbitrary set $S \\subseteq X$ with $|S|=k$.\n2.  To show that $S$ is shattered, we must demonstrate that for any arbitrary labeling of the points in $S$, we can find a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that generates it.\n3.  Let's consider an arbitrary labeling of $S$ with $i$ points labeled '1' and $k-i$ points labeled '0' (where $0 \\le i \\le k$).\n4.  We construct a hypothesis $h$ as follows:\n    *   For the $i$ points in $S$ that are labeled '1' in our target labeling, set $h(x)=1$.\n    *   We need the total count of ones to be $z$. We have used $i$ ones, so we need to label an additional $z-i$ points as '1'.\n    *   These additional points must be chosen from the complement set $X \\setminus S$, which has $T-k$ points.\n    *   Is this choice always possible? We need to verify that the number of points we need to choose, $z-i$, is a valid number, i.e., $0 \\le z-i \\le T-k$.\n5.  Let's check the two inequalities for any $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., k\\}$:\n    *   **Is $z-i \\ge 0$?**\n        Since we chose $k=\\min(z, T-z)$, we know that $k \\le z$. We also know that $i \\le k$. Combining these gives $i \\le k \\le z$, so $i \\le z$, which means $z-i \\ge 0$. This condition always holds.\n    *   **Is $z-i \\le T-k$?**\n        This inequality can be rewritten as $k+z-T \\le i$. From our choice of $k=\\min(z, T-z)$, we know that $k \\le T-z$. This implies $k+z \\le T$, or $k+z-T \\le 0$. Since $i$ can be any integer from $0$ to $k$, its minimum value is $0$. As $k+z-T \\le 0$ and $i \\ge 0$, the inequality $k+z-T \\le i$ is always true. This condition also always holds.\n6.  Since for any labeling of $S$ (defined by any $i \\in \\{0, ..., k\\}$), we can always find $z-i$ points in the complement $X \\setminus S$ to complete the hypothesis, we can construct a valid hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$.\n7.  Therefore, any set of size $k = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. This establishes a lower bound for the VC dimension:\n    $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the upper bound from Step 2 and the lower bound from Step 3, we have:\n$VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n$VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nThus, the VC dimension of the class $H_{z-ones}$ is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n*   The core of the problem is realizing that a hypothesis $h$ must satisfy two constraints: matching the labeling on the sample set $S$ and satisfying the global property of having exactly $z$ ones on the whole domain $X$.\n*   For the upper bound, one must reason about the limitations these constraints impose on *all* possible labelings of a shattered set, particularly the most demanding ones (all-ones and all-zeros).\n*   For the lower bound, one must show that for a set of the proposed VC dimension size, *any* labeling can be successfully extended to a valid hypothesis in the class.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
