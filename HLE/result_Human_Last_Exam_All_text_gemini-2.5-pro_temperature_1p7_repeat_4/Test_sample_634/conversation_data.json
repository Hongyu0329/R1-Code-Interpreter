    "Answering this question requires finding the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Step-by-step analysis of the question and required concepts:**\n\n*   **Given Polynomial Matrices:**\n    *   $P_1(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    *   $P_2(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n*   **Definition of GCRD:** A polynomial matrix $G(s)$ is a greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$ if:\n    1.  $G(s)$ is a common right divisor, meaning there exist polynomial matrices $Q_1(s)$ and $Q_2(s)$ such that $P_1(s) = Q_1(s)G(s)$ and $P_2(s) = Q_2(s)G(s)$.\n    2.  For any other common right divisor $E(s)$, $E(s)$ is a right divisor of $G(s)$, i.e., $G(s) = L(s)E(s)$ for some polynomial matrix $L(s)$.\n    *   A GCRD is not unique. If $G(s)$ is a GCRD, then so is $U(s)G(s)$ for any unimodular matrix $U(s)$ (a square polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant). Typically, a canonical form like the identity matrix, or a matrix in Hermite form, is provided as the answer.\n\n*   **Method for finding the GCRD:** A standard method is to use a matrix version of the Euclidean algorithm. This involves performing elementary row operations on the vertically stacked matrix of $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$.\n    1.  Form the stacked matrix $M(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    2.  Use elementary row operations to reduce $M(s)$ to an upper triangular (or row-echelon) form like $\\begin{bmatrix} G(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, where $G(s)$ is a square matrix.\n    3.  The resulting matrix $G(s)$ is a GCRD of $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$.\n\n**2. Acquiring the final answer with step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M(s).**\n$M(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\nLet's label the rows R1, R2, R3, R4.\n\n**Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to reduce M(s).**\nThe goal is to introduce zero rows. We use rows with lower polynomial degrees to simplify rows with higher degrees. Notice that R1 and R4 are related.\n*   **Operation 1:** Replace R1 with R1 + s*R4.\n    $R1_{new} = [s^2 + s, -s] + s \\cdot [-s-1, 1]$\n    $R1_{new} = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = [0, 0]$\nThis simplifies the matrix significantly:\n$M(s) \\sim \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSince the first row is now zero, the GCRD of the original matrices is the same as the GCRD of the matrices formed by the remaining non-zero rows. Let's form a new matrix M'(s) with the non-zero rows and continue the reduction.\n$M'(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\nLabel the rows R1', R2', R3'.\n\n*   **Operation 2:** Use R2' to simplify R1'. Replace R1' with R1' + s*R2'.\n    $R1'_{new} = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s \\cdot [s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2]$\nThe matrix becomes:\n$M'(s) \\sim \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\nLet's call this new R1', `R1''`.\n\n*   **Operation 3:** Use the new `R1''` to simplify the other rows. Its first element is a constant, which is ideal for elimination.\n    *   Replace R2' with R2' + s*`R1''`:\n        $R2'_{new} = [s, 0] + s \\cdot [-1, s^2] = [s - s, s^3] = [0, s^3]$\n    *   Replace R3' with R3' + (s+1)*`R1''`:\n        $R3'_{new} = [-s-1, 1] + (s+1) \\cdot [-1, s^2] = [-s-1 - (s+1), 1 + (s+1)s^2] = [0, 1 + s^3 + s^2]$\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form:\n$M(s) \\sim \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & s^2 \\\\ 0 & s^3 \\\\ 0 & 1 + s^3 + s^2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n*   **Operation 4:** We continue reducing using the last two rows. We are effectively finding the GCD of the polynomials $s^3$ and $s^3+s^2+1$. Using the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials:\n    $GCD(s^3, s^3+s^2+1) = GCD(s^3, (s^3+s^2+1) - s^3) = GCD(s^3, s^2+1)$\n    $GCD(s^3, s^2+1) = GCD(s^3 - s(s^2+1), s^2+1) = GCD(-s, s^2+1)$\n    $GCD(-s, s^2+1) = GCD(-s, (s^2+1) + s(-s)) = GCD(-s, 1) = 1$\nSince the GCD is 1, we can use row operations on the last two rows to obtain a row `[0, 1]`.\n\n*   **Operation 5:** With a row `[0, 1]`, we can further simplify the matrix.\n    The current non-zero rows forming our GCRD candidate are `[-1, s^2]` and `[0, 1]` (since the GCD is 1, the space spanned by `[0, s^3]` and `[0, s^3+s^2+1]` is the same as that spanned by `[0,1]`). Let the GCRD matrix be formed by these rows:\n    $G(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & s^2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    We can simplify this further. Replace its first row R1 with R1 - s^2 * R2:\n    $R1_{new} = [-1, s^2] - s^2 \\cdot [0, 1] = [-1, 0]$\n    So, an even simpler GCRD is:\n    $G'(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**Step 3: Finalizing the answer.**\nThe matrix $G'(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is a valid GCRD. Its determinant is -1, which is a non-zero constant, confirming it is unimodular.\nWhen the GCRD is unimodular, it means the original matrices are right coprime. In such cases, any unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD.\nThe most standard and canonical representation for a GCRD of coprime matrices is the identity matrix, $I$. We can obtain $I$ from $G'(s)$ by one more row operation: multiplying the first row by -1. This corresponds to left-multiplication by the unimodular matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n$I = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} G'(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor in its simplest canonical form is the identity matrix."
