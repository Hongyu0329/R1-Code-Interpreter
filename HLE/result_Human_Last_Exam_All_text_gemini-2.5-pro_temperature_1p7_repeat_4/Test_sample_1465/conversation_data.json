    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the coiled-coil protein sequences to determine their oligomeric states.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization:**\n    Coiled-coils are protein structural motifs where alpha-helices are wound around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-residue repeat, known as a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The oligomeric state (the number of helices in the coil, e.g., dimer, trimer) is primarily dictated by the amino acids at the core positions, `a` and `d`. The side chains of these residues pack against each other in the center of the helical bundle, and their size, shape, and polarity determine the most stable packing arrangement.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Determinants in Each Sequence:**\n    The provided sequences are highly regular and appear to be designed peptides, each intended to test a specific rule of oligomerization based on its core `a` and `d` residues. The most robust analysis method is to identify the unique `a`/`d` pairing motif in each sequence and apply the known rules from protein design literature. We will assume a consistent phasing where a key residue like Isoleucine (`I`) is at the `a` position.\n\n### Careful Analysis of Each Sequence:\n\n*   **Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This sequence features a repeating motif with Isoleucine (`I`) and Alanine (`A`) in potential `a` and `d` positions (e.g., `I` at position 2, `A` at position 5).\n    *   **Key Determinant:** The core pairing is **(I, A)**.\n    *   **Rule:** A bulky hydrophobic residue like Isoleucine at position `a` paired with a small hydrophobic residue like Alanine at `d` allows for efficient \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, which is characteristic of a dimeric coiled-coil.\n    *   **Oligomeric State:** **Dimer (2)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This sequence is less regular than the others, but its most striking feature is the presence of an Asparagine (`N`) residue at position 17.\n    *   **Key Determinant:** The presence of **Asparagine (N)** in the core.\n    *   **Rule:** Asparagine is polar. Placing it in the hydrophobic core is generally unfavorable unless it can form a network of stabilizing hydrogen bonds. This is optimally achieved in a trimeric arrangement where the Asn side chains point towards the center of the bundle. The presence of Asn in a core position is a classic and powerful determinant for a trimer.\n    *   **Oligomeric State:** **Trimer (3)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This sequence consistently repeats an `I`...`I` pattern (e.g., `I` at pos 2, `I` at pos 5, etc., in one possible phasing), suggesting Isoleucine is at both the `a` and `d` core positions.\n    *   **Key Determinant:** The core pairing is **(I, I)**.\n    *   **Rule:** Isoleucine has a bulky, branched side chain. Placing `I` at both the `a` and `d` positions creates significant steric strain in lower-order oligomers. This strain is relieved in a four-helix bundle, making the tetramer the most stable state.\n    *   **Oligomeric State:** **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The defining pattern in this sequence is the pairing of Isoleucine (`I`) and Glutamine (`Q`) in the core positions.\n    *   **Key Determinant:** The core pairing is **(I, Q)**.\n    *   **Rule:** Similar to Asparagine, Glutamine (`Q`) is a polar residue. When placed in the core at the `d` position, with `I` at the `a` position, it forms a specific hydrogen-bonded network that is most stable in a five-helix arrangement.\n    *   **Oligomeric State:** **Pentamer (5)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This sequence's key feature is the pairing of Isoleucine (`I`) and Threonine (`T`) in the core.\n    *   **Key Determinant:** The core pairing is **(I, T)**.\n    *   **Rule:** Threonine (`T`) is both polar and has a branched side chain (like Isoleucine). Placing it in the core introduces both steric and polar constraints. Experimental studies have shown that this specific pairing is uniquely accommodated in a seven-helix bundle.\n    *   **Oligomeric State:** **Heptamer (7)**.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the key determining residues in the core of each sequence, the oligomeric states are:\n1.  **2** (Dimer)\n2.  **3** (Trimer)\n3.  **4** (Tetramer)\n4.  **5** (Pentamer)\n5.  **7** (Heptamer)\n\nThe sequence of oligomeric states is therefore **2, 3, 4, 5, 7**. This corresponds to answer choice F.\n\n<<<F>>>"
