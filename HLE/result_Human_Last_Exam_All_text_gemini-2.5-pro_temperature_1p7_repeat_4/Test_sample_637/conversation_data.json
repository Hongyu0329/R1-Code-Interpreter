    "Answering this question involves designing a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system. A deadbeat observer is one where the state estimation error converges to zero in the minimum possible number of time steps. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics matrix at the origin (z=0).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **System and Observer Dynamics**\n    The discrete-time system is given by:\n    x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\n    y(k) = Cx(k)\n\n    A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1], B = [0; 1; -1; 1], C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n\n    A full-order observer is designed as:\n    x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))\n    where x_hat is the estimated state, y_hat = Cx_hat(k) is the estimated output, and L is the observer gain matrix to be designed.\n\n2.  **Error Dynamics**\n    Let the estimation error be e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k). The error dynamics can be derived as:\n    e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n    The goal of a deadbeat observer is to make the error e(k) identically zero as quickly as possible. This requires the matrix (A - LC) to be nilpotent, meaning (A - LC)^m = 0 for some integer m. This is achieved by placing all eigenvalues of (A - LC) at the origin.\n\n3.  **Pole Placement Objective**\n    The system state dimension is n=4. Therefore, we need to place all four eigenvalues of the matrix A_o = A - LC at z=0. The characteristic polynomial of A_o must be:\n    det(zI - A_o) = z^4\n\n4.  **Calculating the Observer Gain Matrix L**\n    The observer gain matrix L has dimensions n x p, which is 4x2 in this case. Let's denote it as:\n    L = [[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]]\n\n    Next, we compute the matrix product LC:\n    LC = [[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]] * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]\n       = [[l11+l12, 0, 0, l12],\n          [l21+l22, 0, 0, l22],\n          [l31+l32, 0, 0, l32],\n          [l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]]\n\n    Now, we form the observer error matrix A_o = A - LC:\n    A_o = [[-1-(l11+l12), 0, 0, 1-l12],\n           [1-(l21+l22),  0, 0, 2-l22],\n           [-(l31+l32),   1, 0, -1-l32],\n           [-1-(l41+l42), 0, 1, -1-l42]]\n\n    We need to find the characteristic polynomial det(zI - A_o) and set it equal to z^4. This yields four equations for the eight unknown elements of L, which is computationally intensive. A more structured approach is to simplify the matrix A_o first.\n\n5.  **Simplified Structured Approach**\n    Let's choose L such that the first column of A_o becomes a zero vector. This gives us four equations:\n    -1 - (l11+l12) = 0  =>  l11 + l12 = -1\n     1 - (l21+l22) = 0  =>  l21 + l22 = 1\n     0 - (l31+l32) = 0  =>  l31 + l32 = 0\n    -1 - (l41+l42) = 0  =>  l41 + l42 = -1\n\n    With this choice, the A_o matrix simplifies to:\n    A_o = [[0, 0, 0, 1-l12],\n           [0, 0, 0, 2-l22],\n           [0, 1, 0, -1-l32],\n           [0, 0, 1, -1-l42]]\n\n    Now we compute the characteristic polynomial of this simplified matrix:\n    det(zI - A_o) = det([[z, 0, 0, -(1-l12)],\n                         [0, z, 0, -(2-l22)],\n                         [0, -1, z, 1+l32],\n                         [0, 0, -1, z+1+l42]])\n\n    Expanding the determinant along the first column gives:\n    det = z * [ z^3 + (1+l42)z^2 + (1+l32)z - (2-l22) ]\n        = z^4 + (1+l42)z^3 + (1+l32)z^2 - (2-l22)z\n\n    To make this polynomial equal to the desired z^4, the coefficients of the lower order terms (z^3, z^2, z^1) must be zero:\n    Coeff z^3: 1 + l42 = 0  =>  l42 = -1\n    Coeff z^2: 1 + l32 = 0  =>  l32 = -1\n    Coeff z^1: -(2 - l22) = 0  => l22 = 2\n\n6.  **Solving for L**\n    We have a system of 7 linear equations for the 8 unknowns in L. This means there is one degree of freedom, and we can choose a value for one of the variables to find a specific solution. Let's make the simple choice of `l12 = 0`.\n\n    Now we solve for the remaining elements:\n    - Given l12 = 0, from l11 + l12 = -1, we get `l11 = -1`.\n    - Given l22 = 2, from l21 + l22 = 1, we get `l21 = -1`.\n    - Given l32 = -1, from l31 + l32 = 0, we get `l31 = 1`.\n    - Given l42 = -1, from l41 + l42 = -1, we get `l41 = 0`.\n\n7.  **Final Observer Gain Matrix**\n    Assembling the values, we get the gain matrix L:\n    L = [[-1, 0],\n         [-1, 2],\n         [1, -1],\n         [0, -1]]\n\nThis gain matrix L will place all the observer poles at the origin, thus ensuring the observation error becomes identically zero in the shortest possible number of steps (at most n=4 steps).\n\n<<<[[-1, 0], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
