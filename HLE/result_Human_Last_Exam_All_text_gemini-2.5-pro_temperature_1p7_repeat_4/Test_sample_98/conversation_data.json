    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Object and its Orientation:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. It is \"standing on one of its faces,\" which means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Water Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" A key property of a regular icosahedron is that it is centrally symmetric, meaning it has a center point, and for any point in the solid, the point directly opposite through the center is also in the solid. A plane passing through this center of symmetry will always divide the solid into two equal volumes. Since the water fills exactly half the volume and gravity dictates that the water surface must be a horizontal plane, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Identify the Shape of the Water Surface:** The question asks for the shape of the water surface. This shape is the polygon formed by the intersection of the central horizontal plane with the faces of the icosahedron tank. This is also known as a cross-section.\n\n4.  **Use Symmetry to Constrain the Shape:**\n    *   **Rotational Symmetry:** When an icosahedron stands on a face, the vertical line passing through the center of the bottom face and the center of the parallel top face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Since the water surface is a horizontal plane, it is perpendicular to this axis. Therefore, the shape of the cross-section must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Central Symmetry (Inversion Symmetry):** As established in step 2, the water surface passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry. This means that for any point on the boundary of the water's surface, the point directly opposite it through the center is also on the boundary. Therefore, the shape must be centrally symmetric.\n\n5.  **Deduce the Polygon Shape:** A polygon that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and is centrally symmetric must have a number of vertices that is an even multiple of 3. The smallest such number is 6 (2 * 3 = 6). Since the icosahedron is a convex shape, its cross-section with a plane must be a convex polygon. The simplest convex polygon that satisfies these symmetry requirements is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n6.  **Confirmation using Duality (an alternative method):**\n    *   The dual polyhedron of an icosahedron is a dodecahedron (which has 12 pentagonal faces).\n    *   An icosahedron resting on a face is the dual configuration to a dodecahedron resting on a vertex.\n    *   The vertical 3-fold axis passing through the centers of the opposite faces of the icosahedron corresponds to a 3-fold axis passing through opposite vertices of the dodecahedron.\n    *   The central horizontal plane cutting the icosahedron corresponds to a central plane cutting the dodecahedron, perpendicular to its 3-fold axis.\n    *   It is a known result in geometry that the cross-section of a dodecahedron by a central plane perpendicular to a 3-fold axis is a **regular hexagon**.\n    *   By the principle of duality, the corresponding cross-section in our icosahedron problem must also be a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify that \"half-filled\" for a centrally symmetric object implies the dividing plane passes through the center.\n*   Recognizing the symmetry of the icosahedron when it stands on a face (a 3-fold vertical axis) is key to determining the symmetry of the resulting shape.\n*   The combination of 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry strongly constrains the shape to have a vertex count that is a multiple of 6.\n*   Directly counting the intersected edges or faces by visualizing the structure is complex and prone to error. Relying on the high-level symmetry arguments is a more robust method.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the symmetry analysis, the shape of the water surface is a convex polygon with 6-fold symmetry (combined 3-fold and central symmetry), which is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
