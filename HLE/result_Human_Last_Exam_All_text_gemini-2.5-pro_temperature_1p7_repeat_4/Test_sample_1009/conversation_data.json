    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions and Given Properties**\n\n*   **Topological Group (G):** A group with a topology where multiplication and inversion are continuous.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-Countable:** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. This means the character of the group, χ(G), is ℵ₀.\n*   **Cardinality |G|:** The number of elements in G is 2^(2^c), where c = 2^ℵ₀ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Weight w(G):** The smallest cardinality of a base for the topology of G.\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** The group is not required to be a Hausdorff (T₂) space. This is a critical piece of information.\n\n**2. Analyze the Role of the Hausdorff Axiom**\n\nLet's first see what would happen if G were Hausdorff.\n*   For any Hausdorff topological space X, a fundamental inequality is |X| ≤ 2^χ(X) * L(X), where χ(X) is the character and L(X) is the Lindelöf number.\n*   For our group G, being first-countable means χ(G) = ℵ₀.\n*   Being compact means it is also Lindelöf, so L(G) = 1.\n*   If G were Hausdorff, this would imply |G| ≤ 2^(ℵ₀ * 1) = 2^ℵ₀ = c.\n*   However, we are given that |G| = 2^(2^c).\n*   The inequality 2^(2^c) ≤ c is false.\n*   This contradiction shows that **no such Hausdorff group exists**, and the non-Hausdorff property is essential to the problem.\n\n**3. General Inequalities and Properties of Topological Groups**\n\nFor a general topological group G (not necessarily Hausdorff):\n*   **Upper Bound on Weight:** For any first-countable topological group G, a basis can be constructed from a countable local base {U_n} at the identity element e, by taking all translates {gU_n | g ∈ G, n ∈ ω}. The cardinality of this basis is at most |G| · ℵ₀. Since |G| = 2^(2^c) is an infinite cardinal, this is equal to |G|. Thus, we have an upper bound:\n    w(G) ≤ |G| = 2^(2^c).\n\n*   **The Kolmogorov Quotient:** Let N = cl({e}) be the closure of the identity element. In a topological group, N is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group G/N is a T₀ topological group. Since it's a T₀ topological group, it is also completely regular and Hausdorff (T₂).\n    *   The quotient map π: G → G/N is continuous, open, and surjective.\n    *   Since G is compact, its continuous image G/N is also compact.\n    *   Since G is first-countable and the quotient map is open, G/N is also first-countable.\n    *   So, G/N is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. From Step 2, we know its cardinality must be at most c. So, |G/N| ≤ c.\n\n*   **Relationship between Cardinalities:** We have the relation |G| = |G/N| · |N|.\n    *   2^(2^c) = |G/N| · |N|.\n    *   Since |G/N| ≤ c, it must be that |N| = 2^(2^c).\n\n*   **Relationship between Weights:** For a topological group G with a compact subgroup N, the following relation holds: w(G) = w(G/N) · w(N) = max(w(G/N), w(N)).\n    *   N = cl({e}) is a closed subgroup of a compact group G, so N is compact.\n    *   G/N is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group, which implies it is metrizable. Therefore, its weight w(G/N) = ℵ₀.\n    *   Substituting this into the formula, we get w(G) = max(ℵ₀, w(N)). Assuming w(N) is infinite (which we will confirm), we have w(G) = w(N).\n\n**4. Finding the Lower Bound for the Weight**\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the largest possible weight of the subgroup N.\nLet's list the properties of N:\n1.  N is a topological group.\n2.  N is compact (closed subset of compact G).\n3.  N is first-countable (subspace of first-countable G), so χ(N) = ℵ₀.\n4.  |N| = 2^(2^c).\n\n*   For any topological group H that is a Lindelöf p-space (which compact groups are), the following inequality by Arhangel'skii holds: |H| ≤ 2^(d(H)χ(H)), where d(H) is the density of H. For any σ-compact group H, we have w(H) = d(H)χ(H). Since compact groups are σ-compact, and H being first-countable means χ(H) = ℵ₀, we have w(H) = d(H)·ℵ₀ = d(H) (if d(H) is infinite).\n*   Even without relying on the formula for weight, there's a more direct inequality for the cardinality: for any Lindelöf Σ-space (which includes compact groups), |H| ≤ w(H)^χ(H).\n*   Applying this inequality to the group N:\n    |N| ≤ w(N)^χ(N)\n    2^(2^c) ≤ w(N)^ℵ₀\n\n*   Let's analyze this inequality to find a lower bound for w(N). Suppose w(N) < 2^c. Let κ = w(N). Then κ < 2^c.\n    *   The term κ^ℵ₀ can be bounded. In ZFC, it is provable that if κ < 2^c, then κ^c = 2^c. As c = c^ℵ₀, we have κ^ℵ₀ ≤ κ^c = 2^c.\n    *   This leads to the inequality 2^(2^c) ≤ 2^c, which is a clear contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, the assumption w(N) < 2^c must be false. This gives us the lower bound:\n        w(N) ≥ 2^c.\n\n*   Since w(G) = w(N), we have w(G) ≥ 2^c.\n\n**5. Conclusion: Determining the Largest Possible Weight**\n\nWe have established the following bounds for the weight of G:\n*   Lower bound: w(G) ≥ 2^c\n*   Upper bound: w(G) ≤ |G| = 2^(2^c)\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* weight. This implies we should look for the maximum value in the possible range [2^c, 2^(2^c)], assuming a group with that weight can be constructed.\n\nIn the theory of topological groups, especially concerning cardinal invariants, it is often the case that general upper bounds derived from the cardinality are sharp. While the specific construction of a group G that satisfies all the given properties and has w(G) = 2^(2^c) is highly complex and deep in the field of abstract topology, there are no known theorems in ZFC that would prevent such a group from existing. The pathologies allowed by dropping the Hausdorff axiom are immense. For the weight to be strictly less than the cardinality, a theorem like \"for any such group G, d(G) < |G|\" would be required. While this is true for infinite compact *Hausdorff* spaces, it is not true in the non-Hausdorff case (e.g., a group with the trivial topology is compact but its density is 1, far less than its cardinality).\n\nGiven that no theorem provides a tighter upper bound, the largest possible weight is the upper bound we derived from the group's cardinality.\n\nFinal value:\nLargest possible weight = |G| = 2^(2^c).\n\nFinal check:\nIf w(G) = 2^(2^c), do our inequalities hold?\n*   w(G) ≤ |G|: 2^(2^c) ≤ 2^(2^c). Yes.\n*   |G| ≤ w(G)^ℵ₀ (as |N| ≤ w(N)^ℵ₀ and w(G)=w(N), |G|≈|N|): 2^(2^c) ≤ (2^(2^c))^ℵ₀. This is true.\n\nThe largest possible weight is 2^(2^c)."
