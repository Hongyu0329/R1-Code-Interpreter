    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group of Size 128**\n\nThe group in question is the generalized quaternion group of order 128. Let's denote this group by $G = Q_{128}$. The standard presentation for a generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ is $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor $|G|=128$, we have $4n=128$, which implies $n=32$. So, the presentation for our group is:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nLet's list some key properties of this group:\n*   The order of the group is $|G| = 128 = 2^7$.\n*   The elements of $G$ can be written uniquely in the form $x^i$ or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\n*   The element $x$ has order $ord(x) = 64$. The subgroup generated by $x$, $H = \\langle x \\rangle$, is a cyclic subgroup of order 64. Since its index is $|G|/|H| = 128/64 = 2$, it is a maximal and normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   The element $y$ has order 4, since $y^4 = (y^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   The group elements are partitioned into two sets: the 64 elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$ and the 64 elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ (of the form $x^i y$).\n\n**2. Understand the Definition of a \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nA \"power subgroup\" of a group $G$ is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element of $G$. In other words, a power subgroup is a **cyclic subgroup**. The question is asking for the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups in $Q_{128}$.\n\n**3. Strategy: Count Cyclic Subgroups Based on Generator Type**\n\nWe can find all cyclic subgroups by considering all possible generators $g \\in G$. We will partition our counting based on whether the generator $g$ is in the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ or not.\n\n**Part A: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements within $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{64}$. A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $m$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$. The number of subgroups is therefore $\\tau(m)$, the number of divisors of $m$.\n\n*   The order of the subgroup is $m = 64 = 2^6$.\n*   The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1 = 7$.\n\nTherefore, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained entirely within $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are:\n1.  $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle$ (order 1)\n2.  $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n3.  $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n4.  $\\langle x^{8} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n5.  $\\langle x^{4} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n6.  $\\langle x^{2} \\rangle$ (order 32)\n7.  $\\langle x \\rangle$ (order 64)\n\n**Part B: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements outside $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nThese are subgroups generated by elements of the form $g = x^k y$, where $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n\n*   **Find the order of these elements:**\n    Let's compute the square of $g$:\n    $g^2 = (x^k y)^2 = x^k y x^k y$.\n    Using the relation $y x^k = (y x y^{-1})^k y = (x^{-1})^k y = x^{-k} y$.\n    So, $g^2 = x^k (x^{-k} y) y = (x^k x^{-k}) y^2 = 1 \\cdot y^2 = y^2$.\n    From the group presentation, $y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    So, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n    The element $x^{32}$ has order 2 (since $(x^{32})^2=x^{64}=1$). Therefore, the order of $g$ is 4 for any $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n\n*   **Count the number of distinct subgroups:**\n    Since all 64 elements of the form $x^k y$ have order 4, they each generate a cyclic subgroup of order 4. We need to find how many of these subgroups are distinct.\n    A cyclic group of order 4, say $H=\\langle g \\rangle$, has $\\phi(4)=2$ generators. The generators are $g$ and $g^3$.\n    Let's find $g^3$:\n    $g^3 = g^2 \\cdot g = x^{32} \\cdot (x^k y) = x^{k+32} y$.\n    So, the two generators of the subgroup $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$ are $x^k y$ and $x^{k+32} y$.\n    This implies that $\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\langle x^{k+32} y \\rangle$.\n    The 64 elements of the form $x^k y$ form pairs of generators for the same subgroup. The pairs are $\\{x^k y, x^{k+32} y\\}$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, 31$.\n    For example, $\\langle y \\rangle$ is the same subgroup as $\\langle x^{32} y \\rangle$.\n    Since there are 64 such elements, and they are grouped into pairs that generate the same subgroup, the number of distinct subgroups is $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\n**Part C: Combine the results**\n\nWe have found two sets of cyclic subgroups:\n1.  The **7** subgroups that are contained in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  The **32** subgroups that are generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint. A subgroup in the first set consists solely of powers of $x$. A subgroup in the second set contains elements of the form $x^k y$, which are not powers of $x$. Therefore, no subgroup can be in both sets.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the numbers from both sets.\nTotal number = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\nFinal Answer Checklist:\n*   Identified the group correctly? Yes, $Q_{128}$.\n*   Defined power subgroup correctly? Yes, as a cyclic subgroup.\n*   Counted cyclic subgroups inside $\\langle x \\rangle$? Yes, $\\tau(64)=7$.\n*   Counted cyclic subgroups outside $\\langle x \\rangle$? Yes, determined their order is 4 and counted the distinct ones, which is $64/2=32$.\n*   Are the sets of subgroups disjoint? Yes.\n*   Final sum is correct? Yes, $7+32=39$.\n\nThe analysis is complete and the steps are logically sound."
