    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the range of verses (abyat) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Poem's Structure:** The poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi is structured to teach the essential articles of Islamic faith in a sequential manner. After discussing the attributes of Allah, it moves on to the belief in His Messengers (the Prophets).\n\n2.  **Locating the Section on Prophets:** The discussion on the Prophets in general begins earlier in the poem. For instance, bayt (verse) 27 starts with, \"وَأَرْسَـلَ الأَنْـبِـيَـا ذَوِي فَـطَـانَـهْ\" (\"And He sent the Prophets, possessors of intelligence...\"). However, the question specifically asks for the verses that contain the **names** of the Prophets.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Introduction to the List:** Before listing the names, the author states that it is necessary to know the details of twenty-five of them. This is found in bayt 35:\n    *   **Bayt 35:** \"تَفْـصِـيْـلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْـرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\" (\"The detailed knowledge of twenty-five is binding...\")\n    This verse serves as the direct prelude to the list but does not yet contain any names.\n\n4.  **Pinpointing the Start of the List:** The actual enumeration of the Prophets' names begins in the verse immediately following the introduction.\n    *   **Bayt 37:** \"هُـمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْـسُ نُـوْحٌ هُـوْدُ مَـعْ\" (\"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with...\")\n    This is the first verse that explicitly mentions the names of the Prophets (Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud). Therefore, the list starts at **bayt 37**.\n\n5.  **Following the List to its Conclusion:** The names continue to be listed over the next several verses:\n    *   **Bayt 38:** Salih, Ibrahim\n    *   **Bayt 39:** Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq\n    *   **Bayt 40:** Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub\n    *   **Bayt 41:** Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa'\n    *   **Bayt 42:** Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman\n    *   **Bayt 43:** Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya\n\n6.  **Identifying the Final Verse of the List:** The list of twenty-five Prophets concludes in the next verse, which mentions the final two.\n    *   **Bayt 44:** \"عِـيْـسَى وَطَـهَ خَـاتَـمٌ دَعْ غَـيَّـا\" (\"'Isa and Taha, the Seal [of the prophets], leave misguidance.\")\n    This verse contains the final names in the list: 'Isa (Jesus) and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ). This marks the end of the enumeration.\n\n7.  **Confirming the End Point:** The verse immediately following this, bayt 45, shifts topic from naming the Prophets to sending prayers upon them (\"عَـلَـيْـهِـمُ الـصَّـلاةُ وَالـسَّـلامُ\" - \"Upon them be prayers and peace...\"). This confirms that the list of names itself concluded in bayt 44.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Distinction:** It is important to distinguish between the general section discussing the attributes of Prophets (which starts earlier) and the specific section that lists their names.\n*   **Starting Point:** The listing does not begin at verse 35, which is the instruction to know the names, but at verse 37, where the names first appear.\n*   **Ending Point:** The list concludes with the mention of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (referred to as Taha) in verse 44. The following verse is a benediction (prayer) and not part of the list itself.\n*   **'Taha':** The name 'Taha' in verse 44 is a well-known title for the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is the final Prophet in the list.\n\n### **Conclusion of Analysis**\n\nBased on the step-by-step examination of the poem's text, the names of the twenty-five Prophets are mentioned starting from bayt 37 and concluding in bayt 44.\n\n<<<From bayt 37 to bayt 44.>>>"
