The solutions found are on the real and imaginary axes.
1.  Real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.
2.  Purely imaginary solutions: An infinite set $z_m = -iu_m$ for $m \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$, where $u_m$ is the unique positive real solution to the equation $u = \exp\left(-u \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}(4m-1)\right)$. Using the Lambert W function, this is expressed as $u_m = \frac{W\left(\frac{\pi}{2}(4m-1)\right)}{\frac{\pi}{2}(4m-1)}$.
