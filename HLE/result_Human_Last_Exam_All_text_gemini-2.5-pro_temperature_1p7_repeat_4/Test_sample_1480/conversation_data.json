    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms and values provided in the question:\n\n*   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS):** This specifies the context. IT3 FS are an advanced form of fuzzy sets used to handle very high levels of uncertainty. In an IT3 Fuzzy Logic System, the membership degrees are not simple numbers but Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2 FS).\n*   **Rule Activation Level:** This is another term for the \"firing strength\" or \"firing level\" of a fuzzy rule. It represents the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the rule is satisfied by the current inputs. This value is determined *before* considering the consequent (the \"THEN\" part).\n*   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: This represents the membership grade of an input `x'` in the antecedent fuzzy set for rule `k`. In the complex context of IT3 FS, a single scalar value like `0.7` is a simplification. It most likely represents the upper bound of the FOU (Footprint of Uncertainty) of the resulting membership, which is an IT2 FS.\n*   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: This notation typically denotes the membership of an output value `y_j` in a *consequent* fuzzy set `G`. However, the rule activation level is calculated exclusively from the *antecedents*. This leads to two possibilities:\n    1.  This information is irrelevant to the question.\n    2.  The notation is unconventional, and this value actually represents the membership grade for a *second antecedent* in the same rule. This interpretation is more likely in a problem-solving context as it uses all given information.\n*   **T-norm Operation:** This is a class of functions used in fuzzy logic to model the logical \"AND\" connective. When a rule has multiple antecedents (e.g., `IF condition_1 AND condition_2`), a t-norm is used to combine their individual membership grades into a single rule activation level.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Assumptions\n\n1.  **Interpretation of Inputs:** We will assume the rule has two antecedents connected by an \"AND\" operator. The degrees to which these two antecedents are met are given by the scalar values `0.7` and `0.9`. These scalars are assumed to be the upper bounds of the FOU for their respective IT3 membership evaluations.\n    *   Antecedent 1 membership `(μ_A1)` = `Phi_k(x′)` = 0.7\n    *   Antecedent 2 membership `(μ_A2)` = `μG_k_j(y_j)` = 0.9 (assuming it's an antecedent)\n2.  **Role of the Consequent:** The activation level is independent of the consequent part of the rule. The value calculated is what will later be applied to the consequent set, but the value itself does not depend on the consequent.\n3.  **Choice of T-norm:** The question specifies using a \"t-norm\" but doesn't state which one (e.g., minimum, product, Łukasiewicz). In the absence of specific instructions, the most standard and widely used t-norm for the fuzzy \"AND\" operation is the **minimum** operator. We will proceed using the minimum t-norm.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\nBased on the interpretations above, the problem simplifies to combining the two antecedent membership grades using a minimum t-norm.\n\n1.  **Identify the antecedent membership grades:**\n    *   Membership Grade 1 = 0.7\n    *   Membership Grade 2 = 0.9\n\n2.  **Identify the operation:**\n    *   The antecedents are combined using a t-norm, which we assume is the `min` function.\n\n3.  **Apply the t-norm:**\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `t-norm(Membership Grade 1, Membership Grade 2)`\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the result:**\n    *   The minimum value between 0.7 and 0.9 is 0.7.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
