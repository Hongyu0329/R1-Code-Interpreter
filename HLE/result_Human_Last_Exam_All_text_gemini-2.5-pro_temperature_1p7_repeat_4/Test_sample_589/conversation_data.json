    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks for a specific Hollywood feature film produced by a major studio with a scene containing four key elements:\n1.  A character who is a **teenager**.\n2.  The teenager is riding a **pink bike**.\n3.  The teenager is **pedaling directly toward an oncoming car**.\n4.  The film is a **Hollywood feature film** from a **major studio**.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm Potential Films and Evaluate Key Elements**\nLet's consider films known for memorable scenes involving teenagers and bicycles, and then check them against the specific criteria.\n\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*** **(1982):** Features kids and teenagers on bikes, but the iconic scene is about flying. The bikes are not pink, and they are not riding toward an oncoming car in a confrontational manner.\n*   ***A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge*** **(1985):** This film features the teenage protagonist, Jesse, riding a bike that is distinctively pink/magenta. However, in the relevant scene, he is being chased by a school bus driven by Freddy Krueger; he is not deliberately pedaling *toward* it. This does not fully match the prompt's description of the action.\n*   ***It*** **(2017):** The teenage members of the Losers' Club ride bikes frequently. There is a scene where bully Henry Bowers drives his car toward Stanley Uris, who is on his bike. However, Stanley's bike is not pink, and his action is one of being frozen by fear before evading the car, not deliberately pedaling toward it.\n*   ***Napoleon Dynamite*** **(2004):** Napoleon is a teenager who rides a bike, but his bike is a red Huffy, not pink. No scene matches the description.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Correct Film by Focusing on the Specific Combination of Elements**\nThe combination of a \"teenager,\" a \"pink bike,\" and \"pedaling directly toward an oncoming car\" points to a very specific and memorable running gag in one particular film.\n\n*   **Film:** ***Better Off Dead...*** **(1985)**\n*   **Studio:** Produced by A&M Films and distributed by CBS Productions (with current distribution by major studio Warner Bros.), it is a well-known Hollywood feature film. This satisfies criterion #4.\n*   **Character:** The film features a recurring antagonist, the paperboy, who is portrayed as a persistent teenager (or pre-teen). This satisfies criterion #1.\n*   **The Bike:** The paperboy relentlessly pursues the main character for \"two dollars\" while riding a bright **pink bicycle**. This satisfies criterion #2.\n*   **The Action:** In multiple scenes, the paperboy appears out of nowhere and **pedals directly at the main character's oncoming car** in a game of chicken, forcing the driver to swerve. This action is a perfect match for criterion #3.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe 1985 film *Better Off Dead...* contains a recurring scene where a tenacious paperboy on a pink bike repeatedly pedals directly toward the protagonist's oncoming car, demanding \"two dollars.\" This sequence perfectly matches all the detailed points in the question.\n\n<<<Better Off Dead..."
