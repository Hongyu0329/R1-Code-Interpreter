The most common reason a functional MRI receive coil shows no resonance when probed is due to its **active detuning circuit**. This safety mechanism, typically using PIN diodes, is designed to intentionally destroy the coil's resonance during the MRI scanner's high-power transmit pulse to prevent patient burns and protect the electronics. When the coil is disconnected from the scanner, this circuit often defaults to its "safe," non-resonant state. The coil is only commanded to become resonant by the scanner during the brief data acquisition window. Therefore, while perfectly functional in its intended environment, it appears non-resonant during a benchtop test. Other, less common possibilities include the coil being a **gradiometer type**, which is designed to reject the uniform magnetic field from your probe, or the probe being placed in a **magnetic field null** of the coil.
