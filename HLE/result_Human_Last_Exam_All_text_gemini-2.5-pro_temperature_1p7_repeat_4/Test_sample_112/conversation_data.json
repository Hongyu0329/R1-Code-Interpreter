    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the primary subject of the question.**\nThe question is about the Middle English romance poem \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n**Step 2: Understand the context of the question.**\nThe question asks what \"book of manners\" was \"preserved alongside\" Sir Launfal. This implies that the poem survives in a manuscript that also contains other works, one of which is a book of manners (also known as a courtesy book).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the manuscript containing \"Sir Launfal.\"**\nThe poem \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre, is preserved in a single manuscript. This manuscript is known as **MS Cotton Caligula A.ii**, which is held in the British Library. It is a famous miscellany (a collection of various texts) from the 15th century.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the contents of the manuscript to find a \"book of manners.\"**\nBy consulting a catalogue or description of the contents of MS Cotton Caligula A.ii, we can see the list of texts it contains. In addition to \"Sir Launfal,\" the manuscript includes other romances and poems. Critically, it also contains a short instructional poem on etiquette and behavior, particularly for young people at the dinner table.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the specific title of this book of manners.**\nThe courtesy book found in this manuscript is a work known as **\"The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke\"** (The Little Children's Little Book). This text provides guidance on good conduct, making it a classic example of a medieval \"book of manners.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Manuscript vs. Text:** It is crucial to distinguish between the literary work (\"Sir Launfal\") and the physical object it was written in (the manuscript, Cotton Caligula A.ii). The question is about the other contents of this specific physical manuscript.\n2.  **Medieval Miscellanies:** Understand that medieval manuscripts were often compilations of various texts that the compiler or patron found interesting or useful. The works were not always thematically related, though sometimes they were grouped intentionally.\n3.  **Genre Identification:** A \"book of manners\" is a specific genre of instructional literature, also called a \"courtesy book.\" These texts taught proper social conduct, etiquette, and morals.\n4.  **Specific Title:** The title \"The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke\" is specific to the version found in this manuscript. The Middle English spelling can vary, but this is the most common identification for the work in question.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the poem \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in the manuscript MS Cotton Caligula A.ii. This same manuscript also contains a courtesy book, or book of manners. That book is titled \"The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke.\"\n\n<<<The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke>>>"
