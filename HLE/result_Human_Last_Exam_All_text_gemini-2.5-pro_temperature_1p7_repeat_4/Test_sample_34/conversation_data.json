    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Hand type:** Suited Jack (JXs, where X is another card of the same suit, from A down to 2). We are looking for the \"worst\" one. The candidates are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. (Note: JQs, KQs, and AJs are better hands and not typically considered in the \"JXs\" category for this type of question, which focuses on the lower part of the range).\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the latest and most powerful position pre-flop, allowing for the widest opening range.\n*   **Action:** Open-raise to 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard opening size.\n*   **Game Conditions:** 100 Big Blinds (BB) effective stacks in a rake-free cash game. The \"rake-free\" part is crucial. In a real game with rake, the profitability of marginal hands decreases. In a rake-free environment, any hand with a positive expected value (+EV), no matter how small, is a correct open-raise. This means our opening range will be at its theoretical maximum width.\n\n**Step 2: How to Evaluate the \"Goodness\" of a Suited Hand**\n\nSuited hands derive their value from several factors, which we can use to rank them:\n1.  **High Card Strength:** The ability to make strong top pairs. A higher kicker is always better. For example, if you flop a Jack, having JTs is much stronger than having J2s.\n2.  **Straight Potential:** The ability to make straights. Hands with cards close in rank (connectors like JTs or one-gappers like J9s) are much stronger than hands with large gaps (like J4s or J3s).\n3.  **Flush Potential:** All suited hands can make flushes. However, a higher hand like JTs can make a stronger Jack-high flush and has a slightly better chance of being the best hand compared to J2s if an opponent also has a flush.\n4.  **Playability/Board Coverage:** Connected hands can hit draws on many more different board textures than disconnected hands, making them easier and more profitable to play post-flop.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the Suited Jacks**\n\nUsing the criteria above, let's rank the candidate hands from best to worst.\n*   **JTs:** This is the best hand in the group. It's a strong connector with good high-card value. It can make the nut straight (with A-K-Q) and many other straights.\n*   **J9s:** A strong one-gapper. It has good straight potential (e.g., with Q-T-8) and a solid kicker.\n*   **J8s:** A two-gapper. The connectivity starts to decrease, but it's still a very playable hand.\n*   **J7s:** A three-gapper. Weaker than J8s but still retains some straight-making ability with middle cards.\n*   **J6s:** Weaker still. The large gap between J and 6 makes it difficult for them to work together to make a straight.\n*   **J5s:** This hand is interesting. While it has a very large gap, the 5-card has unique properties because it connects to low cards (A-2-3-4). This gives J5s slightly more straight potential on a wider variety of board textures than J4s, J3s, or J2s.\n*   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest hands in the group. They have virtually no straight potential involving both cards. Their value comes almost exclusively from making a flush or a top pair with a very weak kicker, which can be easily out-kicked.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"Worst\" Hand That is Still a Profitable Open**\n\nThe question asks for the \"worst suited jack you *should* open\". In a rake-free GTO (Game Theory Optimal) environment from the button, you should open an extremely wide range of handsâ€”essentially any hand that generates profit. GTO solvers show that against a standard Big Blind defending range, *all* suited jacks (from JTs down to J2s) are profitable opens from the button.\n\nSince all of them are considered profitable opens, the \"worst\" one is the hand with the lowest expected value (EV).\n\nBased on our ranking in Step 3, the hierarchy of value from lowest to highest is:\nJ2s < J3s < J4s < J5s ... < J9s < JTs.\n\nThe hand J2s has the lowest kicker and the worst connectivity, making it the least profitable hand in this category. Therefore, it is the worst suited jack that you should still open-raise from the button in this scenario.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
