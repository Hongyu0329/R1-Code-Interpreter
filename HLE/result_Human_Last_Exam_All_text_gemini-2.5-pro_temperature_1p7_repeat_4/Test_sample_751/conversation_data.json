    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality and find the new matrix C.\n\n**The System:**\nThe discrete-time system is given by:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\nwith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\n**Goal:**\nFind the new output matrix, C_o, for the system in observer canonical form.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Duality Principle**\nThe principle of duality states that the problem of transforming a system (A, C) to observer canonical form is dual to transforming the system (A^T, C^T) to controller canonical form.\n\n*   **Original System (S1):** (A, C)\n*   **Dual System (S2):** (A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)\n\nIf a transformation matrix `Q` puts the dual system S2 into controller canonical form (A_c, B_c), such that:\n`A_c = Q * A_d * Q^(-1)`\n`B_c = Q * B_d`\n\nThen, the observer canonical form (A_o, C_o) for the original system S1 is given by:\n`A_o = A_c^T`\n`C_o = B_c^T`\n\nFrom this, we can derive the expression for the new output matrix `C_o`:\n`C_o = (Q * B_d)^T = B_d^T * Q^T = (C^T)^T * Q^T = C * Q^T`\nOur main task is to find this transformation matrix `Q`.\n\n**2. Define the Dual System**\nFirst, we compute the matrices for the dual system S2.\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n`B_d` has two columns, which we will call `b_d1` and `b_d2`:\n`b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]^T`\n`b_d2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`\n\n**3. Determine the Controllability Indices of the Dual System**\nThe transformation matrix `Q` depends on the controllability indices of the dual system (A_d, B_d). To find these, we must find `n=3` linearly independent (LI) vectors by searching the columns of the controllability matrix `W_c = [B_d, A_d*B_d, A_d^2*B_d, ...]` in a specific order.\n\nThe search order is: `b_d1, b_d2, A_d*b_d1, A_d*b_d2, ...`\n*   `v1 = b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]^T`. This is our first LI vector.\n*   `v2 = b_d2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`. This is LI with respect to `v1`.\n*   `A_d*b_d1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T`.\n    Let's check if this is LI with respect to `{v1, v2}`. The matrix `[v1, v2, A_d*b_d1] = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]` has a determinant of `-1 * (1*1 - 1*0) = -1 â‰  0`. So, it is LI.\n*   We have found 3 LI vectors, so we can stop.\n\nThe controllability indices `u_i` are the number of vectors selected from each chain `A_d^k * b_{di}`.\n*   From the chain of `b_d1`, we selected `b_d1` and `A_d*b_d1`. So, the index `u1 = 2`.\n*   From the chain of `b_d2`, we selected `b_d2`. So, the index `u2 = 1`.\n*   The indices are {u1, u2} = {2, 1}. The sum is 2+1=3=n, which is correct.\n\n**4. Construct the Transformation Matrix Q**\nThe transformation matrix `Q` for the controller canonical form is constructed as follows. Its inverse, `Q^(-1)`, is formed by arranging the selected LI vectors into chains.\n`Q^(-1) = M = [b_d1, A_d*b_d1, b_d2]`\n`M = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\nNow, we find `Q` by inverting `M`.\n`det(M) = 0 - 2*(1*0 - 1*0) + 1*(1*1 - 1*0) = 1`\nThe adjugate matrix is `adj(M) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, -2, 0]]^T`... A previous check gives the cofactor matrix as `[[-1,0,1],[1,0,0],[1,1,-2]]`. Let's recompute it.\nCofactor(1,1) = -1. Cofactor(1,2) = 0. Cofactor(1,3) = 1.\nCofactor(2,1) = 1. Cofactor(2,2) = 0. Cofactor(2,3) = 0.\nCofactor(3,1) = 1. Cofactor(3,2) = 1. Cofactor(3,3) = -2.\nAdjugate = Transpose of Cofactor Matrix = `[[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n`Q = M^(-1) = (1/det(M)) * adj(M) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n\n**5. Calculate the New Output Matrix C_o**\nWe use the formula derived in Step 1: `C_o = C * Q^T`.\nFirst, find `Q^T`:\n`Q^T = [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]`\n\nNow, perform the matrix multiplication:\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]`\n\n`C_o_11 = 0*(-1) + 1*1 + 0*1 = 1`\n`C_o_12 = 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*1 = 0`\n`C_o_13 = 0*1 + 1*0 + 0*(-2) = 0`\n`C_o_21 = 1*(-1) + 1*1 + 0*1 = 0`\n`C_o_22 = 1*0 + 1*0 + 0*1 = 0`\n`C_o_23 = 1*1 + 1*0 + 0*(-2) = 1`\n\nSo, the new output matrix is:\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n**Final Check (Structural Method)**\nThe structure of `C_o` in observer canonical form is defined by the observability indices `{v1, v2}` of the original system, which are identical to the controllability indices `{u1, u2}` of the dual system. So, `{v1, v2} = {2, 1}`.\nFor a system with observability indices `v_i`, the `j`-th row of `C_o` is a row vector with a 1 at position `k = 1 + v_1 + ... + v_{j-1}` and zeros elsewhere.\n*   For the first output (`j=1`), `k = 1`. The first row is `[1, 0, 0]`.\n*   For the second output (`j=2`), `k = 1 + v_1 = 1 + 2 = 3`. The second row is `[0, 0, 1]`.\nThis confirms our calculated result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe new matrix `C` (i.e., `C_o`) in the observer canonical form is:\n`[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
