    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct gene to knock out.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to stop the degradation of p-coumaric acid in an engineered strain of *Corynebacterium glutamicum*. This means we need to identify the native metabolic pathway in *C. glutamicum* that breaks down p-coumaric acid and block it.\n\n2.  **Identify the Degradation Pathway:** *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, like many soil bacteria, can use various aromatic compounds as carbon and energy sources. p-Coumaric acid is one such compound. The degradation process is called catabolism. We need to find the first enzymatic step in the catabolic pathway of p-coumaric acid. Blocking the first step is the most efficient way to prevent the loss of the starting compound.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the Initial Catabolic Reaction:** The degradation of p-coumaric acid in *C. glutamicum* and other related bacteria is initiated by a non-oxidative decarboxylation reaction. An enzyme removes the carboxyl group (-COOH) from the side chain of p-coumaric acid.\n\n    *   **Substrate:** p-Coumaric acid (4-hydroxycinnamic acid)\n    *   **Reaction:** Decarboxylation\n    *   **Product of Reaction:** 4-Vinylphenol + COâ‚‚\n\n4.  **Identify the Responsible Enzyme:** The enzyme that catalyzes this specific reaction is called **phenolic acid decarboxylase** (PAD) or, more specifically in this context, **p-coumarate decarboxylase**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Encoding Gene:** We now need to find the gene that codes for this p-coumarate decarboxylase enzyme in the *Corynebacterium glutamicum* genome. Research and genomic studies of *C. glutamicum* have identified this gene. It is commonly designated as **`pcuC`**.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Engineering Strategy:** To prevent the conversion of the desired p-coumaric acid into 4-vinylphenol, the `pcuC` gene must be rendered non-functional. The most common and effective method to achieve this in metabolic engineering is a gene knockout, which involves deleting the gene from the chromosome or disrupting it so it can no longer produce a functional enzyme.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Targeting the First Step:** It is crucial to target the very first enzyme that acts on p-coumaric acid. If we were to knock out a gene further downstream in the pathway (e.g., a gene involved in degrading 4-vinylphenol), p-coumaric acid would still be degraded, and an intermediate (4-vinylphenol) would accumulate instead, which is not the desired outcome.\n*   **Host Specificity:** The gene names can vary between organisms. While the enzyme function (phenolic acid decarboxylase) is common, the gene is known as `padC` in some bacteria and `pcuC` in *C. glutamicum*. The question specifically asks about *C. glutamicum*, so `pcuC` is the precise answer.\n*   **Verification:** This strategy has been experimentally validated in scientific literature. Studies have shown that deleting the `pcuC` gene in *C. glutamicum* successfully blocks p-coumaric acid degradation and leads to its accumulation when biosynthetic genes are present.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe degradation of p-coumaric acid is initiated by the enzyme p-coumarate decarboxylase, which is encoded by the `pcuC` gene in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*. Knocking out the `pcuC` gene will block this degradation pathway at its first step, allowing the desired product, p-coumaric acid, to accumulate in the cell.\n\n<<<pcuC>>>"
