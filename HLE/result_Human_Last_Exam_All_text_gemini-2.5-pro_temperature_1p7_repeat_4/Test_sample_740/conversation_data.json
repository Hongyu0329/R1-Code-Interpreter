    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the integral equation into a system of linear equations.**\n\nThe given integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`\n\nFirst, we simplify the kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can write:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\n\nThe kernel is a \"separable\" or \"degenerate\" kernel, as it's a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and functions of `y`. Let `f_k(x) = x^(n-1-k)` and `g_k(y) = y^k`.\nThe equation becomes:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k) u(y) dy`\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\n\nLet's define the moments `c_k` as the constants given by the integrals:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nNow the expression for `u(x)` is a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`\n\nTo find the constants `c_j`, we substitute this expression for `u(y)` back into the definition of `c_j`:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)) dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^j y^(n-1-k) dy`\n`c_j = [y^(j+1)/(j+1)]₀¹ + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k [y^(j+n-k)/(j+n-k)]₀¹`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)`\n\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)`. We can write this in matrix form as:\n`(I - λA)c = b`\nwhere:\n*   `c` is the column vector `[c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)]^T`.\n*   `b` is the column vector `[1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]^T`.\n*   `A` is the `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1 / (j + n - k)`, where `j` is the row index and `k` is the column index, both running from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n**Step 2: State the condition for no solution.**\n\nAccording to the theory of linear algebra (Fredholm alternative), the system `(I - λA)c = b` has no solution if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  The matrix `(I - λA)` is singular, i.e., `det(I - λA) = 0`. This means `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. In the context of integral equations, such `λ` are called characteristic values.\n2.  The vector `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`. This is equivalent to `b` not being orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix `(I - λA)^T`. That is, there must exist a vector `z` such that `(I - λA^T)z = 0` and `b^T z ≠ 0`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the orthogonality condition.**\n\nLet `L` be the integral operator `Lu(x) = ∫₀¹ K(x,y)u(y)dy`. The kernel `K(x,y) = (xⁿ-yⁿ)/(x-y)` is symmetric since `K(y,x) = (yⁿ-xⁿ)/(y-x) = K(x,y)`. An operator with a symmetric kernel is self-adjoint (`L=L*`).\n\nThe homogeneous adjoint equation `(I - λA^T)z = 0` corresponds to the eigenvalue problem for the adjoint operator `L*`. A non-zero solution `z` exists if `λ` is a characteristic value. The components `z_k` of the vector `z` are the coefficients of an eigenfunction `v(x)` of the adjoint operator, `v(x) = ∑ z_k x^k`.\n\nSince the operator `L` is self-adjoint, the eigenfunctions `v(x)` of the adjoint operator are the same as the eigenfunctions of the original operator `L`. So, for a characteristic value `λ`, there exists a non-trivial function `v(x)` such that `v(x) = λ L v(x)`.\n\nThe orthogonality condition `b^T z ≠ 0` can be written as:\n`b^T z = ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) b_j z_j = ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) (1/(j+1)) z_j`\nThis sum is equivalent to the integral of the eigenfunction `v(x) = ∑ z_j x^j`:\n`∫₀¹ v(x) dx = ∫₀¹ (∑_(j=0)^(n-1) z_j x^j) dx = ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) z_j / (j+1)`\nSo, the condition for the equation to have no solution (given that `λ` is a characteristic value) is that there must exist a corresponding eigenfunction `v(x)` such that `∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0`.\n\n**Step 4: Prove that the orthogonality condition is always met.**\n\nWe need to show that for any characteristic value `λ`, there is always at least one eigenfunction `v(x)` whose integral is non-zero.\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that for a certain characteristic value `λ`, all corresponding eigenfunctions `v(x)` have an integral of zero.\n`∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0` for all `v` in the eigenspace `V_λ`.\n\nThis means that the entire eigenspace `V_λ` is orthogonal to the constant function `P_0(x) = 1`. In other words, `V_λ` is a subspace of the space of functions on `[0,1]` that are orthogonal to `P_0(x)`. Let's call this subspace `P_0^⊥`.\n\nIf `V_λ` is a subspace of `P_0^⊥`, it means `P_0^⊥` is an invariant subspace of the operator `L`. Since `L` is self-adjoint, its orthogonal complement, `(P_0^⊥)^⊥ = span{P_0}`, must also be an invariant subspace. This would imply that `L(P_0)` is a multiple of `P_0`. In other words, the constant function `v(x)=1` must be an eigenfunction of `L`.\n\nLet's check if `v(x)=1` can be an eigenfunction:\n`1 = λ ∫₀¹ K(x,y) * 1 dy = λ ∫₀¹ (xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + yⁿ⁻¹) dy`\n`1 = λ [xⁿ⁻¹y + xⁿ⁻²y²/2 + ... + yⁿ/n]_₀¹`\n`1 = λ (xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²/2 + ... + 1/n)`\n\nFor this equality to hold for all `x` in `[0,1]`, the right side must be constant. This only happens if all terms with `x` vanish, which requires `n-1=0`, so `n=1`.\n*   For `n=1`, the equation becomes `1 = λ(1)`, so `λ=1`. The eigenfunction is `v(x)=1`, and its integral is `∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1 ≠ 0`. So the condition holds.\n*   For `n>1`, the right side is a non-constant polynomial in `x`. The equality cannot hold. Thus, for `n>1`, `v(x)=1` is not an eigenfunction.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction. The assumption that `P_0^⊥` is an invariant subspace is false for `n>1`. Therefore, no eigenspace `V_λ` can be entirely contained within `P_0^⊥`. This means that for any characteristic `λ`, there must be an eigenfunction `v(x)` that is not orthogonal to `P_0`, i.e., `∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n\nWe have shown that for any characteristic value `λ`, the condition `b^T z ≠ 0` is always satisfied. This means that if `det(I - λA) = 0`, the system of equations is always inconsistent, and there is no solution for `u(x)`.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solution if and only if `λ` is a characteristic value of the integral operator `L`. This is equivalent to `1/λ` being an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are those for which `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the `n x n` matrix `A` with entries `A_jk = 1 / (j + n - k)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\n<<<The values of λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A whose elements are given by A_jk = 1/(j + n - k), where j and k are the row and column indices ranging from 0 to n-1.>>>"
