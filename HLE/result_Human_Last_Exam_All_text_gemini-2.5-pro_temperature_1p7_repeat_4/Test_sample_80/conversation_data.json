    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of empty edge squares.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Edge Squares and Their Properties**\n\n*   A standard 8x8 chessboard has a perimeter consisting of all the squares in the 1st rank, 8th rank, 'a' file, and 'h' file.\n*   Let's count these squares:\n    *   Rank 1 has 8 squares.\n    *   Rank 8 has 8 squares.\n    *   File 'a' has 8 squares, but the two corner squares (a1, a8) have already been counted in the ranks. So, there are 6 new squares.\n    *   File 'h' has 8 squares, but its corners (h1, h8) have also been counted. So, there are 6 new squares.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = **28 squares**.\n*   On a chessboard, squares alternate in color. The 28 edge squares are perfectly balanced, consisting of **14 dark squares** and **14 light squares**.\n\n**2. Understand the Game's Constraint**\n\n*   The goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 squares.\n*   The main rule is that no bishop can attack another. A bishop attacks along diagonals.\n*   A crucial point about bishops is that they always stay on squares of the color they start on. A light-squared bishop can never attack a dark-squared bishop, and vice-versa.\n*   This means we can solve the problem for the 14 dark squares and the 14 light squares independently and then add the results.\n\n**3. Maximize Bishops on Dark Edge Squares**\n\nLet's find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 dark edge squares. We can group the squares by the diagonals they share with other dark edge squares.\n\n*   The squares `a1` and `h8` are on the same long diagonal. We can only place one bishop between them. (Max: 1 bishop)\n*   The squares `{c1, a3, f8, h6}` form a connected group. A bishop on any one of these squares can attack at least one other in the set. After analysis, we can place a maximum of two non-attacking bishops in this group of four (e.g., on `c1` and `f8`). (Max: 2 bishops)\n*   The squares `{e1, a5, d8, h4}` form a similar connected group of four. We can again place a maximum of two non-attacking bishops here (e.g., on `e1` and `d8`). (Max: 2 bishops)\n*   The squares `{g1, a7, b8, h2}` form the final connected group of four. We can place a maximum of two bishops here as well (e.g., on `g1` and `b8`). (Max: 2 bishops)\n\nAdding the maximums from each group: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **7 bishops** on dark squares.\n\n**4. Maximize Bishops on Light Edge Squares**\n\nDue to the symmetry of the chessboard, the problem for the 14 light edge squares is identical in structure to the problem for the dark squares. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 light edge squares is also **7 bishops**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Placed Bishops**\n\n*   Maximum bishops on dark squares = 7\n*   Maximum bishops on light squares = 7\n*   Total maximum bishops that can be placed on the edge = 7 + 7 = **14 bishops**.\n\n**6. Determine the Number of Empty Edge Squares**\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops if the players succeeded in placing the maximum number possible.\n\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Maximum placed bishops = 14\n*   Edge squares lacking bishops = Total edge squares - Placed bishops\n*   Edge squares lacking bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correctly Counting Edge Squares:** Ensure you don't double-count the four corner squares. The total is 28, not 32.\n2.  **Using Color Separation:** The fact that bishops on different colors don't interact is the key to simplifying the problem into two smaller, identical problems.\n3.  **Maximization, not just Placement:** The goal is the absolute maximum number of bishops. This requires checking that no more bishops can be added to the proposed set.\n4.  **Final Question:** The question asks for the empty squares, not the filled ones. The final step is to subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBy placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, 14 bishops would be on the edge. Since there are 28 edge squares in total, the number of squares lacking a bishop would be 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
