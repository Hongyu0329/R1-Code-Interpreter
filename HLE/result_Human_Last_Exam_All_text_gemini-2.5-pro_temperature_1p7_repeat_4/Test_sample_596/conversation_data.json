    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests (F,R)\" on a \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\" that \"fail to have the forest F simplicially collapse onto the root R\".\n\n1.  **Möbius band**: This is a well-known topological space, a surface with one side and one boundary. It is a 2-dimensional manifold with boundary. Topologically, it is non-orientable and has the homotopy type of a circle ($S^1$).\n2.  **Standard triangulation**: The specific choice of triangulation of the Möbius band does not affect the final answer, as the quantity being counted is a topological invariant. Any valid triangulation will yield the same result. We will denote the simplicial complex corresponding to this triangulation as $K$. The dimension of $K$ is 2.\n3.  **Higher dimensional rooted forests (F,R)**: This terminology is specific to certain fields of algebraic combinatorics, particularly those related to generalizations of the matrix-tree theorem and the chip-firing model (sandpile model) to simplicial complexes.\n    *   A \"forest\" in this context is a collection of simplices that is \"acyclic\" in some sense. \"Higher dimensional\" suggests we are interested in forests of edges (1-simplices) or faces (2-simplices).\n    *   The pair $(F, R)$ denotes the forest and its root. In these combinatorial models, the collection of such \"rooted forests\" often forms a group, and its size is related to the homology of the complex $K$.\n4.  **Failure of simplicial collapse**: A simplicial complex $A$ simplicially collapses onto a subcomplex $B$ if $A$ can be reduced to $B$ through a sequence of elementary collapses. A failure to collapse is strongly associated with the presence of torsion in the integral homology groups of the complex. The \"nice\" or \"collapsing\" forests correspond to the identity element in the associated group structure, while the \"non-collapsing\" or \"failing\" ones correspond to the non-identity elements.\n\n### Step 2: Connecting the Concepts to a Computable Quantity\nThe question combines concepts from topology (Möbius band, homology), combinatorial topology (simplicial collapse), and algebraic combinatorics (rooted forests). The number requested must be a topological invariant. The language strongly points to theories generalizing the sandpile group of a graph.\n\nFor a $d$-dimensional simplicial complex $K$ with boundary $\\partial K$, there are combinatorial objects (variously called cellular spanning trees, recurrent configurations of the chip-firing game, or related concepts like rooted forests) whose number is given by the order of a torsion subgroup of a homology group of $K$.\n\nThe key insight is that the set of these \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" is in bijection with the elements of a specific finite abelian group, the *simplicial sandpile group* or *critical group*. The \"collapsing\" forest corresponds to the identity element of this group. Therefore, the number of forests that \"fail to collapse\" is the total number of forests minus one.\n\nThe relevant group for a $d$-dimensional complex $K$ with boundary $\\partial K$ is the torsion subgroup of the relative homology group $H_{d-1}(K, \\partial K; \\mathbb{Z})$.\nSo, the number of \"failing\" forests is $|H_{d-1}(K, \\partial K; \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}}| - 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation for the Möbius Band\nWe apply this formula to the Möbius band, which we denote by $M$.\n1.  **Dimension**: The Möbius band is a 2-dimensional complex, so $d=2$. The formula becomes $|H_{2-1}(M, \\partial M; \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}}| - 1 = |H_1(M, \\partial M; \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}}| - 1$.\n2.  **Homology of the Möbius Band and its Boundary**:\n    *   The Möbius band $M$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle $S^1$. Its integral homology groups are $H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_k(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n    *   The boundary of the Möbius band, $\\partial M$, is a single circle, also homeomorphic to $S^1$. Its homology groups are $H_0(\\partial M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(\\partial M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_k(\\partial M; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n3.  **Relative Homology Calculation**: We use the long exact sequence for the pair $(M, \\partial M)$:\n    $\\cdots \\to H_2(M) \\to H_2(M, \\partial M) \\to H_1(\\partial M) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_1(M) \\to H_1(M, \\partial M) \\to H_0(\\partial M) \\to H_0(M) \\to \\cdots$\n\n    Plugging in the known groups:\n    $\\cdots \\to 0 \\to H_2(M, \\partial M) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(M, \\partial M) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\cdots$\n\n4.  **Analyzing the map $i_***$: The map $i_*: H_1(\\partial M) \\to H_1(M)$ is induced by the inclusion map $i: \\partial M \\hookrightarrow M$. The boundary circle $\\partial M$ wraps around the core circle of the Möbius band twice. Therefore, the induced map on the first homology group sends the generator of $H_1(\\partial M)$ to twice the generator of $H_1(M)$. So, $i_*$ is multiplication by 2.\n\n5.  **Finishing the Calculation**: The exact sequence gives us the segment:\n    $\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 2} \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(M, \\partial M) \\to 0$\n    (The map $H_1(M, \\partial M) \\to \\tilde{H}_0(\\partial M)=0$ must be the zero map).\n    From exactness at the middle $\\mathbb{Z}$, the image of the map $\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 2} \\mathbb{Z}$ is the kernel of the map $\\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(M, \\partial M)$. This means we have the following short exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to \\text{coker}(\\times 2) \\to H_1(M, \\partial M) \\to 0$.\n    Thus, $H_1(M, \\partial M)$ is isomorphic to the cokernel of the multiplication-by-2 map.\n    $H_1(M, \\partial M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} / \\text{im}(\\times 2) = \\mathbb{Z} / 2\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n6.  **Finding the Torsion**: The group $H_1(M, \\partial M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, which is a torsion group. Its torsion subgroup is the entire group. So, $H_1(M, \\partial M; \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nThe number of higher dimensional rooted forests that fail to collapse is given by:\n$|H_1(M, \\partial M; \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}}| - 1 = |\\mathbb{Z}_2| - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\nThere is exactly one such non-collapsing object."
