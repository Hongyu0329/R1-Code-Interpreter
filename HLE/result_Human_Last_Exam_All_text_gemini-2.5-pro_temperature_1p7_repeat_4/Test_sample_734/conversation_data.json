    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A Christian theologian.\n    *   **Key Action:** Developed specialized terminology. This implies the coining or specific application of terms, not just a general discussion of the topic.\n    *   **The Terminology's Purpose:** To describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n    *   **Specific Applications (Test Cases):** The terminology must be applicable to two distinct scenarios:\n        1.  **The virgin birth of Jesus:** A specific, singular miracle that supersedes the normal laws of biology.\n        2.  **Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall:** A systemic, foundational change in the created order resulting from Adam's sin, affecting nature itself (e.g., introducing death, disease, and futility as described in Genesis 3 and Romans 8).\n    *   **Implicit Condition:** The question seeks the theologian who *first* did this, as historical precedence is important in theology.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming of Candidates:**\n    *   **Early Church Fathers:** Augustine, Irenaeus, Origen.\n    *   **Medieval Scholastics:** Anselm, Thomas Aquinas.\n    *   **Reformers:** Martin Luther, John Calvin.\n    *   Given the foundational nature of the question, the most likely candidates are from the Patristic (Early Church) or Scholastic (Medieval) periods.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Candidates:**\n\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–1274):** Aquinas is a strong candidate. He developed the highly influential distinction between God's **absolute power** (*potentia absoluta*) and God's **ordained power** (*potentia ordinata*).\n        *   *Potentia Ordinata*: Refers to how God chooses to work through the consistent and observable laws of nature that He established.\n        *   *Potentia Absoluta*: Refers to God's sheer ability to do anything that is not logically contradictory, including acting outside of the natural order He ordained.\n        *   *Application:* The virgin birth would be an act of God's *potentia absoluta*. The changes at the Fall could be described as God re-ordaining the natural order, shifting from one ordained state (paradise) to another (fallen world). While this terminology works, it describes God's power *relative* to the laws, rather than the intrinsic mechanism of change *within* nature itself.\n\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** Augustine predates Aquinas by over 800 years and is arguably the most influential Western theologian after the Apostle Paul. When writing about creation, miracles, and Genesis (especially in his work *De Genesi ad Litteram* - \"The Literal Meaning of Genesis\"), he faced this exact problem.\n        *   **Developed Specialized Terminology:** To solve this, Augustine developed the concept of ***rationes seminales***, or **\"seminal reasons\"** (sometimes translated as \"causal reasons\" or \"seed principles\").\n        *   **How it Works:** Augustine argued that at the initial moment of creation, God did not create everything in its final, mature form. Instead, He embedded within matter all the potentialities or \"seeds\" for everything that would ever come into being, both through normal development and through extraordinary acts.\n        *   **The \"Laws of Nature\":** For Augustine, the regular, observable course of nature is simply the normal unfolding of these seminal reasons over time, according to the order God established.\n        *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** A miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature as God originally created it. Instead, it is God directly activating a *ratio seminalis* that was embedded in creation from the beginning but lies outside the *usual* chain of cause and effect. It is extraordinary, but not \"unnatural\" from the perspective of God's total creative plan.\n        *   **Application to the Fall:** The changes in nature after the Fall can also be explained by this concept. The seminal reasons for death, decay, thorns, and thistles were present as potentialities from the beginning. After the sin of Adam, God allowed or caused these negative potentialities to become part of the new, corrupted, regular order of nature. This constitutes a fundamental \"alteration in natural law.\"\n\n4.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    *   Both Aquinas and Augustine provided frameworks. However, Augustine was *first*.\n    *   Furthermore, Augustine's terminology of ***rationes seminales*** is specifically designed to describe how new or different things can emerge from within the created order itself, guided by God's will. This fits the wording \"changes in the laws of nature\" more directly than Aquinas's terminology, which focuses more on God's power acting upon the established order. Augustine's concept provides a mechanism *within* creation for these changes to occur, applicable to both singular miracles and systemic shifts.\n\n***\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
