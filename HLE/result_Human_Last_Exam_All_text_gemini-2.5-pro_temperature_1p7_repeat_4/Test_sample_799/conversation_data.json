    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set of real numbers `A` is called a Sidon set (or a B₂-set) if for any four elements `a, b, c, d` in `A`, the equation `a + b = c + d` implies that the pair of elements `{a, b}` is the same as `{c, d}` (as multisets). This means either (`a=c` and `b=d`) or (`a=d` and `b=c`). A key consequence is that all pairwise sums `a+b` with `a, b ∈ A` and `a ≤ b` are unique.\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted `dim_H(S)`, is a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension of a set `S`. It can be a non-integer. For a set contained in `[0, 1]`, its Hausdorff dimension is a number between 0 and 1. For example, `dim_H({a single point}) = 0`, while `dim_H([0, 1]) = 1`.\n\nThe question asks for the supremum of `dim_H(A)` over all sets `A ⊆ [0, 1]` that are Sidon sets.\n\n**Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for the Dimension**\n\nTo find the maximum possible dimension, we first establish an upper limit that no Sidon set can exceed.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Sidon sets and Arithmetic Progressions.**\n    A three-term arithmetic progression is a set of the form `{x, x+d, x+2d}` where `d ≠ 0`. Let's see if a Sidon set can contain such a progression. Let `a = x`, `b = x+2d`, `c = x+d`, and `d' = x+d`. All four elements are in the set.\n    We can form the sum `a + b = x + (x+2d) = 2x + 2d`.\n    We can also form the sum `c + d' = (x+d) + (x+d) = 2x + 2d`.\n    So, we have `a + b = c + d'`.\n    According to the Sidon property, this must imply `{a, b} = {c, d'}`. This means `{x, x+2d} = {x+d, x+d}`. This is only possible if `x = x+d` and `x+2d = x+d`, which requires `d=0`. But a non-trivial arithmetic progression requires `d ≠ 0`.\n    **Conclusion:** A Sidon set cannot contain a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Hausdorff Dimension and Arithmetic Progressions.**\n    There is a profound result in fractal geometry, which is a generalization of Roth's theorem. It connects the Hausdorff dimension of a set to its arithmetic structure. The theorem states:\n    *Any Borel set `S ⊆ ℝ` with `dim_H(S) > 1/2` must contain a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression.*\n\n*   **Combining the points to find the upper bound:**\n    1.  Let `A` be any Sidon set in `[0, 1]`.\n    2.  From Point 1, we know `A` cannot contain a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression.\n    3.  From Point 2, if the dimension of `A` were greater than 1/2, it *would have to* contain a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression.\n    4.  The only way to resolve this is to conclude that the dimension of `A` cannot be greater than 1/2.\n    Therefore, for any Sidon set `A`, we must have `dim_H(A) ≤ 1/2`. This establishes `1/2` as an upper bound for the maximum possible dimension.\n\n**Step 3: Show that the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nNow, we need to show that this upper bound of `1/2` can actually be reached. We do this by constructing a specific set `A ⊆ [0, 1]` which is a Sidon set and has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly `1/2`.\n\n*   **Construction:**\n    Consider the set `A` of all numbers in `[0, 1]` that can be written in base 4 using only the digits 0 and 1.\n    `A = { Σ_{k=1}^∞ d_k * 4^{-k} | d_k ∈ {0, 1} }`\n    For example, `1/4 = 0.1_4`, `1/3 = Σ (1*4^{-k}) = 0.111..._4`, and `1/16 = 0.01_4` are all in `A`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Calculating the Dimension of this Set.**\n    This set `A` is a classic self-similar fractal, much like the Cantor set. It can be constructed by starting with `[0, 1/3]`, scaling it by a factor of 1/4 into two copies, `[0, 1/12]` and `[1/4, 1/3]`, and iterating. The Hausdorff dimension of such a set is given by the formula `d = log(N) / log(s)`, where `N` is the number of smaller copies and `s` is the scaling factor. Here, we create `N=2` copies (one for digit 0, one for digit 1) at each step, and the scaling factor is `s=4` (since we are in base 4).\n    `dim_H(A) = log(2) / log(4) = log(2) / (2 * log(2)) = 1/2.`\n    So, we have constructed a set `A ⊆ [0, 1]` with `dim_H(A) = 1/2`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Proving the Constructed Set is a Sidon Set.**\n    Let `a, b, c, d` be any four numbers from our set `A`. Let their base 4 expansions be:\n    `a = Σ a_k 4^{-k}`, `b = Σ b_k 4^{-k}`, `c = Σ c_k 4^{-k}`, `d = Σ d_k 4^{-k}`\n    where all the digits `a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k` are in `{0, 1}`.\n    Assume `a + b = c + d`.\n    `Σ (a_k + b_k) * 4^{-k} = Σ (c_k + d_k) * 4^{-k}`\n    The sums of the digits, `a_k + b_k` and `c_k + d_k`, can only take values in `{0, 1, 2}`.\n    A fundamental property of number bases is the uniqueness of expansion. Since the \"digits\" `(a_k+b_k)` and `(c_k+d_k)` are all less than the base 4, this expansion is unique. Therefore, we must have `a_k + b_k = c_k + d_k` for every `k`.\n    Now we inspect this equation for digits in `{0, 1}`:\n    *   If `a_k + b_k = 0`, then necessarily `a_k=0` and `b_k=0`.\n    *   If `a_k + b_k = 1`, then necessarily `{a_k, b_k} = {0, 1}`.\n    *   If `a_k + b_k = 2`, then necessarily `a_k=1` and `b_k=1`.\n    In every case, the value of the sum uniquely determines the multiset of digits `{a_k, b_k}`. So, `a_k + b_k = c_k + d_k` implies `{a_k, b_k} = {c_k, d_k}` for all `k`.\n    This implies that the sequence of pairs `({a_1, b_1}, {a_2, b_2}, ...)` is just a reordering of the sequence `({c_1, d_1}, {c_2, d_2}, ...)`. This directly leads to the conclusion that `{a, b} = {c, d}`. Thus, the set `A` is a Sidon set.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that any Sidon set in `[0, 1]` must have a Hausdorff dimension of at most `1/2`. We have also constructed a specific Sidon set in `[0, 1]` that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly `1/2`. Therefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is `1/2`.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
