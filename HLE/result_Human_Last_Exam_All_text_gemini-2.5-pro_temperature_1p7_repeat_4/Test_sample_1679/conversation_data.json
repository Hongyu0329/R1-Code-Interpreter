    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their Locations**\n\nThe question refers to a \"Luxor Obelisk.\" Originally a pair, these ancient Egyptian obelisks were carved to stand at the entrance of the Luxor Temple. Today, they are in two different locations:\n1.  One obelisk remains in its original location at the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n2.  The second obelisk was gifted to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\n\nTherefore, the film in question could be set in either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris, France.\n\n### **Step 2: Create a Chronological List of Best Picture Winners and Analyze their Settings**\n\nWe must examine the Best Picture Oscar winners chronologically, starting from the first ceremony, and check their settings for a possible depiction of either obelisk.\n\n*   **1st-20th Academy Awards (1928-1947):** Winners from this period include *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *It Happened One Night*, *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, and *Casablanca*.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must scrutinize any film set in Paris. *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set in Paris, but it's a biographical drama focused heavily on interiors like courtrooms and offices, with no prominent scenes featuring major outdoor landmarks like the Place de la Concorde. *Casablanca* (1943) famously features a flashback to Paris and an opening montage of refugee routes, showing the Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower, but it does not include a shot of the Place de la Concorde or its obelisk. Other films in this period are set in America, England, Germany, or on the high seas, far from either Luxor or Paris.\n\n*   **21st Academy Awards (1948) - *Hamlet*:** Set in Denmark. No obelisk.\n*   **22nd Academy Awards (1949) - *All the King's Men*:** Set in the American South. No obelisk.\n*   **23rd Academy Awards (1950) - *All About Eve*:** Set in New York City and Connecticut. No obelisk.\n\n### **Step 3: Pinpoint the First Film Featuring the Obelisk**\n\n*   **24th Academy Awards (1951) - *An American in Paris***:\n    *   **Analysis:** This film is set entirely in Paris and is a celebration of the city's art and beauty. It is a very strong candidate. The film concludes with a famous 17-minute ballet sequence that visually interprets the music of George Gershwin through the styles of various French painters.\n    *   **Careful Point:** During the segment inspired by the painter Raoul Dufy, the scenery transforms into a stylized, colorful vision of the Place de la Concorde. The Luxor Obelisk is prominently featured in the center of the square, along with its surrounding fountains.\n    *   **Conclusion:** *An American in Paris* clearly depicts the Luxor Obelisk in Paris. As no prior Best Picture winner has been identified as showing either obelisk, this is very likely the first.\n\n### **Step 4: Verify No Other Earlier Film Meets the Criteria and Check Later Films for Context**\n\nTo confirm *An American in Paris* is the first, we should consider later films to ensure our timeline is correct.\n*   ***Around the World in 80 Days*** **(Winner for 1956):** This film features a sequence where the characters travel through Paris, and it includes live-action shots of the Place de la Concorde and the Obelisk. However, its win in 1956 comes five years after *An American in Paris*.\n*   ***Gigi*** **(Winner for 1958):** Also set in Paris, this film features numerous on-location scenes that include the Obelisk. Its win is even later.\n*   **Films set in Egypt:** No film set in ancient or modern Egypt won the Best Picture award before or during this period. Epic films like *The Ten Commandments* (1956), which depicts ancient Egyptian obelisks, were nominated but did not win Best Picture.\n\nBased on a chronological review, *An American in Paris* is the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
