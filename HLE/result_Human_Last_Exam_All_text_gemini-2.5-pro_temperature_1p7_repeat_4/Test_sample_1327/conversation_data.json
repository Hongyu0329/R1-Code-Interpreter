    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and look for simple patterns.**\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's find the difference between consecutive terms (the first difference).\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. This is not a simple arithmetic progression.\n\nLet's check the ratio between consecutive terms.\n*   11 / 2 = 5.5\n*   23 / 11 â‰ˆ 2.09\nThe ratios are not constant, so it's not a simple geometric progression.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a more complex pattern, such as a recurrence relation.**\nA common pattern in these puzzles is `a(n+1) = k * a(n) + c`, where `k` is a constant multiplier and `c` might change. Let's try `k=2`, as the numbers are roughly doubling.\n*   From 2 to 11:  `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`\n*   From 11 to 23: `2 * 11 + 1 = 23`\n*   From 23 to 51: `2 * 23 + 5 = 46 + 5 = 51`\n*   From 51 to 119: `2 * 51 + 17 = 102 + 17 = 119`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the emerging pattern.**\nThe rule appears to be `a(n+1) = 2 * a(n) + (a changing number)`. Let's look at the sequence of the numbers that are added.\nThe added numbers are {7, 1, 5, 17}. This sequence does not seem to have a clear pattern.\n\n**Careful Point:** Often in such puzzles, the first term is a \"seed\" and the main pattern starts from the second term. Let's re-evaluate the pattern ignoring the first calculation (from 2 to 11).\n\nThe pattern starting from the second term (11) is:\n*   `a(3) = 2 * a(2) + 1`  (23 = 2 * 11 + 1)\n*   `a(4) = 2 * a(3) + 5`  (51 = 2 * 23 + 5)\n*   `a(5) = 2 * a(4) + 17` (119 = 2 * 51 + 17)\n\nThis gives us a new sequence for the added numbers: **b = {1, 5, 17, ...}**. We need to find the next number in this sequence `b` to calculate the next term in the main sequence `a`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern for the sub-sequence 'b'.**\nThe sequence is b = {1, 5, 17}. Let's find the differences between its terms.\n*   5 - 1 = 4\n*   17 - 5 = 12\nThe differences are {4, 12}. We can see a clear pattern here: it is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 (12 = 4 * 3).\n\n**Step 5: Predict the next term in the sub-sequence 'b'.**\nTo find the next term in the differences {4, 12, ...}, we multiply the last term by 3:\n*   Next difference = 12 * 3 = 36\nNow, we add this difference to the last term of sequence 'b' to get the next term:\n*   Next term in 'b' = 17 + 36 = 53\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer.**\nWe now have all the information to find the number that should be in the parentheses. We use the rule `a(n+1) = 2 * a(n) + (next term in b)`.\n*   Next term = 2 * 119 + 53\n*   Next term = 238 + 53\n*   Next term = 291\n\nThe next number in the sequence is 291. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
