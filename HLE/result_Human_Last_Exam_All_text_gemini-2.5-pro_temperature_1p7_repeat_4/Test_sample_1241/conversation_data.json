    "This problem requires finding the steady-state probabilities of a system described by a set of differential equations. This is a typical continuous-time Markov chain problem.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question and careful points\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem presents a Kolmogorov-Chapman system of four linear differential equations for probabilities $P_0(t), P_1(t), P_2(t), P_3(t)$ and a normalization condition $\\sum_{i=0}^3 P_i(t) = 1$. The goal is to find the limiting value of $P_0(t) + P_1(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$.\n\n2.  **Verify Consistency (A crucial point):** A fundamental property of a system with conserved total probability is that the sum of the time derivatives of the probabilities must be zero. Let's check this for the given system:\n    $P_0' = -\\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1$\n    $P_1' = -\\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\lambda_{21}P_2 + \\lambda_{31}P_3$\n    $P_2' = \\lambda_{12}P_1 - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_2$\n    $P_3' = \\lambda_{23}P_2 - \\lambda_{31}P_3$\n\n    Summing these four equations:\n    $\\sum P_i'(t) = P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3'$\n    The terms involving $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ cancel out:\n    *   $P_1$ terms: $\\lambda_{10} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + \\lambda_{12} = 0$\n    *   $P_2$ terms: $\\lambda_{21} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}) + \\lambda_{23} = 0$\n    *   $P_3$ terms: $\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31} = 0$\n    The terms involving $P_0$ are:\n    *   $P_0$ terms: $-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01} = -2\\lambda_{01}$\n\n    So, $\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. Since we are given $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$, its derivative with respect to time must be zero. This leads to $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) = 0$. As $\\lambda_{01}=0.019 \\neq 0$, it implies $P_0(t)=0$ for all $t$. If $P_0(t)=0$, the first equation gives $\\lambda_{10}P_1(t)=0$, which implies $P_1(t)=0$. Following this logic, all probabilities must be zero, which contradicts the condition $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$.\n\n3.  **Correct the System:** The inconsistency strongly suggests a typo in the problem statement. For a standard continuous-time Markov chain, a transition from state $i$ to state $j$ adds a positive term $\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ to the equation for $P_j'(t)$. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ in the equation for $P_1'(t)$ should represent the flow from state 0 to state 1 and should be positive. We assume the corrected equation is:\n    $P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$.\n    With this correction, $\\sum P_i'(t) = 0$, which is consistent with the normalization condition. The analysis will proceed with this corrected system.\n\n4.  **Find the Steady-State:** The values $P_i(+\\infty)$ are the steady-state (or stationary) probabilities, denoted as $\\pi_i$. These are found by setting the time derivatives to zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$.\n\n### Acquiring the final answer with step-by-step analysis\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the steady-state equations**\nUsing the corrected system and setting all derivatives to zero, we get a system of linear algebraic equations. Let $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$ (Normalization)\n\n**Step 2: Solve the system of equations**\nWe substitute the given rate constants:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\nFrom equation (1), we express $\\pi_0$ in terms of $\\pi_1$:\n$0.019\\pi_0 = 0.65\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$.\n\nFrom equation (3), we express $\\pi_2$ in terms of $\\pi_1$:\nFirst, calculate $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$.\nThe equation becomes $0 = 0.4\\pi_1 - 0.4\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_1$.\n\nFrom equation (4), we express $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_2$:\n$0 = 0.008\\pi_2 - 0.008\\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\pi_2$.\nSince $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, we have $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the normalization condition to find the individual probabilities**\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2,$ and $\\pi_3$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$\\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19}\\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$.\n\nNow we find $\\pi_0$:\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the required sum**\nThe question asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nThe fraction $\\frac{669}{707}$ cannot be simplified further. Its decimal value is approximately 0.94625.\n\n<<<669/707>>>"
