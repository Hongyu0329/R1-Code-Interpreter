    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Batting Triple Crown\nThe Triple Crown in baseball refers to a batter leading their league in three key statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average:** Hits divided by at-bats.\n2.  **Home Runs (HR):** The number of home runs hit.\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI):** The number of runs that score as a result of the batter's action.\n\n### Step 2: List the Winners by League\nTo find the total number of winners, we need to list every player who has achieved this feat in a recognized Major League (American League, National League, and other historical leagues like the American Association). A key point is to count each player only once, even if they won the Triple Crown multiple times.\n\n#### American League (AL) Winners:\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947) - *Careful Point: Williams won twice but is counted as one unique winner.*\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n**Total unique winners in the AL: 9**\n\n#### National League (NL) Winners:\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878) - *Careful Point: This is the earliest instance, and while some older statistics are debated, MLB recognizes Hines's achievement.*\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925) - *Careful Point: Hornsby also won twice but is counted as one unique winner.*\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n**Total unique winners in the NL: 5**\n\n#### Other Recognized Major League Winners (American Association):\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887) - *Careful Point: The American Association was considered a major league during its existence, so its winners are included in the MLB total.*\n**Total unique winners in the AA: 1**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Unique Winners\nThe question asks for the total number of winners, not the total number of times the Triple Crown has been won. Therefore, we sum the unique players from each list.\n\n*   American League Winners: 9\n*   National League Winners: 5\n*   American Association Winner: 1\n\nTotal Unique Winners = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15\n\n### Final Answer\nBy compiling the lists of all winners from recognized Major Leagues and counting each player only once, we arrive at the final number.\n\n<<<15>>>"
