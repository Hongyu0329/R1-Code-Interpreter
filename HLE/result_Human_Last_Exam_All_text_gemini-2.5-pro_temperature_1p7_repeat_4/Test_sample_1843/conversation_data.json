    "Answering the question step-by-step:\nLet $\\chi$ be a Dirichlet character of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N.**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\nThe prime power factors are $q_1 = 4$, $q_2 = 9$, $q_3 = 7$, $q_4 = 11$, and $q_5 = 13$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the character.**\nAny Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo the prime power factors $q_i$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $q_i$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conditions for primitivity and order.**\n1.  **Primitivity**: A character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $q_i$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of the $\\chi_i$. Since we require the conductor of $\\chi$ to be $N = 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$, the conductor of each $\\chi_i$ must be exactly $q_i$.\n\n2.  **Order**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\n    We require this LCM to be 6.\n\nFor the LCM to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n*   The order of each $\\chi_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n*   At least one $\\chi_i$ must have an order divisible by 2 (i.e., 2 or 6).\n*   At least one $\\chi_j$ must have an order divisible by 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\n**Step 4: Count primitive characters for each prime power factor.**\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each $q_i$ with orders that are divisors of 6. Let $n(q,d)$ denote the number of primitive characters modulo $q$ of order $d$.\n\n*   **For $q_1 = 4 = 2^2$**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(4) = 2$. It has one principal character (conductor 1, order 1) and one non-principal character of order 2. This non-principal character is primitive.\n    - $n(4, 2) = 1$.\n    - No primitive characters of order 1, 3, or 6.\n\n*   **For $q_2 = 9 = 3^2$**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(9) = 6$. It is cyclic. The characters induced from modulo 3 are imprimitive (orders 1 and 2). The remaining characters are primitive.\n    - Total characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$. These are primitive. $n(9, 3) = 2$.\n    - Total characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$. These are primitive. $n(9, 6) = 2$.\n    - No primitive characters of order 1 or 2.\n\n*   **For $q_3 = 7$ (prime)**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(7) = 6$. It is cyclic. All non-principal characters are primitive.\n    - $n(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - $n(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - $n(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **For $q_4 = 11$ (prime)**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(11) = 10$. It is cyclic. All non-principal characters are primitive. The orders must divide 6.\n    - $n(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Orders 3 and 6 do not divide 10, so $n(11, 3) = 0$ and $n(11, 6) = 0$.\n\n*   **For $q_5 = 13$ (prime)**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(13) = 12$. It is cyclic. All non-principal characters are primitive. The orders must divide 6.\n    - $n(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - $n(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - $n(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results using Inclusion-Exclusion.**\nLet's find the number of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$ that satisfy the conditions. The total number of characters is the number of such tuples.\n\nWe will first count the total number of combinations of primitive characters where the order of each $\\chi_i$ divides 6.\n*   Choices for $\\chi_1$ (order must be 2): 1\n*   Choices for $\\chi_2$ (order can be 3 or 6): $n(9,3) + n(9,6) = 2 + 2 = 4$\n*   Choices for $\\chi_3$ (order can be 2, 3, or 6): $n(7,2) + n(7,3) + n(7,6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$\n*   Choices for $\\chi_4$ (order must be 2): $n(11,2) = 1$\n*   Choices for $\\chi_5$ (order can be 2, 3, or 6): $n(13,2) + n(13,3) + n(13,6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$\n\nThe total number of primitive characters whose order divides 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal choices = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we need the LCM of the orders to be exactly 6.\nSince $\\text{ord}(\\chi_1) = 2$ and $\\text{ord}(\\chi_4) = 2$, the LCM is guaranteed to be divisible by 2.\nSo we just need to ensure the LCM is also divisible by 3. This means we must subtract the cases where the LCM is NOT divisible by 3.\nThe LCM is not divisible by 3 if and only if the order of every component character $\\chi_i$ is not divisible by 3.\nGiven that orders must divide 6, the only possible orders not divisible by 3 are 1 and 2. Since all characters must be primitive, their orders must be greater than 1. So we are looking for cases where all component orders are 2.\n\nLet's count the number of combinations where every $\\chi_i$ has order 2:\n*   Choices for $\\chi_1$ (order 2): $n(4,2)=1$\n*   Choices for $\\chi_2$ (order 2): $n(9,2)=0$\n*   Choices for $\\chi_3$ (order 2): $n(7,2)=1$\n*   Choices for $\\chi_4$ (order 2): $n(11,2)=1$\n*   Choices for $\\chi_5$ (order 2): $n(13,2)=1$\n\nThe number of characters with order 2 is the product:\nNumber of choices with LCM=2 is $1 \\times 0 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 0$.\n\nThe number of characters of order 6 is the total number of characters with order dividing 6 minus the number of characters with order dividing 2 (since any character whose order divides 3 would have been zeroed out by $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_4$).\nNumber of order 6 characters = (Total choices where order divides 6) - (Choices where order is 2)\nNumber = $100 - 0 = 100$.\n\nFinal Answer is 100."
