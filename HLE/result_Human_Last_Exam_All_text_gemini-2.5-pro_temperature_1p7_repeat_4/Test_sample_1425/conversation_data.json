    "This problem requires us to find the grand canonical partition function Z for a specific system using the principles of statistical mechanics, particularly informed by the path integral perspective.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Grand Canonical Ensemble and its Partition Function**\nThe grand canonical ensemble describes a quantum system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large external reservoir. The reservoir is characterized by a constant temperature `T` and a constant chemical potential `μ`.\n\nThe partition function `Z` in this ensemble is defined as:\n`Z = Tr(e^(-β(Ĥ - μN̂)))`\nwhere:\n*   `Tr` denotes the trace over the entire Fock space (i.e., summing over all possible states, including states with different particle numbers).\n*   `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse thermal energy (`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant).\n*   `Ĥ` is the Hamiltonian operator of the system, which describes its energy.\n*   `N̂` is the particle number operator.\n*   `μ` is the chemical potential set by the reservoir.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the Given Hamiltonian into the Partition Function**\nThe problem specifies a very simple Hamiltonian for the system: `Ĥ = -μN̂`. This means the system's energy is directly proportional to the number of particles it contains, with a proportionality constant of `-μ`.\n\nWe substitute this `Ĥ` into the general formula for `Z`:\n`Z = Tr(e^(-β((-μN̂) - μN̂)))`\nSimplifying the exponent gives:\n`Z = Tr(e^(-β(-2μN̂)))`\n`Z = Tr(e^(2βμN̂))`\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Expression to the Path Integral Formalism**\nThe path integral formulation of the grand canonical partition function involves an action `S`. For a system of non-interacting particles, the action is generally of the form:\n`S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ) [ ∂_τ + Ĥ_0 - μ ] ψ(x, τ)`\nwhere `Ĥ_0` is the single-particle Hamiltonian (e.g., the kinetic energy operator `-ħ²∇²/2m`).\n\nIn our case, the operator in the exponent is `K̂ = Ĥ - μN̂ = -2μN̂`. We can rewrite `N̂` in second quantization as `N̂ = ∫ d^d x ψ*(x)ψ(x)`. So, `K̂ = -2μ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x)ψ(x)`. This implies that our system is equivalent to a gas of non-interacting particles where the single-particle Hamiltonian `Ĥ_0` is zero, and the effective chemical potential is `μ_eff = 2μ`.\n\nThe action becomes:\n`S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ) [ ∂_τ - 2μ ] ψ(x, τ)`\nThis formulation confirms that the problem is equivalent to finding the partition function for a system of non-interacting particles with zero kinetic energy and a chemical potential of `2μ`.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Trace by Summing Over States**\nTo evaluate `Z = Tr(e^(2βμN̂))`, we sum the expectation value of the operator `e^(2βμN̂)` over a complete set of basis states. The most convenient basis is the Fock space basis, `|n_1, n_2, ...⟩`, where `n_k` is the occupation number of the `k`-th single-particle state. The operator `N̂` is diagonal in this basis: `N̂|{n_k}⟩ = (∑_k n_k)|{n_k}⟩`.\n\nThe partition function becomes:\n`Z = ∏_k [ ∑_{n_k} (e^(2βμ))^n_k ]`\nwhere the product is over all available single-particle states `k`, and the sum is over the allowed occupation numbers `n_k` for each state.\n\n**Step 5: Address Ambiguities by Making Necessary Simplifications**\nThe problem is not fully specified. We need to know:\n1.  **Particle Statistics:** Are the particles bosons or fermions? This determines the allowed values for `n_k`.\n2.  **Number of States:** How many single-particle states `k` are available?\n\nTo arrive at a concrete answer, we must make some reasonable assumptions.\n*   **Number of States:** Such problems often imply the simplest possible physical system. We will assume there is only **one** single-particle state available. This removes the product over `k`.\n*   **Particle Statistics:** The path integral can be formulated for either bosons (using complex fields) or fermions (using Grassmann fields). Since it's not specified, we can analyze both cases. However, if a single answer is required, choosing the bosonic case is a common convention as scalar fields are the simplest quantum fields. We will proceed with the **bosonic** case.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Partition Function for the Simplified System (Single Bosonic State)**\nFor bosons, the occupation number `n` of a single state can be any non-negative integer: `n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`.\nWith a single state, our partition function from Step 4 simplifies to:\n`Z = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (e^(2βμ))^n`\n\nThis is a standard geometric series of the form `∑_{n=0}^∞ x^n`, where `x = e^(2βμ)`. The sum converges to `1/(1-x)` if and only if `|x| < 1`.\n\nTherefore, the partition function is:\n`Z = 1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))`\n\nThis result is valid under the convergence condition `|e^(2βμ)| < 1`, which implies `2βμ < 0`. Since `β > 0`, this requires the chemical potential to be negative (`μ < 0`), a well-known condition for a gas of non-interacting bosons with a zero-energy ground state.\n\n**(Alternative for Fermions)**\nFor completeness, if we had assumed the particles were fermions, the occupation number `n` could only be 0 or 1. The sum would be:\n`Z_F = (e^(2βμ))^0 + (e^(2βμ))^1 = 1 + e^(2βμ)`\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe chosen interpretation is a system consisting of a single bosonic state.\n1.  **Grand Canonical Operator:** `K̂ = Ĥ - μN̂ = -μN̂ - μN̂ = -2μN̂`.\n2.  **Partition Function:** `Z = Tr(e^(-βK̂)) = Tr(e^(2βμN̂))`.\n3.  **Trace over single bosonic state:** `Z = ∑_{n=0}^∞ ⟨n|e^(2βμN̂)|n⟩ = ∑_{n=0}^∞ e^(2βμn)`.\n4.  **Geometric Series Sum:** `Z = 1 + e^(2βμ) + e^(4βμ) + ... = 1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))`.\n\nThis result is conditional on `μ < 0`.\n\n<<<1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))>>>"
