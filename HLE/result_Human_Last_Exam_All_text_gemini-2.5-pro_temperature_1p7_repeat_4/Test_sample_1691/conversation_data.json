    "An step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**1. Analyze the Integral and Identify the Singularity**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$.\nWe are interested in the limit where $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of $g(x)$ on the interval $[0, 15]$.\nFor $x > 0$, $g(x) > 0$.\nAt $x=0$, we have $g(0) = 0$.\n\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)}$ converges to $\\frac{1}{g(x)}$ for any $x > 0$. However, at $x=0$, the denominator approaches 0, and the integrand diverges. This type of behavior is known as a singular perturbation. The dominant contribution to the integral for small $\\epsilon$ will come from a very small region (a boundary layer) around $x=0$.\n\n**2. Approximate the Denominator near the Singularity**\n\nNear $x=0$, the function $g(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$:\n$g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$ for small $x$.\n\nThe main contribution to the integral comes from the region where the $\\epsilon$ term is comparable to the $g(x)$ term. This \"dominant balance\" occurs when $\\epsilon \\approx 9x^5$, which implies $x \\sim (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}$. Since $\\epsilon$ is small, this confirms that the region of importance is a small interval near $x=0$.\n\n**3. Formulate an Approximate Integral**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can approximate the integral in two ways:\na) Replace $g(x)$ with its leading-order approximation, $9x^5$.\nb) Extend the upper limit of integration from $15$ to $\\infty$. This is justified because the integrand becomes very small for large $x$, so the contribution from the tail end of the integral is negligible compared to the diverging part near $x=0$.\n\nThe resulting approximate integral is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**4. Solve the Approximate Integral**\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a scaling substitution to make it dimensionless.\nLet's introduce a new variable $y$ such that the two terms in the denominator become of the same order.\nLet $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} y$.\nThen $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} dy$.\nThe denominator becomes:\n$\\epsilon + 9x^5 = \\epsilon + 9 \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} y \\right)^5 = \\epsilon + 9 \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right) y^5 = \\epsilon + \\epsilon y^5 = \\epsilon(1 + y^5)$.\nThe limits of integration for $y$: when $x=0$, $y=0$; when $x=\\infty$, $y=\\infty$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} dy}{\\epsilon(1 + y^5)}$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5} \\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + y^5} dy$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + y^5} dy$\n\n**5. Evaluate the Definite Integral**\n\nThe remaining definite integral $J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + y^5} dy$ is a standard form that can be evaluated using the Beta function or Gamma function.\nWe use the substitution $u = y^5$, so $y = u^{1/5}$ and $dy = \\frac{1}{5}u^{-4/5}du$.\n$J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u} \\left(\\frac{1}{5} u^{-4/5}\\right) du = \\frac{1}{5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{1/5-1}}{1+u} du$\n\nThe integral is a representation of the Beta function:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{p-1}}{1+t} dt = B(p, 1-p) = \\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(1-p) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi p)}$\n\nFor our integral, $p = 1/5$. Therefore:\n$J = \\frac{1}{5} B\\left(\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Formula**\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $J$ back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right)$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThis is the leading-order asymptotic formula for $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$.\n\nFinal Answer Careful Points Checklist:\n- The problem is a singular perturbation at $x=0$.\n- The leading behavior of $g(x)$ near $x=0$ is $9x^5$.\n- The power of $\\epsilon$ is determined by the power of $x$ in the leading term of $g(x)$. For $x^\\alpha$, the power of $\\epsilon$ is $1/\\alpha-1$. Here $\\alpha=5$, so the power is $1/5 - 1 = -4/5$.\n- The coefficient involves the coefficient of the leading term of $g(x)$ and a definite integral related to the Beta function.\n- All constants like $\\pi$ and sine function should be kept for an analytical formula.\n\nThe derived formula represents the dominant behavior of the integral as $\\epsilon$ approaches zero.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$>>>"
