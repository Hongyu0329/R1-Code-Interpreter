    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user wants to know the specific year in which the person identified as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly adopted or identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Verify the Subject's Name:** The first and most critical step is to verify the full and correct name of the individual in question. The 14th President of Nigeria is known worldwide as **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Check for the Name \"Azikiwe\":**\n    *   His given name is Goodluck.\n    *   His middle name is **Ebele**.\n    *   His family name is Jonathan.\n    *   The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his officially recognized or commonly used name.\n\n4.  **Identify Potential Sources of Confusion:** The name \"Azikiwe\" is very prominent in Nigerian history. It belongs to **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria (1963–1966). It is possible the question confuses the two political figures or is based on misinformation that connects them by name.\n\n5.  **Search for Evidence:** A thorough check of credible sources, including official records, reputable news archives (like BBC, Reuters, Associated Press), and academic papers on Nigerian politics, is necessary. This search is for any instance where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has publicly stated his name is or includes \"Azikiwe\" or has signed official documents in that manner.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Findings:** The search reveals no credible evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has ever used the name \"Azikiwe\" as part of his own name. He has always been known and has identified himself as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Jonathan's name, the event described in the question—him publicly identifying as \"Azikiwe\"—has never occurred. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** Always verify the full, official names of public figures, as questions can sometimes contain incorrect information.\n*   **Premise of the Question:** It is crucial to determine if the premise of the question is factually correct. In this case, the premise that Goodluck Jonathan has the name \"Azikiwe\" is incorrect.\n*   **Absence of Evidence vs. Evidence of Absence:** While it is difficult to prove a negative definitively, in the case of a public figure's name, the consistent and exclusive use of \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\" across all official and media records provides overwhelming evidence that \"Azikiwe\" is not his name.\n*   **Historical Context:** Recognizing the name \"Azikiwe\" as belonging to another major Nigerian leader is key to understanding the likely source of the error in the question.\n\nBased on this analysis, the question is unanswerable because it is based on a false premise.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe.\" This name is not part of his official name, which is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Therefore, such an event has never occurred.>>>"
