    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols: T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n\n**1. Understand the Constraints**\n\n*   **Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n*   **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Repetition:** Symbols can be repeated.\n*   **Evaluation:** The final expression must evaluate to True.\n*   **Precedence:** Standard operator precedence is followed: `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest).\n\n**2. Method: Categorize by Structure**\n\nWe can find all possible valid expressions by considering different structural patterns. The most logical way to categorize is by the presence or absence of parentheses `()`.\n\n*   **Group A: Expressions without parentheses `()`**\n*   **Group B: Expressions with parentheses `()`**\n\nWe will analyze each group, find all valid 5-symbol structures, and then count how many of them evaluate to True.\n\n---\n\n### **Group A: Expressions Without Parentheses**\n\nThese expressions are built using only {T, F, !, &, |}.\n\n**Structure 1: `Operand op1 Operand op2 Operand`**\nThis structure has the form `A op1 B op2 C`, where A, B, C are `T` or `F`, and `op1`, `op2` are `&` or `|`. This is a 5-symbol expression. The evaluation depends on operator precedence (`&` before `|`).\n\n*   **`A & B & C`**: Evaluates as `(A & B) & C`. True only if A, B, and C are all `T`.\n    *   `T & T & T` -> True (1 expression)\n*   **`A | B | C`**: Evaluates as `(A | B) | C`. False only if A, B, and C are all `F`. There are 2*2*2 = 8 combinations for A,B,C. So, 7 are true.\n    *   (7 expressions)\n*   **`A & B | C`**: Evaluates as `(A & B) | C`. This is true if `C=T` (4 combinations for A, B) or if `C=F` and `A=T` and `B=T` (1 combination).\n    *   4 + 1 = 5 expressions\n*   **`A | B & C`**: Evaluates as `A | (B & C)`. This is true if `A=T` (4 combinations for B, C) or if `A=F` and `B=T` and `C=T` (1 combination).\n    *   4 + 1 = 5 expressions\n\nTotal for Structure 1: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18**\n\n**Structure 2: `!!Operand op Operand`**\nForm: `!!A op B`. Symbols: `!`, `!`, A, `op`, B. (5 symbols). This parses as `(!!A) op B`, which simplifies to `A op B`.\n\n*   `A & B` is true for `T & T`. (1 expression: `!!T & T`)\n*   `A | B` is true for 3 of 4 combinations. (3 expressions: `!!T | T`, `!!T | F`, `!!F | T`)\n\nTotal for Structure 2: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 3: `Operand op !!Operand`**\nForm: `A op !!B`. Symbols: A, `op`, `!`, `!`, B. (5 symbols). Parses as `A op (!!B)`, which simplifies to `A op B`.\n\n*   This is symmetric to Structure 2.\n\nTotal for Structure 3: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 4: `!Operand op !Operand`**\nForm: `!A op !B`. Symbols: `!`, A, `op`, `!`, B. (5 symbols). Parses as `(!A) op (!B)`.\n\n*   `!A & !B` is true only if `!A=T` and `!B=T`, which means `A=F` and `B=F`. (1 expression: `!F & !F`)\n*   `!A | !B` is false only if `!A=F` and `!B=F`, which means `A=T` and `B=T`. So, 3 of 4 combinations are true. (3 expressions)\n\nTotal for Structure 4: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 5: `!!!!Operand`**\nForm: `!!!!A`. Symbols: `!`, `!`, `!`, `!`, A. (5 symbols). This simplifies to `A`.\n\n*   To be true, `A` must be `T`. (1 expression: `!!!!T`)\n\nTotal for Structure 5: **1**\n\n**Total for Group A = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31**\n\n---\n\n### **Group B: Expressions With Parentheses**\n\nThe expression must contain one `(` and one `)`. This uses 2 of the 5 symbols, leaving 3 symbols for the content.\n\n**Structure 1: `( expression of length 3 )`**\nThe expression inside the parentheses must have 3 symbols. It also must evaluate to True. Valid 3-symbol expressions are of the form `A op B`, `!!A`, or `(A)`.\n\n*   `A op B` that are True: `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. (4 expressions)\n*   `!!A` that is True: `!!T`. (1 expression)\n*   `(A)` that is True: `(T)`. (1 expression)\n\nPlacing these 6 true expressions inside parentheses gives 6 true expressions of length 5: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(!!T)`, `((T))`.\n\nTotal for Structure 1: **6**\n\n**Structure 2: `!(expression of length 2)`**\nFor the total length to be 5, the expression `X` in `!(X)` must have length 2 (since `!,(,` and `)` are 3 symbols). Valid 2-symbol expressions are `!T` and `!F`. The outer expression `!(X)` is true if `X` is false.\n\n*   `!T` evaluates to False. So, `X = !T` works. (1 expression: `!(!T)`)\n*   `!F` evaluates to True. So, `!(!F)` is false.\n\nTotal for Structure 2: **1**\n\n**Structure 3: `(Operand) op Operand`**\nForm: `(A) op B`. Symbols: `(`, A, `)`, `op`, B. (5 symbols). This simplifies to `A op B`.\n\n*   `A & B` is true for `T & T`. (1 expression: `(T)&T`)\n*   `A | B` is true for 3 combinations. (3 expressions: `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`)\n\nTotal for Structure 3: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 4: `Operand op (Operand)`**\nForm: `A op (B)`. This is symmetric to Structure 3.\n\n*   `A & (B)` is true once: `T&(T)`. (1)\n*   `A | (B)` is true three times: `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. (3)\n\nTotal for Structure 4: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Total for Group B = 6 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nTotal True Expressions = (Total from Group A) + (Total from Group B)\nTotal True Expressions = 31 + 15 = 46."
