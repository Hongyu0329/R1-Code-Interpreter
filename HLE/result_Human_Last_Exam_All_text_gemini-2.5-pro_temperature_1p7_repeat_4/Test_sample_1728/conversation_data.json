    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of the graph G**\n\nThe problem states that the graph \\( G \\) is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs, often denoted by the `+` symbol, refers to the **graph join** operation.\n\n*   **Graph Join (G1 + G2):** The join of two vertex-disjoint graphs, G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2), is a new graph G = G1 + G2. The vertex set of G is the union of the vertex sets of G1 and G2 (V = V1 U V2). The edge set of G consists of all edges from G1 and G2, plus all possible edges connecting any vertex of G1 to any vertex of G2.\n    *   E(G) = E1 U E2 U { (u, v) | u ∈ V1, v ∈ V2 }.\n\n*   **The graph G:** In this problem, G is the join of three copies of a cycle of length \\( n \\). Let's call these three cycles A, B, and C, where each is a \\( C_n \\).\n    *   G = A + B + C.\n    *   The vertices of G are the combined vertices of A, B, and C.\n    *   The edges of G include all edges within A, all edges within B, all edges within C, and additionally, every vertex of A is connected to every vertex of B, every vertex of A is connected to every vertex of C, and every vertex of B is connected to every vertex of C.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the formula for the chromatic number of G**\n\nWe need to find the chromatic number of G, denoted as \\( \\chi(G) \\). There is a standard property for the chromatic number of a graph join:\n\n*   **Chromatic Number of a Join:** For any two graphs G1 and G2, \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\).\n    *   **Justification:** In any proper coloring of G1 + G2, a vertex in G1 cannot have the same color as any vertex in G2 because they are all adjacent. This means the set of colors used for G1 must be completely disjoint from the set of colors used for G2. Therefore, the minimum number of total colors required is the sum of the minimum colors required for each graph individually.\n\nThis property extends to the join of multiple graphs. For our graph G = A + B + C:\n*   \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(A) + \\chi(B) + \\chi(C) \\)\nSince A, B, and C are all cycles of length \\( n \\) (\\( C_n \\)), their chromatic numbers are identical.\n*   \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\n**Step 3: Find the chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\)**\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd. We assume \\( n \\ge 3 \\), as cycles are generally defined for \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n\n*   **Case 1: \\( n \\) is even (e.g., n = 4, 6, 8, ...)**\n    *   An even cycle is a bipartite graph. Its vertices can be colored using only two colors, by alternating them around the cycle.\n    *   Thus, for even \\( n \\ge 4 \\), \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n\n*   **Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd (e.g., n = 3, 5, 7, ...)**\n    *   An odd cycle is not bipartite and requires at least three colors. You can color \\( n-1 \\) vertices with two alternating colors, but the last vertex will be adjacent to two vertices of different colors, requiring a third color.\n    *   Thus, for odd \\( n \\ge 3 \\), \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate G's maximal chromatic number**\n\nFrom the previous steps, we know \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\), and the value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) can be either 2 or 3, depending on the parameter \\( n \\). The question asks for the \"maximal\" chromatic number, which means we should find the largest possible value for \\( \\chi(G) \\) by choosing \\( n \\) appropriately.\n\n*   If we choose an even \\( n \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\).\n*   If we choose an odd \\( n \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n\nComparing the two possible values, {6, 9}, the maximum is 9. This maximum is achieved whenever \\( n \\) is an odd integer greater than or equal to 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Sum of Graphs\":** The term \"sum\" must be correctly identified as the graph join operation. Other operations like disjoint union or Cartesian product are denoted differently and would yield much smaller chromatic numbers.\n2.  **Chromatic Number of Join Property:** The formula \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\) is central to the solution.\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle:** Correctly recalling or deriving that \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\) for even \\( n \\) and \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\) for odd \\( n \\) is crucial. We must consider \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n4.  **Meaning of \"Maximal\":** The question implies that \\( n \\) is a parameter. The task is to find the maximum possible value of \\( \\chi(G) \\) over all valid choices of \\( n \\).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  Let G be the join of three cycles of length \\( n \\), G = \\( C_n + C_n + C_n \\).\n2.  The chromatic number of G is given by \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n3.  The chromatic number of a cycle, \\( \\chi(C_n) \\), can be either 2 (if \\( n \\) is even) or 3 (if \\( n \\) is odd), for \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n4.  To maximize \\( \\chi(G) \\), we must maximize \\( \\chi(C_n) \\).\n5.  The maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is odd.\n6.  Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of G is \\( 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n\n<<<9>>>"
