The probability is given by the expression $E_f \left[ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 f(u,v) \,du \,dv \right]$, where the outer expectation $E_f[\cdot]$ is taken with respect to the random measure F that determines the random graphon function f, and u and v are variables of integration over the uniform measure U on [0,1].
