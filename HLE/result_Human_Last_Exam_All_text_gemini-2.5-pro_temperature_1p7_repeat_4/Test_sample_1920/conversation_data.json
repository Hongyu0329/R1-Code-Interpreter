    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Conductor and the Structure of the Character\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test small prime factors.\n*   $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n*   $7657 = 13 \\times 589$\n*   $589 = 19 \\times 31$\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Since $d$ is square-free, it is a product of distinct primes.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo each prime factor, according to the Chinese Remainder Theorem:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Conditions on the Character\nWe are given two conditions for the character $\\chi$:\n1.  **The character is primitive with conductor d**: A character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_{p_i}$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i}$ is primitive. The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components. For the conductor of $\\chi$ to be $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, the conductor of each $\\chi_p$ must be $p$.\n    For a character modulo a prime $p$, it is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial. The only non-primitive character is the trivial character, which has conductor 1. Therefore, each character $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial. This means the order of each $\\chi_p$, denoted as $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be greater than 1.\n\n2.  **The order of the character is 6**: The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Available Component Characters\nFor each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check the possible orders for the component characters. The condition $\\text{lcm}(\\dots) = 6$ implies that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial, their orders must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nNow let's verify if characters of these orders exist for each prime factor:\n*   **For p=7**: The character group has order $7-1=6$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 6, characters of these orders exist.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $N_7(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $N_7(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $N_7(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   **For p=13**: The character group has order $13-1=12$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 12, characters of these orders exist.\n    *   $N_{13}(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_{13}(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_{13}(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   **For p=19**: The character group has order $19-1=18$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 18, characters of these orders exist.\n    *   $N_{19}(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_{19}(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_{19}(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   **For p=31**: The character group has order $31-1=30$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 30, characters of these orders exist.\n    *   $N_{31}(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_{31}(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_{31}(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nNotice that for each prime factor $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the number of available characters of order $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is the same.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Counts Using Combinatorics\nWe need to form a tuple of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that their orders $(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31})$ satisfy $\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$. The orders $o_p$ must be chosen from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_p) = 6$ is met if and only if:\n*   (A) At least one of the orders is divisible by 2 (i.e., is 2 or 6).\n*   (B) At least one of the orders is divisible by 3 (i.e., is 3 or 6).\n\nWe can solve this using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Let's first calculate the total number of ways to pick four non-trivial characters whose orders divide 6. For each prime $p$, the number of choices is $N_p(2) + N_p(3) + N_p(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are four primes, the total number of such tuples of characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis total count includes combinations where the lcm is less than 6. We must subtract the combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 2 or 3, since orders are > 1).\n*   **Case 1: The lcm of the orders is 2.** This happens only if every component character $\\chi_p$ has order 2. For each prime, there is $N_p(2) = 1$ character of order 2. So, there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$ such combination.\n*   **Case 2: The lcm of the orders is 3.** This happens only if every component character $\\chi_p$ has order 3. For each prime, there are $N_p(3) = 2$ characters of order 3. So, there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$ such combinations.\n\nThese two cases are mutually exclusive (a character cannot have order both 2 and 3). So, the total number of invalid combinations is $1 + 16 = 17$.\n\nThe number of combinations where the lcm is exactly 6 is the total number of possibilities minus the invalid ones:\nNumber of characters = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
