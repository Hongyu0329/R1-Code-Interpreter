    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, where $T$ is Thompson's group T.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the group and its bounded cohomology\n\nThe group in question is $G = T \\times T$. We need to find the dimension of $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$. The first step is to understand the bounded cohomology of the factor group, Thompson's group T. The key properties of the bounded cohomology of T with trivial real coefficients are:\n\n1.  **Degree 0:** $H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. This is true for any group.\n2.  **Degree 1:** $H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. This is because $H_b^1(G; \\mathbb{R})$ consists of bounded homomorphisms from $G$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Since any homomorphism from $T$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ factors through its abelianization $T_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$, any non-trivial homomorphism is unbounded. The only bounded homomorphism is the trivial one.\n3.  **Degree 2:** $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is a celebrated non-trivial space. It contains the bounded Euler class $e_b$. It is a known result (due to Ghys, Barge, and Matsumoto) that the dimension of this space is infinite. So, $\\dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) = \\infty$.\n4.  **Higher Degrees:** A fundamental result by Monod shows that the bounded cohomology of T vanishes in higher degrees. Specifically, $H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 3$.\n\nIn summary, the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T are:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty$\n*   $\\dim H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for $n \\ge 3$.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the K端nneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology\n\nFor direct products of groups, the standard tool to compute cohomology is the K端nneth formula. For bounded cohomology, this formula is more subtle than for ordinary cohomology. For two countable groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, there is a natural K端nneth short exact sequence:\n$$0 \\to \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1) \\hat\\otimes H_b^q(G_2) \\to H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2) \\to \\bigoplus_{p+q=n-1} \\mathrm{Tor}_1^{\\hat\\otimes}(H_b^p(G_1), H_b^q(G_2)) \\to 0$$\nHere, $\\hat\\otimes$ denotes the projective tensor product of Banach spaces and $\\mathrm{Tor}_1^{\\hat\\otimes}$ is its first derived functor. We are interested in the dimension of the spaces as real vector spaces.\n\nWe apply this formula for $G_1 = G_2 = T$ and degree $n = 4$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Tensor Product Term\n\nThe first term in the sequence is the direct sum of tensor products:\n$$ \\bigoplus_{p+q=4} H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nWe need to sum over all pairs of non-negative integers $(p, q)$ such that $p+q=4$. We check the dimension of each term $H_b^p(T) \\otimes H_b^q(T)$:\n*   $(p,q) = (0,4)$: $H_b^0(T) \\otimes H_b^4(T) = \\mathbb{R} \\otimes \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$.\n*   $(p,q) = (1,3)$: $H_b^1(T) \\otimes H_b^3(T) = \\{0\\} \\otimes \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$.\n*   $(p,q) = (2,2)$: $H_b^2(T) \\otimes H_b^2(T)$. Since $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty$, the dimension of this tensor product is also infinite.\n*   $(p,q) = (3,1)$: $H_b^3(T) \\otimes H_b^1(T) = \\{0\\} \\otimes \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$.\n*   $(p,q) = (4,0)$: $H_b^4(T) \\otimes H_b^0(T) = \\{0\\} \\otimes \\mathbb{R} = \\{0\\}$.\n\nThe only non-zero contribution comes from $(p,q)=(2,2)$. Thus, the tensor term simplifies to $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$, which is an infinite-dimensional vector space.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Tor Term\n\nThe third term in the sequence is the direct sum of Tor groups:\n$$ \\bigoplus_{p+q=3} \\mathrm{Tor}_1(H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}), H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})) $$\nWe sum over pairs $(p, q)$ with $p+q=3$:\n*   $(p,q) = (0,3)$: $H_b^3(T) = \\{0\\}$, so $\\mathrm{Tor}_1(H_b^0(T), H_b^3(T)) = \\mathrm{Tor}_1(\\mathbb{R}, \\{0\\}) = \\{0\\}$.\n*   $(p,q) = (1,2)$: $H_b^1(T) = \\{0\\}$, so $\\mathrm{Tor}_1(H_b^1(T), H_b^2(T)) = \\mathrm{Tor}_1(\\{0\\}, H_b^2(T)) = \\{0\\}$.\n*   $(p,q) = (2,1)$: $H_b^1(T) = \\{0\\}$, so $\\mathrm{Tor}_1(H_b^2(T), H_b^1(T)) = \\mathrm{Tor}_1(H_b^2(T), \\{0\\}) = \\{0\\}$.\n*   $(p,q) = (3,0)$: $H_b^3(T) = \\{0\\}$, so $\\mathrm{Tor}_1(H_b^3(T), H_b^0(T)) = \\mathrm{Tor}_1(\\{0\\}, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{0\\}$.\n\nAll the Tor terms are zero because for each pair $(p,q)$ with $p+q=3$, at least one of the spaces $H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R})$ or $H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is the zero vector space.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Dimension\n\nWith the Tor term being zero, the K端nneth short exact sequence simplifies to:\n$$ 0 \\to H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\to H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\to 0 $$\nThis implies that there is an isomorphism of vector spaces:\n$$ H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nWe need to find the dimension of this space. The dimension of a tensor product of two vector spaces is the product of their dimensions.\n$$ \\dim(H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})) = \\dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) $$\nSince $\\dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) = \\infty$, the result is:\n$$ \\dim(H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})) = \\infty \\cdot \\infty = \\infty $$\n\nThus, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is infinite.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
