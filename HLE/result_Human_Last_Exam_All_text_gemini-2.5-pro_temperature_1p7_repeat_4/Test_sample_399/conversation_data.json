    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$\nx'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)\n$$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1) \\cdot x^2\n$$\nThis equation is a **separable differential equation** because we can write it in the form $g(x)dx = h(t)dt$ by rearranging the terms involving $x$ and $t$ to opposite sides of the equation.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\n\nTo separate the variables, we divide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply both sides by $dt$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n**Careful point:** When we divide by $x^2$, we are implicitly assuming that $x(t) \\neq 0$. We should check if $x(t) = 0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$, and the right side of the equation is $(t-1)(0)^2 = 0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is indeed a solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0) = -8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the particular solution we are looking for is not the constant zero solution, and our division by $x^2$ is valid for this initial value problem.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\n\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nLet's compute each integral separately.\n*   **Left-hand side integral:**\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-2+1}}{-2+1} = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}\n    $$\n*   **Right-hand side integral:**\n    $$\n    \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t\n    $$\nCombining the results and adding a constant of integration, $C$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\n\nThe initial condition is given as $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to find the value of $C$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C\n$$\nSo, the constant of integration is $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**5. Write down the particular solution**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1)**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. To find this, we first substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution equation.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nNow, we simplify the right-hand side:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo combine the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $x(1)$. We can multiply both sides by -1:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides to find $x(1)$:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
