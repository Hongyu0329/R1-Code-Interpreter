    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the person in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Clues:** The question provides several specific clues that need to be decoded and combined:\n    *   **The \"work\":** This work contains a \"prohibition against representation.\" In a Western religious and philosophical context, this immediately brings to mind the Second Commandment in the Decalogue (Ten Commandments): \"You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\"\n    *   **The \"end of HIS work\":** At the conclusion of this same work, a different issue is addressed: \"another's material possessions.\" This corresponds perfectly with the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.\"\n    *   **The Interpretation:** Veronika Campan, a scholar likely in the field of psychoanalysis or philosophy, has a specific interpretation. She argues that the final commandment (on coveting possessions) \"naturally ignores the prohibition against representation.\"\n    *   **The Figure \"HE\":** The person (\"HE\") is the one associated with authoring or delivering this \"work.\"\n\n2.  **Connecting the Clues:**\n    *   The \"work\" is clearly the Ten Commandments.\n    *   The figure who received and delivered the Ten Commandments to the people, according to the Book of Exodus in the Bible, is **Moses**. He is the great lawgiver of the Israelites.\n    *   This leads us to examine Veronika Campan's interpretation in this context.\n\n3.  **Understanding Veronika Campan's Interpretation:**\n    *   The interpretation revolves around the tension between the Second and Tenth Commandments.\n    *   The Second Commandment forbids making an *external, visual representation* (a graven image). It's a prohibition on the senses, particularly sight.\n    *   The Tenth Commandment, however, deals with an *internal, mental representation*. To \"covet\" something (your neighbor's house, wife, ox), you must first form a mental image or idea of it. You must represent the desired object in your mind.\n    *   Therefore, by forbidding the mental act of coveting, the Tenth Commandment necessarily has to name—and thus bring into representation through language—the very objects of desire. In doing so, it implicitly acknowledges that representation is at the heart of human desire. This is how the final commandment can be seen as \"naturally ignoring\" the absolute prohibition on images stated at the beginning; it shifts the focus from external images to the internal representations that fuel desire.\n\n4.  **Final Identification:**\n    *   All clues point to the Ten Commandments as the \"work.\"\n    *   The central human figure who delivered this work is the biblical prophet and lawgiver.\n    *   His full name, as universally recognized, is **Moses**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The \"Author\":** While the Ten Commandments are said to have originated from God, they were transmitted to humanity through Moses, who is considered the lawgiver and the human agent responsible for the \"work.\" In analyses like Campan's, \"HE\" would refer to this central figure in the text's narrative.\n*   **The \"Full Name\":** For biblical figures like Moses, the single name is their full and accepted name. There is no known family or surname.\n*   **The Interpretation's Context:** This type of analysis is common in post-structuralist and psychoanalytic thought (particularly Lacanian), which often examines the underlying structure and paradoxes within foundational texts. Veronika Campan's work fits within this tradition.\n\nBy putting all these pieces together, the identity of \"HE\" is unequivocally established.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
