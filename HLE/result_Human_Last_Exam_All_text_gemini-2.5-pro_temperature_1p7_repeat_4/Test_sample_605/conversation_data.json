    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau threefold.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem's setup\n\nWe are given a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$. It is described as a hypersurface in a 4-dimensional weighted projective space, $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n*   **The weights** are given as $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n*   **The defining polynomial** is given as $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3=0$.\n*   **The goal** is to compute the Crawley-Nordström invariant, $\\text{inv}_{CN}(X)$.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Calabi-Yau condition\n\nA hypersurface $X_d$ defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, ..., w_5)$ is Calabi-Yau if the degree $d$ is equal to the sum of the weights.\n*   Sum of weights: $\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n*   So, the degree of the defining polynomial must be $d = 225$.\n*   Let's check the degree of each monomial in the given polynomial $P$:\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_1^8z_3) = 8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8(22) + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2^7) = 1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1(22) + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = \\sum w_i = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_2z_3^4) = 1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_4^3z_5) = 3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3(50) + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_5^3) = 3 \\cdot w_5 = 3(75) = 225$.\n\n**Careful Point:** One monomial, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, has degree 224, not 225. This means the polynomial as written is not quasi-homogeneous. This is likely a typo in the problem statement. However, the calculation of the invariant should rely on the intrinsic properties of the ambient space, namely the weights and the correct degree $d=225$, rather than the specific (and likely flawed) coefficients of one example polynomial. We will proceed assuming the CY manifold is well-defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of degree 225.\n\n### Step 3: Define and calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant, in the context of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces, counts the number of complex structure moduli that are associated with the singular strata of the ambient space. A practical method to calculate this involves counting specific types of monomials.\n\nThe invariant is the number of independent monomial terms in the defining polynomial that are functions of only those variables $z_i, z_j$ whose weights $w_i, w_j$ share a common factor greater than 1. Such monomials control whether the Calabi-Yau hypersurface contains the corresponding singular curve of the ambient space.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Identify all pairs of indices $(i,j)$ such that $\\gcd(w_i, w_j) > 1$.\n2.  For each such pair, count the number of monomials of the form $z_i^a z_j^b$ (where $a, b$ are non-negative integers) that have the Calabi-Yau degree $d=225$.\n3.  The sum of these counts is the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Step 4: Execute the calculation\n\n1.  **Identify pairs with common factors in their weights:**\n    *   $w_1 = 22 = 2 \\times 11$\n    *   $w_2 = 29$ (prime)\n    *   $w_3 = 49 = 7^2$\n    *   $w_4 = 50 = 2 \\times 5^2$\n    *   $w_5 = 75 = 3 \\times 5^2$\n    Let's check all pairs $\\gcd(w_i, w_j)$:\n    *   $\\gcd(w_1, w_4) = \\gcd(22, 50) = 2$. This is a relevant pair.\n    *   $\\gcd(w_4, w_5) = \\gcd(50, 75) = 25$. This is a relevant pair.\n    *   All other pairs of weights are coprime. For example, $\\gcd(w_1, w_2)=\\gcd(22,29)=1$, $\\gcd(w_1,w_5)=\\gcd(22,75)=1$, etc.\n\n2.  **Count monomials for each pair:**\n\n    *   **Pair (1, 4):** We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions $(a, b)$ to the equation for the degree:\n        $a \\cdot w_1 + b \\cdot w_4 = d$\n        $22a + 50b = 225$\n        The left side of the equation is $2(11a + 25b)$, which is always an even number. The right side, 225, is an odd number. Therefore, there are no integer solutions for $(a, b)$.\n        The number of monomials for this pair is 0.\n\n    *   **Pair (4, 5):** We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions $(a, b)$ to the equation:\n        $a \\cdot w_4 + b \\cdot w_5 = d$\n        $50a + 75b = 225$\n        Divide the entire equation by their greatest common divisor, 25:\n        $2a + 3b = 9$\n        We are looking for non-negative integer solutions $(a,b)$. We can test values for $b$:\n        *   If $b=0$: $2a = 9$. No integer solution for $a$.\n        *   If $b=1$: $2a = 9 - 3 = 6 \\implies a=3$. This gives the solution $(a,b)=(3,1)$. This corresponds to the monomial $z_4^3z_5^1$.\n        *   If $b=2$: $2a = 9 - 6 = 3$. No integer solution for $a$.\n        *   If $b=3$: $2a = 9 - 9 = 0 \\implies a=0$. This gives the solution $(a,b)=(0,3)$. This corresponds to the monomial $z_5^3$.\n        *   If $b>3$: $2a$ would be negative, no solution for non-negative $a$.\n        So, there are exactly two solutions. The number of monomials for this pair is 2.\n\n3.  **Sum the counts:**\n    The total Crawley-Nordström invariant is the sum of the counts from all relevant pairs.\n    $\\text{inv}_{CN}(X) = (\\text{count for (1,4)}) + (\\text{count for (4,5)}) = 0 + 2 = 2$.\n\nThe specific polynomial provided in the question, despite its flaw, includes the two monomials we found ($z_4^3z_5$ and $z_5^3$), which supports our calculation. The coefficients of these terms are the moduli that control the geometry around the singular curve $L_{45} = \\{z_1=z_2=z_3=0\\}$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
