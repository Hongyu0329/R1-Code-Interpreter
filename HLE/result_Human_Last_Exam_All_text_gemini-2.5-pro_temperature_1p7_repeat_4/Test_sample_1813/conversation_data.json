    "Answering the question requires understanding the relationship between rational numbers and Markov numbers, which can be described using the structure of the Farey tree. The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is the largest integer in the Markov triple \\((x, y, z)\\) that is associated with the rational number \\(p/q\\). These numbers can be computed recursively.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Farey Tree and Markov Numbers Connection\n\nThe integer solutions to the Markov equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\) form a tree, starting from the fundamental solution \\((1, 1, 1)\\) (or \\((1,1,2)\\) if we exclude the singular case). This tree structure is mirrored by the Farey tree of rational numbers.\n\nA rational number \\(p/q\\) between 0 and 1 can be generated by starting with \\(0/1\\) and \\(1/1\\) and repeatedly taking the mediant of two Farey neighbors. The mediant of \\(p_1/q_1\\) and \\(p_2/q_2\\) is \\((p_1+p_2)/(q_1+q_2)\\).\n\nA recursive formula connects the Markov numbers associated with these rationals. If \\(t\\) is the mediant of \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\), then its Markov number \\(m_t\\) is given by:\n\\(m_t = 3 m_{r_1} m_{r_2} - m_g\\)\nwhere \\(m_{r_1}\\) and \\(m_{r_2}\\) are the Markov numbers of the parent rationals, and \\(m_g\\) is the Markov number of their \"grandparent\" in the Farey tree. The grandparent of the edge \\((r_1, r_2)\\) is the rational \\(g\\) such that \\(r_1\\) is the mediant of \\(g\\) and \\(r_2\\) (or vice versa).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Farey Ancestry of 4/7\n\nWe need to find the sequence of mediants that generates \\(4/7\\). We work backwards from \\(4/7\\).\nThe parents of a rational \\(p/q\\) in the Farey sequence are \\(p_1/q_1\\) and \\(p_2/q_2\\) such that \\(p=p_1+p_2\\) and \\(q=q_1+q_2\\) with \\(p_1q_2 - p_2q_1 = \\pm 1\\). This can be found by \"un-adding\" the fraction, a process related to the continued fraction expansion.\n\n1.  **Parents of 4/7**: The fraction \\(4/7\\) is the mediant of \\(1/2\\) and \\(3/5\\), since \\(1+3=4\\) and \\(2+5=7\\). We can verify they are Farey neighbors: \\(1 \\cdot 5 - 2 \\cdot 3 = 5 - 6 = -1\\).\n    So, to find \\(m_{4/7}\\), we need \\(m_{1/2}\\) and \\(m_{3/5}\\).\n\n2.  **Grandparent of (1/2, 3/5)**: We need to find the parent of either \\(1/2\\) or \\(3/5\\) that is not the other fraction. The parents of \\(3/5\\) are \\(1/2\\) and \\(2/3\\) (since \\(3/5 = (1+2)/(2+3)\\)). Thus, the grandparent for the calculation of \\(m_{4/7}\\) is \\(2/3\\).\n\nTherefore, the formula for \\(m_{4/7}\\) is:\n\\(m_{4/7} = 3 \\cdot m_{1/2} \\cdot m_{3/5} - m_{2/3}\\)\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Required Markov Numbers\n\nWe need to compute \\(m_{1/2}\\), \\(m_{2/3}\\), and \\(m_{3/5}\\). We start from the base cases.\nBase cases:\n*   \\(m_{0/1} = 1\\)\n*   \\(m_{1/1} = 2\\)\n*   The \"ancestor\" of the fundamental interval \\((0/1, 1/1)\\) is \\(1/0\\), whose associated number is \\(m_{1/0}=1\\).\n\n**Calculation of \\(m_{1/2}\\):**\n*   Parents: \\(1/2\\) is the mediant of \\(0/1\\) and \\(1/1\\).\n*   Grandparent: The ancestor of the pair \\((0/1, 1/1)\\) is \\(1/0\\).\n*   \\(m_{1/2} = 3 \\cdot m_{0/1} \\cdot m_{1/1} - m_{1/0} = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 - 1 = 5\\).\n\n**Calculation of \\(m_{2/3}\\):**\n*   Parents: \\(2/3\\) is the mediant of \\(1/1\\) and \\(1/2\\).\n*   Grandparent: The parents of \\(1/2\\) are \\(0/1\\) and \\(1/1\\). So for the pair \\((1/1, 1/2)\\), the grandparent is \\(0/1\\).\n*   \\(m_{2/3} = 3 \\cdot m_{1/1} \\cdot m_{1/2} - m_{0/1} = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5 - 1 = 29\\).\n\n**Calculation of \\(m_{3/5}\\):**\n*   Parents: \\(3/5\\) is the mediant of \\(1/2\\) and \\(2/3\\).\n*   Grandparent: The parents of \\(2/3\\) are \\(1/1\\) and \\(1/2\\). So for the pair \\((1/2, 2/3)\\), the grandparent is \\(1/1\\).\n*   \\(m_{3/5} = 3 \\cdot m_{1/2} \\cdot m_{2/3} - m_{1/1} = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 29 - 2 = 15 \\cdot 29 - 2 = 435 - 2 = 433\\).\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Final Answer\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\n*   Parents: \\(1/2, 3/5\\)\n*   Grandparent: \\(2/3\\)\n*   Formula: \\(m_{4/7} = 3 \\cdot m_{1/2} \\cdot m_{3/5} - m_{2/3}\\)\n*   Substituting the values:\n    \\(m_{4/7} = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 433 - 29\\)\n    \\(m_{4/7} = 15 \\cdot 433 - 29\\)\n    \\(m_{4/7} = 6495 - 29\\)\n    \\(m_{4/7} = 6466\\)\n\nThe generalized Markov number associated with \\(4/7\\) is 6466.\n\n<<<6466>>>"
