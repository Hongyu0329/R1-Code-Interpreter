    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n*   **Subject:** Andre Vernault\n*   **Nationality:** Belgian\n*   **Status:** Refugee in the UK\n*   **Time Period:** World War II\n*   **Situation:** He was suspected by UK counterintelligence of being a German spy.\n*   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession during interrogation.\n*   **Goal:** Identify his true profession.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key points and potential pitfalls**\n*   The core of the problem is the *reason* for Vernault's secrecy. The British authorities assumed the reason was espionage, which is a logical conclusion for counterintelligence during wartime.\n*   The careful point is that people can have secrets for reasons other than espionage. Vernault was hiding something, but it wasn't that he was a spy. He was afraid of the consequences of his past actions if they were discovered by the British authorities.\n*   The \"true profession\" is linked to an illegal activity he was involved in. This illegal activity is the reason for his concealment.\n\n**Step 3: Acquire the historical facts**\n*   Historical records, particularly those declassified from MI5 and documented in books like Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross,\" detail this specific case.\n*   Andre Vernault was indeed a Belgian refugee who came to the attention of MI5.\n*   He was evasive under questioning, leading his case officer to believe he was a \"sleeper\" agent.\n*   After extensive investigation, MI5 discovered the truth. Vernault's profession was a **pharmacist**.\n*   In Belgium, he had been running an illegal side business, selling morphine on the black market. He concealed his profession because he feared that if the British knew he was a pharmacist, they would investigate his past, uncover his criminal dealings, and prosecute him. His secrecy stemmed from a desire to avoid imprisonment for a non-espionage crime, not from loyalty to Germany.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the final answer**\n*   By putting the facts together, we can conclude that Andre Vernault's true profession was that of a pharmacist. He hid this fact because he had been illegally selling drugs and feared prosecution.\n\n<<<pharmacist>>>"
