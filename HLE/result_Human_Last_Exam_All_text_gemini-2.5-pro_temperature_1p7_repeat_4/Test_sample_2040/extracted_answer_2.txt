No, free-standing boron nanosheets in their commonly observed phases would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The primary reason is that this phenomenon requires the material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion (are non-centrosymmetric). The most stable and commonly synthesized phases of borophene (such as β₁₂ and χ₃) are centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero by symmetry. Therefore, they cannot support second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC.
