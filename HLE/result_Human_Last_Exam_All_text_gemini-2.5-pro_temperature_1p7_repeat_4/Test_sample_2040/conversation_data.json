    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):** This is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In SPDC, a single photon of higher energy (the \"pump\" photon) passes through a specific type of nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). Energy and momentum must be conserved throughout this process.\n*   **Fundamental Requirement for SPDC:** SPDC is a *second-order nonlinear optical process*. The key material property that governs such processes is the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾**. For a material to exhibit SPDC, it must have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n*   **Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** These are two-dimensional (2D), single-atom-thick sheets of boron atoms, analogous to graphene. They are the subject material we need to analyze.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Prerequisite Material Property\n\nThe central question is whether boron nanosheets possess the necessary properties for SPDC. As established in Step 1, the single most important prerequisite is a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Prerequisite Property to Crystal Symmetry\n\nIn crystal optics and materials science, there is a fundamental principle:\n*   **The Inversion Symmetry Rule:** For a material to possess a bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), its crystal lattice structure **must lack a center of inversion**.\n*   If a material is **centrosymmetric** (meaning it has a point of inversion symmetry, where for any atom at position **r**, there is an identical atom at position -**r**), its bulk χ⁽²⁾ is identically zero due to symmetry constraints.\n*   Therefore, materials that exhibit SPDC, second-harmonic generation (SHG), or other χ⁽²⁾ effects must be **non-centrosymmetric**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Crystal Structure and Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis for the specific material in question.\n*   **Polymorphism:** Unlike graphene, which has a single stable honeycomb structure, boron nanosheets (borophene) are known to be highly polymorphic. This means they can exist in many different atomic arrangements or phases (e.g., β₁₂, χ₃, striped phase, etc.).\n*   **Symmetry of Common Phases:** The most widely synthesized and theoretically stable phases of borophene, such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases that are typically grown on a silver (Ag(111)) substrate, are investigated for their symmetry.\n*   **Analysis of Specific Structures:**\n    *   The **β₁₂-borophene** sheet has a *Pmmn* space group, which is **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   The **χ₃-borophene** sheet has a *Cmcm* space group, which is also **centrosymmetric**.\n*   **Conclusion on Symmetry:** The common, stable, and well-characterized phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess a center of inversion.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize the Findings and Arrive at a Conclusion\n\n1.  SPDC requires a material to be non-centrosymmetric to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  The common and stable forms of boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric.\n3.  Due to their centrosymmetric nature, the bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of these boron nanosheets is zero.\n4.  Therefore, as a direct consequence, these materials are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider (Caveats)\n\n*   **Edges and Defects:** While the bulk 2D crystal is centrosymmetric, symmetry is broken at the edges of the nanosheet or at defect sites. This can lead to a very weak, localized second-order nonlinear response. However, this is not a bulk property and is generally not what is meant when asking if a material *exhibits* a phenomenon like SPDC. The effect would be extremely inefficient compared to true non-centrosymmetric bulk materials.\n*   **Strain or Substrate Effects:** Applying mechanical strain or placing the nanosheet on a particular substrate could potentially break the inversion symmetry and induce a non-zero χ⁽²⁾. However, the question specifies \"free-standing\" nanosheets, removing the substrate effect from consideration. Strain would have to be externally applied.\n*   **Hypothetical Polymorphs:** While the common phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible for less stable, non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of borophene to exist. If such a phase could be synthesized and stabilized in a free-standing form, *that specific phase* could potentially exhibit SPDC. But based on the current state of knowledge for common borophene, the answer is no.\n*   **Higher-Order Processes:** All materials have non-zero third-order susceptibility (χ⁽³⁾). It is possible to have four-wave mixing processes, but this is not SPDC. Also, very weak second-order effects can arise from electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole contributions even in centrosymmetric media, but these are many orders of magnitude weaker than the electric-dipole-allowed χ⁽²⁾ process and are typically negligible.\n\n---\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, free-standing boron nanosheets in their common, stable structural phases would **not** be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is because these structures are centrosymmetric, which dictates that their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), the material property essential for SPDC, is zero.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets in their commonly observed phases would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The primary reason is that this phenomenon requires the material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion (are non-centrosymmetric). The most stable and commonly synthesized phases of borophene (such as β₁₂ and χ₃) are centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero by symmetry. Therefore, they cannot support second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC.>>>"
