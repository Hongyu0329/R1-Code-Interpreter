    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Problem Definition**\nWe are given a linear time-invariant system with state matrix A and input matrix B:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair, `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial for a system with these eigenvalues is:\n`P_desired(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2)`\n`P_desired(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`P_desired(s) = (s + 1 - j)(s + 1 + j)`\nUsing the formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2` where `a = s + 1` and `b = j`:\n`P_desired(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`P_desired(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`P_desired(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n**3. Formulating the Closed-Loop System**\nLet the state feedback gain matrix `F` be a 2x2 matrix (since the state `x` is 2x1 and the input `u` is 2x1 for the control law `u = Fx`):\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNext, we form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2f3, 1 + f2 + 2f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**4. Actual Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is given by `det(sI - M) = s^2 - trace(M)s + det(M)`.\nFor our `A_cl` matrix:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nSo, the actual characteristic polynomial is:\n`P_actual(s) = s^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**5. Equating Polynomials and Solving for F**\nWe match the coefficients of `P_actual(s)` with `P_desired(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n\n*   **Matching the 's' coefficient:**\n    `2 = - (f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1)`\n    `-2 = f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2f3 = -1` (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Matching the constant term:**\n    `2 = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n    `3 = -f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns. This indicates that there are infinite solutions for `F`. This is typical for multi-input systems. We can find a specific solution by setting some of the unknowns to zero.\n\nLet's make a simple choice: `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. The equations simplify to:\n*   Equation 1: `f1 + f2 = -1`\n*   Equation 2: `3 = -f1 - 2*f2`\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations.\nFrom Equation 1, we get `f1 = -1 - f2`.\nSubstitute this into Equation 2:\n`3 = -(-1 - f2) - 2*f2`\n`3 = 1 + f2 - 2*f2`\n`3 = 1 - f2`\n`f2 = 1 - 3`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nNow substitute `f2 = -2` back into the expression for `f1`:\n`f1 = -1 - (-2) = -1 + 2 = 1`\n\nSo, one possible solution for the elements of `F` is `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\nThe state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Non-uniqueness of Solution:** For multi-input systems, the state feedback gain `F` that achieves a desired set of eigenvalues is generally not unique. Any of the infinite solutions would be a correct answer. The method used here (setting some elements of F to zero) is a standard way to find one such solution.\n*   **Controllability:** Pole placement is only possible if the system `(A, B)` is controllable. For this system, the controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]` has rank 2, which equals the dimension of the state, so the system is controllable.\n*   **Sign Convention:** The problem specifies the closed-loop matrix as `A + BF`. In many textbooks, the control law is `u = -Kx`, leading to a closed-loop matrix of `A - BK`. Be mindful of this convention; if `A - BF` were used, the resulting `F` would have the opposite sign.\n*   **Verification:** It is always a good practice to check the final answer. For `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`, the closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`. The characteristic equation is `s(s+2) - (-1)(2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`, which has roots `-1 Â± j`, confirming our result.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
