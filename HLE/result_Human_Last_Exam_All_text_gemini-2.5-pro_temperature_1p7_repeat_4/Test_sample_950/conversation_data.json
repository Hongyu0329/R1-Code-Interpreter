    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Space:** The question asks about the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted by $G(3, 5)$ or $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n    A useful property of Grassmannians is that $G(k, n)$ is diffeomorphic to $G(n-k, n)$. Therefore, $G(3, 5)$ is diffeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$. It is often easier to work with the smaller of the two numbers, so we will analyze the cohomology of $G(2, 5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Object:** We are asked for the **rank** of the **torsion subgroup** of the **integral cohomology ring** $H^*(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   The integral cohomology ring is the graded abelian group $H^*(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, endowed with the cup product.\n    *   The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order. For the graded group $H^*(G; \\mathbb{Z})$, its torsion subgroup is $T = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 \\text{Torsion}(H^i(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n    *   The **rank** of an abelian group $A$ is the dimension of the $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. Equivalently, it is the rank of the free part of $A$ in its decomposition into a free part and a torsion part, according to the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups.\n\n3.  **Careful Point: The Definition of Rank:** By its definition, a torsion group is a group where every element has finite order. Let $T$ be a torsion group. For any element $t \\in T$, there exists a non-zero integer $n$ such that $nt = 0$. When we tensor with $\\mathbb{Q}$, the element $t \\otimes 1$ becomes $t \\otimes 1 = t \\otimes (n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}) = (nt) \\otimes \\frac{1}{n} = 0 \\otimes \\frac{1}{n} = 0$. This means every element in $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ is zero. Consequently, the dimension of the vector space $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ is 0.\n    Therefore, the rank of any torsion group is 0. This suggests that the answer to the question might be 0.\n\n4.  **Verifying Non-Triviality:** This conclusion would be trivial if the torsion subgroup itself were the trivial group {0}. We must check if the integral cohomology of $G(2,5)$ actually has torsion. Unlike complex Grassmannians, which have torsion-free cohomology, real Grassmannians can have 2-torsion.\n\n5.  **Computing the Cohomology Groups:** The calculation of the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is a classic, but non-trivial, result in algebraic topology. The standard method is to first compute the integral homology groups $H_*(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ and then use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology.\n    The integral homology groups of $G(2, 5)$ are (from established sources, e.g., the work of S. S. O or from cellular homology computations):\n    *   $H_0(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H_1(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (where $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$)\n    *   $H_2(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H_3(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$\n    *   $H_4(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H_5(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H_6(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$\n\n6.  **Applying the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT):** The UCT states that for a space $X$ with finitely generated homology groups, there is a (split) short exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to \\text{Ext}(H_{i-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$.\n    For finitely generated groups, this simplifies to $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Free}(H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z})) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H_{i-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n    Let's apply this to $G = G(2, 5)$:\n    *   $H^0(G; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Free}(H_0) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H_{-1}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^1(G; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Free}(H_1) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H_0) = \\text{Free}(\\mathbb{Z}_2) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0 \\oplus 0 = 0$\n    *   $H^2(G; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Free}(H_2) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H_1) = \\text{Free}(\\mathbb{Z}_2) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H^3(G; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Free}(H_3) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H_2) = \\text{Free}(0) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H^4(G; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Free}(H_4) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H_3) = \\text{Free}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(0) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^5(G; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Free}(H_5) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H_4) = \\text{Free}(\\mathbb{Z}_2) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0 \\oplus 0 = 0$\n    *   $H^6(G; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Free}(H_6) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H_5) = \\text{Free}(0) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\n7.  **Identify the Torsion Subgroup:** The torsion subgroup of the whole cohomology ring $H^*(G; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the direct sum of the torsion parts of the individual cohomology groups:\n    $T = \\text{Torsion}(H^*(G; \\mathbb{Z})) = H^2 \\oplus H^3 \\oplus H^6 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    So, the torsion subgroup is non-trivial; it is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion on Rank:** We are asked for the rank of the group $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$. As established in Step 3, the rank of any torsion group is 0 according to the standard definition in algebra and algebraic topology. Although in other contexts (like finite group theory) \"rank\" might refer to the minimum number of generators (which would be 3 here), the setting of the problem (cohomology rings) strongly implies the standard definition must be used.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the group $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe rank of an abelian group is the rank of its free part.\nSince $T$ is a torsion group, its free part is the trivial group {0}.\nThe rank of the trivial group is 0.\nTherefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
