    "Answering this question requires understanding the theory of decoupling for curves, a topic in modern harmonic analysis. The main result in this area, due to Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth, provides the sharp decoupling exponents for non-degenerate curves.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Decoupling Inequality and the Exponent\n\nLet $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a curve. The $l^2$ decoupling inequality concerns functions $f$ whose Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}$, is supported in a small neighborhood of the curve.\n\nLet $\\delta > 0$ be a small parameter. We partition the interval $[0,1]$ into $N \\approx \\delta^{-1}$ intervals $I$ of length $\\delta$. Let $\\Gamma_I = \\gamma(I)$ be the corresponding segment of the curve. We can decompose the function $f$ as a sum $f = \\sum_I f_I$, where the Fourier transform of each $f_I$ is supported in a small \"cap\" or neighborhood around $\\Gamma_I$.\n\nThe $l^2$ decoupling inequality is an estimate of the form:\n$$ \\|f\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)} \\leq C \\cdot (\\delta^{-1})^{\\alpha} \\left( \\sum_I \\|f_I\\|_{L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)}^2 \\right)^{1/2} $$\nThe question asks for the **sharp exponent** $\\alpha$. This exponent, denoted $\\alpha_n(p)$, depends on the dimension of the ambient space, $n$, and the Lebesgue exponent, $p$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Properties of the Given Curve\n\nThe curve is given by $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. This is a segment of a helix in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so the ambient dimension is $n=3$.\n\nThe key property of the curve that determines the decoupling exponent is its **non-degeneracy**. A curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is called non-degenerate if its first $n-1$ derivatives are linearly independent. For our curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ ($n=3$), we need to check if the vectors $\\gamma'(t)$ and $\\gamma''(t)$ are linearly independent.\n\nLet's compute the derivatives:\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n\nTo check for linear independence, we can form a matrix with these vectors and check its rank.\n$$ M(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin t & \\cos t & 1 \\\\ -\\cos t & -\\sin t & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe vectors are linearly independent if this matrix has rank 2. We can check this by finding a $2 \\times 2$ submatrix with a non-zero determinant. Let's take the first two columns:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin t & \\cos t \\\\ -\\cos t & -\\sin t \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\sin t)(-\\sin t) - (\\cos t)(-\\cos t) = \\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1 $$\nSince the determinant is 1 (and thus non-zero) for all $t$, the vectors $\\gamma'(t)$ and $\\gamma''(t)$ are linearly independent. Therefore, the curve is **non-degenerate**.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Bourgain-Demeter-Guth Theorem\n\nThe celebrated theorem of Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth provides the sharp decoupling exponent for any non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The theorem states that for $2 \\le p \\le n(n+1)$, the sharp exponent $\\alpha_n(p)$ is given by:\n$$ \\alpha_n(p) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{p} \\right) $$\nFor $p > n(n+1)$, the sharp exponent is $\\alpha_n(p) = 0$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine \"The\" Decoupling Exponent\n\nThe question asks for \"the\" sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent, implying a single numerical value, not a function of $p$. In the context of decoupling theory, this typically refers to the exponent at the critical endpoint of the range, $p = n(n+1)$. This value is the most difficult to prove and it determines the exponents for the entire range $2 \\le p \\le n(n+1)$ via interpolation with the trivial case at $p=2$.\n\nFor our problem, $n=3$, so the critical exponent is $p = 3(3+1) = 12$. We need to calculate $\\alpha_3(12)$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nUsing the formula with $n=3$ and $p=12$:\n$$ \\alpha_3(12) = \\frac{3(3-1)}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{12} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha_3(12) = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{4} \\left( \\frac{6}{12} - \\frac{1}{12} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha_3(12) = \\frac{6}{4} \\left( \\frac{5}{12} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha_3(12) = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{12} = \\frac{15}{24} $$\nFinally, we simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{15}{24} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{3 \\times 8} = \\frac{5}{8} $$\n\nThus, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the given curve is $5/8$.\n\n<<<5/8>>>"
