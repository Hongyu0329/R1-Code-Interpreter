    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the Grigorchuk group (let's call it G) and its relationship with finite groups, particularly subgroups of the symmetric group S₄.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Subgroups and Homomorphisms**\n\nA fundamental result in group theory establishes a connection between the subgroups of a group G and its homomorphisms to symmetric groups. The number of subgroups of index n in G is equal to the number of equivalence classes of transitive group actions of G on a set of n elements. Each such action is defined by a homomorphism φ: G → Sₙ whose image, Im(φ), is a transitive subgroup of Sₙ.\n\nFor this problem, we are looking for subgroups of index 4. Thus, we need to analyze the transitive homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group G to the symmetric group S₄.\n\n**2. Properties of the Grigorchuk Group (G)**\n\nThe Grigorchuk group G has several key properties relevant to this problem:\n*   It is generated by four involutions (elements of order 2), typically denoted {a, b, c, d}.\n*   It is an infinite, residually finite 2-group. This means that for any element g ≠ 1 in G, there exists a finite 2-group Q and a homomorphism φ: G → Q such that φ(g) ≠ 1. A crucial consequence is that any finite quotient of G must be a 2-group (a group whose elements all have order a power of 2).\n\n**3. Transitive Subgroups of S₄**\n\nWe need to identify the transitive subgroups of S₄. A subgroup T ≤ Sₙ is transitive if its order |T| is a multiple of n. For S₄, transitive subgroups must have order divisible by 4. The conjugacy classes of transitive subgroups of S₄ are:\n*   **C₄**: The cyclic group of order 4 (generated by a 4-cycle).\n*   **V₄**: The Klein four-group, isomorphic to Z₂ × Z₂ (consists of the identity and three double-transpositions).\n*   **D₄**: The dihedral group of order 8 (the symmetry group of a square).\n*   **A₄**: The alternating group of order 12.\n*   **S₄**: The full symmetric group of order 24.\n\n**4. Feasible Homomorphic Images**\n\nSince G is a 2-group, any homomorphic image of G must also be a 2-group. This significantly narrows down the possible transitive images in S₄:\n*   A₄ (order 12) and S₄ (order 24) are not 2-groups, so they cannot be images of G.\n*   C₄, V₄, and D₄ are 2-groups, so they are potential images.\n\nLet's analyze these three possibilities:\n\n*   **Image C₄**: The group C₄ is abelian. Any homomorphism φ: G → C₄ must factor through the abelianization of G, which is G_ab = G/G' (where G' is the commutator subgroup). It is a well-known property that the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is G_ab ≅ (Z/2)³. Can we have a surjective homomorphism from (Z/2)³ to C₄ ≅ Z₄? No, because every element in the image of (Z/2)³ must have an order that divides 2, while Z₄ has an element of order 4. Thus, there are no epimorphisms (surjective homomorphisms) from G to C₄.\n\n*   **Image V₄**: The group V₄ is abelian (V₄ ≅ Z₂ × Z₂). Homomorphisms from G to V₄ factor through G_ab ≅ (Z/2)³. We can certainly find surjective homomorphisms from (Z/2)³ to (Z/2)². These correspond to actions of G on 4 points where the image is V₄. The corresponding subgroups are normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n*   **Image D₄**: The group D₄ is a non-abelian 2-group of order 8. A result by L. Bartholdi (\"A Wilson group of non-uniformly exponential growth\", C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003) states that the Grigorchuk group G has no quotient isomorphic to the dihedral group D₄. This means there are no surjective homomorphisms from G to D₄. Therefore, D₄ cannot be the image of a transitive action of G.\n\n**5. Counting the Subgroups**\n\nBased on the analysis above, any transitive action of G on 4 points must have an image isomorphic to V₄. Let H be a subgroup of index 4 in G. The action of G on the set of left cosets G/H is transitive. The kernel of this action, Core(H) = ⋂_{g∈G} gHg⁻¹, is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in H. The quotient G/Core(H) is isomorphic to the image of the action, which must be V₄.\n\nSo, G/Core(H) ≅ V₄. Since |V₄| = 4 and [G:H] = 4, we have [G:Core(H)] = 4. This implies H = Core(H). Therefore, any subgroup of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group must be a normal subgroup.\n\nThe task is now reduced to counting the number of normal subgroups of index 4 in G. A normal subgroup H of index 4 means G/H is a group of order 4. Since G cannot have a Z₄ quotient, G/H must be isomorphic to V₄.\n\nWe need to count the number of normal subgroups H in G such that G/H ≅ V₄. This is equivalent to counting the number of epimorphisms φ: G → V₄, divided by the number of automorphisms of V₄.\n\n*   Number of epimorphisms: Since V₄ is abelian, these epimorphisms factor through G_ab = (Z/2)³. We need to count the epimorphisms φ: (Z/2)³ → (Z/2)².\n    *   (Z/2)³ is a 3-dimensional vector space over the field F₂, and (Z/2)² is a 2-dimensional vector space. We are counting surjective linear maps.\n    *   Total number of linear maps: A map is determined by where it sends the 3 basis vectors of (Z/2)³. Each can go to any of the 4 vectors in (Z/2)², so there are 4³ = 64 total maps.\n    *   Non-surjective maps: A map is not surjective if its image is a proper subspace of (Z/2)². The proper subspaces are the zero-subspace ({0}) and three 1-dimensional subspaces (lines).\n        *   Maps to the zero-subspace: Only the zero map (1 map).\n        *   Maps to a 1-D subspace L: L has 2 elements. For a fixed L, there are 2³ = 8 maps from (Z/2)³ to L. One of them is the zero map. So there are 7 maps whose image is exactly L. Since there are 3 such subspaces L, there are 3 × 7 = 21 such maps.\n    *   Total non-surjective maps = 1 + 21 = 22.\n    *   Total surjective maps (epimorphisms) = 64 - 22 = 42.\n\n*   Number of automorphisms of V₄: Aut(V₄) ≅ Aut((Z/2)²) ≅ GL(2, F₂). The order of this group is (2² - 1)(2² - 2) = 3 × 2 = 6.\n\n*   Number of subgroups: The number of normal subgroups H with G/H ≅ V₄ is |Epi(G, V₄)| / |Aut(V₄)| = 42 / 6 = 7.\n\nSince all subgroups of index 4 must be normal with quotient V₄, this is the total number.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1. Subgroups of index 4 in G correspond to transitive G-actions on 4 points, i.e., homomorphisms G → S₄ with a transitive image.\n2. Since G is a 2-group, the image must be a transitive 2-subgroup of S₄. These are C₄, V₄, and D₄.\n3. G has no C₄ or D₄ quotients.\n4. Therefore, the image of any such action must be V₄.\n5. An action with image V₄ corresponds to a normal subgroup of index 4.\n6. The number of such subgroups equals the number of epimorphisms from G to V₄, divided by |Aut(V₄)|.\n7. Calculation yields |Epi(G,V₄)| = 42 and |Aut(V₄)| = 6.\n8. The number of subgroups is 42/6 = 7.\n\n>>>7"
