    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a gas of light quanta (photons), derived using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically mentioning the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **Step 1: The Large Deviation Principle in Statistical Mechanics**\n\nLarge deviation theory (LDT) provides a framework for understanding why macroscopic systems settle into an equilibrium state. The core idea is that out of all possible microscopic configurations, the ones corresponding to the equilibrium macroscopic state are overwhelmingly more numerous.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem can be seen as a formal statement of Boltzmann's principle of entropy. It relates the probability of observing a particular empirical distribution of particles over states to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from a reference distribution. In statistical mechanics, this becomes the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**: the equilibrium distribution of particles over energy levels is the one that maximizes the system's entropy, subject to macroscopic constraints (like fixed total energy).\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with the probability of the sample mean of random variables deviating from its expected value. In the context of a canonical ensemble (a system in contact with a heat bath at temperature T), the total energy is a fluctuating quantity. The Cramer-Chernoff principle implies that the probability of observing a mean energy different from the equilibrium value is exponentially small. The rate of this decay is governed by the free energy. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes this free energy, which is equivalent to maximizing entropy at a fixed temperature.\n\nWe will use these principles to derive the properties of a photon gas.\n\n### **Step 2: Entropy of a Bose Gas**\n\nA photon gas is a system of bosons. To find the equilibrium state, we first need the expression for the entropy of a configuration of bosons.\n\nA microstate is specified by the occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$ for each single-particle quantum state $i$ with energy $\\epsilon_i$. For indistinguishable bosons, the number of ways to achieve a configuration $\\{n_i\\}$ is given by Bose-Einstein statistics. The entropy for this configuration is $S = k_B \\log \\Omega(\\{n_i\\})$, where $\\Omega$ is the number of microstates.\n\nUsing Stirling's approximation, the entropy functional to be maximized can be written in terms of the average occupation number $\\langle n_i \\rangle$ of a state $i$:\n$S[\\{\\langle n_i \\rangle\\}] = k_B \\sum_{i} \\left[ (1+\\langle n_i \\rangle) \\log(1+\\langle n_i \\rangle) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\log\\langle n_i \\rangle \\right]$\n\n### **Step 3: Constraints for a Photon Gas**\n\nWe maximize this entropy functional subject to the macroscopic constraints of the system.\n1.  **Constant Mean Energy:** The total mean energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ is fixed: $\\sum_i \\langle n_i \\rangle \\epsilon_i = \\langle E \\rangle$.\n2.  **Non-conserved Particle Number:** A crucial property of a photon gas is that photons can be created and absorbed (e.g., by the walls of the container). This means the total number of particles is not conserved. In the language of statistical mechanics, this corresponds to setting the **chemical potential, $\\mu$, to zero**.\n\n### **Step 4: Maximization and the Planck Distribution**\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S$ subject to the energy constraint. We aim to maximize:\n$J = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left( \\sum_i \\langle n_i \\rangle \\epsilon_i - \\langle E \\rangle \\right)$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint. Differentiating with respect to $\\langle n_i \\rangle$ and setting to zero gives:\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\langle n_i \\rangle} \\left[ (1+\\langle n_i \\rangle) \\log(1+\\langle n_i \\rangle) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\log\\langle n_i \\rangle - \\beta \\langle n_i \\rangle \\epsilon_i \\right] = 0$\n$\\log(1+\\langle n_i \\rangle) - \\log(\\langle n_i \\rangle) - \\beta \\epsilon_i = 0$\n$\\log \\left( \\frac{1+\\langle n_i \\rangle}{\\langle n_i \\rangle} \\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_i$\n$\\frac{1}{\\langle n_i \\rangle} + 1 = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i}$\nThis yields the equilibrium mean occupation number for a state with energy $\\epsilon_i$:\n$\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\nThis is the celebrated **Planck distribution**. The Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n### **Step 5: Density of States for Photons**\n\nTo find the total energy and entropy, we must sum over all possible states. For a macroscopic system, the energy levels are so closely spaced that we can treat them as a continuum. We convert the sum to an integral using the density of states, $g(\\epsilon)$, which is the number of states per unit energy interval. For photons in a 3D box of volume $V$ (including two polarization states), the density of states is:\n$g(\\epsilon) = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\epsilon^2$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### **Step 6: Calculation of the Equilibrium Mean Energy, $\\langle E \\rangle$**\n\nThe total mean energy is found by integrating the energy of each state multiplied by its mean occupation number over the density of states:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\left(\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3}\\right) d\\epsilon$\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\nWe solve this integral by substituting $x = \\beta \\epsilon$:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, with $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\nSubstituting this value back gives the equilibrium mean energy:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{15 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^4}$\nIn terms of temperature $T = 1/(k_B \\beta)$:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\nThis is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy of blackbody radiation.\n\n### **Step 7: Calculation of the Equilibrium Entropy, S**\n\nThe entropy can be calculated using the thermodynamic relation $S = (\\langle E \\rangle - F)/T$, where $F = -k_B T \\log Z$ is the Helmholtz free energy and $Z$ is the partition function. The logarithm of the total partition function is:\n$\\log Z = -\\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon = -\\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^2 \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\nIntegrating by parts yields:\n$\\log Z = \\frac{V \\pi^2}{45 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^3} = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^3}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\nNow, we can find the entropy:\n$S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T} - \\frac{F}{T} = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T} + k_B \\log Z$\n$S = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4 T^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} \\right) + k_B \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^3 T^3}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} \\right)$\n$S = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4 T^3}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} + \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n$S = \\left(\\frac{3}{45} + \\frac{1}{45}\\right) \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4 T^3}{(\\hbar c)^3} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\nIt is useful to note the simple relationship between the entropy and mean energy of a photon gas: $S = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T}$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium values for a photon gas, derived from the principles of maximum entropy (Boltzmann-Sanov) and consistent with the framework of canonical fluctuations (Cramer-Chernoff), are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} V T^4$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n$S = \\frac{4\\pi^2 k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} V T^3$\n\nHere, $V$ is the volume, $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<The equilibrium mean energy is $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} V T^4$ and the equilibrium entropy is $S = \\frac{4\\pi^2 k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} V T^3$.>>>"
