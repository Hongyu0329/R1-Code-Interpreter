The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from its Quality Control (QC) test because the test itself was poorly designed. The evidence was that the control plate for Batch 3 showed "no growth" of the test bacterium, *Bacillus subtilis*. The lab incorrectly interpreted this as proof that the chloramphenicol antibiotic was working.

The actual reason for the "no growth" result on the Batch 3 QC plate was that Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) has an acidic pH (around 5.6) that is not suitable for the growth of *Bacillus subtilis*. The bacterium failed to grow due to the hostile pH of the medium itself, not because of the antibiotic (which had been destroyed by autoclaving in Batch 3). The laboratory confused inhibition caused by the medium's pH with inhibition caused by the antibiotic, leading them to falsely conclude that Batch 3 was free of viable bacteria and safe to use.
