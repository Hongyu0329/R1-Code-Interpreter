    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n*   **Wallpaper Group:** A wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repeating pattern. There are 17 distinct wallpaper groups.\n*   **Point Group:** For a given wallpaper group, the point group is the set of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed, when translations are ignored. These are also known as 2D crystallographic point groups.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements (i.e., symmetry operations) it contains.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose associated point group has exactly two elements.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the 2D crystallographic point groups of order 2\nThe possible symmetry operations in a 2D crystallographic point group are rotations of order 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and reflections. Let's list the 10 possible 2D point groups and their orders:\n\n| Point Group (Hermann-Mauguin) | Point Group (Schönflies) | Order | Description of Operations                                |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1                             | $C_1$                    | 1     | Identity only                                            |\n| **2**                         | **$C_2$**                | **2** | Identity, 180° rotation                                  |\n| **m**                         | **$C_s$**                | **2** | Identity, reflection across a line                       |\n| 3                             | $C_3$                    | 3     | Identity, 120° and 240° rotations                        |\n| 4                             | $C_4$                    | 4     | Rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°                         |\n| 2mm                           | $C_{2v}$                 | 4     | 180° rotation and two reflections                        |\n| 6                             | $C_6$                    | 6     | Rotations by multiples of 60°                            |\n| 3m                            | $C_{3v}$                 | 6     | 120° rotations and three reflections                     |\n| 4mm                           | $C_{4v}$                 | 8     | 90° rotations and four reflections                       |\n| 6mm                           | $C_{6v}$                 | 12    | 60° rotations and six reflections                        |\n\nFrom this table, we can see that there are two point groups of order 2: **2** (or $C_2$) and **m** (or $C_s$).\n\n### Step 3: Find the wallpaper groups associated with these point groups\nNow, we must examine the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones correspond to the point groups **2** and **m**. The point group of a wallpaper group can be determined from its Hermann-Mauguin notation. A key point is that glide reflections (denoted by 'g') in a wallpaper group become simple reflections ('m') in the corresponding point group, because translations are factored out.\n\n1.  **Wallpaper groups with point group 2 ($C_2$)**:\n    This point group has only a 180° rotation center.\n    *   **p2**: This group is defined by a primitive lattice with 2-fold rotation centers. Its point group is **2**.\n\n2.  **Wallpaper groups with point group m ($C_s$)**:\n    This point group has only reflection symmetry. Wallpaper groups with reflections ('m') or glide reflections ('g') will have this point group, provided they do not have any rotational symmetry (other than the trivial 360°).\n    *   **pm**: This group has parallel lines of reflection. Its point group is **m**.\n    *   **pg**: This group has parallel glide-reflection lines. Since a glide reflection becomes a simple reflection in the point group, the point group for pg is also **m**.\n    *   **cm**: This group has a centered lattice with parallel reflection lines. Its point group is **m**.\n\n### Step 4: Count the wallpaper groups\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, the wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are:\n\n*   **p2** (with point group 2)\n*   **pm** (with point group m)\n*   **pg** (with point group m)\n*   **cm** (with point group m)\n\nCounting these groups, we find there are a total of 4.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 4 wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2. They are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
