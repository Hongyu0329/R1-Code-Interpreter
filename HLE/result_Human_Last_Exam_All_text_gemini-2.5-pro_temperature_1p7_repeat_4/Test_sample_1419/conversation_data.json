    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Theory and the Goal\n\nThe problem concerns the scalar field theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction, described by the Euclidean Lagrangian density in $D$ dimensions:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\mu \\phi_0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_0^2 \\phi_0^2 + \\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi_0^4 $$\nwhere $\\phi_0, m_0, u_0$ are the bare field, mass, and coupling constant, respectively.\n\nWe analyze this theory near its upper critical dimension, which is $D=4$. We use dimensional regularization and set $D = 4 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small, positive parameter. In $D$ dimensions, the coupling constant $u_0$ has a mass dimension of $[u_0] = 4 - D = \\epsilon$. To work with a dimensionless renormalized coupling constant, $u$, we introduce a renormalization mass scale $\\mu$ and relate the bare coupling to the renormalized one:\n$$ u_0 = \\mu^{\\epsilon} Z_u u $$\nHere, $Z_u$ is the coupling renormalization constant, which must be chosen to absorb the ultraviolet (UV) divergences of the theory.\n\nThe goal is to find the fixed point coupling $u^*$. A fixed point is a value of the coupling that is scale-invariant, meaning it does not change as we vary the energy scale $\\mu$. This condition is expressed by the vanishing of the beta function:\n$$ \\beta(u^*) = \\frac{d u}{d \\ln \\mu} \\bigg|_{u=u^*} = 0 $$\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Beta Function $\\beta(u)$\n\nThe beta function is derived from the fact that the bare coupling $u_0$ is, by definition, independent of the chosen renormalization scale $\\mu$. Differentiating the relation for $u_0$ with respect to $\\ln\\mu$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{d u_0}{d \\ln \\mu} = \\frac{d}{d \\ln \\mu} (\\mu^{\\epsilon} Z_u u) = \\epsilon \\mu^{\\epsilon} Z_u u + \\mu^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d(Z_u u)}{d \\ln \\mu} $$\nUsing the chain rule and the definition of $\\beta(u)$, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{d(Z_u u)}{d \\ln \\mu} = \\frac{d(Z_u u)}{du} \\frac{du}{d \\ln \\mu} = \\left( Z_u + u \\frac{dZ_u}{du} \\right) \\beta(u) $$\nSubstituting this back into the equation gives:\n$$ 0 = \\epsilon u Z_u + \\left( Z_u + u \\frac{dZ_u}{du} \\right) \\beta(u) $$\nSolving for the beta function, we get:\n$$ \\beta(u) = - \\epsilon u \\frac{Z_u}{Z_u + u \\frac{dZ_u}{du}} $$\nTo find the beta function to the lowest non-trivial order in $u$, we need to calculate the renormalization constant $Z_u$ up to one-loop order.\n\n### Step 3: One-Loop Calculation of the Renormalization Constant $Z_u$\n\nThe renormalization constant $Z_u$ is determined by canceling the UV divergences in the four-point vertex function, $\\Gamma^{(4)}$. In $\\phi^4$ theory, the field renormalization constant $Z_\\phi$ has no one-loop correction ($Z_\\phi = 1 + O(u^2)$), so we can ignore it at this order.\n\nThe one-loop correction to the four-point vertex function comes from three Feynman diagrams (the s, t, and u channels), which are topologically identical. The calculation is done in $D=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions. Summing the three diagrams, the divergent part of the one-loop correction to the vertex function is:\n$$ \\delta\\Gamma^{(4)}_\\text{div} = \\frac{3 u^2}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} $$\nIn the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme, the counterterm part of the Lagrangian, $\\delta_u$, is chosen to cancel precisely this pole term. The renormalized vertex function is made finite by relating the bare and renormalized couplings. The bare vertex function, to one-loop order, contains both the bare coupling term and the loop correction:\n$$ \\Gamma^{(4)}_\\text{bare} = -u_0 + \\frac{3 u_0^2}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} + \\text{finite terms} $$\nReplacing $u_0$ with its expression in terms of the renormalized coupling, $u_0 = \\mu^\\epsilon u Z_u = \\mu^\\epsilon u (1 + \\delta_u)$, we have:\n$$ \\Gamma^{(4)}_\\text{bare} = -\\mu^\\epsilon u (1+\\delta_u) + \\frac{3 (\\mu^\\epsilon u)^2}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} + O(u^3) $$\nFor the vertex function to be finite as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the divergent terms must cancel. In the MS scheme, $\\delta_u$ is a power series in $u$ whose coefficients are pure poles in $\\epsilon$. To cancel the divergence at order $u^2$, we must choose $\\delta_u$ such that:\n$$ -\\mu^\\epsilon u \\delta_u + \\frac{3 (\\mu^\\epsilon u)^2}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} \\implies \\delta_u = \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} $$\nSo, the one-loop renormalization constant is:\n$$ Z_u = 1 + \\delta_u = 1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} + O(u^2) $$\n\nNow we can calculate the beta function. From the expression for $Z_u$, we find its derivative:\n$$ \\frac{dZ_u}{du} = \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} + O(u) $$\nPlugging $Z_u$ and its derivative into the formula for $\\beta(u)$ and expanding for small $u$ (keeping in mind that the fixed point value $u^*$ will be of order $\\epsilon$, so $u/\\epsilon$ is of order 1):\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u \\frac{1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}}{1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} + u(\\frac{3}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon})} = -\\epsilon u \\frac{1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}}{1 + \\frac{6u}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}} $$\nExpanding this expression for small $u$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u \\left(1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{6u}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} + \\dots\\right) \\approx -\\epsilon u \\left(1 - \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}\\right) $$\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(u^3) $$\nThis is the celebrated one-loop beta function for $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Fixed Point Coupling $u^*$\n\nThe fixed point $u^*$ is the non-trivial solution to $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $u^*$:\n$$ u^* \\left( -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions. One is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, $u^*=0$. The other is the non-trivial interacting fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We find it by setting the term in the parenthesis to zero:\n$$ -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\nSolving for $u^*$ gives:\n$$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon $$\nThis expression for $u^*$ is the leading order result. Since $u^*$ is proportional to $\\epsilon$, any higher-order terms in the beta function (e.g., of order $u^3$) would contribute corrections to $u^*$ that are of order $\\epsilon^2$ and higher. Therefore, this is the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling."
