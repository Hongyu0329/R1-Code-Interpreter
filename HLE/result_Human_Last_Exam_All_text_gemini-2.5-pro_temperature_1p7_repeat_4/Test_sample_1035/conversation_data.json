    "An analysis of the question step by step, including careful points, is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35\".\n\n*   **\\(K_n\\)**: This is the complete graph on \\(n\\) vertices, where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. For this problem, \\(n=35\\), so we are dealing with \\(K_{35}\\).\n*   **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, say \\(U\\) and \\(W\\), such that every edge connects a vertex in \\(U\\) to one in \\(W\\). No two vertices within the same set are adjacent.\n*   **Family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges**: This means we have a collection of bipartite graphs, let's call them \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k\\). The union of the edge sets of these graphs, \\(E(B_1) \\cup E(B_2) \\cup \\ldots \\cup E(B_k)\\), must contain all the edges of \\(K_{35}\\).\n*   **Minimum number of vertices in a family**: This part of the question is ambiguously phrased. In the context of this classic graph theory problem, it is overwhelmingly likely a misphrasing for the \"minimum number of **graphs** in the family\". If it literally meant the sum of vertices of the graphs, the problem becomes ill-defined or trivial. The standard problem, often called finding the *bipartite dimension*, is to find the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs needed to cover a graph. We will proceed under this standard interpretation. So, the question is to find the minimum possible value of \\(k\\).\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Mathematical Principle**\nThis problem is solved by a fundamental theorem in extremal graph theory, often attributed to Noga Alon (related to earlier work by Graham and Pollak).\n\n**Theorem**: If the edges of a complete graph \\(K_n\\) are covered by \\(k\\) bipartite graphs, then \\(n \\le 2^k\\).\n\n**Justification of the Theorem (Proof Idea)**:\n*   Let the vertices of \\(K_n\\) be \\(V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\}\\).\n*   Let the \\(k\\) bipartite graphs that cover \\(K_n\\) be \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k\\). For each graph \\(B_i\\), its vertex set \\(V\\) can be partitioned into two sets, let's call them \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\).\n*   We can assign a unique \"address\" or signature to each vertex \\(v \\in V\\). This signature will be a binary vector of length \\(k\\). For a vertex \\(v\\), we define its signature vector \\(s(v) = (c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k)\\) where \\(c_i = 0\\) if \\(v \\in X_i\\) and \\(c_i = 1\\) if \\(v \\in Y_i\\).\n*   Now, consider any two distinct vertices, say \\(v_a\\) and \\(v_b\\). Since they are vertices in a complete graph, the edge \\((v_a, v_b)\\) exists in \\(K_n\\).\n*   Because our family of bipartite graphs covers all edges, the edge \\((v_a, v_b)\\) must be in at least one of them, say \\(B_j\\).\n*   By the definition of a bipartite graph, if the edge \\((v_a, v_b)\\) is in \\(B_j\\), one vertex must be in the partition \\(X_j\\) and the other in \\(Y_j\\).\n*   This means their corresponding coordinates in the signature vector must be different. That is, \\(s(v_a)_j \\ne s(v_b)_j\\).\n*   Consequently, the entire signature vectors must be different: \\(s(v_a) \\ne s(v_b)\\).\n*   This logic applies to any pair of distinct vertices. Therefore, all \\(n\\) vertices of \\(K_n\\) must be assigned distinct signature vectors.\n*   The signature vectors are binary vectors of length \\(k\\). The total number of unique binary vectors of length \\(k\\) is \\(2^k\\).\n*   Since we need \\(n\\) distinct vectors, the number of available vectors must be at least \\(n\\). So, we must have \\(n \\le 2^k\\).\n\n**3. Apply the Principle to Solve the Problem**\nWe need to find the smallest integer \\(k\\) that satisfies the inequality \\(n \\le 2^k\\) for \\(n=35\\).\n\n*   Inequality: \\(35 \\le 2^k\\)\n*   To find the smallest integer \\(k\\), we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides: \\(\\log_2(35) \\le k\\).\n*   Since \\(k\\) must be an integer, we are looking for \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2(35) \\rceil\\).\n*   Let's check the powers of 2:\n    *   \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n    *   \\(2^5 = 32\\)\n    *   \\(2^6 = 64\\)\n*   We see that \\(2^5 = 32\\), which is less than 35. So, \\(k=5\\) is not enough.\n*   The next power, \\(2^6 = 64\\), is greater than 35. So, \\(k=6\\) is sufficient.\n*   Therefore, the minimum integer value for \\(k\\) is 6.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Question**: The main point of caution is correctly interpreting the ambiguously phrased question. As analyzed, \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" is almost certainly a mistake for \"minimum number of graphs in a family\".\n2.  **Covering vs. Partitioning**: This problem is about *covering*, where an edge can belong to multiple bipartite graphs. This is different from *partitioning* (or decomposition), where each edge must belong to exactly one graph. The theorem for partitioning is different and gives a lower bound of \\(n-1\\), which would be much larger.\n3.  **Lower Bound is Achievable**: The theorem gives a lower bound \\(k \\ge \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\). It is important to know that this bound is tight, meaning a covering with exactly \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) graphs can always be constructed. Thus, the minimum value is exactly this bound.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The problem asks for the minimum number of bipartite graphs, \\(k\\), required to cover all edges of \\(K_{35}\\).\n2.  The governing principle is the inequality \\(n \\le 2^k\\).\n3.  Substitute \\(n=35\\): \\(35 \\le 2^k\\).\n4.  Find the smallest integer \\(k\\) that satisfies this.\n5.  Check powers of 2: \\(2^5 = 32 < 35\\); \\(2^6 = 64 \\ge 35\\).\n6.  The minimum integer \\(k\\) is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
