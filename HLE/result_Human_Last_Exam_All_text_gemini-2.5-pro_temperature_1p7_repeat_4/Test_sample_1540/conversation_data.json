    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory used.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary task is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two input strings.\n2.  **Input Specifications:**\n    *   Two strings are provided as input on two separate lines.\n    *   The strings are guaranteed to have the same length.\n    *   The length of each string is between 1 and 100 characters.\n    *   The strings consist only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n3.  **Comparison Logic:**\n    *   Lexicographical comparison means comparing the strings character by character from left to right.\n    *   \"Case-insensitive\" means that an uppercase letter and its corresponding lowercase letter are treated as equal (e.g., 'a' is equivalent to 'A').\n    *   The comparison ends at the first position `i` where the characters differ. The result of comparing the strings is determined by the result of comparing the characters at this position `i`.\n    *   If all characters are identical (case-insensitively), the strings are considered equal.\n4.  **Output Requirements:**\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Memory Efficiency:** The prompt explicitly asks for the solution that uses the minimum amount of memory for its variables. This is the main optimization goal.\n*   **Case Conversion:** A standard function like `tolower()` from the `<ctype.h>` library is ideal for handling the case-insensitive comparison. It correctly converts uppercase letters to lowercase while leaving other characters (including lowercase letters) unchanged.\n*   **Input Handling:** Standard input is a stream. When we read the first string using a function like `scanf(\"%s\", ...)`, it stops at the first whitespace character, which is the newline (`\\n`) at the end of the first line. This newline character remains in the input buffer and must be handled before reading the second string, especially if we read it character by character.\n*   **Variable Sizing:** To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible data type for each variable that can safely hold the required range of values. For example, a loop counter that only goes up to 100 can be stored in a `char` or `unsigned char` (1 byte) instead of an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Derivation\n\nTo find the most memory-efficient solution, we evaluate different strategies for handling the input strings.\n\n**Strategy 1: Naive Two-Buffer Approach**\nThe most straightforward method is to declare two character arrays, read both strings into them, and then iterate through the arrays to compare.\n*   `char s1[101];` // 100 chars + 1 null terminator = 101 bytes\n*   `char s2[101];` // 100 chars + 1 null terminator = 101 bytes\n*   `int i;` // Loop index = 4 bytes\n*   **Total Memory:** 101 + 101 + 4 = 206 bytes.\n\n**Strategy 2: Optimized Single-Buffer Approach**\nWe can reduce memory usage by not storing the second string. Standard input is a one-way stream. To compare `string1[i]` with `string2[i]`, we need `string1[i]` available when we read `string2[i]`. This means we *must* store the first string. However, we can process the second string character by character as it's being read, comparing it on the fly with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n\nThis leads to the most memory-efficient design:\n1.  Store the first string in a buffer.\n2.  Read the second string one character at a time from standard input.\n3.  As each character of the second string is read, compare it against the character at the same position in the first string's buffer.\n\n**Calculating Memory for the Optimal Solution**\n\nLet's identify the exact variables needed for this single-buffer approach and choose their most space-efficient types.\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:** We need to store the first string, which has a maximum length of 100. A character array requires an extra byte for the null terminator.\n    *   Variable: `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Variable for reading the second string:** We'll read the second string using `getchar()`. The `getchar()` function returns an `int` so it can represent every possible `char` value as well as the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) marker. Therefore, the variable that stores its return value must be an `int`.\n    *   Variable: `int c;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**. (Using the common size for `int` on competitive programming platforms).\n\n3.  **Loop Index:** We need an index to access characters in the `s1` buffer corresponding to the characters being read from the second string. This index will run from 0 to at most 99. The `unsigned char` type, which can store values from 0 to 255 in a single byte, is perfect for this.\n    *   Variable: `unsigned char i;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n4.  **Result Variable:** We can avoid declaring a variable to store the result. The program can print `-1` or `1` and exit immediately upon finding the first difference. If the loop completes without finding any differences, it can then print `0`. This saves the 4 bytes that an `int result;` would require.\n\n**Final Memory Tally (m):**\nSumming the memory usage for the essential variables in the most memory-efficient implementation:\nm = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `c`) + (memory for `i`)\nm = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 1 byte\nm = 106 bytes\n\nThis is a significant improvement over the 206 bytes of the naive two-buffer approach and represents the minimal memory required for variables to solve the problem using standard C I/O.\n\n<<<106>>>"
