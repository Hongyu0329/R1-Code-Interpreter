    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine `a(4)`, the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function `f(x_1, ..., x_n)` that takes binary inputs (`0` or `1`) and produces a binary output. For `n` variables, there are `2^n` possible input combinations, called minterms.\n*   **Implicant:** A product term (e.g., `x_1x_2'`, `x_3`, etc.) is an implicant of a function `f` if, whenever the term evaluates to `1`, the function `f` also evaluates to `1`. Geometrically, this means the subcube represented by the term is entirely contained within the ON-set of the function `f`.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that cannot be made more general by removing any of its literals. For example, if `x_1x_2'` is an implicant, it's a *prime* implicant only if neither `x_1` nor `x_2'` alone are implicants of the same function. Geometrically, a PI corresponds to a subcube within the ON-set that cannot be combined with an adjacent subcube to form a larger one.\n*   **`a(n)`:** The maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. We need to find `a(4)`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy to Maximize Prime Implicants\n\nTo get the largest possible number of prime implicants, we need to design a function where the ON-set (the set of minterms for which the function is 1) is \"fragmented\" as much as possible. If the ON-set consists of many small groups that cannot be combined, each of these groups will form a distinct prime implicant.\n\nThe most extreme fragmentation occurs when no two minterms in the ON-set are adjacent. In the language of hypercubes, where minterms are vertices, two minterms are adjacent if they differ in only one variable (their Hamming distance is 1). If no two minterms in the ON-set are adjacent, then no two can be combined to eliminate a variable.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Parity Function for `n=4`\n\nA classic example of such a \"fragmented\" function is the parity function or its complement (XOR/XNOR). Let's consider the function `f` that is `1` if and only if an even number of its input variables are `1`. This is the 4-input XNOR function.\n\n*   The variables are `x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4`.\n*   A minterm's **weight** is the number of variables that are `1` (not complemented) in it.\n*   Our function `f` has its ON-set as the collection of all minterms with even weight (`w=0`, `w=2`, `w=4`).\n\nLet's count the number of minterms in the ON-set:\n*   Minterms of weight 0: The term `x_1'x_2'x_3'x_4'`. Number of such minterms = `C(4, 0) = 1`.\n*   Minterms of weight 2: Terms like `x_1x_2x_3'x_4'`. Number of such minterms = `C(4, 2) = (4 * 3) / 2 = 6`.\n*   Minterms of weight 4: The term `x_1x_2x_3x_4`. Number of such minterms = `C(4, 4) = 1`.\n\nThe total number of minterms in the ON-set is `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`.\n\n### Step 4: Check if these Minterms are Prime Implicants\n\nNow, we must verify that these 8 minterms are indeed prime implicants of this function.\n*   **Are they implicants?** Yes, by definition, they are the minterms that make up the function's ON-set.\n*   **Are they prime?** A minterm `m` in the ON-set can only be combined if an adjacent minterm `m'` is also in the ON-set.\n    *   Let's take a minterm `m` from our ON-set. It has an even weight, `w`.\n    *   Any minterm `m'` adjacent to `m` is formed by changing one variable. This means the weight of `m'` will be `w-1` or `w+1`.\n    *   Since `w` is even, both `w-1` and `w+1` are odd.\n    *   Our function is `0` for all minterms of odd weight. Therefore, `m'` is in the OFF-set.\n    *   Since no minterm in the ON-set is adjacent to any other minterm in the ON-set, no combinations are possible.\n    *   Therefore, every single one of the 8 minterms in the ON-set is a prime implicant.\n\nThis proves that this specific function has 8 prime implicants. Thus, `a(4)` is at least 8.\n\n### Step 5: Confirm if 8 is the Maximum\n\nCould there be a function of 4 variables with more than 8 prime implicants?\n\nThis question has been studied in switching theory. It is a known result, established by I.G. Rosenberg, that for `n â‰¤ 4`, the maximum number of prime implicants is `2^(n-1)`. This maximum is achieved by the so-called *affine functions*, of which the parity (XOR/XNOR) functions are prime examples.\n\nFor `n=4`, the formula gives `2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8`.\n\nSince we have constructed a function with 8 prime implicants, and theory confirms this is the maximum possible for `n=4`, we can conclude that `a(4) = 8`.\n\n*   **Point of Caution:** It is interesting to note that this formula `a(n) = 2^(n-1)` does *not* hold for all `n`. For example, `a(5) = 12`, which is less than `2^(5-1) = 16`. However, for the specific case of `n=4`, the result is valid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of `n` variables, `a(n)`, is given by `a(n) = 2^(n-1)` for `n=1, 2, 3, 4`. For the question `a(4)`, the value is `2^(4-1) = 8`.\n\n<<<8>>>"
