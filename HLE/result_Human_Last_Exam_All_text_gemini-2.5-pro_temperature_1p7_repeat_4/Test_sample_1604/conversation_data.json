    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Artist and the Subject:** The question asks for the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by the renowned British artist Elizabeth Thompson, more commonly known as Lady Butler (1846-1933). She was famous for her military scenes.\n\n2.  **List Major Battle Paintings by Lady Butler and their Historical Dates:** We need to compile a list of her significant paintings that depict specific battles or military events and identify the date of the event itself, not the date the painting was created.\n\n    *   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which occurred on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n    *   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, which occurred on **June 18, 1815**.\n    *   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted 1879): Depicts Assistant Surgeon William Brydon's arrival at Jalalabad, the sole European survivor of the retreat from Kabul in **January 1842**, during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n    *   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman, which took place on **November 5, 1854**, during the Crimean War.\n    *   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava on **October 25, 1854**.\n    *   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the famous defence which took place on **January 22-23, 1879**, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n    *   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1898): Depicts the charge of Lieutenant Robert Elwes at the Battle of Laing's Nek on **January 28, 1881**, during the First Boer War.\n    *   ***The Charge of the Gordon Highlanders at Dargai*** (painted 1898): Depicts an action during the Tirah Campaign on **October 20, 1897**.\n    *   ***The Charge of the 21st Lancers at Omdurman*** (c. 1898-1900): Depicts the cavalry charge at the Battle of Omdurman, which occurred on **September 2, 1898**, during the Mahdist War.\n    *   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted c. 1915): Depicts a scene from the Retreat from Mons, which occurred in **late August 1914**, during the opening stages of the First World War.\n\n3.  **Compare the Dates of the Historical Events:** Now we arrange the battles in chronological order to find the latest one.\n\n    *   Battle of Quatre Bras/Waterloo: **1815**\n    *   Retreat from Kabul: **1842**\n    *   Battle of Balaclava/Inkerman: **1854**\n    *   Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n    *   Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n    *   Charge at Dargai: **1897**\n    *   Battle of Omdurman: **1898**\n    *   Retreat from Mons: **1914**\n\n4.  **Identify the Latest Battle:** From the chronological list, the latest historical event depicted is the Retreat from Mons, which took place in 1914. This was a significant early battle of World War I.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Date of Painting vs. Date of Event:** It is crucial to distinguish between the year the artwork was painted and the year the historical event it portrays took place. The question specifically asks for the latest *historical* battle.\n*   **Comprehensiveness:** The analysis must consider a wide range of Lady Butler's work, including her later paintings from the early 20th century, not just her most famous Victorian-era pieces. Her works on the First World War are key to answering correctly.\n*   **Definition of \"Battle\":** The term is interpreted to include significant military actions and engagements, such as retreats, aftermaths, and specific charges within a larger conflict.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the historical dates of the events depicted in Lady Butler's paintings, the latest one is the Retreat from Mons (1914), a battle from the First World War.\n\n<<<The Retreat from Mons>>>"
