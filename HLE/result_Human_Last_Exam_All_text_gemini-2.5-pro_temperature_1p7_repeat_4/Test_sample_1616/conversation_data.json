    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\nTrisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel becomes short if it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of a word). This process typically occurs when suffixes are added to a base word.\n\nFor example:\n*   `sane` (long /eɪ/ vowel) -> `sanity` (short /æ/ vowel). The first syllable, `san-`, is the third from the end (`san-i-ty`).\n*   `divine` (long /aɪ/ vowel) -> `divinity` (short /ɪ/ vowel). The second syllable, `div-`, is the third from the end (`di-vin-i-ty`).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word against the definition of Trisyllabic Laxing.**\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   **Base word**: `south`\n    *   **Vowel comparison**: The vowel in `south` is /aʊ/, a diphthong derived from the Middle English long vowel /uː/. The vowel in `southern` is /ʌ/, which is a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis**: Vowel shortening has occurred. However, `southern` is a two-syllable word (`south-ern`). This is an example of vowel shortening, but it is not *trisyllabic* laxing, as the word doesn't have three syllables. So, while it shows a related process, it's not the specific one in question.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   **Base word**: `derive`\n    *   **Vowel comparison**: The vowel in the stressed syllable of `derive` is /aɪ/, a long vowel (diphthong). In `derivative`, the corresponding vowel is /ɪ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis**: The word `derivative` has four syllables (`de-riv-a-tive`). The stressed syllable `-riv-` is the antepenultimate (third from the end). The long vowel has become short. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   **Base word**: `serene`\n    *   **Vowel comparison**: The vowel in `serene` is /iː/, a long vowel. In `serenity`, the corresponding vowel is /ɛ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis**: The word `serenity` has four syllables (`se-ren-i-ty`). The stressed syllable `-ren-` is the antepenultimate. The long vowel has become short. This is another classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   **Base word**: `please`\n    *   **Vowel comparison**: The vowel in `please` is /iː/, a long vowel. The vowel in `pleasant` is /ɛ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis**: Vowel shortening has occurred. However, `pleasant` is a two-syllable word (`pleas-ant`). Like `southern`, this is an example of vowel shortening (specifically before a consonant cluster), but not *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   **Related word**: `grateful` (from the Latin root `gratus`, meaning \"pleasing, thankful\").\n    *   **Vowel comparison**: The vowel sound in the root can be seen in `grateful` as the long vowel /eɪ/. In `gratitude`, the corresponding vowel is /æ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis**: The word `gratitude` has three syllables (`grat-i-tude`). The stressed syllable `grat-` is the antepenultimate. The long vowel sound of the root has become short. This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   **Etymology**: The word `shadow` comes from the Old English `sceadu`. The related word `shade` comes from Old English `scead`.\n    *   **Vowel comparison**: The vowel in `shadow`, /æ/, has always been short throughout its history. It was never a long vowel that was subsequently shortened. While it is related to `shade`, which has a long vowel /eɪ/, `shadow` is not derived from `shade` in a way that would trigger laxing. They are two separate developments from a common ancestor.\n    *   **Analysis**: Since the vowel in `shadow` was never long to begin with, it cannot have undergone laxing (which is a shortening process). Furthermore, the word only has two syllables. Therefore, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude by identifying the correct word.**\n\n*   `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` have all clearly undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` have undergone vowel shortening, but not the *trisyllabic* variety because they are disyllabic.\n*   `shadow` has not undergone any such vowel shortening process at all because its vowel was historically short. It also isn't trisyllabic.\n\nThe question asks which word has **not** undergone the process. `shadow` is the strongest choice because it hasn't experienced this type of shortening at all, whereas `southern` and `pleasant` have, even if not under the specific \"trisyllabic\" condition.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
