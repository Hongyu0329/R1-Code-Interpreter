    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from the 1972 movie *Solaris*, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The character is defined by a particular feeling: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This is a very specific emotional and nostalgic statement.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and their Motivations**\nLet's consider each character provided in the answer choices in the context of the film's themes of memory, humanity, and alienation.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins and ends with him on Earth, near a dacha surrounded by nature. He is deeply connected to Earth and his past. While he certainly misses Earth, the specific sentiment of being *ashamed* of this feeling is a key differentiator. His main emotional turmoil is centered around his deceased wife, Hari, and his guilt over her death.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"visitor\" or \"guest,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his dead wife, created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. She has no authentic memories of Earth herself; her knowledge and feelings are borrowed from Kris. Therefore, she could not genuinely miss something she never experienced.\n*   **C. Snaut:** One of the scientists who has been on the space station for a long time. He is weary, cynical, and philosophical. He often acts as a guide for Kris, explaining the strange phenomena and reflecting on the human condition. Having been away from Earth for so long, a profound sense of homesickness combined with a feeling of failure or inadequacy as a \"conqueror of space\" would fit his character. He represents the psychological exhaustion of humanity's cosmic ambitions.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist on the station. He is portrayed as cold, detached, and rigorously scientific. He views the \"visitors\" as mere objects of study and is contemptuous of human emotions, which he sees as a weakness getting in the way of science. It would be highly uncharacteristic for Sartorius to admit to such a sentimental feeling, let alone feel shame over it.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A friend of Kris's and a fellow scientist. Kris finds a video testament from Gibarian after discovering he has committed suicide. In the video, Gibarian is in despair and warns Kris, but his message is one of immediate horror and confusion about the nature of the \"visitors,\" not nostalgic shame.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Dialogue**\nThe crucial part is recalling or identifying the exact scene and line of dialogue. There is a specific conversation in the film where this sentiment is expressed.\n\n*   In a conversation with Kris Kelvin, Dr. Snaut reflects on their purpose in space. He confesses his intense homesickness.\n*   The key line of dialogue, spoken by Snaut, is: \"Isn't it shameful for a space explorer to be homesick? For a cosmonaut to miss the sound of rustling leaves?\"\n*   This quote directly links the character of Snaut to both the feeling of shame (\"shameful\") and the specific memory of \"the sound of rustling leaves.\"\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the character analysis and the specific dialogue from the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. He feels that as a scientist and explorer, he should be focused on the new frontier of space, but instead, he is overwhelmed by a simple, human longing for Earth, which he feels is a shameful weakness.\n\n<<<C>>>"
