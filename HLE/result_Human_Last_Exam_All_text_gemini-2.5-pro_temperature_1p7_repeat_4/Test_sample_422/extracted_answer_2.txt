1. **Circularity or Infinite Regress of Justification:** The JTB model requires a justification for a belief. Under the constraint that all epistemic states are either 'Knowledge' or 'Belief', the justification itself must be one of these. If the justification is a mere 'Belief', it is too weak to ground knowledge. If it must be 'Knowledge', the definition becomes circular (knowledge requires knowledge) or leads to an infinite regress.
2. **The Inability to Account for Justified Falsehood:** The framework requires any state that is not 'Knowledge' to be 'Belief'. This collapses the important category of a "justified false belief" into the same category as an "unjustified belief". As a result, the model cannot distinguish between a rational, evidence-based error and a pure guess or delusion, which undermines the entire purpose of the "Justification" condition.
