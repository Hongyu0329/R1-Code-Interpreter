    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, a list of careful points, and the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks us to identify two problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, given two specific constraints:\n1.  **JTB Definition:** Knowledge is a belief that is simultaneously Justified, True, and a Belief.\n2.  **Constraint 1:** The only two available epistemic states for an individual regarding a proposition are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This creates a strict dichotomy: if a mental state concerning a proposition is not Knowledge, it must be Belief.\n3.  **Constraint 2:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are scenarios where a person has a justified true belief that is not knowledge due to luck, so we need to find different kinds of issues.\n\nLet's analyze the implications of these constraints on the JTB model.\n\n**Problem 1: The Status of Justification (Leading to a Regress or Circularity)**\n\n1.  The JTB model states that for a belief in a proposition (P) to be knowledge, it must be justified.\n2.  This justification must come from somewhere, typically from another belief or set of beliefs (let's call the justifying belief Q).\n3.  We must now ask: what is the epistemic status of our belief in Q? According to the constraint, the state must be either Knowledge or Belief.\n4.  **Option A: The justification (Q) is a Belief.** If the reason for our belief in P is just another Belief, then our foundation is weak. This justifying belief (Q) could be false, or itself unjustified. It seems inadequate for Q to serve as the justification that elevates P to the status of Knowledge. A house built on a foundation of sand is not secure.\n5.  **Option B: The justification (Q) must be Knowledge.** This seems more secure, but it creates a circularity or an infinite regress. If to *know* P we must first *know* Q, then the definition of knowledge relies on pre-existing knowledge. To know Q, we would in turn need a justification, R, that we also know. This leads to an infinite chain (P requires knowing Q, which requires knowing R, which requires knowing S...), making it impossible to know anything.\n6.  Therefore, the strict dichotomy of Knowledge/Belief forces the JTB model into a dilemma regarding justification: it's either too weak to warrant the status of knowledge (if it's a belief) or it presupposes knowledge, making the definition circular or regressive.\n\n**Problem 2: The Elimination of Justified False Belief**\n\n1.  A key function of the \"Justification\" condition in epistemology is to differentiate rational beliefs from irrational ones, independent of whether they are true. It is perfectly possible to hold a highly justified belief that turns out to be false. For example, for centuries, the belief that the sun revolved around the Earth was well-justified based on the available evidence.\n2.  According to the JTB definition, this justified but false belief is **not** Knowledge, because it fails the \"Truth\" condition.\n3.  According to our constraint, if this state is not Knowledge, it must be categorized simply as \"Belief.\"\n4.  This creates a serious problem: the single category of \"Belief\" now lumps together epistemically distinct states. The scientist's well-reasoned, evidence-based (but false) theory is placed in the exact same category as an unsupported guess, a random hunch, or a delusion.\n5.  The model loses its ability to account for rational error. The binary system of Knowledge/Belief erases the crucial concept of a **justified false belief**. This undermines the significance of the \"J\" condition, as it can no longer be used to identify rational beliefs unless they also happen to be true.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   The core of both problems is the artificial but mandatory constraint that the only two epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". Standard epistemological analysis does not have this limitation and can freely discuss concepts like \"justified false belief\" without classifying it as a final state.\n*   Problem 1 is a classic epistemological issue (the Agrippan trilemma), but the two-state constraint makes it particularly stark and seemingly unsolvable within the provided framework.\n*   Problem 2 demonstrates that the two-state constraint cripples the JTB model's ability to perform one of its most important functions: evaluating the rationality of beliefs that are not knowledge.\n*   These problems are distinct from Gettier problems, as they concern the internal coherence and explanatory power of the JTB framework under the given constraints, rather than external counterexamples where all JTB conditions are met.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the two problems that the JTB definition runs into under these constraints are the problem of justification's own status and the inability to distinguish rational errors from irrational beliefs.\n\n<<<1. **Circularity or Infinite Regress of Justification:** The JTB model requires a justification for a belief. Under the constraint that all epistemic states are either 'Knowledge' or 'Belief', the justification itself must be one of these. If the justification is a mere 'Belief', it is too weak to ground knowledge. If it must be 'Knowledge', the definition becomes circular (knowledge requires knowledge) or leads to an infinite regress.\n2. **The Inability to Account for Justified Falsehood:** The framework requires any state that is not 'Knowledge' to be 'Belief'. This collapses the important category of a \"justified false belief\" into the same category as an \"unjustified belief\". As a result, the model cannot distinguish between a rational, evidence-based error and a pure guess or delusion, which undermines the entire purpose of the \"Justification\" condition.>>>"
