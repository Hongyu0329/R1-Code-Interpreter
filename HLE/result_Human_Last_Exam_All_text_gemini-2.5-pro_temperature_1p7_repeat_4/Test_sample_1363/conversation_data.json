    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks to identify the specific ballroom dance from the given options in which \"overturning\" a \"reverse turn\" is considered technically impossible if one adheres strictly to the dance's established technique.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing where the couple rotates to the left while progressing down the line of dance.\n    *   **Overturning:** The act of rotating more than the technically prescribed amount for a specific figure. This is often used as a floorcraft tool, especially for navigating corners on the dance floor.\n    *   **Without Disregarding the Technique:** This is the crucial constraint. It means we must consider the fundamental principles, footwork, timing, and character of each dance. If overturning the figure requires breaking these fundamental rules, then it's considered \"impossible\" within the context of the question.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Dance Option:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The Viennese Waltz is characterized by continuous rotation. While there is a standard amount of turn for the Reverse Turn, dancers can and do slightly adjust the rotation to navigate the floor. Overturning is possible and sometimes necessary.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** The Waltz is a swing dance with significant rise and fall. The Reverse Turn is a cornerstone figure. Dancers frequently overturn or underturn the figure, particularly at corners, by using the momentum of the swing. This is a key aspect of floorcraft and is not considered a violation of the dance's fundamental technique.\n\n    *   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, the Slow Foxtrot is a smooth, flowing swing dance. Figures like the Reverse Turn and Reverse Wave are designed to flow one into another. Adjusting the amount of turn is a standard part of navigating the floor and is technically permissible.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** This is another dynamic swing dance. Its speed and energy require a high degree of floorcraft. Overturning or underturning figures, including reverse movements, is essential for navigating a crowded floor at high speed and is technically acceptable.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the other four dances (which are all \"swing\" dances). Key characteristics of Tango technique include:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The movement is kept level.\n        *   **No Swing:** There is no pendulum-like swing of the body. Movement is staccato, sharp, and clipped.\n        *   **Action of Closing Feet:** In many Tango figures, including the end of a basic Reverse Turn, the moving foot is brought decisively to close against the standing foot, often without weight change initially (a \"Close\").\n        *   **Specific Footwork:** The Reverse Turn in Tango has a very precise sequence. For example, in an Open Reverse Turn, the man might step forward LF, then side RF, then close LF to RF. The turn is executed over the first two steps. The third step is a close which arrests the rotation. Attempting to turn further on the third step would violate the \"Close\" action and the staccato character of the dance. It would introduce a pivot or a twist that is not part of the standard figure's technique. The abrupt halt of rotation is a defining feature.\n\n4.  **Conclusion from the Analysis:**\n    In the four swing dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), the continuous, flowing momentum allows for adjustments in rotation (overturning) as part of good floorcraft. The technique supports this flexibility. In Tango, the lack of swing and the sharp, staccato action, culminating in a \"Close\" that ends the rotation, makes overturning the Reverse Turn technically impossible without fundamentally violating the character and technique of the dance. To overturn it, one would have to disregard the prescribed action.\n\nTherefore, the European Tango is the dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
