    "This is a classic question in the field of point-set topology, specifically in continuum theory. To answer it, we need to carefully define the terms and then apply a major classification theorem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terms\n\n1.  **Continuum:** A continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space.\n2.  **Planar:** A space is planar if it is homeomorphic to a subset of the Euclidean plane, ℝ².\n3.  **Homogeneous:** A topological space `X` is homogeneous if for any two points `x` and `y` in `X`, there exists a homeomorphism `h: X → X` such that `h(x) = y`. In simple terms, the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n4.  **Homeomorphism Class:** This is a collection of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to each other. The question asks for the number of these distinct classes that satisfy the given properties (planar, homogeneous, continuum).\n\nSo, the question is: How many topologically distinct types of non-empty, compact, connected, homogeneous subsets of the plane are there?\n\n### Step 2: The Trivial Case (Degenerate Continuum)\n\nThe simplest possible continuum is a **single point**.\n*   It is a subset of the plane ℝ².\n*   It is compact, connected, and non-empty, so it's a planar continuum.\n*   It is trivially homogeneous: for any two points `x` and `y` in the space, it must be that `x = y`, and the identity map sends `x` to `y`.\nAll single-point spaces are homeomorphic to each other. Therefore, the single point constitutes **one** homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 3: The Non-Trivial Case (Non-Degenerate Continua)\n\nFor continua that are not single points, we rely on a deep result in topology known as the **Bing-Jones Classification Theorem**. This theorem classifies all non-degenerate (not a single point) homogeneous planar continua.\n\nThe theorem states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of three types of spaces:\n\n1.  **The Circle (S¹)**\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc**\n3.  **A Circle of Pseudo-arcs**\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Homeomorphism Classes for Each Type\n\nNow we must determine how many distinct homeomorphism classes each of these three types contains.\n\n1.  **The Circle (S¹):**\n    *   The circle is the canonical example of a homogeneous planar continuum.\n    *   Any space homeomorphic to a circle is, by definition, in the same class.\n    *   This type contributes exactly **one** homeomorphism class.\n\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc:**\n    *   The pseudo-arc is a fascinating and complex space. It is snake-like, indecomposable (cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua), and chainable.\n    *   It was a major result by R. H. Bing in 1951 to show that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous.\n    *   It is also a known theorem that any two pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other.\n    *   Therefore, the pseudo-arc contributes exactly **one** homeomorphism class.\n\n3.  **A Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    *   This is a type of space constructed by arranging pseudo-arcs in a circular fashion. More formally, it is a continuum which can be continuously decomposed into a collection of pseudo-arcs, where the space of these pseudo-arcs (the quotient space) is a circle.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** Unlike the circle and the pseudo-arc, \"a circle of pseudo-arcs\" is **not** a single homeomorphism class.\n    *   It was proven by James T. Rogers, Jr. (1979) that there are **uncountably many** mutually non-homeomorphic continua of this type. The cardinality of this set of classes is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum ( `2^{\\aleph_0}` ).\n\n### Step 5: Final Tally\n\nTo find the total number of homeomorphism classes, we sum the counts from each case:\n\n*   Degenerate case (the point): **1** class\n*   Non-degenerate case (from Bing-Jones Theorem):\n    *   The Circle: **1** class\n    *   The Pseudo-arc: **1** class\n    *   Circles of Pseudo-arcs: **Uncountably many** classes (`c`)\n\nTotal number of classes = 1 + 1 + 1 + (uncountably many) = uncountably many.\n\nThe total number of homeomorphism classes is uncountably infinite.\n\n<<<Uncountably infinite>>>"
