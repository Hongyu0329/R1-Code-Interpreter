    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the possible degrees of the normal field extensions.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet the given polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can try to find a common factor among groups of terms.\nNotice that we can group the terms as follows:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nFactoring out the common term $(x^2 - 2)$, we get:\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their Galois groups**\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$**:\n    *   This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (e.g., by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$).\n    *   Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   The splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} = C_2$.\n\n*   **For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**:\n    *   This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3, all other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3) are divisible by 3, and the constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n    *   To determine its Galois group, we analyze its roots. $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x^4 = 9/5$, which gives two real roots $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    *   $h(x)$ has local maxima and minima at these two real points. Since $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} h(x) = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} h(x) = -\\infty$, the signs of the local extrema determine the number of real roots.\n        *   At the local maximum, the value is positive.\n        *   At the local minimum, the value is negative.\n    *   This profile implies that $h(x)$ has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots.\n    *   A standard theorem in Galois theory states that the Galois group of an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ which has exactly two non-real roots is the symmetric group $S_p$.\n    *   Here, $p=5$, so the Galois group of $h(x)$ is $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, where $K_h$ is the splitting field of $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its irreducible factors, so $K = K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) K_h$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $G_g \\times G_h \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The group $G$ is isomorphic to the direct product if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   The field $K_h$ has Galois group $S_5$. The subgroups of index 2 in $S_5$ correspond to quadratic subextensions. There is only one such subgroup, the alternating group $A_5$.\n*   The quadratic subfield corresponding to $A_5$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\n*   The discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$.\n*   For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n*   $D = (-1)^{10} (5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049 = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\n*   The unique quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This is not equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Therefore, the intersection of the fields is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   This means the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n    $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\n*   The order of the Galois group is $|G| = |S_5| \\cdot |C_2| = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal extensions**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, a subextension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if its corresponding subgroup, $\\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is equal to the index of the subgroup $[G : \\text{Gal}(K/L)]$.\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ and calculate their indices.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not always of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\vartriangleleft G_1, N_2 \\vartriangleleft G_2$. This only holds if $G_1$ and $G_2$ have no common factor groups. Here, $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$ and $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$, so there is a common factor group, which gives rise to an additional \"diagonal\" normal subgroup.\n\nThe proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ are:\n1.  $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: The index is $|G|/|S_5 \\times \\{e\\}| = 240/120 = 2$.\n2.  $A_5 \\times C_2$: The index is $|G|/|A_5 \\times C_2| = 240/(60 \\cdot 2) = 240/120 = 2$.\n3.  The \"diagonal\" subgroup $H = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g) = c \\}$. (Where we identify $C_2$ with $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ and $\\text{sgn}(g)$ is the sign map). This subgroup has size $120$ and is normal of index 2.\n4.  $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: This subgroup is the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ and is also the intersection of the three index-2 subgroups listed above. Its index is $|G|/|A_5 \\times \\{e\\}| = 240/60 = 4$.\n5.  $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$: This is the center $Z(G)$ of the group. Its index is $|G|/|\\{e\\} \\times C_2| = 240/2 = 120$.\n\nThese are all the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$. The corresponding extensions $L$ satisfy $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n\n**Step 5: List the degrees**\n\nThe possible degrees for such normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of these normal subgroups.\nThe set of possible indices is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Degree 2: Corresponds to three distinct quadratic extensions. Example: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Degree 4: Corresponds to the biquadratic extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-14863419})$.\n*   Degree 120: Corresponds to the splitting field $K_h$ of $x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\nAll these degrees correspond to fields that are proper subfields of $K$ (since the degrees are less than 240) and proper extensions of $\\mathbb{Q}$ (since the degrees are greater than 1).\n\nThus, the possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
