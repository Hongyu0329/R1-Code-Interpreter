    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object**\nLet $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means $X$ is the zero locus of a generic homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in 4 variables.\n*   The ambient space is $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, complex dimension 3.\n*   $X$ is a hypersurface, so its complex dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X = 3-1 = 2$.\n*   As a real manifold, its dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} X = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   All smooth quintic hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ are diffeomorphic. We can therefore analyze a specific one, like the Fermat quintic defined by $Z_0^5 + Z_1^5 + Z_2^5 + Z_3^5 = 0$, without loss of generality.\n\n**Step 2: Relate $\\pi_3(X)$ to the homotopy of a different space**\nThe hypersurface $X$ is defined by a homogeneous polynomial $F(Z_0, Z_1, Z_2, Z_3) = 0$. The affine cone over $X$ is the variety $V = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^4 | F(z) = 0\\}$. Since $X$ is smooth, the only singular point of $V$ is the origin $0 \\in \\mathbb{C}^4$.\nThe link of this isolated singularity is the intersection of $V$ with a small sphere centered at the origin, $K = V \\cap S^7$, where $S^7$ is the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{C}^4$.\n\nThe space $K$ is related to $X$ via an $S^1$-bundle fibration (coming from the Hopf fibration $S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ restricted to $X$):\n$S^1 \\to K \\to X$.\n\nThe long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this fibration is:\n$\\cdots \\to \\pi_k(S^1) \\to \\pi_k(K) \\to \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_{k-1}(S^1) \\to \\cdots$\n\nFor $k=3$, this gives:\n$\\cdots \\to \\pi_3(S^1) \\to \\pi_3(K) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_2(S^1) \\to \\cdots$\nSince $\\pi_k(S^1)=0$ for $k \\ge 2$, we have $\\pi_3(S^1)=0$ and $\\pi_2(S^1)=0$.\nThe sequence becomes $0 \\to \\pi_3(K) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0$, which implies that $\\pi_3(K) \\cong \\pi_3(X)$.\nThus, the problem is reduced to finding the rank of $\\pi_3(K)$.\n\n**Step 3: Use known results about the homotopy of links of singularities**\nFor a link $K$ of an isolated hypersurface singularity in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with $n \\ge 4$, a result by Avakjanc provides the structure of the third homotopy group:\n$\\pi_3(K) \\cong H_3(K; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\Lambda^2(H_2(K; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\nHere, $\\Lambda^2(G)$ denotes the exterior square of an abelian group $G$. The rank of this group is given by:\n$\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(K)) = \\text{rank}(H_3(K)) + \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^2(H_2(K))) = b_3(K) + \\binom{b_2(K)}{2}$.\nSo we need to compute the Betti numbers $b_2(K)$ and $b_3(K)$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Betti numbers of the link $K$**\nThe homology of the link $K$ is related to the homology of the original projective hypersurface $X$.\nA known result states that for a smooth hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ and the associated link $K$, the second Betti number is given by:\n$b_2(K) = b_2^{\\text{prim}}(X) = b_2(X) - 1$.\nThe Betti number $b_2(X)$ can be found using the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. For a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the Euler characteristic is given by the formula:\n$\\chi(X) = \\frac{1}{d}[(1-d)^{n+1}-1] + (n+1)$.\nFor our case, $d=5$ and $n=3$:\n$\\chi(X) = \\frac{1}{5}[(1-5)^4 - 1] + (3+1) = \\frac{1}{5}[(-4)^4 - 1] + 4 = \\frac{1}{5}[256 - 1] + 4 = \\frac{255}{5} + 4 = 51+4 = 55$.\nThe Betti numbers of $X$ are related by $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\nBy the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, $b_1(X) = b_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\nBy PoincarÃ© Duality, $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\nAlso, $b_0(X)=1$ as $X$ is connected, and $b_4(X)=1$ as it's a closed oriented 4-manifold.\nSo, $\\chi(X) = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = b_2 + 2$.\n$55 = b_2 + 2 \\implies b_2(X) = 53$.\nTherefore, $b_2(K) = b_2(X) - 1 = 53 - 1 = 52$.\n\nNow we compute $b_3(K)$. For the link of an isolated singularity in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ ($n \\ge 3$), it is known that $b_k(K) = b_{2n-2-k}(K)$ (it's a $(2n-2)$-manifold). Moreover, a more specific result shows that $b_3(K) = b_2(K)$ for links of smooth projective hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This follows from Alexander duality and the Wang sequence of the Milnor fibration associated with the singularity.\nSo, $b_3(K) = b_2(K) = 52$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final rank**\nNow we plug the Betti numbers into the formula for the rank of $\\pi_3(K)$:\n$\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(K)) = b_3(K) + \\binom{b_2(K)}{2}$\n$\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 52 + \\binom{52}{2}$\n$\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 26 \\times 51 = 1326$.\n$\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 52 + 1326 = 1378$.\n\n>>> 1378"
