    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the phonological and morphological changes from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form to its reflexes in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form\n\n*   **PIE Form:** *seh₂gieti*\n*   **Root:** *seh₂g-* (meaning 'to track, seek out, perceive'). The cognates Hittite *sākizzi* ('gives a sign, omen') and Latin *sāgīre* ('to perceive keenly') support this reconstruction.\n*   **Suffix:** *-ie-*, forming a present tense stem.\n*   **Ending:** *-ti*, the 3rd person singular present active indicative ending.\n\n### Step 2: Trace from PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc.)\n\n1.  **Laryngeal Effect:** The laryngeal *h₂* colors the preceding *e* to *a* and is then lost.\n    *   *seh₂g-* → *sāg-*\n2.  **Vowel Shift:** PIE long *ā* regularly becomes Proto-Germanic long *ō*.\n    *   *sāg-* → *sōg-*\n3.  **Grimm's Law:** This major sound shift affects consonants. The relevant rule here is that PIE voiced stops become PGmc. voiceless stops. Thus, PIE *g* becomes PGmc. *k*.\n    *   *sōg-* → *sōk-*\n4.  **Verbal Morphology:** The PIE *-ie/yo-* present becomes a weak verb in Germanic. Because the root *sōk-* is \"heavy\" (contains a long vowel), it becomes a Class I weak verb with the infinitive suffix *-janą*. The infinitive is reconstructed as **\\*sōkijaną**.\n5.  **3rd Person Singular Ending:** The PIE ending *-ti* becomes PGmc. *-þi*.\n    *   *-ti* → *-þi*\n6.  **Final PGmc. Form:** Combining the stem *sōki-* with the ending *-þi* gives the 3rd person singular form. The final short *-i* of the ending is often lost, leading to the common reconstruction of **\\*sōkiþ**.\n\n**Proto-Germanic result: \\*sōkiþ**\n\n### Step 3: Trace from Proto-Germanic to the Daughter Languages\n\n#### Old Norse (ON)\n\n1.  **Base Form:** PGmc. *\\*sōkiþ*\n2.  **I-Umlaut:** The *i* in the stem (*sōki-*) causes the mutation of the back vowel *ō* to the front vowel *œ*.\n    *   *ō* → *œ*\n3.  **Ending:** The 3rd person singular present indicative ending *-iþ* becomes *-ir* in Old Norse.\n4.  **Final Old Norse Form:** The stem becomes *sœk-* and the ending is *-ir*.\n\n**Old Norse result: sœkir** ('he/she seeks')\n\n#### Old English (OE)\n\n1.  **Base Form:** PGmc. *\\*sōkiþ*\n2.  **I-Umlaut:** The *i* in the stem causes i-umlaut. In Old English, PGmc. *ō* becomes *ē*.\n    *   *ō* → *ē*\n3.  **Palatalization:** The velar consonant *k* is palatalized to *ċ* (pronounced /tʃ/) because it is followed by the front vowel sound originally represented by *i/j*.\n    *   *k* → *ċ* /tʃ/\n4.  **Ending:** The 3rd person singular ending *-iþ* becomes *-eþ* or is syncopated to *-þ*.\n5.  **Final Old English Form:** The stem is *sēċ-*. With the ending, the form is *sēceþ*.\n\n**Old English result: sēceþ** (also written *sēcþ*)\n\n#### Old High German (OHG)\n\n1.  **Base Form:** PGmc. *\\*sōkiþ*\n2.  **Vowel Shift:** PGmc. *ō* diphthongizes to *uo* in Old High German.\n    *   *ō* → *uo*\n3.  **High German Consonant Shift:** PGmc. *k* shifts to the long voiceless fricative *hh* (pronounced /xx/) when it occurs after a vowel.\n    *   *k* → *hh* (often spelled *ch*)\n4.  **Lack of I-Umlaut:** A key feature of OHG is that for heavy-stem Class I weak verbs, the *-i-* of the stem was lost before it caused umlaut on back vowels. Therefore, the *uo* does not mutate to *üe* in this verb's standard conjugation. This is a point of contrast with Old English and Old Norse, a phenomenon sometimes known as *Rückumlaut* (reverse umlaut).\n5.  **Ending:** The 3rd person singular ending *-iþ* becomes *-it* in Old High German.\n6.  **Final Old High German Form:** The stem is *suohh-*. With the ending *-it*, the result is *suohhit*.\n\n**Old High German result: suohhit**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *\\*sōkiþ*\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkir*\n*   **Old English:** *sēceþ*\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhit*\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ*, Old Norse: *sœkir*, Old English: *sēceþ*, Old High German: *suohhit*>>>"
