    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ above the prime $p=2$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the curve and its genus.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is 5. The genus of the curve is given by the formula $g = \\lfloor(\\deg(f)-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n$g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor 4/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\nSo, we are dealing with a curve of genus 2. The stable reduction of this curve must be a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2. A stable curve is a connected, reduced curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the stable reduction at p=2.**\nThe structure of the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve over a local field (like the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$) is determined by the clustering of its branch points with respect to the p-adic valuation (here, the 2-adic valuation, denoted $\\nu_2$).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the branch points.**\nThe branch points of the hyperelliptic curve are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the point at infinity (since the degree of $f(x)$ is odd, infinity is a branch point).\n$f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\nOne branch point is $x_1 = 0$.\nThe other four branch points are the roots of the polynomial $h(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nThe sixth branch point is $x_6 = \\infty$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the 2-adic valuations of the branch points.**\nWe need to find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $h(x)$. We use the Newton polygon method for the polynomial $h(x)$ with respect to the prime $p=2$.\nThe coefficients of $h(x)$ are $c_4=8, c_3=4, c_2=4, c_1=1, c_0=8$.\nTheir 2-adic valuations are:\n$\\nu_2(c_4) = \\nu_2(8) = 3$\n$\\nu_2(c_3) = \\nu_2(4) = 2$\n$\\nu_2(c_2) = \\nu_2(4) = 2$\n$\\nu_2(c_1) = \\nu_2(1) = 0$\n$\\nu_2(c_0) = \\nu_2(8) = 3$\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, \\nu_2(c_i))$: $(4,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,0), (0,3)$.\nTo find the lower convex hull, we plot these points and find the chain of segments with increasing slopes from right to left.\n-   The segment connecting $(4,3)$ and $(1,0)$ has a slope of $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. The points $(3,2)$ and $(2,2)$ lie on or above the line connecting these two points. So this is a valid segment of the polygon. Its horizontal length is $4-1=3$.\n-   The segment connecting $(1,0)$ and $(0,3)$ has a slope of $(0-3)/(1-0) = -3$. Its horizontal length is $1-0=1$.\nThe Newton polygon has two segments. The slopes determine the valuations of the roots: $\\nu_2(\\text{root}) = -(\\text{slope})$.\n-   The slope of 1 (length 3) implies there are three roots, let's call them $x_2, x_3, x_4$, with $\\nu_2(x_i) = -1$.\n-   The slope of -3 (length 1) implies there is one root, $x_5$, with $\\nu_2(x_5) = -(-3) = 3$.\nSo, the valuations of the six branch points $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_6\\}$ are:\n$\\nu_2(x_1) = \\nu_2(0) = \\infty$\n$\\nu_2(x_{2,3,4}) = -1$\n$\\nu_2(x_5) = 3$\n$\\nu_2(x_6=\\infty)$ is taken care of by the framework.\n\n**Step 5: Partition the branch points.**\nWe partition the branch points based on their 2-adic absolute value, $|x|_2 = 2^{-\\nu_2(x)}$.\n-   Cluster $S_1$ contains points in the disk $|x|_2 < 1$ (i.e., $\\nu_2(x) > 0$). These are $x_1=0$ and $x_5$ (since $\\nu_2(x_5)=3>0$). So, $|S_1| = 2$.\n-   Cluster $S_2$ contains points on the annulus $|x|_2 = 1$ (i.e., $\\nu_2(x) = 0$). There are no such branch points. So, $|S_2| = 0$.\n-   Cluster $S_3$ contains points in the outer disk $|x|_2 > 1$ (i.e., $\\nu_2(x) < 0$ or $x=\\infty$). These are $x_2, x_3, x_4$ (since $\\nu_2(x_i)=-1<0$) and $x_6=\\infty$. So, $|S_3| = 4$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the structure of the stable reduction.**\nSince the middle cluster $S_2$ is empty, the stable reduction consists of two irreducible components, $C_1$ and $C_3$, corresponding to the clusters $S_1$ and $S_3$.\nThe genus $g_i$ of each component $C_i$ is given by $g_i = \\lfloor(|S_i|-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n-   For component $C_1$: $|S_1|=2 \\implies g_1 = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$. So $C_1$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n-   For component $C_3$: $|S_3|=4 \\implies g_3 = \\lfloor(4-1)/2\\rfloor = 1$. So $C_3$ is an elliptic curve.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the number of double points.**\nThe arithmetic genus of the stable fiber must be equal to the genus of the original curve, which is 2. The arithmetic genus of a curve composed of two components $C_1, C_3$ intersecting at $\\delta$ points (which are the double points) is given by the formula:\n$p_a = g_1 + g_3 + \\delta - 1$\nWe know $p_a = 2$, $g_1=0$, and $g_3=1$.\n$2 = 0 + 1 + \\delta - 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\nThus, the number of intersection points is 2. These are the ordinary double points of the stable reduction.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\n<<<2>>>"
