    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify a classical ballet step from the given options where the final leg position is identical to the initial leg position. This means that if the step starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, it must also end in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n**Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option:**\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** This is a step of batterie (beaten step). The dancer jumps vertically from fifth position. The name \"six\" refers to six movements (crossings or changes) of the legs in the air. For an even-numbered entrechat like `quatre`, `six`, or `huit`, the dancer lands on two feet. A key characteristic of an even-numbered entrechat is that it finishes in the same position from which it started. The complex series of beats is designed to bring the legs back to their original alignment.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in fifth position with the same foot in front (in our example, the right foot).\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to distinguish between even-numbered entrechats (like `six`), which do not change, and odd-numbered entrechats (like `trois` or `cinq`), which land on one foot with the other in a position like `cou-de-pied`, and are considered changed.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   `Échappé`: To escape. A jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second).\n    *   `Battu`: Beaten. As the legs return from second position to fifth, they beat together.\n    *   `Changé`: Changed. This explicitly indicates that the feet will switch their front/back relationship.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (in our example, the left foot would now be in front).\n*   **Careful Point:** The word `changé` in the name is the definitive clue that the position changes.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** `Assemblé` means \"to assemble.\" The working leg brushes out to the side, front, or back. The dancer then jumps from the supporting leg, bringing both legs together (\"assembling\" them) in the air before landing. Most standard `assemblés` (like `assemblé dessus` or `dessous`) involve a change of feet. For example, in an `assemblé dessus`, the working leg travels over and lands in front of the supporting leg, changing the position.\n*   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but typically with the feet changed.\n*   **Careful Point:** While there are non-changing (`sans changer`) versions, a simple \"assemblé\" in most contexts implies a change. Compared to Entrechat six, which is defined as not changing, this is not the best answer.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** `Glissade` means \"to glide,\" and `derrière` means \"behind.\" This step is initiated by the back foot (the left foot in our example). The back foot glides out to the side, the dancer transfers weight onto it, and the front foot (the right foot) glides to close in fifth position *behind* the other foot.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer finishes in fifth position with the feet switched (the left foot is now in front).\n*   **Careful Point:** The direction `derrière` (or `devant`) in a standard glissade dictates which foot initiates the movement and results in a change of feet upon closing.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step. It is essentially a `pas de chat` where both legs perform a `rond de jambe en l'air` (a circular movement) during the jump. The typical execution involves landing on one foot first and then closing the other, which results in a change of feet.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the foot that started in the back now in the front.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is an advanced step, but its standard execution results in a change of feet, similar to a `pas de chat`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter analyzing all the options, **Entrechat six** is the only step that, by its standard definition, starts and ends in the exact same leg position. The other four steps (`Échappé battu changé`, `Assemblé`, `Glissade derrière`, and `Gargouillade`) all involve a change of which foot is in front from the start to the finish.\n\n<<<A>>>"
