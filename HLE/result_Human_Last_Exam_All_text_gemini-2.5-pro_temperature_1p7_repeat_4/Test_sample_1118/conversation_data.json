    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after Querner had escaped from the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA, an early Nazi paramilitary group).\n*   **Question:** What object is he holding in his hand, and what is its symbolism as an act of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\nThe painting in question is Curt Querner's \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe), created in 1933. This confirms the subject matter and year.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the historical context.**\nCurt Querner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In March 1933, he was arrested by the SA (a forerunner to the Gestapo in terms of Nazi terror) and was imprisoned in Hohnstein Castle, one of the first concentration camps. He did manage to escape. The painting was created in the aftermath of this traumatic experience, giving it a powerful political and personal charge.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the object held in the painting.**\nAs the title \"Self-Portrait with Pipe\" indicates, and as is visually clear in the artwork, Curt Querner is holding a pipe. He holds it firmly in his right hand, not smoking it, but presenting it to the viewer.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the symbolism of the object.**\nThe pipe is not a casual accessory in this portrait. Given the context, it serves as a powerful symbol of resistance.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Symbol of Defiance and Unbroken Spirit.** After being persecuted and imprisoned for his political beliefs, the act of painting himself with a common, everyday object is an act of defiance. It signifies that the regime could not break his will or crush his spirit.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Symbol of Individuality and Freedom.** In the face of a totalitarian state that sought to control every aspect of life, the simple, personal pleasure of smoking a pipe represents a reclamation of individual freedom and normality. It's a quiet but firm declaration of selfhood.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symbol of Steadfastness.** Querner's expression is grim and determined. The way he clutches the pipe suggests steadfastness and a refusal to be intimidated. He is still himself, grounded and resolute, despite the terror he has faced.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Symbol of Proletarian Identity.** As a painter associated with the working class and a member of the Communist party, the pipe can also be interpreted as an attribute of the common man, reinforcing his political identity in defiance of the Nazis who sought to eradicate such beliefs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn his 1933 self-portrait, painted after his escape from Nazi imprisonment, Curt Querner holds a pipe. It serves as a symbol of his defiant, unbroken will, his steadfastness, and his assertion of individual freedom and identity against the oppressive regime.\n\n<<<A pipe>>>"
