    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of `log_2(n)`, where `n` is the Church integer represented by the given SKI expression. This means we first need to evaluate the expression to find the integer `n`, and then compute its base-2 logarithm.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Expression and Identify Key Components**\n\nThe given expression is:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break this down into smaller, more manageable parts. We can see two recurring, complex sub-expressions.\n\n*   Let `M = S(S(K(S))(K))`.\n*   The numeral for `1` is `I`.\n*   The sub-expression `S(I)(I)` is another component. Let's evaluate it.\n    A Church numeral `k` is a function `k f x = f^k(x)`.\n    `S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`. This is precisely the definition of the Church numeral `2`.\n    So, `S(I)(I) = 2`.\n\nNow we can rewrite the main expression `E` by defining two terms, `A` and `B`:\n*   `A = M(I) = S(S(K(S))(K)) (I)`\n*   `B = M(S(I)(I)) = S(S(K(S))(K)) (2)`\n\nThe expression for `E` can now be written as:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))))(B)`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combinator `M` and Handle a Likely Typo**\n\nThe combinator `M = S(S(K(S))(K))` is very similar to a well-known combinator, the successor function `SUCC`, which increments a Church numeral by one (`SUCC n = n+1`).\n*   `SUCC = S(B) = S(S(K S)K)`\n\nThe expression for `M` in the problem has slightly different parenthesization: `S(S(K(S)))(K))`. If we analyze `M` as written, its application to Church numerals does not yield a Church numeral, leading to a nonsensical result. This strongly suggests that `M` is a typo for `SUCC`. Such typos are common in complex combinator problems.\n\nAssuming `M` is indeed the successor combinator `SUCC`:\n*   `A = SUCC(I) = SUCC(1) = 2`.\n*   `B = SUCC(2) = 3`.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the Values of A and B back into E**\n\nWith `A=2` and `B=3`, the expression becomes:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K 2)))(3)`\n\n**Step 5: Parse and Evaluate the Expression `E`**\n\nThe expression `E` has the form of the `S` combinator applied to three arguments: `S X Y Z`.\n*   `X = I`\n*   `Y = S(I)(S(I)(K 2))`\n*   `Z = 3`\n\nThe reduction rule for `S` is `S X Y Z = X Z (Y Z)`. Applying this to `E`:\n`E = I 3 (Y 3)`\nSince `I a = a`, this simplifies to:\n`E = 3 (Y 3)`\n\nThis means the Church numeral `3` is applied to the result of `Y` applied to `3`. In Church arithmetic, `m n` (where `m` and `n` are numerals) represents exponentiation `n^m` (the base is the right-hand argument).\nSo, `E = (Y 3)^3`.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate `Y 3`**\n\nNow we need to evaluate `Y 3`, where `Y = S(I)(S(I)(K 2))`.\n`Y 3` has the form `S X' Y' Z'` with:\n*   `X' = I`\n*   `Y' = S(I)(K 2)`\n*   `Z' = 3`\n\nReduction gives `I 3 (Y' 3) = 3 (Y' 3)`. So, `Y 3 = (Y' 3)^3`.\n\n**Step 7: Evaluate `Y' 3`**\n\nWe need to evaluate `Y' 3`, where `Y' = S(I)(K 2)`.\n`Y' 3` has the form `S X'' Y'' Z''` with:\n*   `X'' = I`\n*   `Y'' = K 2`\n*   `Z'' = 3`\n\nReduction gives `I 3 (Y'' 3) = 3 (Y'' 3)`.\nNow we evaluate `Y'' 3 = (K 2) 3`.\nThe reduction rule for `K` is `K a b = a`. So, `K 2 3 = 2`.\nTherefore, `Y' 3 = 3 2`.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the Final Value of `n`**\n\nNow we substitute back up the chain.\n*   `Y' 3 = 3 2 = 2^3 = 8`.\n*   `Y 3 = (Y' 3)^3 = 8^3 = 512`.\n*   `E = (Y 3)^3 = 512^3`.\n\nSo, the Church numeral `n` is `512^3`.\n`n = 512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27`.\n\n**Step 9: Calculate log_2(n)**\n\nThe final step is to calculate `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = 27`.\n\n<<<27>>>"
