    "An analysis of the problem of finding the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Properties of the Function `f`**\n\n    *   **Injectivity:** Let's assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. Using the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ is an injective function.\n\n    *   **Monotonicity:** A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is injective must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing). We can therefore split the problem into two cases.\n\n2.  **Case 1: `f` is strictly decreasing.**\n\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then for any $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means that the function $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing.\n    *   The function $g(x) = \\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, so this case is plausible so far.\n    *   However, let's consider the fixed points of $f$. Let $h(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ is a decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is an open interval $(a, b)$, and we have $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = b$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = a$.\n    *   Thus, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} (f(x)-x) = b - (-\\infty) = +\\infty$.\n    *   And $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} (f(x)-x) = a - \\infty = -\\infty$.\n    *   Since $h(x)$ is a continuous function that goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist at least one point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(x_0)=0$. This means $f(x_0) = x_0$. So, $f$ must have a fixed point.\n    *   Let's evaluate the original equation at this fixed point $x_0$:\n        $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$\n        $f(x_0) = \\exp(x_0)$\n        $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$\n    *   The equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions (the line $y=x$ never intersects the graph of $y=e^x$). This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, there are **no strictly decreasing** continuous functions that satisfy the equation.\n\n3.  **Case 2: `f` is strictly increasing.**\n\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   Solutions in this case are known to exist. The theory of functional equations, particularly concerning fractional iterates, provides methods for constructing such functions. A function $f$ satisfying $f \\circ f = g$ is called a functional square root of $g$.\n    *   The general idea of the construction is as follows:\n        1.  Choose a starting point, say $a=1$. Consider the sequence of intervals $I_n = [\\exp^n(1), \\exp^{n+1}(1)]$ for integers $n \\ge 0$.\n        2.  A solution $f$ must map $I_n$ to $I_{n+1/2}$ and $I_{n+1/2}$ to $I_{n+1}$, metaphorically speaking. More formally, $f$ is entirely determined by how it's defined on a \"fundamental\" interval, for example, by choosing a continuous, strictly increasing bijection $\\phi: [a, b] \\to [b, e^a]$, where $f(a)=b$.\n        3.  The crucial point is that we have a significant amount of freedom in defining the function on such an initial interval.\n\n4.  **Determine the Cardinality of the Set of Solutions**\n\n    *   Let $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We need to find $|S|$.\n\n    *   **Upper Bound:** The set $S$ is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. The cardinality of the set of continuous functions on $\\mathbb{R}$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$ (or $2^{\\aleph_0}$). This is because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense countable subset, such as the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The set of all functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. Thus, $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n    *   **Lower Bound:** We need to show that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ distinct solutions. We can demonstrate this by constructing a family of solutions parameterized by a real number.\n        1.  Let's focus on defining a solution. A solution $f$ is determined by choosing a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ that maps an interval $[a, b]$ to $[b, e^a]$ for some $a<b<e^a$.\n        2.  Let's fix $a=1$ and choose any real number $b$ such that $1 < b < e$.\n        3.  We need to define a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\psi: [1, b] \\to [b, e]$ such that $\\psi(1)=b$ and $\\psi(b)=e$. We can choose a different $\\psi$ for each choice of $b$. A simple choice is the linear map: $\\psi_b(x) = b + \\frac{e-b}{b-1}(x-1)$.\n        4.  This function $\\psi_b$ defines $f$ on the interval $[1, b]$. The rest of the function $f$ on the \"orbit\" of the interval $[1,b]$ is then determined by the functional equation. For example, for $x \\in [b,e]$, we must have $x = \\psi_b(y)$ for some $y \\in [1,b]$, and we define $f(x) = f(\\psi_b(y)) = f(f(y)) = e^y = e^{\\psi_b^{-1}(x)}$.\n        5.  This construction can be carefully extended to define a full solution $f_b: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ for each choice of $b \\in (1, e)$.\n        6.  Since different choices of $b$ lead to different functions $\\psi_b$, they result in distinct solutions $f_b$.\n        7.  The interval $(1, e)$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, we have constructed at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ different solutions.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Cardinality:** We have shown that the number of solutions is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at least $\\mathfrak{c}$. By the Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem, the cardinality of the set of solutions must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
