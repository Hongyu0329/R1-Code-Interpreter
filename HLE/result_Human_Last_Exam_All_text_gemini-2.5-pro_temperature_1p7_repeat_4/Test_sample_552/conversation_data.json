    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers. Its full title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Demanded by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Analyze the Term \"Cite\":** In academic terms, a \"citation\" is a formal reference, usually in a footnote or a bibliography, to another work. We must first check if Einstein's paper contains any such formal citations.\n\n4.  **Examine the Historical Record:** Historians of science have thoroughly studied Einstein's 1905 papers. A well-known and often-commented-upon feature of his Brownian motion paper (and his other papers from that year) is that it contains **no formal citations or references**. Einstein did not include a bibliography or footnotes crediting prior work.\n\n5.  **Address the Discrepancy:** Since there are no formal citations, the question's premise is technically incorrect if \"cite\" is interpreted strictly. Therefore, we must consider a broader interpretation. The question likely refers to the person whose ideas and work (specifically in lecture format) were the acknowledged intellectual foundation for Einstein's paper.\n\n6.  **Investigate Einstein's Influences:** We need to find out which scientist's work, particularly lectures, provided the theoretical framework for Einstein's paper.\n    *   The paper's title explicitly mentions the \"molecular-kinetic theory of heat.\"\n    *   The primary architect of this theory was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**.\n    *   In his own autobiographical notes, Einstein stated that he studied the works of key physicists on his own, as he found the university lectures he attended to be outdated.\n    *   He specifically mentioned having read and studied Ludwig Boltzmann's book **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\")**.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the Findings:** Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion is a direct application of the principles of statistical mechanics laid out by Ludwig Boltzmann. Although Einstein did not formally cite Boltzmann *in the paper itself*, he later acknowledged the profound influence of Boltzmann's work, which he had studied through his published lectures (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, while Einstein did not include any formal citations in his paper, the clear intellectual antecedent whose lectures (in published form) he drew upon was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
