    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial position of the first cube.**\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can define its boundaries by the set of points `(x, y, z)` such that:\n*   `0 <= x <= 1`\n*   `0 <= y <= 1`\n*   `0 <= z <= 1`\nThe volume of Cube A is `1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift and define the position of the second cube.**\nThe second cube, Cube B, is a copy of Cube A shifted \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Main Diagonal.** The main diagonal of Cube A connects opposite vertices, for example, the origin `(0, 0, 0)` and the far vertex `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is `d = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpreting the Shift.** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most commonly interpreted to mean that the shift vector is `1/2` times the diagonal vector.\n    *   Shift vector `v = (1/2) * d = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\nNow, we find the position of Cube B by adding this shift vector to the coordinates of Cube A. The boundaries for Cube B are:\n*   `0 + 1/2 <= x <= 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 <= x <= 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 <= y <= 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 <= y <= 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 <= z <= 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 <= z <= 3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the region of intersection.**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the set of points `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the boundary conditions for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We need to find the intersection of the coordinate intervals for each axis.\n\n*   **For the x-axis:** A point in the intersection must have an x-coordinate that is in both `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the y-axis:** Similarly, the y-coordinate must be in both `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the z-axis:** The z-coordinate must also be in both `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the shape of the intersection.** The resulting region of intersection is defined by:\n    *   `1/2 <= x <= 1`\n    *   `1/2 <= y <= 1`\n    *   `1/2 <= z <= 1`\nThis is a cube.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe intersection is a cube. We need to find its side length to calculate its volume.\n\n*   The length of the side along the x-axis is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   The length of the side along the y-axis is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   The length of the side along the z-axis is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\nThe volume of this smaller cube (the intersection) is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the volume calculated in the last step.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
