    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium point, then calculate the consumer and producer surplus, and finally sum them up.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium (Qe, Pe):** We will set the supply and demand equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity (Qe). Since the resulting equation, `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`, is a transcendental equation, we will use a numerical solver in Python to find its root, Qe. The equilibrium price (Pe) is then found by substituting Qe into either the supply or demand function.\n2.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** Consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and the equilibrium price line. It is calculated by integrating the demand function from 0 to Qe and subtracting the rectangle formed by Pe * Qe.\n    *   `CS = ∫[0 to Qe] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - Pe * Qe`\n3.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** Producer surplus is the area between the equilibrium price line and the supply curve. The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q > 2^(1/3)`. Therefore, the integral for producer surplus will be from this minimum quantity to Qe.\n    *   `PS = Pe * Qe - ∫[2^(1/3) to Qe] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** The total welfare is the sum of the consumer and producer surplus.\n    *   `Total Welfare = CS + PS`\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan using the `scipy` library for numerical solving and integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_print_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the steps to find the total welfare\n    from the given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Supply and Demand Functions\n    # Demand: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n    def demand_func(q):\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n    # Supply: P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)\n    def supply_func(q):\n        # This function is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0, or Q > 2^(1/3)\n        with np.errstate(invalid='ignore'):\n            return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\n    # Equation to find equilibrium: Demand(Q) - Supply(Q) = 0\n    def equilibrium_equation(q):\n        return demand_func(q) - supply_func(q)\n\n    print(\"--- Market Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Supply Function: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\")\n    print(\"Demand Function: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n\n    # Step 2: Find Market Equilibrium\n    # We need an initial guess for the solver.
