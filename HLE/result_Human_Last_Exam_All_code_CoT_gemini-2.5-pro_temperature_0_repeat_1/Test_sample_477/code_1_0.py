    # Step 1: Define the components of the problem.
    explanation_dm1 = """
    Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a genetic disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene. A key feature of DM1 is 'somatic instability,' where these repeats tend to expand further in an individual's cells over time, worsening the disease.
    """

    # Step 2: Explain the mechanism of instability.
    explanation_mechanism = """
    This instability primarily occurs during DNA replication. The repetitive CTG sequence on the lagging DNA strand can form stable hairpin structures. The cellular machinery that replicates and repairs DNA can process these hairpins in a way that leads to the incorporation of extra repeats, causing an expansion.
    """

    # Step 3: Describe the specific role of LIG1.
    explanation_lig1_role = """
    DNA Ligase I (LIG1) is a critical enzyme in this process. Its main function during replication is to join Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand, sealing the final gap in the DNA backbone. In the context of DM1, LIG1 is responsible for the final step that makes the repeat expansion permanent in the DNA strand.
    """

    # Step 4: Conclude the impact of knocking out LIG1.
    conclusion = """
    Therefore, if LIG1 is absent or its function is significantly reduced (knocked out or knocked down), this critical final step of the expansion pathway is blocked. The machinery can no longer efficiently incorporate the extra repeats. This leads to a significant decrease in the rate of CTG repeat expansions, resulting in reduced somatic instability.
    """

    # Step 5: Select the correct answer from the choices.
    final_answer_explanation = """
    Based on this mechanism, knocking out LIG1 has a stabilizing effect on the CTG repeats.
    
    - A. Increased instability: Incorrect. LIG1 promotes instability.
    - B. Contraction of repeat length: While possible, the primary effect is a reduction in expansions.
    - C. Reduced instability: Correct. Removing a key enzyme in the expansion pathway reduces the rate of expansion.
    - D. No impact: Incorrect. LIG1 is a key player.
    - E. Knockout is lethal: While true for an organism, in the context of the molecular mechanism, the impact on the repeats is reduced instability.
    
    The correct choice is C.
