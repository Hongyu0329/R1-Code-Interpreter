The reaction is a classic anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement, which occurs in three main stages:
1.  Deprotonation: The strong base Potassium Hydride (KH) deprotonates the tertiary alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide intermediate. Hydrogen gas (H2) is evolved as a byproduct.
2.  [3,3]-Sigmatropic Rearrangement: The alkoxide, which is part of a 1,5-diene system, undergoes a rapid intramolecular [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. This process breaks the strained C1-C2 bond of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core and forms a new C-C bond, resulting in a new, more stable tricyclic carbon skeleton. This step produces an enolate intermediate.
3.  Workup and Tautomerization: The addition of H2O/MeOH protonates the enolate intermediate to form an enol, which quickly tautomerizes to the final, stable ketone product.
