    "To find an approximate analytical solution for the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the large $x$ regime, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE for large x**: The given ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$. As $x \\to \\infty$, some terms become negligible compared to others.\n    *   The term $\\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2}$ approaches zero, as the denominator grows quadratically with $x$.\n    *   The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x) + 1}$ is an oscillatory function. For the long-term, non-oscillatory (asymptotic) behavior, we can neglect its contribution compared to potentially dominant power-law terms.\n    *   This simplifies the ODE to $y''' \\approx y^{4} + y'^{4}$.\n\n2.  **Dominant Balance Analysis**: To solve this simplified non-linear ODE, I will assume a solution of the form $y(x) = C x^n$. The derivatives are then $y'(x) \\sim x^{n-1}$, $y''(x) \\sim x^{n-2}$, and $y'''(x) \\sim x^{n-3}$. Substituting these into the simplified ODE, we compare the powers of $x$ for each term:\n    *   $y''' \\sim x^{n-3}$\n    *   $y^4 \\sim (x^n)^4 = x^{4n}$\n    *   $y'^4 \\sim (x^{n-1})^4 = x^{4n-4}$\n\n    To find a balance, we equate the exponents of the two dominant terms. The only consistent balance for large $x$ is between the $y'''$ and $y^4$ terms. This requires their powers to be equal:\n    $n - 3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$.\n    With $n=-1$, the powers are: $y''' \\sim x^{-4}$, $y^4 \\sim x^{-4}$, and $y'^4 \\sim x^{-8}$. The $y'^4$ term is indeed negligible for large $x$ compared to the other two.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Coefficient C**: Now we use the dominant balance equation $y''' \\approx y^4$ and our solution form $y(x) = C x^{-1}$.\n    *   First, we find the third derivative:\n        $y'(x) = -C x^{-2}$\n        $y''(x) = 2C x^{-3}$\n        $y'''(x) = -6C x^{-4}$\n    *   Substitute $y'''$ and $y$ into the balance equation:\n        $-6C x^{-4} = (C x^{-1})^4 = C^4 x^{-4}$\n    *   This gives an algebraic equation for C: $-6C = C^4$, which simplifies to $C^4 + 6C = 0$.\n    *   This equation has two real solutions: a trivial one $C=0$, and a non-trivial one from $C^3 + 6 = 0$, which is $C = \\sqrt[3]{-6}$.\n\n4.  **Construct the Final Expression**: The python code below will calculate the numerical value of $C = -\\sqrt[3]{6}$, round it to two decimal places, and then print the final analytical expression for $y(x)$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the equation for the coefficient C.\n# From the dominant balance analysis, we have the equation C^3 = -6.\n\n# Step 2: Solve for C.\n# We need the real cube root of -6.\n# C = (-6)^(1/3) = - (6)^(1/3)\nC = -math.pow(6, 1/3)\n\n# Step 3: Round the coefficient to two decimal places as requested.\nC_rounded = round(C, 2)\n\n# Step 4: The power of x, n, was found to be -1.\nn = -1\n\n# Step 5: Construct and print the final analytical expression.\n# The expression is y(x) = C / x.\n# The numbers in this equation are the coefficient C and the power n.\nprint(f\"The approximate analytical expression for y(x) in the large x regime is of the form: y(x) = C * x^n\")\nprint(f\"The value for the power is n = {n}\")\nprint(f\"The value for the coefficient is C = {C_rounded:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final expression is:\")\nprint(f\"y(x) = {C_rounded:.2f} / x\")\n\n```\n<<<y(x) = -1.82 / x>>>"
