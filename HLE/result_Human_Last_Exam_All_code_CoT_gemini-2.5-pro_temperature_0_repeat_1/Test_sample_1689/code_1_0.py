    # The question asks for the best *next step in diagnosis*. We need to find the
    # test that will confirm this suspected diagnosis and identify the specific cause.

    # Let's evaluate the choices:
    # A. Skin biopsy: This is invasive and not the first-line test for a classic
    #    presentation of contact dermatitis.
    # B. KOH preparation: This tests for fungal infections, which is not the primary
    #    suspicion here.
    # C. Topical steroid: This is a form of treatment, not a diagnostic tool.
    # D. Patch test: This is the gold standard for identifying the specific allergen
    #    causing allergic contact dermatitis. It is the most appropriate next step
    #    to confirm the diagnosis.
    # E. None of the above.
