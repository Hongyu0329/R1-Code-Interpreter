# Based on the analysis, the complex second term of the function does not
# contribute to the 4th Maclaurin coefficient. The problem simplifies
# to finding the coefficient from the first term.
# The first term is f1(x) = (9 * x^4) / (16 * e).
# The coefficient of x^4 is 9 / (16 * e).

# The final equation for the coefficient C is:
# C = numerator / (denominator_constant * e)
numerator = 9
denominator_constant = 16
e_val = math.e

# Calculate the coefficient
coefficient = numerator / (denominator_constant * e_val)
