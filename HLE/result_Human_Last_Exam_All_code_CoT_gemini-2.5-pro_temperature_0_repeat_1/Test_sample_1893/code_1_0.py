    """
    This script calculates a specific eigenvalue of the neutralino mass matrix
    under the condition of dynamic enhancement of radiative decay.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. The physical condition of "dynamic enhancement" implies that the states
       -i*gamma-tilde and H_b-tilde are mass eigenstates. This imposes the
       mathematical constraints M_1 = M_2 and cos(2*beta) = 0 on the matrix.
    2. The question asks for the eigenvalue not proportional to the adjustable
       parameters M_1, M_2, or mu. This points to a special case where these
       parameters are zero, leaving an eigenvalue that depends only on the
       constant M_Z.
    3. We construct the matrix for this specific case (M_1 = M_2 = mu = 0)
       and find its eigenvalues.
    4. The characteristic equation for the relevant part of the matrix and its
       solution will be printed.
