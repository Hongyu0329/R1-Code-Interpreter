# Step 1: Define the problem parameters.
# The set S is defined for the function f(x) = (2*x + sin(2*pi*x))/3.
# S = {x_0 in [0,1] | the sequence x_{n+1} = f(x_n) has exactly 7 distinct values}.
# We need to find the Lebesgue measure of S, denoted as m(S).

# Step 2: Characterize the points in S.
# A sequence has a finite number of distinct values if and only if it is pre-periodic.
# This means for any x_0 in S, there exist integers n > k >= 0 such that f^n(x_0) = f^k(x_0).
# The set S is a subset of the set of all pre-periodic points of f.

# Step 3: Analyze the mathematical nature of the set of pre-periodic points.
# The function f(x) is real analytic. Any composition or difference of real analytic
# functions is also real analytic.
# The pre-periodic points are the roots of equations of the form g(x) = f^n(x) - f^k(x) = 0.
# For n != k, g(x) is a non-zero real analytic function.
# The set of roots of any non-zero real analytic function is a countable set.

# Step 4: Determine the measure of a countable set.
# The set of all pre-periodic points is a countable union of countable sets, which is itself countable.
# The Lebesgue measure of any countable set of real numbers is 0.
# Therefore, the set S, being a countable set, has a Lebesgue measure of 0.

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
measure_of_S = 0.0
multiplier = 10**6
final_result = measure_of_S * multiplier

# Step 6: Print the reasoning and the final equation as requested.
print("The set S consists of pre-periodic points with an orbit size of 7.")
print("For the given analytic function f(x), the set of all pre-periodic points is a countable set.")
print("The Lebesgue measure of any countable set is 0.")
print("Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of S is 0.")
