# Define symbols
T, a, w, theta = sympy.symbols('mathcal{T} a omega theta')

# The calculated T_thetatheta component
# From our derivation, T_thetatheta_calc = T * a**4 * w**2
T_thetatheta_calc = T * a**4 * w**2

# The given form for T_thetatheta
# T_thetatheta_given = a**2 * sympy.sin(theta)**2 * T + K
K = sympy.Symbol('K')
T_thetatheta_given = a**2 * sympy.sin(theta)**2 * T + K

# The problem states that T_thetatheta_calc must be equal to T_thetatheta_given for all theta.
# This gives the equation:
equation = sympy.Eq(T_thetatheta_calc, T_thetatheta_given)

# For this equation to hold for all theta, the theta-dependent parts must vanish.
# We can see this by differentiating with respect to theta.
# d(lhs)/d(theta) = 0
# d(rhs)/d(theta) = a**2 * T * 2 * sin(theta) * cos(theta)
# So, a**2 * T * 2 * sin(theta) * cos(theta) must be 0 for all theta.
# This implies a**2 * T = 0.

# If a**2 * T = 0, then the left side of the equation is also zero:
# T_thetatheta_calc = (a**2 * T) * a**2 * w**2 = 0
# And the theta-dependent term on the right side is also zero.
# The equation becomes: 0 = 0 + K

# Solve for K
final_K = 0

# The final equation is T_thetatheta = a^2 * sin^2(theta) * T + K
# Our calculation shows T_thetatheta = T * a^4 * w^2
# Equating them: T * a^4 * w^2 = a^2 * sin^2(theta) * T + K
# As reasoned above, this implies K=0.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation for K is 0 = 0 + K, which simplifies to K = 0.
# The numbers are 0, 0, 1. We will print the value of K.
