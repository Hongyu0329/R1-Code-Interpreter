    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, where uniqueness is defined \"up to translation and rotation\".\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent a Grid Diagram**: A grid diagram on an `n x n` grid can be represented by two permutations, `X` and `O`, of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. `X[c] = r` means there is an 'X' at column `c` and row `r`. Similarly for `O`. The minimal grid number (`n`) for a trefoil knot is 3. A known minimal diagram for the left-hand trefoil is `X = [0, 2, 1]` and `O = [1, 0, 2]`.\n\n2.  **Define Equivalence**:\n    *   **Translation**: Two diagrams are equivalent by translation if one can be obtained from the other by cyclically shifting the rows and/or columns. We can define a *canonical form* for each translational equivalence class, for example, by taking the lexicographically smallest diagram among all `n*n` possible translations.\n    *   **Rotation**: A diagram can be rotated by 90, 180, or 270 degrees. We will implement a function to perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on the permutation representation.\n\n3.  **Find All Unique Diagrams**: We can find all unique diagrams by starting with our initial left-hand trefoil diagram and exploring all diagrams that can be reached through rotation. We'll use a search algorithm (like Breadth-First Search) to do this systematically.\n    *   We'll maintain a set of the canonical forms of all unique diagrams we've found.\n    *   We'll use a queue to keep track of diagrams to process.\n    *   Start by adding the canonical form of the initial diagram to our set and the diagram itself to the queue.\n    *   Repeatedly take a diagram from the queue, generate its rotations, and for each rotation, compute its canonical form. If the canonical form is new, add it to our set and add the rotated diagram to the queue.\n    *   The process stops when the queue is empty. The final answer is the total number of unique canonical forms found.\n\nThis process counts the number of orbits of the set of minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil under the group of actions generated by translations and rotations.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_canonical(X, O):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the canonical representation of a diagram under translation.\n    The canonical form is the lexicographically smallest of all n*n translations.\n    A translation is a cyclic shift of columns by p and rows by q.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(X)\n    translations = []\n    for p in range(n):  # Iterate through all column shifts\n        for q in range(n):  # Iterate through all row shifts\n            X_new = [0] * n\n            O_new = [0] * n\n            for i in range(n):\n                # Apply column shift p\n                col_shifted_i = (i + p) % n\n                # Apply row shift q\n                X_new[col_shifted_i] = (X[i] + q) % n\n                O_new[col_shifted_i] = (O[i] + q) % n\n            translations.append((tuple(X_new), tuple(O_new)))\n    \n    # Return the lexicographically smallest translation\n    return min(translations)\n\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(X, O):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotates a grid diagram 90 degrees clockwise.\n    A point at (row, col) moves to (col, n-1-row).\n    This translates to a transformation on the permutation pair.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(X)\n    X_new = [0] * n\n    O_new = [0] * n\n    \n    # For X\n    for c, r in enumerate(X):\n        new_r, new_c = c, n - 1 - r\n        X_new[new_r] = new_c\n        \n    # For O\n    for c, r in enumerate(O):\n        new_r, new_c = c, n - 1 - r\n        O_new[new_r] = new_c\n        \n    return (tuple(X_new), tuple(O_new))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil\n    up to translation and rotation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A minimal grid diagram (n=3) for the left-hand trefoil knot.\n    # Using 0-based indexing for permutations.\n    initial_X = (0, 2, 1)\n    initial_O = (1, 0, 2)\n    \n    # Use a queue for BFS and a set to store unique canonical forms\n    q = collections.deque([(initial_X, initial_O)])\n    initial_canonical = get_canonical(initial_X, initial_O)\n    found_canonical_forms = {initial_canonical}\n    \n    print(\"Starting with the initial diagram for the left-hand trefoil:\")\n    print(f\"  X = {list(initial_X)}, O = {list(initial_O)}\")\n    print(f\"Its canonical form is: {initial_canonical}\\n\")\n    \n    processed_count = 0\n    while q:\n        current_X, current_O = q.popleft()\n        processed_count += 1\n        \n        diagram_to_rotate = (current_X, current_O)\n        \n        # Generate 90, 180, 270 degree rotations\n        for i in range(3):\n            diagram_to_rotate = rotate_90_clockwise(diagram_to_rotate[0], diagram_to_rotate[1])\n            \n            # Get the canonical form of the rotated diagram\n            canonical_form = get_canonical(diagram_to_rotate[0], diagram_to_rotate[1])\n            \n            # If this canonical form has not been seen before, add it\n            if canonical_form not in found_canonical_forms:\n                found_canonical_forms.add(canonical_form)\n                q.append(diagram_to_rotate)\n\n    print(\"The unique canonical forms found are:\")\n    for i, (X, O) in enumerate(sorted(list(found_canonical_forms))):\n        print(f\"{i+1}: X={list(X)}, O={list(O)}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of unique grid diagrams is the number of canonical forms found.\")\n    print(f\"Final count: {len(found_canonical_forms)}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
