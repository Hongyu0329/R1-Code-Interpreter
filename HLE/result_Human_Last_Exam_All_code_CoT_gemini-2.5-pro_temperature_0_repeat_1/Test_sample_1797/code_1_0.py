    This function identifies the incorrect statement about attack graph analysis.

    A. Correct. Describes the graph structure and common analysis techniques.
    B. Correct. Describes the state explosion problem.
    C. Correct. Describes the computational complexity and need for heuristics.
    D. Correct. Describes the dynamic nature of attack graphs.
    E. Incorrect. This statement reverses the role of model checking. Model checking is used to *generate* the attack graph by finding violations of a security property on a system model, not to verify properties *on* the attack graph itself.

    The only incorrect statement is E.
