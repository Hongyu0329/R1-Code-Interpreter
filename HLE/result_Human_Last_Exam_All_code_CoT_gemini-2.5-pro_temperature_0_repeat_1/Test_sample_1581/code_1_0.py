    This function solves the topology problem about homeomorphism classes.

    Problem Statement:
    Suppose X is a compact connected metric space, and for some n >= 2 the subspace
    C_n(X) = {(x_1, ..., x_n): all x_i in X are distinct} of X^n is disconnected.
    How many distinct homeomorphism classes are there for such X?

    Reasoning:
    1. The space C_n(X) is the configuration space of n distinct ordered points in X.
    2. The connectivity of C_n(X) is a fundamental topological property of X.

    3. Let's analyze the condition that C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2.
       - If X is a topological arc (i.e., homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1]),
         it possesses a total ordering. This ordering can be used to partition C_n(X)
         into n! disjoint open sets, one for each permutation of the n points.
         For n >= 2, this means C_n(X) is disconnected.
         So, the class of topological arcs satisfies the condition.

       - If X is NOT a topological arc, a key theorem in topology states that C_n(X)
         is connected for all n >= 2. The intuitive reason is that a space which is
         not an arc must contain a "loop" (like a circle) or a "branch point"
         (like the center of a 'Y' shape). These features allow points to be navigated
         around each other, meaning any configuration can be continuously transformed
         into any of its permutations. This ensures the connectivity of C_n(X).

    4. Conclusion: The condition that C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2 holds
       if and only if X is a topological arc.

    5. The question asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for such X.
       Since all such spaces X are, by definition, homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1],
       they all belong to the same single homeomorphism class.

    6. Therefore, the number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
