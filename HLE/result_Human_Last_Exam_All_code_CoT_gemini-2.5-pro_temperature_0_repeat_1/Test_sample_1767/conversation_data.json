    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The key physical principle here is the additivity of the Chern number. The Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a material. When two systems are combined, their topological invariants add up.\n2.  **Define the variables:** We have two Chern insulators. Let's call their Chern numbers C1 and C2. According to the problem, C1 = 1 and C2 = 1.\n3.  **Formulate the equation:** The Chern number of the combined system, let's call it C_total, is the sum of the individual Chern numbers: C_total = C1 + C2.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute the given values into the equation to find the final answer.\n5.  **Generate the Python code:** Write a Python script that implements these steps, explains the principle, and prints the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators.\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number is an additive topological quantum number. When two\n# Chern insulators are joined together with a negligible tunneling barrier,\n# the resulting system can be described by a total Chern number that is\n# the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n# The counter-propagating edge states at the interface gap out,\n# leaving a new bulk system with a combined topological charge.\n\n# Calculate the total Chern number of the junction.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation.\nprint(\"The Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the first insulator (C1): {c1}\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the second insulator (C2): {c2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total Chern number (C_total) is C1 + C2.\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{c_total} = {c1} + {c2}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 that connects laterally and have negligible tunneling barrier, what is the Chern number of this junction. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
