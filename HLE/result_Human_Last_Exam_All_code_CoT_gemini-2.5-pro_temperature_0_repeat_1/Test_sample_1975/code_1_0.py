    # The problem asks for the order type of the set X.
    # X is the set of infinite cardinals mu for which a "free set" of size mu exists.
    # The cardinal kappa is omega_7.

    # Based on the properties of a head tail weak Delta-system and the regularity of kappa,
    # we can prove that a free set of size kappa exists.
    # The argument relies on a greedy construction of the free set, showing that at each
    # step of the construction, the set of forbidden elements is smaller than kappa.

    # Step 1: Determine the members of the set X.
    # The existence of a free set of size kappa = omega_7 implies that omega_7 is in X.
    # If a set is free, any of its infinite subsets is also free.
    # Therefore, all infinite cardinals mu <= omega_7 are in X.
    # These cardinals are: omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7.
    print("The set X consists of the cardinals omega_n for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.")

    # Step 2: Determine the order type of X.
    # The order type of this set of cardinals, under the usual ordering, is its cardinality.
    # We count the number of elements in the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
    first_index = 0
    last_index = 7
    
    # The final equation to find the number of elements:
    order_type = last_index - first_index + 1
    
    print("The order type of X is the number of elements in it.")
    print(f"The calculation is: {last_index} - {first_index} + 1")
