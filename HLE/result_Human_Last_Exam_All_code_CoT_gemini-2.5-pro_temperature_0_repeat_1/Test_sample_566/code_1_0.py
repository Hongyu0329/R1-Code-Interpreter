    1.  **CARS Basics:** Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy uses laser beams to probe the vibrational modes of molecules. The signal, an anti-Stokes beam, is generated at a frequency of ω_as = ω_p + ω_pr - ω_s, where ω_p is the pump frequency, ω_s is the Stokes frequency, and ω_pr is the probe frequency. The process is resonant when the frequency difference (ω_p - ω_s) matches a molecular vibration frequency, Ω.

    2.  **Broadband CARS (B-CARS):** The goal of B-CARS is to acquire a full vibrational spectrum simultaneously. This is done by using one broadband laser beam and keeping the other(s) narrowband.

    3.  **Analyzing the Scenario (Broadband Pump):** The question specifies a broadband pump beam, let's call its frequency range {ω_p}. To excite a range of vibrations {Ω}, a narrowband Stokes beam (ω_s) is used. The range of excited vibrations is given by {Ω} = {ω_p} - ω_s.

    4.  **Signal Generation and Detection:** A probe beam (ω_pr) then interacts with this range of excited vibrations {Ω} to produce the anti-Stokes signal at {ω_as} = ω_pr + {Ω}. To ensure that the resulting signal {ω_as} is a clean spectrum where each frequency corresponds to a specific vibration Ω, the probe beam (ω_pr) must be narrowband.

    5.  **Conclusion:** If the experiment is set up correctly (broadband pump, narrowband Stokes, narrowband probe), the resulting anti-Stokes beam will be broadband, and its spectrum will contain distinguishable information about the different vibrational modes of the sample. Therefore, it is true that you can generate an anti-Stokes beam that contains distinguishable information.
