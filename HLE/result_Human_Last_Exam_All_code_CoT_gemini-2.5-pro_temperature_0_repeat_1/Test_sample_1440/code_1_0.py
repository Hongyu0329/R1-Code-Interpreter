        "It is possible to construct a continuum X that satisfies all the properties and has exactly 3 equivalence classes.",
        "Such a construction typically involves joining three special continua (e.g., indecomposable continua) in a way that each becomes a nowhere dense subcontinuum of the whole space.",
