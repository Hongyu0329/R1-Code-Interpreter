    print("   Answer: Yes")
    print("   Explanation: The transformation for time is t' = γ_E * (t + v*x/c^2). Since the time t' in the moving frame depends on the position x in the original frame, two events that are simultaneous in the original frame (same t) but at different locations (different x) will not be simultaneous in the moving frame.")
