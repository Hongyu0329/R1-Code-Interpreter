    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can use a computational approach. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Generate all candidates:** We will use the `networkx` library in Python, which provides a pre-computed atlas of all simple nonisomorphic graphs up to 7 vertices. We will filter this atlas to get the list of all 34 nonisomorphic graphs with exactly 5 vertices.\n2.  **Check connectivity:** For each of these 34 graphs, we will determine its vertex connectivity. A graph is k-vertex-connected if it remains connected after removing any k-1 vertices.\n    *   Connectivity 0: The graph is disconnected.\n    *   Connectivity 1: The graph is connected but has at least one \"cut vertex\" (or articulation point), which, if removed, would disconnect the graph.\n    *   Connectivity 2 or more: The graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected). It has no cut vertices.\n3.  **Count and Conclude:** We will count the number of graphs that fall into the 2-vertex-connected category. To satisfy the prompt's requirement for an \"equation\", we will show the breakdown of the total 34 graphs into their connectivity classes.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve_graph_counting():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple\n    nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices by iterating through the networkx\n    graph atlas.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Get all nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices from the atlas.\n        all_graphs_from_atlas = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n        graphs_n5 = [g for g in all_graphs_from_atlas if g.number_of_vertices() == 5]\n        total_graphs = len(graphs_n5)\n\n        # Step 2: Categorize each graph by its vertex connectivity.\n        # We will count graphs with connectivity 0 (disconnected), 1, and >=2.\n        connectivity_counts = {0: 0, 1: 0, '2+': 0}\n\n        for g in graphs_n5:\n            # A graph must have more than one vertex to compute connectivity.\n            # All our graphs have 5 vertices, so this is fine.\n            if not nx.is_connected(g):\n                # Disconnected graphs have vertex connectivity 0.\n                connectivity_counts[0] += 1\n            else:\n                # For connected graphs, find the node connectivity.\n                conn = nx.node_connectivity(g)\n                if conn == 1:\n                    # 1-vertex-connected (has a cut vertex).\n                    connectivity_counts[1] += 1\n                else:\n                    # 2-vertex-connected or more (biconnected).\n                    # For n=5, max connectivity is n-1=4.\n                    connectivity_counts['2+'] += 1\n        \n        disconnected_count = connectivity_counts[0]\n        one_connected_count = connectivity_counts[1]\n        two_or_more_connected_count = connectivity_counts['2+']\n\n        # Step 3: Print the results, including the \"equation\".\n        print(f\"Analysis of simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices:\")\n        print(f\"Total number of graphs = {total_graphs}\")\n        print(f\" - Number of disconnected graphs (connectivity 0) = {disconnected_count}\")\n        print(f\" - Number of 1-connected graphs (separable) = {one_connected_count}\")\n        print(f\" - Number of 2-vertex-connected graphs (biconnected) = {two_or_more_connected_count}\")\n        \n        print(\"\\nThe final count can be represented by the equation:\")\n        print(f\"{total_graphs} (Total) - {disconnected_count} (Disconnected) - {one_connected_count} (1-Connected) = {two_or_more_connected_count}\")\n        \n        print(f\"\\nThus, the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is {two_or_more_connected_count}.\")\n\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"NetworkX library not found.
