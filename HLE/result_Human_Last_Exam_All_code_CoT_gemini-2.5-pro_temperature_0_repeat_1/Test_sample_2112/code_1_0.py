# The problem reduces to solving for r0 from the equation derived in the plan.
# The equation is r0 = (4 + 37 * sqrt(2)) / (3 * sqrt(2) - 1).
# We will now calculate this value.

# The numbers in the final equation are 4, 37, 2, 3, 1.
numerator_val = 4 + 37 * math.sqrt(2)
denominator_val = 3 * math.sqrt(2) - 1

r0 = numerator_val / denominator_val
