# Helper class to represent numbers in Titan's fractional/scientific notation
# A number is represented as (numerator, denominator, exponent)

        # All numerators and denominators must be within the 4-bit range (0-15)
        if not (0 <= n <= 15 and 0 < d <= 15):
            # This would raise an error on the actual hardware.

# --- Step 1 & 2: Define Constants and Simplify Model ---
# The full model of a core + oblate shell leads to intermediate numbers
# far exceeding the 4-bit limit (e.g., 2000^3).
# We must simplify.
# Simplification: Ignore the planet's core and its slight oblateness.
# Model Pandora as a uniform sphere with radius r = 2000 km and density rho = 0.3 t/m^3.
# This is justified as the core's mass is <0.1% of the total mass.

# Constants in Titan's 4-bit fractional representation
H = TitanNumber(5, 1, 3)  # h = 5000 m
R = TitanNumber(2, 1, 6)  # r = 2000 km = 2e6 m
RHO = TitanNumber(3, 1, 2) # rho = 300 kg/m^3
PI = TitanNumber(3, 1, 0)  # pi approx 3
G = TitanNumber(13, 2, -11) # G approx 6.5e-11 N m^2/kg^2

# --- Step 3: Calculate Gravitational Acceleration (g) ---
# The formula is g = (4/3) * pi * G * r * rho
# Direct calculation of the product (4/3)*pi*G*r*rho would overflow the 4-bit registers.
# For example, 4 * 13 (from G) = 52, which is > 15.
#
# Key Insight: We use a pre-computed approximation for a group of constants.
# The value of (pi * G * r * rho) is:
# 3.14159 * (6.674e-11) * (2e6) * 300 = 0.1257...
# This is extremely close to 1/8 = 0.125.
# We can use this high-precision approximation, as allowed by the rules.
# Let's call this combined term K.
K = TitanNumber(1, 8, 0) # K = pi * G * r * rho

print("Calculating gravitational acceleration g:")
print(f"g = 4/3 * (pi * G * r * rho)")
print(f"Using pre-computed approximation: pi * G * r * rho ≈ {K}")
# Now, g = 4/3 * K
# MOV AX, 4/3
# MUL AX, 1/8
# This results in 4/24, which reduces to 1/6.
g_val_n, g_val_d = 4 * K.n, 3 * K.d # 4/24
# Simplify fraction by dividing by GCD(4, 24) = 4
g_n, g_d = g_val_n // 4, g_val_d // 4 # 1/6
g = TitanNumber(g_n, g_d, 0)
print(f"g = 4/3 * 1/8 = 4/24 = {g}\n")

# --- Step 4: Calculate t^2 = 2h/g ---
print("Calculating the term inside the square root for t = sqrt(2h/g):")
# 2 * h = 2 * 5e3 = 1e4
two_h = TitanNumber(1, 1, 4)
print(f"2 * h = 2 * {H.to_float()} = {two_h.to_float()}")
print(f"g = {g}")
# N = 2h / g = (1e4) / (1/6) = 6e4

N = TitanNumber(6, 1, 4)
print(f"N = 2h/g = {two_h.to_float()} / {g} = {N}\n")


# --- Step 5 & 6: Calculate Square Root with Approximation ---
# We need to calculate t = sqrt(N) = sqrt(60000).
# Advanced functions like sqrt are prohibited. We use the Newton-Raphson iterative method.
# Formula: x_next = 1/2 * (x_prev + N / x_prev)
print("Calculating t = sqrt(60000) using Newton-Raphson method:")

# Iteration 0: Initial Guess
# sqrt(60000) is between 200 (sqrt(40000)) and 300 (sqrt(90000)).
# Let's choose a valid Titan number as a guess.

print(f"x0 (initial guess) = {x0.to_float()}")

# Iteration 1:
# N / x0 = 6e4 / 2e2 = 3e2 = 300
N_div_x0 = TitanNumber(3, 1, 2)
# x0 + N/x0 = 200 + 300 = 500
x0_plus_N_div_x0 = TitanNumber(5, 1, 2)

# Iteration 2:
# N / x1 = 6e4 / 250 = 240
N_div_x1 = TitanNumber(12, 5, 2) # 2.4 * 10^2 = 240
# x1 + N/x1 = 250 + 240 = 490
# On Titan, this addition (5/2 + 12/5) would result in 49/10, which has an invalid numerator.
# The expression would be (4 + 9/10).
# x2 = 1/2 * 490 = 245
x2_val = 245.0
print(f"x2 = 1/2 * ({x1.to_float()} + {N.to_float()}/{x1.to_float()}) = 1/2 * ({x1.to_float()} + {N_div_x1.to_float()}) = 1/2 * 490 = {x2_val}")

# Constraint Maintenance: The result 245 cannot be represented as n/d * 10^e
# where n and d are <= 15.
# e.g., 245/1 or 49/2 * 10^1 or 49/20 * 10^2 all contain invalid numbers.
# Per rule 4, "precision may be sacrificed to maintain the 4-bit constraint".
# We must approximate 245 to the nearest representable Titan number.
# Possible approximations: 240 (12/5 * 10^2) or 250 (5/2 * 10^2).
# Both are equally close (distance of 5). We choose 240 as it gives a smaller final error.
