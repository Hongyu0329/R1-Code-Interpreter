    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Representations and Partitions:** The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. An integer partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the **hook-length formula**. The formula is:\n    $$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{ij}}$$\n    where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook-length of the cell. The hook-length of a cell is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus the cell itself.\n\n3.  **Algorithm:**\n    *   Set $n=25$ and the dimension threshold to 500,000.\n    *   Generate all possible integer partitions of 25. The total number of partitions of 25 is 1,958.\n    *   For each partition:\n        *   Calculate the dimension of its corresponding irrep using the hook-length formula.\n        *   Check if the calculated dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n        *   If it is, increment a counter and print the partition and its dimension.\n    *   Finally, print the total count.\n\n4.  **Implementation:** The following Python script implements this plan. It uses Python's built-in support for large integers, which is necessary because 25! is a very large number. The script will:\n    *   Define a function to generate all partitions of 25.\n    *   Define a function to calculate the dimension for a given partition using the hook-length formula.\n    *   Iterate through all partitions, check the dimension, and print the qualifying ones as per the problem's request to \"output each number\".\n    *   Output the final total count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_dimension(partition, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of an irreducible representation of S_n\n    corresponding to the given partition using the hook-length formula.\n    \n    Args:\n        partition (list): A list of integers representing a partition of n.\n        n (int): The integer being partitioned.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The dimension of the irreducible representation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # n! is a very large number, but Python's integers handle it automatically.\n    n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n    hook_product = 1\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell (i, j) in the Young diagram of the partition.\n    # i is the 0-indexed row, j is the 0-indexed column.\n    for i in range(len(partition)):\n        for j in range(partition[i]):\n            # Calculate the hook length for the cell (i, j).\n            \n            # 1.
