# The user wants to know the number of positive eigenvalues for the stability operator of a catenoid.
# Let L be the stability operator. The eigenvalue problem is Lu = lambda * u, where u is in L^2.
# The stability operator for a minimal surface like the catenoid has a continuous spectrum on (-inf, 0].
# Positive eigenvalues must be discrete.
# It is a known result in differential geometry that for the catenoid, the stability operator
# does not have any L^2 eigenfunctions with positive eigenvalues.
# The potential term in the operator decays too quickly at infinity to "trap" a particle
# in a positive energy state.

# Therefore, the number of positive eigenvalues is 0.

# The final equation is simply setting the number of positive eigenvalues to 0.
num_positive_eigenvalues = 0

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is: Number of positive eigenvalues = 0.
# The numbers in this equation are 0.
print(f"The number of positive eigenvalues is {num_positive_eigenvalues}.")
