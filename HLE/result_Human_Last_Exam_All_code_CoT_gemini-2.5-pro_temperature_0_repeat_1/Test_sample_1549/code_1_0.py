def solve_n_compactness():
    """
    Calculates the n-compactness value for the space X = [0,1]^3.

    The solution is based on two facts:
    1. The value for the unit interval, [[0,1]], is 2. This is because a sub-basis
       of the form {[0,b)} U {(a,1]} requires at most 2 elements for a cover,
       and the specific cover {[0,1), (0,1]} demonstrates it cannot be 1.
    2. For product spaces, the n-compactness value is the sum of the values
       of its factor spaces. So, [[0,1]^3] = [[0,1]] + [[0,1]] + [[0,1]].
