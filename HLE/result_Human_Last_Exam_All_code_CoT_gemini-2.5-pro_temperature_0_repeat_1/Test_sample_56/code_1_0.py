    explanation = """
    John Rawls' concept of "reciprocity" posits that society should be a fair system of social cooperation. Citizens have a civic duty to uphold the laws and institutions of their society, but this duty is conditional. The condition is that the society's basic structure must be just.

    According to Rawls' principles of justice, particularly the "Difference Principle," social and economic inequalities are only justified if they work to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society.

    If a system perpetuates poverty and does not meet this condition, it is considered unjust. In such an unjust system, the moral grounds for the poorest citizens' obligation to reciprocate (i.e., fulfill their civic duties) are fundamentally weakened. Their obligation is tied to the fairness of the system, and if the system is unfair to them, the bond of civic obligation is not as binding.

    Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that civic obligations are contingent on the fairness of the system, a condition that may not be met for citizens in poverty within an unjust society.
