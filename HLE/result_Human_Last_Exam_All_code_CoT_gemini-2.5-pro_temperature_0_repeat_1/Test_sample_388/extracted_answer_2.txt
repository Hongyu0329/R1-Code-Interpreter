Based on the medications you are picking up and the Excedrin you took for your headache, here are a few important recommendations:

1.  **Interaction with Excedrin:** Your antidepressant, Fluoxetine 20mg, is an SSRI. The Excedrin you took contains aspirin. Taking SSRIs and aspirin (or other NSAIDs like ibuprofen) together can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the stomach. For future headaches, it would be safer to use a product with just acetaminophen (like Tylenol), unless your doctor has specifically told you to take aspirin.

2.  **Headaches and Your Medications:** Headaches can be a side effect of both your birth control (Junel Fe 1.5/30mg) and Fluoxetine. It's important to monitor them.

3.  **Action Plan for Headaches:** Since you are experiencing headaches, it would be a good idea to talk to your doctor. It is especially important to let them know if this is a new type of headache for you, if it's severe, or if you experience any visual changes with it (like seeing flashing lights), as this can be significant with your birth control medication.

In summary, please be cautious about using Excedrin in the future due to the interaction with Fluoxetine, and please follow up with your doctor about these new headaches.
