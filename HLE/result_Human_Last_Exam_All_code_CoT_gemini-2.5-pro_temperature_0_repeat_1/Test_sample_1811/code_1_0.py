# Let χ(M) represent the Euler characteristic of the manifold M.
# The problem asks for the least number of zeros a vector field can have on M.

# According to the Poincaré-Hopf theorem for manifolds with boundary and
# related theorems, this minimum is the absolute value of the Euler
# characteristic of M. The Euler characteristic of the boundary, χ(∂M),
# is not needed for the final answer.

# The formula is therefore |χ(M)|.
# The code below prints this final expression.
# The expression |χ(M)| can be written as an equation: Result = 1 * |χ(M)|.
# As requested by the prompt, we will also output the number in this final equation.
