    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the final formula that provides the upper bound.\n\nMy approach is as follows:\n1.  First, I will clarify the terms in the question. The notation $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is non-standard, and based on the context of covolume $(V)$ and squarefree numbers $(N)$, the most reasonable interpretation is that it refers to the squarefree number $N$ itself, or the discriminant $D$ of the associated quadratic field. The problem is set in the context of Hilbert modular surfaces.\n2.  I will use the well-established formula by Siegel that connects the covolume $V$ of the Hilbert modular group for a real quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ to the value of its Dedekind zeta function $\\zeta_K$ at $s=-1$.\n3.  Next, I will employ the functional equation for Dirichlet L-functions to express the covolume $V$ in terms of the field's discriminant $D$. This will result in the formula: $V = \\frac{D^{3/2}}{12\\pi^2} L(2, \\chi_D)$, where $L(s, \\chi_D)$ is the Dirichlet L-function associated with the field.\n4.  To establish an upper bound for $N$ (and $D$) in terms of $V$, we need a lower bound for the term $L(2, \\chi_D)$. I will use the known analytic bound $L(2, \\chi_D) \\ge \\frac{\\zeta(4)}{\\zeta(2)} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{15}$.\n5.  By substituting this lower bound into the covolume formula, I will derive an inequality relating $V$ and $D$.\n6.  Finally, by rearranging this inequality and using the fact that $N \\le D$, I will obtain the desired upper bound for $N$ in relation to $V$.\n\nThe following Python code will print this derivation and the resulting formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bound_relation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the upper bound for a squarefree natural number N\n    in relation to the covolume V of the corresponding Hilbert modular surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script provides the upper bound for a squarefree natural number (N) in relation to the covolume (V).\")\n    print(\"The non-standard notation (k_{k,∞}) is interpreted as N.\\n\")\n    print(\"Step-by-step Derivation:\")\n    print(\"------------------------\")\n    print(\"1. The covolume (V) of the Hilbert modular group for the real quadratic field K = Q(sqrt(N)) is given by V = 2 * ζ_K(-1), where ζ_K is the Dedekind zeta function of K.\")\n    print(\"\\n2. The covolume V can be expressed in terms of the field's discriminant D using the functional equation for L-functions. The discriminant D is N if N ≡ 1 (mod 4) and 4N otherwise, so N ≤ D.\")\n    print(\"   The exact formula is: V = (D^(3/2) / (12 * π²)) * L(2, χ_D)\")\n    print(\"\\n3. To find an upper bound for D in terms of V, we need a lower bound for the L-function term, L(2, χ_D). A standard result from number theory gives this bound:\")\n    print(\"   L(2, χ_D) ≥ ζ(4) / ζ(2)\")\n    print(\"   where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.

Substituting this lower bound into the covolume formula yields an inequality:\")\n    print(\"   V ≥ (D^(3/2) / (12 * π²)) * (π² / 15)\")\n    print(\"   Simplifying this, we get: V ≥ D^(3/2) / 180\")\n    print(\"\\n5.

Since the squarefree number N is always less than or equal to the discriminant D (N ≤ D), we obtain the final upper bound for N.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(\"----------------\")\n    # The final equation gives the upper bound for N in relation to V.\n    # Each number and variable in the equation is printed explicitly.\n    print(\"N <= (180 * V)^(2/3)\")\n\nsolve_bound_relation()\n```\n<<<N <= (180 * V)^(2/3)>>>"
