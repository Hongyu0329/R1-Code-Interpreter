    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 1,3,5-substituted benzene ring. This substitution pattern, along with the 2,4,6-trimethyl groups, gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This means the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of unique proton environments in one of these arms and on the central core.\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** The central core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring. We will count the signals from the methyl groups on this ring.\n3.  **Count Signals from a Single Arm:** We will analyze one of the identical `[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]` arms. This arm consists of three parts:\n    *   A methylene (-CH2-) linker.\n    *   A pyrazole ring (part of the indazole system).\n    *   A rigid, chiral camphor-derived bicyclic skeleton.\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the unique signals from the central core and one of the arms.\n\nThe following Python code implements this step-by-step analysis to calculate the total number of expected signals.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule by analyzing its structure.\n\n    The molecule is: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n    The analysis proceeds by identifying chemically non-equivalent protons based on the molecule's symmetry and structure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n    # The molecule has a C3 axis of symmetry. This makes the three methyl groups\n    # on the central benzene ring chemically equivalent.\n    # They will produce a single signal.\n    signals_central_methyls = 1\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the methylene (-CH2-) linker.\n    # The -CH2- group connects the central ring to the chiral camphor-pyrazole unit.\n    # Protons on a CH2 group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic,\n    # meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two separate signals.\n    signals_linker_ch2 = 2\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the pyrazole ring proton.\n    # The pyrazole ring within the indazole system has a single proton on one of its carbons.\n    # This proton is in a unique environment and will give one signal.\n    signals_pyrazole_ch = 1\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze the protons on the rigid, chiral camphor-derived skeleton.\n    # This skeleton is asymmetric, so we count each set of non-equivalent protons.\n\n    # Step 4a: Methyl groups on the camphor skeleton.\n    # There are three methyl groups on the camphor skeleton. One is at a bridgehead,\n    # and two are geminal (attached to the same carbon). Due to the chirality and\n    # lack of local symmetry, all three methyl groups are in different chemical\n    # environments and are thus non-equivalent.\n    signals_camphor_methyls = 3\n\n    # Step 4b: Aliphatic C-H and C-H2 protons on the camphor skeleton.\n    # - There is one proton on a bridgehead carbon (-CH-). This is one signal.\n    # - There are two methylene groups (-CH2-). In the rigid bicyclic system,\n    #   the two protons within each CH2 group are diastereotopic (endo/exo), and the\n    #   two CH2 groups are also in different environments. This results in four\n    #   unique proton signals.\n    # Total signals from this part = 1 (from -CH-) + 4 (from two -CH2-) = 5.\n    signals_camphor_aliphatic = 5\n\n    # Step 5: Sum all the signals to find the total number of expected peaks.\n    total_signals = (signals_central_methyls +\n                     signals_linker_ch2 +\n                     signals_pyrazole_ch +\n                     signals_camphor_methyls +\n                     signals_camphor_aliphatic)\n\n    # Print the breakdown of the calculation as requested.\n    print(\"Calculation of expected 1H NMR peaks:\")\n    print(f\"Central core methyls: {signals_central_methyls}\")\n    print(f\"Methylene (-CH2-) linkers: {signals_linker_ch2}\")\n    print(f\"Pyrazole ring C-H: {signals_pyrazole_ch}\")\n    print(f\"Camphor skeleton methyls: {signals_camphor_methyls}\")\n    print(f\"Camphor skeleton aliphatic C-H and C-H2: {signals_camphor_aliphatic}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    # The final equation showing how the total is calculated.\n    print(f\"Total peaks = {signals_central_methyls} + {signals_linker_ch2} + {signals_pyrazole_ch} + {signals_camphor_methyls} + {signals_camphor_aliphatic} = {total_signals}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\ncount_nmr_peaks()\n```\n<<<H>>>"
