  This function returns the IUPAC name of the product from the specified reaction.
  The reaction is an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement of N-(((S)-5-methylcyclopent-1-en-1-yl)methyl)-N-((S)-1-phenylethyl)propionamide.
  
  Step 1: LiHMDS forms the kinetic (E)-enolate of the propionamide.
  Step 2: Heating induces a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
  Workup: Hydrolysis of the intermediate yields a carboxylic acid.
  
  The final product is a substituted propanoic acid.
  - Parent chain: propanoic acid
  - Substituent at C2: (5-methyl-2-methylenecyclopentyl)
  - Stereochemistry:
    - C2 of acid: R configuration
    - C1 of cyclopentyl ring (attachment point): R configuration
    - C5 of cyclopentyl ring (original stereocenter): S configuration (retained)
  
  The numbers in the final name are: 2, 1, 5.
