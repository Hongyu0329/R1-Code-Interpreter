# The puzzle is a logical deduction problem, not a computational one.
# The code will simply print the reasoning and the final answer.

# Step 1: Analyze which colors can be in the plane being built.
# An Orange (O) cube requires a White (W) cube in the z-direction (a different plane).
# This means Orange cubes cannot be placed by rules operating within the x,y plane itself.
# So, the plane must be built using only White (W) and Blue (B) cubes.
colors_in_plane = {"White", "Blue"}

# Step 2: Can we build a plane with just one color (cardinality 1)?
# - A plane of only White cubes? We start with one W. To place another W, we need
#   two adjacent cubes of different colors. We only have one W. So, no.
# - A plane of only Blue cubes? We start with W. We can place a B next to it.
#   To place a second B next to the first B, it needs a W or O neighbor.
#   Its only neighbor is a B. So, no.
# Conclusion: A single-color plane is not possible.

# Step 3: What is the minimum number of colors required?
# Since a 1-color plane is impossible, we must use at least two colors.
# The colors available for the plane are White and Blue.
# Therefore, the smallest possible set of colors is {White, Blue}.

# Step 4: Calculate the cardinality of this set.
cardinality = len(colors_in_plane)

# The final answer is the cardinality of the set of colors used for the plane.
print("The set of colors that can be used to construct the plane is {White, Blue}.")
print("A plane of a single color is not constructible under the given rules.")
print("Therefore, the minimum number of colors required is 2.")
print(f"The cardinality of this set is: {cardinality}")
