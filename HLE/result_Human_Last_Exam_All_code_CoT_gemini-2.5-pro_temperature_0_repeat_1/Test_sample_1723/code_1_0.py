    This function provides the name of the mushroom genus that is famously blue.

    While no known mushroom genus produces a truly blue spore print (a common misconception),
    the genus Lactarius is the correct answer to this riddle. It contains the species
    Lactarius indigo, which is a vibrant blue mushroom that bleeds blue latex.
    This strong association with the color blue makes it the accepted answer.
