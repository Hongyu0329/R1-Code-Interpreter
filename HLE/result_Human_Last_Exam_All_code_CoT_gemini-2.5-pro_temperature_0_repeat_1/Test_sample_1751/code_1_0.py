    1.  The surface area of a lipid in a compressed monolayer is determined by how tightly the individual molecules can pack together. Tighter packing results in a lower surface area per molecule.

    2.  Let's analyze the structures:
        -   {dihydroceramide}: Both of its long hydrocarbon chains (the d18:0 sphingoid base and the 16:0 fatty acid) are fully saturated. Saturated chains are straight and flexible, allowing them to align closely and maximize attractive van der Waals forces. This leads to very tight, dense, and highly ordered packing.

        -   {ceramide}: This lipid contains a trans double bond in its d18:1 sphingoid base. While a trans double bond is less disruptive than a cis double bond, it still introduces a point of rigidity and a slight kink in the hydrocarbon chain. This structural feature hinders the molecules from packing as tightly as their fully saturated counterparts.

    3.  Conclusion: Because the fully saturated chains of {dihydroceramide} can pack more efficiently and closely together, they will occupy less area per molecule. The information provided, stating that dihydroceramide forms 'highly ordered domains', directly supports this conclusion. Highly ordered structures are inherently more compact.

    Therefore, the lipid with the lower surface area when compressed will be:
