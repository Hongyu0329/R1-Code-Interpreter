    "To design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system, we need to find an observer gain matrix `L` such that the state estimation error converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Formulate the Observer Error Dynamics:** The observer's state estimate `x_hat(k)` evolves according to `x_hat(k + 1) = A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))`. The estimation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` dynamics are given by `e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`.\n2.  **Deadbeat Observer Condition:** For the error to vanish in a finite number of steps (deadbeat response), the error dynamics matrix `A - LC` must be nilpotent. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of `A - LC` at the origin (Î»=0).\n3.  **Pole Placement using Duality:** The problem of finding `L` to place the eigenvalues of `A - LC` is a standard pole placement problem. It is equivalent to the problem of finding a state-feedback controller gain `K` for the \"dual\" system. The eigenvalues of `A - LC` are the same as those of its transpose, `(A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T L^T`.\n4.  **Implementation:** We can solve for `K = L^T` for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` using a standard control systems library. The desired observer gain will then be `L = K^T`. We will use the `control.place` function in Python to perform this calculation.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to compute the observer gain matrix `L`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport control as ct\n\ndef solve_observer_gain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices from the problem description\n    A = np.array([\n        [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 0, 2],\n        [0, 1, 0, -1],\n        [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n    ])\n\n    C = np.array([\n        [1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # The dimension of the state vector\n    n = A.shape[0]\n\n    # For a deadbeat observer, all poles must be placed at the origin.\n    desired_poles = np.zeros(n)\n\n    # We solve the pole placement problem for the dual system.\n    # The state matrix of the dual system is A.T (A transpose).\n    # The input matrix of the dual system is C.T (C transpose).\n    # The control.place function finds a gain K such that the eigenvalues of\n    # (A.T - C.T @ K) are placed at the desired locations.\n    try:\n        K = ct.place(A.T, C.T, desired_poles)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred during pole placement: {e}\")\n        print(\"This may happen if the system (A, C) is not observable.\")\n        return\n\n    # The observer gain L is the transpose of the calculated controller gain K.\n    L = K.T\n\n    # Print the final observer gain matrix L\n    print(\"The observer gain matrix L is:\")\n    print(L)\n\n    # Verification (optional): Check if the eigenvalues of (A - LC) are at 0\n    # A_closed_loop = A - L @ C\n    # eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_closed_loop)\n    # print(\"\\nVerification: Eigenvalues of (A - LC):\")\n    # print(np.round(eigenvalues, 5))\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_observer_gain()\n\n```\n<<<[[-2. -1.]\n [ 1.  2.]\n [ 1.  0.]\n [ 1.  1.]]>>>"
