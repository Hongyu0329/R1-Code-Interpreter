# The problem asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder
# of X \ {x}, where X is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.

# Based on established theorems in continuum theory, the Stone-Cech remainder in this case
# is itself a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.

# A fundamental property of any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is that it has
# exactly 'c' composants, where 'c' is the cardinality of the continuum.

# The value of 'c' is given by the equation c = 2^{\aleph_0}.
# Since this number is constant for any valid choice of X and x, the maximum number is also 'c'.
# 'c' is an infinite cardinal number, not a finite integer.
