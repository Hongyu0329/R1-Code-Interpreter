    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English where a tense vowel becomes lax if it is in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable of a word. This often happens when a suffix is added to a root word.\n\nTo solve this, I will analyze each word by comparing it to its root or a related word to see if a tense vowel has become lax due to this rule.\n\n1.  **southern**: Related to *south*. The vowel changes from the tense diphthong /aʊ/ in *south* to the lax vowel /ʌ/ in *southern*. This is a laxing process, although the word is only two syllables.\n2.  **derivative**: Related to *derive*. The vowel changes from the tense diphthong /aɪ/ in *derive* to the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*. This is a classic case of trisyllabic laxing.\n3.  **serenity**: Related to *serene*. The vowel changes from the tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity*. This is another classic case of trisyllabic laxing.\n4.  **pleasant**: Related to *please*. The vowel changes from the tense vowel /iː/ in *please* to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *pleasant*. This is a laxing process, similar to *southern*, but in a two-syllable word.\n5.  **gratitude**: Related to *grateful*. The vowel changes from the tense diphthong /eɪ/ in *grateful* to the lax vowel /æ/ in *gratitude*. This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n6.  **shadow**: This word is related to *shade* (which has a tense vowel /eɪ/). However, *shadow* comes from the Old English word *sceadu*, which already had a short, lax vowel /æ/. Therefore, the vowel in *shadow* was not created by laxing a tense vowel; it was inherited as already lax.\n\nBased on this analysis, *shadow* is the word that has not undergone the process of vowel laxing from a tense state.\n\n```python\ndef find_word_without_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to find the one that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n    Trisyllabic laxing is a process where a tense vowel in a root word becomes lax\n    when a suffix is added, making the vowel fall in the third-to-last syllable.\n    We check each word against a related word with a tense vowel.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_analysis = {\n        \"southern\": \"Underwent laxing (from 'south', /aʊ/ -> /ʌ/)\",\n        \"derivative\": \"Underwent laxing (from 'derive', /aɪ/ -> /ɪ/)\",\n        \"serenity\": \"Underwent laxing (from 'serene', /iː/ -> /ɛ/)\",\n        \"pleasant\": \"Underwent laxing (from 'please', /iː/ -> /ɛ/)\",\n        \"gratitude\": \"Underwent laxing (from 'grateful', /eɪ/ -> /æ/)\",\n        \"shadow\": \"Did NOT undergo laxing.
