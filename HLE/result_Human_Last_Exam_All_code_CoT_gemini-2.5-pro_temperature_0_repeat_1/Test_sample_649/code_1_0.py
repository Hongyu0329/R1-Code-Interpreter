def print_lower_bound_formula():
    """
    This function prints the derived lower bound for the minimax risk R_n^*.

    The problem is symbolic, so we use placeholder values for the numerical
    quantities to demonstrate the structure of the equation as requested.

    The derived lower bound is:
    R_n^* >= (Phi(delta/2) / 2) * (1 - d_TV(P_0^n, (1/N) * sum_{j=1 to N} P_j^n))

    Here's a step-by-step explanation of the derivation:
    1. The minimax risk R_n^* over the whole class P is greater than or equal to the
       minimax risk over the finite subset {P_0, P_1, ..., P_N}.
    2. We reduce the estimation problem to a hypothesis test of H_0: P = P_0 versus
       the composite alternative H_1: P is from {P_1, ..., P_N}. We use a uniform
       prior on the alternatives, leading to the mixture distribution
       P_alt = (1/N) * Sum_{j=1 to N} P_j^n.
    3. For any estimator, we can define a test based on whether the estimate is closer
       to theta_0 or not. The sum of Type I and Type II errors (alpha + beta) for this
       test is related to the maximum risk of the estimator.
    4. The sum of error probabilities is lower bounded by (1 - d_TV(P_0^n, P_alt^n)),
       where d_TV is the total variation distance.
    5. Combining these facts, we arrive at the lower bound.
