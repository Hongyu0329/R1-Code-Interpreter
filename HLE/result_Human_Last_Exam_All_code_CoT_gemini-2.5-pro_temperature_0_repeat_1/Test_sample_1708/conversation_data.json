    "This is a problem from set theory concerning the structure of ordered sets.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Set and Ordering**: The set is `S`, the collection of all finite, non-empty strings formed from the characters `{a, b, c, d}`. The ordering is the standard lexicographical (dictionary) order. For example, `a` < `aa` < `ab` < `b`.\n2.  **Understand Order Type**: The order type of a well-ordered set is the unique ordinal number that is order-isomorphic to it. This means we are looking for a specific ordinal `α` such that there's a one-to-one, order-preserving map between our set `S` and the set of all ordinals less than `α`.\n3.  **State the Result**: This is a well-established result in set theory and theoretical computer science. The order type of the set of finite strings over a finite alphabet (with at least two characters) under lexicographical order is the ordinal `ω^ω`.\n4.  **Explain the Answer**: The ordinal `ω^ω` (omega to the power of omega) is a countable limit ordinal. It is the least upper bound (supremum) of the infinite sequence of ordinals: `ω`, `ω^2`, `ω^3`, `ω^4`, and so on.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: Since the answer is a symbolic ordinal, there is no numerical computation to perform. I will write a Python script that prints a clear explanation of the concepts and states the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_order_type():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and provides the solution for the order type of the set of\n    finite strings on {a,b,c,d} ordered lexically.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Task Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"The problem is to find the order type of the set of all finite, non-empty strings\")\n    print(\"that can be formed from the characters {a, b, c, d}, with the standard\")\n    print(\"lexicographical (dictionary) ordering.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Key Concepts ---\")\n    print(\"1.
