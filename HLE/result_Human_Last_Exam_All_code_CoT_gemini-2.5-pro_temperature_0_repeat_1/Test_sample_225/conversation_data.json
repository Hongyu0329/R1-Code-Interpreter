    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve Type:** The curve is a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A*sin(a*t + δ)` and `y(t) = B*sin(b*t)`. In our case, `x(t) = cos(9t)` is equivalent to `sin(9t + π/2)`, so we have `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n2.  **Check for Coprime Parameters:** The formula for self-intersections applies when the frequency parameters `a` and `b` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). Let's check for `a=9` and `b=5`:\n    *   The divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9.\n    *   The divisors of 5 are 1, 5.\n    *   The greatest common divisor, `gcd(9, 5)`, is 1. So, the parameters are coprime.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** For a Lissajous curve with coprime integer parameters `a` and `b`, the number of self-intersection points `N` is given by the formula:\n    `N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** We substitute `a = 9` and `b = 5` into the formula to find the number of self-intersections.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The parameters from the curve equations x=cos(at), y=sin(bt)\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections of a Lissajous curve\n    # with coprime parameters a and b is N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2.\n\n    # Intermediate calculation steps\n    a_minus_1 = a - 1\n    b_minus_1 = b - 1\n    numerator = a_minus_1 * b_minus_1\n    num_intersections = numerator // 2\n\n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"The curve is a Lissajous curve with parameters a = 9 and b = 5.\")\n    print(\"The number of self-intersections (N) is given by the formula: N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n    print(f\"N = ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = {a_minus_1} * {b_minus_1} / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = {numerator} / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = {num_intersections}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of self-intersection points is {num_intersections}.\")\n\nsolve_lissajous_intersections()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
