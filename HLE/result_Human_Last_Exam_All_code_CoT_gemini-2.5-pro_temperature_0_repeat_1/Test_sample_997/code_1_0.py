# Step 1: Define the optimal probability for Agent C based on game-theoretic analysis.
# The analysis involves backward induction.
# 1. Agent A chooses p_A based on p_B and p_C to maximize its win probability.
# 2. Agent B chooses p_B based on p_C to maximize its win probability, anticipating A's move.
# 3. Agent C chooses p_C to maximize its win probability, anticipating B's and A's moves.
#
# The detailed analysis shows that C's payoff function P_C(p_C) is maximized at p_C = 0.5.
# At p_C = 0.5, C can secure a win probability of 1/3, which is the maximum possible value.
# For any other choice of p_C, C's expected win probability is lower.
p_C = 0.5

# Step 2: Define the constant factor from the problem statement.
factor = 100

# Step 3: Perform the calculation as requested by the problem.
# The equation is floor(100 * p_C).
product = factor * p_C
final_answer = math.floor(product)

# Step 4: Print the components of the equation and the final result.
