# Step 1: Solve for (A) - The Sherlock Holmes story.
# The couplet alludes to "The Adventure of the Priory School," where misleading tracks
# were made by a horse shod with fake cow-hoof shoes.
# Thus, the shoes belonged to a horse.
a = 7

# Step 2: Solve for (C) - Nabokov's prior work.
# The question asks about the work where Nabokov most pervasively experienced
# "intricate back-referencing." This most accurately describes his massive,
# decade-long project of translating and writing a detailed commentary for
# Alexander Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin." The structure of "Pale Fire" (a poem
# followed by a scholarly commentary) directly parodies this type of work.
c = 7

# Step 3: Use the mathematical constraint to find (B).
# The problem states that the sum of the three numbers is a multiple of 8.
# We have a + b + c = multiple of 8.
# 7 + b + 7 = multiple of 8
# 14 + b = multiple of 8
# The next multiple of 8 after 14 is 16. So, 14 + b = 16, which means b = 2.
b = 2

# Step 4: Verify the choice for (B).
# Option (B)-2 is "freedom, as often symbolized by the lepidoptera."
# The Holmes allusion is to a trick used for concealment and escape. The theme of
# escape into a fantasy of freedom is central to "Pale Fire" and is symbolized
# by butterflies. The connection is logical.

# Step 5: Output the final answer and the equation as requested.
final_sum = a + b + c
print(f"The three numbers are: {a} {b} {c}")
print(f"The final equation is: {a} + {b} + {c} = {final_sum}")
print(f"The sum, {final_sum}, is a multiple of 8.")
