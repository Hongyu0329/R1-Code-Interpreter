    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to account for several types of controls required for accurate data acquisition and analysis. Here is a breakdown of the necessary controls and the calculation.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. We need one sample of streptavidin beads with no fluorophores to measure autofluorescence and set initial voltage and gate positions.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** For a multi-color experiment, you must correct for the spectral overlap between fluorophores. You need one control for each fluorophore in your panel. Since you have five fluorophores (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These are crucial for setting accurate positive gates, especially in a complex panel. An FMO control includes all fluorophores except for the one being measured. This reveals the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the channel of interest. For a 5-color panel, you would ideally prepare 5 FMO controls, one for each channel.\n\nThe Python script below will calculate the total number of essential controls based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a \n    flow cytometry experiment with five channels.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of fluorophores/channels in the experiment\n    num_fluorophores = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    \n    # 1. Unstained Control: To measure autofluorescence of the beads.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    \n    # 2. Single-Stain Controls: For compensation of spectral overlap.\n    # One is needed for each fluorophore.\n    single_stain_controls = num_fluorophores\n    \n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: For accurate gating.\n    # One is needed for each channel to assess spread.\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorophores\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n    \n    print(\"To ensure a high-quality flow cytometry sorting experiment with 5 channels, you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    print(f\"1.
