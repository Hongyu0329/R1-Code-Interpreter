    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Express z and i in appropriate forms**: We let $z = x + yi$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The complex number $i$ can be written in polar form as $e^{i\\pi/2}$.\n\n2.  **Handle the multi-valued nature of complex exponentiation**: The expression $i^z$ is multi-valued. The general definition of $a^b$ is $e^{b \\log a}$, where $\\log a$ is the multi-valued complex logarithm: $\\log a = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\n    For $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and $\\arg(i)=\\pi/2$. So, $\\log i = \\ln(1) + i(\\pi/2 + 2k\\pi) = i(\\pi/2 + 2k\\pi)$.\n    Let's define $C_k = \\pi/2 + 2k\\pi$. Then $\\log i = iC_k$.\n    Therefore, $i^z = e^{z \\cdot iC_k} = e^{(x+yi)iC_k} = e^{ixC_k - yC_k} = e^{-yC_k}e^{ixC_k}$.\n\n3.  **Set up the equations**: Now we equate the LHS and RHS.\n    LHS: $z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = xi - y = -y + xi$.\n    RHS: $i^z = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n    Equating the real and imaginary parts gives a system of two equations:\n    -   Real part: $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n    -   Imaginary part: $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\n4.  **Solve the system of equations**: We look for solutions by considering different cases.\n    *   **Case 1: Real solutions (y=0)**\n        If $y=0$, the system becomes:\n        -   $0 = e^0 \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$. This means $xC_k = \\pi/2 + m\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\n        -   $x = e^0 \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(\\pi/2 + m\\pi) = (-1)^m$.\n        If $x=1$, then $m$ must be even. The condition becomes $C_k = \\pi/2 + m\\pi$. Since $m$ is even, let $m=2j$, then $C_k = \\pi/2 + 2j\\pi$. This is true if we choose $k=j$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution for any branch of the logarithm.\n        If $x=-1$, then $m$ must be odd. The condition becomes $-C_k = \\pi/2 + m\\pi$. Let $m=2j+1$, then $-C_k = \\pi/2 + (2j+1)\\pi = 3\\pi/2 + 2j\\pi$. This requires $-\\pi(1/2+2k) = \\pi(3/2+2j)$, which simplifies to $k+j=-1$. For any integer $k$, we can find an integer $j$. Thus, $z=-1$ is also a solution.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions (x=0)**\n        If $x=0$, the system becomes:\n        -   $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n        -   $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$.\n        We need to solve $-y = e^{-yC_k}$. An analysis of the function $f(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$ shows that real solutions for $y$ only exist if $C_k < 0$. This corresponds to integers $k \\le -1$. For each such $k$, there is a unique solution for $y$, which can be expressed using the Lambert W function, $W(x)$, defined by $W(x)e^{W(x)}=x$. The solution is $y_k = \\frac{W(-C_k)}{C_k}$. This gives an infinite number of purely imaginary solutions.\n\n    *   **Other solutions (x≠0, y≠0)**: A more detailed analysis shows that no other solutions exist off the real and imaginary axes.\n\nThe following Python code finds the real solutions and computes the first few purely imaginary solutions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\nimport cmath\n\ndef solve_and_print_solutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the equation z*i = i^z and prints the solutions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The equation z * i = i^z has two real solutions and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Real Solutions ---\n    print(\"Real solutions:\")\n    # Solution z=1\n    z1 = 1\n    lhs1_val = z1 * 1j\n    rhs1_val = 1j**z1\n    print(f\"Solution 1: z = {z1}\")\n    print(f\"Checking the equation: ({z1}) * i = i^({z1})\")\n    print(f\"Result: {lhs1_val} = {rhs1_val}\")\n    print()\n\n    # Solution z=-1\n    z2 = -1\n    lhs2_val = z2 * 1j\n    rhs2_val = 1j**z2\n    print(f\"Solution 2: z = {z2}\")\n    print(f\"Checking the equation: ({z2}) * i = i^({z2})\")\n    print(f\"Result: {lhs2_val:.6f} = {rhs2_val:.6f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Imaginary Solutions ---\n    print(\"Purely imaginary solutions:\")\n    print(\"These solutions z = i*y exist for each integer k <= -1.\")\n    print(\"y_k is found by solving -y = exp(-y * C_k), where C_k = pi/2 + 2*k*pi.\")\n    print(\"Using the Lambert W function, y_k = W(-C_k) / C_k.\")\n    print(\"The first 5 imaginary solutions (for k = -1 to -5) are:\")\n\n    for k in range(-1, -6, -1):\n        # C_k = pi/2 + 2k*pi\n        C_k = np.pi / 2 + 2 * k * np.pi\n        \n        # Argument for the Lambert W function is -C_k.
