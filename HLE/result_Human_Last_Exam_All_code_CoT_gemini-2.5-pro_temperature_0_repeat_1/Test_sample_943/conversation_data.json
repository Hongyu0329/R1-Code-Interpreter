    "To find the value of $K$, we need to determine the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank of the given tensor and equate it to the provided expression.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Tensor:** The tensor is defined by the function $T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. We will analyze its structure to determine its slice rank.\n2.  **Lower Bound on Slice Rank:** We will establish a lower bound on the slice rank. A standard method is to show that the slice rank is at least the dimension of the vector space spanned by the \"slices\" of the tensor. We will compute the dimension of the space of functions $\\{x \\mapsto T_n(x, y, z)\\}$ for all choices of $y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n3.  **Upper Bound on Slice Rank:** We will find an upper bound on the slice rank using the subadditivity property, $\\text{SR}(A+B) \\le \\text{SR}(A) + \\text{SR}(B)$. We will decompose $T_n$ into two simpler tensors and bound their slice ranks.\n4.  **Determine Asymptotic Behavior:** By combining the lower and upper bounds, we will find that the slice rank $\\text{SR}(T_n)$ is tightly constrained. This will allow us to determine the asymptotic growth rate $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\text{SR}(T_n))^{1/n}$.\n5.  **Solve for K:** We are given that the slice rank is of the form $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. By equating our calculated asymptotic growth rate with the base of this expression, $3/2^K$, we can form an equation and solve for $K$.\n\n### Execution:\n\n1.  **Lower Bound:** The slice rank with respect to the first variable, $\\text{SR}_1(T_n)$, is the dimension of the space of functions $V = \\text{span}\\{x \\mapsto T_n(x, y, z) \\mid y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n\\}$. Let $c_i = y_i + z_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The space $V$ is spanned by the functions $g_c(x) - 1$, where $g_c(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + c_i)$ for $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}^n$. We can show that the set of functions $\\{g_c(x)\\}$ spans the entire $2^n$-dimensional space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This is done by representing these functions in the monomial basis $\\{\\prod_{i \\in S} x_i\\}_{S \\subseteq [n]}$ and proving that the corresponding $3^n \\times 2^n$ matrix has rank $2^n$. Since this space of functions contains the constant function $1$, the dimension of $V$ is also $2^n$. Thus, $\\text{SR}(T_n) \\ge \\text{SR}_1(T_n) = 2^n$.\n\n2.  **Upper Bound:** We can write $T_n = P_n - \\mathbf{1}_n$, where $P_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ and $\\mathbf{1}_n$ is the tensor that is constant 1 everywhere.\n    *   The slice rank is subadditive: $\\text{SR}(T_n) \\le \\text{SR}(P_n) + \\text{SR}(\\mathbf{1}_n)$.\n    *   The tensor $\\mathbf{1}_n$ is a rank-1 tensor, so its slice rank is 1.\n    *   The tensor $P_n$ is the $n$-th tensor power of $P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$. The slice rank of a tensor product is the product of the slice ranks, so $\\text{SR}(P_n) = (\\text{SR}(P_1))^n$.\n    *   By examining the $2 \\times 2$ matrix slices of the $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor $P_1$, we find its slice rank is 2.\n    *   Therefore, $\\text{SR}(P_n) = 2^n$.\n    *   This gives the upper bound: $\\text{SR}(T_n) \\le 2^n + 1$.\n\n3.  **Asymptotics and Solving for K:**\n    *   We have established that $2^n \\le \\text{SR}(T_n) \\le 2^n + 1$.\n    *   The asymptotic behavior is $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\text{SR}(T_n))^{1/n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (2^n)^{1/n} = 2$.\n    *   The problem states the slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The base of this asymptotic expression is $3/2^K$.\n    *   Equating the two, we get the equation: $3/2^K = 2$.\n    *   Solving for $K$:\n        $3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K$\n        $3 = 2^{K+1}$\n        $\\log_2(3) = K+1$\n        $K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical value of $K$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_for_k():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the value of K based on the derived equation.\n    The slice rank of the tensor T_n was shown to be asymptotically 2^n.\n    The problem provides the slice rank as (3 / 2^K)^n * e^(o(n)).\n    By equating the asymptotic bases, we get the equation: 3 / (2^K) = 2.\n    This script solves this equation for K.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The numbers in the final equation\n    val_3 = 3\n    val_2a = 2\n    val_2b = 2\n\n    print(\"The equation to solve for K is derived by equating the asymptotic growth rates:\")\n    print(f\"{val_3} / ({val_2a}^K) = {val_2b}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSolving the equation step-by-step:\")\n    print(f\"1.
