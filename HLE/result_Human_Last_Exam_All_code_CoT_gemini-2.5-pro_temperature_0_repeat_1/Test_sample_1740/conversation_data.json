    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Fetch Data**: I will write a Python script to download the latest microRNA data from miRBase, which is the authoritative database for miRNA sequences and annotations.\n2.  **Filter for Human miRNAs**: The script will parse the downloaded file and specifically look for entries corresponding to *Homo sapiens* (human).\n3.  **Identify let-7 Family Members**: Within the human entries, the script will identify all unique members of the let-7 family. This family is characterized by names starting with \"let-7\" (e.g., let-7a, let-7b) and also includes \"miR-98,\" which is known to be a member based on sequence and function. Different precursor genes (like `hsa-let-7a-1` and `hsa-let-7a-2`) are considered to produce the same mature miRNA family member (let-7a), so the script will count these unique members only once.\n4.  **Count and Display**: Finally, the script will count the total number of unique members found and print each member's name before displaying the final count.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef find_human_let7_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from miRBase and counts the number of human let-7 family members.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
