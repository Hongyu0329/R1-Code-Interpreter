    print("A nontrivial sequence is one that is not eventually constant.")
    print("The condition implies that the only convergent sequences are the eventually constant ones.")
    print("For a group topology on the integers (Z, +), this forces the topology to be the discrete topology.")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print(" - Any non-discrete group topology on Z allows for the construction of a nontrivial convergent sequence.")
    print("   - If the topology is first-countable (e.g., p-adic topologies), we can construct a sequence of distinct points converging to 0 from the nested neighborhood basis.")
    print("   - The only other possibility for a group topology on Z is the cofinite topology, which is not first-countable. In this topology, the sequence x_n = n can be shown to converge, and it is nontrivial.")
    print("Therefore, the only group topology on Z with no nontrivial convergent sequences is the discrete topology.")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyze the condition 'totally bounded'.")
    print("A topological group G is totally bounded if for every open neighborhood U of the identity (0 for Z), G can be covered by a finite number of translates of U.")
    print("That is, there exists a finite set F = {g_1, ..., g_n} such that F + U = G.")

    print("\nStep 3: Check if the discrete topology on Z is totally bounded.")
    print("In the discrete topology, any subset of Z is open. Let's choose the open neighborhood U = {0}.")
    print("For the topology to be totally bounded, we need to find a finite set F such that F + U = Z.")
    print("With U = {0}, this equation becomes F + {0} = Z, which simplifies to F = Z.")
    print("This requires the finite set F to be equal to the set of all integers Z, which is infinite.")
    print("This is a contradiction. Therefore, the discrete topology on Z is not totally bounded.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion.")
    print("The first condition ('no nontrivial convergent sequences') implies the topology must be discrete.")
    print("The second condition ('totally bounded') cannot be satisfied by the discrete topology on an infinite group like Z.")
    print("Since there is no topology that can satisfy both conditions simultaneously, the number of such topologies is 0.")
