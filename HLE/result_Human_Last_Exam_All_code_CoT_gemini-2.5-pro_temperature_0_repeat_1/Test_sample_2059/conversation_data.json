    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Polynomial and the Target Sum:**\n    Let the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$.\n    We want to find the sum of the squares of the coefficients, $S = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n2.  **Use Properties of Polynomials:**\n    The sum $\\sum_k a_k^2$ is the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$. Let's call this product $R(x)$.\n\n3.  **Establish a Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let $P_n(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$. We are interested in $P_{20}(x)$.\n    We can write a recurrence for $P_n(x)$:\n    $P_n(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3) \\cdot P_{n-1}(x^3)$.\n    Let $R_n(x) = P_n(x)P_n(x^{-1})$. The value we seek, $S$, is the constant term of $R_{20}(x)$, which we'll call $C_{20}$.\n    $R_n(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x^{-1}+x^{-2}+x^{-3}) \\cdot R_{n-1}(x^3)$.\n    Let's expand the first part: $(1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x^{-1}+x^{-2}+x^{-3}) = 4 + 3(x+x^{-1}) + 2(x^2+x^{-2}) + (x^3+x^{-3})$.\n    Let $C_n$ be the constant term of $R_n(x)$ and $c_{k,n}$ be the coefficient of $x^k$ in $R_n(x)$.\n    By examining the product, we can find a recurrence relation for the coefficients. Since $R_{n-1}(x^3)$ only contains powers of $x$ that are multiples of 3, we can relate the coefficients of $R_n(x)$ to those of $R_{n-1}(x)$.\n    This leads to a system of linear recurrence relations for $C_n$ and the coefficient of $x^1$, which we denote as $c_n$:\n    $C_n = 4 C_{n-1} + 2 c_{n-1}$\n    $c_n = 3 C_{n-1} + 2 c_{n-1}$\n    with initial conditions for $n=1$ (the case with only the $i=0$ term):\n    $R_1(x) = 4 + 3(x+x^{-1}) + 2(x^2+x^{-2}) + (x^3+x^{-3})$.\n    So, $C_1 = 4$ and $c_1 = 3$.\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence using Matrix Diagonalization:**\n    We can write the system in matrix form: $\\begin{pmatrix} C_n \\\\ c_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} C_{n-1} \\\\ c_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Let $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. We need to compute $M^{19} \\begin{pmatrix} C_1 \\\\ c_1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues of $M$ are $\\lambda = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n    By diagonalizing the matrix or using an equivalent method, we can find a closed-form expression for $C_n$.\n    Let $(3+\\sqrt{7})^k = A_k + B_k\\sqrt{7}$ for integers $A_k, B_k$.\n    The solution for $C_n$ can be expressed in terms of $A_{n-1}$ and $B_{n-1}$:\n    $C_n = 4 A_{n-1} + 10 B_{n-1}$.\n    We need to find $C_{20}$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Necessary Terms:**\n    We need $A_{19}$ and $B_{19}$. We can find these by using the recurrence relations for $A_k$ and $B_k$:\n    $A_{k+1} + B_{k+1}\\sqrt{7} = (A_k + B_k\\sqrt{7})(3+\\sqrt{7}) = (3A_k + 7B_k) + (A_k + 3B_k)\\sqrt{7}$.\n    So, $A_{k+1} = 3A_k + 7B_k$ and $B_{k+1} = A_k + 3B_k$.\n    Starting with $A_1=3, B_1=1$, we can iterate 18 times to find $A_{19}$ and $B_{19}$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Once $A_{19}$ and $B_{19}$ are found, the final answer is $C_{20} = 4 A_{19} + 10 B_{19}$. The following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the given polynomial expansion.\n    The problem reduces to solving a linear recurrence relation C_n = 4*C_{n-1} + 2*c_{n-1}\n    and c_n = 3*C_{n-1} + 2*c_{n-1}, where C_n is the sum of squares for a product of n terms.\n    The solution can be expressed as C_n = 4*A_{n-1} + 10*B_{n-1}, where (3+sqrt(7))^(n-1) = A_{n-1} + B_{n-1}*sqrt(7).\n    We need to find C_20, which requires computing A_19 and B_19.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let (3+sqrt(7))^n = A_n + B_n * sqrt(7).\n    # We start with n=1.\n    # A_1 = 3, B_1 = 1.\n    A = 3\n    B = 1\n\n    # We need A_19 and B_19.
