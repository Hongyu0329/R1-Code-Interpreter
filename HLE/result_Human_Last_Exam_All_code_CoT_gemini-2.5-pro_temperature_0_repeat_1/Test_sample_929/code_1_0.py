    print("\nStep 1: Define the relationship between behavior and pollination.")
    print("Plant fitness in this context depends on successful pollination.")
    print("Pollination requires physical contact between the insect and the flower.")
    print("Let's evaluate the behaviors based on contact:")
    print("- Investigation (starts with 1, ends with 2): Non-contact. Does not cause pollination.")
    print("- Interaction (starts with 3, ends with 4): Physical contact. This is required for pollination.")
    print("- Feeding (starts with 5, ends with 6): A specific type of interaction. This is the most effective behavior for pollination as the insect actively probes the flower.")

    print("\nStep 2: Evaluate each answer choice.")

    print("\nChoice A: 4-3 >> 6-5 (Duration of interaction is much greater than duration of feeding)")
    print("   - Meaning: The insect spends a lot of time touching the plant but not actively feeding.")
    print("   - Effect: Less effective. Pollination is most likely during feeding.")

    print("\nChoice B: 6-5 >> 4-3 (Duration of feeding is much greater than duration of interaction)")
    print("   - Meaning: The time spent feeding is greater than the total time spent touching the plant.")
    print("   - Effect: Logically impossible. Feeding is a type of interaction, so its duration cannot be longer.")

    print("\nChoice C: 4-3 >> 2-1 (Duration of interaction is much greater than duration of investigation)")
    print("   - Meaning: The insect spends a long time on the plant per visit.")
    print("   - Effect: This is a good behavior, but a few long visits might be less effective for cross-pollination across a population than many shorter visits.")

    print("\nChoice D: n(5)/hour >> n(3)/hour (Frequency of feeding is much greater than frequency of interactions)")
    print("   - Meaning: The insect starts feeding more times than it starts interacting with the plant.")
    print("   - Effect: Logically impossible. A feeding event (5) can only happen after an interaction starts (3). Therefore, the number of feeding events cannot exceed the number of interaction events.")

    print("\nChoice E: n(1)/hour >> n(3)/hour (Frequency of investigation is much greater than frequency of interactions)")
    print("   - Meaning: The insect approaches the plant many times but rarely lands or makes contact.")
    print("   - Effect: This describes an inefficient or hesitant visitor. Bad for pollination.")

    print("\nChoice F: n(3)/hour >> n(1)/hour (Frequency of interactions is much greater than frequency of investigations)")
    print("   - Meaning: The insect almost always makes contact (interacts) whenever it approaches (investigates).")
    print("   - Effect: This describes a highly efficient pollinator. This high frequency of contact maximizes the number of pollination events over time, which is ideal for plant fitness.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("A high frequency of interactions (Choice F) is more beneficial than a long duration of a single interaction (Choice C).")
    print("An efficient visitor that makes contact on nearly every approach will lead to more pollination events across more flowers and plants.")
    print("This pattern has the greatest positive effect on plant fitness.")
