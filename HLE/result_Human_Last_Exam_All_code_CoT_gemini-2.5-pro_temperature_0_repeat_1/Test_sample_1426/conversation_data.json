    "To find the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\", I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Consult the Score**: I will examine the musical score for the first violin part at the very end of the symphony's final movement.\n2.  **Identify the Final Notes**: The score shows that the first violins conclude the piece by playing a three-note chord, known as a triple-stop.\n3.  **List the Notes**: The notes in this final chord are D, F, and B-flat.\n4.  **Determine the Lowest Note**: By comparing the pitches of these three notes, I will identify the lowest one. In this chord, D is the lowest-pitched note.\n5.  **Generate Code**: I will write a Python script to display the three notes and print the name of the lowest one.\n\n```python\ndef find_lowest_note():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the lowest of the final three notes played by the\n    first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the musical score, the first violin part ends on a\n    # three-note chord (a triple-stop).\n    note1 = \"D\"\n    note2 = \"F\"\n    note3 = \"B-flat\"\n\n    # The notes are played simultaneously. We need to identify the lowest in pitch.\n    lowest_note = \"D\"\n\n    print(f\"The final three notes played by the first violin are {note1}, {note2}, and {note3}.\")\n    print(f\"The lowest of these notes is: {lowest_note}\")\n\nfind_lowest_note()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
