    "My plan is to determine the transformation rule by examining the relationship between the input and output grids. I'll assume that the value of each cell in the output grid is determined by the value of the corresponding cell in the input grid and the sum of its eight neighbors. This is a common pattern in grid transformation puzzles, similar to Conway's Game of Life.\n\n1.  **Define States**: Let `C` be the value of a cell in the input grid (0 for dead, 1 for live). Let `N` be the sum of the values of its eight neighbors. The output value `O` is a function of `C` and `N`.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Rule**: I will analyze all five examples to find a consistent rule. By checking each cell, I can map the `(C, N)` pair to its corresponding output `O`.\n    *   For a dead cell (`C=0`), I'll find which values of `N` cause it to become alive (`O=1`). This is the \"Birth\" condition.\n    *   For a live cell (`C=1`), I'll find which values of `N` cause it to stay alive (`O=1`). This is the \"Survival\" condition.\n\n3.  **Identify the Pattern**: After analyzing the examples, the rule appears to be:\n    *   **Birth**: A dead cell (`C=0`) becomes live (`O=1`) if it has exactly 2, 3, 5, or 6 live neighbors.\n    *   **Survival**: A live cell (`C=1`) stays live (`O=1`) if it has exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors.\n    *   **Death**: In all other cases, the cell becomes or stays dead (`O=0`).\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule**: I will write a Python script that implements this rule. The script will take the sixth input grid, iterate through each cell, calculate the neighbor sum `N`, and determine the output value based on the rule above.\n\n5.  **Generate Output**: The script will then print the resulting 5x5 grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_grid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the grid transformation puzzle by applying a discovered rule.\n    The rule is a variant of Conway's Game of Life: B2356/S23.\n    - A dead cell (0) becomes live (1) if it has 2, 3, 5, or 6 live neighbors.\n    - A live cell (1) survives (stays 1) if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors.\n    - Otherwise, a cell is dead (0) in the next state.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array([\n        [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n    ])\n\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Define the 3x3 neighborhood boundaries, handling edges\n            r_start, r_end = max(0, r - 1), min(rows, r + 2)\n            c_start, c_end = max(0, c - 1), min(cols, c + 2)\n            \n            # Sum the neighbors\n            neighbor_sum = np.sum(input_grid[r_start:r_end, c_start:c_end])\n            \n            # The sum includes the cell itself, so subtract it\n            center_val = input_grid[r, c]\n            neighbor_sum -= center_val\n\n            # Apply the B2356/S23 rule\n            if center_val == 0:  # Dead cell (Birth rule)\n                if neighbor_sum in [2, 3, 5, 6]:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1\n            else:  # Live cell (Survival rule)\n                if neighbor_sum in [2, 3]:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1\n    \n    # Print the final grid as requested\n    for row in output_grid:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n\nsolve_grid()\n```\n<<<1111011001101011011101111>>>"
