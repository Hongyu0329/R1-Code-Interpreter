The reaction between 1,3-butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder reaction.

1.  **Reactants**:
    - Diene: 1,3-butadiene (a 4-pi electron system)
    - Dienophile: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a 2-pi electron system)

2.  **Reaction Type**:
    This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, a concerted pericyclic reaction that forms a six-membered ring.

3.  **Product Formation**:
    A new six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative) is formed. The substituents from the dienophile (Cl, Cl, F, F) are attached to the newly formed single-bonded carbons of the ring.
