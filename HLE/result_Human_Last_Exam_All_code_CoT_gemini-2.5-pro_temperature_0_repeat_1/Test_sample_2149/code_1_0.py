# Step 1: Decipher Y1 from Clue 1.
# The clue about "byproduct fouling his salt wells" and "illuminated the path" points to the
# first commercial oil well drilled by Edwin Drake in 1859, which launched the petroleum industry.
Y1 = 1859

# Step 2: Identify reactants from Clue 3 and their properties.
# The original Heck reaction involves an aryl halide and an alkene.
# A classic example is Iodobenzene (C6H5I) and Styrene (C8H8).
# Molar Mass of Styrene (C8H8): (8 * 12.01) + (8 * 1.01) = 96.08 + 8.08 = 104.16 g/mol.
# Molar Mass of Iodobenzene (C6H5I): (6 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + 126.90 = 72.06 + 5.05 + 126.90 = 204.01 g/mol.
M_styrene = 104.16
M_iodobenzene = 204.01

# Step 3: Establish the relationship and calculate Y4.
# The puzzle implies a relationship: Y4 / Y1 = M_styrene / M_iodobenzene.
# Y4 = Y1 * (M_styrene / M_iodobenzene)
# Y4 = 1859 * (104.16 / 204.01) = 1859 * 0.51056... â‰ˆ 949.14
# We'll take the integer part, so Y4 = 949.
Y4 = 949

# Step 4: Determine Y2 and Y3 (for completeness, though not in the final equation).
# The digits from the reactants' formulas (C6H5I, C8H8) are {6, 5, 1, 8, 8}.
# The variable structures are Y3 = X3X4X8X6 and Y2 = X5X6X2X7X6.
# From Y1=1859, we know X1=1, X2=8, X3=5, X4=9.
# So, Y3 = 59X8X6 and Y2 = X5X68X7X6.
# Using the digits from the formulas, we can set X6=6 and X8=8.
# This gives Y3 = 5986.
# For Y2, with X6=6, we have Y2 = X568X76. Using remaining digits {1, 5}, we set X5=1, X7=5.
# This gives Y2 = 16856.
Y2 = 16856
Y3 = 5986

# Step 5: Print the final equation showing the relationship.
# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
print(f"{Y4} / {Y1} = {M_styrene} / {M_iodobenzene}")

# Restore the original stdout
sys.stdout = original_stdout
# Get the captured output
output = captured_output.getvalue()
# Print the captured output to the actual console
print(output)

# Step 6: Calculate the final numerical answer.
final_answer = M_styrene / M_iodobenzene
# The final answer is the value of this "topological state index".
# print(f"<<<{final_answer:.2f}>>>")
