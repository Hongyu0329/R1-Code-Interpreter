# The user wants to find the value of foo(7).
# The code in the prompt counts the number of multiplication tables on n elements
# that satisfy the axioms of a "right group".
# A right group is a structure isomorphic to the direct product of a group G
# and a right-zero semigroup R_k, where |G| * k = n.

# For n=7 (a prime number), there are two cases for the structure G x R_k:
# 1. |G|=7, k=1: The structure is the cyclic group C_7.
# 2. |G|=1, k=7: The structure is the right-zero semigroup R_7.

# We calculate the number of distinct multiplication tables for each case and add them.
n = 7

# Case 1: The structure is a group of order 7 (isomorphic to C_7).
# The number of tables is g(7) = n! / |Aut(C_n)|.
# For a prime n, |Aut(C_n)| = phi(n) = n - 1.
n_factorial = math.factorial(n)
phi_n = n - 1
num_group_tables = n_factorial // phi_n

# Case 2: The structure is a right-zero semigroup of order 7 (isomorphic to R_7).
# The number of tables is n! / |Aut(R_n)|.
# |Aut(R_n)| = |Aut(C_1 x R_n)| = |Aut(C_1)| * n! = 1 * n! = n!
# So, the number of tables is n! / n! = 1.
num_right_zero_tables = 1

# The total number is the sum of the two cases.
total_count = num_group_tables + num_right_zero_tables

# Print the final equation and its components as requested.
