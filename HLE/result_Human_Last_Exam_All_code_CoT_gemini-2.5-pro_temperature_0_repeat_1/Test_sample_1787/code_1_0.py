def solve_transit_brightness_drop():
    """
    Calculates the brightness drop of a brown dwarf during a planetary transit.
    
    This function follows these steps:
    1.  Defines the ratios from the problem's geometric constraints.
    2.  Establishes the relationship between the ratio of planetary radii to the star's radius (y)
        and the ratio of their orbital distances (x), derived as y = (1-x)/(4x).
    3.  Uses an assumed, plausible physical constraint for the ratio of orbital distances, x = r1/r2 = 5/8,
        as the problem is otherwise under-determined.
    4.  Calculates the value of y = R2/RBD.
    5.  Calculates the ratio of the areas, (R2/RBD)^2, which corresponds to the fractional brightness drop.
    6.  Computes the final brightness drop in bolometric magnitudes using Pogson's law.
    7.  Prints the steps and the final result.
