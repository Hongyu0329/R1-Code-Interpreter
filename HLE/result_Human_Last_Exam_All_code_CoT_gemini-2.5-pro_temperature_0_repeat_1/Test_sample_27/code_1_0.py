    # (3) True dual-functional TCRs: Highly significant biological cause. Inefficient TCR-alpha allelic exclusion is a well-known feature, affecting up to 30% of T cells.
    # (4) One transcript not on surface: Plausible, given the continuous nature of TCR-alpha rearrangement.
    # (5) One transcript is autoreactive: Not a significant cause. Clonal deletion, not receptor editing, is the primary fate of self-reactive T cells.
