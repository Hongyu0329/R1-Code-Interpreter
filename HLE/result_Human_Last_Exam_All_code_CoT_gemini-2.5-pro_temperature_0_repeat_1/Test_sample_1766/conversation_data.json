    "To solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: A \"p-electron\" has an orbital angular momentum quantum number `l=1` and a spin quantum number `s=1/2` (since it's an electron).\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is obtained by coupling `l` and `s`. The possible values of `j` range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n    *   `j_min = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n    *   `j_max = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n    *   So, the possible `j` values are `1/2` and `3/2`.\n3.  **Find Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j)**: For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Determine Eigenvalues**:\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by the formula $\\hbar m_j$.\n5.  **Calculate and Display**: We will write a Python script to calculate these eigenvalues for each possible state, which is defined by a pair of `(j, m_j)`. The script will print the full eigenvalue equations, showing how the eigenvalues are derived from the quantum numbers. We will use the `fractions` module for a clear representation of the half-integer values and express the eigenvalues in units of $\\hbar^2$ and $\\hbar$.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \n    A p-electron has orbital angular momentum l=1 and spin s=1/2.\n    The total angular momentum J is the sum of L and S.\n    The eigenvalues of J^2 are j(j+1) h_bar^2.\n    The eigenvalues of J_z are m_j h_bar.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l={l} and s={s}.\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate possible j values from |l-s| to l+s\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    j_values = [Fraction(j) for j in np.arange(float(j_min), float(j_max) + 1, 1.0)]\n\n    # Iterate through each possible j value\n    for j in sorted(j_values, reverse=True):\n        print(f\"--- For states with total angular momentum j = {j} ---\")\n        \n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        # m_j values range from -j to j in integer steps\n        m_j_values = [Fraction(m) for m in np.arange(float(-j), float(j) + 1, 1.0)]\n        \n        # Iterate through each m_j for the given j\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            state_ket = f\"|j={j}, m_j={m_j}>\"\n            \n            # Print the eigenvalue equation for J^2\n            print(f\"For state {state_ket}:\")\n            print(f\"  J^2 {state_ket} = {j}*({j}+1) h_bar^2 {state_ket} = {j2_eigenvalue} h_bar^2 {state_ket}\")\n            \n            # Print the eigenvalue equation for J_z\n            print(f\"  J_z {state_ket} = {m_j} h_bar {state_ket}\\n\")\n\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```"
