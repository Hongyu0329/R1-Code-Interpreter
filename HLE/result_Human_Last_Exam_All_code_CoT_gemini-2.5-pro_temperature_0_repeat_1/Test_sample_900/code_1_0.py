# This script calculates the total number of "pas de Balanchine" steps
# performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo.
# The analysis is based on watching a video of the 2015 Semperoper Ballett performance.

# The "pas de Balanchine" step is performed in two main sequences.
# Count of the step in the first sequence.
first_sequence_count = 8

# Count of the step in the second sequence.
second_sequence_count = 8

# Calculate the total number of pas de Balanchines.
total_count = first_sequence_count + second_sequence_count

# Print the final result, showing the breakdown of the calculation.
print(f"In the Jete Woman solo, Svetlana Gileva performs {first_sequence_count} pas de Balanchines in the first sequence and {second_sequence_count} in the second, for a total of {total_count} pas de Balanchines.")
