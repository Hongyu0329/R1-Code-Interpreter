    # CTIS uses tomographic reconstruction, which requires multiple "projections" of the data.
    print("\nStep 2: The method, Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), requires multiple different 'projections' of the scene's spectral information to reconstruct the data cube.")

    # Step 3: Explain the role of the grating.
    # A grating disperses light. To get multiple projections for tomography, we need to disperse light in multiple directions.
    print("\nStep 3: A diffraction grating is used to create these projections by dispersing light. A simple 1D grating only disperses light along one axis, which is insufficient for a robust 2D reconstruction.")

    # A single 2D diffraction grating creates a 2D pattern of dispersed images (projections) on the sensor.
    print("\nStep 4: A single physical component, a 2D diffraction grating, is used. This one grating disperses light into a 2D grid of diffraction orders. Each order acts as a unique projection of the spectral data.")

    print("   - The higher orders (+1, -1, etc., in x and y) are dispersed images.")
