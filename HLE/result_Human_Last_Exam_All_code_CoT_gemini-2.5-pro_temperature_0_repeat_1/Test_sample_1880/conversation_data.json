    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for analyzing quartic polynomials.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, we'll establish that the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Eisenstein's criterion is a suitable tool for this.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant**: The Galois group of an irreducible quartic is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The discriminant, $\\Delta$, of the polynomial will tell us if the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: To further distinguish between the possible Galois groups ($S_4, A_4, D_4, C_4, V_4$), we will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial associated with our quartic.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: The reducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides crucial information. We will check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem to determine if it's reducible.\n5.  **Determine the Group and its Order**: By combining the information from the discriminant (is it a square?) and the resolvent cubic (is it reducible?), we can uniquely identify the Galois group and its order from the known classification.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n\n\n# The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n# In the form x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, the coefficients are:\na = 0\nb = 0\nc = 8\nd = 14\n\nprint(f\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + {c}x + {d}\\n\")\n\n# Step 1: Check for irreducibility\nprint(\"--- Step 1: Check for Irreducibility ---\")\n# We apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2.\n# 1. p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\n# 2. p=2 divides all other coefficients (c=8, d=14).\n# 3. p^2=4 does not divide the constant term (d=14).\nprint(\"By Eisenstein's criterion with p=2, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\nprint(\"This means the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of S_4.\\n\")\n\n\n# Step 2: Compute the discriminant\nprint(\"--- Step 2: Compute the Discriminant ---\")\n# For a depressed quartic x^4 + cx + d, the discriminant is Δ = 256*d^3 - 27*c^4.\ndiscriminant = 256 * (d**3) - 27 * (c**4)\nprint(f\"The discriminant formula is Δ = 256*d^3 - 27*c^4\")\nprint(f\"Δ = 256 * ({d}^3) - 27 * ({c}^4)\")\nprint(f\"Δ = 256 * {d**3} - 27 * {c**4}\")\nprint(f\"Δ = {256 * d**3} - {27 * c**4}\")\nprint(f\"Δ = {discriminant}\")\n\nis_square = is_perfect_square(discriminant)\nprint(f\"Is the discriminant a perfect square in Q? {is_square}\")\nif not is_square:\n    print(\"Since Δ is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of A_4.\")\n    print(\"Possible groups: S_4, D_4, C_4.\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Since Δ is a perfect square, the Galois group is a subgroup of A_4.\")\n    print(\"Possible groups: A_4, V_4.\\n\")\n\n\n# Step 3: Form the resolvent cubic\nprint(\"--- Step 3: Form the Resolvent Cubic ---\")\n# For x^4 + cx + d, the resolvent cubic is g(y) = y^3 - 4*d*y - c^2.\nres_c0 = -(c**2)\nres_c1 = -4 * d\nprint(f\"The resolvent cubic formula is g(y) = y^3 - 4*d*y - c^2\")\nprint(f\"g(y) = y^3 - 4*({d})*y - ({c}^2)\")\nprint(f\"g(y) = y^3 + {res_c1}y + {res_c0}\\n\")\n\n\n# Step 4: Analyze the resolvent cubic\nprint(\"--- Step 4: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic ---\")\n# Check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\n# Possible rational roots must be integer divisors of the constant term -64.\nconstant_term = abs(res_c0)\ndivisors = [i for i in range(1, constant_term + 1) if constant_term % i == 0]\nrational_roots = []\nfor r in divisors + [-i for i in divisors]:\n    if r**3 + res_c1 * r + res_c0 == 0:\n        rational_roots.append(r)\n\nif len(rational_roots) > 0:\n    is_resolvent_reducible = True\n    print(f\"The resolvent cubic has rational root(s): {rational_roots}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the resolvent cubic is reducible over Q.\\n\")\nelse:\n    is_resolvent_reducible = False\n    print(\"The resolvent cubic has no rational roots, so it is irreducible over Q.\\n\")\n\n\n# Step 5: Determine the Galois group and its order\nprint(\"--- Step 5: Determine the Galois Group and its Order ---\")\nprint(\"Summary of findings:\")\nprint(f\"  - The polynomial is irreducible.\")\nprint(f\"  - The discriminant ({discriminant}) is NOT a perfect square.\")\nprint(f\"  - The resolvent cubic is REDUCIBLE over Q.\")\n\n# Classification:\n# - Irreducible, Δ not square, resolvent irreducible -> S_4 (order 24)\n# - Irreducible, Δ not square, resolvent reducible   -> D_4 or C_4 (order 8 or 4)\n# - Irreducible, Δ square, resolvent irreducible     -> A_4 (order 12)\n# - Irreducible, Δ square, resolvent reducible       -> V_4 (order 4)\n#\n# To distinguish D_4 from C_4, we check if all roots of the resolvent are rational.\n# If only one root is rational, the group is D_4.\n# Our resolvent is g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64.
