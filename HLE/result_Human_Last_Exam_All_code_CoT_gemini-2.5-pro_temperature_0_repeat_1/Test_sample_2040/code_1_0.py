    Explains whether free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit

    explanation = """
Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit second-order nonlinear effects is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion symmetry.

Boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are 2D materials that can exist in several different atomic structures, or phases. The most commonly studied and synthesized phases of borophene (such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are known to be centrosymmetric. This means they possess a center of inversion symmetry.

In any material with inversion symmetry, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, χ⁽²⁾, is identically zero. Since the strength of SPDC is dependent on this χ⁽²⁾ value, the process is considered forbidden in the bulk of such materials.

Therefore, pristine, unstrained, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.

It is worth noting a few caveats:
1.  **Symmetry Breaking:** If the material's inversion symmetry were to be broken, SPDC could be enabled. This could potentially be achieved by applying mechanical strain, introducing defects, interacting with a substrate, or applying a strong external DC electric field.
2.  **Higher-Order Processes:** While the second-order process (SPDC) is forbidden, centrosymmetric materials can still exhibit third-order nonlinear processes (governed by χ⁽³⁾). A process called Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM), for example, can also generate pairs of photons and occurs in centrosymmetric materials like silicon and graphene.
