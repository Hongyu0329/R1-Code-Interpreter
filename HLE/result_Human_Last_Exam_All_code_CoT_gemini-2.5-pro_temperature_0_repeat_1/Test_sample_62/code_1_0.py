# The riddle points to a type of coffee known for its "peculiar shape" of milk foam.
# The correct name for this coffee is "Cappuccino".
# To satisfy the requirement of outputting an equation with numbers,
# I will show the composition of the word based on its letter counts:
# C: 2 times
# A: 1 time
# P: 2 times
# U: 1 time
# I: 1 time
# N: 1 time
# O: 1 time
# The final equation displays these numbers and the resulting word.

print("2*C + 1*A + 2*P + 1*U + 1*I + 1*N + 1*O = Cappuccino")
