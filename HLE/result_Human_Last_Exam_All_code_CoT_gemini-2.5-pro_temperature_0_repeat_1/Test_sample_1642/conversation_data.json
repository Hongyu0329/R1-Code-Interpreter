    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** The user asks for the maximum number `m` where `m` white queens and `m` black queens can be on a 16x16 board \"without attacking each other\". The most direct interpretation of this phrasing is that no queen on the board can attack any other queen, regardless of its color.\n2.  **Relate to a Known Problem:** This transforms the problem into a standard N-Queens puzzle. We have a total of `2m` queens that must be placed on a 16x16 board in a non-attacking configuration.\n3.  **Apply the N-Queens Theorem:** A fundamental result of the N-Queens problem is that the maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on an NÃ—N chessboard is N.\n4.  **Formulate an Inequality:** For our 16x16 board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is 16. Therefore, the total number of queens we are placing, `2m`, must be less than or equal to 16.\n5.  **Solve for m:** The inequality is `2 * m <= 16`. Solving for `m` gives `m <= 8`.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The maximum integer value for `m` is 8.\n7.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that outlines this logic and prints the steps of the calculation, including the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queen_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens\n    can coexist on an N x N chessboard without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the size of the chessboard\n    N = 16\n\n    # The problem involves placing m white queens and m black queens.\n    # The total number of queens is 2 * m.\n    # The condition \"without attacking each other\" implies that no queen can attack\n    # any other queen on the board, regardless of color.\n\n    # This is equivalent to the classic N-Queens problem, which determines the\n    # maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on a board.\n    # For an N x N board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is N.\n    max_total_queens = N\n\n    # Therefore, the total number of queens we place (2 * m) must be\n    # less than or equal to the maximum possible number of non-attacking queens.\n    # This gives us the inequality: 2 * m <= N\n\n    # We solve this inequality for m to find the maximum value.\n    # m <= N / 2\n    max_m = max_total_queens / 2\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the constraints.\")\n    print(f\"We have a {N}x{N} chessboard.\")\n    print(\"We need to place 'm' white queens and 'm' black queens.\")\n    print(\"The condition is that no queen attacks any other queen.\")\n    print(f\"This means the total number of non-attacking queens is m + m = 2 * m.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the N-Queens problem principle.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking queens on a {N}x{N} board is {N}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Formulate and solve the inequality.\")\n    print(\"The total number of queens (2 * m) cannot exceed the maximum possible.\")\n    print(\"This gives us the final equation:\")\n    print(f\"2 * m <= {max_total_queens}\")\n    print(f\"m <= {max_total_queens} / 2\")\n    print(f\"m <= {int(max_m)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(f\"The maximum number m is {int(max_m)}.\")\n\nsolve_queen_problem()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
