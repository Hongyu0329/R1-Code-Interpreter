    "To solve this riddle, we need to understand Isaac Newton's analogy between the visible color spectrum and the notes of a musical scale.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Colors:** First, we'll determine the specific colors mentioned in the question. The first color is the result of combining yellow and blue, which is green. The second color is blue.\n2.  **Consult Newton's Analogy:** We will refer to Newton's mapping of colors to musical notes. In a common interpretation, the musical notes act as the boundaries between the color regions on his circle.\n3.  **Map the Colors to Notes:** We'll find the musical intervals that correspond to the colors green and blue.\n    *   Green is the color in the interval between note F and note G.\n    *   Blue is the color in the interval between note G and note A.\n4.  **Find the Boundary Note:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the \"range between\" green and blue. In this model, the note that acts as the boundary separating the green region from the blue region is the answer.\n5.  **Generate Code:** The Python code will print out this step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by mapping Newton's color circle to a musical scale.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This problem requires understanding Isaac Newton's analogy between the color spectrum and a musical scale.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify the colors in the question.\")\n    color1_component1 = \"yellow\"\n    color1_component2 = \"blue\"\n    color1_result = \"green\"\n    color2 = \"blue\"\n    print(f\"The first color is the result of combining {color1_component1} and {color1_component2}, which is {color1_result}.\")\n    print(f\"The second color is {color2}.\")\n    print(\"The question asks for the note corresponding to the range between green and blue.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Map the colors to Newton's musical scale analogy.\")\n    print(\"In one common interpretation of Newton's color circle, the musical notes serve as the boundaries between the color regions.\")\n    print(\"The diatonic scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) is mapped as follows:\")\n    print(\"  - The color Green occupies the musical space between note F and note G.\")\n    print(\"  - The color Blue occupies the musical space between note G and note A.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Determine the note for the specified range.\")\n    note_f = \"F\"\n    note_g = \"G\"\n    note_a = \"A\"\n    print(f\"The range 'between' the color green (the interval {note_f}-{note_g}) and the color blue (the interval {note_g}-{note_a}) is the single note they share as a boundary.\")\n    \n    final_note = \"G\"\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the musical note that separates the green region from the blue region is: {final_note}\")\n\nsolve_newton_riddle()\n```\n<<<G>>>"
