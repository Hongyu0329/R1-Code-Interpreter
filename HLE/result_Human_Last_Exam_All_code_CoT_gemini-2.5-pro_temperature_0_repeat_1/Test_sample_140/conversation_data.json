    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal packing strategy for 9x1x1 blocks inside a 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes (15*15*15 / 9*1*1 = 375) gives an upper bound, but it doesn't account for the wasted space due to the shapes not fitting perfectly.\n\nA more effective method is to partition the cube into smaller cuboids that can be filled efficiently.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will partition the 15x15x15 cube along one of its axes. Since a block has a length of 9, a natural partition of the 15-unit length is into 9 and 6. This splits the cube into a 9x15x15 cuboid and a 6x15x15 cuboid.\n2.  I'll calculate the maximum number of blocks that can fit in the first cuboid (9x15x15) by aligning the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 9-unit side of the cuboid.\n3.  Then, I'll take the remaining cuboid (6x15x15) and repeat the process, partitioning it along another axis into a 6x9x15 cuboid and a 6x6x15 cuboid.\n4.  I'll calculate the blocks that fit in the 6x9x15 part.\n5.  Finally, I'll partition the last remaining piece (6x6x15) into a 6x6x9 piece and a 6x6x6 piece. I'll calculate the blocks that fit in the 6x6x9 part.\n6.  The final leftover piece will be a 6x6x6 cube, into which no 9x1x1 block can fit.\n7.  The total number of blocks will be the sum of the blocks from the three filled partitions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the largest number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit inside a 15x15x15 cube, we can partition the cube.\")\n\n    # Partition 1\n    # We split the 15x15x15 cube into a 9x15x15 cuboid and a 6x15x15 cuboid.\n    # In the 9x15x15 part, we align the blocks' 9-unit length with the 9-unit side.\n    blocks_part1 = (9 // 9) * (15 // 1) * (15 // 1)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: Partition the 15x15x15 cube into a 9x15x15 piece and a 6x15x15 piece.\")\n    print(f\"The 9x15x15 piece can be filled with (9/9) * (15/1) * (15/1) = {blocks_part1} blocks.\")\n\n    # Partition 2\n    # We are left with a 6x15x15 cuboid.
