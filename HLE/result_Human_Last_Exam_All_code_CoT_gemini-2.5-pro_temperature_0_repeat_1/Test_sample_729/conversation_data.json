    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128. This group, denoted as $Q_{128}$, has the presentation $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. Its elements are of the form $x^i$ or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\n\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of distinct sets $G^k$ for $Q_{128}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Powers of Elements:** We need to compute $g^k$ for every element $g \\in Q_{128}$.\n    *   If $g = x^i$, then $g^k = (x^i)^k = x^{ik}$.\n    *   If $g = x^i y$, its powers behave differently. For example, $(x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i (y x^i y^{-1}) y^2 = x^i x^{-i} y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$. This means for any even power $k=2m$, $(x^i y)^k = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$. For any odd power $k=2m+1$, $(x^i y)^k = x^{32m} (x^i y)$.\n\n4.  **Characterize the Power Subgroups $G^k$:**\n    *   **Case 1: $k$ is odd.**\n        Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$, so the set $\\{x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ is equal to $\\langle x \\rangle$. The set of odd powers of elements like $x^i y$ will cover all elements of the form $x^j y$. Therefore, for any odd $k$, $G^k = Q_{128}$. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2: $k$ is even.**\n        Let $k=2m$. The set of powers is $G^k = \\{x^{ik}\\} \\cup \\{(x^j y)^k\\}$. As shown above, $(x^j y)^k = x^{32m} = x^{16k}$. This element is already contained within the set $\\{x^{ik}\\}$ (since $x^{16k} = (x^k)^{16}$). Thus, for any even $k$, the power subgroup is simply $G^k = \\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups:**\n    The distinct subgroups of the form $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ are determined by $\\gcd(k, 64)$. Since we are considering only even $k$, we need to find how many distinct values $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ can take for an even $k$.\n    If $k$ is even, $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ must also be even. The divisors of 64 are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$. The even divisors are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$. For each of these 6 even divisors $d$, we can choose $k=d$ to get the subgroup $\\langle x^d \\rangle$. This gives us **6** distinct power subgroups.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum from the two cases: $1$ (from odd $k$) + $6$ (from even $k$) = $7$.\n\nTo verify this theoretical result, I will write a Python script that simulates the group $Q_{128}$, computes the power subgroups $G^k$ for $k$ from 0 to 64 (the exponent of the group), and counts how many unique subgroups are formed.\n\n```python\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Plan:\n    # 1.
