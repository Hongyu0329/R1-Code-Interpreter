    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Definition:** The \"index\" of a boundary-value problem refers to the number of linearly independent boundary conditions provided. The details of the differential equation itself, such as the matrix `A` or the function `I(t)`, are not needed to determine this index.\n2.  **List the Boundary Conditions:** I will write down all the given boundary conditions and examine their mathematical form.\n3.  **Check for Linear Independence:** I will analyze the set of boundary conditions to identify any dependencies. A condition is linearly dependent if it can be expressed as a linear combination of the other conditions.\n    *   The conditions involving `x_2` appear to be multiples of each other. For example, `5x₂(T) - 5x₂(0) = 0` is just `5 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0)`. I will consolidate these into a single independent condition.\n    *   The conditions for `x_1`, `x_2`, and `x_2024` involve different variables, making them linearly independent from each other.\n4.  **Count the Independent Conditions:** The total count of these unique, linearly independent conditions will be the index of the problem.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to formalize this process. The script will represent the boundary conditions as rows in a coefficient matrix and then use the `numpy` library to calculate the matrix's rank. The rank of this matrix is, by definition, the number of linearly independent rows, which corresponds to the index of the problem. The code will also print out the step-by-step logic and the final equation for the index as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the index of the problem.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_problem_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem\n    by determining the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The boundary conditions can be written in a matrix form where each row\n    # represents the coefficients of a single condition.
