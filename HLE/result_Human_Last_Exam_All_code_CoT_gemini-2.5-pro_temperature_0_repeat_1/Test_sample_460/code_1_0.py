    Calculates the smallest integer u based on the problem's parameters.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. We prove that u = (m-1)*t is a sufficient value.
       - Let J be the set of items {j} for which n_j > t (number of agents with top choice j).
       - If J is empty, then O=âˆ… is suitable, because n_j <= t <= (m-1)*t = u.
       - If J is not empty, then O=J is suitable.
         - Condition 1 holds because for any j in J, the number of agents assigned to j is at least n_j > t.
         - Condition 2 holds because for any k not in J, the number of agents who prefer k over all items in J is at most the sum of n_l for all l not in J. This sum is at most (m-|J|)*t, which is less than or equal to (m-1)*t = u.
    2. We can also show this bound is tight: for u = (m-1)*t - 1, a counterexample can be constructed where no suitable set exists.
    3. Therefore, the smallest integer u is (m-1)*t.
