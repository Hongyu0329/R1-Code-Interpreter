    """
    Analyzes the clinical case to determine the most likely disease.
    The patient profile and symptoms strongly point towards a specific diagnosis.
    
    Key factors considered:
    1. Risk Factors: 62-year-old male, 20-pack-year smoking history, shipbuilding work (asbestos risk).
    2. Initial Symptoms: Polyarthritis (joint pain/swelling), fatigue - suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
    3. Progressive Symptoms: Neurological (confusion), hematological (bruising), dysphagia, shortness of breath.
    4. Clinical Findings: Multiple pulmonary nodules on chest X-ray.
    5. Final Outcome: Immunocompromised state (likely from cancer and steroids) leading to a fatal opportunistic infection and septic shock.
    
    Conclusion: The combination of risk factors, paraneoplastic syndromes, and pulmonary nodules makes one diagnosis far more likely than others.
