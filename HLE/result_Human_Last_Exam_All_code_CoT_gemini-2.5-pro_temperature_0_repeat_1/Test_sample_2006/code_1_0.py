    Solves the math riddle presented in the haiku.

    # 1. Identify the numbers from the haiku
    # "An August tempest" -> August is the 8th month

    # "Twice fifteen" -> 2 * 15
    n2 = 30

    # "tempest" suggests multiplication (*)
    # "winds of change" suggests subtraction (-)

    # "in alphabetical order what is the answer?"
    # This is interpreted as sorting the digits of the result.
