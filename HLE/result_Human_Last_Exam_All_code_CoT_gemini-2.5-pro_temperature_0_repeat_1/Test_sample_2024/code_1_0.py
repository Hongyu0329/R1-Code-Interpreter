    # Let v_T be the truth value of the atomic predicate T(x, y, z).
    # The truth of T(x, y, z) is about a specific world z, so its value is
    # independent of the world of evaluation.
    # v(Box(T(x, y, z))) in any world w is min({v(T(x, y, z)) in w' for w' accessible from w}).
    # Since v(T(x, y, z)) is constant, v(Box(T(x, y, z))) = v_T.
    # The truth value of the implication I is v(I) = max(1 - v_T, v(Box(T(x, y, z))))

    # ATV: forall x,y,z (T(x,y,z) -> Box(forall w (R(z,w) -> T(x,y,w))))
    # Since ATV is an axiom, its truth value is always 1.
    # This means for any instance (x,y,z), the implication must have value 1.
    # v(Imp_ATV) = max(1 - v(T(x,y,z)), v(Consequent)) = 1.
    # This implies that if v(T(x,y,z)) > 0, then v(Consequent) must be 1.
    # The consequent's value is min({v(T(x,y,w')) for all w' accessible from z}).
    # So, if v(T(x,y,z)) > 0, then min({v(T(x,y,w')) for w' accessible from z}) = 1.
    # This means v(T(x,y,w')) must be 1 for all w' accessible from z.
    # Since the accessibility relation R is reflexive, z is accessible from itself.
    # Therefore, v(T(x,y,z)) must be 1.
    # This leads to a crucial conclusion: if v(T(x,y,z)) is not 0, it must be 1.
    # The predicate T(x,y,z) can only have truth values 0 or 1. It is bivalent.

    # From Step 4, we know v_T can only be 0 or 1.

    # Since the implication I is always 1 for any instance, the universally
    # quantified statement P = forall x,y,z (I) also has a truth value of 1.
    # The final statement is S = Box(P). Its truth value in w1 is
