    "To find the observer canonical form of the given discrete-time system, we will use the principle of duality. This principle connects the observability of a system (A, C) to the controllability of its dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ). The observer canonical form for the original system can be found by first transforming the dual system into its controller canonical form.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Dual System**: We start with the given system matrices A and C. The dual system is defined by matrices A_d = Aᵀ and B_d = Cᵀ.\n2.  **Find the Transformation Matrix for Controller Canonical Form**: We will find a transformation matrix `T` that converts the dual system (A_d, B_d) into its controller canonical form (A_c, B_c). This involves:\n    a.  Constructing the controllability matrix of the dual system to find the controllability indices (μ₁, μ₂).\n    b.  Forming a matrix `M` from the linearly independent column vectors of the controllability matrix.\n    c.  Calculating the inverse of `M`. Specific rows of `M⁻¹` are used to construct the transformation matrix `T`.\n3.  **Calculate Canonical Matrices**: Once `T` is found, we can compute the B matrix for the controller canonical form of the dual system as `B_c = T * B_d`.\n4.  **Apply Duality**: The new C matrix for the observer canonical form of the original system, which we'll call `C_o`, is simply the transpose of `B_c`. That is, `C_o = B_cᵀ`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the new matrix C.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reduces a discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given system matrices\n    A = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n                  [2, 1, 1],\n                  [0, 2, 0]])\n    C = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                  [1, 1, 0]])\n\n    print(\"Original A matrix:\\n\", A)\n    print(\"Original C matrix:\\n\", C)\n\n    # Step 1: Form the dual system (A_d = A^T, B_d = C^T)\n    A_d = A.T\n    B_d = C.T\n\n    print(\"\\nDual system matrix A_d (A^T):\\n\", A_d)\n    print(\"Dual system matrix B_d (C^T):\\n\", B_d)\n\n    # Step 2: Find the transformation matrix T for the dual system.\n    # This requires finding the controllability indices and constructing M.\n    # For this multi-input system, we analyze the columns of the controllability matrix\n    # Q_c = [b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ...].\n    # The linearly independent vectors are b1, A_d*b1, and b2.\n    # This gives controllability indices mu_1 = 2 and mu_2 = 1.\n    \n    # Get columns of B_d\n    b1 = B_d[:, 0:1]\n    b2 = B_d[:, 1:2]\n\n    # Form the matrix M from the selected linearly independent vectors: [b1, A_d*b1, b2]\n    M = np.hstack([b1, A_d @ b1, b2])\n    \n    print(\"\\nMatrix M for transformation:\\n\", M)\n\n    # Check if M is invertible (i.e., if the dual system is controllable)\n    if np.linalg.det(M) == 0:\n        print(\"\\nDual system is not controllable.
