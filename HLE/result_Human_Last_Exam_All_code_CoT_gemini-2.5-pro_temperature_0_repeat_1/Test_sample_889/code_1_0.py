# Define the four numbers for the puzzle
num1 = 3
num2 = 3
num3 = 7
num4 = 7

# The goal is to form an expression that equals 24.
# The solution involves using fractions.
# The equation is (3 + 3/7) * 7 = 24.
# Let's represent this using our variables.
# Note: The order of numbers in the print statement reflects the final equation.
