    The fundamental principle of modern cryptography is that security rests on the secrecy of a key.
    If an adversary knows the key used to encrypt data, they can, by definition, perform the decryption.
    Let's analyze the options based on this fact:

    - A, D, E (Quantum Methods): These are advanced ways to generate or transmit keys securely. They don't change the fact that if the final key is known, the system is compromised.
    - B, C (Key Management): These methods limit the damage of a key compromise to a specific time window or session. They do not provide security for the data encrypted with the key that is currently known to the adversary.

    Conclusion: The premise of the question describes a scenario that is, by definition, insecure. No system can remain secure if the key is compromised.
