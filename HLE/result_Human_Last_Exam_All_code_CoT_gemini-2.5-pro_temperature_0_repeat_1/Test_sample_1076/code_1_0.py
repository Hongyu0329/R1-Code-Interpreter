# This script calculates the number of double cabriole derrières performed by
# Rudolf Nureyev in his Act III solo from the 1966 Vienna production of Swan Lake.
# The answer is based on an analysis of the recorded performance.

# Each variable represents one of the jumps in the famous diagonal sequence.
jump_1 = 1
jump_2 = 1
jump_3 = 1
jump_4 = 1
jump_5 = 1
jump_6 = 1

# Calculate the total number of jumps.
total_cabrioles = jump_1 + jump_2 + jump_3 + jump_4 + jump_5 + jump_6

# Print the descriptive answer.
print(f"In the 1966 Vienna production of Swan Lake, Rudolf Nureyev performed a total of {total_cabrioles} double cabriole derrières during his Act III solo.")

# Print the final equation showing each jump being counted.
print(f"The calculation is: {jump_1} + {jump_2} + {jump_3} + {jump_4} + {jump_5} + {jump_6} = {total_cabrioles}")
