    This function provides the solution to the problem based on analytical derivations.
    
    Let f(t) = cos(pi*t)^2.
    Let S be the set of pairs (x,y) of real numbers such that:
    1) y = f(sin(pi*x)) = cos^2(pi*sin(pi*x))
    2) x = f(cos(2*pi*y)) = cos^2(pi*cos(2*pi*y))
    
    Task: Find the size of S and the number of pairs with at least one integer.
    
    1. Range of x and y:
       The range of f(t) is [0, 1]. Thus, any solution (x,y) must satisfy 0 <= x <= 1 and 0 <= y <= 1.
    
    2. Graphical Analysis (Size of S):
       - The graph of equation (1) in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1] forms two "U" shapes.
       - The graph of equation (2) in the unit square [0,1]x[0,1] forms four sideways "U" shapes.
       - A detailed graphical analysis shows that each of the two "U"s from eq (1) intersects each of the four sideways "U"s from eq (2) at two points.
       - This gives a total of 2 * 4 * 2 = 16 intersection points.
       - So, the size of S is 16.
    
    3. Pairs with at least one integer:
       We check for solutions where x or y is 0 or 1.
       - If x=0, eq(1) gives y=1. Checking (0,1) in eq(2) gives 0 = cos^2(pi*cos(2*pi)) = 1, a contradiction.
       - If y=0, eq(2) gives x=1. Checking (1,0) in eq(1) gives 0 = cos^2(pi*sin(pi)) = 1, a contradiction.
       - If x=1, eq(1) gives y=1. Checking (1,1) in eq(2) gives 1 = cos^2(pi*cos(2*pi)) = 1, which is true. So (1,1) is a solution.
       - If y=1, eq(2) gives x=1, leading to the same solution (1,1).
       - The only pair with an integer component is (1,1). There is 1 such pair.
