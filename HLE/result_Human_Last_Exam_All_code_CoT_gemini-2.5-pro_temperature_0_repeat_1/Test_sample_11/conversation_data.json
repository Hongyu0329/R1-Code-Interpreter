    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nHere is my plan to find the answer:\n1.  I will search my knowledge base for key Israeli statutes and legal principles.\n2.  I will specifically look for the introduction of the legal concept of \"good faith\" (or *tom lev* in Hebrew) as a general principle in Israeli law.\n3.  The most prominent statute that codified this principle, moving Israeli law away from its English common law roots (which lacked a general good faith doctrine) and towards a more civil law approach, is the Contracts (General Part) Law. This law is widely recognized for formally and explicitly introducing the duty of good faith into negotiations and the performance of contracts.\n4.  I will then create a Python script to print the name of this statute as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_israeli_statute():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the first major Israeli statute\n    to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" as a general principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, is widely recognized as the\n    # foundational statute that introduced the duty of good faith into Israeli law,\n    # particularly in sections 12 and 39.\n    statute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n    print(statute_name)\n\nfind_israeli_statute()\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
