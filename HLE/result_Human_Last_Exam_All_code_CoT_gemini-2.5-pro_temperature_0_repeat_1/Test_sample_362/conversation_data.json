    "My plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Structures**: First, I will identify the two reactants from the prompt: the carbonyl compound, which is pivalaldehyde, and the phosphorus ylide, which is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane. I will then deduce their chemical structures.\n    *   Pivalaldehyde (or 2,2-dimethylpropanal) has the structure `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`.\n    *   The ylide's name indicates a triphenylphosphine (`PPh₃`) core. The `ethylidene` part (`=CH-CH₃`) is double-bonded to the phosphorus. The `2-(2-chlorophenyl)` group substitutes a hydrogen on the second carbon of the ethylidene group. This gives the ylide structure `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(o-Cl-Ph)`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Wittig Reaction Mechanism**: The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. The oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group (`C=O`) is exchanged with the doubly-bonded carbon group of the phosphorus ylide (`=CR¹R²`). This forms a new C=C double bond and a stable by-product, triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph₃P=O`).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure**: I will combine the non-carbonyl part of the aldehyde (`(CH₃)₃C-CH=`) with the non-phosphorus part of the ylide (`=CH-CH₂(o-Cl-Ph)`). This will yield the alkene product with the structure `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(o-Cl-Ph)`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product**: I will determine the systematic IUPAC name for the product. This involves finding the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond, numbering it to give the double bond the lowest possible number, and then naming and numbering the substituents accordingly.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code**: Finally, I will create a Python script that encapsulates this logic. The script will print the complete reaction equation with the full names of the reactants and products. As requested, the code will also explicitly detail the meaning of each number in the final product's IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the product of the Wittig reaction between\n    pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\n    and prints the full reaction details.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
