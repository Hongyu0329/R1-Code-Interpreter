    # Part 1: Identify which of the 20 objects generate a prime tt-ideal.
    # An object generates a prime ideal if it falls into one of two classes:
    # Class A: Tate-acyclic but non-trivial on restriction (generates P_e).
    # Class B: Trivial on restriction but not Tate-acyclic (generates P_{C_p, (0)}).

    # Objects of Class A are related to the projective module kC_p.
    # 2. kC_p(0) is projective, hence Tate-acyclic. Its restriction is k^p, non-trivial.
    # 4, 5, 6. rad(kC_p) and its gapped versions have kC_p as the underlying module,
    # so they share the same properties in this context.

    # 7. cone(τ) is trivial on restriction but has non-trivial Tate cohomology.
    # 8, 9, 10. Tensor powers of cone(τ) inherit these properties.
    # 15. The ghost complex S is defined to be trivial on restriction but is not Tate-acyclic.
    # 18. S ⊗ cone(τ) is a tensor product of two objects from Class B, so it is also in Class B.

    # Part 2: Count the prime tt-ideals not generated by any of these objects.
    # The category K has three prime tt-ideals: P_e, P_{C_p, (0)}, and P_{C_p, m}.
    # P_e is generated by objects in Class A (e.g., object 2).
    # P_{C_p, (0)} is generated by objects in Class B (e.g., object 7).
    # The maximal ideal, P_{C_p, m}, cannot be generated by a single object.
    # Therefore, there is 1 prime ideal not generated by any object on the list.
