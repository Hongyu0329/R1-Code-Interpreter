    "The problem asks for the value of a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED). This is a known sequence in mathematical physics.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  Identify the specific sequence. The number of these Feynman diagrams corresponds to sequence A000115 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n2.  The sequence provides the values of a(n) for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n    *   a(1) = 1 (for order 2*1 = 2)\n    *   a(2) = 2 (for order 2*2 = 4)\n    *   a(3) = 10 (for order 2*3 = 6)\n    *   a(4) = 74 (for order 2*4 = 8)\n3.  The question asks for a(3).\n4.  I will write a Python script that stores these known values and retrieves the value for n=3, printing the result in a clear format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagram_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(3) from the sequence a(n) for the number of non-vanishing\n    Feynman diagrams of order 2n in QED.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sequence a(n) gives the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of\n    # order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics.\n    # The first few known values of the sequence are stored in a dictionary.\n    # The key is 'n' and the value is 'a(n)'.\n    a_n_values = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 10,\n        4: 74,\n        5: 706\n    }\n\n    # The problem asks for the value of a(3).\n    n = 3\n\n    # Retrieve the value from the dictionary.\n    if n in a_n_values:\n        result = a_n_values[n]\n        # The problem asks to show the numbers in the final equation.\n        # We will print the relationship a(n) = result.\n        print(f\"The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n is given by the sequence a(n).\")\n        print(f\"For n = {n}, the order is 2*n = {2*n}.\")\n        print(f\"The value is a({n}) = {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The value for a({n}) is not available in the pre-computed list.\")\n\nsolve_feynman_diagram_count()\n```\n<<<10>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics, what is a(3)?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
