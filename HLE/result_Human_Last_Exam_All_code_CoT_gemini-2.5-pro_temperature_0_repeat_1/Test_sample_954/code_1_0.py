def solve():
    """
    This function solves the graph process problem by providing the determined bounds.
    The analysis is based on constructing a specific family of trees that maximizes the process duration.

    The reasoning leads to the following bounds for the maximum number of steps T(n):
    1. For max degree Delta <= sqrt(log n): T(n) = Theta(sqrt(log n)). This corresponds to category 6.
    2. For max degree Delta <= log n: T(n) = Theta(log(n)/log(log(n))). This corresponds to category 7.
    3. For any forest: T(n) = Theta(log(n)/log(log(n))). This corresponds to category 7.

    The resulting three-digit number is formed by these category numbers.
