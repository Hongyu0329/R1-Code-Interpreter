    "To determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death, we will use historical data.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Establish the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n2.  Review Geoffrey Chaucer's biographical information for that year to determine his location and activities.\n3.  Conclude his location based on the evidence, particularly his role in the English court and the poem he wrote in her memory.\n4.  Present the information and the final conclusion in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chaucer_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints Geoffrey Chaucer's location\n    when Blanche of Lancaster died based on historical records.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish the date of death.\n    year_of_death = 1368\n    person_died = \"Blanche of Lancaster\"\n\n    # Step 2: Review Chaucer's biographical information for that period.\n    chaucers_location = \"England\"\n    chaucers_role = \"an esquire to King Edward III\"\n    commemorative_poem = \"The Book of the Duchess\"\n\n    # Step 3: Present the reasoning.\n    print(f\"To find Geoffrey Chaucer's location, we examine the historical timeline.\")\n    print(f\"{person_died} died in the year {year_of_death}.\")\n    print(f\"At that time, Geoffrey Chaucer was living and working in {chaucers_location}.\")\n    print(f\"He was serving as {chaucers_role}, a position within the English royal household.\")\n    print(f\"His first major poem, '{commemorative_poem}', was written as an elegy for Blanche.\")\n    print(\"This close connection to the court and the subject of his poem confirms he was in England during this period.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\")\n\nsolve_chaucer_location()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
