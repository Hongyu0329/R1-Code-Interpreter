# The group G is a Thompson-like group. Such groups are known to have
# low cohomological dimension. It is a standard result from the theory of
# such groups that their cohomological dimension over the reals is 2.
# Let cd_R(G) be the cohomological dimension of G with real coefficients.
# cd_R(G) = 2
#
# The homology H_k(G; R) is the dual of the cohomology H^k(G; R).
# For k > cd_R(G), the cohomology group H^k(G; R) is trivial (dimension 0).
# Therefore, H_k(G; R) is also trivial for k > cd_R(G).
#
# We are asked to compute the dimension of the homology in degree 31.
# Since 31 > 2, we have dim H_31(G; R) = 0.

degree = 31
homological_dimension = 2
result = 0

# The final equation is dim H_31(G, R) = 0
