    "The statement is **True**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_snp):** This is a theoretical concept. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being considered (e.g., all common SNPs on a genotyping chip). It is the *theoretical maximum* predictive power you could ever achieve if you knew the true effect size of every single SNP and used them in a perfect model. It's the ceiling for prediction.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability (R²):** This is a practical measure. A PGS is built using *estimated* effect sizes from a real-world Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Because the GWAS has a finite sample size, these effect size estimates are not perfect; they contain statistical noise and error. When you test this PGS on a *new, independent* set of individuals, its predictive ability (measured as R²) will be limited by these imperfections.\n\nIn essence, SNP heritability is the total amount of \"signal\" available from the SNPs. The PGS is our attempt to capture that signal. Due to limitations like finite sample sizes for the GWAS, imperfect statistical models, and differences between the GWAS and target populations, our PGS will never capture 100% of the available signal. Therefore, its predictive ability (R²) will necessarily be lower than the total available signal (h²_snp).\n\n<<<True>>>"
