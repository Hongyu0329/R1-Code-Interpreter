    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma, we will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This framework introduces quantum mechanics into the classical game through entanglement and expanded strategy spaces.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Setup the Quantum Game:**\n    *   The game starts with an initial state where the players' choices are maximally entangled. This is achieved by an entangling operator `J` acting on the initial classical state `|Cooperate, Cooperate>` (represented as `|00>`). We will use the standard maximal entanglement operator `J = (I ⊗ I + i * σ_x ⊗ σ_x) / sqrt(2)`.\n    *   Players' strategies are no longer just 'Cooperate' or 'Defect', but unitary operators from SU(2) that they apply to their respective qubits. A general strategy can be represented by `U(θ, φ)`.\n    *   The classical strategies 'Cooperate' (C) and 'Defect' (D) are embedded in this larger space, typically as `C = U(0, 0)` (the identity operator) and `D = U(π, 0)` (the Pauli `iσ_x` operator).\n\n2.  **Calculate Payoffs:**\n    *   After each player applies their strategy operator (`U_A` and `U_B`), the final state is disentangled by applying the conjugate transpose of the entangler, `J†`.\n    *   The state is then measured in the classical basis (`|00>`, `|01>`, `|10>`, `|11>`).\n    *   The expected payoff for each player is calculated by summing the payoffs of the four classical outcomes, weighted by their respective probabilities.\n\n3.  **Find the Nash Equilibrium:**\n    *   In the classical game, the only Nash Equilibrium is (Defect, Defect), leading to a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1).\n    *   In the quantum version with maximal entanglement, this classical equilibrium is no longer stable. A new, unique Nash Equilibrium emerges.\n    *   This new equilibrium strategy is `Q = U(θ=π/2, φ=0)`. When both players adopt this strategy, neither can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   We will write a Python script to calculate the outcome probabilities when both players choose the equilibrium strategy `Q`.\n    *   Using these probabilities and the given payoff matrix, we will calculate the equilibrium payoff for a player.\n    *   The script will print the full equation, showing how the final payoff is calculated from the probabilities and the payoff matrix values.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff matrix values: (R, S, T, P)\n    # (C,C) -> (R,R) = (5,5)\n    # (C,D) -> (S,T) = (0,7)\n    # (D,C) -> (T,S) = (7,0)\n    # (D,D) -> (P,P) = (1,1)\n    R, S, T, P = 5, 0, 7, 1\n\n    # Define Pauli-X and Identity matrices\n    I = np.identity(2, dtype=complex)\n    sigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Entangling operator J for maximal entanglement (gamma = pi/2)\n    J = (np.kron(I, I) + 1j * np.kron(sigma_x, sigma_x)) / np.sqrt(2)\n    J_H = J.conj().T # Hermitian conjugate\n\n    # Define the strategy operator U(theta, phi)\n    def U(theta, phi):\n        return np.array([\n            [np.cos(theta / 2), 1j * np.exp(-1j * phi) * np.sin(theta / 2)],\n            [1j * np.exp(1j * phi) * np.sin(theta / 2), np.cos(theta / 2)]\n        ], dtype=complex)\n\n    # The Nash Equilibrium strategy in the quantum game is Q = U(pi/2, 0)\n    theta_eq = np.pi / 2\n    phi_eq = 0.0\n\n    U_A = U(theta_eq, phi_eq)\n    U_B = U(theta_eq, phi_eq)\n\n    # Initial state is |CC> or |00>\n    psi_initial = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0], dtype=complex)\n\n    # The full evolution operator\n    # Note: The standard protocol applies J, then strategies, then J_H\n    full_evolution = J_H @ np.kron(U_A, U_B) @ J\n\n    # Calculate the final state\n    psi_final = full_evolution @ psi_initial\n\n    # Basis states for measurement\n    C00 = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0], dtype=complex) # Cooperate, Cooperate\n    C01 = np.array([0, 1, 0, 0], dtype=complex) # Cooperate, Defect\n    C10 = np.array([0, 0, 1, 0], dtype=complex) # Defect, Cooperate\n    C11 = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1], dtype=complex) # Defect, Defect\n\n    # Calculate probabilities of each outcome\n    P_cc = np.abs(np.vdot(C00, psi_final))**2\n    P_cd = np.abs(np.vdot(C01, psi_final))**2\n    P_dc = np.abs(np.vdot(C10, psi_final))**2\n    P_dd = np.abs(np.vdot(C11, psi_final))**2\n\n    # Calculate the payoffs for each player\n    payoff_A = R * P_cc + S * P_cd + T * P_dc + P * P_dd\n    payoff_B = R * P_cc + T * P_cd + S * P_dc + P * P_dd\n\n    print(\"Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma Equilibrium Calculation\")\n    print(\"================================================\")\n    print(f\"The Nash Equilibrium strategy is Q = U(theta=pi/2, phi=0).\")\n    print(f\"When both players choose Q, the outcome probabilities are:\")\n    print(f\"P(Cooperate, Cooperate) = {P_cc:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"P(Cooperate, Defect)   = {P_cd:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"P(Defect, Cooperate)   = {P_dc:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"P(Defect, Defect)     = {P_dd:.4f}\")\n    print(\"\\nPlayer A's equilibrium payoff is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"Payoff_A = (R * P_cc) + (S * P_cd) + (T * P_dc) + (P * P_dd)\")\n    print(f\"Payoff_A = ({R} * {P_cc:.2f}) + ({S} * {P_cd:.2f}) + ({T} * {P_dc:.2f}) + ({P} * {P_dd:.2f}) = {payoff_A:.2f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nPlayer B's equilibrium payoff is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"Payoff_B = (R * P_cc) + (T * P_cd) + (S * P_dc) + (P * P_dd)\")\n    print(f\"Payoff_B = ({R} * {P_cc:.2f}) + ({T} * {P_cd:.2f}) + ({S} * {P_dc:.2f}) + ({P} * {P_dd:.2f}) = {payoff_B:.2f}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe equilibrium point results in a payoff of {payoff_A:.2f} for each player.\")\n\nsolve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma()\n```\n<<<3.25>>>"
