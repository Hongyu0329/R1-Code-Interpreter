    This function solves for the smallest possible number of complements a non-trivial,
    non-discrete topology on a set of cardinality c can have.

    The problem is a known question in general topology.
    Let T be a topology on a set X. A topology S on X is a complement to T if:
    1. The topology generated by T U S is the discrete topology.
    2. The intersection T & S is the trivial topology ({emptyset, X}).

    The question is to find the minimum size of the set of all complements for a given T,
    minimized over all possible choices of T on a set X with |X| = c.

    - It can be shown that some topologies have a very large number of complements (2^(2^c)).
    - It is a result from advanced topology (Alas, Tkaƒçenko, Tkachuk, Wilson, 2005)
      that there exists a topology on a set of size c that has exactly 2 complements.
    - The existence of a topology with exactly 1 complement is a major open problem.

    Therefore, the smallest known possible number of complements is 2.
