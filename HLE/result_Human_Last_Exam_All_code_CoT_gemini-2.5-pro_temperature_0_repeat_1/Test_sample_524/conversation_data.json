    "This is a classic problem in point-set topology. The solution is not found by a direct computation but by citing a well-established mathematical theorem.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the terms:** I will first clarify what a \"homogeneous planar continuum\" is.\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Planar** means it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane (ℝ²).\n    *   **Homogeneous** means that for any two points in the space, there is a homeomorphism (a continuous, invertible map with a continuous inverse) of the space onto itself that maps the first point to the second. Essentially, the space looks the same from every point.\n2.  **State the theorem:** The classification of homogeneous planar continua is a famous result in topology, primarily due to the work of R. H. Bing. The theorem states that any such continuum must be homeomorphic to one of a very small number of specific spaces.\n3.  **List the classes:** I will list the distinct homeomorphism classes identified by the theorem.\n4.  **Write the code:** The Python code will enumerate these known classes and print the total count to answer the question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua\n    based on a known theorem in topology.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to a theorem by R.
