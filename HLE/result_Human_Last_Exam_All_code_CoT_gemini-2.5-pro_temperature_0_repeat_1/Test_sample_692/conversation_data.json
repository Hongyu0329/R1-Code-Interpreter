    "I will provide the answer by creating a Python script that stores the relevant information in variables and then prints a descriptive sentence. This approach allows me to present the data clearly and adhere to the format requirements.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the earliest recorded date from archaeological evidence. Research indicates this is the \"1 Earthquake\" glyph from the Zapotec civilization.\n2.  Gather key details: the location (San José Mogote), the monument (Monument 3), the civilization (Zapotec), and the approximate year (c. 600 BCE).\n3.  Write a Python script that assigns these details to variables.\n4.  Use the `print()` function to combine these variables into a coherent sentence that answers the user's question, making sure to output the numbers involved in the date (\"1\" and \"600\").\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the earliest known recorded date\n    by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    civilization = \"Zapotec\"\n    site = \"San José Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico\"\n    monument = \"Monument 3\"\n    date_glyph_day_number = 1\n    date_glyph_name = \"Earthquake\"\n    approximate_year_bce = 600\n\n    print(f\"The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is found on {monument} at the {civilization} site of {site}.\")\n    print(f\"The inscription, dated to approximately {approximate_year_bce} BCE, is a glyph representing the calendrical name '{date_glyph_day_number} {date_glyph_name}'.\")\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is \"1 Earthquake\", found on Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico, and dated to approximately 600 BCE.>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
