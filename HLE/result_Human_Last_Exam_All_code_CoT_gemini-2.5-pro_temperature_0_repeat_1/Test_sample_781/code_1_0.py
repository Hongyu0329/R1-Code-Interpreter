def solve_continuum_decomposition():
    """
    Solves the mathematical problem about the decomposition of a metric continuum.

    The problem states that X is a metric continuum with five distinct points
    P = {a, b, c, d, e}, such that no proper subcontinuum of X contains any
    three of these points. We want to find the largest number n for which we can
    write X = A_1 U ... U A_n, where each A_i is a subcontinuum and each A_i
    has a part not covered by the others (an irreducible decomposition).

    Step 1: Analyze the subcontinua A_i.
    A subcontinuum A_i in the decomposition cannot be equal to X itself. If it were,
    say A_1 = X, then for any other A_k (k != 1), the set A_k \ (U_{j!=k} A_j)
    would be empty because the union includes X. This contradicts the condition that
    this "private part" must be non-empty.
    Therefore, every A_i must be a proper subcontinuum of X.

    Step 2: Relate A_i to the set of points P.
    The problem states that no proper subcontinuum contains any three of the points
    from P. Since every A_i is a proper subcontinuum, each A_i can contain at most
    two points from P.

    Step 3: Establish an upper bound for n.
    Let's assume n is greater than the number of ways to choose 2 points from the 5
    points, which is C(5, 2) = 10.
    If n > 10, then by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of the subcontinua,
    say A_1, must be associated with a set of points from P of size less than 2
    (i.e., it contains one or zero points from P).
    This means we can find a set of three points S = {p1, p2, p3} from P that are
    all outside of A_1.
    By the given condition, the smallest continuum containing S, denoted C(S), is X itself.
    So, X = C(S).
    Since S is a subset of (X \ A_1), it follows that X = C(S) is a subset of C(X \ A_1).
    Let U_1 be the non-empty "private part" of A_1. Let x be a point in U_1.
    The set X \ {x} contains X \ A_1, so C(X \ A_1) is a subset of C(X \ {x}).
    Combining these facts, we get X is a subset of C(X \ {x}).
    It is a known theorem that a continuum like X has uncountably many non-cut points.
    The set U_1 is also uncountable, so we can choose x to be a non-cut point of X.
    For a non-cut point x, the set X \ {x} is a continuum, so C(X \ {x}) = X \ {x}.
    The inclusion becomes X is a subset of X \ {x}, which is a contradiction.
    Thus, our assumption that n > 10 must be false. So, n <= 10.

    Step 4: Conclude the largest value of n.
    It is a known result in continuum theory that for a space X with the given
    properties, a decomposition into n=10 subcontinua is possible, where each
    subcontinuum corresponds to an irreducible continuum between a pair of the
    five points.
    Therefore, the largest possible value for n is 10.
