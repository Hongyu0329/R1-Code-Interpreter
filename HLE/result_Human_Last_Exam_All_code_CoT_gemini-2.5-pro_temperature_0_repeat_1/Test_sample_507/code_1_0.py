    explanation = """
Two languages from two distinct Asian cultures with no direct contact that share surprisingly similar words for "mom," "dad," and "broom" are Korean and Persian (Farsi).

These languages belong to unrelated families (Koreanic and Indo-European) and are separated by thousands of miles. The similarities are likely a combination of linguistic coincidence and the universal nature of parental terms.

Here is the comparison:

1. Mom
   - Korean: eomma (엄마)
   - Persian: māmān (مامان)
   (Both derive from the simple, labial 'ma' sound that is one of the first sounds infants make.)

2. Dad
   - Korean: appa (아빠)
   - Persian: bābā (بابا)
   (Similar to 'mom', both words use simple, repeated labial consonants like 'p' and 'b'.)

3. Broom
   - Korean: bit-jaru (빗자루)
   - Persian: jâru (جارو)
   (The Korean word is a compound, but its 'jaru' component is phonetically very similar to the complete Persian word 'jâru'. This is considered a remarkable linguistic coincidence.)
