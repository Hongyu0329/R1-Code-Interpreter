    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function $Z$ for a system is given by a functional integral over all possible field configurations $\\phi$. For a neutral scalar field, this is written as $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$, where $S_E$ is the Euclidean action.\n\nThe Euclidean action is defined on a spacetime where the time coordinate is imaginary, $\\tau = it$, and is periodic with period $\\beta = 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature. The action can be split into a free (quadratic) part and an interacting part. The free part of the action for a neutral scalar field with mass $m$ is:\n\n$S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nUsing integration by parts, this can be rewritten into the form $\\frac{1}{2} \\int \\phi D \\phi$, which defines the operator $D$. This form allows us to identify the inner product you're asking about. The operator $D$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, $D = (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2)$.\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is therefore given by the integral of $\\phi$ multiplied by the result of applying this operator $D$ to $\\phi$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to symbolically construct and display this inner product for a scalar field in 3+1 dimensions.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically constructs the inner product (φ, Dφ)\n    for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
