    "Of course, I can help with that. The task is to compute the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix. The information about the \"Markov quiver\" is context, but the core of the task is the determinant calculation for the matrix `A` you've provided.\n\nMy plan is to use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n`det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n\nI will provide a Python script that:\n1.  Defines the matrix `A`.\n2.  Substitutes the elements of `A` into the formula.\n3.  Prints the step-by-step calculation.\n4.  Displays the final equation with all the numbers, as you requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem asks to compute the determinant of the adjacency matrix A.\n# The matrix is given as:\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# We can compute the determinant using the formula for a 3x3 matrix:\n# det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n# where the matrix is:\n# [[a, b, c],\n#  [d, e, f],\n#  [g, h, i]]\n\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the determinant\ndeterminant = a * (e * i - f * h) - b * (d * i - f * g) + c * (d * h - e * g)\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(\"The determinant calculation is as follows:\")\nprint(f\"{a} * (({e} * {i}) - ({f} * {h})) - ({b}) * (({d} * {i}) - ({f} * {g})) + ({c}) * (({d} * {h}) - ({e} * {g}))\")\nprint(f\"= {a} * ({e * i} - {f * h}) - ({b}) * ({d * i} - {f * g}) + ({c}) * ({d * h} - {e * g})\")\nprint(f\"= {a} * ({e * i - f * h}) - ({b}) * ({d * i - f * g}) + ({c}) * ({d * h - e * g})\")\nprint(f\"= {a * (e * i - f * h)} - ({b * (d * i - f * g)}) + ({c * (d * h - e * g)})\")\nprint(f\"= {a * (e * i - f * h) + (-1) * b * (d * i - f * g) + c * (d * h - e * g)}\")\nprint(f\"= {determinant}\")\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"
