    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Read the Input:** The input is a single string representing the sum, for example, `3+2+1+4+2`.\n2.  **Extract the Numbers:** The numbers in the sum are separated by the `+` character. I will split the input string by `+` to get a list of the individual numbers (as strings). For `3+2+1+4+2`, this will result in the list `['3', '2', '1', '4', '2']`.\n3.  **Sort the Numbers:** I will sort this list of numbers. Since the numbers are all single digits, a standard lexicographical sort will correctly order them numerically. The sorted list will be `['1', '2', '2', '3', '4']`.\n4.  **Reconstruct the Sum:** I will join the elements of the sorted list back into a single string, with `+` as the separator. This will produce the final string `1+2+2+3+4`.\n5.  **Print the Result:** Finally, I will print the newly constructed string, which represents the sum that Xenia can calculate.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\n# Read the input sum as a string\ns = input()\n\n# Split the string by the '+' character to get a list of numbers\nnumbers = s.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of numbers. Since they are single-digit strings,\n# default string sorting works correctly.\nnumbers.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted numbers back into a string with '+' as the separator\nsorted_sum = '+'.join(numbers)\n\n# Print the final rearranged sum\nprint(sorted_sum)\n```\n\nRegarding your question about the most memory-efficient C program and its memory usage:\n\nTo achieve maximum memory efficiency in C, one would avoid storing the entire input string (which could be up to 1000 characters). Instead, the program would read the input character by character and simply count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the memory required for the variables in such a C program, assuming an `int` is 4 bytes:\n1.  An integer array to store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4: `int counts[4];` -> `4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n2.  A variable to read each character from the input stream: `int c;` -> `4` bytes.\n3.  Loop counters for iterating and printing: `int i, j;` -> `2 * 4 = 8` bytes.\n4.  A flag to manage printing the `+` sign correctly: `int first;` -> `4` bytes.\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables would be the sum of these: `16 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 32` bytes.\n\n<<<32>>>"
