# This problem analyzes the connectivity of a topological space after removing a key point.
# The space consists of a primary line segment (L) and an infinite series of segments (L_n).
# All segments are initially connected at the origin (0,0).

# When the origin is removed, each segment becomes a distinct, separate connected component.
# We count the number of these components.

# 1. The component from the primary segment L.
num_L_components = 1

# 2. The components from the infinite series of segments L_n (for n=1, 2, 3, ...).
# The number of these components is equal to the number of positive integers, which is infinite.

# The total number of components can be represented by the conceptual equation:
# Total = (components from L) + (components from L_n)
# Total = 1 + infinity

# The final answer is therefore infinite.
print(f"The total number of connected components is infinite.")
print(f"This is derived from the conceptual equation: {num_L_components} + infinity, where {num_L_components} is the component from segment L.")
