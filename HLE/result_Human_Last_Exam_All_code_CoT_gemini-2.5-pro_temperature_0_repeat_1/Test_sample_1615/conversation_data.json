    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, with the condition that $G$ is not a complete graph. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for such a graph.\n\n2.  **Recall Basic Graph Theory Principles:**\n    *   For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is always less than or equal to $n$.\n    *   The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph ($K_n$), where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions:**\n    *   The number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph $G$ is explicitly stated to be *not* a complete graph.\n\n4.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   Since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$.\n    *   This gives us a firm upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n - 1$.\n    *   For this problem, the maximum number of colors is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n5.  **Prove the Upper Bound is Achievable:**\n    *   To confirm that $12344$ is the maximum possible value, we must show that there exists at least one graph $G$ (with $12345$ vertices and not complete) for which $\\chi(G) = 12344$.\n    *   Consider a graph constructed by taking a complete subgraph on $12344$ vertices (a $K_{12344}$) and adding one more vertex that is isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n    *   This graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n    *   The chromatic number of this graph is determined by its largest complete subgraph (clique). The $K_{12344}$ component requires $12344$ colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of those colors. Thus, the chromatic number for the entire graph is $12344$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the number of colors must be less than $12345$ and we have constructed a valid graph that requires $12344$ colors, the maximum number of colors is $12344$.\n\n7.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will perform the simple calculation ($n - 1$) and print an explanation of the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph\n    with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n    \n    # For any graph with n vertices, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most n.\n    # The equality chi(G) = n holds if and only if G is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # The problem states that G is not a complete graph.\n    # Therefore, the chromatic number of G must be strictly less than n.\n    # This means chi(G) <= n - 1.\n    \n    # To show this is the maximum, we must show it's achievable.\n    # Consider a graph formed by a complete subgraph on (n-1) vertices (a K_{n-1})\n    # and one additional isolated vertex. This graph has n vertices, is not complete,\n    # and its chromatic number is n-1.\n    \n    # Therefore, the maximum number of colors is n - 1.\n    max_colors = n - 1\n    \n    print(f\"Let n be the number of vertices in the graph G.
