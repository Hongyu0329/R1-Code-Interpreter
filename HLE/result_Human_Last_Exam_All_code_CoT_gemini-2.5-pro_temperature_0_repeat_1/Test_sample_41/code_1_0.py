# The number in the dataset that has the greatest negative impact on tornadogenesis is the
# Sfc-3km AGL Lapse Rate.
# A value of 5.7 C/km indicates a relatively stable low-level atmosphere.
# This stability directly inhibits the rapid vertical stretching of air parcels near the ground,
# a process that is crucial for concentrating rotation and forming a tornado.
# Even with extreme wind shear, this lack of low-level instability is a fundamental roadblock.
