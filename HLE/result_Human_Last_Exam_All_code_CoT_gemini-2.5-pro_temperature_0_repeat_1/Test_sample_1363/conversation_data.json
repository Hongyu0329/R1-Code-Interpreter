    "This is a question about the fundamental techniques of the five International Standard ballroom dances. I will analyze the core characteristics of each dance to determine which one's technique is incompatible with overturning a reverse turn.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define \"Overturning a Reverse Turn\":** This means turning more to the left than the standard syllabus figure prescribes, typically by using body swing and momentum.\n2.  **Analyze the \"Swing Dances\":** The English Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep are all \"swing dances.\" Their technique is fundamentally based on creating momentum, swing, sway, and using rise and fall to travel and rotate. In these dances, overturning a turn is an advanced skill that uses an extension of the core technique, not a violation of it.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Non-Swing Dance\":** The European Tango is unique. Its core technique is based on a staccato, \"walking\" action with no rise and fall, no body swing, and no sway. Turns are executed with sharp swivels and precise foot placements, not with continuous rotational momentum.\n4.  **Conclusion:** To overturn a reverse turn, a dancer needs to generate continuous rotational momentum (swing). Introducing swing into a Tango figure is a direct violation of its fundamental technique. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in Tango *without disregarding the technique*.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that prints this reasoning and then identifies the correct answer from the provided choices.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the technical characteristics of ballroom dances to answer the question.\n    \"\"\"\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe key to this question lies in the difference between \"swing\" and \"non-swing\" dances.\n\n1.  The English Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep are all swing dances. Their technique is built on generating momentum, body swing, and sway to create movement and rotation. In these dances, overturning a figure is an advanced application of this core technique. It uses more swing and momentum, but it doesn't violate the dance's principles.\n\n2.  The European Tango is fundamentally different. It is a \"non-swing\" dance characterized by a staccato action, no rise and fall, and a complete lack of body swing. Turns are sharp and created by swiveling, not by continuous rotation.\n\n3.  To \"overturn\" a reverse turn, a dancer must generate continuous rotational momentum, which is the definition of swing. Introducing swing into the Tango is a direct contradiction and disregard for its core technique.\n\nTherefore, the European Tango is the dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\"\"\"\n\n    correct_answer_key = 'C'\n    correct_answer_value = choices[correct_answer_key]\n\n    print(\"Thinking Process and Explanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"Final Answer Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"The correct choice is {correct_answer_key}, which corresponds to the dance: {correct_answer_value}.\")\n\nsolve_dance_technique_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
