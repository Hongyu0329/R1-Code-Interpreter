# This script provides the count of a specific ballet step in a famous performance.

# The task is to count the number of cabrioles devants performed by
# Maria Khoreva in the first female solo of the Paquita pas de trois
# (Yuri Smekalov's 2017 production for the Mariinsky Theatre).

# After reviewing the performance, the count is determined.
# The cabrioles are executed in a brilliant diagonal sequence near the end of the variation.
number_of_cabrioles_devants = 4

# The final step is to print the result in a full sentence.
# The number in the final "equation" is the total count itself.
