For Question 1 ('What animal's coat color changed as a baby?'):
- Document 1 states the change happened 'at a few months old'.
- Document 2 states the change happened 'As they reached puberty'.
- The phrase 'at a few months old' is more semantically related to 'as a baby' than 'puberty' is.
- Therefore, Document 1 is the more relevant document for Question 1.
"""

    # Analysis for Question 2: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
    q2_analysis = """
For Question 2 ('What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?'):
- Both Document 1 and Document 2 contain the identical sentence: 'Cows retained the reddish-brown colour.'
- Since the relevant information is identical, both documents are equally relevant for Question 2.
"""

Conclusion:
- The ranking for Question 1 is '1'.
- The ranking for Question 2 is '1' (as it is equally relevant to '2').
- This corresponds to the combined ranking '1-1'.
