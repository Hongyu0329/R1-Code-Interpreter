    "The problem asks for the Hopf charge of a given 3D vector field `n=(nx,ny,nz)`. The Hopf charge is a topological invariant, an integer `Q`, which characterizes how the vector field wraps space.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Hopf Charge**: The Hopf charge `Q` can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the target space of the vector field, which is the unit sphere S².\n2.  **Find Preimage Curves**: I will choose two convenient points on the sphere S² and find their corresponding preimages in the 3D space (x,y,z).\n    *   **Point 1 (South Pole)**: `p_S = (0, 0, -1)`. Its preimage is the set of all (x,y,z) for which `n(x,y,z) = p_S`. I will call this curve `C_S`.\n    *   **Point 2 (Equatorial Point)**: `p_E = (1, 0, 0)`. Its preimage is a curve `C_E`.\n3.  **Calculate the Linking Number**: The Hopf charge `Q` will be the linking number `Lk(C_S, C_E)`. I will calculate this by using the \"surface intersection\" method:\n    *   Define a simple surface `D_S` that has the curve `C_S` as its boundary.\n    *   Count the number of times the other curve, `C_E`, pierces this surface `D_S`. This count (with signs) gives the linking number.\n4.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to perform the necessary calculations to find the intersection points and determine if they lie on the surface `D_S`, thereby confirming the magnitude of the linking number. The sign of the charge is determined by the orientation of the field, which for this standard configuration is `+1`.\n\nThis process will allow us to determine the integer value of the Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field by finding the\n    linking number of the preimages of two points on the S^2 sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Hopf charge is the linking number Lk(C_S, C_E), where C_S and C_E\n    # are the preimages of two points on the sphere S^2.\n\n    # Step 1: Find the preimage of the South Pole, p_S = (0, 0, -1).\n    # The condition n = p_S gives nz = cos(G) = -1, which means G = PI.\n    # From the definition G = PI * exp(-10 * r2), G = PI implies r2 = 0.\n    # The condition r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 + z*z) = 0 implies:\n    # z = 0 and x^2 + y^2 - 0.5 = 0.\n    # So, the preimage C_S is the circle x^2 + y^2 = 0.5 in the z=0 plane.\n    radius_sq_CS = 0.5\n    print(\"Step 1: Finding the preimage of the South Pole (0,0,-1)\")\n    print(f\"The preimage curve C_S is a circle in the z=0 plane with equation x^2 + y^2 = {radius_sq_CS}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find the preimage of an equatorial point, p_E = (1, 0, 0).\n    # The condition n = p_E gives:\n    # nz = cos(G) = 0  => G = PI/2\n    # ny = sin(G)*sin(f) = 0 => sin(f) = 0 (since sin(G)=1) => y = 0\n    # nx = sin(G)*cos(f) = 1 => cos(f) = 1 (since sin(G)=1) => f = 0 (so x > 0)\n    # From G = PI/2, we find the value of r2:\n    # PI * exp(-10 * r2) = PI/2  =>  exp(-10 * r2) = 0.5  => r2 = ln(2)/10\n    # The preimage curve C_E is defined by r2^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2 with y=0, x>0:\n    # (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2\n    R = np.log(2) / 10\n    print(\"Step 2: Finding the preimage of the equatorial point (1,0,0)\")\n    print(f\"The preimage curve C_E is a loop in the y=0 plane with equation (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = R^2, where R = ln(2)/10 ≈ {R:.4f}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the linking number by counting intersections.\n    # We define a surface D_S bounded by C_S, which is the disk: x^2 + y^2 <= 0.5, z=0.\n    # We find the intersection points of C_E with the plane z=0.\n    # Setting z=0 in the equation for C_E: (x^2 - 0.5)^2 = R^2\n    # This gives x^2 - 0.5 = +/- R, so x^2 = 0.5 +/- R.\n    x_sq_1 = 0.5 - R\n    x_sq_2 = 0.5 + R\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculating the linking number Lk(C_S, C_E)\")\n    print(\"We count the intersections of curve C_E with the disk D_S (x^2+y^2 <= 0.5, z=0).\")\n    print(f\"The intersections of C_E with the z=0 plane occur at x^2 = 0.5 +/- R.\")\n    print(f\"Intersection 1: x^2 = 0.5 - {R:.4f} = {x_sq_1:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Intersection 2: x^2 = 0.5 + {R:.4f} = {x_sq_2:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # Check which intersection points lie inside the disk D_S (where x^2 <= 0.5).\n    is_inside_1 = x_sq_1 < radius_sq_CS\n    is_inside_2 = x_sq_2 < radius_sq_CS\n    print(\"Checking which intersection points are inside the disk D_S:\")\n    print(f\"Point 1 (x^2={x_sq_1:.4f}) is inside the disk (x^2 < {radius_sq_CS}): {is_inside_1}\")\n    print(f\"Point 2 (x^2={x_sq_2:.4f}) is inside the disk (x^2 < {radius_sq_CS}): {is_inside_2}\\n\")\n\n    num_intersections = int(is_inside_1) + int(is_inside_2)\n\n    print(f\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"There is exactly {num_intersections} intersection of C_E with the disk D_S.\")\n    print(\"This means the magnitude of the linking number is 1.\")\n    print(\"The given vector field describes a standard hopfion configuration, for which the Hopf charge is positive.\")\n    print(\"Final Equation: Hopf Charge = 1\")\n\nsolve_hopf_charge()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
