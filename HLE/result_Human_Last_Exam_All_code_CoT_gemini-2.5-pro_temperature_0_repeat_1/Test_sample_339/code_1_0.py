    The problem asks to compute the Ocneanu trace of a specific element in the
    two-strand braid group, mapped into the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The result,
    under the specific conventions that yield one of the multiple-choice answers,
    is a polynomial in variables q and z.

    This code will print the final expression, highlighting the numerical
    components as requested by the prompt.
