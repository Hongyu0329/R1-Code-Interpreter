    print("\nB. Gabapentin:")
    print("   - Treats pain, sleep issues, and RLS, but is less effective for the primary mood symptoms (anxiety/depression).")

    print("   - Treats pain and mood symptoms, but is less targeted for restless leg syndrome and sleep architecture issues than Gabapentin.")
    print("   - Verdict: Good, but may not fully address all of the patient's specific complaints.")

    # Option D: Cyclobenzaprine
    print("\nD. Cyclobenzaprine:")
    print("   - A muscle relaxant used for sleep. Not a primary agent for the full syndrome (pain, mood, cognitive issues).")

    print("   - Acetaminophen is a weak analgesic, likely less effective than the Ibuprofen the patient already takes.")
