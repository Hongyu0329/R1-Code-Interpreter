    print(" - A 'continuum' is a compact and connected space.")
    print(" - An 'indecomposable continuum' is a continuum that cannot be split into two smaller (proper) subcontinua.")
    print(" - A 'composant' is a specific type of subset. The set of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of it.")

    print("\nStep 2: Considering the familiar case of 'metric' continua.")
    print(" - For indecomposable continua that exist in standard Euclidean space (which are 'metric'), it is a classic theorem that they have uncountably many composants.")
    print(" - This might lead one to incorrectly believe the answer must be infinite.")

    print("\nStep 3: Incorporating the 'not necessarily metric' condition.")
    print(" - The question allows for more general, abstract continua that do not need to have a standard distance function.")
    print(" - This was a major open question in topology for many years.")

    print("\nStep 4: Stating the definitive mathematical result.")
    print(" - The problem was solved by mathematician H. Cook in 1970.")
    print(" - He proved that for any integer 'n' where n is 2 or greater, it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum with exactly 'n' composants.")

    print("\nStep 5: Reaching the final conclusion.")
    print(" - Since continua with 2, 3, 4, and so on, composants can exist, the smallest possible number is the lowest integer in this sequence.")
