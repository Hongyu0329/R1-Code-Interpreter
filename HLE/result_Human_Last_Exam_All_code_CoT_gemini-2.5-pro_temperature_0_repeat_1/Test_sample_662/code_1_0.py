# Step 1: Define the given parameters from the problem description.
R0 = 3.0  # Basic reproduction number
breakthrough_rate = 0.06  # 6% of vaccinated people get infected

# Step 2: Calculate the vaccine's real-world effectiveness (v_e).
# This is the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are protected from infection.
vaccine_effectiveness = 1 - breakthrough_rate

# Step 3: Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (p_c) needed for herd immunity.
# The formula adjusts the classic herd immunity threshold (1 - 1/R0)
# by the vaccine's effectiveness.
critical_coverage_proportion = (1 - 1/R0) / vaccine_effectiveness

# Convert the proportion to a percentage for the final answer.
critical_coverage_percentage = critical_coverage_proportion * 100

# Step 4: Print the explanation and the final result, including the equation.
print("To prevent the epidemic, we must reach the herd immunity threshold.")
print("This requires calculating the critical vaccination coverage (p_c) using the following formula:")
