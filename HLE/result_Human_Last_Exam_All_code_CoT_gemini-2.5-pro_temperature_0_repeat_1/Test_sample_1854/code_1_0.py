# The problem reduces to finding the sharpest exponent c in the inequality:
# ||T||^2 <= C * R^(2c)
# where ||T|| is the operator norm.

# By constructing a worst-case example using two transverse parabolas,
# we found that the operator norm squared scales with R:
# ||T||^2 is approximately proportional to R^1.

# To find the smallest possible c, we equate the exponents of R.
# Let lhs_exponent be the exponent from our analysis, and rhs_exponent be from the problem statement.
lhs_exponent = 1
# The expression for the exponent on the right-hand side is 2*c.
c = sympy.Symbol('c')
rhs_exponent = 2 * c

# We set up the equation: rhs_exponent = lhs_exponent
equation = sympy.Eq(rhs_exponent, lhs_exponent)

# Solve the equation for c
solution = sympy.solve(equation, c)

# Output the result
print("The relationship between the exponents is:")
# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
# The equation is 2 * c = 1.
