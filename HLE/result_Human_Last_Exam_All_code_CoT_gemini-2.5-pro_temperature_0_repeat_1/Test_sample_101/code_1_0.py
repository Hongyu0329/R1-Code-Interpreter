    explanation = """
The question asks which type of student is most likely to experience a significant long-term impact on interest development from receiving concrete feedback with immediate next steps. Let's analyze this using Hidi and Renninger's model:

1.  **Triggered Situational Interest:** At this initial stage, interest is fleeting and dependent on novel stimuli. While feedback might be helpful, the student's engagement is too fragile for it to have a lasting developmental impact.

2.  **Maintained Situational Interest:** Interest is sustained by external factors like a supportive environment or engaging tasks. Feedback is part of this support system, but the goal for long-term development is to shift the student's motivation from external to internal.

3.  **Emerging Individual Interest:** This is the critical transition phase. The student is beginning to see personal value in the topic but may lack the confidence or knowledge to proceed independently. Concrete, actionable feedback is precisely what this student needs. It builds their sense of competence, provides a clear path forward, and reinforces their decision to invest personally in the topic. This support is crucial for solidifying their interest and helping it become a stable, long-term individual interest.

4.  **Well-Developed Individual Interest:** This student is already self-motivated and has a deep, enduring interest. They can often generate their own next steps. Feedback is still valuable for learning, but it is less critical for the fundamental development of their interest, which is already robust.

Therefore, the feedback provides the most significant long-term developmental leverage for the student whose interest is emerging and needs to be solidified.
