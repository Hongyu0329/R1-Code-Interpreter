    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you need to identify and knock out the gene responsible for the first step in its native catabolic pathway.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the metabolic pathway:** *C. glutamicum* possesses a native degradation pathway for phenylpropanoids, including p-coumaric acid.\n2.  **Pinpoint the initial reaction:** The first step in this degradation pathway is the activation of p-coumaric acid into its CoA-thioester (p-coumaroyl-CoA). This is a common strategy in bacteria to prepare aromatic acids for further breakdown.\n3.  **Identify the responsible enzyme and gene:** This activation is catalyzed by a phenylpropanoid:CoA ligase. In the genome of *Corynebacterium glutamicum* ATCC 13032, the gene `cg2920` (also referred to as `phdC` in some literature) encodes a subunit of this critical enzyme.\n4.  **Determine the knockout strategy:** By knocking out the `cg2920` gene, you block the very first step of the degradation pathway. This prevents the cell from metabolizing the p-coumaric acid you are producing, leading to its accumulation.\n\nThe following Python script will print the name of the target gene for knockout.\n\n```python\ndef find_knockout_target_gene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the gene in Corynebacterium glutamicum to knock out\n    to prevent p-coumaric acid degradation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The degradation of p-coumaric acid in C. glutamicum is initiated by\n    # its activation to p-coumaroyl-CoA.\n    # This reaction is catalyzed by a phenylpropanoid:CoA ligase.\n    # A key gene encoding a subunit of this enzyme is cg2920 (also known as phdC).\n    # Knocking out this gene is a proven strategy to increase p-coumaric acid accumulation.\n    \n    target_gene = \"cg2920\"\n    gene_alias = \"phdC\"\n    \n    print(f\"To prevent p-coumaric acid degradation in Corynebacterium glutamicum, you should knock out the following gene:\")\n    print(f\"Gene Locus Tag: {target_gene}\")\n    print(f\"Gene Alias: {gene_alias}\")\n\nfind_knockout_target_gene()\n```\n<<<cg2920>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
