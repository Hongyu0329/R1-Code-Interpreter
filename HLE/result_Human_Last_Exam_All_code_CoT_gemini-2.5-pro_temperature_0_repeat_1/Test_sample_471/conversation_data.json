    "This problem can be solved using a fundamental result from Morse theory, which connects the topology of a manifold to the number of critical points of any smooth function defined on it.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Manifold:** The domain of the function is the 2-torus, $T^2$.\n2.  **Use Morse Theory:** Morse theory provides a powerful tool called the Morse inequalities. For any smooth function on a compact manifold, these inequalities give a lower bound on the number of critical points.\n3.  **Topological Invariants (Betti Numbers):** The inequalities use the Betti numbers ($b_k$) of the manifold. We will determine the Betti numbers for the 2-torus.\n    *   $b_0$: Number of connected components.\n    *   $b_1$: Number of one-dimensional \"holes\".\n    *   $b_2$: Number of two-dimensional \"voids\".\n4.  **Apply the Inequalities:** A key consequence of the Morse inequalities is that the total number of critical points ($C$) must be greater than or equal to the sum of the Betti numbers.\n    $C \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2$.\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** We will calculate the sum of the Betti numbers for the 2-torus to find the minimal number of critical points.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to derive the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_on_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    f: T^2 -> R using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: The problem is about a smooth function on a 2-torus (T^2).\n    # We use Morse theory to solve it.\n    print(\"To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus (T^2), we use Morse Theory.\")\n    print(\"This theory relates the number of critical points to the topology of the space via its Betti numbers.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the Betti numbers for the 2-torus.\n    # b_0 is the number of connected components.
