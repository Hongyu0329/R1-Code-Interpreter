    Solves the multipart question about stingray duos.
    
    (a) Is the pair (g_1, g_2) irreducible if g_1 and g_2 are (3, 2)-stingray elements?
    (b) If not, state which of the following cause the reducibility:
        - (1) F_1 \cap F_2 != {0}
        - (2) U_1 = F_2
        - (3) U_2 = F_1
    (c) Calculate the proportion of irreducible (3, 2)-stingray duos in G x G.

    # Part (a)
    # Let F_i = ker(g_i - 1) be the fixed-point space of g_i.
    # d=5, e1=3, e2=2.
    # dim(F1) = d - e1 = 5 - 3 = 2.
    # dim(F2) = d - e2 = 5 - 2 = 3.
    #
    # We consider two cases for the intersection of the fixed-point spaces F1 and F2.
    # Case 1: F1 \cap F2 is not the zero vector space.
    # In this case, the intersection is a non-trivial subspace where every vector is fixed by both g1 and g2.
    # This subspace is therefore invariant under the group <g1, g2>.
    # Since dim(F1 \cap F2) <= dim(F1) = 2 < 5, it is a proper invariant subspace.
    # Thus, the pair is reducible.
    #
    # Case 2: F1 \cap F2 = {0}.
    # Since dim(F1) + dim(F2) = 2 + 3 = 5 = d, this implies V = F1 \oplus F2.
    # In the decomposition V = F1 \oplus F2:
    # g1 fixes F1, so its matrix is of the form g1 = I \oplus D for some D in GL(F2).
    # g2 fixes F2, so its matrix is of the form g2 = P \oplus I for some P in GL(F1).
    # The group <g1, g2> is generated by these two block-diagonal matrices.
    # Any element in this group is of the form P^i \oplus D^j.
    # This group preserves the subspaces F1 and F2.
    # Since dim(F1)=2 and dim(F2)=3 are non-trivial, these are proper invariant subspaces.
    # Thus, the pair is reducible in this case as well.
    #
    # Since the pair is reducible in all cases, the answer to (a) is No.
    answer_a = "No"
    
    # Part (b)
    # The analysis for (a) shows that the pair is always reducible.
    # The reducibility is caused by either F1 \cap F2 != {0} (Condition 1)
    # or by the structure that arises when F1 \cap F2 = {0}.
    # In the case F1 \cap F2 = {0}, we have V = F1 \oplus F2, g1 = I \oplus D, g2 = P \oplus I.
    # U1 = im(g1 - 1) = im(0 \oplus (D-I)) = F2 (since D is irreducible, D-I is invertible).
    # U2 = im(g2 - 1) = im((P-I) \oplus 0) = F1 (since P is irreducible, P-I is invertible).
    # So, if condition (1) is false, conditions (2) and (3) must be true.
    # All three conditions are reasons for reducibility.
    answer_b = "{ (1), (2), (3) }"
    
    # Part (c)
    # Since every (3, 2)-stingray duo is reducible, the number of irreducible ones is 0.
    # The proportion is therefore 0.
    proportion = 0
