# The problem asks for the value, which is a complex number.

# However, the standard mathematical notation is requested.
# Let's output the expression as a string.
# The question asks for the answer content, not the code to generate it.
# The value is 226*pi*i
# Let's assume the format wants the symbolic expression.
# <<<226*pi*i>>>
# Let's check the prompt again. "directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>>"
# It does not say the python code should output it. I, the AI, should output it.
# The python code is part of the explanation.
# The final answer is the content for the <<<>>> block.
# The content is a value. 226*pi*i is a value.
# Let's check if a numerical value is expected. pi is irrational. i is imaginary.
# So a symbolic expression is the most precise form.
# The value is 226*pi*i.
# Let's write it as a complex number. 0 + (226*pi)i.
# The magnitude is 226*pi.
# 226 * 3.14159 = 710.0
# So the value is approximately 710i.
# The format does not specify numerical or symbolic.
# Let's stick to the symbolic form as it is exact.
# The prompt says "return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response"
# So I will add it at the very end.
# The python code block should be self-contained and do its job.
# The print statements in the python code are for the user's benefit to understand the result.
# The final answer is for the system to parse.
# The value is 226*pi*i.
# Let's check if I should use `*` or not.
# Let's write it as 226*pi*i.
# The problem is about complex analysis, so 'i' is standard.
# The value is a pure imaginary number.
# The calculation of 113 seems correct based on manual checks and the logic.
# The ellipse approximation gave 107, which is close, suggesting the shape is somewhat elliptical.
# The code is more accurate as it uses the exact polynomial.
# The number of poles is 113.
# 27 (n=0) + 2*25 (n=+-1) + 2*15 (n=+-2) + 2*3 (n=+-3) = 27 + 50 + 30 + 6 = 113.
# The code confirms this.
# So the answer is 226*pi*i.
