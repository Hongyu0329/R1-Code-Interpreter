    # Key facts derived from the text:
    # 1. CA biotype (watermelon-adapted) does well on a raffinose-rich diet.
    # 2. MA biotype (cotton-adapted) does well on a sucrose-only diet.
    # 3. This implies watermelon is raffinose-rich and cotton is sucrose-rich.
    # 4. Galactosidase is the enzyme needed to break down raffinose.

    # Analysis of Statement A
    print("Statement A: CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. The text states CA thrives on a diet rich in raffinose (an RFO), while MA thrives on a sucrose-only diet. This indicates a superior RFO metabolic capability in CA.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement B
    print("Statement B: CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. This is a direct summary of the information given in the first sentence of the text.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement C
    print("Statement C: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")
    print("Analysis: LIKELY TRUE. CA is moved from its raffinose-rich host (watermelon) to a raffinose-poor host (cotton). The enzyme for raffinose metabolism (galactosidase) would likely decrease in activity due to the lack of its substrate.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement D
    print("Statement D: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.")
    print("Analysis: LIKELY TRUE. Cotton is sucrose-rich, and sucrose contains glucose. In many organisms, high levels of glucose can inhibit the enzymes used to metabolize other, more complex sugars (a process called catabolite repression). This is a plausible biological reason for the decrease.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement E
    print("Statement E: Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.")
    print("Analysis: NOT TRUE. The MA biotype is described as a cotton-adapted sucrose specialist. This specialization implies it has a poor, not a flexible, ability to metabolize raffinose. It is highly unlikely that this specialist would be able to 'increase' its activity for a sugar it is not adapted to. This statement contradicts the fundamental premise of the MA biotype's adaptation.\n")

    print("Conclusion: Statement E is the one that is not true.")
