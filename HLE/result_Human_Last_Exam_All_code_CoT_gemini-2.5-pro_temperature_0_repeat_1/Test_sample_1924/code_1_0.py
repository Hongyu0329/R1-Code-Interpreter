    This function solves the geometry problem and prints the final equation.

    Problem:
    AB is a chord within circle O, and through a point M on AB, any two chords CD and EF are drawn.
    The circumcircles of ΔEMD and ΔCMF intersect the line AB at points G and H, respectively.
    Express MG - MH in terms of MA and MB.

    Reasoning:
    1. Let the main circle be O. Points A, B, C, D, E, F are on O.
    2. Let the circumcircle of ΔEMD be O1. It intersects line AB at M and G.
    3. Let the circumcircle of ΔCMF be O2. It intersects line AB at M and H.
    4. A key (but non-trivial) theorem in geometry, known as the "Double Power Theorem" or a consequence of Reim's Theorem, states that the power of point A with respect to circle O1 is equal to the power of point A with respect to circle O2.
    5. The power of point A with respect to O1 is given by the product of the signed distances from A to the intersection points of line AB with O1. This is Power_A(O1) = AM * AG.
    6. Similarly, the power of point A with respect to O2 is Power_A(O2) = AM * AH.
    7. According to the theorem, Power_A(O1) = Power_A(O2).
    8. Therefore, AM * AG = AM * AH.
    9. Since M is a point on the chord AB, A is distinct from M, so AM is not zero. We can divide both sides by AM.
    10. This gives AG = AH. Since G and H both lie on the line AB, this means G and H are the same point.
    11. If G and H are the same point, then their distances from M must be equal, so MG = MH.
    12. Consequently, the expression MG - MH must be equal to 0.

    # The result of the geometric derivation is that MG = MH.
    # Therefore, MG - MH = 0.
    # The problem asks to express this in terms of MA and MB.
    # The expression is simply the constant 0.
    
    mg_minus_mh_value = 0
    
    # We print the final equation, showing each number as requested.
