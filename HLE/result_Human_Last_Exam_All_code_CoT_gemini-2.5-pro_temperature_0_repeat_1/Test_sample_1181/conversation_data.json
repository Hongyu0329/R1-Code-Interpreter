    "To answer this question, I will identify the character from the 1972 film *Solaris* who made the specific statement about missing the sound of rustling leaves. My plan is to use a Python script to encapsulate this knowledge. The script will store the provided answer choices and then programmatically select and print the correct character's name and corresponding option based on the film's dialogue.\n\n```python\ndef find_solaris_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the character from the 1972 movie 'Solaris'\n    who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping the multiple-choice options to the character names.\n    characters = {\n        'A': 'Kris',\n        'B': 'Hari',\n        'C': 'Snaut',\n        'D': 'Sartorius',\n        'E': 'Gibarian'\n    }\n\n    # In the film, Dr. Snaut expresses his weariness and nostalgia for Earth\n    # to the main character, Kris Kelvin. He confesses his shame over\n    # being homesick for simple, earthly things.\n    correct_character_name = 'Snaut'\n\n    # Find the correct option letter corresponding to the character's name.\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, name in characters.items():\n        if name == correct_character_name:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    if correct_option:\n        print(f\"The character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth is Dr. {correct_character_name}.\")\n        print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice: {correct_option}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The correct character was not found in the options.\")\n\nfind_solaris_character()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
