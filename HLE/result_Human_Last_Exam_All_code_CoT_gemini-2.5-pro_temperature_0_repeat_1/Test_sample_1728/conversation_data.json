    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Understand the Graph Operation:** The \"sum\" of graphs in this context refers to the graph join operation. I will define the graph \\( G \\) as the join of three cycles of length \\( n \\), i.e., \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\).\n2.  **Use the Chromatic Number Formula for Joins:** There is a standard formula for the chromatic number of a graph join: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). I will extend this to the sum of three graphs.\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** Using the formula, the chromatic number of \\( G \\) will be \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n4.  **Analyze \\( \\chi(C_n) \\):** The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on its length \\( n \\). I will analyze the two cases: when \\( n \\) is even and when \\( n \\) is odd.\n5.  **Maximize the Result:** The problem asks for the *maximal* chromatic number. This means I need to choose the case for \\( n \\) (even or odd) that maximizes \\( \\chi(C_n) \\), and in turn, maximizes \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n6.  **Calculate and Conclude:** I will substitute the maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into the expression for \\( \\chi(G) \\) to find the final answer. The python script will print out this reasoning and the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the graph G and the 'sum' operation.\")\n    print(\"The graph G is the sum of three cycles of length n.
