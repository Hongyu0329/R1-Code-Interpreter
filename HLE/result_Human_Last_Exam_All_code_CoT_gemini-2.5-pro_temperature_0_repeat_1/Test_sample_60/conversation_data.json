    "My plan is to simulate each of the three Turing Machines on an empty tape and count the number of steps each one takes to reach the halt state 'H'.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Represent the Turing Machine:** I'll create a data structure, specifically a dictionary, to store the rules for each machine. The input strings like `B1L B0R...` will be parsed such that for each state (A, B, C, etc.), I'll know the next state, the symbol to write, and the direction to move for both possible inputs (0 or 1).\n2.  **Represent the Tape:** The Turing Machine tape is infinite. A dictionary in Python is a great way to model this, where keys are tape positions and values are the symbols (0 or 1). Using a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module will be convenient, as it automatically handles reading from an empty (0-valued) cell without needing to check if the key exists.\n3.  **Simulate the Execution:** For each machine, I will initialize the state to 'A', the tape head position to 0, and the step count to 0. I'll then run a loop that continues as long as the current state is not the halt state 'H'.\n4.  **Execution Loop:** In each step of the loop, I will:\n    a. Read the value from the tape at the current head position.\n    b. Look up the corresponding rule for the current state and the value read.\n    c. Update the tape by writing the new value.\n    d. Update the state to the new state.\n    e. Move the head left or right.\n    f. Increment the step counter.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** After running the simulation for all three machines, I will compare their total step counts. The machine with the highest step count is the answer. I will print the results for all machines and then identify the winner and its step count.\n\nThis approach will accurately determine which machine runs the longest and for how many steps.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef simulate_turing_machine(rule_string: str, max_steps: int = 100000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a Turing machine based on a rule string.\n\n    The rule string format is a concatenation of rules for states A, B, C, ...\n    Each state has two rules (for reading 0 and 1), each 3 characters long.\n    Example rule: 'B1L' means \"move to state B, write 1, move Left\".\n\n    Args:\n        rule_string: The string defining the machine's rules.\n        max_steps: A safeguard limit to prevent infinite loops.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of steps until the machine halts, or -1 if it exceeds max_steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parse the rule string into a more usable dictionary format\n    rules = {}\n    state_chars = \"ABCDEFGH\"\n    # Remove spaces for easier parsing\n    cleaned_rule_string = rule_string.replace(\" \", \"\")\n    \n    # Each state (A, B, C...) has two 3-character rules, making a 6-character block\n    rule_blocks = [cleaned_rule_string[i:i+6] for i in range(0, len(cleaned_rule_string), 6)]\n\n    for i, block in enumerate(rule_blocks):\n        current_state = state_chars[i]\n        rules[current_state] = {}\n        \n        # Rule for reading a 0\n        rule_for_0 = block[0:3]\n        next_state_0, write_val_0, move_0 = rule_for_0[0], int(rule_for_0[1]), rule_for_0[2]\n        rules[current_state][0] = (next_state_0, write_val_0, 1 if move_0 == 'R' else -1)\n        \n        # Rule for reading a 1\n        rule_for_1 = block[3:6]\n        next_state_1, write_val_1, move_1 = rule_for_1[0], int(rule_for_1[1]), rule_for_1[2]\n        rules[current_state][1] = (next_state_1, write_val_1, 1 if move_1 == 'R' else -1)\n\n    # Initialize the simulation\n    tape = collections.defaultdict(int)  # Tape is infinite and defaults to 0\n    state = 'A'\n    head_position = 0\n    steps = 0\n\n    # Run the simulation loop\n    while state != 'H':\n        if steps >= max_steps:\n            return -1  # Machine did not halt within the step limit\n\n        current_tape_value = tape[head_position]\n        \n        # Get the rule for the current state and tape value\n        next_state, value_to_write, move_direction = rules[state][current_tape_value]\n        \n        # Apply the rule\n        tape[head_position] = value_to_write\n        head_position += move_direction\n        state = next_state\n        steps += 1\n        \n    return steps\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to define, run, and compare the Turing machines.\n    \"\"\"\n    machines = [\n        \"B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L\",\n        \"B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R\",\n        \"B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R\"\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for i, machine_code in enumerate(machines):\n        num_steps = simulate_turing_machine(machine_code)\n        results.append((i + 1, num_steps))\n        if num_steps != -1:\n            print(f\"Machine {i + 1} halts after {num_steps} steps.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Machine {i + 1} did not halt within the step limit.\")\n\n    # Find the machine with the most steps\n    if not results:\n        print(\"\\nNo simulations were run.\")\n        return\n\n    # Filter out non-halting machines for comparison\n    halting_machines = [res for res in results if res[1] != -1]\n\n    if not halting_machines:\n        print(\"\\nNone of the machines halted within the step limit.\")\n        return\n\n    winner = max(halting_machines, key=lambda item: item[1])\n    winner_machine_number = winner[0]\n    winner_steps = winner[1]\n\n    print(f\"\\nMachine {winner_machine_number} halts after the most number of steps.\")\n    print(f\"The number of steps is: {winner_steps}\")\n    \n    # The final answer format as requested\n    print(f\"\\n<<<Machine {winner_machine_number}>>>\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<Machine 3>>>"
