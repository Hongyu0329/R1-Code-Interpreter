    This function calculates the number of different homeomorphism classes for the space X.

    The properties of the space X are:
    1. X is a metric space.
    2. For each pair of distinct points x, y in X, we have x in Int(K) which is a subset of X \ {y}
       for some closed connected set K in X. This implies X is locally connected.
    3. X is locally compact.
    4. X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line.

    Based on these properties, we can classify the topology of X by the behavior of the
    mapping function f: R -> X at its ends (t -> +/- infinity).

    The possible scenarios for the limits are:
    1. No limits exist in X: X is homeomorphic to the real line R. (1 class)
    2. One limit exists in X: X is homeomorphic to a "lariat" (a ray with a loop). (1 class)
    3. Both limits exist and are the same point in X: X is homeomorphic to a "figure-eight". (1 class)
    4. Both limits exist and are different points in X: X is homeomorphic to a "dumbbell". (1 class)

    These four classes are topologically distinct.
