    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the algorithm's time complexity, followed by a Python implementation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of Time Complexity\n\nThe goal is to find the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, which converts a number `n` into its base `c` representation.\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    The first step is `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`. This involves a fixed number of simple operations: three assignments, one integer division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. These operations take a constant amount of time. Therefore, the complexity of this step is **O(1)**.\n\n2.  **Loop Analysis (Step 2):**\n    The core of the algorithm is the `while q > 0` loop. The complexity of the algorithm is determined by how many times this loop executes.\n    *   Let's track the value of `q`. In each iteration, `x` is set to the current `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that in every iteration, the value of `q` is roughly divided by the base `c`.\n    *   The loop continues until `q` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is less than 1 is given by the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`, which is `log_c(n)`.\n    *   For example, if n=100 and c=10, `q` goes from 10 to 1 to 0, taking 2 iterations (`log_10(100) = 2`). If n=32 and c=2, `q` goes from 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, taking 5 iterations (`log_2(32) = 5`).\n    *   Therefore, the number of loop iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n3.  **Cost per Iteration:**\n    Inside the loop, the operations are `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`. Similar to the initialization step, these are all basic assignments and arithmetic operations. The cost of a single iteration is constant, i.e., **O(1)**.\n\n4.  **Total Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity is the product of the number of iterations and the cost per iteration.\n    *   Total Complexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration)\n    *   Total Complexity = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = **O(log_c(n))**\n\nIn Big O notation, the base of the logarithm is usually omitted because it only differs by a constant factor from any other base (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`), and constant factors are ignored. Thus, the complexity is commonly expressed as **O(log n)**.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nHere is a Python script that implements the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm and demonstrates its execution. To satisfy the instruction \"output each number in the final equation\", the code also prints the polynomial expansion of the number in the new base.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef imag_representation(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents a non-negative integer n in base c using the IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    It also prints the final representation and the corresponding polynomial equation.\n\n    Args:\n        n: An integer, where n >= 0.\n        c: An integer, where c >= 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate inputs\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        return\n    if not isinstance(c, int) or c < 2:\n        print(\"Error: c must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # Handle the special case of n = 0\n    if n == 0:\n        print(f\"The base-{c} representation of 0 is: (0)\")\n        print(\"The final equation is: 0 = 0 * {c}^0\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: Initialization\n    x = n\n    q = math.floor(x / c)\n    a0 = x - q * c\n    digits = [a0]\n\n    # Step 2: Loop while q > 0\n    while q > 0:\n        # Step 2.1\n        x = q\n        q = math.floor(x / c)\n        ai = x - q * c\n        digits.append(ai)\n\n    # The digits are generated from least significant to most significant.\n    # Reverse the list for the standard representation (most significant first).\n    digits.reverse()\n    \n    # Step 3: Output the results\n    representation_str = \"\".join(map(str, digits))\n    print(f\"The base-{c} representation of {n} is: ({representation_str})\")\n    \n    # Output the final equation showing each number\n    equation_parts = []\n    power = len(digits) - 1\n    for digit in digits:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{digit} * {c}^{power}\")\n        power -= 1\n    \n    print(f\"The final equation is: {n} = {' + '.join(equation_parts)}\")\n\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\n# Find the representation of n=25 in base c=2\n# The expected result is (11001) because 25 = 1*16 + 1*8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 1*1\nprint(\"--- Example 1: n=25, c=2 ---\")\nimag_representation(25, 2)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Example 2: n=255, c=16 ---\")\n# The expected result is (FF) because 255 = 15*16^1 + 15*16^0\n# The algorithm will produce digits [15, 15]\nimag_representation(255, 16)\n```\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
