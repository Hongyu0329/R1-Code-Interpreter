# The task is to find the sum of all entries in the Cartan matrix of the principal
# block of the group algebra kG, where G = A_5 x C_2 and char(k) = 2.

# Step 1: Define the Cartan matrix for the principal 2-block of A_5.
# This is a known result from the modular representation theory of finite groups.
# The principal block has two simple modules.

# For char(k)=2, kC_2 is a local algebra with one simple module. Its PIM has length 2.

# Step 3: The Cartan matrix of the principal block of G = A_5 x C_2 is the
# Kronecker product of the individual Cartan matrices.

# Step 4: Calculate the sum of all entries in the resulting matrix.
