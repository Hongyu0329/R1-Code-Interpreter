# The stable commutator length of a single commutator [a_i, b_i] in the free group F_i.
# This is a standard result in geometric group theory.
scl_of_single_commutator = 0.5

# The total stable commutator length is calculated by applying the properties of scl:
# scl(c) = scl(c_1^30 * ... * c_19^30)
#        = sum_{i=1 to 19} scl(c_i^30)      (by additivity over free products)
#        = sum_{i=1 to 19} 30 * scl(c_i)    (by homogeneity)
#        = sum_{i=1 to 19} 30 * 0.5         (substituting the known value)
#        = 19 * 30 * 0.5
result = num_terms * power * scl_of_single_commutator
