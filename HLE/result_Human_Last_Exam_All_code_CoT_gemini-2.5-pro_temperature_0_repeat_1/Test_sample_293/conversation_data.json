    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the integral, followed by a Python script to compute the final value.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Simplify the Summand**: The integral contains an infinite sum of logarithms. The first step is to simplify this sum. Using the property $\\log a + \\log b = \\log(ab)$, the sum can be converted into the logarithm of an infinite product:\n    $$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Infinite Product**: The infinite product $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}$ is a well-known identity. It can be evaluated by considering its partial product $P_N$ and using the sine double-angle formula, $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$, which implies $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2\\sin(\\theta)}$.\n    $$ P_N = \\prod_{n=1}^{N}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) \\cdots \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^N}\\right) $$\n    Applying the identity to each term creates a telescoping product:\n    $$ P_N = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{2\\sin(x/2)} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(x/2)}{2\\sin(x/4)} \\cdots \\frac{\\sin(x/2^{N-1})}{2\\sin(x/2^N)} = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{2^N\\sin(x/2^N)} $$\n    Taking the limit as $N \\to \\infty$, and using the fact that $\\lim_{u\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin u}{u} = 1$:\n    $$ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} P_N = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(x/2^N)}{x/2^N}} = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x \\cdot 1} = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\n\n3.  **Transform the Integral**: Substituting the result of the infinite product back into the original integral, we get:\n    $$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Final Integral**: This is a classic definite integral known as the Lobachevsky integral. While the proof is non-trivial and typically requires advanced techniques like complex analysis or differentiation under the integral sign, the result is a standard one in mathematical literature. The value of this integral is:\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation**: Finally, I will provide a Python script to compute the numerical value of $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The integral has been symbolically evaluated to -pi/2.\n# This script calculates its numerical value.\n\n# Define the components of the final expression\nsign_char = \"-\"\nnumerator_symbol = \"pi\"\ndenominator_value = 2\nnumerator_value = math.pi\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = -numerator_value / denominator_value\n\n# Output the final equation and its numerical value,\n# including each component as requested.\nprint(f\"The integral evaluates to the expression: {sign_char}{numerator_symbol} / {denominator_value}\")\nprint(f\"The components are:\")\nprint(f\"  - Sign: {sign_char}\")\nprint(f\"  - Numerator ({numerator_symbol}): {numerator_value}\")\nprint(f\"  - Denominator: {denominator_value}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final value of the integral is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<-1.5707963267948966>>>"
