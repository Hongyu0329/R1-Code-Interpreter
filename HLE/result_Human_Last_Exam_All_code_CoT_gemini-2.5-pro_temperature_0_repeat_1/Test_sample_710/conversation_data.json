    "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest integer `N` such that any integer `k >= N` can be written as a sum of distinct numbers from the set `S = {2n^2 + 3n + 1 | n >= 0}`. This is equivalent to finding the largest integer that *cannot* be represented as such a sum. If we call this largest unreachable number `M`, then `N = M + 1`.\n\nHere is my plan to find this number:\n\n1.  **Generate the numbers:** First, I'll generate the elements of the set `S`. The formula is `s_n = 2n^2 + 3n + 1`. The first few elements are 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, ...\n\n2.  **Use Dynamic Programming:** I'll use a dynamic programming approach to determine which numbers can be formed by a sum of distinct elements from `S`. I'll create a boolean array, let's call it `reachable`, of a sufficiently large size (e.g., up to 300). `reachable[i]` will be `True` if the number `i` can be formed, and `False` otherwise.\n\n3.  **Populate the `reachable` array:** I'll initialize `reachable[0]` to `True` (representing a sum of zero) and all other entries to `False`. Then, for each element `s` in my generated set `S`, I'll iterate through the `reachable` array. For each number `j`, if `j-s` is reachable, then `j` is also reachable by adding `s`. To ensure the elements are distinct, I'll iterate the `j` loop downwards.\n\n4.  **Find the largest unreachable number:** After populating the `reachable` array, I'll scan it from the end to find the largest index `i` for which `reachable[i]` is `False`. This will be our number `M`.\n\n5.  **Determine N:** The final answer `N` will be `M + 1`. I'll test with a sufficiently large limit to ensure the result is stable. A limit of 300 should be adequate, as it's much larger than the expected answer.\n\nThe instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is ambiguous. I will interpret it as a request to be clear about the final answer `N`. The code will calculate and print this value.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest number N such that any number >= N can be written\n    as a sum of distinct numbers of the form 2n^2 + 3n + 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a sufficiently large limit for our search space.\n    # A stable result for the largest unreachable number with a limit of 300\n    # gives high confidence in the answer.\n    MAX_LIMIT = 300\n\n    # 1.
