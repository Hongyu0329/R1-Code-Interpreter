    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core task is to find the maximum number of different-sized cliques that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph of `n=128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Interpret the \"Simultaneously Appear\" Clause:** The phrase \"simultaneously appear\" is key. I will interpret this in the context of a \"packing\" problem, which is common in combinatorics. This means I'll assume the vertex sets of the different-sized cliques must be disjoint. If the sets could overlap, the answer would simply be 128 (by taking a complete graph `K_128`, which contains induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128). The disjoint interpretation poses a more interesting challenge that requires a calculation, fitting the spirit of the prompt.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Task:** Under the disjoint-clique assumption, we are packing cliques into 128 vertices. To maximize the *number* of cliques with different sizes, we should use the smallest possible distinct sizes for them. This means we should use cliques of size 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.\n\n4.  **Set Up the Constraint:** The sum of the vertices of these disjoint cliques cannot exceed the total number of vertices available, `n=128`. This gives us the inequality:\n    `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + m <= 128`\n    where `m` is the number of different clique sizes.\n\n5.  **Develop the Algorithm:** I will write a Python script to find the largest integer `m` that satisfies this inequality. The script will:\n    *   Start with a sum of 0 and a clique size of 1.\n    *   Iteratively add the next clique size to the sum as long as the total does not exceed 128.\n    *   Keep track of the clique sizes used.\n    *   The final count of clique sizes will be our answer, `m`.\n\n6.  **Format the Output:** The script will print the explanation, the final equation showing the sum of the clique sizes, and the final answer in the requested format.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of different-sized, vertex-disjoint cliques\n    that can fit into a graph with a given number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128  # Total number of vertices in the graph\n\n    # We want to find the maximum number of different clique sizes, let's call it 'm'.\n    # To maximize 'm', we should choose the smallest possible distinct clique sizes: 1, 2, 3, ...\n    # We need to find the largest 'm' such that 1 + 2 + ... + m <= n.\n\n    clique_sizes = []\n    total_vertices_used = 0\n    current_clique_size = 1\n\n    # Greedily add cliques of increasing size as long as they fit.\n    while total_vertices_used + current_clique_size <= n:\n        # \"Pack\" a clique of the current size\n        total_vertices_used += current_clique_size\n        clique_sizes.append(current_clique_size)\n\n        # Move to the next distinct size\n        current_clique_size += 1\n\n    # The maximum number of different clique sizes is the number of terms we could sum up.\n    max_m = len(clique_sizes)\n\n    # As requested, we will output the final equation.\n    # This equation shows the sum of the sizes of the cliques we packed.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, clique_sizes))\n    final_sum = sum(clique_sizes)\n\n    print(f\"To find the maximum number of different clique sizes (m) that can appear as vertex-disjoint induced subgraphs in a graph with {n} vertices, we find the largest m such that the sum of the first m positive integers is at most {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the sum of the chosen clique sizes is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {final_sum}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe total vertices used is {final_sum}, which is <= {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The next clique size would be {current_clique_size}, making the sum {final_sum + current_clique_size}, which exceeds {n}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThus, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is {max_m}.\")\n\n\nsolve_clique_packing()\n\n# The final answer is the maximum number of different clique sizes.\n# Based on the calculation, this is 15.\n# 1 + 2 + ... + 15 = 120 <= 128\n# 1 + 2 + ... + 16 = 136 > 128\nprint(\"\\n<<<15>>>\")\n```"
