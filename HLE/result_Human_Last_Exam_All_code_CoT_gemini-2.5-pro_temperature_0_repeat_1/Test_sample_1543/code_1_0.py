    print("The winning sequence begins with the move 1. Qj3+.\n")
    print("Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the main line of play:\n")

    # Move 1
    print("1. White: Queen from d3 to j3 (Qj3+)")
    print("   This move puts the Black King in check. Black must respond.")
    print("   Black has two primary defenses. We must consider both to confirm the mate is forced.")
    print("   - Defense A (leads to mate in 2): Black plays ...Cj7 (Chancellor to j7).")
    print("     White responds with 2. Ai4# (Archbishop to i4). This is checkmate.")
    print("     The Archbishop's knight-move check cannot be blocked, the Archbishop cannot be captured, and the King has no escape squares.")
    print("   - Defense B (optimal, leads to mate in 3): Black plays ...Ki8 (King to i8).")
    print("     Since Black plays optimally, they will choose this line to prolong the game.\n")

    # Move 2
    print("2. White: Archbishop from h2 to i4 (Ai4+)")
    print("   This is a check from the Archbishop's knight-move capability.")
    print("   Black: King from i8 to h8 (...Kh8)")
    print("   This is Black's only legal move.\n")

    # Move 3
    print("3. White: Queen from j3 to h3 (Qh3#)")
    print("   This is checkmate. The Black King on h8 is attacked by the Queen.")
    print("   - The King cannot escape: g8 and g7 are covered by the Queen; i8 is covered by the Archbishop; h7 and i7 are blocked.")
    print("   - The check cannot be blocked.")
    print("   - The Queen cannot be captured.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Since Black's best defense (...Ki8) forces a mate in 3 moves for White, the minimal number of moves for White to guarantee a win is 3.")
