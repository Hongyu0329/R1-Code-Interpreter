    # Path a: C -> F (Nectar caffeine -> Flower level foraging duration)
    # Reasoning: Caffeine is a stimulant. In nectar, it can act as a reward for pollinators,
    # encouraging them to forage longer on a single flower to consume more of the rewarding substance.
    # Therefore, higher Nectar caffeine (C) is expected to lead to longer Foraging duration (F).

    # Path b: F -> Y (Flower level foraging duration -> total yield)
    # Reasoning: A longer foraging duration on a flower generally leads to more successful pollination,
    # as more pollen grains are transferred to the stigma. Better pollination directly increases
    # fruit and seed set, thus increasing total yield (Y).
    path_b_sign = '+'

    # Path c: C -> R (Nectar caffeine -> pollinator retention)
    # Reasoning: Caffeine has been shown to enhance memory in pollinators like bees. A memorable and
    # rewarding nectar source increases the likelihood that pollinators will preferentially and
    # repeatedly return to the same plant or patch (i.e., higher retention).
    path_c_sign = '+'

    print(f"  - Logic: Caffeine (C) enhances pollinator memory, leading to higher pollinator retention (R).")
    print(f"  - Sign of 'c' is: {path_c_sign}\n")

    # Path d: R -> Y (pollinator retention -> total yield)
    # Reasoning: Higher pollinator retention ensures more consistent and frequent pollination services
    # for the plant population. This increased rate of successful pollination events leads to a
    # higher overall total yield (Y).

    print(f"  - Logic: Higher pollinator retention (R) leads to more pollination events and higher yield (Y).")

    # Path e: C -> Y (Nectar caffeine -> total yield)
    # Reasoning: This path represents the direct effect of caffeine production on yield. While producing
    # any secondary metabolite like caffeine has a metabolic cost (a potential negative effect),
    # caffeine can also serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or nectar robbers. This protective
    # role would prevent damage to flowers and preserve yield potential. Given that the trait of producing
    # caffeine in nectar likely evolved due to a net benefit, and all pollinator-mediated paths are positive,
    # a positive direct effect is the most plausible scenario.
