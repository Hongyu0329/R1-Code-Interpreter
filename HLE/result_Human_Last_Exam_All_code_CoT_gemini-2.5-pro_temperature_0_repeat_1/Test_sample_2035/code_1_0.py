# We need to check if the condition for the existence of real solutions holds.
# The condition is that (x_i^0)^2 must be non-negative for all i.
# This simplifies to checking if (n*(n+1))/(2*(n-1)) - i >= 0 for all i from 1 to n.
# We only need to check for the 'worst case', which is i = n.
value_to_check = (n * (n + 1)) / (2 * (n - 1)) - n

# If value_to_check is negative, the set of initial conditions is empty.
if value_to_check < 0:
    # The area 'S' of an empty set is 0.
    S = 0
else:
    # This case is not reached with the given parameters.
    # If it were, S would be a positive value that would need to be calculated.
    S = -1 # Placeholder for an unreached case

# The final expression to calculate is ((1 - e**-T) / pi) * S + 10**15.
# The values of T and pi are not needed because S is 0.
term1 = 0
term2 = 10**15
result = term1 + term2
