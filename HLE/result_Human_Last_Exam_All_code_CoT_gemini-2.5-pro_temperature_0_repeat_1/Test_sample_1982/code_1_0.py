    # Step 1: Define the given parameters from the problem statement.
    c1 = 10**4

    # The problem provides expressions for l1 and alpha1.
    # We use Python's arbitrary-precision integers for accurate calculation.
    l1 = (1 + 10**5)**5
    alpha1 = (1 + 10**5)**6 * (1 - 10**5 + 10**10)

    # Step 2: Derive the relationship for u1 from the matrix equation.
    # The matrix equation is:
    # [[0, 1], [0, 0]] * [[x11, x12], [x21, x22]] + [[x11, x12], [x21, x22]] * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = \
    # [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + [[c1, 0], [0, c2]] * [[u1, 0], [0, u2]]
    #
    # After multiplication and addition, the equation becomes:
    # [[x11 + x21, x12 + x22], [x21, x22]] = [[1 + c1*u1, 0], [0, 1 + c2*u2]]
    #
    # By equating the elements of the matrices, we get a system of equations.
    # From the (2,1) element: x21 = 0
    # From the (1,1) element: x11 + x21 = 1 + c1*u1
    # Substituting x21 = 0 into the second equation gives: x11 = 1 + c1*u1
    # Rearranging for u1, we get: u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1

    # Step 3: Determine the value of x11.
    # The problem is ambiguous, but the most plausible interpretation is that x11 is the ratio of alpha1 to l1.
    # This assumption uses all the given information and simplifies nicely.
    # Let's calculate x11 = alpha1 / l1.
    # The expression (1 + 10**5) * (1 - 10**5 + 10**10) is in the form (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2) = a^3+b^3
    # with a=1 and b=10**5. So, the result is 1**3 + (10**5)**3 = 1 + 10**15.
    
    # We use integer division // as the result is an exact integer.
    x11 = alpha1 // l1

    # Step 4: Calculate the final value of u1.
    u1 = (x11 - 1) // c1

    # Step 5: Print the results and the final equation with numerical values.
    print("From the matrix equation, we derive the formula for the control u1:")
