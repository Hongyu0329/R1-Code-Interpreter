    This script explains and provides the theoretical lower bound on the number of queries
    for an SQ algorithm to learn a two-hidden-layer ReLU network under the specified conditions.

    The problem is to find the minimum number of queries for an SQ algorithm to learn:
    - A two-hidden-layer ReLU network.
    - The network size (number of neurons, k) is polynomial in the dimension d, i.e., k = poly(d).
    - The input data is from a standard Gaussian distribution N(0, I_d).
    - The learning goal is to achieve a squared loss of 1/poly(d).
    - The SQ query tolerance is non-negligible (e.g., >= 1/poly(d)).

    This is a known hard problem in learning theory. The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  It has been proven that there exist families of neural networks that are very difficult
        to distinguish from each other using only statistical queries.
    2.  The established SQ lower bound for learning a sum of k ReLUs (a one-hidden-layer network)
        is d^立(log k). This hardness result extends to two-hidden-layer networks.
    3.  In this problem, the network size k is a polynomial in d. We can write this as k = d^c
        for some constant c > 0.
    4.  Substituting k = d^c into the log term of the lower bound gives:
        log(k) = log(d^c) = c * log(d).
    5.  Since c is a constant, the term c * log(d) is of the order 立(log d).
    6.  Therefore, the overall lower bound on the number of queries becomes d^立(log d).

    This is a super-polynomial function, meaning it grows faster than any polynomial in d.
    The script below prints this final formula. The request to "output each number" is
    interpreted as "output each component" of the final expression.
