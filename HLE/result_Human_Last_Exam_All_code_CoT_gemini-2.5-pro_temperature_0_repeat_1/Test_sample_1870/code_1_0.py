    print("1. δ ≥ ω₂:")
    print("   Any tower of length ω₁ can be shown to have a lower bound using a diagonal intersection construction on club sets. This implies that a tower with no lower bound must have a length greater than ω₁, so δ must be at least ω₂.")

    print("   A deep theorem by Saharon Shelah shows how to construct a tower of length ω₂ that does not have a lower bound. This proves that the minimal length is at most ω₂.")
