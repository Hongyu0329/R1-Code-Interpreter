# Based on the derivation, the function f(z) that satisfies the given
# functional equation and conditions is the reciprocal of the Gamma function,
# scaled by a constant.

# The final explicit form is:
# f(z) = sqrt(pi) / Gamma(z)

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The constant in this equation is sqrt(pi).
