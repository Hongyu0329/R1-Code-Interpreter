# This script prints the solution to the problem.
# The problem asks to identify which types of functions are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.
# Based on the analysis, the correct choices are:
# F: A continuous function on [a,b]
# L: A measurable function whose absolute value is integrable
# M: A bounded continuous function on (a,b)

# The final answer is a string of these letters in order.
