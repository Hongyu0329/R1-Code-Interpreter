    "An all-or-nothing vaccine is a type of vaccine that provides complete protection to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection to the rest. The term \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" in this context refers to the overall protective effect of the vaccine across the entire vaccinated population. We can determine if the standard formula for vaccine efficacy, `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)`, correctly measures this by deriving the relationship mathematically.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation presented in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef explain_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains whether 1-IRR overestimates, underestimates, or\n    correctly estimates the efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Let's analyze the relationship between 1-IRR and the efficacy of an all-or-nothing vaccine.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define the model for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\")\n    print(\"Let VE_S be the proportion of vaccinated people who are fully (100%) protected.\")\n    print(\"This means the remaining proportion, (1 - VE_S), is not protected at all (0% protection).\")\n    print(\"VE_S is the true, underlying efficacy of this type of vaccine.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet IR_u be the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (IR_v).\")\n    print(\"In the vaccinated group, only the unprotected fraction, which is (1 - VE_S), can get infected.\")\n    print(\"The risk for this unprotected fraction is the same as the unvaccinated group, so their incidence rate is IR_u.\")\n    print(\"The protected fraction has an incidence rate of 0.\")\n    print(\"The average incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group (IR_v) is the weighted average:\")\n    print(\"IR_v = (Rate for protected * Proportion protected) + (Rate for unprotected * Proportion unprotected)\")\n    print(\"IR_v = (0 * VE_S) + (IR_u * (1 - VE_S))\")\n    print(\"IR_v = IR_u * (1 - VE_S)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR).\")\n    print(\"The IRR is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the unvaccinated group.\")\n    print(\"IRR = IR_v / IR_u\")\n    print(\"Now, we substitute our expression for IR_v from Step 2:\")\n    print(\"IRR = (IR_u * (1 - VE_S)) / IR_u\")\n    print(\"The 'IR_u' terms on the top and bottom cancel out, leaving:\")\n    print(\"IRR = 1 - VE_S\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Calculate the final vaccine efficacy (VE) from the IRR.\")\n    print(\"The standard formula for calculating VE from trial data is: VE = 1 - IRR\")\n    print(\"Now, we substitute our result for IRR from Step 3:\")\n    print(\"VE = 1 - (1 - VE_S)\")\n    print(\"VE = 1 - 1 + VE_S\")\n    print(\"VE = VE_S\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"The final calculated vaccine efficacy (VE = 1 - IRR) is exactly equal to VE_S.\")\n    print(\"Since VE_S is the true efficacy parameter that defines an all-or-nothing vaccine, this means that\")\n    print(\"the 1-IRR formula correctly estimates the vaccine's efficacy.\")\n\nexplain_vaccine_efficacy()\n<<<C>>>"
