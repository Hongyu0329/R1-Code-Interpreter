    print("The canton itself contains a red cross.\n")

    print("### Step 2: Simplifying the Matrix using Row Operations ###")
    print("Most of the flag is a solid red field. All rows below the canton are identical vectors of 'a's.")

    print("Subtracting r_field from all other rows is a rank-preserving operation.")

    print("The rank of the modified canton block is rank((b-a) * W), which is rank(W) if b != a.")
    print("The row r_field is linearly independent from the rows of the modified canton (which are zero outside the canton area).")
    print("Therefore, the total rank of the flag matrix M is:\n")
    print("rank(M) = rank(W) + 1\n")

    print("### Step 4: Finding the Rank of the Canton Matrix W ###")
    print("W is a binary matrix representing the white background of the canton, which contains a red cross.")
    print("Its rank is the number of linearly independent row patterns.")
    print("A standard cross shape creates three distinct, non-zero row patterns:")
    print(" - Pattern 1: A row entirely of 1s (for parts of the canton above or below the cross).")
    print(" - Pattern 2: A row of 1s with a block of 0s (intersecting the vertical arm of the cross).")
    print(" - Pattern 3: A row of 1s with a wider block of 0s (intersecting the horizontal bar of the cross).")
    print("These three patterns can be shown to be linearly independent vectors.\n")
