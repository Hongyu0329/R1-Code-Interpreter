        "framework to explain events that appear to alter the laws of nature. He did not see miracles as 'unnatural' "
        "or 'against nature' in an absolute sense. Instead, he developed specialized terminology and concepts:\n\n"
        "1.  **Ordinary Course of Nature (consuetudo naturae):** Augustine described this as the regular, "
        "customary way the world works, which we observe and call 'natural law'.\n\n"
        "2.  **God's Will:** He argued that nature's course is simply an expression of God's continuous will. A miracle, "
        "therefore, is not contrary to nature as God ultimately ordained it, but only contrary to the *usual course* of nature "
        "that we know.\n\n"
        "3.  **Seminal Reasons (rationes seminales):** Augustine proposed that God placed latent potentialities or 'seeds' "
        "within creation from the beginning, which could be activated by God's will at a later time to produce "
        "extraordinary results.\n\n"
        "This framework allowed him to explain both the virgin birth (as an act of God's will using a latent potential in creation) "
        "and the changes to the natural world at the Fall (as a shift in the 'ordinary course of nature' from a pre-lapsarian to a post-lapsarian state)."
