The primary reason is that modern MRI coils contain active detuning circuits, typically using PIN diodes. These circuits are designed to make the coil non-resonant during the high-power transmit pulse to prevent damage and image artifacts. When the coil is disconnected from the scanner, this detuning circuit is often in its default "detuned" state, shifting the resonance far from the operating frequency, which is why your VNA cannot detect it.
