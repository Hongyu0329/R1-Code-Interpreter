def get_circle_packing_symmetry(num_circles):
    """
    Provides the symmetry group for the best-known packing of N circles in a circle.

    This function relies on lookup from established databases of circle packing results.
    The problem of finding the optimal packing is computationally very hard, and the
    "best known" packings are the current state-of-the-art, often found via numerical
    optimization.

    Args:
        num_circles (int): The number of congruent circles.

    Returns:
        str: The symmetry group in Schoenflies notation.
