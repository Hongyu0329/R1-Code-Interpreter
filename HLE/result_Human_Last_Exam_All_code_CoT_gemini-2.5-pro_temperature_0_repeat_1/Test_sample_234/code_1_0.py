def solve():

    This function determines how many of the seven properties must always be true for the set S.

    The properties are:
    1. Open
    2. Closed
    3. Connected
    4. Compact
    5. Dense
    6. Connected complement
    7. Trivial first singular homology group

    Our analysis shows:
    - S is always Open. For any x in S, there is a ball B(x, e) on which f is an isometry.
      Any y in this ball is also in S because a smaller ball B(y, r) is contained in B(x, e).
    - S is always Dense. The complement S^c must have an empty interior. If it had an interior U,
      the property (P1) holding everywhere in U would imply that f is a local isometry on a neighborhood
      of any point in U, which means U is a subset of S, a contradiction.
    - S is not always Closed. Counterexample: f reflects one half-space. S is R^n minus a hyperplane.
    - S is not always Connected. Same counterexample as for Closed.
    - S is not always Compact. As a non-empty open set in R^n (n>=1), it cannot be compact.
    - S's complement is not always Connected. Counterexample: f can be constructed such that S^c = {a, b}, two distinct points.
    - S does not always have a Trivial first singular homology group. Counterexample: f can be constructed
      such that S = R^2 \ {unit circle}, for which H_1(S) = Z.

    Therefore, exactly two properties must always be true.
