    "My plan to solve this problem involves a step-by-step analysis of the provided chemical data to deduce the structure of the unknown compound and then determine its official IUPAC name.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula ($C_7H_{14}$):** I will first calculate the degree of unsaturation. This tells me if the molecule contains double bonds, triple bonds, or rings.\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data:** I will interpret each signal. The chemical shift (the number in ppm) indicates the electronic environment of the carbon (e.g., alkene, alkane), and the multiplicity (s, d, t, q) tells me how many hydrogen atoms are directly attached to that carbon.\n3.  **Reconcile Data with Formula:** I will compare the number of carbons and hydrogens derived from the NMR data with the molecular formula. There are 6 signals for 7 carbons, and the initial hydrogen count from the signals doesn't match the formula. This discrepancy is a key clue that will help me identify equivalent carbons in the structure.\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:** Using the information gathered, I will piece together the fragments of the molecule like a puzzle until I have a single, valid structure that is consistent with all the data.\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:** Once the correct structure is identified, I will apply the official IUPAC nomenclature rules to find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group and name the substituents correctly to arrive at the final name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hydrocarbon_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon from its molecular formula and 13C NMR data,\n    and prints the step-by-step reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(\"The molecular formula is C7H14.\")\n    print(\"For a saturated acyclic alkane with 7 carbons, the formula would be CnH(2n+2) = C7H16.\")\n    print(\"The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, which indicates one degree of unsaturation.
