    # Step 1: Define the parameters of the problem based on the properties of E8.

    h = 30
    # The desired order of the torsion elements in the quotient group A/Z.
    k = 10

    # Step 2: Characterize the torsion elements.
    # In the quotient group A/Z, a Coxeter element 'c' has order h.
    # To obtain an element of order k, we must take the d-th power of c.
    d = h // k

    # Step 3: Determine the structure and length of the minimal elements.
    # A Coxeter element 'c' is a product of all n distinct generators, so its length is n.

    # The summit set of a Coxeter element c is the set of all distinct Coxeter elements

    # For the Artin group of type E8, this number has been computed.
