    # The problem is to find the smallest possible number of connected components
    # of CL(X), where X is a totally-disconnected ultrametric space with
    # infinitely many points.

    # Step 1: Determine the lower bound for the number of components.
    # There is a fundamental theorem in hyperspace theory that states:
    # "A metric space X is connected if and only if its Wijsman hyperspace CL(X) is connected."
    #
    # The problem specifies that X is an ultrametric space with infinitely many points.
    # Any ultrametric space with more than one point is totally disconnected.
    # A totally disconnected space is, by definition, not connected.
    #
    # Since X is not connected, its hyperspace CL(X) cannot be connected.
    # A non-connected space must have at least 2 connected components.
    lower_bound = 2

    # Step 2: Show that this lower bound is achievable.
    # We need to find an example of a space X that satisfies the problem's conditions
    # and for which CL(X) has exactly 2 connected components.
    #
    # Another theorem from hyperspace theory (by Guerrero and Rojas-Mancilla, 2021) states:
    # "If X is a non-compact, locally compact, non-Archimedean (ultrametric) space,
    # then its hyperspace CL(X) has exactly two connected components."
    # The two components are the set of non-empty compact subsets and the set of non-compact closed subsets.
    #
    # The field of p-adic numbers, denoted Q_p (for any prime p), is a space that
    # fits these requirements:
    #   - It is an ultrametric space with infinitely many points.
    #   - It is non-compact (because it is unbounded).
    #   - It is locally compact (all balls in Q_p are compact).
    #
    # Since Q_p satisfies the conditions of the theorem, CL(Q_p) has exactly 2 connected components.
    achievable_number = 2

    # Step 3: Conclude the smallest possible number.
    # From Step 1, we know the number of components must be at least 2.
    # From Step 2, we know that the number 2 is achievable.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible number of connected components is 2.
    smallest_possible_number = 2

    # Print the explanation and the final answer in the form of an equation.

    print(f"5. Combining these facts, the smallest possible value for N is {smallest_possible_number}.")
