        "C. Average FICO scores on the loans": "A key indicator of risk and a strong factor. However, the acceptance of low FICO scores was a symptom of the more fundamental problem of poor underwriting standards.",
        "D. The 10 year US Treasury rate": "A contributing economic factor that influenced mortgage rates, but not the root cause of the poor quality of the underlying loans.",
        "E. Default rates": "This is the direct cause of losses but is a symptom, not the root cause. The key question is *why* the defaults occurred at unprecedented rates.",
        "F. The quality of the loan issuer and RMBS originator": "This is the most likely root cause. The 'originate-to-distribute' model incentivized originators to prioritize loan volume over quality, leading to systemic abandonment of underwriting standards, 'liar loans' (low/no documentation), and the creation of a massive pool of fundamentally unsound mortgages.",
        "G. Recovery rates": "This is a measure of the severity of the loss after a default. Low recovery rates (due to falling home prices) exacerbated the problem but did not cause the initial defaults.",
        "H. The rating of the credit agency on issuance": "This was a critical enabling factor. Inaccurate AAA ratings allowed these risky securities to be sold widely. However, the ratings were flawed *because* they failed to assess the poor quality of the underlying loans, which stems from the originator."
