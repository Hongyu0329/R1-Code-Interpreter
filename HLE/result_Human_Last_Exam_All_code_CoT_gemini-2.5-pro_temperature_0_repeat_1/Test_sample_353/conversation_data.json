    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method, we need to find the tangent lines from the origin to the boundary of the stability region in the complex plane. The angle $\\alpha$ is then derived from the argument of these tangency points.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  The stability boundary for BDF4 is described by the complex function $\\mu(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta}) / e^{i4\\theta}$, where $\\rho(z)$ is the characteristic polynomial of BDF4.\n2.  The condition for a line from the origin to be tangent to this curve at a point $\\mu(\\theta)$ leads to a polynomial equation for $x = 2\\cos(\\theta)$.\n3.  This polynomial equation is $5x^4 - 32x^3 + 72x^2 - 64x + 16 = 0$.\n4.  We solve this equation to find the value of $\\cos(\\theta)$ at the tangency point. The equation has roots $x=2$ (a triple root) and $x=2/5$. The root $x=2$ corresponds to $\\theta=0$, which is a trivial point on the real axis. The tangency point is given by the non-trivial root $x=2/5$.\n5.  From $x = 2\\cos(\\theta) = 2/5$, we get $\\cos(\\theta) = 1/5$. We can then find $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sqrt{1 - (1/5)^2} = 2\\sqrt{6}/5$.\n6.  We substitute these values back into the expression for $\\mu$ to find the complex coordinates $(x_\\mu, y_\\mu)$ of the tangency point.\n7.  The stability angle $\\alpha$ is then given by the formula $\\alpha = \\arctan(-y_\\mu / x_\\mu)$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these calculations with exact symbolic arithmetic, avoiding any floating-point inaccuracies.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the polynomial equation for x = 2*cos(theta)\n    # This equation is derived from the tangency condition for the stability boundary.\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    poly_in_x = 5*x**4 - 32*x**3 + 72*x**2 - 64*x + 16\n\n    # Step 2: Solve the polynomial equation for x\n    roots_x = sympy.solve(poly_in_x, x)\n\n    # The roots are [2/5, 2].
