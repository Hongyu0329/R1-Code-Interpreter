    "To determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram, we first need to establish its precise topology based on the description.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Diagram:** The problem describes a diagram with \"two vertices\" and \"four field contractions\" (propagators). Assuming we are in a simple scalar field theory like $\\phi^4$ theory, where each vertex has four legs, this description can correspond to a few different diagrams. The most straightforward interpretation is a diagram where the two vertices are connected to each other by all four propagators. This forms a two-loop vacuum diagram.\n\n2.  **Define the Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, S, of a Feynman diagram is the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram's topology unchanged.\n\n3.  **Identify the Symmetries:** For the diagram with two vertices connected by four lines:\n    *   **Line Symmetry:** The four propagators connecting the vertices are indistinguishable. We can permute them in any way, which gives a factor of $4!$ (4 factorial).\n    *   **Vertex Symmetry:** The two vertices are from the same type of interaction, making them indistinguishable. We can swap them, which gives a factor of $2!$ (2 factorial).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor is the product of the number of possible permutations for each type of symmetry.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be written to perform this calculation and print the result, showing each component of the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The user wants to find the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram.\n# Based on the description \"two vertices and four field contractions\", we assume\n# the topology is two vertices connected directly by four propagators (lines).\n\n# 1. Define the number of identical components in the diagram.\n# Number of identical lines connecting the two vertices.\nnum_lines = 4\n# Number of identical vertices.\nnum_vertices = 2\n\n# 2. Calculate the number of permutations for each set of identical components.\n# The number of permutations of n identical items is n!.\nline_permutations = math.factorial(num_lines)\nvertex_permutations = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n# 3. The total symmetry factor is the product of these permutation factors.\nsymmetry_factor = line_permutations * vertex_permutations\n\n# 4.
