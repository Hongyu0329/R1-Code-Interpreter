def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the specified topology problem.

    The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of the set of points of a cyclic element S
    that also belong to some other cyclic element of a Peano continuum X.

    Let S be a cyclic element. Let P be the set of points in S that also belong to some other cyclic element T.
    P = S ∩ (∪_{T ≠ S} T)

    1. The intersection of two distinct cyclic elements is at most one point.
       |S ∩ T| ≤ 1 for T ≠ S.

    2. An example can be constructed to show that a cardinality of 2 is possible.
       Let S be a circle. Attach two other circles, T1 and T2, to S at two distinct points, p1 and p2.
       The space X = S ∪ T1 ∪ T2 is a Peano continuum.
       S, T1, and T2 are its cyclic elements.
       The set of points on S that belong to other cyclic elements is {p1, p2}.
       The cardinality is 2.

    3. It can be shown using deeper theorems of topological analysis of Peano continua
       that this number cannot exceed 2. If a cyclic element S were to intersect
       three other distinct cyclic elements T1, T2, T3, it would violate
       the structural properties of the Peano continuum.

    Therefore, the maximum cardinality is 2.
