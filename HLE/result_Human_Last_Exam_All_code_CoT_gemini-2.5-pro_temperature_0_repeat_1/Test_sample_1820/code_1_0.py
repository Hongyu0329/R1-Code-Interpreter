    Calculates the theoretical completeness bound for the ontology mapping scenario.

    In this scenario, we analyze the mapping between two ontologies, O1 and O2.
    O1 has mergeable sibling classes, a branching factor 'b', and depth 'd'.
    O2 has a strict, disjoint categorical structure.

    Statement D proposes that the theoretical completeness of the mapping is bounded
    by ln(b)/d. This is based on an information-theoretic view where ln(b)
    represents the information at each branching point, and this is amortized
    over the depth 'd'. The loss of completeness comes from the inability to map
    O1's 'mergeable' siblings to O2's 'disjoint' siblings without losing
    logical information.
