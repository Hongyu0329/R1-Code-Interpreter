    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity, we first need to identify the product of the specified reaction and then apply the complexity formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, a cyclic α-halo ketone, proceeds through a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The subsequent ring-opening by a nucleophile (like hydroxide) followed by an acidic workup results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted into a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product's Structure:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid consists of a five-membered carbon ring attached to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). We will consider only the non-hydrogen atoms for the complexity calculation:\n    *   5 Carbon atoms in the cyclopentane ring.\n    *   1 Carbon atom in the carboxyl group.\n    *   2 Oxygen atoms in the carboxyl group.\n    *   This gives a total of **N = 8** non-hydrogen atoms.\n\n3.  **Calculate Böttcher Molecular Complexity:** The formula is `C = N * (log2(N))^2 / sum(d_ij)`, where `N` is the number of non-hydrogen atoms and `sum(d_ij)` is the sum of the topological distances (shortest path of bonds) between all pairs of non-hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   Represent the molecule (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) as a graph, where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.\n    *   Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to compute the shortest path distances between all pairs of atoms.\n    *   Sum these distances to get `sum(d_ij)`.\n    *   Substitute `N` and `sum(d_ij)` into the Böttcher formula to calculate the complexity.\n    *   Print the steps of the calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_bottcher_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Böttcher Molecular Complexity for the product of the\n    Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    # We represent its non-hydrogen atoms as a graph.\n    # C1-C5 are the ring carbons, C6 is the carboxyl carbon,\n    # O1 and O2 are the carboxyl oxygens.\n    # C1 is the ring carbon attached to the carboxyl group (C6).\n    molecule_graph = {\n        'C1': ['C2', 'C5', 'C6'],\n        'C2': ['C1', 'C3'],\n        'C3': ['C2', 'C4'],\n        'C4': ['C3', 'C5'],\n        'C5': ['C1', 'C4'],\n        'C6': ['C1', 'O1', 'O2'],\n        'O1': ['C6'],  # Carbonyl oxygen\n        'O2': ['C6']   # Hydroxyl oxygen\n    }\n\n    atoms = list(molecule_graph.keys())\n    N = len(atoms)\n\n    def bfs(graph, start_node):\n        \"\"\"\n        Performs a Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path from\n        a start node to all other nodes in the graph.\n        \"\"\"\n        distances = {node: -1 for node in graph}\n        distances[start_node] = 0\n        queue = collections.deque([start_node])\n\n        while queue:\n            current_node = queue.popleft()\n            for neighbor in graph[current_node]:\n                if distances[neighbor] == -1:\n                    distances[neighbor] = distances[current_node] + 1\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\n        return distances\n\n    # Calculate the sum of all-pairs shortest paths (sum_d_ij)\n    sum_d_ij = 0\n    for atom in atoms:\n        distances = bfs(molecule_graph, atom)\n        sum_d_ij += sum(distances.values())\n\n    # Calculate Böttcher Molecular Complexity\n    log2_N = math.log2(N)\n    numerator = N * (log2_N ** 2)\n    complexity = numerator / sum_d_ij\n\n    # Print the calculation steps\n    print(\"The product of the reaction is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"Calculating the Böttcher Molecular Complexity: C = (N * (log2(N))^2) / sum(d_ij)\\n\")\n    print(f\"1.
