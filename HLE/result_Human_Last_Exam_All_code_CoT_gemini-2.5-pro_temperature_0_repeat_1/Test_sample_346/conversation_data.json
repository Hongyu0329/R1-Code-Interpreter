    "My plan to solve this problem is to interpret the complex SKI combinator expression as a series of arithmetic operations on Church numerals. I will not perform a low-level, step-by-step reduction of the combinators, as that would be computationally intensive and complex. Instead, I will identify the known Church numerals and functional patterns within the expression and evaluate the resulting arithmetic.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Expression**: I will break down the given SKI expression into its main components. I'll identify the parts that represent known Church numerals, like `2` and `3`. The successor function `succ = S(S(K(S))(K))` is a key component for this.\n2.  **Analyze the Structure**: The expression has a repeating pattern of `S(I)`. I will analyze the function of this pattern, `H = S(I)`, which turns out to be `H x y = y (x y)`.\n3.  **Evaluate Nested Functions**: The expression is a nested application of this `H` function. I will evaluate this structure from the inside out.\n4.  **Interpret Church Arithmetic**: The application of one Church numeral to another, written as `(m n)`, corresponds to exponentiation, specifically `n` raised to the power of `m` (`n^m`). I will apply this rule to evaluate the expression.\n5.  **Calculate n**: By performing the series of exponentiations, I will find the final integer value of `n`.\n6.  **Calculate log_2(n)**: Finally, I will compute the base-2 logarithm of the calculated `n`.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this high-level arithmetic evaluation and print out each step of the calculation to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for log_2(n) where n is a Church integer represented by a complex SKI expression.\n# This script decodes the SKI expression into Church numeral arithmetic to find n.\n\n# Step 1: Deconstruct the SKI expression.\n# The expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))))(B))` where:\n# A = `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is the successor of Church numeral 1 (represented by I), so A = 2.\n# B = `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` is the successor of Church numeral 2 (represented by S(I)(I)), so B = 3.\n# The expression simplifies to `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))(3)`.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the structure of the expression.\n# Let H = S(I). The reduction rule for H is `H x y = S(I) x y -> I y (x y) -> y (x y)`.\n# The expression can be written as `H(H(H(K(2))))(3)`.\n# Evaluating this structure from the outside in gives `3(3(3(2)))`.\n\n# Step 3: Interpret the Church numeral application `(m n)`.\n# In Church arithmetic, applying numeral `m` to `n`, written as `(m n)`,\n# corresponds to exponentiation `n^m`.\n# We calculate `3(3(3(2)))` from right to left.\n\nprint(\"The SKI expression simplifies to the Church numeral application: 3(3(3(2)))\")\nprint(\"In Church arithmetic, (m n) means n^m.\")\n\n# Calculation of the first application: (3 2)\nc2 = 2\nc3 = 3\nval1 = c2 ** c3\nprint(f\"First step: (3 2) = {c2}^{c3} = {val1}\")\n\n# Calculation of the second application: (3 8)\nval2 = val1 ** c3\nprint(f\"Second step: (3 {val1}) = {val1}^{c3} = {val2}\")\n\n# Calculation of the final value n: (3 512)\nn = val2 ** c3\nprint(f\"Final value of n: (3 {val2}) = {val2}^{c3} = {n}\")\n\n# Step 4: Show the full calculation and find log_2(n).\n# n = ((2^3)^3)^3 = (8^3)^3 = 512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27\nlog2_n = math.log2(n)\n\nprint(f\"The full equation for n is: (({c2}^{c3})^{c3})^{c3} = {n}\")\nprint(f\"In powers of 2, this is: ((2^3)^3)^3 = 2^(3*3*3) = 2^27\")\nprint(f\"The question is to find log_2(n).\")\nprint(f\"log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = {int(log2_n)}\")\n```\n<<<27>>>"
