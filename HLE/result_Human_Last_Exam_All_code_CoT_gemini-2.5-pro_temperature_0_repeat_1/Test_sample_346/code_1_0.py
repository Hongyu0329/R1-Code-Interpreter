# The problem asks for log_2(n) where n is a Church integer represented by a complex SKI expression.
# This script decodes the SKI expression into Church numeral arithmetic to find n.

# Step 1: Deconstruct the SKI expression.
# The expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))))(B))` where:
# A = `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is the successor of Church numeral 1 (represented by I), so A = 2.
# B = `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` is the successor of Church numeral 2 (represented by S(I)(I)), so B = 3.
# The expression simplifies to `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))(3)`.

# Step 2: Analyze the structure of the expression.
# Let H = S(I). The reduction rule for H is `H x y = S(I) x y -> I y (x y) -> y (x y)`.
# The expression can be written as `H(H(H(K(2))))(3)`.
# Evaluating this structure from the outside in gives `3(3(3(2)))`.

# Step 3: Interpret the Church numeral application `(m n)`.
# In Church arithmetic, applying numeral `m` to `n`, written as `(m n)`,
# corresponds to exponentiation `n^m`.
# We calculate `3(3(3(2)))` from right to left.

print("The SKI expression simplifies to the Church numeral application: 3(3(3(2)))")
print("In Church arithmetic, (m n) means n^m.")

# Calculation of the first application: (3 2)
c2 = 2
c3 = 3
val1 = c2 ** c3
print(f"First step: (3 2) = {c2}^{c3} = {val1}")

# Calculation of the second application: (3 8)
val2 = val1 ** c3
print(f"Second step: (3 {val1}) = {val1}^{c3} = {val2}")

# Calculation of the final value n: (3 512)
n = val2 ** c3
print(f"Final value of n: (3 {val2}) = {val2}^{c3} = {n}")

# Step 4: Show the full calculation and find log_2(n).
# n = ((2^3)^3)^3 = (8^3)^3 = 512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27
log2_n = math.log2(n)

print(f"The full equation for n is: (({c2}^{c3})^{c3})^{c3} = {n}")
print(f"In powers of 2, this is: ((2^3)^3)^3 = 2^(3*3*3) = 2^27")
print(f"The question is to find log_2(n).")
print(f"log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = {int(log2_n)}")
