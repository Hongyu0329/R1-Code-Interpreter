    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Graph:** The graph in question is $K_{1000,1000}$, which is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions of 1000 vertices each. This is a specific instance of the graph family $K_{n,n}$ where $n=1000$.\n2.  **Recall the Definition:** The Alon-Tarsi number, $AT(G)$, is a graph property related to list coloring. It's defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which an orientation of the graph exists with a maximum out-degree of at most $k-1$ and where the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs.\n3.  **Apply the Known Theorem:** Fortunately, the Alon-Tarsi number for the family of graphs $K_{n,n}$ is a well-known result in algebraic graph theory. The theorem states that for any $n \\ge 1$:\n    $AT(K_{n,n}) = n + 1$\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** I will apply this theorem to the specific case where $n=1000$ to find the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will provide a simple Python script that defines $n$, applies the formula, and prints the final equation and the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_knn():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for the complete bipartite graph K_n,n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the value of n for the graph K_{1000,1000}.\n    n = 1000\n\n    # Step 2: State the theorem for the Alon-Tarsi number of K_n,n.\n    # The theorem is AT(K_n,n) = n + 1.\n    print(f\"The Alon-Tarsi number of a complete bipartite graph K_n,n is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"AT(K_n,n) = n + 1\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the formula for n = 1000.\n    alon_tarsi_number = n + 1\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final calculation and the result.\n    print(f\"For the graph K_{{{n},{n}}}, the value of n is {n}.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n    # The final equation with each number is printed below.\n    print(f\"AT(K_{{{n},{n}}}) = {n} + 1 = {alon_tarsi_number}\")\n\nsolve_alon_tarsi_knn()\n```\n<<<1001>>>"
