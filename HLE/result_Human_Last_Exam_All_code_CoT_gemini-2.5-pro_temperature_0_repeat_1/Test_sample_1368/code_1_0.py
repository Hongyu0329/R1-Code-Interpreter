    # The plan is to construct two perpendicular diameters.

    # Step 1: Draw a line through the center (P0) and the given point (P1)
    # to create the first diameter. This identifies the opposite point (P2).
    # Command: L

    # Step 2: Construct the perpendicular bisector of the first diameter.
    # This is done by drawing two circles of equal radius from the endpoints
    # of the diameter (P1, P2). The radius used is the radius of the
    # original circle (distance from P1 to P0).

    # from Step 2. This line is the second diameter, perpendicular to the first.
    # This identifies the final two vertices of the square.
    # Command: L
    step_3 = "L"

    # Step 4: Connect the four vertices of the square with four lines.
