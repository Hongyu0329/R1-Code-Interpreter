def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the mathematical problem about continua.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection of
    regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  A decomposable continuum must have at least one regular proper subcontinuum.
        So the cardinality is >= 1.
    2.  A proof by contradiction shows that the cardinality cannot be exactly 1.
        This means the cardinality must be >= 2.
    3.  An example can be constructed (the union of two indecomposable continua
        at a single point) which has exactly 2 regular proper subcontinua.

    Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
