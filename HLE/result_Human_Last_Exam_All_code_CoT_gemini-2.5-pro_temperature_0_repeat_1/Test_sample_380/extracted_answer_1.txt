You are correct that for AIC waves, which are field-aligned, using magnetic components perpendicular to the local magnetic field is the most physically accurate way to calculate normalized magnetic helicity. However, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral, so a calculation using components perpendicular to the radial direction is an approximation. This approximation is made for reasons of observational and computational convenience, as spacecraft data is provided in a fixed frame (like RTN or GSE), and analyzing long datasets is simpler without constantly transforming into a shifting field-aligned coordinate system.
