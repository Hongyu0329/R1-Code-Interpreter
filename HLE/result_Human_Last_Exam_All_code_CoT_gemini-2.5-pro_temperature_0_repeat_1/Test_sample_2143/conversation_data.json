    "Based on the clues provided, I will deduce the identity of \"HE\".\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues**: The prompt mentions a figure, \"HE,\" whose work includes a \"prohibition against representation\" and separately addresses \"another's material possessions.\"\n2.  **Identify the \"Prohibition against Representation\"**: This is a direct reference to the Second Commandment in the Decalogue (Ten Commandments), which forbids the creation of graven images or idols.\n3.  **Identify the \"Issue of Another's Material Possessions\"**: This refers to the Tenth Commandment, which prohibits coveting a neighbor's house, wife, servants, or property.\n4.  **Connect the Clues**: Both of these prohibitions are key parts of the Ten Commandments. The biblical figure who received and delivered these commandments to his people is Moses. Veronika Campan is a real scholar who has written about the Decalogue, lending credibility to this interpretation.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Therefore, \"HE\" is Moses. I will write a simple Python script to print his name.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the full name of the historical figure identified from the clues.\n# The clues point to the person who delivered the Ten Commandments.\n# - \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment.\n# - \"another's material possessions\" refers to the Tenth Commandment.\n# The figure associated with receiving and delivering these commandments is Moses.\n\nhis_full_name = \"Moses\"\nprint(his_full_name)\n```\n<<<Moses>>>"
