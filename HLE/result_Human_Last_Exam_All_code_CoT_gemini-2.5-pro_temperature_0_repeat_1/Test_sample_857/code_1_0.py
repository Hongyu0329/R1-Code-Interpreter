    # The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of the set of points
    # where a hereditarily decomposable continuum X fails to be coastal.
    # Let this set be NC(X). We want to find max(|NC(X)|).

    # Theorem 1: For a hereditarily decomposable continuum X, the set of its
    # non-coastal points is identical to the set of its endpoints, E(X).
    # So, |NC(X)| = |E(X)|.

    # Theorem 2: Any hereditarily decomposable continuum X has at most two endpoints.
    # So, |E(X)| <= 2.

    # From these theorems, it follows that |NC(X)| <= 2.

    # To show that 2 is the largest *possible* cardinality, we must confirm that
    # an example exists where the cardinality is exactly 2. The "double sin(1/x) curve"
    # is a hereditarily decomposable continuum with exactly two endpoints.

    # Therefore, the maximum possible cardinality is 2.
    largest_possible_cardinality = 2

    # We can express the final answer as an equation.
