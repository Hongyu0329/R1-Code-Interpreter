def solve_multiset_problem():
    """
    This script solves a three-part question about cross-intersecting multiset families.

    The solution is based on the following reasoning:
    The problem asks about sum-maximal cross 1-intersecting families F and G. A key consideration
    is whether the families are required to be non-empty. In extremal combinatorics, this is a
    standard assumption to avoid trivial solutions (where one family is empty and the other is the
    entire space). Under the non-empty assumption and the given condition m >= k+1, the
    Complete Cross-Intersection Theorem for multisets states that |F| + |G| is maximized
    if and only if F = G = F_i for some fixed element i, where F_i is the family of all
    k-multisets from [m] that contain the element i.

    This single principle allows us to answer all three parts of the question.

    # Part (a): Can F and G contain multisets with disjoint supports?
    #
    # Based on the theorem, for maximality, F = G = F_i. Every multiset in F_i contains
    # the element i. Therefore, the support of any multiset in F_i also contains i.
    # This means for any two multisets A, B in F_i, their supports cannot be disjoint
    # as they both contain {i}. The same logic applies to G.
    # Thus, neither F nor G can contain multisets with disjoint supports.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): If k = 2 and m = 5, what is |F| + |G|?
    #
    # The maximal sum is 2 * |F_i|. The size of F_i is the number of ways to choose
    # the remaining k-1 elements from m elements with repetition allowed.
    # The formula for this is the multiset coefficient C(m + (k-1) - 1, k-1).
    k = 2
    m = 5
    
    # The formula simplifies to C(m + k - 2, k - 1)
    n_comb = m + k - 2
    k_comb = k - 1
    size_F_i = math.comb(n_comb, k_comb)
    
    # The maximal sum is 2 times this value.
    answer_b = 2 * size_F_i

    # Part (c): Must F necessarily contain all k-multisets that include a
    # fixed element to achieve maximality?
    #
    # The "if and only if" part of the theorem is crucial here. It states that
    # maximality is achieved only when F = G = F_i. The family F_i is, by definition,
    # the family of *all* k-multisets containing the fixed element i.
    # Therefore, F must necessarily have this structure.
