    print(f"2. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient developed tachycardia (heart rate of {heart_rate} beats/min) and hypotension (blood pressure of {systolic_bp}/65 mm Hg). This indicates hemodynamic instability due to significant blood loss.")
    print(f"3. Evidence of Bleeding: The dramatic drop in hemoglobin from an initial {initial_hemoglobin} g/dL to {post_bleed_hemoglobin} g/dL confirms a major, acute hemorrhage.")
    print(f"4. Procedure Context: Splenic laceration is a known, albeit rare, complication of colonoscopy, particularly when the procedure is noted to be '{procedure_note}'. It can be caused by traction on the splenocolic ligament.")
    print(f"5. Ruling out other options: Postpolypectomy syndrome is impossible because a polypectomy was not performed ({polypectomy_performed}). Colonic perforation or lower GI bleeding are less likely to present with this specific combination of severe upper abdominal/shoulder pain and such a rapid, massive hemorrhage.")
