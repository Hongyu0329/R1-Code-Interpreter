    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe question asks for a specific piece of information from a famous ballet performance. The number of pirouettes in a variation is determined by the choreography. For Kitri's Act I variation in Don Quixote, there is a well-known and challenging sequence of turns. My plan is to write a Python script that stores this standard choreographic number in a variable and then prints it in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors\n    from the fifth position in Kitri's Act I variation from Don Quixote.\n    This is a standard piece of choreography for the role.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The standard choreography for this famous sequence calls for 16 pirouettes.\n    number_of_pirouettes = 16\n\n    # The final equation is simply the number itself.\n    # We will print the result in a clear statement.\n    print(f\"In the Act I variation of Don Quixote, the Kitri dancer traditionally performs a sequence of {number_of_pirouettes} single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
