    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure, we first need to determine the overall extent of the figure in the x and y directions. This means finding the minimum and maximum values for x and y.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the first part of the curve:** For `t` in `[0, π]`, where `x = cos(t)` and `y = sin(t)`. We will find the minimum and maximum x and y values for this segment. This corresponds to the upper half of a unit circle.\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the curve:** For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, where `x = cos(t)` and `y = 5*sin(t)`. We will find the minimum and maximum x and y values for this segment. This corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse.\n3.  **Combine the results:** We will take the overall minimum and maximum x and y values from both parts to define a bounding rectangle for the entire figure.\n4.  **Determine the square's side length:** The side length of the smallest enclosing square will be the larger of the width and height of the bounding rectangle.\n5.  **Calculate the area:** The area is the square of the side length.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given parametric curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the curve for t in [0, pi]\n    # x = cos(t), y = sin(t)\n    # For x = cos(t), max is at t=0 (cos(0)=1), min is at t=pi (cos(pi)=-1)\n    # For y = sin(t), max is at t=pi/2 (sin(pi/2)=1), min is at t=0,pi (sin(0)=sin(pi)=0)\n    x_max_1 = 1\n    x_min_1 = -1\n    y_max_1 = 1\n    y_min_1 = 0\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the first part of the curve (t in [0, pi]):\")\n    print(f\"  x = cos(t) ranges from {x_min_1} to {x_max_1}\")\n    print(f\"  y = sin(t) ranges from {y_min_1} to {y_max_1}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the curve for t in (pi, 2*pi)\n    # x = cos(t), y = 5*sin(t)\n    # For x = cos(t), max is at t=2pi (cos(2pi)=1), min is at t=pi (cos(pi)=-1)\n    # For y = 5*sin(t), max is at t=pi,2pi (5*sin(pi)=0), min is at t=3pi/2 (5*sin(3pi/2)=-5)\n    x_max_2 = 1\n    x_min_2 = -1\n    y_max_2 = 0\n    y_min_2 = -5\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the second part of the curve (t in (pi, 2*pi)):\")\n    print(f\"  x = cos(t) ranges from {x_min_2} to {x_max_2}\")\n    print(f\"  y = 5*sin(t) ranges from {y_min_2} to {y_max_2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the overall bounding box for the entire figure\n    x_min = min(x_min_1, x_min_2)\n    x_max = max(x_max_1, x_max_2)\n    y_min = min(y_min_1, y_min_2)\n    y_max = max(y_max_1, y_max_2)\n\n    print(\"Finding the overall bounding box:\")\n    print(f\"  Overall x-range: [{x_min}, {x_max}]\")\n    print(f\"  Overall y-range: [{y_min}, {y_max}]\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the width and height of the bounding box\n    width = x_max - x_min\n    height = y_max - y_min\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the dimensions of the bounding rectangle:\")\n    print(f\"  Width = {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}\")\n    print(f\"  Height = {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square\n    side_length = max(width, height)\n    \n    print(\"Determining the side length of the smallest enclosing square:\")\n    print(f\"  Side length = max(width, height) = max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 6: Calculate the area of the square\n    area = side_length ** 2\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the final area:\")\n    print(f\"  Area = side_length * side_length\")\n    print(f\"  Area = {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}\")\n\nsolve_area()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
