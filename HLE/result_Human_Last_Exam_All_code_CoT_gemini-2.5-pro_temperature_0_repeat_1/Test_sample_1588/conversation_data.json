    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of a specific order in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree `n` in `k` generators, which corresponds to the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order `n`, is given by Witt's formula:\n\n`L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} (μ(d) * k^(n/d))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order (degree), which is 10 in this case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators (X and Y), so `k=2`.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the code:\n1.  Set `n = 10` and `k = 2`.\n2.  Find all positive divisors of `n`.\n3.  For each divisor `d`, calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`.\n    *   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n    *   `μ(d) = (-1)^p` if `d` is a product of `p` distinct primes.\n4.  Calculate each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)` in the sum.\n5.  Sum all the terms and divide by `n` to get the final result.\n6.  Print the full equation with all the calculated numbers, as well as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coeffs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order n in the BCH expansion\n    for k generators using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order n={n} for k={k} generators.\")\n    print(\"Using Witt's formula: L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} (mu(d) * k^(n/d))\")\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The divisors of {n} are: {divisors}\")\n\n    total_sum = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power_val = k**(n // d)\n        term = mu_d * power_val\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        # Build the string for each term in the sum\n        part_str = f\"({mu_d} * {k}^{n//d})\"\n        equation_parts.append(part_str)\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n\n    # Build the full equation string\n    sum_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(\"\\nStep-by-step calculation:\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( {sum_str} )\")\n    \n    # Show the evaluated terms\n    evaluated_parts = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power_val = k**(n // d)\n        term = mu_d * power_val\n        evaluated_parts.append(str(term))\n    \n    evaluated_sum_str = \" + \".join(evaluated_parts).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( {evaluated_sum_str} )\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( {total_sum} )\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = {result}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(result)\n\n\nsolve_bch_coeffs()\n<<<99>>>\n```"
