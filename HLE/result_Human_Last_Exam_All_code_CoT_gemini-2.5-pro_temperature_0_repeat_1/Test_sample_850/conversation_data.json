    "The user's question contains a fundamental contradiction based on the principles of crystallography and optics. Here is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** A material is optically active if it can rotate the plane of polarized light. The primary requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be **chiral**.\n2.  **Chirality:** A crystal is chiral if its structure is not superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal class must lack any roto-inversion symmetry elements. Roto-inversion axes (`-n`) include a center of inversion (`-1`) and mirror planes (`m`, which is equivalent to `-2`).\n3.  **Achirality:** An **achiral** crystal is the opposite of a chiral one. It *does* possess at least one roto-inversion symmetry element (a center of inversion or a mirror plane).\n4.  **The Contradiction:** The question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral** but also have the symmetry for **optical activity**. As explained, optical activity requires chirality. Therefore, a crystal class cannot be both achiral and optically active; these two properties are mutually exclusive.\n\nBecause of this contradiction, the set of crystal classes that satisfies all the requested conditions is empty. The following Python code demonstrates this by defining the sets of crystal classes for each property and finding their intersection.\n\n```python\ndef find_contradictory_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies crystal classes based on a set of properties\n    and demonstrates the contradiction in the user's request.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 32 crystal classes, identified by their Hermann-Mauguin symbols.\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m',\n        '-3m', '4', '-4', '4/m', '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '6', '-6', '6/m',\n        '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432', '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Property 1: Achiral classes.\n    # These are classes that are NOT chiral.
