# Define the base and the exponent for the calculation.
# The base is the number of possible outcomes for a single player in Team B.
# A player in Team B plays 8 games, so they can win 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 games.
# This gives 9 possible scores.
base = 9

# The exponent is the number of players in Team B.
exponent = 6

# Calculate the total number of different sequences.
# This is base raised to the power of the exponent.
result = base**exponent

# Print the final equation showing the base, exponent, and the result.
print(f"The number of different sequences is calculated by the equation:")
print(f"{base}^{exponent} = {result}")
