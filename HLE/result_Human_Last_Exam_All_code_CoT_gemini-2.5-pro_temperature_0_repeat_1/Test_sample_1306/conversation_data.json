    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of irreducible representations and the total number of indecomposable representations for the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the key parameter:** The representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity depends on the parameter $\\ell$, which is the smallest positive integer such that $q^{2\\ell}=1$. Since $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (e.g., $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$), $q^2$ is also a primitive third root of unity. Therefore, $\\ell=3$.\n\n2.  **Address the scope of the category C:** The category of *all* finite-dimensional indecomposable representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ contains infinitely many non-isomorphic objects. This is because there exists a continuous family of indecomposable modules of dimension $\\ell=3$ parameterized by the complex projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$. If we were to consider all objects, the number of irreducible ones would be finite (just 2, as we will see), while the total number is infinite. The percentage would thus be 0. This suggests that the question likely refers to a more specific, finite collection of representations.\n\n3.  **Focus on the principal block:** A standard and natural choice is to consider the *principal block* of the representation category. This block contains the trivial representation and is the most studied part of the category. It contains a finite number of indecomposable objects. We will assume that $C$ refers to the category of indecomposable representations in the principal block.\n\n4.  **Count the objects in the principal block:** For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with parameter $\\ell$, the principal block contains two families of indecomposable objects:\n    *   **Irreducible (or simple) modules:** These are denoted $L_n$ for $1 \\le n < \\ell$. For $\\ell=3$, we have $L_1$ and $L_2$. The number of irreducible objects is $\\ell - 1$.\n    *   **Projective indecomposable modules:** Each simple module $L_n$ has a projective cover $P_n$, which is indecomposable but reducible. For $\\ell=3$, we have $P_1$ and $P_2$. The number of these modules is also $\\ell - 1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the percentage:**\n    *   Number of irreducible objects = $\\ell - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n    *   Total number of indecomposable objects in the principal block = (Number of irreducibles) + (Number of projectives) = $(\\ell - 1) + (\\ell - 1) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n    *   The percentage of irreducible objects is the ratio of the number of irreducible objects to the total number of indecomposable objects, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the parameter l for the quantum group.\n# q is a primitive third root of unity, so the order of q^2 is l=3.\nl = 3\n\n# Step 2: Count the number of irreducible objects in the principal block.\n# These are the simple modules L_n for 1 <= n < l.\nnum_irreducible = l - 1\n\n# Step 3: Count the total number of indecomposable objects in the principal block.\n# These consist of the simple modules and their projective covers.\n# There are (l-1) simple modules and (l-1) projective indecomposable modules.\ntotal_indecomposable = 2 * (l - 1)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the percentage.\npercentage = (num_irreducible / total_indecomposable) * 100\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and the equation.\nprint(\"Assuming C is the principal block of the category of representations:\")\nprint(f\"The parameter l is: {l}\")\nprint(f\"Number of irreducible objects = l - 1 = {num_irreducible}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of indecomposable objects = 2 * (l - 1) = {total_indecomposable}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe percentage of irreducible objects is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_irreducible} / {total_indecomposable}) * 100 = {percentage}%\")\n\n```\n<<<50.0>>>"
