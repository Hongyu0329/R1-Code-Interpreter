# Step 1: Define the parameter l for the quantum group.
# q is a primitive third root of unity, so the order of q^2 is l=3.
l = 3

# Step 2: Count the number of irreducible objects in the principal block.
# These are the simple modules L_n for 1 <= n < l.
num_irreducible = l - 1

# Step 3: Count the total number of indecomposable objects in the principal block.
# These consist of the simple modules and their projective covers.
# There are (l-1) simple modules and (l-1) projective indecomposable modules.
total_indecomposable = 2 * (l - 1)

# Step 4: Calculate the percentage.
percentage = (num_irreducible / total_indecomposable) * 100

# Step 5: Print the result and the equation.
