def solve_identifiability_question():
    """
    Analyzes strategies for mitigating identifiability issues in birth-death models
    and identifies the one that does not help.

    The core problem: For a phylogeny containing only extant species (a timetree),
    it is impossible to uniquely determine both the time-varying speciation rate lambda(t)
    and the time-varying extinction rate mu(t). As shown by Louca and Pennell (2020),
    an infinite number of different {lambda(t), mu(t)} pairs can result in the exact
    same likelihood for the given tree. This is the identifiability issue.

    A strategy to "mitigate" this issue must therefore either:
    1. Add new data/information that can distinguish between the rates (e.g., fossils, priors).
    2. Re-parameterize the model to focus only on parameter combinations that are identifiable
       (e.g., the pulled diversification rate).

    # Analysis of the options:
    # A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces:
    #    This simplifies the rate functions but does not solve the core problem. Within each
    #    of the 10 time intervals, lambda and mu remain unidentifiable. It doesn't add
    #    information or re-parameterize to an identifiable quantity.

    # B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework:
    #    This HELPS. Priors add external information that constrains the possible values
    #    of lambda and mu, making the estimation more stable and mitigating identifiability.

    # C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5:
    #    This does NOT help. The identifiability problem is caused by the model being too
    #    flexible for the data. This strategy introduces extreme flexibility and a large
    #    number of parameters without adding any new information. This will worsen the
    #    identifiability problem, not mitigate it. One could find many different
    #    polynomials that fit the data equally well.

    # D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors in the phylogeny:
    #    This HELPS. Fossils provide direct evidence of extinct lineages, breaking the
    #    symmetry of the problem and allowing for the separate estimation of lambda and mu.

    # E. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate:
    #    This HELPS. The pulled diversification rate (lambda(t) - mu(t)) is one of the
    #    parameter combinations that has been shown to be identifiable. Focusing on what
    #    can be identified is a key mitigation strategy.

    # F. Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny:
    #    This HELPS. Same reason as D; fossils provide crucial information about extinction.

    # G. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate:
    #    This HELPS. Similar to E, the pulled speciation rate is another identifiable
    #    parameter combination.

    # Conclusion:
    # Strategy C is the only one that actively works against solving the problem by
    # introducing massive, unconstrained flexibility. While strategy A also doesn't solve
    # the problem, strategy C is a much clearer example of a method that does not help
    # mitigate the issue.
