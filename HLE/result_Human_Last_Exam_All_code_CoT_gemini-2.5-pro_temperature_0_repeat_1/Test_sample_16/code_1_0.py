def solve_prototypes_problem():
    """
    This function determines the minimum number of prototypes required for a
    distance-weighted soft-label kNN classifier to correctly classify all
    class centroids.

    The reasoning is based on a logical proof rather than a numerical computation.

    Let C be the number of classes.
    Let P be the number of prototypes.

    1. Lower Bound (P must be at least C):
       - Assume P < C. By the pigeonhole principle, if you have C centroids (pigeons)
         and P nearest-prototype regions (pigeonholes), at least two centroids
         (e.g., Centroid_i and Centroid_j) must share the same nearest prototype (p_k).
       - For a k=1 NN classifier, both Centroid_i and Centroid_j would be assigned a
         label based on p_k's soft label. The predicted class for both would be
         the same: argmax(L_pk).
       - Since i is not equal to j, this single prediction cannot be correct for both.
         Therefore, at least one centroid is guaranteed to be misclassified.
       - To avoid this, we must have at least as many prototypes as classes. So, P >= C.

    2. Upper Bound (P = C is sufficient):
       - We can demonstrate that C prototypes are sufficient with a constructive strategy.
       - Place one prototype, p_i, exactly at the location of each class centroid,
         Centroid_i, for i = 1, ..., C.
       - The soft label for prototype p_i will be dominated by class i, as it is
         infinitely closer to Centroid_i than to any other centroid.
       - When classifying Centroid_j, the nearest prototype is p_j. In the
         distance-weighted kNN calculation, the weight for p_j (w_j = 1/distance)
         will be infinitely larger than the weights for all other prototypes.
       - This ensures that the final predicted soft label is dominated by p_j's
         soft label, which correctly points to class j.
       - This holds for any k and any configuration of centroids. Thus, P = C is sufficient.

    Conclusion:
    From the lower bound (P >= C) and the upper bound (P <= C), we conclude that
    the minimum number of prototypes required is exactly C.
