The matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for all Slater determinants $|\Phi_I\rangle$ with an excitation level of seven or greater. They are also zero for any determinant that does not share the same spin and spatial symmetries as the reference determinant $|\Phi\rangle$.
