# Description: This script analyzes the given options to find the correct "True Avalanche".
# A "True Avalanche" must fit the description and have repeated syllables.
# The core word is "computer" (syllables: com-pu-ter).
# The description is: "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."

    # Analysis for Choice A
    print("Choice A: " + choices['A'])
    print("  - Description Fit: Poor. It does not mention birds or the act of relieving.")
    print("  - Avalanche Fit: Weak. 'comp few urns' is not a clear phonetic repetition of 'computers'.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Analysis for Choice B
    print("Choice B: " + choices['B'])
    print("  - Description Fit: Excellent. A 'computer' instructs a 'tern' (a bird) to 'poo'.")
    print("  - Avalanche Fit: Excellent. The phrase 'Come poo, tern' is a strong phonetic pun on 'com-pu-ter'.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Analysis for Choice C
    print("Choice C: " + choices['C'])
    print("  - Description Fit: Good. It involves a computer telling a 'turkey' to 'pee'.")
    print("  - Avalanche Fit: Poor. The syllables in 'Come, pee you turkey' do not match 'com-pu-ter'.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Analysis for Choice D
    print("Choice D: " + choices['D'])
    print("  - Description Fit: None. 'Comb pewter' is unrelated to the description.")
    print("  - Avalanche Fit: Good, as 'Comb pewter' is a pun on 'computer', but it fails the description criterion.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Analysis for Choice E
    print("Choice E: " + choices['E'])
    print("  - Description Fit: Weak. It's a literal, awkward sentence, not a pun.")
    print("  - Avalanche Fit: None. There is no repetition of syllables.")
    print("-" * 40)

    print("Conclusion: Choice B is the only one that satisfies both the description and the avalanche definition.")
