    # The problem defines N as the minimum size of a set S for which an instance
    # with the "local-max" property exists.
    # The local-max property requires the existence of a k such that:
    # score(C, k-1) = 1
    # score(C, k+1) = 1
    # score(C, k) = 2

    # From score(C, k+1) = 1, we know there is a (k+1)-clustering.
    # The size of the set S must be at least (k+1) * L.
    # N >= (k+1) * L

    # To minimize N, we must minimize k.
    # The problem involves a (k-1)-clustering, so k-1 >= 1, which means k >= 2.
    # The smallest possible value for k is 2.
    # Assuming an instance with k=2 exists, it will lead to a smaller N than any instance with k > 2.
    # Therefore, the instances C in Q (the set of instances with size N) will have k=2.
    k = 2

    # For an instance C with k=2, we have:
    # C_{k-1} is a 1-clustering. It has one cluster, A1, which is the entire set S.
    # C_{k+1} is a 3-clustering. It has three clusters, B1, B2, and B3.
    # Each of these clusters must have at least L points.
    # |B1| >= L, |B2| >= L, |B3| >= L.

    # w_C is the maximum number of overlapping points between a cluster from C_{k-1} and C_{k+1}.
    # w_C = max_{A in C_{k-1}, B in C_{k+1}} |A intersect B|
    # Since C_{k-1} only has one cluster A1 = S, this simplifies to:
    # w_C = max(|S intersect B1|, |S intersect B2|, |S intersect B3|)
    # Since B1, B2, B3 are subsets of S, the intersection is just the cluster itself.
    # w_C = max(|B1|, |B2|, |B3|)

    # We know |B1| >= L, |B2| >= L, |B3| >= L.
    # Therefore, w_C must be at least L.
    min_w_C = L

    # The problem asks for min_{C in Q} w_C.
    # Based on our reasoning, any C in Q will have k=2, which leads to w_C >= L.
    # The minimum value is thus L.
    
    # The final equation is simply the result of this logical deduction.
    # We are calculating min_w_C = L
    final_answer = min_w_C
