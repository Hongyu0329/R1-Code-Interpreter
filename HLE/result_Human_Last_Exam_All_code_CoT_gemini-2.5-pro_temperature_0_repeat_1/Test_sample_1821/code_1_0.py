    # Step 1 & 2: Define the problem.
    # We need to find the number of cardinalities in the interval [min_branches, max_branches].
    # min_branches is the minimal possible number of branches for a pruned tree of height omega_2
    # with countably infinite levels.
    # max_branches is the maximal possible number.

    # Step 3: Determine the maximal number of branches.
    # The maximum number of branches is the number of functions from omega_2 to omega.
    # This is omega^omega_2, which equals 2^omega_2.
    max_branches = "2^omega_2"

    # Step 4: Determine the minimal number of branches.
    # A lower bound is established by partitioning branches by their level-0 node.
    # Since there are omega nodes at level 0 and each must belong to at least one branch,
    # there must be at least omega branches.
    # A construction is provided in the explanation showing a tree with exactly omega branches.
    min_branches = "omega"

    # Step 5: Count the cardinalities in the interval [omega, 2^omega_2].
    # The number of cardinal numbers less than or equal to an infinite cardinal 'lambda' is 'lambda' itself.
    # The number of cardinals in the interval is (number of cardinals <= 2^omega_2) - (number of cardinals < omega).
    # This is 2^omega_2 - omega, which simplifies to 2^omega_2.
    num_cardinalities = "2^omega_2"

    print("The number of cardinal numbers in this interval is given by the cardinal 2^omega_2.")
    
    # The prompt asks to output numbers in the final equation.
