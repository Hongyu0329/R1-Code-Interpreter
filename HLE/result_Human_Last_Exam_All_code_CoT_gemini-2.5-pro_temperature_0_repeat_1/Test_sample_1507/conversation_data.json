    "The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer-hull of a great icosahedron. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve this geometric problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Outer-Hull\":** The \"outer-hull\" of a non-convex polyhedron like the great icosahedron is its convex hull. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that encloses the object.\n2.  **Determine the Shape of the Convex Hull:** The vertices of a great icosahedron are arranged in the same way as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, the convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n3.  **Analyze the Faces of the Resulting Shape:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid, and its surface is composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n4.  **Find the Minimal Triangulation:** The question asks for the minimal number of triangles to triangulate this surface. Since the surface of a regular icosahedron is already perfectly covered by 20 triangles, this is already the minimal triangulation.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The number of triangles is simply the number of faces of a regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\nThe following Python code defines this number and prints it as the solution.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the number of triangles on the surface of the\n# convex hull of a great icosahedron.\n\n# Step 1: The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron,\n# as they share the same vertex arrangement.\n\n# Step 2: A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.\n# All of its faces are triangles.\n\n# Step 3: Since the surface is already composed of triangles, the minimal\n# number of triangles needed for triangulation is simply its number of faces.\nnumber_of_faces_on_icosahedron = 20\n\n# The final equation is: Number of Triangles = 20\n# We will print the number that solves this equation.\nprint(\"The minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation is:\")\nprint(number_of_faces_on_icosahedron)\n```\n<<<20>>>"
