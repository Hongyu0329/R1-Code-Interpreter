To first order in the epsilon expansion ($\epsilon = 4-d$), the quantitative scaling is given by the formula $\alpha \approx \frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}(4-d)$, where N is the number of components of the scalar field. For the common Ising model case (N=1), this simplifies to $\alpha \approx \frac{1}{6}(4-d)$.
