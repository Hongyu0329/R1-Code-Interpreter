    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** The user wants to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. The 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n2.  **Relate Different DFTs:** The 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence `y(n)`, let's call it `Z(k)`, is defined as:\n    `Z(k) = sum_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * exp(-j * 2 * pi * n * k / 4)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    This is equivalent to taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. Let `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. Then `Z(k) = Y(2k)`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the 8-point DFT:** The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` of the interleaved sequence `y(n)` can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`. The relationship is derived from the decimation-in-time FFT algorithm structure:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`, where `W_8^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 8)`.\n\n4.  **Derive the Final Formula:** By substituting `2k` for `k` in the formula for `Y(k)`, we can directly find `Z(k)`:\n    `Z(k) = Y(2k) = X((2k) mod 4) + W_8^(2k) * H((2k) mod 4)`\n    Simplifying the twiddle factor `W_8^(2k)`:\n    `W_8^(2k) = exp(-j * 2 * pi * (2k) / 8) = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 4) = W_4^k`\n    So, the final formula is:\n    `Z(k) = X((2k) mod 4) + W_4^k * H((2k) mod 4)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** We will use the given `X(k)` and `H(k)` values and the formula above to compute `Z(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`. The Python code below will perform these calculations and print each step.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 4-point DFT of an interleaved 8-point sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=complex)\n    H = np.array([0, 1+1j, 1, 1-1j], dtype=complex)\n\n    # The resulting 4-point DFT\n    Z = np.zeros(4, dtype=complex)\n    N = 4\n\n    print(\"The 4-point DFT Z(k) of the interleaved sequence is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"Z(k) = X((2*k) % 4) + exp(-j*2*pi*k/4) * H((2*k) % 4)\\n\")\n\n    for k in range(N):\n        # Twiddle factor W_4^k\n        W = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k / N)\n        # Index for X and H, which is (2*k) mod 4\n        idx = (2 * k) % N\n        \n        # Calculate Z(k)\n        Z[k] = X[idx] + W * H[idx]\n        \n        # Format the numbers for clear output\n        w_str = f\"({W.real:.2f}{W.imag:+.2f}j)\"\n        x_val_str = f\"({X[idx].real:.2f}{X[idx].imag:+.2f}j)\"\n        h_val_str = f\"({H[idx].real:.2f}{H[idx].imag:+.2f}j)\"\n        \n        # Clean up small floating point errors for the final result\n        z_real = round(Z[k].real, 2)\n        z_imag = round(Z[k].imag, 2)\n        z_val_str = f\"({z_real:.2f}{z_imag:+.2f}j)\"\n        \n        print(f\"For k = {k}:\")\n        print(f\"  Z({k}) = X({idx}) + (W_4^{k}) * H({idx})\")\n        print(f\"       = {x_val_str} + {w_str} * {h_val_str}\")\n        print(f\"       = {z_val_str}\\n\")\n\n    # Final result array\n    final_Z = [complex(round(z.real, 2), round(z.imag, 2)) for z in Z]\n    print(\"The final result for the 4-point DFT Z(k) is:\")\n    print(f\"Z = {final_Z}\")\n\nsolve_dft()\n<<<[1+0j, -1-1j, 1+0j, -1+1j]>>>\n```"
