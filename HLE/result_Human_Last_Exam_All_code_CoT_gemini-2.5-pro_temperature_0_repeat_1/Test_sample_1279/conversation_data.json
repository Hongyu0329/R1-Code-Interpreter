    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I will identify all the distinct Feynman diagrams for vacuum-to-vacuum transitions at the second order in $\\lambda\\phi^4$ theory. These are known as second-order vacuum bubbles.\n2.  There are three such diagrams: one fully connected diagram (often called the \"figure-8\" diagram), another connected diagram with tadpoles (the \"coathanger\" diagram), and one disconnected diagram composed of two first-order bubbles.\n3.  Next, I will calculate the symmetry factor for each of these three diagrams. The symmetry factor, S, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which is the number of ways the internal lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the structure of the diagram.\n4.  For the \"figure-8\" diagram, I'll consider the permutations of its two vertices and four identical propagators.\n5.  For the \"coathanger\" diagram, I'll consider the permutations of its vertices, the two connecting propagators, and the symmetries of the tadpole loops.\n6.  For the disconnected diagram, the symmetry factor is calculated based on the symmetry of its identical components (the first-order bubble) and the permutation of these components.\n7.  Finally, I will sum the individual symmetry factors to get the total. The Python script will perform these calculations and print out each step and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# In phi-4 theory, the interaction vertex involves 4 fields. Second-order diagrams\n# involve two such vertices. We need to find all possible ways to connect the\n# 8 legs (4 from each of the two vertices) to form vacuum diagrams (no external lines).\n# There are three distinct topologies.\n\n# --- Calculation for Diagram 1: The \"Figure-8\" Diagram ---\n# This diagram has two vertices and four propagators connecting them directly.\n# The symmetry factor is calculated by considering the permutations that leave the\n# diagram unchanged.\n# 1. Permuting the two identical vertices: This is a factor of 2.\n# 2. Permuting the four identical propagators connecting the vertices: This is a factor of 4! (4 factorial).\ns1_vertices = 2\ns1_propagators = math.factorial(4)\ns1 = s1_vertices * s1_propagators\n\n# --- Calculation for Diagram 2: The \"Coathanger\" Diagram ---\n# This diagram has two vertices. Each vertex has one self-loop (a tadpole),\n# and two propagators connect the two vertices.\n# 1. Permuting the two identical vertices (along with their attached tadpoles): Factor of 2.\n# 2. Permuting the two identical propagators that connect the vertices: Factor of 2.\n# 3. Flipping the ends of the first tadpole loop (a propagator starting and ending on the same vertex): Factor of 2.\n# 4.

Permuting the two identical loops: Factor of 2.\n# 2. Flipping the ends of the first loop: Factor of 2.\n# 3.
