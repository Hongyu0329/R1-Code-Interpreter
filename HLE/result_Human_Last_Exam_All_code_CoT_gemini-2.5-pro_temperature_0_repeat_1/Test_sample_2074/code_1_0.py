# Based on the derivation, the complex expression for l(b) simplifies to a constant value.
# The main steps of the derivation are:
# 1. The space of matrices for the infimum, Image(f), is the set of all 101x101 Symmetric Positive-Definite (SPD) matrices.
# 2. The expression to be minimized for a given SPD matrix S is:
#    min_k (k * nu_k + sum_{i=k+1 to 101} nu_i)
#    where nu_i are the eigenvalues of X + I, and X = S * C(b) * S.
# 3. Substituting nu_i = mu_i + 1, where mu_i are the eigenvalues of X, the expression becomes:
#    min_k (k * mu_k + sum_{i=k+1 to 101} mu_i + 101)
# 4. The infimum of the term involving mu_i over all SPD matrices S is 0. This can be seen by taking S -> 0.
# 5. Therefore, l(b) = 0 + 101 = 101, for any b in (-1, 1).

# Define the value of l(b) based on the derivation
l_b = 101

# The problem asks for l(1/2) and l(-1/2).
# Since l(b) is a constant, their values are the same.
l_half = l_b
l_neg_half = l_b

# The final expression to compute is 6 * (l(1/2) + l(-1/2))
c = 6
val1 = l_half
val2 = l_neg_half

# Calculate the final result
result = c * (val1 + val2)

# Print the components of the final equation as requested
print(f"The derived value of l(b) is a constant: {l_b}")
print(f"Therefore, l(1/2) = {val1}")
print(f"And l(-1/2) = {val2}")
print(f"The expression to compute is: {c} * ({val1} + {val2})")
print(f"The final result is: {result}")

# The final answer in the required format
print(f"<<<{result}>>>")
