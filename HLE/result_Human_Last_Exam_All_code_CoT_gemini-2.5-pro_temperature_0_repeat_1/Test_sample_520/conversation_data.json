Then, as requested, I will write a Python script that stores this profession in a variable and prints it in a full sentence to answer your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the true profession of Andre Vernault.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Andre Vernault's true profession was concealed due to its nature.\n    true_profession = \"undertaker\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a descriptive sentence.\n    print(f\"During World War II, Andre Vernault concealed his true profession from British counterintelligence.\")\n    print(f\"His true profession was an: {true_profession}\")\n\nfind_profession()\n```\n<<<undertaker>>>"
