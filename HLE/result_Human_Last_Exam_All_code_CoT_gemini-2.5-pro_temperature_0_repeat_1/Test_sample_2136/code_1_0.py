# Step 1: Define the problem parameters from the text.
# The PDE is u_t + 4*u*u_x - 3*u_xx = 0.
# We are looking for the value of the integral of (u_t)^2 over all space.
# We are given conditions at a stationary point x_0 and time tau.
# u_x(x_0, tau) = -1
# u(x,t) < 3/2

# Step 2: Analyze a stationary solution u_s(x), where u_t = 0 for all x and t.
# The PDE becomes the ODE: 4*u_s*u_s' - 3*u_s'' = 0.
# Integrating once gives: 3*u_s' = 2*(u_s)^2 + A, where A is a constant.

# Step 3: Use the given conditions to find the constants for a potential stationary solution
# that matches the snapshot of the bi-soliton at t=tau.
# Let u_s(x_0) = C and u_s'(x_0) = -1.
# Substituting into the integrated ODE: 3*(-1) = 2*C^2 + A  => A = -3 - 2*C^2.
# The ODE is 3*u_s' = 2*(u_s)^2 - (3 + 2*C^2).

# Step 4: The solution to this ODE is of the form u_s(x) = -k * tanh(B*(x-x_1)).
# For this form, the equation becomes 3*u_s' = 2*((u_s)^2 - k^2).
# Comparing gives k^2 = (3 + 2*C^2) / 2.
# The derivative is u_s'(x) = -k*B*sech^2(B*(x-x_1)).
# At the center of the kink (x=x_1), u_s = 0. If we assume the stationary point x_0 is this center, then C=0.
# If C = 0, then k^2 = 3/2, so k = sqrt(3/2).
# The ODE is 3*u_s' = 2*(u_s)^2 - 3.
# The derivative of the tanh solution at the center is u_s'(x_0) = -k*B. From the ODE form, B = 2k/3.
# So, u_s'(x_0) = -k * (2k/3) = -2*k^2/3.
# We are given u_x(x_0, tau) = -1. So, -2*k^2/3 = -1 => k^2 = 3/2.
# This is consistent with C=0.

# Step 5: Check the upper bound condition.
# The solution is u_s(x) = -sqrt(3/2) * tanh(sqrt(2/3)*(x-x_0)).
# The maximum value of this solution is k = sqrt(3/2).
k = np.sqrt(1.5)
# The upper bound from the problem is 3/2 = 1.5.
upper_bound = 1.5
# We check if k < upper_bound.
# k is approx 1.225, which is less than 1.5. The condition is satisfied.

# Step 6: Conclude the value of the integral.
# We have found a stationary solution u_s(x) that satisfies all the given local conditions
# for the bi-soliton solution at t=tau.
# Let's assume that at t=tau, the profile of the bi-soliton solution is exactly this stationary solution,
# i.e., u(x, tau) = u_s(x).
# The time derivative u_t is given by the PDE: u_t = 3*u_xx - 4*u*u_x.
# If u(x, tau) = u_s(x), then at t=tau:
# u_t(x, tau) = 3*u_s''(x) - 4*u_s(x)*u_s'(x).
# By definition, a stationary solution satisfies 3*u_s'' - 4*u_s*u_s' = 0 for all x.
# Therefore, u_t(x, tau) = 0 for all x.

# Step 7: The integral is then the integral of 0^2.
integral_value = 0

# The final equation is simply that the integral is zero.
# We print the numbers involved in reaching this conclusion.
