    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to a military conflict between the Ming Dynasty of China and Vietnam. The general in question is Mu Sheng (沐晟). This points towards the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), led by the future Vietnamese emperor Lê Lợi against Ming rule.\n2.  **Pinpoint the Specific Battle:** While Mu Sheng was involved in several campaigns, his first major, personal defeat occurred in 1426. After an earlier Ming army was destroyed at the Battle of Tốt Động-Chúc Động, Mu Sheng advanced with his own forces. He was ambushed and decisively defeated by the Vietnamese forces at the Battle of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá.\n3.  **Locate the Modern-Day Province:** The historical sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá are located in what is now Thanh Hóa Province in Vietnam. This province was the heartland of the Lam Sơn Uprising.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_province_of_defeat():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the current Vietnamese province\n    where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The historical event is the Battle of Lãnh Câu-Đan Xá in 1426,\n    # during the Lam Sơn Uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n    # Historical sources place the location of this battle in the region\n    # that corresponds to a specific modern Vietnamese province.\n    province = \"Thanh Hóa Province\"\n    \n    print(f\"Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred in the area of modern-day: {province}\")\n\nfind_province_of_defeat()\n```\n<<<Thanh Hóa Province>>>"
