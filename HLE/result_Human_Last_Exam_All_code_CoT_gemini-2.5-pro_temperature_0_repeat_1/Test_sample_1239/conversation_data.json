    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of space, time, and the fields (velocity and pressure) that leave the form of the equations unchanged. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters (or generators) for these transformations.\n\nThe symmetry analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations reveals the following independent transformations:\n\n1.  **Time Translation**: The laws of physics are the same at all times. This corresponds to shifting the time coordinate $t \\rightarrow t + \\epsilon$. This is a one-parameter group, contributing 1 to the dimension.\n2.  **Space Translations**: The equations are invariant under a shift of the spatial origin $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$. Since we are in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this provides 3 independent translations (along the x, y, and z axes), contributing 3 to the dimension.\n3.  **Space Rotations**: The equations are isotropic, meaning they are invariant under rotations of the spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, where $R$ is a rotation matrix. The group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$, is 3-dimensional (e.g., rotations about the x, y, and z axes). This contributes 3 to the dimension.\n4.  **Galilean Boosts**: These transformations correspond to shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame: $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. This requires a corresponding change in pressure. In 3D, there are 3 independent velocity boosts, contributing 3 to the dimension.\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation)**: The equations are invariant under a specific scaling of all variables:\n    $t \\rightarrow \\lambda^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n    This is a one-parameter family of transformations (parameterized by $\\lambda$), contributing 1 to the dimension.\n\nThe total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of these independent symmetries. The following Python code calculates this sum.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dimensions of the various independent symmetry transformations\n    time_translation_dim = 1\n    space_translation_dim = 3\n    space_rotation_dim = 3\n    galilean_boost_dim = 3\n    scaling_dim = 1\n\n    # The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these transformations.\n    total_dimension = (time_translation_dim +\n                       space_translation_dim +\n                       space_rotation_dim +\n                       galilean_boost_dim +\n                       scaling_dim)\n\n    print(\"The total dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is the sum of the dimensions of its components:\")\n    print(f\"- Time translations: {time_translation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"- Space translations: {space_translation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"- Space rotations: {space_rotation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"- Galilean boosts: {galilean_boost_dim}\")\n    print(f\"- Scaling transformations: {scaling_dim}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final dimension is calculated by summing these individual dimensions:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with each number, as requested.\n    print(f\"{time_translation_dim} + {space_translation_dim} + {space_rotation_dim} + {galilean_boost_dim} + {scaling_dim} = {total_dimension}\")\n\ncalculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
