    "To find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction, we first need to locate the singularity on a suitable model of the curve over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Find a suitable model and its special fiber.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\nThis equation defines a model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. To find the special fiber, we reduce the equation modulo 2. The residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n$z^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x^5 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + 1 \\pmod 2$\n$z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$\nThis is equivalent to $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe special fiber is a \"double line\" at $z=1$. This is a non-reduced, singular scheme.\n\n**Step 2: Center the model at a singular point.**\nThe singular locus is the entire line $z=1$. Let's pick a point on this line, for example, $(x,z)=(0,1)$, which is a point on the curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We perform a change of variables to move this point to the origin. Let $y = z-1$.\nSubstituting $z = y+1$ into the original equation:\n$(y+1)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$y^2 + 2y + 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$y^2 + 2y = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\nThis new model is centered at $(x,y)=(0,0)$. Its special fiber is $y^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, which is a double line through the origin.\n\n**Step 3: Approximate the curve locally.**\nThe thickness of the singularity is a local property. Near the singular point $(x,y)=(0,0)$, the term $2x^5$ is of higher order than the term $2x^3$ (with respect to the 2-adic valuation). We can thus approximate the local behavior of our genus 2 curve by the singularity of the genus 1 curve (an elliptic curve):\n$y^2 + 2y = 2x^3$\nTo analyze this singularity, we can write it in the standard Weierstra√ü form.\n$(y+1)^2 - 1 = 2x^3$\nLet $Y = y+1$. The equation becomes:\n$Y^2 = 2x^3 + 1$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the singularity of the approximating elliptic curve.**\nWe now analyze the stable reduction of the elliptic curve $E: Y^2 = 2x^3 + 1$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The type of reduction is determined by the 2-adic valuation of its discriminant.\nThe discriminant of an elliptic curve in the form $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ is $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$. For our curve $Y^2 = 2x^3+1$, we first need to transform it. Let $x' = \\sqrt[3]{2} x$. Then $Y^2 = (x')^3+1$. This is not over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nLet's use the general formula for $y^2=f(x)$. The discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)=2x^3+1$ is $\\text{Disc}(f) = -27 \\cdot a_0^2 a_3^2 + \\dots = -27 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot 2^2 = -108$.\nThe discriminant of the curve is $\\Delta_E = 2^{2(2g+1-1)} \\text{Disc}(f) = 2^{4g} \\text{Disc}(f)$. For an elliptic curve $g=1$, so $\\Delta_E = 16 \\cdot \\text{Disc}(f) = 16 \\cdot (-108) = -1728 = -2^6 \\cdot 3^3$.\nThe 2-adic valuation is $v_2(\\Delta_E) = 6$.\nHowever, the model $Y^2=2x^3+1$ is not minimal. We perform a change of variables $Y=4Y', x=2X'$.\n$(4Y')^2 = 2(2X')^3+1 \\implies 16(Y')^2 = 16(X')^3+1$. This is not integral.\nLet's try $Y=Y', x=2X$. $Y^2 = 2(8X^3)+1 = 16X^3+1$.\nLet's try $Y=Y', x=X/2$. $Y^2 = 2(X/2)^3+1 = X^3/4+1 \\implies 4Y^2=X^3+4$. Let $Y_1=2Y$. $Y_1^2=X^3+4$.\nThe discriminant of $Y_1^2=X^3+4$ is $\\Delta = -16(4 \\cdot 0^3 + 27 \\cdot 4^2) = -16 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 16 = -432 \\cdot 16 = -6912 = -2^8 \\cdot 27$.\nThe 2-adic valuation is $v_2(\\Delta)=8$.\nThe change of variables was $x=X/2, Y=Y_1/2$.\nThe original model is $Y^2=2x^3+1$.\nUsing Tate's algorithm, for $Y^2=2x^3+1$, we have $a_1=a_2=a_3=0, a_4=0, a_6=1$.\n$v_2(a_i)$ are all $\\ge 0$. $v_2(2)=1$.\n$\\Delta = -16(4(2)^3) - 27(1)^2) = -16(32+27) = -16(59)$.\n$v_2(\\Delta)=4$.\nThis model is minimal. According to Tate's algorithm, a minimal model with $v_2(\\Delta)=4$ corresponds to a reduction of type $I_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Relate reduction type to thickness.**\nA singularity of type $I_n$ (a multiplicative reduction) corresponds to a stable model which has a node (a double point). The thickness of this node is precisely $n$.\nSince the approximating elliptic curve has a reduction of type $I_4$, the thickness of its double point is 4. As this curve models the local behavior of the original genus 2 curve, we conclude that the thickness of the double point in the stable reduction of $z^2=2*x^5+2*x^3+1$ is 4.\n\nThe following python code calculates the relevant discriminant and its 2-adic valuation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = abs(n)\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n       factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\n# For the elliptic curve Y^2 = 2*x^3 + 1, which is of the form Y^2 = a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d\n# The coefficients are a=2, b=0, c=0, d=1.\n# This is not a standard Weierstrass form.\n# We can transform it to y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B form, but it's easier to use the general discriminant formula for a cubic.\n# For f(x) = a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d, the discriminant is\n# Disc(f) = b^2*c^2 - 4*a*c^3 - 4*b^3*d - 27*a^2*d^2 + 18*a*b*c*d\na = 2\nb = 0\nc = 0\nd = 1\n\n# Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial f(x) = 2*x^3 + 1\ndisc_poly = b**2 * c**2 - 4 * a * c**3 - 4 * b**3 * d - 27 * a**2 * d**2 + 18 * a * b * c * d\n# disc_poly = 0 - 0 - 0 - 27 * (2**2) * (1**2) + 0\n# disc_poly = -27 * 4 = -108\n\n# The discriminant of the curve y^2 = f(x) is related to the discriminant of the polynomial f(x).\n# For y^2 = ax^3+d, the discriminant is -27*a*d^2 * (-16a) = 432 a^2 d^2?
