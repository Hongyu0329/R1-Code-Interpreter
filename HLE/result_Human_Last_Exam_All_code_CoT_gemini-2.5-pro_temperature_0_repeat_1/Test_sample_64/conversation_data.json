    "My plan is to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (otouto) and then represent this information using a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and Pronunciation**: The word is 「弟」, pronounced \"otouto\". It consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n2.  **Recall/Look up the Accent Pattern**: The standard pitch accent for 「弟」 is noted as [0]. This notation signifies the \"Heiban\" (平板) pattern.\n3.  **Define Heiban Pattern**: In a Heiban pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and then remains high for the rest of the word and any following particles. For \"otouto\", this would be o(low) to(high) u(high) to(high).\n4.  **Match with Answer Choices**: The Heiban pattern corresponds to answer choice A.\n5.  **Create a Python Script**: I will write a simple Python script that stores this information in a dictionary and prints the result for the user. This fulfills the requirement of providing a coded solution.\n\n```python\ndef get_pitch_accent_info(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the standard pitch accent for a given Japanese word\n    by looking it up in a predefined dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pitch accent database\n    # [0] = Heiban, [1] = Atamadaka, etc.\n    accent_data = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"reading\": \"おとうと (otouto)\",\n            \"pattern_type\": \"Heiban\",\n            \"pattern_code\": \"[0]\",\n            \"description\": \"The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high.\",\n            \"pitch_visualization\": \"お(↓) と(↑) う(→) と(→)\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    if word in accent_data:\n        info = accent_data[word]\n        print(f\"Word: 「{word}」\")\n        print(f\"Reading: {info['reading']}\")\n        print(f\"Standard Pitch Accent Pattern: {info['pattern_type']} {info['pattern_code']}\")\n        print(f\"Description: {info['description']}\")\n        print(f\"Visualization: {info['pitch_visualization']}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Pitch accent information for 「{word}」 is not available.\")\n\n# The word in question\ntarget_word = \"弟\"\nget_pitch_accent_info(target_word)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
