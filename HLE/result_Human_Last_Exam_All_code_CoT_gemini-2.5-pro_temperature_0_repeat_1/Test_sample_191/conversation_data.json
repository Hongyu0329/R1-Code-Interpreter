    "My plan is to first identify the specific protein involved in the process of macrophage engulfment of amyloid plaques. Based on my knowledge, this process involves the complement system, a part of the immune system. I will then create a Python script that stores the name of this protein in a variable and prints a clear, descriptive answer explaining its role.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the role of a key protein\n    in the macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary protein involved is part of the complement system.\n    protein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n    \n    # The breakdown of this protein creates a product that tags amyloid.\n    breakdown_product = \"C3b\"\n    \n    # Print the explanation of the biological process.\n    print(f\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is {protein_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Specifically, the breakdown of {protein_name} generates fragments, most notably {breakdown_product}.\")\n    print(f\"This {breakdown_product} fragment acts as an opsonin, which 'tags' the surface of amyloid plaques.\")\n    print(\"This tag is then recognized by receptors on macrophages and microglia, signaling them to engulf and clear the amyloid.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
