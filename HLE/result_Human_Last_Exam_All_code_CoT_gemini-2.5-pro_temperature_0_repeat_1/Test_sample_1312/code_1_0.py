    1. Limited recombination (e.g., in asexual organisms) leads to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, a process called Muller's Ratchet.
    2. A compensatory mechanism must counteract this accumulation.
    3. Polyploidy, the state of having multiple complete sets of chromosomes, provides massive gene redundancy across the entire genome.
    4. If a deleterious mutation occurs in one copy of a gene, other functional copies on the other chromosome sets can mask its effect.
    5. This genome-wide buffering is a powerful mechanism to prevent the rapid genetic deterioration predicted by Muller's Ratchet and is a common feature of successful ancient asexual lineages.
    6. While multigene families (D) also provide redundancy, polyploidy (E) is a more global and impactful architectural feature that serves this compensatory role.
