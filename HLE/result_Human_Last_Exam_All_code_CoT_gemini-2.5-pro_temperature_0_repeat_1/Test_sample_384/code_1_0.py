Step 1: Evaluating the plausibility of each option.
Options B, C, and D (Censorship/Redaction): These are highly plausible. Transcribers censoring "inappropriate" content (B), protecting a political figure's reputation (C), or an intelligence agency redacting active techniques (D) are all logical actions within the historical context.
Options E, F, and G (Technical/Practical Reasons): These are also plausible. The use of invisible ink (E), symbols as mnemonic aids for oral tradition (F), or simple physical wear and tear on a popular section (G) are all practical and historically sound explanations for missing text.
Option H (Esoteric Misinterpretation): While speculative, the idea of misinterpreting esoteric symbols (H) fits with the mystical aspects often associated with ninjutsu.

Step 2: Identifying the least plausible option.
Option A suggests the author, Fujibayashi, compiled the work and then erased a section to discredit it. This is logically flawed. An author seeking to discredit a topic would more likely omit it entirely rather than include it and then conspicuously erase it. The act of leaving placeholders (the circles) draws attention to the missing text, implying it is important or sensitive, which directly contradicts the goal of discrediting it. This makes the author's supposed action inconsistent with his motive.

Step 3: Conclusion.
Option A is the least plausible because the described action is counter-intuitive to the stated goal.
