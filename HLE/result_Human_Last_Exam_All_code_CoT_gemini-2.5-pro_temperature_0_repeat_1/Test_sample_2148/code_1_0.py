# Step 1: Define the given constants for neutrinos
c_V = 0.5
c_A = 0.5

# Step 2: Calculate the term (c_V^2 + c_A^2) which appears in both X1 and X2
c_V_sq_plus_c_A_sq = c_V**2 + c_A**2

# Step 3: Calculate X1 and X2 based on the derived formulas
# From the problem description and standard decay formulas, we derive:
# X1 = 2 * sqrt(2) * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
# X2 = (c_V^2 + c_A^2) / (12 * sqrt(2) * pi)

X1 = 2 * math.sqrt(2) * c_V_sq_plus_c_A_sq
X2 = c_V_sq_plus_c_A_sq / (12 * math.sqrt(2) * math.pi)

# Step 4: Calculate the product X1 * X2
# X1 * X2 = (2*sqrt(2)*(c_V^2+c_A^2)) * ( (c_V^2+c_A^2)/(12*sqrt(2)*pi) )
# This simplifies to (1 / (6*pi)) * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)^2
# With c_V=1/2 and c_A=1/2, (c_V^2+c_A^2) = 1/2.
# So, X1 * X2 = (1 / (6*pi)) * (1/2)^2 = 1 / (24*pi)
X1_times_X2 = X1 * X2

# Step 5: Calculate the final result, which is the inverse of the product
# (X1 * X2)^-1 = (1 / (24*pi))^-1 = 24*pi
result = 1 / X1_times_X2

# Step 6: Print the final equation and its components as requested
# The final equation is result = 24 * pi
term1 = 24
