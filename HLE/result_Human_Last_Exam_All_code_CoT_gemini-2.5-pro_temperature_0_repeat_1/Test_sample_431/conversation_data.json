    "To determine the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker of the human GABAAρ1 receptor, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Fetch Protein Data**: I will use the canonical amino acid sequence for the human GABAAρ1 receptor (Gene: `GABRR1`, UniProt ID: `P24046`).\n2.  **Identify Domain Boundaries**: Based on the UniProt annotation, the transmembrane domains (TM) are located at specific positions. The TM3-TM4 linker is the intracellular loop region between the end of TM3 and the beginning of TM4.\n    *   TM3 (Transmembrane domain 3) ends at residue position 311.\n    *   TM4 (Transmembrane domain 4) starts at residue position 433.\n    *   Therefore, the TM3-TM4 linker spans from residue 312 to 432.\n3.  **Extract Linker Sequence**: I will write a Python script to slice the full protein sequence to isolate the TM3-TM4 linker domain (residues 312-432).\n4.  **Count Cysteine Residues**: The script will then iterate through this extracted linker sequence to find and count all occurrences of the Cysteine ('C') amino acid.\n5.  **Display Results**: The code will print the positions of each Cysteine found and then display the final count as a sum, fulfilling the requirement to show the numbers in the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_cysteine_in_linker():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker\n    of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor (UniProt: P24046).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The full canonical amino acid sequence for human GABAAρ1 receptor (UniProt P24046)\n    protein_sequence = \"MGFALWLLWALALLGVLSESYSQLQMHNPARVGLGVTTVNLTMTTLTISDMSWLPEDTTFTFNADGPVNDTLSISVTSDGIKVLFRVFPFDEQNCSMVFGSWTPDTFFRNGKSAVHMTMPNLFLRLNNLMVSIETISLTTFGYTMSNLTPEKVATSYTPNLALVYNWTIDQKVAFPDALYYVNCSYFNLSPHVVFTALDFQLRKYWVEKKIDIFIHSGERRVAFYGIYIWLIYLPLVFLSVNVLGLSPNFGGQKKSVEVQRHKEFSTKHTTNPYAKMSIWYYIATCYLFLVIVFASLLYEFAVNYIFFSRGAYEPDIATMYTLCFLFRNSVTGAPIAPLNLVFPDVSSVCMNLEHFRRKRRHYHHTCCPRAPSPKASKASPLPQRASLIQKSRAIARKILADKVFVITTLILSTLSISARNSLPKVAYATAMDWFIAVCYAFVFSALIEFATVNYFTKRGYAWDGKSVVPEKPKKVKDPLIKKNQTYIP\"\n\n    # The TM3-TM4 linker is defined as the region between TM3 and TM4.\n    # TM3 ends at residue 311.
