    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the weights** of the ambient space, which are given as $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n2.  **Determine the degree `d`** of the quasi-homogeneous polynomial. A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if every monomial term has the same weighted degree. We can calculate this degree from the terms in the given equation. For instance, for the term $z_5^3$, the weighted degree is $3 \\times w_5 = 3 \\times 75 = 225$. For the term $z_1^8z_3$, the weighted degree is $8 \\times w_1 + 1 \\times w_3 = 8 \\times 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$. We can confirm that all terms (barring a likely typo in the second term) have a weighted degree of 225. Thus, the degree of the polynomial is $d=225$.\n3.  **Calculate the sum of the weights**, $\\sum w_i$.\n4.  **Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant** using its definition: $c = d - \\sum w_i$.\n5.  **Print the final calculation and result**. The fact that the link is a Calabi-Yau implies that the invariant should be 0, as the Calabi-Yau condition for a hypersurface is $d = \\sum w_i$. Our calculation will verify this.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient space\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The degree 'd' of the quasi-homogeneous polynomial.\n    # For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree is equal to the sum of the weights.\n    # We can also calculate it from the monomials, e.g., for z_5^3:\n    # d = 3 * 75 = 225\n    # Or for z_1^8*z_3:\n    # d = 8 * 22 + 1 * 49 = 176 + 49 = 225\n    d = 225\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the weights\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # The Crawley-Nordström invariant is defined as c = d - sum(weights)\n    invariant = d - sum_of_weights\n\n    # Print the components of the calculation\n    print(f\"The degree of the polynomial is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The sum of the weights is {weights[0]} + {weights[1]} + {weights[2]} + {weights[3]} + {weights[4]} = {sum_of_weights}.\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation and result\n    print(\"\\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is c = d - \\u03A3w\\u1D62\")\n    print(f\"c = {d} - {sum_of_weights}\")\n    print(f\"c = {invariant}\")\n    \n    # Output the final answer in the specified format\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{invariant}>>>\\n\")\n\nsolve_crawley_nordstrom()\n```"
