    """
    This function analyzes the provided multiple-choice question about RAR mutants.
    
    The analysis is based on the established principles of nuclear receptor biology:
    1.  RAR has separate domains for DNA binding (DBD) and ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (LBD).
    2.  A mutation in the LBD can abolish transcriptional activation without affecting the DBD's ability to bind DNA.
    3.  Therefore, it's possible for a mutant to bind to a gene's promoter but fail to activate its transcription.

    Based on this, Choice A is the most accurate description of a possible and well-documented experimental outcome.
    """
    
    # The correct answer choice based on biological principles.

    # Explanation for the choice.
    explanation = "Choice A accurately describes a key feature of modular proteins like RAR. The function of transcriptional activation (mediated by the LBD) can be disrupted by a mutation, while the separate function of DNA binding (mediated by the DBD) remains intact."
