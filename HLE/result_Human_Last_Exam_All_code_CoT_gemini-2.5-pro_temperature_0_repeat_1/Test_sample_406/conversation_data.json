    "Of course, I can help with that. Here are the conditions for a system of three functions to have a tripled fixed point.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Clarify the Concept:** First, I will explain what an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" means. It's a point `(x, y, z)` that remains unchanged when the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` are applied to it in a specific way.\n2.  **Correct Function Signatures:** The function signatures you provided (`G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`) seem to have a typo, as `G` is defined twice with different signatures. I will assume a more standard and symmetric form used in this field of mathematics:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × Z × X → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × X × Y → Z`\n3.  **State the Conditions:** The conditions for `(x, y, z)` to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are a system of three equations that must be satisfied simultaneously.\n4.  **Provide Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that prints these defining equations. This script will clearly state the conditions as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef print_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the system of equations that define an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n    This assumes a system of three functions F, G, and H with the\n    following standard signatures for a tripled fixed point problem:\n    F: X × Y × Z → X\n    G: Y × Z × X → Y\n    H: Z × X × Y → Z\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"For a point (x, y, z), where x is in set X, y is in set Y, and z is in set Z,\")\n    print(\"to be an FGH-tripled fixed point, it must satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # The system of equations defining the tripled fixed point\n    # Each variable (x, y, z) is output in the final equations.\n    equation1 = \"F(x, y, z) = x\"\n    equation2 = \"G(y, z, x) = y\"\n    equation3 = \"H(z, x, y) = z\"\n\n    print(f\"1. The output of function F must be equal to the first element of the triplet:\")\n    print(f\"   {equation1}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"2. The output of function G must be equal to the second element of the triplet:\")\n    print(f\"   {equation2}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"3. The output of function H must be equal to the third element of the triplet:\")\n    print(f\"   {equation3}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"In essence, the triplet (x, y, z) is a 'fixed point' for the combined operator (F, G, H).\")\n    print(\"The existence and uniqueness of such a point often depend on the properties of the sets (e.g., being complete metric spaces) and the functions (e.g., being contractive mappings).\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the conditions\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n```\n<<<A point (x, y, z) is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the system of equations: F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, z, x) = y, and H(z, x, y) = z.>>>"
