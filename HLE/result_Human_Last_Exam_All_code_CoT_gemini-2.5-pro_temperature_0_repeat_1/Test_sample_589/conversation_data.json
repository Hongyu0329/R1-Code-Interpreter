    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nHere is my plan to identify the film:\n1.  Analyze the key visual elements described in the user's request: a teenager, a pink bicycle, and an oncoming car (or large vehicle).\n2.  Search my knowledge base for scenes in major Hollywood films that match this specific and memorable combination of elements.\n3.  The scene in question is a surreal dream sequence. The protagonist, a teenager, finds himself riding a pink bicycle down a deserted street. He then pedals directly toward his school bus, which is being driven by the film's antagonist.\n4.  This sequence occurs in the 1985 horror film *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge*, produced and distributed by New Line Cinema.\n5.  I will provide a Python script that prints the name of this film.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_title():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and returns the title of the movie based on the described scene.\n    The scene involves a teenager on a pink bike riding towards an oncoming vehicle.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\"\n    print(movie_title)\n\nfind_movie_title()\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
