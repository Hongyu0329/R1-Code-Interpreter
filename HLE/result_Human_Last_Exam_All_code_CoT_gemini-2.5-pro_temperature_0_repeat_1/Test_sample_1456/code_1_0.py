    This function explains and provides the answer to the topological question.

    By a continuum we mean a compact connected metric space. What is the largest
    possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua?
    """

    # The number of composants of a continuum X depends on its decomposability.
    # 1. If X is decomposable, it has 1 composant.
    #    Example: The interval [0, 1] is decomposable.
    # 2. If X is indecomposable, it has 'c' composants, where 'c' is the
    #    cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).
    #    Example: The pseudo-arc is indecomposable.

    # A key theorem by R. H. Bing states that the product of two continua, X x Y,
    # is indecomposable if and only if both X and Y are indecomposable.

    # This leads to two cases for the product of two nondegenerate continua X and Y:
    # Case A: If at least one of X or Y is decomposable.
    #   - The product X x Y is decomposable.
    #   - The number of composants is 1.
    # Case B: If both X and Y are indecomposable.
    #   - The product X x Y is indecomposable.
    #   - The number of composants is 'c'.

    # The question asks for the largest possible number of composants.
    # Comparing the possible outcomes (1 and 'c'), the largest is 'c'.
