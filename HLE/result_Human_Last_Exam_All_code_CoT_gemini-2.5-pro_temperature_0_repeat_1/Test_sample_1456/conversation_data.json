    "This is a problem in point-set topology. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Define the Key Terms**: First, I need to be clear on the definitions of a continuum, a nondegenerate continuum, and a composant.\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   A **nondegenerate continuum** is a continuum containing more than one point.\n    *   The **composants** of a continuum are equivalence classes of points, where two points are in the same class if they are contained in some proper subcontinuum. The number of composants is the number of these classes.\n\n2.  **Relate Composants to Decomposability**: The number of composants is directly related to whether a continuum is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   A continuum is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant (the entire space itself). An example is the line segment `[0,1]`.\n    *   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable. A nondegenerate indecomposable continuum has **c** composants, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers, `2^ℵ₀`). An example is the pseudo-arc.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Space `X x Y`**: The question asks about the product of two nondegenerate continua, `X` and `Y`. The number of composants of `X x Y` depends on whether the product space is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n4.  **Apply the Key Theorem**: A crucial theorem by R. H. Bing states that the product `X x Y` is indecomposable if and only if **both** `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n5.  **Determine the Possibilities**:\n    *   **Case 1**: If at least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable (e.g., `X = [0,1]`), then by Bing's theorem, the product `X x Y` is also decomposable. In this case, `X x Y` has **1** composant.\n    *   **Case 2**: If both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable (e.g., both are pseudo-arcs), then by Bing's theorem, the product `X x Y` is also indecomposable. As a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum, `X x Y` has **c** composants.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua can be either 1 or **c**. The question asks for the *largest possible* number, which is **c**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the answer to the topological question.\n\n    By a continuum we mean a compact connected metric space.

If X is decomposable, it has 1 composant.\n    #    Example: The interval [0, 1] is decomposable.\n    # 2.

H. Bing states that the product of two continua, X x Y,\n    # is indecomposable if and only if both X and Y are indecomposable.\n\n    # This leads to two cases for the product of two nondegenerate continua X and Y:\n    # Case A: If at least one of X or Y is decomposable.\n    #   - The product X x Y is decomposable.\n    #   - The number of composants is 1.\n    # Case B: If both X and Y are indecomposable.\n    #   - The product X x Y is indecomposable.\n    #   - The number of composants is 'c'.\n\n    # The question asks for the largest possible number of composants.\n    # Comparing the possible outcomes (1 and 'c'), the largest is 'c'.\n\n    largest_number_of_composants = \"c (the cardinality of the continuum)\"\n\n    print(\"The largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is:\")\n    print(largest_number_of_composants)\n\nsolve_topology_question()\n```\n<<<c (the cardinality of the continuum)>>>"
