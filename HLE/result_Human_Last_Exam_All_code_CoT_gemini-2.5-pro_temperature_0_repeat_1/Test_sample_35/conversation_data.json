    "To determine the correct hand to shove all-in with, we need to analyze the situation and calculate the profitability of shoving each hand. This profitability is measured in Expected Value (EV).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Situation:** We have a 16 big blind (bb) stack in an early position (UTG+1) near the money bubble. The bubble pressure means our opponents will likely fold more often, only calling our all-in with a very strong, tight range of hands.\n2.  **Establish Assumptions:** To calculate the EV, we need to make some reasonable assumptions:\n    *   **Pot Size:** The blinds and antes in the pot before we act amount to roughly 2.5 bb.\n    *   **Opponent Calling Range:** A player choosing to call a 16bb shove from early position on the bubble will have a premium hand. We'll assume a tight range of `99+, AQs+, AKo`. This is about 4.5% of all possible hands.\n    *   **Probability of Getting Called:** With 7 players behind us, the chance that at least one of them has a hand in this tight range is approximately 27%. This means we will win the pot uncontested 73% of the time.\n    *   **Hand Equity:** We need to know our chance of winning if we are called. Against the `99+, AQs+, AKo` range, the equities are:\n        *   `AKo`: 49.5%\n        *   `99`: 45.4%\n        *   `AJo`: 30.5%\n        *   `QJs`: 34.5%\n3.  **Calculate Expected Value (EV):** The EV of shoving is calculated with the formula:\n    `EV = (Probability_everyone_folds * Pot_won) + (Probability_of_a_call * Value_when_called)`\n    Where `Value_when_called = (Our_Equity * Total_Pot) - Amount_Risked`\n4.  **Execute the Code:** The following Python code will perform these calculations for each hand option to see which shoves are profitable and which is best.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_ev():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Expected Value (EV) of shoving all-in for several poker hands.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Assumptions ---\n    our_stack_bb = 16\n    pot_size_bb = 2.5  # Blinds + Antes\n    \n    # Probability that all 7 opponents fold to our shove.\n    # Based on opponents calling with a tight 4.5% range (99+, AQs+, AKo)\n    # P(all fold) = (1 - 0.045)^7\n    prob_all_fold = 0.726\n    prob_gets_called = 1 - prob_all_fold\n    \n    # Total pot size when we get called by one player with a similar stack\n    total_pot_on_call_bb = our_stack_bb + our_stack_bb + pot_size_bb\n\n    # Hand options and their equity vs. the assumed calling range (99+, AQs+, AKo)\n    hand_options = {\n        \"E.
