    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum size of a set $A$ that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of the group $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to find the size of this set:\n1.  **Analyze the structure of cyclic subgroups in G.**\n    The group $G$ is an abelian group. The order of any element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ can be 1, 7, or 49. Consequently, the order of any element in $G$ must also be 1, 7, or 49.\n    A cyclic subgroup is generated by a single element $g \\in G$.\n    - If $g=0$, the subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$. To intersect with this, our set $A$ must contain the zero element, $0 \\in A$.\n    - If $g \\neq 0$, the order of $g$ is either 7 or 49.\n\n2.  **Find a common feature of all non-trivial cyclic subgroups.**\n    Let's consider the subgroup $G_7 = \\{x \\in G \\mid 7x = 0\\}$. This is the set of all elements in $G$ with order dividing 7. An element $(g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ is in $G_7$ if and only if $7g_i = 0$ for all $i$. In $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the elements killed by 7 are multiples of 7, i.e., $\\{0, 7, 14, \\dots, 42\\}$. This set forms a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $G_7$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This makes $G_7$ a vector space of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\n    Now, let's see how any non-trivial cyclic subgroup relates to $G_7$:\n    - If a cyclic subgroup is of order 7, say $\\langle g \\rangle$ with $\\text{ord}(g)=7$, then $g \\in G_7$. The entire subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ is contained in $G_7$.\n    - If a cyclic subgroup is of order 49, say $\\langle g \\rangle$ with $\\text{ord}(g)=49$, consider the element $h = 7g$. Since $7h = 49g = 0$ and $h \\neq 0$, the element $h$ has order 7. Thus, $h \\in G_7$. The subgroup $\\langle h \\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7 and is contained within $\\langle g \\rangle$. Moreover, it is the *unique* subgroup of order 7 within $\\langle g \\rangle$.\n\n    This means every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains exactly one cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n3.  **Reduce the problem.**\n    To ensure our set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup, we must have $0 \\in A$ for the trivial subgroup. For all non-trivial subgroups, it is sufficient to ensure that $A$ intersects every subgroup of order 7. Let $A' = A \\setminus \\{0\\}$. If $A'$ intersects every subgroup of order 7, it will intersect every non-trivial cyclic subgroup.\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum size of a set $A'$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n4.  **Count the number of subgroups to hit.**\n    The cyclic subgroups of order 7 are the 1-dimensional subspaces of the vector space $G_7 \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$.\n    The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q-1}$.\n    In our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$. So, the number of subgroups of order 7 is:\n    $N = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n5.  **Determine the minimum size of the hitting set.**\n    Let these $N$ subgroups of order 7 be $L_1, L_2, \\dots, L_N$. We need to find a set $A'$ of minimum size that has a non-empty intersection with each $L_i$.\n    Any two distinct subgroups of order 7, being distinct 1-dimensional subspaces, intersect only at the zero vector. This means the sets of their non-zero elements are disjoint.\n    An element $a \\in A'$ (where $a \\neq 0$) belongs to exactly one subgroup of order 7 (the one it generates). Therefore, to hit all $N$ distinct subgroups, we need at least $N$ distinct non-zero elements.\n    We can achieve this minimum by selecting exactly one non-zero element from each of the $N$ subgroups.\n    So, the minimum size of $A'$ is $N = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    The total size of $A$ is the size of $A'$ plus one (for the zero element).\n    $|A| = |A'| + 1 = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} + 1$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters from the problem.\n# The group is G = (Z/p^2 Z)^n where p=7 and n=2024.\np = 7\nn = 2024\n\n# The number of cyclic subgroups of order p is equal to the number of\n# 1-dimensional subspaces in an n-dimensional vector space over F_p.\n# The formula is (p^n - 1) / (p - 1).\n# We use integer division // as the result is guaranteed to be an integer.\nnum_subgroups_of_order_p = (p**n - 1) // (p - 1)\n\n# The smallest set A must contain one element for each of these subgroups,\n# plus one element for the trivial subgroup {0}.\nresult = num_subgroups_of_order_p + 1\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\n# The equation is (|A'|) + 1, where |A'| is the number of subgroups of order 7.\nprint(f\"The smallest size of A is calculated by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"({p}^{n} - 1) / {p - 1} + 1 = {result}\")\n```"
