    Calculates the ratio of completely split fibers to all fibers

    The problem asks for the ratio of "irreducible degree d points" to "all degree d points".
    As explained in the reasoning, this is interpreted as a question about the density of
    fibers of a map f: C -> P^1 with a certain property. The answer 1/|G| corresponds
    to the density of completely split fibers, suggesting a typo in the problem statement.

        G_size (int): The size of the Galois group G, denoted as |G|.
                      This must be a positive integer.
