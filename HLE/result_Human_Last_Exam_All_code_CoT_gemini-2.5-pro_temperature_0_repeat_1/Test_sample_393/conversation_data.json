    "The problem asks for the number of Tverberg partitions of a specially constructed set of $n$ points, $X$. The key information is that for this set $X$, *every* Tverberg partition results in the same set of part sizes, $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r\\}$. This simplifies the problem significantly. The geometric conditions (the set being in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and the size constraints $1 \\le a_i \\le d+1$) are there to guarantee that such a set $X$ exists. They do not, however, affect the counting process.\n\nThe problem is therefore reduced to a purely combinatorial one: \"How many ways can a set of $n$ distinct items be partitioned into subsets of sizes $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$?\"\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this combinatorial problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total number of items, n:** This is simply the sum of the sizes of all parts, $n = \\sum_{i=1}^r a_i$.\n2.  **Calculate the number of ways to form the partitions if the parts were distinguishable:** This is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n    $$ \\binom{n}{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r} = \\frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \\dots a_r!} $$\n3.  **Adjust for indistinguishable parts:** In a set partition, the order of the subsets does not matter. If some parts have the same size (e.g., two parts of size 3), they are indistinguishable. We must divide by the number of ways to permute these identical-sized subsets. If a size $s$ appears $k$ times, we divide by $k!$. We do this for all repeated sizes.\n4.  **Combine the steps:** The final formula is:\n    $$ \\text{Number of partitions} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{j} k_j!} \\times \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{i} a_i!} $$\n    where $k_j$ is the number of times the $j$-th distinct part size appears in the list $(a_1, \\dots, a_r)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. You can modify the `partition_parts` list to specify the partition you are interested in. The code will then calculate the result and show the steps of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_tverberg_partitions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to partition a set of n points into subsets\n    of specified sizes, which corresponds to the number of Tverberg partitions\n    for the specific set X described in the problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- User Input ---\n    # Define the partition a_1, a_2, ..., a_r here.\n    # This is a list of integers representing the sizes of the parts.\n    # Example: For a partition of n=7 into parts of size 3, 2, 2, use [3, 2, 2].\n    partition_parts = [3, 2, 2]\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n\n    # 1.
