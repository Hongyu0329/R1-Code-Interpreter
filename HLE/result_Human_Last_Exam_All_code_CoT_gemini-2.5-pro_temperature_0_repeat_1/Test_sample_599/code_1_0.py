# The problem is to find the 50th segmented number.
# Based on mathematical analysis, the segmented numbers are the powers of 2.
# The n-th segmented number is given by the formula 2^(n-1).

# We need to find the 50th element in this sequence.
n = 50

# The base of the power is 2.
base = 2

# The exponent is n - 1.
exponent = n - 1

# Calculate the 50th segmented number.
result = base ** exponent

# Print the final equation with all its components.
print(f"The {n}th segmented number is the result of the equation: {base}^{exponent}")
print(f"The final answer is: {result}")
