# The problem is to determine the quantity -u(0,1)/2.
# Based on the analysis, this quantity is equal to the expression 3 / (e^2 + 3).
# This script calculates the numerical value of this expression.

# The numbers that form the final equation are:
numerator = 3
power = 2
addend = 3

# We print the final equation to show how the result is derived.
# The equation shows each number used in the calculation.
print(f"Final equation: {numerator} / (e^{power} + {addend})")

# Calculate the result
result = numerator / (math.exp(power) + addend)

# Print the final numerical answer
print(f"Calculated value: {result}")
