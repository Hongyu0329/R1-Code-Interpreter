    """
    Analyzes the existence of a function f: [κ⁺]² -> κ with a specific property
    related to partition calculus for an infinite cardinal κ.
    """

    print("This is a problem in advanced set theory. The solution relies on established theorems rather than direct computation.")
    print("Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning:\n")

    print("--- The Problem ---")
    print("Let κ be an infinite cardinal. We are asked if there exists a function f: [κ⁺]² → κ such that for every subset x ⊆ κ⁺ with order type κ+1, the image of pairs from x has cardinality κ.")
    print("In symbols: for every x ⊆ κ⁺ with otp(x) = κ+1, does |f''[x]²| = κ hold?\n")

    print("--- Step 1: Rephrasing in Partition Calculus ---")
    print("The existence of such a function is equivalent to the negation of a partition relation.")
    print("The positive relation κ⁺ → (κ+1)²_{<κ} means that for ANY function f: [κ⁺]² → κ, there IS a set x with otp(x) = κ+1 such that |f''[x]²| < κ.")
    print("The question is therefore asking: For which κ does the negative relation κ⁺ ↛ (κ+1)²_{<κ} hold?\n")

    print("--- Step 2: The Case of Regular Cardinals ---")
    print("A cardinal κ is regular if cf(κ) = κ (e.g., ω, ω₁, ω₂).")
    print("A classic theorem by Erdős, Hajnal, and Rado states that for any regular cardinal κ:")
    print("Partition Relation for Regulars: κ⁺ → (κ+1)²_κ")
    print("This means for any function f: [κ⁺]² → κ, there exists a 'homogeneous' set x with otp(x) = κ+1.")
    print("Homogeneous means f is constant on all pairs from x. For this set x, the image size is |f''[x]²| = 1.")
    print("Since κ is infinite, 1 < κ. This violates the condition |f''[x]²| = κ.")
    print("Conclusion: For any regular cardinal κ, such a function can NEVER exist.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: The Case of Singular Cardinals ---")
    print("A cardinal κ is singular if cf(κ) < κ (e.g., ω_ω, ω_{ω+ω}).")
    print("For singulars, the answer is not absolute and depends on the model of set theory (i.e., it is independent of the standard ZFC axioms).")
    print("The answer depends on the relationship between 2^κ and κ⁺, a subject of Saharon Shelah's PCF theory.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: Shelah's Dichotomy for Singulars ---")
    print("Two key theorems by Shelah resolve the question:")
    print("Theorem 1: If κ is a singular cardinal and 2^κ = κ⁺, then the positive relation κ⁺ → (κ+1)²_{<κ} holds.")
    print("   - In this case, the function required by the problem does NOT exist.")
    print("Theorem 2: If κ is a singular cardinal and 2^κ > κ⁺, then the negative relation κ⁺ ↛ (κ+1)²_{<κ} holds.")
    print("   - In this case, a function with the required property DOES exist.\n")

    print("--- Step 5: Conclusion based on Independence ---")
    print("The axioms of ZFC do not decide whether 2^κ = κ⁺ or 2^κ > κ⁺ for a singular cardinal κ.")
    print(" - Model 1: In a model of ZFC + GCH (Generalized Continuum Hypothesis), we have 2^κ = κ⁺ for all κ. In this model, by Theorem 1, the function never exists for singulars.")
    print(" - Model 2: It is also consistent with ZFC to have, for example, κ = ω_ω and 2^κ = ω_{ω+2}. Here, 2^κ > κ⁺ (since κ⁺ = ω_{ω+1}). In this model, by Theorem 2, the function exists for κ = ω_ω.")
    print("\nBecause the existence of the function depends on which model of set theory we are in, the statement is independent of ZFC.")
