    This function determines the least dangerous path for the adventurer.

    The map shows the adventurer '@' and the gold 'g'.
    There are two primary ways to get from the adventurer's starting room to the gold's room:
    1. Go Left: This path leads through unlit hallways ('#').
    2. Go Down: This path leads into a room with a red dragon ('D').

    A red dragon is considered a much greater danger than an unlit hallway.
    Therefore, the safest (least dangerous) path is to avoid the dragon entirely.
    This is achieved by taking the path to the left.

    The problem asks for a simplified sequence of moves (U, D, L, R).
    Since the entire journey is in the left direction, the answer is 'L'.
