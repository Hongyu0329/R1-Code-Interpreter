    # --- Step 1: Identify the core legal issue ---
    # The central issue is a conflict of interest involving a former client.
    # NC LLP, the law firm, previously represented Advanced Tech Inc. (ATI) and now
    # seeks to represent Six Wings Inc. (SWI) in a matter directly adverse to ATI.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the duty to the former client ---
    # A law firm's duty of confidentiality to a client survives the termination of the relationship.
    # The firm, NC LLP, possesses highly sensitive information about ATI (financials, contracts, etc.)
    # that was obtained during the previous representation.

    # --- Step 3: Evaluate the new matter ---
    # The new matter is the acquisition of ATI by SWI. The confidential information the firm holds
    # is directly relevant to this transaction and could be used to the disadvantage of the
    # former client, ATI. This creates a substantial risk of prejudice and a clear conflict of interest.

    # --- Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on legal principles ---
    # A: Incorrect. The matters are considered "related" because the confidential information from the first is material to the second.
    # B: Incorrect. While firms use "ethical walls", they are not a substitute for client consent when a direct conflict exists. The primary remedy is consent from the prejudiced party.
    # C: Plausible, but not the most fundamental reason. The conflict exists because the firm owes a duty, regardless of the partners' specific access. The core issue is the duty itself, not just how information might flow.
    # E: Incorrect. This is an overstatement. Consent can often cure a conflict of interest.

    # --- Step 5: Conclude with the most accurate reason ---
    # D: Correct. This choice accurately identifies the fundamental rule. When a disqualifying conflict of interest exists, the lawyer or firm cannot act without the informed consent of the prejudiced party (the former client). The scenario explicitly states that ATI will not consent. Therefore, NC LLP is prohibited from continuing the representation.

    explanation = """
    The analysis of the legal scenario leads to the following conclusion:

    1.  A conflict of interest exists because NC LLP is representing a new client (Six Wings Inc.) in a matter that is directly adverse to a former client (Advanced Tech Inc.).
    2.  The firm possesses confidential information from the former client that is highly relevant to the new matter, creating a significant risk of prejudice to the former client.
    3.  In such a situation, the law firm can only proceed if it obtains informed consent from the party that would be prejudicedâ€”the former client, Advanced Tech Inc.
    4.  The problem explicitly states that Advanced Tech Inc. will not provide this consent.
    5.  Therefore, the absence of consent is the definitive reason why Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue representing Six Wings Inc.
