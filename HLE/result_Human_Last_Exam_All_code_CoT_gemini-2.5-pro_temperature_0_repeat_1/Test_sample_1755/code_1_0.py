    This function prints the corrected C code.
    The original code has two main issues:
    1. A type mismatch in scanf: It uses "%d" to read into a `char`, causing undefined behavior.
    2. Flawed loop logic: It uses `feof` incorrectly, leading to incorrect calculations at the end of the input.
    The corrected code reads the number of vectors 'n' and loops exactly 'n' times, which is the correct and robust way to solve the problem.
