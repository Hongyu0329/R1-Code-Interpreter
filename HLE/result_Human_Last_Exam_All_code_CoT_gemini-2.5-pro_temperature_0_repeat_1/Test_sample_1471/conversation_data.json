    "To solve the equation, I will first convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers and then perform the calculation.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Convert Roman Numerals:**\n    *   `CL` = 100 + 50 = 150\n    *   `CCC` = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300\n    *   `CCCLXXXI` = 300 + 50 + 30 + 1 = 381\n2.  **Rewrite the Equation:** The equation `CL/CCC - CCCLXXXI` becomes `150 / 300 - 381`.\n3.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    *   First, perform the division: `150 / 300 = 0.5`.\n    *   Next, perform the subtraction: `0.5 - 381 = -380.5`.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation and its solution.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers from the Roman numerals\nnum1 = 150  # CL\nnum2 = 300  # CCC\nnum3 = 381  # CCCLXXXI\n\n# Perform the calculation\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the equation in modern numbers and the result\nprint(f\"Equation: {num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-380.5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
