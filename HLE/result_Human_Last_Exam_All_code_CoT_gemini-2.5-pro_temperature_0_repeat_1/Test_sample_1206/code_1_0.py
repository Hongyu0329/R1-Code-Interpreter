    # Analysis of Option II
    print("Option II: 'It would be good for her son to start using nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges instead of vaping.'")
    print("Reasoning: This is a sound recommendation. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is a much safer method for nicotine delivery than vaping. It helps manage withdrawal symptoms and cravings without the harmful and unknown effects of inhaling vape aerosol, and it avoids the reinforcing behaviors of vaping. It is a standard tool used to help adolescents quit nicotine.")

    # Analysis of Option III
    print("Option III: 'Vapingâ€™s risks and benefits are well understood in adults, but not in children, so her son should not vape at all.'")
    print("Reasoning: This is a critical educational point. It correctly emphasizes that the adolescent brain and body are still developing and are uniquely vulnerable to the harms of nicotine and other chemicals in vapes. The long-term risks are unknown, and the primary goal for youth is complete cessation of all nicotine products.")

    # Conclusion
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The best counseling strategy combines the crucial educational message from Option III with the practical, safer alternative proposed in Option II.")
    print("This approach validates the mother's experience while clearly explaining why the situation is different and more dangerous for her son, and it offers a constructive path forward for his cessation journey.")
    print("Therefore, the combination of options II and III is the most appropriate choice.")
