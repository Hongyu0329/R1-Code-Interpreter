# The first block a player can obtain in this scenario is a Bone Block.
# This is achieved by collecting bones from skeletons and crafting them.
# The crafting recipe for a Bone Block requires 9 units of bone meal.

bone_meal_required = 9

# The final equation represents the crafting recipe for the block.
# We will print each component number of this equation.
