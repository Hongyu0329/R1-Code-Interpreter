    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Analyze the properties of the function `f`**\n    Let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n    *   **Injectivity:** If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is an injective function, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ is injective.\n\n    *   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. So, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n    *   **Composition Monotonicity:** The function $g(x) = f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing.\n        *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is consistent.\n        *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is also potentially consistent.\n\n2.  **Rule out the strictly decreasing case**\n    Suppose $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach some limit $L_1$ (which could be $-\\infty$).\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach some limit $L_2$ (which could be $+\\infty$).\n    *   Since $f$ is decreasing, $L_1 < L_2$. The range of $f$ is the interval $(L_1, L_2)$.\n    *   Let's look at the limits of $f(f(x))$:\n        *   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\exp(x) = \\infty$. Let $y = f(x)$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $y \\to L_1$. So, $\\lim_{y \\to L_1^+} f(y) = \\infty$. Since $f$ is decreasing, this can only happen if $L_1 = -\\infty$.\n        *   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$. Let $y = f(x)$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $y \\to L_2$. So, $\\lim_{y \\to L_2^-} f(y) = 0$. Since $f$ is decreasing and continuous, this implies $L_2$ must be a finite value, and if we could evaluate $f(L_2)$, it would be 0.\n    *   So, we have $L_1 = -\\infty$ and $L_2$ is a finite constant, let's call it $c$. The range of $f$ is $(-\\infty, c)$.\n    *   The composition $f(f(x))$ means we are applying $f$ to its own range. So, the domain for the outer $f$ is $(-\\infty, c)$. The range of $f \\circ f$ is $f((-\\infty, c))$.\n    *   Since $f$ is decreasing, its range on $(-\\infty, c)$ is $(\\lim_{y \\to c^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y))$.\n    *   We already found that $\\lim_{y \\to c^-} f(y) = 0$.\n    *   For a decreasing function $f$ with $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = c$, we have $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = c$.\n    *   So the range of $f \\circ f$ is $(0, c)$.\n    *   But the range of $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. So we must have $c = \\infty$. This contradicts the finding that $c$ must be finite.\n    *   Therefore, $f$ cannot be strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Analyze the strictly increasing case**\n    *   $f$ must be strictly increasing.\n    *   Does $f$ have any fixed points? If $f(x_0) = x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. So $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$. The equation $x=e^x$ has no real solutions. Thus, $f$ has no fixed points.\n    *   Since $f(x)-x$ is a continuous function with no roots, it must be either always positive or always negative.\n    *   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. But $f(f(x)) = e^x$, and $e^x > x$ for all real $x$. This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n    *   From $f(x) > x$ and $f$ being increasing, we have $f(f(x)) > f(x)$. So $e^x > f(x)$.\n    *   This gives us the bounds: $x < f(x) < e^x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n4.  **Construct the set of solutions**\n    A solution $f$ can be constructed by defining it on a specific interval and then extending its definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the functional equation. The construction reveals a set of choices that can be made freely.\n\n    *   Let's define $f$ on the interval $[0, 1]$. The values $f(x)$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$ will determine the function everywhere else.\n    *   For $x \\in [0, 1]$, $f(x)$ maps this interval to $[f(0), f(1)]$. Let's call $c_0 = f(0)$ and $c_1 = f(1)$.\n    *   The outer $f$ then maps the interval $[c_0, c_1]$ to $[f(f(0)), f(f(1))] = [e^0, e^1] = [1, e]$.\n    *   So, we have $f([0, 1]) = [c_0, c_1]$ and $f([c_0, c_1]) = [1, e]$.\n    *   From the bounds $x < f(x) < e^x$, we have:\n        *   $0 < f(0) < e^0 \\implies 0 < c_0 < 1$.\n        *   $1 < f(1) < e^1 \\implies 1 < c_1 < e$.\n    *   The construction of $f$ depends on three choices:\n        1.  The value of $c_0 = f(0)$, which can be any number in $(0, 1)$.\n        2.  The value of $c_1 = f(1)$, which can be any number in $(1, e)$.\n        3.  A continuous, strictly increasing bijection $h: [0, 1] \\to [c_0, c_1]$. This function defines $f$ on $[0, 1]$, so $f(x) = h(x)$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n    *   Once these choices are made, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For example, on $[c_0, c_1]$, $f$ is given by $f(y) = e^{h^{-1}(y)}$. This process can be continued to cover all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n5.  **Determine the cardinality**\n    The number of distinct functions $f$ is the number of ways we can make the above choices.\n    *   The number of choices for $c_0 \\in (0, 1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The number of choices for $c_1 \\in (1, e)$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The number of choices for the function $h$ (an increasing homeomorphism between two intervals) is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for each independent parameter: $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince the prompt requires a Python script as an answer, the following script will print the standard symbol for this cardinality.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the cardinality of the set of continuous functions\n    f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n\n    The mathematical analysis shows that such functions exist and that the set\n    of all such functions has the cardinality of the continuum. The continuum\n    is the size of the set of real numbers and is commonly denoted by 'c'.\n    \"\"\"\n    cardinality_symbol = 'c'\n    print(cardinality_symbol)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<c>>>"
