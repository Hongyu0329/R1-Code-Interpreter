    This function determines the value 'n' for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.

    The problem asks for the value of n such that a tame functor f from an upper semilattice J
    to the category of K-vector spaces is n-resolvable.

    1.  An n-resolvable functor is one with a projective dimension of at most n.
    2.  The category of functors from J is equivalent to the category of modules over the incidence algebra K[J].
    3.  A key theorem in representation theory states that the global dimension of the incidence algebra of any finite semilattice (upper or lower) is at most 2.
    4.  This means the projective dimension of any functor (or module) in this category is at most 2.
    5.  Therefore, any such functor is 2-resolvable. The condition "tame" is satisfied by this general result.

    The final answer is n = 2.
