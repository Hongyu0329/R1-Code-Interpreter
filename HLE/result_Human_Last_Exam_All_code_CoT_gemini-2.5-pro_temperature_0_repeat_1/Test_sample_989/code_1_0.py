    print("Analyzing the statements to find the false one:\n")

    # --- Statement A ---
    print("Statement A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.")
    print("Verdict: TRUE")
    print("Explanation: This is due to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions required for the SVM solution. One key condition is `sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0`, where `alpha_i` are the Lagrange multipliers (which are positive for support vectors) and `y_i` are the class labels (+1 or -1). If all support vectors belonged to a single class (e.g., all `y_i = +1`), this sum would be a sum of positive numbers and could not equal zero. Therefore, support vectors must come from both classes.\n")

    # --- Statement B ---
    print("Statement B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.")
    print("Verdict: TRUE")
    print("Explanation: This is the idea behind weighted or cost-sensitive SVMs. By applying different penalty parameters (C) to different classes, we can penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily. This shifts the decision boundary to better accommodate the imbalanced data, which is conceptually equivalent to creating unequal effective margins.\n")

    # --- Statement C ---
    print("Statement C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.")
    print("Verdict: TRUE")
    print("Explanation: This is the 'kernel trick'. For example, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel corresponds to a mapping into an infinite-dimensional feature space. However, we don't need to perform this mapping explicitly. We only need to compute the kernel function `K(x, z)`, which is computationally efficient.\n")

    # --- Statement D ---
    print("Statement D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.")
    print("Verdict: TRUE")
    print("Explanation: The SVM decision boundary is defined only by the support vectors (points on or within the margin). Interior points are correctly classified and lie outside the margin. Adding or moving such points (as long as they don't cross the margin) will not change the set of support vectors, and thus the decision boundary remains unaffected.\n")

    # --- Statement E ---
    print("Statement E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.")
    print("Verdict: FALSE")
    print("Explanation: This is a false mathematical statement. While a strictly convex function has at most one global minimizer (uniqueness), its existence is not guaranteed. A classic counterexample is the function f(x) = e^x. This function is strictly convex (its second derivative e^x is always positive), but it has no global minimum. It approaches an infimum of 0 as x approaches negative infinity, but it never reaches this value for any finite x.\n")

    print("Conclusion: The only statement that is not true is E.")
