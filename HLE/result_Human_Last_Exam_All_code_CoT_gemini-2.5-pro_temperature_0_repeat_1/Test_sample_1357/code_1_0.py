    # The problem asks for the number of combinatorial types of the stable reduction
    # of a genus 4 curve C, given that its Jacobian, J = Jac(C), has good reduction.

    # Step 1: A key theorem by Raynaud states that the special fiber of the NÃ©ron model
    # of J is the Jacobian of the stable reduction of C.

    # Step 2: The condition "J has good reduction" means its special fiber is an
    # abelian variety (i.e., it is smooth).

    # Step 3: The Jacobian of a stable curve is an abelian variety if and only if
    # the curve itself is smooth (i.e., has no nodes). If the curve were singular,
    # its Jacobian would be a semi-abelian variety with a non-trivial torus part,
    # and thus not an abelian variety.

    # Step 4: Combining these facts, since the special fiber of J is an abelian variety,
    # the stable reduction of C must be a smooth curve of genus 4.

    # Step 5: The "type" of a stable reduction refers to its combinatorial structure
    # (number of components and nodes). A smooth curve has one component and zero nodes.
    # This represents a single, unique combinatorial type.
