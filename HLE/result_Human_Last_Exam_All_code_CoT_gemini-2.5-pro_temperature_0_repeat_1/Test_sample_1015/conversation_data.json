    "My plan is to analyze the technical execution of a *cambré derrière* (a bend backwards) in two major ballet methodologies, Vaganova and Balanchine. I will compare the core principles of each style as they apply to this specific movement, focusing on aspects like posture, alignment, and dynamics. By highlighting the most significant technical distinction, I can determine the correct answer from the provided choices.\n\nI will create a Python script to structure this comparison. The script will define the key characteristics of the *cambré derrière* for each method and then print a detailed explanation of the primary difference, leading to the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef ballet_method_comparison():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the execution of a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    vaganova_technique = {\n        \"Method\": \"Vaganova\",\n        \"Hip Placement\": \"Hips must remain square and stable over the supporting legs.
