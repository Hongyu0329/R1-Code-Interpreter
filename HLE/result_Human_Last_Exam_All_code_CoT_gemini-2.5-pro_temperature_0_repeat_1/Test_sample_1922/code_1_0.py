The incorrect statement is B. Here is the reasoning:

R. A. Markus is a highly respected scholar of Augustine. While he provided a complex and nuanced analysis of Augustine's thought, the claim that he 'ignored his thoughts on predestination and grace' is false. These concepts are absolutely central to Augustine's later theology, and no serious scholarly work on the subject could or would ignore them. Markus's work, in fact, engages deeply with how Augustine's theological views, including grace, shaped his understanding of society and history. The other statements (A, C, D, E, F) represent accurate or standard scholarly interpretations of Augustine's philosophy and its reception.
