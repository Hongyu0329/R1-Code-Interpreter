    print("Postulate 1 (Principle of Relativity): The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.")
    print("Combined with assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime, this implies that the transformation between two inertial frames (S and S') moving at a relative velocity 'v' must be linear.")
    print("This line of reasoning leads to a general form for the transformations:")
    print("\nx' = gamma * (x - v*t)")
    print("t' = gamma * (t - v*x/K)")
    print("\nHere, 'gamma' is a factor that depends on 'v' and 'K'. The crucial part is the constant 'K', which must be a universal constant, the same in all frames.")
    print("The First Postulate alone does NOT determine the value of K.")

    # Step 2: Examine the possibilities for K.
    print("\nStep 2: What does the value of K mean?")
    print("The nature of our physical universe depends entirely on the value of K.")

    print("\nCase A: K tends to infinity")

    print("x' = x - v*t")
    print("t' = t")
    print("These are the Galilean transformations of classical mechanics. In this universe, there is no universal speed limit.")

    print("\nCase B: K is a finite, positive number")
    print("If K is a finite, positive constant, we have a universe with a special, invariant speed.")
    print("Let's call this invariant speed 'c', where K = c^2.")
    print("The velocity addition formula derived from these transformations is: u' = (u - v) / (1 - u*v/K)")
    print("If we set the speed u = c = sqrt(K), we find that u' is also c, meaning this speed is invariant.")
    print(f"Proof: u' = (c - v) / (1 - c*v/c^2) = (c - v) / (1 - v/c) = c*(c - v) / (c - v) = c")
    print("So, the existence of a finite, positive K implies the existence of a universal invariant speed.")

    # Step 3: The role of the Second Postulate.
    print("\nStep 3: The role of the Second Postulate.")
    print("The First Postulate leaves K undetermined. We need another physical principle to fix its value.")
    print("This is where the Second Postulate comes in.")
    print("\nPostulate 2: The speed of light in a vacuum, 'c', is the same in all inertial frames.")
    print("This postulate is a direct physical statement asserting that such an invariant speed exists, and it is the speed of light.")
    print("This allows us to set the unknown constant K equal to c^2.")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The Second Postulate is not superfluous. It is the essential piece of information that fixes the value of the universal constant K.")
