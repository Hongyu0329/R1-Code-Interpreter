    "To determine the number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables for the specified supersymmetric sigma-model, we need to find the dimension of the bosonic part of the relevant target space.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the model:** The model is the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D, using N=2 replicas.\n2.  **Identify the target space:** For symmetry class D with N replicas, the sigma-model is defined on the supermanifold given by the coset space `G/H = O(2N|2N) / (O(N|N) x O(N|N))`.\n3.  **Formulate the calculation:** The number of bosonic variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of this coset space. This dimension is calculated by taking the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic parts of the Lie superalgebras `g = o(2N|2N)` and `h = o(N|N) \\oplus o(N|N)`.\n4.  **Calculate dimensions:**\n    *   The bosonic part of the Lie superalgebra `g = o(2N|2N)` is `g_B = o(2N) \\oplus o(2N)`. The dimension of the orthogonal Lie algebra `o(k)` is `k(k-1)/2`. Therefore, `dim(g_B) = 2 * [2N(2N-1)/2] = 2N(2N-1)`.\n    *   The bosonic part of `h = o(N|N) \\oplus o(N|N)` is `h_B = o(N) \\oplus o(N) \\oplus o(N) \\oplus o(N)`. Therefore, `dim(h_B) = 4 * [N(N-1)/2] = 2N(N-1)`.\n5.  **Find the result:** The number of variables is `dim(g_B) - dim(h_B) = 2N(2N-1) - 2N(N-1) = 2N^2`.\n6.  **Substitute N=2:** For two replicas, we set N=2 in the formula to get the final number.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the result, showing each step of the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_class_d_bosonic_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassmann variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model in symmetry class D with two replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas for the disordered system\n    N = 2\n\n    # The number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables is given by the dimension\n    # of the bosonic part of the target space G/H, where G = O(2N|2N) and\n    # H = O(N|N) x O(N|N).
