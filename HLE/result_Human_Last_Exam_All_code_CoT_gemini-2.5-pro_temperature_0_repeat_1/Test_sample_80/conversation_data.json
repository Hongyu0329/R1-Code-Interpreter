    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Edge Squares:** First, determine the total number of squares on the outer edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard. An edge has 8 squares, but the 4 corner squares are shared by two edges. A simpler calculation is `4 * (side_length - 1)`, which is `4 * (8 - 1) = 28`.\n2.  **Separate by Color:** A key property of bishops is that they only move on squares of their own color. This means we can solve the problem for white squares and black squares independently and then combine the results. The 28 edge squares are evenly split into 14 white and 14 black squares.\n3.  **Maximize Bishops on One Color:** We need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 edge squares of a single color (e.g., white). A simple strategy is to place bishops on all the white squares of one edge, like the first row (a1, c1, e1, g1). Then, we add bishops to any remaining white edge squares that are not attacked by this initial set. This analysis shows that a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops can be placed on the 14 white edge squares.\n4.  **Calculate Total Bishops:** By symmetry, the same logic applies to the black squares. Therefore, a maximum of 7 bishops can also be placed on the 14 black edge squares. The total number of bishops placed is `7 (white) + 7 (black) = 14`.\n5.  **Find Empty Squares:** Finally, subtract the total number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find how many are empty.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of a chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # Each of the 4 sides has (board_size - 1) unique edge squares.\n    total_edge_squares = 4 * (board_size - 1)\n    print(f\"An {board_size}x{board_size} chessboard has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n\n    # Step 2: The problem can be split by color.\n    # The edge squares are evenly divided between white and black.\n    edge_squares_per_color = total_edge_squares // 2\n    print(f\"These are divided into {edge_squares_per_color} white squares and {edge_squares_per_color} black squares.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on one color's edge squares.\n    # Through analysis, it's found that you can place a maximum of 7 non-attacking\n    # bishops on the 14 white edge squares (e.g., on a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, f8).\n    max_bishops_one_color = 7\n    print(f\"On the {edge_squares_per_color} squares of a single color, a maximum of {max_bishops_one_color} non-attacking bishops can be placed.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of bishops that can be placed.\n    # This is the sum for both white and black squares.\n    total_bishops_placed = max_bishops_one_color * 2\n    print(f\"By symmetry, the total number of bishops that can be placed on all edge squares is {max_bishops_one_color} + {max_bishops_one_color} = {total_bishops_placed}.\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the number of empty edge squares.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - total_bishops_placed\n    print(\"\\nThe number of edge squares lacking bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops placed.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {total_edge_squares} - {total_bishops_placed} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
