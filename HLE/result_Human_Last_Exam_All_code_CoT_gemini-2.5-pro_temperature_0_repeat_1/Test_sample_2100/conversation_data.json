    "This is a fascinating historical and literary question. Here is my plan to solve it:\n1.  Analyze the clues provided in the prompt: the poet (Andrei Voznesensky), the description (\"a joy-discovering sailor\"), the question about a lost grave, and the timeline for the grave's rediscovery (late 1980s).\n2.  Connect the poet, Andrei Voznesensky, to his famous works. His most relevant work is the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n3.  Identify the historical figure at the center of \"Juno and Avos.\" This is the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n4.  Verify that the other clues match Nikolai Rezanov's life story. He was an explorer (\"sailor\"). He died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and his grave was lost after the cathedral where he was buried was destroyed by the Soviets. His remains were located and reburied in the late 1980s.\n5.  The man's last name is therefore Rezanov.\n6.  I will write a simple Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_historical_figure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies a historical figure based on a set of clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: The poet who wrote about him.\n    poet = \"Andrei Voznesensky\"\n\n    # Clue 2: The description from the poem.\n    description = \"a joy-discovering sailor\"\n\n    # Clue 3: The historical context of his grave.\n    grave_status = \"Lost for many years, then rediscovered in the late 1980s.\"\n\n    # Analysis: These clues point to the Russian explorer and diplomat Nikolai Rezanov.\n    # Voznesensky's famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" is about Rezanov's journey.\n    # Rezanov died in 1807, and his grave in Krasnoyarsk was lost until its rediscovery\n    # in the late 1980s.\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\n    print(f\"The man called '{description}' by {poet} is Nikolai {last_name}.\")\n    print(f\"His grave was rediscovered in the { 'late 1980s' }.\")\n    print(f\"The last name is: {last_name}\")\n\nfind_historical_figure()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
