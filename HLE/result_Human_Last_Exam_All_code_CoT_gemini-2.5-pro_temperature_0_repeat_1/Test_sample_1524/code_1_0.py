    # 1. The Bose-Einstein Distribution
    # The starting point is the Bose-Einstein distribution, which gives the average
    # number of bosons, n(ϵ), in a single-particle state with energy ϵ.
    # The equation is: n(ϵ) = 1 / [exp((ϵ - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1]
    # where:
    #   ϵ   is the energy of the state.
    #   μ   is the chemical potential.
    #   k_B is the Boltzmann constant.
    #   T   is the absolute temperature.

    # 2. The Physical Constraint
    # For n(ϵ) to be a positive number, the denominator must be positive.
    # This means: exp((ϵ - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1 > 0
    # which simplifies to: exp((ϵ - μ) / (k_B * T)) > 1
    # Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives: (ϵ - μ) / (k_B * T) > 0
    # Since k_B and T are positive, this leads to the fundamental constraint: ϵ - μ > 0, or μ < ϵ.
    print("Step 2: The Physical Constraint")
    print("For the occupation number n(ϵ) to be positive, the denominator must be positive.")
    print("This leads to the fundamental inequality: μ < ϵ")
    print("This must be true for ALL possible energy states ϵ.\n")

    # 3. The Limit for the Whole System
    # The condition μ < ϵ must hold for every energy level, including the lowest
    # possible energy, the ground state energy, which we denote as ϵ₀.
    # Therefore, the most stringent limit on the chemical potential is: μ < ϵ₀.
    # The chemical potential must always be less than the ground state energy.
    print("Step 3: The Limit for the System")
    print("The condition must hold for the lowest energy state, ϵ₀ (the ground state energy).")
    print("Therefore, the absolute limit is: μ < ϵ₀\n")

    # 4. Approaching Condensation
    # As the temperature T is lowered, more and more particles occupy the lower energy states.
    # To accommodate this, the chemical potential μ must increase and get closer and closer to ϵ₀.
    # At the critical temperature (T_c), a macroscopic number of particles begins to occupy the ground state.
    # For any temperature T <= T_c, the chemical potential is effectively 'pinned' at the ground state energy.
    # So, in the condensed phase, we have μ ≈ ϵ₀.
    print("Step 4: Approaching and Entering Condensation (T <= T_c)")
    print("As temperature T is lowered towards the critical temperature T_c, μ increases and approaches ϵ₀.")
    print("In the Bose-Einstein condensed phase, the chemical potential is pinned at this limit: μ = ϵ₀.\n")

    # 5. Evaluating the Answer Choices
    # We need to find the choice that corresponds to μ = ϵ₀.
    # Choice C states: "μ must be equal to the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature."
    # At zero temperature (T=0), all particles in a non-interacting Bose gas are in the ground state (ϵ₀).
    # The chemical potential for such a system is exactly the ground state energy, ϵ₀.
    # Therefore, this choice accurately describes the limiting value of the chemical potential in a BEC.
    print("Step 5: Conclusion")
    print("The chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at T=0 is, by definition, the ground state energy ϵ₀.")
    print("This matches our derived limit for a system in the condensed phase.")
    print("Thus, choice C is the correct answer.\n")
