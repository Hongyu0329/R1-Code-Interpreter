# The riddle points towards a man described by Kurt Vonnegut as looking like a porcupine,
# whose name is two words starting with the same letter.
# While Vonnegut said this of Bertrand Russell, his name doesn't fit the alliteration rule.
# A better fit is the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, whom Vonnegut admired and who is
# famously depicted with wild, porcupine-like hair.
# A fitting, alliterative descriptive name for him is "Sad Schopenhauer".
