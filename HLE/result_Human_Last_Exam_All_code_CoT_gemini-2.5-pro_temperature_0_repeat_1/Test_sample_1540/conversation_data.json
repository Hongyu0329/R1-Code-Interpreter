    "My plan is to determine the most memory-efficient way to solve this problem in C and then calculate the total memory in bytes used for the variables in that optimal program.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Problem Analysis:** The goal is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case. The strings are of the same length, up to 100 characters.\n2.  **Standard Approach:** The most straightforward approach is to read both strings into two character arrays (buffers). For strings up to 100 characters, we would need `char str1[101];` and `char str2[101];` (the extra byte is for the null terminator `\\0`). This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the buffers.\n3.  **Memory Optimization:** To find the *most* memory-efficient solution, we should try to avoid using two full buffers. The problem requires comparing the character at index `i` of the first string with the character at index `i` of the second string. Since the input is sequential (first string, then second string), we cannot compare them simultaneously without storing at least one of them.\n4.  **Optimal Algorithm:** The most memory-efficient algorithm is to:\n    *   Read the first string and store it in a buffer. This is unavoidable.\n    *   Read the second string one character at a time.\n    *   As each character of the second string is read, compare it (case-insensitively) with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n    *   This way, we only need one buffer for the first string and a single character variable for the second string's characters.\n5.  **Variable Declaration and Memory Calculation:**\n    *   **First String Buffer:** To store the first string of up to 100 characters, we need a character array. `char s1[101];`. The size of a `char` in C is guaranteed to be 1 byte. So, this variable uses **101 bytes**.\n    *   **Loop Index:** We need an index to iterate through the first string. The length is at most 100, so the index will go from 0 to 99. This range fits within a `char` type variable (which can typically hold values from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255). Using `char i;` is more memory-efficient than using `int i;` (which is usually 4 bytes). This variable uses **1 byte**.\n    *   **Second String Character:** We need a variable to hold the current character being read from the second string. A `char` is sufficient. `char c2;`. This variable uses **1 byte**.\n\n6.  **Total Memory Calculation:**\n    *   Memory for `s1`: 101 bytes\n    *   Memory for `i`: 1 byte\n    *   Memory for `c2`: 1 byte\n    *   Total memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 102 bytes.\n\nWait, let me re-check the logic for reading the second string.\nThe code would look like this:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char s1[101];\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n    // After scanf, the file pointer is after the first word.\n    // The next input is on a new line. We need to consume the newline character.\n    getchar(); \n\n    char i = 0;\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        char c2 = getchar(); // Read one char from the second string\n        // ... comparison logic ...\n        i++;\n    }\n    // ...\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThe variables are indeed `s1`, `i`, and `c2`. Let's re-calculate.\n`s1`: `char[101]` -> 101 bytes.\n`i`: `char` -> 1 byte.\n`c2`: `char` -> 1 byte.\nTotal = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes. My previous calculation was off by one.\n\nFinal check:\n- `s1` buffer: 101 bytes. Necessary.\n- `i` index: 1 byte (`char`). Optimal.\n- `c2` character holder: 1 byte (`char`). Necessary for the algorithm.\nTotal memory for variables = 103 bytes. This is the minimum possible.\n\n<<<103>>>"
