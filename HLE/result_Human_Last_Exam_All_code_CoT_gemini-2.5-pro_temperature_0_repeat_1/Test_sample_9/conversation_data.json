    "To compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the space X**: We will precisely define the moduli space $X$ as a quotient of Lie groups based on the definition of a lattice and the unit area condition.\n2.  **Simplify the space X**: We will show that $X$ is homeomorphic to a more commonly studied space, $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the moduli space of *oriented* lattices of unit area. This is a key, though somewhat counter-intuitive, step.\n3.  **Identify the fundamental group of Y**: The space $Y$ is a well-known topological space, and its fundamental group $\\pi_1(Y)$ is the braid group $B_3$.\n4.  **Compute the homology group**: The first homology group $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(Y)^{ab}$. We will compute the abelianization of $B_3$.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan by printing out each step of the mathematical argument.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides a step-by-step derivation for the first homology group\n    of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Computing H_1(X, Z) for the moduli space of unit-area lattices in R^2.\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the space X\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify the moduli space X.\")\n    print(\"A lattice in R^2 is represented by an invertible 2x2 matrix A from GL(2, R).\")\n    print(\"Two matrices A, B represent the same lattice if B = A.U for some U in GL(2, Z).\")\n    print(\"The space of all lattices is the quotient space GL(2, R) / GL(2, Z).\")\n    print(\"The area of the fundamental domain of the lattice is |det(A)|.\")\n    print(\"The condition of unit area means we consider matrices in SL_pm(2, R) = {A in GL(2, R) | |det(A)| = 1}.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the moduli space X is the quotient space X = SL_pm(2, R) / GL(2, Z).\")\n\n    # Step 2: Relate X to a simpler space Y\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Show that X is homeomorphic to the space of oriented lattices Y.\")\n    print(\"The space of *oriented* lattices of unit area is Y = SL(2, R) / SL(2, Z).\")\n    print(\"There is a natural map phi: Y -> X given by phi([A]_SL) = [A]_GL.\")\n    print(\"This map is a homeomorphism.
