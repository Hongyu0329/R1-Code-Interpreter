    "The Gauss class number problem involves determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields (which correspond to negative fundamental discriminants) that have a specific class number. This is a complex problem in number theory, and the results are typically found by consulting pre-computed tables derived from extensive theoretical work and computation, rather than by a simple script.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that looks up this known mathematical result. The script will:\n1.  Define the target class number, which is 48.\n2.  Store the known count for class number 48. This value is taken from established mathematical tables, such as those compiled by Mark Watkins.\n3.  Print the result in a clear sentence, showing both the class number and the corresponding count of discriminants.\n\n```python\ndef solve_class_number_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the known count of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number.\n\n    The Gauss class number problem is a deep question in number theory.
