    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to account for both the simple dissolution of the solid and the formation of a soluble complex ion. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Chemical Equilibria:** The system involves two main reactions:\n    *   The dissolution of solid Al(OH)3 into its ions: `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`, governed by the solubility product constant, `K_sp`.\n    *   The formation of the soluble tetra-hydroxyaluminate(III) complex ion: `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`, governed by the formation constant, `K_f`.\n\n2.  **Define Solubility:** The total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all aluminum-containing species in the solution.\n    `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n3.  **Establish the Master Equation:** To find the unknown concentrations, we use the principle of charge neutrality. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges in the solution. The ions present are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    Charge Balance Equation: `3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n4.  **Solve for [OH⁻]:** We can express the concentration of each ion in the charge balance equation in terms of a single variable, the hydroxide concentration `[OH⁻]`.\n    *   From K_sp: `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH⁻]^3`\n    *   From K_f and K_sp: `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH⁻]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]^3) * [OH⁻]^4 = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]`\n    *   From the autoionization of water (Kw): `[H+] = Kw / [OH⁻]`\n\n    Substituting these into the charge balance equation gives a single equation that can be solved for `[OH⁻]`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Solubility:** Once `[OH⁻]` is known, we can calculate the concentrations of `[Al^3+]` and `[Al(OH)4^-]` and sum them to find the total solubility, S.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final solubility.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, considering complex ion formation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given constants\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27\n    K_f = 1.1e31\n    Kw = 1.0e-14\n\n    # --- Step 1: Set up the equation to find [OH-] ---\n    # The system is governed by the charge balance equation:\n    # 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n    # We express each concentration in terms of x = [OH-]:\n    # 3*(K_sp/x^3) + (Kw/x) = x + (K_sp*K_f*x)\n    # Rearranging gives a polynomial in x.
