Yes, adding a birefringent medium can cause the theory to fail. A birefringent medium introduces a deterministic, polarization-dependent phase shift that breaks the time-reversal symmetry often required by techniques like optical phase conjugation to "see through" or "invert" the effects of a random medium. The provided simulation shows that the fidelity of reconstructing the original beam drops significantly when a birefringent element is added to the system.
