# Explanation of the physical and mathematical reasoning
print("To create the strongest possible gravitational field at a point A, the playdough must be arranged in a specific 'poppy-seed' shape.")
print("We place point A at the origin of a spherical coordinate system. The boundary of this shape is given by r(θ)² = k * cos(θ), where 'k' is a constant.")

print("\nStep 1: Determine the constant 'k' using the volume V = 1 m³.")
print("The volume of this shape is calculated by an integral, which results in the formula:")
print("V = (4 * π / 15) * k^(3/2)")
print("Setting V = 1, we solve for k: k = (15 / (4 * π))^(2/3)")

print("\nStep 2: Find the furthest point on the surface from A.")
print("The distance from A to the surface is r(θ) = sqrt(k * cos(θ)).")
print("This distance is maximum when cos(θ) is maximum (cos(0) = 1).")
print("So, the maximum distance r_max = sqrt(k).")

print("\nStep 3: Substitute 'k' to find the final expression for r_max.")
print("r_max = sqrt([ (15 / (4 * π))^(2/3) ])")
print("This simplifies to the final equation for the maximum distance.")

# Define the components of the final equation
numerator = 15
denominator_coeff = 4
power_num = 1
power_den = 3

# Print the final equation with its numerical parts
print(f"\nFinal Equation: r_max = ({numerator} / ({denominator_coeff} * π)) ^ ({power_num}/{power_den})")

# Calculate the result
r_max = (numerator / (denominator_coeff * math.pi))**(power_num / power_den)

# Print the final answer
