    This function determines the smallest natural number N with the property that,
    for every anisotropic quadratic form Q in N variables over a specific field K,
    the map defined by Q is surjective.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The field K is a 2-dimensional local field of characteristic 2.
    2. The u-invariant of K, which is the maximum dimension of an anisotropic
       quadratic form over K, is u(K) = 8.
    3. The property is vacuously true for any N > u(K), because no anisotropic
       forms of such dimension exist. So the property holds for N = 9, 10, ...
    4. For N = u(K) = 8, there exist anisotropic quadratic forms of dimension 8.
       However, a theorem by Hoffmann and Laghribi shows that not all of them
       are surjective. Therefore, the property does not hold for N=8.
    5. The smallest N for which the property holds is thus 9.
