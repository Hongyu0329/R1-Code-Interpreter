    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means the compound matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to find such a factorization:\n1.  Rewrite the factorization equation as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\n2.  Let $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. We need to choose its polynomial entries such that when multiplied by $H(s)$, the resulting matrix $N(s)$ is also a polynomial matrix.\n3.  The product is $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}$. For $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, the elements in the first column must be polynomials. This imposes conditions on the rows of $D(s)$.\n4.  We seek a simple choice for $D(s)$ that satisfies these conditions and results in a coprime pair. Let's try to construct $D(s)$ row by row.\n    - For the first row of $N(s)$, we need $d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{d_{11}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}}{s^2-1}$ to be a polynomial. This means the numerator must be divisible by $s^2-1$. A simple choice that works is $d_{11}(s) = 1$ and $d_{12}(s) = s-1$, which makes the numerator $(s-1)^2 + 2(s-1) = (s-1)(s+1) = s^2-1$.\n    - For the second row, we need $\\frac{d_{21}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}}{s^2-1}$ to be a polynomial. A simple choice is to set $d_{21}(s) = 0$. Then we need $2d_{22}$ to be divisible by $s^2-1$. The simplest polynomial choice for $d_{22}(s)$ is $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$.\n5.  This gives us the candidate matrices $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n6.  Finally, we verify that these matrices are left coprime by checking that the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all $s$. The matrix is $[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. A $2 \\times 2$ minor of this matrix is formed by columns 0 and 2, which is $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 2$. Since this minor is a non-zero constant, the rank of the matrix is always 2. Thus, the factorization is coprime.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to define these matrices and print them.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays a left coprime factorization for the given transfer function.\n    H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # The determined left coprime factorization matrices D(s) and N(s)\n    D = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    N = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [2, 0]\n    ])\n\n    # Print the matrices D(s) and N(s) that form the factorization\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D)\n    \n    # Output each element of D(s) for the equation\n    print(\"\\nEquation for D(s):\")\n    print(f\"D(1,1) = {D[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D(1,2) = {D[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"D(2,1) = {D[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D(2,2) = {D[1,1]}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N)\n\n    # Output each element of N(s) for the equation\n    print(\"\\nEquation for N(s):\")\n    print(f\"N(1,1) = {N[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N(1,2) = {N[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"N(2,1) = {N[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N(2,2) = {N[1,1]}\")\n\n    # Verification (optional, but good practice)\n    # H = D^-1 * N\n    H_reconstructed = sympy.simplify(D.inv() * N)\n    \n    print(\"\\nVerification:\")\n    print(\"H(s) reconstructed from D(s)^-1 * N(s):\")\n    sympy.pprint(H_reconstructed)\n\ncalculate_left_coprime_factorization()\n```\n<<<D(s) = [[1, s - 1], [0, s**2 - 1]], N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]>>>"
