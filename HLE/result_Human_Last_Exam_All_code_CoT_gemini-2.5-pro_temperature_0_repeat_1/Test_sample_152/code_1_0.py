# Based on the analysis, we can determine the properties of cell 9.

# 1. Determine the shape. The pattern is three of each shape (Circle, Square, Triangle).
# Cell 9 is the third in the Triangle group.
shape = "Triangle"

# 2. Determine the arrow position. For the Triangle group, the angle follows the
# pattern n * pi, where n is the index (0, 1, 2). For cell 9, n=2.
n = 2
angle_rad = n * math.pi  # This is 2*pi

# 3. Determine the number of dots. The formula is Angle / (pi/3).
# The angle for the dot calculation is 2*pi.
num_dots = angle_rad / (math.pi / 3)

# 4. Format the final output string according to the rules.
# The shape is "Triangle."
# The number of dots is an integer, so it's "6 dots."
# The angle 2*pi is the "straight up" position.
final_text = f"{shape}. {int(num_dots)} dots. Arrow is straight up."
