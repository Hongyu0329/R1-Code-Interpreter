    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$, we first need to determine the quadratic irrational number whose continued fraction we need to find.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the quadratic irrational.** The generalized Markov number $m_{p/q}$ is associated with the quadratic irrational number $\\alpha_{p/q} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{9 - 4(p/q)^2}}{2(p/q)}$. We will substitute $p=4$ and $q=7$ to find the specific number for this problem.\n2.  **Simplify the expression.** We will perform the arithmetic to get our number into a simpler form, $\\frac{A - \\sqrt{D}}{C}$.\n3.  **Compute the continued fraction.** We will use an algorithm to compute the continued fraction of this number. A quadratic irrational has a continued fraction that is eventually periodic. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n    - Let the number be $\\xi_0$.\n    - For $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$:\n        - $a_i = \\lfloor \\xi_i \\rfloor$ (the integer part)\n        - $\\xi_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{\\xi_i - a_i}$\n    - We will keep track of the intermediate numbers $\\xi_i$. Since the expansion is periodic, one of these numbers will eventually repeat. When a repetition is found, we have identified the periodic part of the continued fraction.\n4.  **Represent the numbers.** To avoid floating-point errors, we will represent the numbers $\\xi_i$ in the form $\\frac{P + \\sqrt{D}}{Q}$ using integer arithmetic.\n5.  **Format the output.** The final result will be presented in the standard notation for continued fractions, e.g., $[a_0; a_1, a_2, \\overline{a_3, \\dots, a_k}]$.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n1.  **Find $\\alpha_{4/7}$**:\n    With $p=4$ and $q=7$, we have:\n    $\\alpha_{4/7} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{9 - 4(4/7)^2}}{2(4/7)} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{9 - 4(16/49)}}{8/7}$\n    $= \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{\\frac{441 - 64}{49}}}{8/7} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{\\frac{377}{49}}}{8/7}$\n    $= \\frac{3 - \\frac{\\sqrt{377}}{7}}{8/7} = \\frac{\\frac{21 - \\sqrt{377}}{7}}{\\frac{8}{7}} = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{377}}{8}$\n\n2.  **Compute the continued fraction for $\\alpha_0 = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{377}}{8}$**:\n    - $a_0 = \\lfloor \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{377}}{8} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{21 - 19.416...}{8} \\rfloor = 0$.\n    - $\\alpha_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{21 - \\sqrt{377}}{8} - 0} = \\frac{8}{21 - \\sqrt{377}} = \\frac{8(21 + \\sqrt{377})}{21^2 - 377} = \\frac{8(21 + \\sqrt{377})}{64} = \\frac{21 + \\sqrt{377}}{8}$.\n    - $a_1 = \\lfloor \\frac{21 + \\sqrt{377}}{8} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{21 + 19.416...}{8} \\rfloor = 5$.\n    - $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{21 + \\sqrt{377}}{8} - 5} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{377} - 19} = \\frac{8(\\sqrt{377} + 19)}{377 - 361} = \\frac{19 + \\sqrt{377}}{2}$.\n    - This process is continued until a remainder $\\alpha_i$ repeats. My manual calculation showed the continued fraction to be $[0; 5, \\overline{19, 4, 1, 4}]$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this algorithm to find the continued fraction expansion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd_three(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of three integers.\"\"\"\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(a, b), c)\n\ndef get_continued_fraction_for_quadratic_irrational(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction for the quadratic irrational associated with m_{p/q}.\n    The number is alpha = (3 - sqrt(9 - 4*(p/q)**2)) / (2*(p/q)).\n    This simplifies to (3*q - sqrt(9*q**2 - 4*p**2)) / (2*p).\n    We represent a number (A + B*sqrt(D)) / C as a tuple (A, B, C).\n    \"\"\"\n    # D = 9*q^2 - 4*p^2\n    D = 9 * q**2 - 4 * p**2\n    \n    # Initial number: (3q - sqrt(D)) / (2p)\n    # (A, B, C) represents (A + B*sqrt(D)) / C\n    # So, A = 3q, B = -1, C = 2p\n    A = 3 * q\n    B = -1\n    C = 2 * p\n    \n    # Simplify the initial representation\n    common_divisor = gcd_three(A, B, C)\n    A //= common_divisor\n    B //= common_divisor\n    C //= common_divisor\n\n    # Store seen states (A, B, C) to detect cycles\n    seen_states = {}\n    coeffs = []\n    \n    # Loop to find coefficients and detect the cycle\n    while (A, B, C) not in seen_states:\n        seen_states[(A, B, C)] = len(coeffs)\n        \n        # Calculate the integer part a_i\n        # a_i = floor((A + B*sqrt(D)) / C)\n        # Note: B can be negative\n        a_i = math.floor((A + B * math.sqrt(D)) / C)\n        coeffs.append(a_i)\n        \n        # Calculate the next state for alpha_{i+1} = 1 / (alpha_i - a_i)\n        # alpha_i - a_i = (A - a_i*C + B*sqrt(D)) / C\n        # Let A' = A - a_i*C\n        A_prime = A - a_i * C\n        \n        # 1 / (alpha_i - a_i) = C / (A' + B*sqrt(D))\n        # Rationalize the denominator: C * (A' - B*sqrt(D)) / (A'^2 - B^2*D)\n        next_A_num = C * A_prime\n        next_B_num = -C * B\n        next_C_den = A_prime**2 - B**2 * D\n        \n        # Update A, B, C for the next iteration\n        A = next_A_num\n        B = next_B_num\n        C = next_C_den\n        \n        # Simplify the new fraction by dividing by GCD\n        common_divisor = gcd_three(A, B, C)\n        A //= common_divisor\n        B //= common_divisor\n        C //= common_divisor\n\n    # Cycle detected\n    start_of_cycle_index = seen_states[(A, B, C)]\n    non_repeating_part = coeffs[:start_of_cycle_index]\n    repeating_part = coeffs[start_of_cycle_index:]\n    \n    return non_repeating_part, repeating_part\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to compute and print the continued fraction for m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    p, q = 4, 7\n    \n    # Calculate the initial number for clarity in the output\n    D_val = 9 * q**2 - 4 * p**2\n    num_str = f\"({3*q} - sqrt({D_val})) / {2*p}\"\n\n    non_repeating, repeating = get_continued_fraction_for_quadratic_irrational(p, q)\n    \n    # Format the output string\n    non_repeating_str = \", \".join(map(str, non_repeating[1:]))\n    repeating_str = \", \".join(map(str, repeating))\n    \n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We interpret this as clearly stating the coefficients of the continued fraction.\n    print(f\"The quadratic irrational number associated with m_{p}/{q} is {num_str}.\")\n    \n    if not non_repeating: # Purely periodic\n        result_str = f\"[{repeating[0]}; ({', '.join(map(str, repeating[1:]))})]\"\n    elif len(non_repeating) == 1: # No pre-period after a0\n        result_str = f\"[{non_repeating[0]}; ({repeating_str})]\"\n    else:\n        result_str = f\"[{non_repeating[0]}; {non_repeating_str}, ({repeating_str})]\"\n\n    print(f\"Its continued fraction is: {result_str}\")\n    \n    # For the final answer format\n    global final_answer\n    final_answer = result_str\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    final_answer = \"\"\n    main()\n    # The final answer format requested by the prompt\n    # print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```\n<<<[0; 5, (19, 4, 1, 4)]>>>"
