def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes the provided Go puzzle and determines the killing move for White.

    The board state is as follows:
    Black stones: A2, B3, B4, C1, C2
    White stones: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5
    It is White's turn to move.

    Analysis:
    1. The black stones form a single weak group. The key to this group's life or death is the point B2.
    2. If White plays at any point other than B2, Black can play at B2, connecting the group and securing enough space to live by making two eyes.
    3. If White plays at B2, it initiates a killing sequence (a tesuji):
        - W[B2]: This puts the black stones at C1 and C2 in atari.
        - B[B1]: This is Black's only response to save the stones. This move captures the white stone at B2.
        - After Black captures, the group is left with a fatal weakness. The point B2 is now a false eye.
        - White can then proceed to remove the group's outer liberties (e.g., by playing at A3, A4, and A1).
        - The black group cannot make a second eye and will ultimately be captured.

    Therefore, the only move that initiates a kill sequence is B2.
