    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integral is of the form `∫ (f'(x) / f(x)) dx`. The antiderivative of this form is `ln|f(x)|`. In this problem, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1, which results in `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**:\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`.\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n4.  **Check the Sign**: For `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `F₃(x)` is always positive, so we can remove the absolute value signs. The value of the integral `V` is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n5.  **Write the Python Code**: I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Import the `math` library for `sin`, `exp`, and `log`.\n    *   Calculate the numerical values for `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)`.\n    *   Compute the value of the integral `V`.\n    *   Calculate `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer.\n    *   Print the components of the final equation and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the function F3(x) based on the problem description.\n# F₀(x) = x\n# F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n# F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n# F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\ndef F3(x):\n    return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n# Step 2: The integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln(F₃(x)).\n# We need to evaluate this from 0 to 1.\n# Value V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n\n# Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)\nF3_at_0 = F3(0)\nF3_at_1 = F3(1)\n\n# Calculate the value of the integral V\nV = math.log(F3_at_1) - math.log(F3_at_0)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final value as requested\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\n# Step 4: Print the numbers in the final equation and the result\nprint(\"The integral V is calculated as: ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) = {F3_at_0}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {F3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({F3_at_1}) - ln({F3_at_0}) = {V}\")\nprint(f\"The value to report is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V = {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {closest_integer}\")\n\n```\n<<<5487>>>"
