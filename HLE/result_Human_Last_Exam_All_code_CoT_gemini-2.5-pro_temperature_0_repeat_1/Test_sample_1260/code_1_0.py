    Analyzes the stock market scenario to determine the most probable answer.

    1. Mathematically interpret the problem statement about buyer and seller returns.
    2. Determine if this market phenomenon is likely to be universal across major exchanges.
    3. Evaluate the provided explanations to find the most probable cause.

    # Step 1: Analyze the core observation from the return definition.
    # The problem states: buyer's 15s return > seller's 15s return.
    # Let p be the trade price and p_prime be the mid-price 15s later.
    # Buyer's return = (p_prime / p) - 1
    # Seller's return = -((p_prime / p) - 1)
    # The inequality is: (p_prime / p) - 1 > -((p_prime / p) - 1)
    # Let's represent the equation in the code.
    # Let the term (p_prime / p) - 1 be represented by 'x'.
    # The inequality is x > -x.
    # This simplifies to 2*x > 0, which means x > 0.
    # Therefore, (p_prime / p) - 1 > 0, which means p_prime > p.
