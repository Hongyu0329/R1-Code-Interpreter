    # The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is a statement about the equality of
    # anomalies calculated at different energy scales. Let's represent the anomaly
    # value calculated in the high-energy (UV) theory and the low-energy (IR)
    # theory. The value itself is a specific number calculated from the theory's content.
    # For this demonstration, let's assign a symbolic value.
    # The core equation of the principle is:
    # Anomaly_UV = Anomaly_IR

    # Let's assign a hypothetical number to the anomaly to fulfill the prompt's requirement.
    # In a real theory like QCD, this would be calculated from the number of colors and flavors.
    anomaly_value = 1 # This is a symbolic value for the sake of the equation.
