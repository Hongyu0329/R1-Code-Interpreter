    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the task, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Conceptual Framework (Large Deviations):** The problem of finding equilibrium properties in statistical mechanics is equivalent to a large deviation problem. The equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state. According to large deviation theory (specifically, Sanov's Theorem), the probability of observing a macroscopic state is related to its \"distance\" (in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence) from a reference state. Minimizing this distance to find the most probable state is equivalent to the principle of maximum entropy.\n\n2.  **Derive the Equilibrium Distribution:** For a gas of photons (bosons where particle number is not conserved), we maximize the Bose-Einstein entropy `S` subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy `E`. This maximization procedure yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average number of photons `<n(ε)>` in a state with energy `ε`:\n    `<n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε / k_B T) - 1)`\n    Here, `T` is the equilibrium temperature and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Calculate Macroscopic Quantities:** To find the total mean energy `E` and total entropy `S` for the entire system, we must sum over all possible energy states. For photons in a 3D cavity of volume `V`, the states form a continuum, so we integrate over the energy `ε`, weighted by the photonic density of states `g(ε)`. This integration leads to the well-known formulas for black-body radiation.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** The Python script below will implement the final derived formulas. It will:\n    *   Define the necessary physical constants (`h`, `c`, `k_B`).\n    *   Implement the formulas for total energy `E` (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law) and total entropy `S`.\n    *   Calculate and print these values for a sample temperature and volume, explicitly showing the components of the final equations as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a photon gas\n    based on the principles of Bose-Einstein statistics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
