    print("Reasoning steps:")
    print("1. Navigation between trees is a long-distance task. It requires a signal that can travel through the air from the source tree to the pollinator.")
    print("2. A chemical volatile that is 'solely within the syconium' is, by definition, trapped inside the fig and not released into the atmosphere.")

    print("Conclusion:")
