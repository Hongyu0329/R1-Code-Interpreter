    This function explains the reasoning behind the correct answer
    to the multiple-choice question about genomic mutation rates.
    """
    explanation = """
The question asks for the dominant factor that maintains an approximately constant genomic mutation rate. The mutation rate itself is a biological trait that is subject to evolutionary forces.

1.  **High Mutation Rate Cost:** A high rate of mutation introduces many new mutations in each generation. Since the vast majority of mutations are either harmful (deleterious) or have no effect (neutral), a high rate leads to a significant "mutational load," which reduces the average fitness of the population.

2.  **Low Mutation Rate Cost:** Conversely, achieving a very low or zero mutation rate requires highly efficient and accurate DNA replication and repair machinery. This machinery is metabolically expensive to build and operate. Furthermore, a complete lack of mutation would limit a population's ability to generate new genetic variation, which is essential for adapting to changing environments.

3.  **The Optimal Balance:** Because of these opposing pressures, there is a trade-off. Natural selection acts to find a balance. It favors a mutation rate that is low enough to avoid being overwhelmed by deleterious mutations, but not so low that the metabolic cost of fidelity becomes too high or adaptive potential is lost. This process drives the mutation rate towards a non-zero, optimal level.

4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the dominant factor that maintains a relatively constant genomic mutation rate is **natural selection for fitness optimality**. It fine-tunes the rate by balancing the negative effects of mutational load against the costs of high-fidelity DNA maintenance.
