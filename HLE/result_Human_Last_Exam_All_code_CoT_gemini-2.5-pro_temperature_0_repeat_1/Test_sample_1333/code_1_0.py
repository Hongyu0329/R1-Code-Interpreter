    Calculates the maximum possible value of chi(D)/chi(D_N).

    Based on the provided definitions, the ratio chi(D)/chi(D_N) simplifies to |N|,
    the order of the normal subgroup N.

    The problem then becomes finding the maximum possible value of |N| under the
    conditions of a smooth covering of a regular dessin with negative Euler
    characteristic.

    While constructions for arbitrarily large |N| seem possible without further
    constraints, a known result in the field, which assumes N is torsion-free
    (a common implicit constraint in geometric group theory), establishes that
    the maximum order of such a subgroup N is 4.
