def solve_vest_complexity():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the theoretical questions about VEST complexity.
    The reasoning for each answer is as follows:

    (a) Is the VEST problem, parameterised by k, still #W[2]-hard if we restrict S to the identity matrix and require all Ti matrices to commute pairwise?
    Answer: No.
    Reasoning: If the matrices T_i commute, the sum of products M_k = sum_{I, |I|=k} prod_{i in I} T_i can be computed efficiently using dynamic programming.
    Let M_{i, l} = sum_{J subset {1..i}, |J|=l} prod_{j in J} T_j.
    Then M_{i, l} = M_{i-1, l} + T_i * M_{i-1, l-1}.
    Computing M_{m, k} this way takes O(m * k * n^omega) time, where n^omega is matrix multiplication time. This is an FPT algorithm.
    Since the problem is in FPT, it cannot be #W[2]-hard (unless FPT=W[2]).

    (b) Is VEST #W[1]-hard if Ti matrices are restricted to diagonal Z2-matrices with at most one non-zero entry on the diagonal?
    Answer: No.
    Reasoning: A matrix T_i is either the zero matrix or E_jj (a single 1 on the diagonal). The product prod_{i in I} T_i is non-zero only if all T_i for i in I are the same E_jj.
    Let P_j = {i | T_i = E_jj}. The sum of products simplifies to sum_{j=1 to n} C(|P_j|, k) * E_jj, where C is the binomial coefficient.
    This can be computed in polynomial time. A problem in P cannot be #W[1]-hard (unless P=W[1]).

    (c) If Ti are restricted to have only one non-zero entry in each row, what is the complexity of the decision version of VEST?
    Answer: W[1]-hard.
    Reasoning: The problem is in XP, as we can iterate through all C(m, k) subsets of matrices. For hardness, we can reduce a known W[1]-hard problem like k-Clique or k-Path. A matrix with one non-zero entry per row is of the form D*P (diagonal times permutation). This structure is powerful enough to construct gadgets that simulate a k-step non-deterministic computation to check, for example, the existence of a k-clique. This places the problem in the W[1]-hard complexity class.
