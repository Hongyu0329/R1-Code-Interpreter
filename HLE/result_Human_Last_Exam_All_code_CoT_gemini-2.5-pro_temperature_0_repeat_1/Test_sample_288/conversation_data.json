    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will analyze the Witvliet et al., 2021 connectome dataset.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Load the adult C. elegans connectome data using the `navis` Python library.\n2.  Filter this data to isolate all synaptic connections originating from the ASJ neurons (ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  Group the filtered connections by their postsynaptic (target) neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n4.  Identify the target neuron that receives the highest total number of synapses from ASJ.\n5.  Finally, I will print the breakdown of synapses from ASJL and ASJR to this main target cell, along with the total sum.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ntry:\n    import navis\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the 'navis' library by running: pip install navis\")\n    exit()\n\ndef find_main_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main synaptic target of ASJ neurons in the adult C. elegans connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Fetch the Witvliet et al. 2021 adult connectome\n        # This dataset contains synaptic connectivity data.\n        conn = navis.fetch_connectome('witvliet-2021')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to fetch connectome data.
