    "To solve this problem, I will calculate the Hurwitz number using a formula from the representation theory of the symmetric group. The Hurwitz number $H$ counting the specified covers is given by a sum over the irreducible characters of the symmetric group $S_d$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Parameters:** The degree of the cover is $d=7$. The ramification profiles correspond to partitions of 7, which define conjugacy classes in $S_7$. The partitions are $\\lambda_1=(4,3)$, $\\lambda_2=(5,2)$, and $\\lambda_3=\\lambda_4=(2,1,1,1,1,1)$.\n2.  **Use the Formula:** The number of covers (assuming a trivial automorphism group, which is standard) is given by:\n    $H = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^4 |C_i|}{(d!)^2} \\sum_{\\chi \\neq \\chi_{\\text{triv}}} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^4 \\chi(\\lambda_i)}{(\\text{deg} \\chi)^{2}}$\n    where the sum is over all non-trivial irreducible characters $\\chi$ of $S_7$, $|C_i|$ is the size of the conjugacy class for partition $\\lambda_i$, and $\\chi(\\lambda_i)$ is the value of the character on that class.\n3.  **Computation:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n    *   The script will use the `sympy` library to access the character table of $S_7$.\n    *   It will first calculate the sizes of the conjugacy classes, $|C_i|$.\n    *   Then, it will iterate through the non-trivial characters of $S_7$ to compute the sum. To maintain precision, the `fractions` module will be used.\n    *   Finally, it will combine the parts of the formula to get the integer result.\n4.  **Output:** The script will print the intermediate values used in the calculation—such as the class sizes and the value of the character sum—before printing the final equation and the resulting Hurwitz number.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import SymmetricGroup\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.partitions import Partition\n\ndef solve_hurwitz_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hurwitz number for a degree 7 cover of P^1 with four specified branch points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
