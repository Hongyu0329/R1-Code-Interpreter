# Step 1: Define the number of true sentences found for each subject based on our analysis.

# For the subject "Satyendranath Bose", we found 2 true combinations:
# 1. Satyendranath Bose was a Bengalese.
# 2. Satyendranath Bose baptized Bosons.
count_bose = 2

# For the subject "The conversation", we found 1 true combination:
# 1. The conversation turned playful.
count_conversation = 1

# For the subject "Sushi", we found 1 true combination:
# 1. Sushi contains fish.
count_sushi = 1

# For the subject "Our Tuna" (interpreted as a Bengal cat), we found 3 true combinations:
# 1. Our Tuna is a Bengalese.
# 2. Our Tuna is playful.
# 3. Our Tuna eats fish.
count_tuna = 3

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of true and meaningful sentences.
total_true_sentences = count_bose + count_conversation + count_sushi + count_tuna

# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.
print("The total number of true and meaningful sentences is the sum of the counts for each subject.")
print(f"The final equation is: {count_bose} + {count_conversation} + {count_sushi} + {count_tuna} = {total_true_sentences}")

# The final answer is the total count.
print(f"Total true and meaningful sentences: {total_true_sentences}")
