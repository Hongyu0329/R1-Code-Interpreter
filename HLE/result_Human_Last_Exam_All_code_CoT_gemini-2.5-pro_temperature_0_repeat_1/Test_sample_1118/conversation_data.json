    "My plan is to first use my knowledge base to identify the object Curt Querner is holding in his 1933 self-portrait. Then, I will write a Python script that presents this information in a clear sentence. To adhere to the instruction of including numbers, the script will define the year the painting was made as a variable and print it as part of the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the known details of the event.\n    year_of_painting = 1933\n    artist_name = \"Curt Querner\"\n    symbol_of_resistance = \"a poppy flower\"\n\n    # Construct the answer, including the number from the \"equation\" as requested.\n    print(f\"In his self-portrait from the year {year_of_painting}, Curt Querner holds a specific object as a symbol of resistance.\")\n    print(f\"The object he holds is: {symbol_of_resistance}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a poppy flower>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
