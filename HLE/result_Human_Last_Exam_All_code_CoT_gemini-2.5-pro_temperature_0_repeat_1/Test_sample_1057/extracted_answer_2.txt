The total Joule heat dissipated is equal to the initial electrostatic energy.
The formula is: Q = 2 * pi * epsilon_0 * a * V^2

Using the example values:
  Radius (a) = 0.1 m
  Potential (V) = 10000 V

The final equation with numbers is:
Q = 2 * 3.141592653589793 * 8.854187817e-12 * 0.1 * 100000000.0

Calculated Joule Heat (Q) = 0.000556 Joules
