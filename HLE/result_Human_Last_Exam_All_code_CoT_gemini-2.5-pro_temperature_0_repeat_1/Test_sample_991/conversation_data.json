    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle that plays on the visual components of the character. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **\"A wooden stick\"**: This clue refers to the Chinese character **木** (mù), which means \"wood\" or \"tree\". This will form the bottom part of our final character.\n2.  **\"hanging a square box\"**: This refers to a square shape, like the character for mouth, **口** (kǒu), or field, **田** (tián). In this case, it's the outline of the **田** component, which sits on top of the **木**.\n3.  **\"a ladder placed in the center\"**: This describes the cross shape `+` inside the **田** component. Visually, a simple cross can be interpreted as a ladder seen from the front.\n\nWhen you combine these visual elements—placing the \"field\" (a box with a ladder inside) on top of the \"tree\"—you form the Chinese character **果** (guǒ).\n\nThe following Python code will print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the Chinese character riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    riddle = \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.\"\n    \n    print(f\"The riddle is: \\\"{riddle}\\\"\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Let's break down the clues to build the character:\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
