    # Part 1: Identify two subsets that are equivalent.
    # The equivalence relation is A ~ B if A is homeomorphic to a subset of B,
    # and B is homeomorphic to a subset of A.

    # Let's consider two subsets of the rational numbers, Q.
    # A = Q intersect (0, 1). This set is homeomorphic to Q itself.
    # B = (Q intersect (0, 1)) U {2}. This set is the disjoint union of a set
    # homeomorphic to Q and a single isolated point.

    # A is a subset of B, so A is homeomorphic to a subset of B.
    # To show B is homeomorphic to a subset of A, we need to find a subset
    # of A that is homeomorphic to B.
    # Let's take the subset A' = (Q intersect (0, 1/2)) U {3/4}.
    # A' is a subset of A.
    # The point 3/4 is isolated in A', and the part (Q intersect (0, 1/2))
    # is homeomorphic to Q. So, A' is homeomorphic to B.
    # Therefore, A and B are equivalent.

    print("A and B are equivalent under the given relation because each can be embedded in the other.")
    print("-" * 35)

    # Part 2: How many equivalence classes does this relation have?
    # Let's analyze the relation for finite sets.
    # Any finite subset of Q with n elements is a discrete space with n points.
    # Let's denote such a set as F_n.
    # Let A be a set with n elements and B be a set with m elements.
    # A is homeomorphic to a subset of B if and only if n <= m.
    # This is because a homeomorphism is a bijection, so it preserves the number of elements.
    # So, A ~ B if and only if (n <= m) and (m <= n), which means n = m.

    # This implies that for every positive integer n, there is a distinct
    # equivalence class for finite sets of size n.
    # For example, F_2 = {1, 2} is not equivalent to F_3 = {1, 2, 3}.

    n = 2
    m = 3
    print(f"Let's check F_{n} = {{1, ..., {n}}} and F_{m} = {{1, ..., {m}}}")

    # F_n can be embedded in F_m because n <= m
    can_embed_n_in_m = (n <= m)
    print(f"Can F_{n} be embedded in F_{m}? {can_embed_n_in_m}")

    # F_m can be embedded in F_n because m <= n
    can_embed_m_in_n = (m <= n)
    print(f"Can F_{m} be embedded in F_{n}? {can_embed_m_in_n}")

    are_equivalent = can_embed_n_in_m and can_embed_m_in_n
    print(f"Are F_{n} and F_{m} equivalent? {are_equivalent}")
    print("-" * 35)

    # Since F_n ~ F_m if and only if n = m, there is one equivalence class for each
    # positive integer: [F_1], [F_2], [F_3], ...
    # This already shows there are infinitely many equivalence classes.

    # In addition to these, we also have classes for:
    # - The empty set
    # - Countably infinite discrete sets
    # - Various other infinite "scattered" sets (like convergent sequences)
    # - A single class for all "non-scattered" sets (those containing a copy of Q)

    # The existence of a distinct class for each size of finite set is sufficient
    # to prove that the total number of equivalence classes is not finite.
    # The prompt's mention of a "final equation" is unusual for this type of problem,
    # as the result is a cardinality, not a numerical calculation. The reasoning
    # above leads to a clear conclusion without an equation.

    print("Conclusion: There is a distinct equivalence class for finite sets of each possible size.")
    print("This means there are infinitely many equivalence classes.")
