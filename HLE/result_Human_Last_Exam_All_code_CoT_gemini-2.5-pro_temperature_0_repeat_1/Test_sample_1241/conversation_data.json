    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. At steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ approach constant values, which we'll denote as $p_i$. This implies that their time derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, become zero.\n\nHere is the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Set the derivatives in the given Kolmogorov-Chapman equations to zero. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n2.  The resulting system of equations for the steady-state probabilities ($p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$) is:\n    *   $0 = -0.019 p_{0} + 0.65 p_{1}$\n    *   $0 = 0.019 p_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) p_{1} + 0.392 p_{2} + 0.008 p_{3}$\n    *   $0 = 0.4 p_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) p_{2}$\n    *   $0 = 0.008 p_{2} - 0.008 p_{3}$\n3.  We must also satisfy the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities is equal to 1:\n    *   $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n4.  One of the original rate equations is redundant. We can form a solvable system of four linear equations by using three of the rate equations and the normalization condition.\n5.  I will use Python with the NumPy library to set up and solve this system of linear equations in the form $A\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{p} = [p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3]^T$.\n6.  Once the vector of probabilities $\\mathbf{p}$ is found, I will calculate the required sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n7.  The final code will print the values of $p_0$ and $p_1$ and their sum, fulfilling the request to show each number in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the transition rates from the problem description.\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# Step 2: Set up the system of linear equations for the steady state.\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), P'(t) = 0.
