    # Statement I is suboptimal as the patient is already failing a taper.
    # Statement III is dangerous and not recommended.
    # Statement II is a valid option, but V is also excellent and was specifically asked about by the patient.
    # Statement IV is the cornerstone of best practice for such a complex case. It provides the framework for any intervention.
    # Statement V directly addresses the patient's question with a modern, safe, and effective treatment.
