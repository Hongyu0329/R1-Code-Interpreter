    Solves the geometry problem by finding the largest possible value for r.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The problem's constraints on the distances between the 5 points mean that their
       distance graph must be a 5-cycle (C5). This is a result from Ramsey Theory.
    2. To maximize r, the points should form a regular pentagon. Let its side length
       be 's' and its diagonal length be 'd'.
    3. The conditions on r become s < r <= d. To find the largest r, we must find
       the largest possible value for d for a regular pentagon that fits in a unit square.
    4. The largest regular pentagon that can be inscribed in a unit square has a
       diagonal of length exactly 1.
    5. The side length 's' of a regular pentagon is related to its diagonal 'd' by the
       golden ratio, phi, where d = s * phi.
    6. From this, we can calculate the values and find the maximum r.
