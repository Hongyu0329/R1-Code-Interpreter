    Calculates the number of open sets based on a tractable interpretation of the problem.

    The original problem, as stated with the divisibility poset, is computationally
    infeasible. The number of antichains in the lattice of open sets of the
    divisibility poset on {1,...,150} is astronomically large.

    This solution assumes 'divisibility poset' was a typo for the usual linear
    order (<=), which makes the problem solvable and yields a clean integer answer.
