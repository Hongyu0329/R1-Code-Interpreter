    # The analysis of each statement is based on the provided definitions and
    # standard quaternion algebra.
    #
    # A: False. The inner product depends on the relative position m-n, not its absolute value |m-n|.
    # B: False. The stated equality does not hold in general.
    # C: True. A fixed axis is required for the rotations to commute and form a group R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}, which is the basis for relative position encoding.
    # D: False. The rotation R_m is parameterized by a single scalar m, thus encoding a 1D position.
    # E: True. R_m is a unit quaternion, and multiplication by a unit quaternion is an isometry, preserving the norm. |R_m(v)| = |R_m|*|v| = 1 * |v| = |v|.
    # F: True. Scalar multiplication (with a real number) commutes with quaternion multiplication. R_m(αv) = R_m * (αv) = α * (R_m * v) = α*R_m(v).
    # G: True. Rotations by a unit quaternion preserve the inner product. ⟨R_m(p), R_m(q)⟩ = ⟨p, q⟩. If ⟨p, q⟩=0, the rotated vectors remain orthogonal.
    # H: True. Since the rotation axis u is fixed, the quaternions R_m and R_n commute, and R_m * R_n = R_{m+n} by De Moivre's formula for quaternions.
    # J: True. The expression is ([R_m, R_n])(v). Since R_m and R_n commute, their commutator [R_m, R_n] is the zero quaternion. The zero quaternion has a zero real part, so it is purely imaginary.
    # K: False. The left-multiplication R_p(v) mixes the real and vector parts of v. The new real part is v_0*cos(pθ) - (u . v_vec)*sin(pθ), which is not v_0 in general.
    # L: True. The matrix for left multiplication by q = a + bi + cj + dk has 'a' on its diagonal four times. The trace is 4a. For R_m, a = cos(mθ), so the trace is 4*cos(mθ).
    # M: False. The commutator [R_m, R_n] is zero for ANY fixed rotation axis u, not only if it's parallel to (1,1,1). The "if and only if" condition makes the statement false.
    # N: False. |R_m(v)| = |v|. For a unit quaternion v, |v|=1. The limit of the constant sequence 1 is 1, not 1/√2.
