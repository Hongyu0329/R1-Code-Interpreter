    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the Python code to find the partition function.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Start with the General Formula:** I will begin with the standard definition of the partition function `Z` in the grand canonical ensemble, which is `Z = Tr[exp(-β(H - μN))]`, where `Tr` is the trace, `β` is the inverse temperature, `H` is the Hamiltonian operator, `μ` is the chemical potential, and `N` is the particle number operator.\n2.  **Substitute the Given Hamiltonian:** I will substitute the specific Hamiltonian provided by the user, `H = -μN`, into the general formula.\n3.  **Simplify the Expression:** The expression in the exponent will be algebraically simplified.\n4.  **Evaluate the Trace:** I will evaluate the trace by summing over a basis of states with a definite particle number, `|N>`. This converts the trace operation into an infinite summation over `N`.\n5.  **Solve the Geometric Series:** The resulting summation is a standard geometric series. I will provide the formula for the sum of this series, which gives the final expression for `Z`.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically represent and print each step of this derivation, culminating in the final equation for the partition function `Z`. As requested, the code will also explicitly print the numerical constants found in the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the partition function Z for a system\n    with Hamiltonian H = -μN in the grand canonical ensemble.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbols for our equation\n    Z, H_op, N_op, mu, beta = sp.symbols('Z H_op N_op mu beta')\n    N = sp.Symbol('N', integer=True, nonnegative=True)\n    Tr = sp.Function('Tr')\n    exp = sp.exp\n\n    print(\"Derivation of the Partition Function Z:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: State the general formula\n    print(\"Step 1: The general formula for the grand canonical partition function is:\")\n    general_formula = sp.Eq(Z, Tr(exp(-beta * (H_op - mu * N_op))))\n    print(sp.pretty(general_formula, use_unicode=True))\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Substitute the given Hamiltonian\n    print(\"Step 2: We substitute the given Hamiltonian H_op = -μ * N_op:\")\n    H_specific = -mu * N_op\n    substituted_formula = general_formula.subs(H_op, H_specific)\n    print(sp.pretty(substituted_formula, use_unicode=True))\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Simplify the exponent\n    print(\"Step 3: Simplify the expression inside the exponent:\")\n    print(\"  -β * ((-μ * N_op) - (μ * N_op))\")\n    print(\"= -β * (-2 * μ * N_op)\")\n    print(\"= 2 * β * μ * N_op\")\n    simplified_formula = sp.Eq(Z, Tr(exp(2 * beta * mu * N_op)))\n    print(\"\\nThis gives the simplified partition function:\")\n    print(sp.pretty(simplified_formula, use_unicode=True))\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 4: Evaluate the trace\n    print(\"Step 4: We evaluate the trace (Tr) by summing over the particle number states |N>.\")\n    print(\"In this basis, the operator N_op becomes the number N.
