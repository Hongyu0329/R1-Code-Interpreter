    "My plan is to first research the neuroanatomy of the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*) or closely related cephalopods to identify the brain lobes. I will specifically look for anatomical diagrams and descriptions that show the relative positions of the lobes, focusing on the palliovisceral lobe and the structures located posteriorly (towards the rear of the animal) to it. Based on this research, I will identify the adjacent posterior brain regions and then present this information using a Python script that prints the answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the names of the brain regions located\n    posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \n    The palliovisceral lobe is a major part of the posterior subesophageal mass\n    of the cephalopod brain. It is one of the most posterior lobes itself.\n    The region that can be described as lying adjacent and posterior to, or\n    arising from the posterior part of, the palliovisceral lobe is the\n    Giant Fibre Lobe, which controls the giant axon system for jet propulsion.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    palliovisceral_lobe = \"Palliovisceral Lobe\"\n    posterior_adjacent_region = \"Giant Fibre Lobe\"\n    \n    print(f\"The brain region lying adjacent posteriorly to the {palliovisceral_lobe} in the dwarf cuttlefish is the:\")\n    print(f\"- {posterior_adjacent_region}\")\n\nfind_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain region lying adjacent posteriorly to the Palliovisceral Lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish is the Giant Fibre Lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
