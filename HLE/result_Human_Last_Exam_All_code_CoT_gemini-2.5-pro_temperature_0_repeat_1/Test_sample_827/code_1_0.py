    # Analysis:
    # 1. The reaction is a sequential nucleophilic substitution with tert-butyl hydrazine and benzylamine.
    # 2. The 1H NMR shows fragments for a tert-butyl group (1.70 ppm), a benzylamino group (8.69, 7.37-7.22, 4.73 ppm), and two non-adjacent heteroaromatic protons (singlets at 8.24 and 8.11 ppm).
    # 3. The presence of two non-adjacent protons on the core ring suggests a 4,6-disubstituted pyrimidine (protons at C2 and C5) or a 2,5-disubstituted pyrimidine (protons at C4 and C6).
    # 4. The 13C NMR signal at 102.23 ppm is a key identifier. This upfield shift is highly characteristic of the C5 carbon in a pyrimidine ring, which is shielded by electron-donating substituents at positions C4 and C6.
    # 5. This evidence, combined with the higher reactivity of positions 4 and 6 in nucleophilic substitutions on pyrimidines, strongly indicates a 4,6-disubstitution pattern.
    # 6. Therefore, the final product is 4-(benzylamino)-6-(2-tert-butylhydrazinyl)pyrimidine.
    # 7. The starting material, Compound A, must be the corresponding dichloro-precursor.
