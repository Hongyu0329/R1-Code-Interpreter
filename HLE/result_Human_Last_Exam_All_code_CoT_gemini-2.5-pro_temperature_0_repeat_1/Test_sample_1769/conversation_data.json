    "This is a fascinating question that sits at the intersection of history and linguistics. To figure out what the word \"sister\" might have become, we need to start with the original Old English word and apply the sound changes that occurred in English over the centuries, while ignoring the influence of Old Norse.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for \"sister\". This word is \"sweostor\".\n2.  Identify the Old Norse word that replaced it. This is \"systir\", which gave us our modern \"sister\".\n3.  Trace the likely linguistic evolution of \"sweostor\" into Modern English, based on known sound changes that affected other native English words.\n    *   The Old English diphthong \"eo\" in \"sweostor\" would likely have simplified to \"e\", similar to how \"seofon\" (seven) became \"seven\".\n    *   The rest of the word is phonetically stable and would likely have remained, resulting in a plausible Modern English form.\n4.  I will write a Python script to print out this explanation and the resulting hypothetical word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the hypothetical Modern English word\n    for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    modern_word = \"sister\"\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n\n    print(f\"The modern English word '{modern_word}' is derived from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"Without the Viking invasions, the native Old English word '{old_english_word}' would have evolved naturally.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is its likely linguistic path:\")\n    print(f\"1. Old English (c. 450-1150): The word was 'sweostor'.\")\n\n    # Linguistic change 1: Simplification of the 'eo' diphthong\n    # This is analogous to OE 'seofon' -> ME 'seven'\n    middle_english_word = \"swester\"\n    print(f\"2. Middle English (c. 1150-1500): The 'eo' sound typically simplified to 'e'.\")\n    print(f\"   Therefore, '{old_english_word}' would likely have become '{middle_english_word}'.\")\n\n    # Linguistic change 2: Stability into Modern English\n    # The form 'swester' is phonetically stable and would likely not undergo major changes.\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"swester\"\n    print(f\"3. Modern English (c. 1500-present): The form '{middle_english_word}' would have been very stable.\")\n    print(f\"   It would likely have carried into Modern English as '{hypothetical_modern_word}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis word, or a close variant, still exists in some regional English and Scots dialects.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The hypothetical Modern English word for 'sister' would be:\")\n    print(hypothetical_modern_word)\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    return hypothetical_modern_word\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfinal_answer = find_hypothetical_word()\n# The final answer is returned in the specified format below.\n# For the purpose of this script, we print it here as well.\n# print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
