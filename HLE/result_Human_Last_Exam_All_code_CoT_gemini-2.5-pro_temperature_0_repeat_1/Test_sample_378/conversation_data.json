    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. The former President of Nigeria's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name, and he has never publicly identified himself as such. You may be thinking of Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria.\n\nSince the event you're asking about never occurred, I will provide a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_identification():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's question about when Goodluck Jonathan\n    identified as 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    person_in_question = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    name_in_question = \"Azikiwe\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        f\"The former President of Nigeria's name is {person_in_question}.\\n\"\n        f\"The name '{name_in_question}' is not part of his publicly known name.\\n\"\n        \"Public records do not show any instance of him identifying as 'Azikiwe'.\\n\"\n        \"This is likely a confusion with Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria.\\n\"\n        \"Therefore, there is no year for an event that did not happen.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\ncheck_name_identification()\n```\n<<<The event described in the question never occurred.>>>"
