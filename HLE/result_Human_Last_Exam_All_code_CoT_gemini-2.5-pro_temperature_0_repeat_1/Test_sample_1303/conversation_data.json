    "To find the small molecules that interact with the chemical target `CHEMBL4803817`, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Install necessary library**: First, I will ensure the `chembl_webresource_client` library is available. This library allows programmatic access to the ChEMBL database.\n2.  **Connect to ChEMBL**: I will use the library to connect to the ChEMBL database.\n3.  **Query for Activities**: I will search for all bioactivity data associated with the target ID `CHEMBL4803817`.\n4.  **Filter Results**: To ensure we are looking at meaningful interactions, I will filter the results to include only those with a recorded potency value (`pchembl_value`).\n5.  **Extract and Display Molecules**: From the filtered activity data, I will extract the unique ChEMBL IDs and preferred names of the interacting molecules and print them in a clear list.\n\nYou may need to install the required library first by running: `pip install chembl_webresource_client`\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the client library installed:\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules that have recorded interactions\n    with a given ChEMBL target ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Initialize the client\n        activity = new_client.activity\n\n        print(f\"Searching for small molecule interactions with target: {target_id}...\")\n\n        # Query for activities related to the target, filtering for those with a pChEMBL value\n        # A pChEMBL value indicates a quantitative measure of potency\n        res = activity.filter(target_chembl_id=target_id, pchembl_value__isnull=False).only(\n            ['molecule_chembl_id', 'molecule_pref_name', 'pchembl_value', 'standard_type']\n        )\n\n        if not res:\n            print(f\"No interacting molecules with a pChEMBL value found for {target_id}.\")\n            return\n\n        # Use a dictionary to store unique molecules by their ID to avoid duplicates\n        # and keep their preferred name.\n        interacting_molecules = {}\n        for r in res:\n            # Store the molecule if it's not already there\n            if r['molecule_chembl_id'] not in interacting_molecules:\n                 interacting_molecules[r['molecule_chembl_id']] = r['molecule_pref_name']\n\n        print(f\"\\nFound {len(interacting_molecules)} unique small molecules interacting with {target_id}:\\n\")\n        print(f\"{'ChEMBL ID':<20} {'Preferred Name'}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n        # Print each molecule's ID and name\n        for chembl_id, name in interacting_molecules.items():\n            # If the preferred name is not available, print a placeholder\n            display_name = name if name else \"N/A\"\n            print(f\"{chembl_id:<20} {display_name}\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure you have an internet connection and the ChEMBL services are available.\")\n        print(\"You may also need to install the client library: pip install chembl_webresource_client\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    target_chembl_id = 'CHEMBL4803817'\n    find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id)\n```"
