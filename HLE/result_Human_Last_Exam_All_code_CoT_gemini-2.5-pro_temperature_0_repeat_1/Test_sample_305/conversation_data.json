    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script that systematically counts the number of binary operations that are both associative and commutative on a set of 3 elements.\n\nHere is the plan for the script:\n1.  A binary operation on a set, let's use S = {0, 1, 2}, can be represented by a 3x3 Cayley table (or multiplication table). Each of the 9 cells in the table can be filled with one of the 3 elements.\n2.  The **commutative** property requires that for any two elements `x` and `y` in the set, `x * y = y * x`. This means the Cayley table must be symmetric across its main diagonal. Because of this symmetry, we only need to define the values for the entries on and above the main diagonal. For a set of size n=3, this amounts to `n * (n + 1) / 2 = 3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6` entries.\n3.  Since each of these 6 entries can be any of the 3 elements from the set, the total number of distinct commutative binary operations is `3^6 = 729`.\n4.  The **associative** property requires that for any three elements `x`, `y`, and `z`, the equation `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` must hold.\n5.  The script will generate each of the 729 possible commutative operations. For each one, it will perform a check to see if it is also associative by testing all 27 possible combinations of `(x, y, z)`.\n6.  A counter will be used to tally the number of operations that satisfy both properties.\n7.  Finally, the script will print an explanation of this process along with the final calculated number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of 3 elements by iterating through all possibilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_elements = 3\n    elements = range(num_elements)\n\n    # For a commutative operation on a set of size n, we only need to define\n    # the results for pairs (x, y) where x <= y.
