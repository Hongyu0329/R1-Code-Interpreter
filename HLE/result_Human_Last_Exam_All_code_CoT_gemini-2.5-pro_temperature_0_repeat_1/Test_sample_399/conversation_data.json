    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the initial value problem:\n\n1.  **Solve the Differential Equation:** The given equation $x'(t)=(t-1)x^2(t)$ is a separable differential equation. I will separate the variables $x$ and $t$ to different sides of the equation.\n2.  **Integrate:** I will integrate both sides of the separated equation to find the general solution for $x(t)$.\n3.  **Apply Initial Condition:** I will use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to solve for the constant of integration, which will give the particular solution.\n4.  **Calculate x(1):** Finally, I will substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the value of $x(1)$.\n5.  **Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that performs the final calculation using the `fractions` module to get an exact fractional answer and prints out the steps of the calculation as requested.\n\nHere are the detailed steps of the solution:\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nSeparating the variables, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2}dx = (t-1)dt\n$$\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2}dx = \\int (t-1)dt\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nWe use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the constant $C$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\nSo, the particular solution is:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nSolving for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x} = -\\left(\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\\right) = t - \\frac{t^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{1}{t - \\frac{t^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\nFinally, we find $x(1)$ by substituting $t=1$:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}} = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# This script calculates the value of x(1) based on the derived particular solution\n# x(t) = 1 / (t - t^2/2 - 1/8).\n\n# We need to evaluate this at t=1.\nt = Fraction(1)\n\n# The equation for x(1) is 1 / (1 - 1^2/2 - 1/8)\nval_t = t\nval_t_squared_div_2 = t**2 / 2\nconstant_term = Fraction(1, 8)\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = val_t - val_t_squared_div_2 - constant_term\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = 1 / denominator\n\nprint(\"The particular solution is x(t) = 1 / (t - t^2/2 - 1/8).\")\nprint(\"To find x(1), we substitute t=1 into the equation.\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is: x(1) = 1 / ({val_t} - {val_t}**2/2 - {constant_term})\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculation Steps ---\")\nprint(f\"Denominator = {val_t} - {val_t_squared_div_2} - {constant_term}\")\nprint(f\"Denominator = {val_t - val_t_squared_div_2} - {constant_term}\")\nprint(f\"Denominator = {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 1 / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final value of x(1) is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
