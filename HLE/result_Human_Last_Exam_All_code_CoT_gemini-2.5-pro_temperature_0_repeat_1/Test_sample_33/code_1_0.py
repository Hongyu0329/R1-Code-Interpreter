        The data from the concentration titration is key. The fact that the gelation process
        leads to an increase in the signal for both alpha-helices (at {1652} cm^-1) and
        beta-sheets (at {1618} cm^-1) indicates that the initially disordered protein
        is folding into a final structure that contains both of these elements.

        The heating experiment further supports this by showing that the ordered structures
        (beta-sheets at {1618} and {1680} cm^-1) are lost upon heating, causing the protein
        to revert to a disordered state (increase in the {1645} cm^-1 peak).

        Therefore, the most accurate explanation is that the disordered structures fold into
        both beta sheets and alpha helices upon gelation.
