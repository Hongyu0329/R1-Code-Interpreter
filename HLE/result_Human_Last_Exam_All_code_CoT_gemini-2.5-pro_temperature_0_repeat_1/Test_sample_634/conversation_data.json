    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use a method analogous to the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Form a stacked matrix**: Create a new matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    `M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]`\n2.  **Apply elementary row operations**: Reduce the matrix `M` to its row-echelon form. The allowed elementary row operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Identify the GCRD**: The non-zero rows of the final reduced matrix form the GCRD.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics. It will perform the row reduction step-by-step and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two \n    polynomial matrices P1 and P2 using elementary row operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sympy.symbols('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*30 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Perform row reduction to find the GCRD\n    # Create a copy to modify\n    M_reduced = M.copy()\n\n    # R1 <-> R3 to get a simpler pivot\n    M_reduced.row_swap(0, 2)\n    # R2_new = R2 + s*R1\n    M_reduced[1, :] += s * M_reduced.row(0)\n    # R3_new = R3 - (s+1)*R1\n    M_reduced[2, :] -= (s + 1) * M_reduced.row(0)\n    # R4_new = R4 + R1\n    M_reduced[3, :] += M_reduced.row(0)\n    \n    # Now M_reduced is [[s, 0], [-1, s^2], [0, -s], [-1, 1]]\n    # R1 <-> R4 to get a constant pivot\n    M_reduced.row_swap(0, 3)\n    \n    # Now M_reduced is [[-1, 1], [-1, s^2], [0, -s], [s, 0]]\n    # R2_new = R2 - R1\n    M_reduced[1, :] -= M_reduced.row(0)\n    # R4_new = R4 + s*R1\n    M_reduced[3, :] += s * M_reduced.row(0)\n\n    # Now M_reduced is [[-1, 1], [0, s^2-1], [0, -s], [0, s]]\n    # R3_new = R3 + R4\n    M_reduced[2, :] += M_reduced.row(3)\n\n    # Now M_reduced is [[-1, 1], [0, s^2-1], [0, 0], [0, s]]\n    # R2_new = R2 - s*R4\n    M_reduced[1, :] -= s * M_reduced.row(3)\n\n    # Now M_reduced is [[-1, 1], [0, -1], [0, 0], [0, s]]\n    # R1_new = R1 + R2\n    M_reduced[0, :] += M_reduced.row(1)\n    # R4_new = R4 + s*R2\n    M_reduced[3, :] += s * M_reduced.row(1)\n\n    # Now M_reduced is [[-1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    print(\"Step 2: After performing elementary row operations, the matrix becomes:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M_reduced)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: The non-zero rows form the GCRD.
