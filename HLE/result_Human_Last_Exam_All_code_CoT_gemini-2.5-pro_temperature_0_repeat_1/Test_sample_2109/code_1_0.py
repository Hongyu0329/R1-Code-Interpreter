# Step 1: Define the values for the integrals based on the plan.
# Integral of T1(sqrt(2)*x) from 0 to 1 is 1 - pi/4.
I1_mod = 1 - np.pi / 4

# Integral of T2(x) from 0 to 1, corresponding to the minimum energy, is -4/3.
I2 = -4.0 / 3.0

# Step 2: Calculate the total energy using the formula:
# E_total = 1 + 0.5 * I1_mod + 0.5 * I2
E_total = 1 + 0.5 * I1_mod + 0.5 * I2

# Step 3: Display the result, showing the components of the final calculation.
# The analytical expression for the energy is 5/6 - pi/8.
