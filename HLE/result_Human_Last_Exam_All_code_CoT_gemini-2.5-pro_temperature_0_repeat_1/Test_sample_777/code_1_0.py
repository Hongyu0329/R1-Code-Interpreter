# This problem asks for a complexity-theoretic result, not a computational solution.
# The user is asked to identify the correct statement about the complexity of the DisjointCycles problem.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis, the problem is:
# - Fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphs.
# - W[1]-complete on general graphs.
# This corresponds to answer choice B.

# The final answer is a character representing the choice.
# No code execution is needed to determine the answer, but the format requires a code block.

    Analyzes the complexity of the DisjointCycles problem.

    Problem: DisjointCycles
    Input: A graph G and a positive integer k
    Parameter: k
    Output: 1 if G contains at least k vertex-disjoint simple cycles,
            each of length at least k. 0 otherwise.

    Analysis:
    1.  On general graphs, the problem is known to be W[1]-complete. A standard FPT
        argument based on treewidth and grid minors fails because lifting a long
        cycle from a minor does not guarantee a long simple cycle in the original
        graph. The problem can be shown to be W[1]-hard via a reduction from k-Clique.

    2.  On planar graphs, the problem becomes easier due to the graph's structural
        constraints. It is known to be fixed-parameter tractable. An algorithm
        exists that solves it in FPT time (e.g., 2^O(k) * n^O(1)).

    Conclusion:
    The statement that correctly describes this situation is:
    B. DisjointCycles is fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphs, but W[1]-complete on general graphs.
