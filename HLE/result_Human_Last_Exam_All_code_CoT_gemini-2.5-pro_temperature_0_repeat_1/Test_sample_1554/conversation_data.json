    "My plan is to first identify the correct philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School based on the specific philosophical distinction mentioned. The distinction between \"symptoms\" (natural signs) and \"signals\" (conventional signs) as types of \"hallmarks\" is a key concept in the semiotic and epistemological work of a particular member of this school. After identifying the philosopher, I will write a simple Python script to print out the answer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher\n    who distinguished between symptoms and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    explanation = \"decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who {explanation} is: {philosopher}\")\n\nfind_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
