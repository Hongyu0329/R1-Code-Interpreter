    "To determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches, we need to compare the frequency of the sound produced by muscle twitches with the hearing range of each animal.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Establish the frequency range for the sound of human muscle twitches. This is a very low-frequency sound, often in the infrasound range.\n2.  List the known hearing frequency ranges for each animal provided in the answer choices.\n3.  Compare the muscle twitch frequency with each animal's hearing range to find the best match.\n4.  The animal whose hearing range comfortably includes the frequency of muscle twitches is the correct answer.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan by defining the frequencies and printing a step-by-step comparison.\n\n```python\ndef solve_animal_hearing_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes which animal can hear human muscle twitches\n    by comparing frequency ranges.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of human muscle twitches.\n    # Muscle contractions produce very low-frequency sounds (mechanomyography).\n    muscle_twitch_min_hz = 5\n    muscle_twitch_max_hz = 50\n    print(f\"The sound from human muscle twitches is a very low-frequency vibration, typically in the range of {muscle_twitch_min_hz}-{muscle_twitch_max_hz} Hz.\")\n    print(\"This is mostly in the infrasound range (below 20 Hz).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Define and compare the hearing ranges for each animal.\n    print(\"Let's examine the hearing range of each animal:\")\n\n    # A. Dog\n    dog_min_hz = 67\n    print(f\"\\nA. Dog: Hearing range is approximately {dog_min_hz}-45,000 Hz.\")\n    print(f\"   Comparison: The dog's lower limit of {dog_min_hz} Hz is too high to detect a {muscle_twitch_min_hz}-{muscle_twitch_max_hz} Hz twitch.\")\n\n    # B. Bat\n    bat_min_hz = 20000  # Bats are specialized for ultrasound.\n    print(f\"\\nB. Bat: Hearing is specialized for high frequencies, often starting around {bat_min_hz} Hz.\")\n    print(f\"   Comparison: Bats cannot hear the very low frequencies of muscle twitches.\")\n\n    # C. Herring\n    herring_min_hz = 1  # Herrings have specialized ears for infrasound.\n    print(f\"\\nC. Herring: This fish has a unique ear structure making it sensitive to infrasound, down to as low as {herring_min_hz} Hz.\")\n    print(f\"   Comparison: The herring's range easily covers the {muscle_twitch_min_hz}-{muscle_twitch_max_hz} Hz of a muscle twitch.\")\n\n    # D. Whale\n    whale_min_hz = 10  # Baleen whales hear low frequencies.\n    print(f\"\\nD. Whale: Baleen whales can hear low frequencies, down to about {whale_min_hz} Hz.\")\n    print(f\"   Comparison: A whale's hearing overlaps with the twitch frequency, making it a possibility.\")\n\n    # E. Human\n    human_min_hz = 20\n    print(f\"\\nE. Human: Hearing range is approximately {human_min_hz}-20,000 Hz.\")\n    print(f\"   Comparison: The sound of a muscle twitch is mostly below the {human_min_hz} Hz lower limit of human hearing.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 4: Conclusion\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"While a whale's hearing range overlaps, the Herring is famously equipped to detect extremely low-frequency pressure waves.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the Herring is the most likely animal on this list to be able to hear human muscle twitches.\")\n\nsolve_animal_hearing_question()\n<<<C>>>"
