    "The problem asks for the largest possible number of connected components in the intersection of two closed, connected sets whose union is the unit square.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the problem:** We are looking for two sets, A and B, in the plane with the following properties:\n    *   A is closed and connected.\n    *   B is closed and connected.\n    *   A ∪ B = [0, 1] x [0, 1] (the unit square).\n    *   We want to maximize the number of connected components of A ∩ B.\n\n2.  **Develop a construction:** It turns out that any finite number of components can be achieved. This means there is no largest finite number. The answer is therefore infinity. I will demonstrate this by constructing sets A and B that result in an intersection with `k` components, for any given integer `k ≥ 1`.\n\n3.  **The Construction Method:**\n    *   We will split the square into three vertical sections: a left spine region, a right spine region, and a middle region.\n    *   Set A will consist of the left spine and a series of horizontal strips in the middle region.\n    *   Set B will consist of the right spine and the remaining horizontal strips in the middle region.\n    *   The spines ensure that both A and B are connected.\n    *   By carefully choosing the strips, we can make their union (along with the spines) cover the entire square.\n    *   The intersection of A and B will occur at the boundaries between their respective strips in the middle region. These boundaries will be disjoint horizontal line segments, and we can create `k` of them.\n\n4.  **Python Code:** I will write a Python script that takes an integer `k` as input and prints the geometric definitions of the sets A and B, and their intersection, which has `k` components. This will serve as a proof by construction that any number `k` is possible.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_topology_problem(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that for any integer k >= 1, we can construct\n    two closed, connected sets A and B whose union is the unit square,\n    and whose intersection has k connected components.\n\n    Args:\n        k (int): The desired number of connected components in the intersection.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(k, int) or k < 1:\n        print(\"Please provide an integer k >= 1.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"--- Construction for k = {k} components ---\")\n\n    # To get k components in the intersection, we need k+1 strips in the middle.\n    n = k + 1\n\n    # Use fractions for precision\n    one_third = fractions.Fraction(1, 3)\n    two_thirds = fractions.Fraction(2, 3)\n\n    # --- Define Set A ---\n    print(\"\\nSet A is the union of the following closed rectangles:\")\n    # The \"spine\" of A ensures it is connected.\n    print(f\"  - A_spine = [0, {one_third}] x [0, 1]\")\n    # The \"strips\" of A in the middle section.\n    # A takes the 1st, 3rd, 5th, ... strips.\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 != 0: # Odd-numbered strips\n            y_bottom = fractions.Fraction(i - 1, n)\n            y_top = fractions.Fraction(i, n)\n            print(f\"  - A_strip_{i} = [{one_third}, {two_thirds}] x [{y_bottom}, {y_top}]\")\n\n    # --- Define Set B ---\n    print(\"\\nSet B is the union of the following closed rectangles:\")\n    # The \"spine\" of B ensures it is connected.\n    print(f\"  - B_spine = [{two_thirds}, 1] x [0, 1]\")\n    # The \"strips\" of B in the middle section.\n    # B takes the 2nd, 4th, 6th, ... strips.\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0: # Even-numbered strips\n            y_bottom = fractions.Fraction(i - 1, n)\n            y_top = fractions.Fraction(i, n)\n            print(f\"  - B_strip_{i} = [{one_third}, {two_thirds}] x [{y_bottom}, {y_top}]\")\n\n    # --- Define the Intersection A_intersect_B ---\n    print(f\"\\nThe intersection A \\u2229 B has {k} connected components.\")\n    print(\"These components are the horizontal boundaries between the strips:\")\n    # The intersection consists of k horizontal line segments.\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        y_level = fractions.Fraction(i, n)\n        print(f\"  - C_{i} = [{one_third}, {two_thirds}] x {{{y_level}}}\")\n\n# Example: Show the construction for 4 components.\n# You can change this number to see the construction for any k.\nnumber_of_components = 4\nsolve_topology_problem(number_of_components)\n```\n<<<inf>>>"
