    "This task requires tracing a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb through its sound changes into Proto-Germanic and then into its daughter languages: Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German. This process involves applying several well-established sound laws.\n\n**Here is the step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Proto-Indo-European (PIE):** We start with `*seh₂gieti`.\n    *   The root is `*seh₂g-`. The laryngeal `*h₂` colors the preceding `*e` to `*a` and then vanishes, giving the root form `*sāg-`.\n    *   In the transition to Proto-Germanic, the PIE long vowel `*ā` becomes `*ō`.\n    *   According to Grimm's Law, the PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   The PIE `ye-present` verb ending `*-ieti` becomes the Class 1 weak verb 3rd person singular ending `*-iþ` in Proto-Germanic.\n\n2.  **Proto-Germanic (PGmc):** Applying the changes above, `*seh₂gieti` becomes `*sōkiþ`. This is the direct ancestor of the words in the daughter languages.\n\n3.  **Daughter Languages:**\n    *   **Old Norse (ON):** The `*i` in the PGmc ending `*-iþ` causes i-umlaut, changing the root vowel `*ō` to `ø`. The ending itself evolves to `-ir`. This results in **`søkir`**.\n    *   **Old English (OE):** The `*i` also causes i-umlaut, changing `*ō` to `ē`. The consonant `*k` is then palatalized to `ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/) because it is followed by this new front vowel. The ending becomes `-eþ`. This results in **`sēċeþ`**.\n    *   **Old High German (OHG):** Here, i-umlaut does not affect `*ō`. Instead, the vowel breaks into the diphthong `uo`. The High German Consonant Shift changes `*k` to the fricative `hh` (/x/). The ending becomes `-it`. This results in **`suohhit`**.\n\nThe following Python code will print out this etymological chain.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the etymological derivation of a PIE word\n    through Germanic languages.\n    \"\"\"\n    pie_form = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    pgmc_form = \"*sōkiþ\"\n    on_form = \"søkir\"\n    oe_form = \"sēċeþ\"\n    ohg_form = \"suohhit\"\n\n    print(f\"The derivation from PIE {pie_form} '(s)he seeks/gives a sign' is as follows:\\n\")\n\n    # Print each stage of the derivation\n    print(f\"1.
