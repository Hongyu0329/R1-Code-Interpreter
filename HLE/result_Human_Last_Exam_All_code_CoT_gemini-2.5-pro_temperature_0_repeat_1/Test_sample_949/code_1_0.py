    This function provides the final result based on a detailed mathematical analysis
    of the properties of well-formed parenthesis strings.

    The analysis concludes that all six statements are true. The reasoning is as follows:

    1.  A key inequality is L(x) >= 2*D(x) for any pair x.
    2.  The clarification about log(t) being max(1, log(t)) is crucial. It ensures that
        pairs with D(x)=1 still contribute positively to the sums on the right-hand side.
    3.  Testing against "fat" strings (like `(()()...())`) shows that the sums are
        dominated by the large number of simple `()` pairs. Because all functions
        in the statements are sub-linear, the ratio of the left-hand side to the
        right-hand side converges to a constant.
    4.  Testing against "thin" strings (like `((...()))`) also shows the statements hold,
        as L(x) is proportional to D(x), and the functions/exponents are chosen
        such that the O-notation condition is met.

    Since the statements hold for the most extreme structural cases, we conclude they
    are true for all well-formed strings.
