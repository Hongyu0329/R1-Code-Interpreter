The proposed research approach is not valid for assessing functional mimicry syndromes. The ecological function of this type of mimicry is to deter natural predators, whose visual systems (e.g., a bird's ability to see UV light) are different from humans. Therefore, similarity rankings by humans, especially untrained ones, are not an appropriate proxy for how a predator perceives the warning signals. The resulting clusters would reflect human aesthetic judgment rather than the ecologically relevant groupings that have evolved under predator selection pressure.
