    "This is a theoretical question from abstract algebra. To answer it, we need to rely on established mathematical theorems rather than direct computation. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the key terms**: I will first clarify the definitions of a \"product-free set,\" a \"filled group,\" and a \"nilpotent group\" to establish the context.\n2.  **State the relevant theorem**: The classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is a specific case of a more general theorem concerning finite solvable groups. I will state this theorem, which provides the core of the answer.\n3.  **Apply the theorem to nilpotent groups**: I will explain how the general theorem for solvable groups applies directly to nilpotent groups (since all finite nilpotent groups are solvable).\n4.  **Formulate the final characterization**: This will lead to a clear and concise description of the finite nilpotent groups that are \"filled\".\n5.  **Provide a Python script**: As requested, I will provide a Python script. Since the problem is theoretical, the script will not perform a calculation but will print the detailed explanation and the final answer, including the specific equation that defines the condition.\n\nHere is the Python code that explains and presents the solution.\n\n```python\ndef get_filled_nilpotent_group_characterization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the mathematical reasoning and provides the final\n    characterization of finite filled nilpotent groups.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    title = \"Characterization of Finite Filled Nilpotent Groups\"\n    print(title)\n    print(\"-\" * len(title))\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understanding the Definitions\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"  - Product-Free Set: A subset S of a group G is product-free if for any two elements x, y in S (not necessarily distinct), their product xy is NOT in S.\")\n    print(\"  - Maximal Product-Free Set (MIPS): A product-free set that cannot be made any larger by adding elements from G.\")\n    print(\"  - Filled Group: A group G is called 'filled' if the union of all its MIPSs is the entire group G.\")\n    print(\"  - Finite Nilpotent Group: A finite group that is equivalent to the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The Decisive Theorem\")\n    print(\"------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The solution comes from a known result in group theory.
