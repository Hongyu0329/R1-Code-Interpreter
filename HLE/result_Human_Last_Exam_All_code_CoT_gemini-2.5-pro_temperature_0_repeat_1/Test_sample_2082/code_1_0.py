        "1. Muscle Contraction: Calcium ions entering smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels cause them to contract, narrowing the vessels (vasoconstriction) and increasing blood pressure.\n"
        "2. Magnesium's Role: Magnesium competes with calcium and blocks its entry into these smooth muscle cells.\n"
        "3. Result (Vasodilation): With less calcium entering the cells, the smooth muscles relax. This causes the blood vessels to widen, a process called vasodilation.\n"
        "4. Lowered Blood Pressure: Vasodilation reduces the resistance to blood flow, which directly results in a decrease in blood pressure.\n\n"
        "Therefore, the correct mechanism is direct vasodilation."
