    "To solve this problem, we need to find a 2x2 state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are at the desired locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** First, we determine the characteristic polynomial that corresponds to the desired eigenvalues. For eigenvalues `p1` and `p2`, the polynomial is `(s - p1)(s - p2) = 0`.\n    For `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`, the polynomial is `(s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j)) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n\n2.  **System Characteristic Polynomial:** Next, we find the characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system `A + BF` in terms of the unknown elements of `F`. Let `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`. The resulting symbolic polynomial will have its coefficients expressed in terms of `f1, f2, f3, f4`.\n\n3.  **Solve for F:** This gives us a system of 2 equations (from the coefficients of `s` and the constant term) with 4 unknowns. This means there are infinite solutions. To find one valid solution, we can simplify the problem by assuming a simpler structure for `F`. A common approach is to set some elements of `F` to zero. We will assume `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This reduces the problem to solving a system of 2 linear equations for the 2 unknowns `f1` and `f2`.\n\n4.  **Verification:** Once we find a matrix `F`, we will calculate the eigenvalues of `A + BF` to confirm they are at the desired locations.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_state_feedback():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system (A, B)\n    to place the closed-loop eigenvalues at desired locations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices\n    A = np.array([[-1, 1], [1, 0]])\n    B = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 0]])\n\n    # Define the desired eigenvalues (poles)\n    # The desired characteristic polynomial is s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0.\n    \n    # We need to find F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] such that A+BF has the desired eigenvalues.\n    # This leads to 2 equations for 4 unknowns, so there are infinite solutions.\n    # We will find one solution by assuming f3=0 and f4=0.\n    \n    # The characteristic polynomial of A+BF with F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]] is:\n    # s^2 - (f1 + f2 - 1)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2) = 0\n    \n    # By comparing coefficients with the desired s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0, we get:\n    # 1) -(f1 + f2 - 1) = 2  =>  f1 + f2 = -1\n    # 2) -1 - f1 - 2*f2 = 2  =>  f1 + 2*f2 = -3\n    \n    # We solve this system of linear equations: M * x = v\n    M = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2]])\n    v = np.array([-1, -3])\n    \n    # Solve for x = [f1, f2]\n    f1_f2 = np.linalg.solve(M, v)\n    \n    # Construct the full gain matrix F\n    F = np.array([[f1_f2[0], f1_f2[1]], [0.0, 0.0]])\n    \n    print(\"The calculated state feedback gain matrix F is:\")\n    print(F)\n    \n    # Verification\n    A_cl = A + B @ F\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Verification ---\")\n    print(\"The final equation A + B*F = A_cl is:\")\n    print(f\"{A}\\n+\\n{B} @ {F}\\n=\\n{A_cl}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe eigenvalues of the resulting closed-loop system A + BF are:\")\n    # Use np.round to clean up floating point inaccuracies\n    print(np.round(eigenvalues, 5))\n    print(\"These match the desired eigenvalues of -1+j and -1-j.\")\n\nsolve_state_feedback()\n<<<[[1. -2.]\n [0.  0.]]>>>\n```"
