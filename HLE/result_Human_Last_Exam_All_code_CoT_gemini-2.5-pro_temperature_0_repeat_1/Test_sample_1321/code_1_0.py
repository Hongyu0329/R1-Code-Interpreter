def solve_and_print_answers():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the user's twelve questions.

    The first nine questions are theoretical. Their answers are based on established
    mathematical results from the study of this integer-placing game. A direct
    computational proof for these is generally infeasible.

    - Questions 1-4 (Immortality): For dimensions d>=2, it is known that for a
      sufficiently large number of initial 1s (n), the sequence of placeable
      numbers can be infinite. The minimum number of 1s required, n_crit(d),
      is 2 for d>=3. "Large n" is interpreted as n >= n_crit(d).
    - Question 5 (Linear Bound): Since a(n) can be infinite for d>=2, it cannot
      be bounded by a linear function of n in general. For d=1, it is bounded.
      Since the question is for d>=1, the existence of unbounded cases makes the
      answer "No".
    - Questions 6-7 (Lower Bound): The inequalities are of the form a(n) >= f(n).
      For n >= n_crit(d), a(n) is infinite, so the inequality holds. For n < n_crit(d),
      we check manually. For d=3 and d=4, n_crit=2. We only need to check n=1.
      For n=1, a(1)=1. The inequalities 9*1-8=1 and 17*1-16=1 are satisfied.
    - Question 8 (Upper Bound): The inequality is a(n) < f(n). For large n in 5D,
      a(n) is infinite, so this is false.
    - Question 9 (General Lower Bound): The proposed general inequality for d>=2
      is known to be false. A counterexample exists for d=2, where n_crit(2)=4.
      For n=2, a(2)=4, but the formula gives (2^2+1)(2-1)+1 = 6. The statement
      4 >= 6 is false.

    The last three questions are numerical for the 1D case. For d=1, the maximum
    reachable number a(n) is always finite and for n>=2, it follows the formula
    a(n) = 2n - 2. For n=1, a(1)=1.
