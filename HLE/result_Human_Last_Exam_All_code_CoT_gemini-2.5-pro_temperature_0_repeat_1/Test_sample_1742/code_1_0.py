    """
    This script finds the unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice
    for the path algebra A = C(1 -> 2 -> 3).

    For this algebra (hereditary, type A3), tau-tilting modules are the same as
    tilting modules. We can identify them using a non-crossing interval criterion.
    The indecomposable modules are represented by intervals [i, j] where 1 <= i <= j <= 3.
    - S1: [1,1], S2: [2,2], S3: [3,3]
    - I2: [1,2] (module over vertices 1,2)
    - P2: [2,3] (module over vertices 2,3)
    - P1: [1,3] (module over vertices 1,2,3)

    A slice module corresponds to a tilting module whose associated triangulation
    of a pentagon (for A3) is a "fan" (all diagonals share a vertex).

    The script will:
    1. Define all indecomposable modules as intervals.
    2. Find all combinations of 3 modules.
    3. Filter these to find the 5 tilting modules using the non-crossing criterion.
    4. Filter the tilting modules to find those that are not slices using the fan triangulation criterion.
    5. Among the non-slice modules, select the most canonical one as the unique answer.
