    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, as in other formulations of quantum many-body theory, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a particle in the absence of interactions. The functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is most clearly expressed in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first explain the physical context and the meaning of the terms involved. The bare Green's function $G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the time-ordered propagator for a particle with momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ and energy (frequency) $\\omega$. The term $\\epsilon_k$ represents the energy of a single-particle quantum state with momentum $\\mathbf{k}$.\n2.  The core of the relationship is that the Green's function has a pole when the particle's energy $\\omega$ matches the energy of an available eigenstate $\\epsilon_k$. This leads to an inverse relationship.\n3.  The full expression is $G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$. I will explain the role of the infinitesimal term $i\\delta$, which is crucial for enforcing causality and depends on whether the state is occupied or not.\n4.  Finally, I will provide a Python script to print out this fundamental equation, defining each symbol and then combining them into the final formula, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_green_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the bare Green's function,\n    showing its dependence on single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbols used in the equation as string variables\n    # for clear presentation.\n    green_function = \"G_0(k, ω)\"\n    frequency = \"ω\"\n    energy_eigenvalue = \"ϵ_k\"\n    infinitesimal = \"iδ\"\n    numerator = \"1\"\n\n    # Explain the context and the components of the formula\n    print(\"In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function (G_0) describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle.\")\n    print(\"Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k) in frequency-momentum space is given by the following relation:\\n\")\n\n    # Print each component of the equation as requested\n    print(\"--- Equation Components ---\")\n    print(f\"Numerator: {numerator}\")\n    print(f\"Frequency variable: {frequency}\")\n    print(f\"Single-particle energy eigenvalue: {energy_eigenvalue}\")\n    print(f\"Infinitesimal for causality: {infinitesimal}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # Construct and print the final equation\n    denominator = f\"({frequency} - {energy_eigenvalue} + {infinitesimal})\"\n    equation = f\"{green_function} = {numerator} / {denominator}\"\n\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(equation)\n\n    # Provide an explanation of the terms\n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(f\" - {green_function}: The bare Green's function for a particle with momentum 'k' and frequency 'ω'.\")\n    print(f\" - {frequency}: The energy (frequency) of the propagating particle.\")\n    print(f\" - {energy_eigenvalue}: The energy of the single-particle eigenstate with momentum 'k'.
