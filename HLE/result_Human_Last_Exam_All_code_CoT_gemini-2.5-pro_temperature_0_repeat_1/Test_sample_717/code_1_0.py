# This script determines the value of 'n' based on the provided mathematical problem.
# The problem describes a scenario in the representation theory of posets.

# Step 1: The problem states that F is a "tame" functor.
# Step 2: The existence of an exact functor f^k from a category based on a finite
# poset I implies that the projective dimension of F must be finite.
# This rules out tame representation categories of infinite global dimension.
# Step 3: We are left with tame categories of finite global dimension. The most
# prominent classes are tame hereditary (global dimension 1) and tame canonical
# algebras (global dimension at most 2).
# Step 4: Since the problem is stated for a general "tame" functor, not a
# more specific "tame hereditary" one, it points towards the more general
# case. The canonical algebras are the fundamental example of non-hereditary
# tame algebras with finite global dimension.
# Step 5: For a canonical algebra, the global dimension is at most 2. This means
# any representation F has a projective dimension of at most 2.
# Thus, F is 2-resolvable.

# The final equation is n = 2.
n = 2

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The only number in the equation "n = 2" is 2.
