# Step 1: Determine c1
# The reciprocal concept to "logical depth" is "sophistication".
# The third letter of "sophistication" is 'p'.
word1 = "sophistication"
c1 = word1[2]

# Step 2: Determine c2
# The missing word in Murray Gell-Mann's quote "the two _ didn't commute" is "options".
# The third letter of "options" is 't'.
word2 = "options"
c2 = word2[2]

# Step 3: Determine c3, which leads to c4
# The last author of the GELU paper is Kevin Gimpel.
# The last letter of "Gimpel" is 'l'. This is c3.
c3 = "Gimpel"[-1]
# c4 is the Rot13 of c3 ('l'), which is 'y'.
c4 = codecs.encode(c3, 'rot_13')

# Step 4: Determine c5
# Mars is closer in mass to the Moon than to the Earth.
# The second letter of "Moon" is 'o'.
word5 = "Moon"
c5 = word5[1]

# Step 5: Concatenate the characters and print the final "equation" and result.
