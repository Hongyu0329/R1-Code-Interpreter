    "Of course. Here is a Python script that explains the two problems with the JTB definition of knowledge, as requested.\n\nMy plan is to address your philosophical question using a Python script, as you've specified. The script will not perform a calculation but will use `print()` statements to output a clear, step-by-step explanation of the two requested problems with the JTB theory, excluding Gettier problems.\n\n1.  **Problem 1: The Regress of Justification.** I will explain how the \"Justified\" component of JTB leads to an infinite regress, as any justification requires its own justification.\n2.  **Problem 2: The Gap Between Justification and Truth.** I will explain the issue of fallibility, where a belief can be strongly justified by all available evidence but still be false, making the \"True\" component problematic for the believer to confirm.\n\nHere is the Python script:\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines two fundamental problems with the JTB (Justified True Belief)\n    definition of knowledge, excluding Gettier problems.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Assuming the JTB definition of Knowledge (Justified True Belief), two major problems arise, even when ignoring Gettier cases:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 80)\n\n    # Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification\n    print(\"\\nProblem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification\\n\")\n    print(\"The 'J' (Justification) in JTB is not self-sufficient. The issue is as follows:\")\n    print(\"  - For a belief to be considered 'justified', it must be supported by evidence or another reason (a justifier).\")\n    print(\"  - However, that justifier must *also* be justified for it to provide valid support.\")\n    print(\"  - This creates an infinite chain, or regress: Belief B1 is justified by B2, which must be justified by B3, and so on, forever.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe JTB model itself does not solve this problem. It doesn't specify how to ground the chain of justification, leaving it unclear if any belief can ever be fully 'justified' in a non-circular or non-infinite way.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\" * 80)\n\n    # Problem 2: The Gap Between Justification and Truth (The Problem of Fallibility)\n    print(\"\\nProblem 2: The Gap Between Justification and Truth (The Problem of Fallibility)\\n\")\n    print(\"The JTB model requires a belief to be objectively 'T' (True), but our access to truth is only through fallible justification. The issue is as follows:\")\n    print(\"  - A belief can be very strongly justified based on all available evidence, yet still be false.\")\n    print(\"  - Example: For centuries, the belief that the sun orbited the Earth was well-justified by the best available astronomical observations. It was a Justified Belief, but it was false and therefore not Knowledge.\")\n    print(\"  - This reveals a fundamental gap: Justification does not guarantee truth.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe believer can never step outside their own mind to independently verify that the 'Truth' condition is met. They can only ever confirm their 'Justification'. This makes the 'T' condition something a person can never be certain of, making it problematic to confirm when one actually possesses 'Knowledge'.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<The two problems are 1) The Regress Problem of Justification, where any justification requires its own justification, leading to an infinite regress, and 2) The Problem of Fallibility, where justification does not guarantee truth, meaning a well-justified belief can still be false.>>>"
