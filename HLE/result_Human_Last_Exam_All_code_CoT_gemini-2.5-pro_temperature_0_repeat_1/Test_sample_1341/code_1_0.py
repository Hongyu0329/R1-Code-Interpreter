# Define the financial details from the agreement
total_price = 3000

# --- Step 1: Calculate the total amount paid by Jack ---
total_paid = payments_made_count * payment_amount

print(f"The fraction of the total price paid is: ${total_paid} (paid) / ${total_price} (total) = {fraction_paid:.2f}")

print("1. Missed Payment: Jack missed the February 1 payment. (Default event occurred)")
print("2. Written Notice: The contract requires 'written notice of default'.")
print("3. Action Taken: Gary sent a text message stating Jack 'missed a payment'.")
print("\nConclusion:")
print("A simple text message is likely insufficient to be considered a formal 'written notice of default' as required by the contract. A formal notice typically needs to be unambiguous, state that the contract is in default, and outline the consequences. Because proper notice was not given, the three-day period for Jack to fix the default was never officially started.")
print("\nTherefore, Gary is not yet entitled to retake possession of the vehicle because he did not follow the agreed-upon procedure for providing notice.")
