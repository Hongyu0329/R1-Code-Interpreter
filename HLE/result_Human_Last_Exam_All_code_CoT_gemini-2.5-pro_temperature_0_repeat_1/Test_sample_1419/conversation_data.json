    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Theoretical Framework:** The problem asks for the fixed point coupling in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions. This is a classic problem in the study of critical phenomena and quantum field theory, solved using the Renormalization Group (RG).\n2.  **State the Beta Function:** The core of the RG analysis is the beta function, $\\beta(u)$, which describes the running of the dimensionless coupling constant $u$ with the energy scale. For $\\phi^4$ theory in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions, the one-loop beta function is given by:\n    $\\beta(u) = - \\epsilon u + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^2 + O(u^3)$\n3.  **Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point, denoted by $u^*$, is a value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant, meaning the beta function is zero: $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n4.  **Solve the Equation:** We will solve the equation $\\beta(u^*) = 0$ to find the expression for $u^*$. This equation has a trivial solution ($u^*=0$, the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial one (the Wilson-Fisher fixed point), which is the one we are interested in. The expression for $u^*$ will be in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n5.  **Python Implementation:** I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculation. The script will define the beta function, solve for its roots, and print the non-trivial solution in a clear format, showing all the numbers and symbols in the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling\n    u* in phi^4 theory near four dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables for the coupling 'u' and the dimensional parameter 'epsilon'.\n    u, epsilon = sp.symbols('u epsilon')\n    pi = sp.pi\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the one-loop beta function for phi^4 theory in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions.\")\n    # The beta function is beta(u) = -epsilon*u + (3 * u^2) / (16 * pi^2)\n    # We represent the coefficient as a symbolic fraction for clarity.\n    coefficient = sp.Rational(3, 16) * (1 / pi**2)\n    beta_function = -epsilon * u + coefficient * u**2\n    \n    print(\"The beta function is:\")\n    # Using sympy's pretty print for a nice mathematical layout.\n    sp.pprint(sp.Eq(sp.Symbol('beta(u)'), beta_function), use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Find the fixed point u* by solving the equation beta(u*) = 0.\")\n    # A fixed point u* satisfies the condition beta(u*) = 0.\n    fixed_point_eq = sp.Eq(beta_function, 0)\n    \n    print(\"The equation to solve is:\")\n    sp.pprint(fixed_point_eq, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Solve the equation for u.\")\n    # Solve the equation for the variable u.\n    solutions = sp.solve(fixed_point_eq, u)\n    \n    # The solutions are the fixed points.\n    gaussian_fp = solutions[0]\n    wilson_fisher_fp = solutions[1]\n\n    print(f\"The equation has two solutions (fixed points):\")\n    print(f\"1.
