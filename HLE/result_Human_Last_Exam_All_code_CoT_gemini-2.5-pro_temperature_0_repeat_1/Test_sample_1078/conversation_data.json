    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we can use the classification of finite Coxeter groups. A Weyl group of a given rank is either irreducible (its Dynkin diagram is connected) or reducible (it is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups of smaller ranks). The rank of a direct product is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the number of irreducible finite Weyl groups for each rank from 1 to 4. These are given by the connected Dynkin diagrams (A_n, B_n, D_n, E_n, F_4, G_2).\n2.  Consider all the ways the integer 4 can be partitioned into smaller positive integers (e.g., 4, 3+1, 2+2, etc.). Each partition corresponds to a possible structure for a rank 4 Weyl group.\n3.  For each partition, calculate the number of distinct Weyl groups that can be formed. This involves using combinations, particularly combinations with repetition when a partition has identical parts (like 2+2).\n4.  Sum the counts for all partitions to get the total number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out this calculation, explaining each step and printing the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n    This is determined by considering all partitions of the number 4.
