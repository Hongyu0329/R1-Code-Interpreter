    "An ampule is a sealed glass container that, once broken open, cannot be resealed. As a single-dose container without antimicrobial preservatives, its handling is governed by strict sterile compounding standards to prevent microbial contamination.\n\nMy plan is to provide the answer based on the guidelines from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>, which sets the standards for sterile preparations. I will write a simple python script to print out the explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_single_dose_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose\n    container like an ampule when opened in a sterile environment, based on\n    USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to USP <797>, a single-dose container is one intended for a single use\n    # and typically lacks an antimicrobial preservative.\n    # An ampule is a prime example.\n    \n    # The environment specified is \"sterile,\" which corresponds to an\n    # ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment in pharmacy practice.\n    \n    # The BUD for a single-dose container (vial, ampule, etc.) that has been\n    # opened or punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment is 12 hours.\n    bud_in_hours = 12\n    \n    print(\"Based on United States Pharmacopeia (USP) <797> guidelines for sterile compounding:\")\n    print(\"A single-dose container (such as an ampule or vial) that is punctured or opened in a sterile, ISO Class 5 environment must be used within the following timeframe.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer Equation:\")\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is {bud_in_hours} hours after the time of initial puncture or opening.\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: An ampule cannot be resealed after opening.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
