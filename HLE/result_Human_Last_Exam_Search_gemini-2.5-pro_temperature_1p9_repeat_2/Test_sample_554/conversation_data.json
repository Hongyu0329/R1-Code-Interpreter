    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms. This is based on a specific, flexible nanocar molecule with the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" or \"perfluorinated\" in chemistry signifies that all hydrogen atoms in a compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar, one must first know the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar structure.\n\nNanocars are a class of molecules and their exact chemical structure can vary. However, a flexible nanocar designed and computationally studied has a molecular formula of C₃₁₀H₃₄. In a perfluorinated version of this specific nanocar, each of the 34 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with a fluorine atom. This results in a total of 34 fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar.\n\nOther nanocar structures exist with different numbers of hydrogen atoms. For instance, a \"Nanotruck\" has been described with the formula C₂₈₂H₁₈N₄, which would result in 18 fluorine atoms if perfluorinated. Another reported nanocar has the formula C₄₃₀H₂₇₄O, which would hypothetically contain 274 fluorine atoms upon perfluorination. The number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar is therefore entirely dependent on the specific molecular structure of the nanocar in question.\n\n<<<34>>>"
