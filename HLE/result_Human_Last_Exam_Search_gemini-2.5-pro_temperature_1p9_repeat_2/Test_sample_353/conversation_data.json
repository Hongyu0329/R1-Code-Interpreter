    "## The Exact A($\\alpha$) Stability Angle of the BDF4 Method\n\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the fourth-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF4) numerical scheme is given by:\n\n$ \\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sqrt{33}}{3}-3}\\right) $\n\nThis angle represents the largest wedge in the complex plane, symmetric with respect to the negative real axis, that is contained within the absolute stability region of the BDF4 method.\n\n### Derivation and Context\n\nThe stability of linear multistep methods, such as the BDF family, is a crucial concept in the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations. While the BDF1 and BDF2 methods are A-stable, meaning their stability region encompasses the entire left-half of the complex plane, methods of order three and higher do not possess this property. Instead, they are A($\\alpha$)-stable.\n\nA numerical method is defined as A($\\alpha$)-stable if its region of absolute stability includes the angular sector $S_\\alpha = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |\\arg(-z)| < \\alpha, z \\neq 0 \\}$ for an angle $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$. For the BDF4 method, the numerically approximated value of this angle is approximately 73.35Â°.\n\nThe exact analytical expression for this angle was determined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis. In their work, they derived the precise values for the maximum angles of A($\\vartheta$)-stability for BDF methods of order 3 through 6. For the BDF4 method, the maximum angle, denoted as $\\vartheta_4$ (which is the $\\alpha$ in this context), is defined by the relation:\n$\\tan^2(\\vartheta_4) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{33}}{3} - 3$\n\nFrom this, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians can be expressed in terms of the arctangent function as stated above. The work by Gander and Wanner later confirmed and simplified the derivation of these exact values using the computer algebra system Maple.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sqrt{33}}{3}-3}\\right)$>>>"
