    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The upper bound is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to establish this bound:\n\n1.  **Properties of the dense open subset U:**\n    The set $U$ is a dense open subset of the connected metric space $X$. The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (we assume the prompt's $\\mathbb{R}$ refers to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n \\ge 1$, which doesn't change the argument) means that $U$ is a topological n-manifold. Since $U$ is a subset of a metric space, it is itself a metric space.\n\n2.  **Separability of the components of U:**\n    Let $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ be the set of connected components of the manifold $U$. Each component $U_i$ is a connected n-manifold. A fundamental theorem in topology states that any connected manifold is separable. A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset. This is equivalent to being second-countable for a manifold.\n\n3.  **The number of components of U is countable:**\n    The connected components $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ are disjoint and are open subsets of $U$. Since $U$ is open in $X$, each $U_i$ is also an open subset of $X$. Thus, we have a collection of disjoint open sets $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ in the metric space $X$.\n\n    We can argue that the index set $I$ must be countable. A key property of a connected space is that it cannot be partitioned by a collection of disjoint open sets in the way required for $I$ to be uncountable, especially given that their union $U$ is dense. A more direct line of reasoning proves that a connected metric space must be separable. If a metric space is not separable, it contains an uncountable subset of points that are all separated by a minimum distance, which can be used to create an uncountable collection of disjoint open balls. The fact that $X$ is connected and has a dense manifold subset prevents this. It forces the space $X$ to be separable.\n\n    A separable space has the \"countable chain condition\" (ccc), which means that any collection of disjoint open sets must be countable. So, if we can show $X$ is separable, it follows that $I$ must be countable.\n\n4.  **$X$ is a separable space:**\n    We can show that $X$ must be separable. Suppose $X$ is not separable. Then there exists an uncountable collection of disjoint open balls in $X$. The intersection of these balls with the dense set $U$ would form an uncountable collection of disjoint open sets in $U$. This would imply that $U$ itself is not separable.\n\n    However, the connectedness of $X$ is the crucial property that prevents this scenario. A connected space cannot be the disjoint union of uncountably many non-empty open sets whose union is dense. This forces the number of components of $U$ to be countable.\n\n    Since the number of components $|I|$ is countable, and each component $U_i$ is separable, their union $U = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} U_i$ is also separable. A countable union of separable spaces is separable.\n\n5.  **From the separability of U to the separability of X:**\n    Let $D_U$ be a countable dense subset of $U$. Since $U$ is dense in $X$, $D_U$ is also dense in $X$. Therefore, $X$ is a separable metric space.\n\n6.  **Cardinality of separable metric spaces:**\n    There is a standard theorem stating that any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$, which is the cardinality of the real numbers (the continuum). This can be shown by constructing an injection from the space into the set of real-valued functions on its countable dense subset.\n\nTherefore, the space $X$ must have a cardinality no greater than that of the continuum.\n\nThis upper bound can be achieved. For example, if $X = \\mathbb{R}^n$, then $X$ is a connected metric space. We can take $U = X$. $U$ is a dense open subset where every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The cardinality of $X$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Another example is the closed n-dimensional ball, with the open ball as its dense subset $U$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of $X$ is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
