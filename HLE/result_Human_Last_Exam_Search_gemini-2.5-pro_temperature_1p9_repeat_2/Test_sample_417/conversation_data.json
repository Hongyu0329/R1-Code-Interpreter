    "The structure of the molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons, considering the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring which is symmetrically substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. This gives the molecule a C3 axis of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituent groups are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of unique proton signals in the central core and one of the substituent arms.\n\n2.  **Proton Signals from the Central Core**:\n    *   **Trimethylbenzene Methyls**: The three methyl groups attached to the benzene ring at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal. (**1 peak**)\n    *   **Methylene Linkers (-CH2-)**: The three methylene groups that connect the benzene ring to the indazole substituents are also equivalent due to C3 symmetry. However, each methylene group is bonded to a chiral indazole substituent. This chiral environment makes the two protons of each methylene group diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, these protons will give rise to two separate signals, likely appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). (**2 peaks**)\n\n3.  **Proton Signals from one Indazole Substituent Arm**: The substituent is (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole. This is a rigid, chiral structure derived from camphor.\n    *   **Indazole C3-Proton**: There is a single proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole system. This proton is in a unique electronic environment and has no adjacent protons to couple with, so it will appear as a singlet. (**1 peak**)\n    *   **Trimethyl Groups**: There are three methyl groups on the camphor-derived framework. One is at position C7, and two are at position C8. Due to the rigid and asymmetric (chiral) nature of the molecule, all three methyl groups are in chemically distinct environments and are non-equivalent. This results in three separate singlets. (**3 peaks**)\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton**: The proton at the C4 bridgehead is in a unique position and will give a single, distinct signal. (**1 peak**)\n    *   **Tetrahydro Protons**: The protons on carbons C5 and C6 form part of the saturated, bicyclic camphor framework. The rigidity of this system means that the two protons on C5 are diastereotopic (exo and endo) and thus non-equivalent. The same applies to the two protons on C6. Therefore, these four protons will produce four distinct signals. (**4 peaks**)\n\n4.  **Total Peak Count**:\n    *   Signals from the central core: 1 (core -CH3) + 2 (linker -CH2-) = 3 peaks\n    *   Signals from one substituent arm: 1 (indazole C3-H) + 3 (methyls) + 1 (C4-H) + 4 (C5 & C6 protons) = 9 peaks\n\nThe total number of expected peaks is the sum of the signals from the core and one arm: 3 + 9 = 12 peaks.\n\n<<<H>>>"
