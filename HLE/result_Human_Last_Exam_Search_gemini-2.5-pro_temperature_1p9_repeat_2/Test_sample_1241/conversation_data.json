    "To find the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their derivatives with respect to time are zero. Let $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nThe given system of differential equations becomes a system of linear equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4)P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$ (This is the normalization condition, as the sum of all probabilities must be 1).\n\nWe can solve this system.\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) P_2$\n$0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2$\n$P_1 = P_2$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3$\n$P_2 = P_3$\n\nCombining these results, we get $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1$\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions for $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) P_1 = 1$\n\nTo simplify the expression in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}) P_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{0.707}{0.019} P_1 = 1$\n$P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow we can calculate $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe desired value is $P_0 + P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get 0.946.\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
