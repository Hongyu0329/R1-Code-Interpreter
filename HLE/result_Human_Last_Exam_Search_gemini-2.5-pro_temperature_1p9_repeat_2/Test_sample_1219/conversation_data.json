    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must first understand the properties of the tangent function. The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means that for any real number x and any integer k, tan(x) = tan(x + kπ). Consequently, to find tan(10^100), we can find the value of 10^100 modulo π.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\ntan(10^100) = tan(10^100 mod π)\n\nThe value of 10^100 mod π is `10^100 - k * π`, where `k = floor(10^100 / π)`. This is equivalent to `π` multiplied by the fractional part of the division of `10^100` by `π`.\n\nLet's analyze the term `10^100 / π`. We can rewrite it as `10^100 * (1/π)`. To find the fractional part of this number, we need a high-precision value of 1/π.\n\nThe decimal expansion of 1/π begins as:\n0.3183098861837906715377675267450287240689192914809128974953349769995960292211204481017918543454911033...\n\nWhen we multiply 1/π by 10^100, we effectively shift the decimal point 100 places to the right. The integer part of `10^100 / π` is the sequence of the first 100 digits of 1/π after the decimal point, and the fractional part is formed by the digits from the 101st place onwards.\n\nLooking at the digits of 1/π, the first 100 digits are:\n3183098861837906715377675267450287240689192914809128974953349769995960292211204481017918543454911033\n\nTo continue, we need the digits that follow. Using a source for a higher precision of 1/π, the sequence continues with: ...11033**82795**...\n\nThus, the digits of 1/π from the 101st place are 8, 2, 7, 9, 5, and so on. This means the fractional part of `10^100 / π` is approximately 0.82795.\n\nNow, we calculate the argument for the tangent function:\nArgument = π * {10^100 / π} ≈ 3.14159 * 0.82795 ≈ 2.60094\n\nThe final step is to calculate the tangent of this value:\ntan(2.60094) ≈ -0.635\n\nThe first three digits after the comma are 635.\n\n<<<635>>>"
