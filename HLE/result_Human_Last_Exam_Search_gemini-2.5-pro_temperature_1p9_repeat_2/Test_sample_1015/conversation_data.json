    "The fundamental distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. While both techniques involve a backbend, their approach to the torso and hip alignment differs significantly.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a squared and symmetrical torso. During a cambré derrière, the back arches from the upper and middle spine, while the hips are meant to remain as square as possible, preventing one hip from lifting higher than the other. The focus is on the flexibility of the spine to create a pure and controlled backbend.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is recognized for a more dynamic and less rigid torso, famously incorporating an \"open hip\". This style often features swaying hips and a more athletic execution of movements. In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer might allow the hip of the working leg to lift, breaking the traditional \"box\" alignment of the shoulders and hips to achieve a more expansive and dramatic line. This hip placement is a defining characteristic of the Balanchine aesthetic.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement, head position, speed, and the degree of the backbend are also components of the style of each method, the most significant and foundational difference in executing a cambré derrière is the hip placement. The Vaganova method prioritizes a stable, square hip alignment, whereas the Balanchine method often utilizes an open and more liberated hip position.\n\n<<<B>>>"
