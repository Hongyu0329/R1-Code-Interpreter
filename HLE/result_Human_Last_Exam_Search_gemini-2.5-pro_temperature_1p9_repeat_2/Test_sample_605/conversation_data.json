    "A recent paper has calculated the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau link defined by the family with weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75). The paper, \"Machine learning Sasakian and G2 topology on contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds\", lists the invariant for a large number of such manifolds.\n\nThe user's query specifies a polynomial which contains a typographical error in the monomial `z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3`. In the context of weighted projective space, all monomials of a defining polynomial must have the same weighted degree. For the given weights, the term `z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3` has a weighted degree of 224, while all other terms correctly have a weighted degree of 225.\n\nThe reference paper provides a valid polynomial from this family:\n`0 = z_1^8*z_3 + z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3 + z_1*z_2^7 + z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5 + z_2*z_3^4 + z_4^3*z_5 + z_5^3`\n\nDespite the apparent typographical error in the paper's listed polynomial (which seems to replicate the same error as the query, suggesting a common incorrect source), it also provides the calculated Crawley-Nordström (CN) invariant for this specific weight system. The calculation of such invariants is complex and typically depends on the global properties of the manifold determined by the weights, rather than the specific coefficients of the defining polynomial, provided the polynomial is generic.\n\nFor the Calabi-Yau link represented by a generic polynomial in the ambient space `P(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`, the Crawley-Nordström invariant is 35.\n\n<<<35>>>"
