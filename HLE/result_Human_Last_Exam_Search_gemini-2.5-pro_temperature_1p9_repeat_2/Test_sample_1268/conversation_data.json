    "The problem asks for an upper bound on the maximum norm, denoted as $(k_{k,\\infty})$, in relation to the covolume $(V)$ for lattices associated with squarefree natural numbers $(N)$. This question lies at the intersection of algebraic number theory and the geometry of numbers.\n\n### 1. The Mathematical Context: Lattices from Quadratic Fields\n\nThe setting for this problem is the study of lattices derived from quadratic number fields. Let $N$ be a squarefree integer. We consider the quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$. The ring of integers of this field, denoted by $O_K$, forms a lattice when embedded into a real vector space.\n\nThe structure of $O_K$ and its discriminant, $\\Delta_K$, depend on $N$ modulo 4:\n*   If $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $O_K = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}\\right]$ and the discriminant is $\\Delta_K = N$.\n*   If $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $O_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{N}]$ and the discriminant is $\\Delta_K = 4N$.\n\nThe standard embedding of the quadratic field $K$ into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ maps an element $a + b\\sqrt{N} \\in K$ to $(a+b\\sqrt{N}, a-b\\sqrt{N})$ if $N > 0$ (a real quadratic field), or to $(\\text{Re}(a+b\\sqrt{N}), \\text{Im}(a+b\\sqrt{N}))$ if $N<0$ (an imaginary quadratic field).\n\n### 2. Covolume of the Lattice\n\nThe covolume $V$ of the lattice formed by the image of $O_K$ under this embedding is directly related to the discriminant of the number field. The covolume is given by:\n$V = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$\nTherefore:\n*   If $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $V = \\sqrt{N}$.\n*   If $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, $V = \\sqrt{4N} = 2\\sqrt{N}$.\n\n### 3. Maximum Norm and Minkowski's Theorem\n\nThe term \"maximum norm\" $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in the context of lattices typically refers to the length of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice, measured with respect to the $L_\\infty$ (or maximum) norm. For a vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, this norm is $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_\\infty = \\max(|x_1|, |x_2|)$. Let's denote this quantity by $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda)$.\n\nTo find an upper bound for $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda)$, we can apply Minkowski's Theorem on convex bodies. This fundamental result in the geometry of numbers states that if $S$ is a centrally symmetric convex body in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\Lambda$ is a lattice of covolume $V$, and if the volume of $S$ is greater than $2^n V$, then $S$ must contain a non-zero lattice point.\n\nIn our case, $n=2$. We choose a convex set $S$ that is defined by the $L_\\infty$ norm. A ball in the $L_\\infty$ norm is a square. Let us consider a square $S_t$ centered at the origin with side length $2t$:\n$S_t = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_\\infty \\leq t\\} = [-t, t] \\times [-t, t]$\nThe volume (area) of this square is $(2t)^2 = 4t^2$.\n\nAccording to Minkowski's Theorem, if $\\text{vol}(S_t) > 2^2 V$, then $S_t$ contains a non-zero lattice point $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\Lambda$. This means there exists a non-zero vector $\\mathbf{v}$ such that $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_\\infty \\leq t$. The length of the shortest non-zero vector, $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda)$, is the smallest $t$ for which such a vector is guaranteed to exist.\n\nWe set the volume of the square equal to the bound $4V$:\n$4t^2 = 4V \\implies t^2 = V \\implies t = \\sqrt{V}$\n\nTherefore, Minkowski's theorem guarantees the existence of a non-zero lattice vector $\\mathbf{v}$ with $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_\\infty \\leq \\sqrt{V}$. This provides an upper bound for the $L_\\infty$-norm of the shortest vector:\n$\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda) \\leq \\sqrt{V}$\n\n### 4. Final Result\n\nRelating this back to the notation in the question, we identify $k_{k,\\infty}$ with $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda)$. The upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ is thus given by the square root of the covolume.\n\nThe upper bound can be expressed in terms of the squarefree number $N$:\n*   For $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, we have $V = \\sqrt{N}$, so $k_{k,\\infty} \\leq (N)^{1/4}$.\n*   For $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, we have $V = 2\\sqrt{N}$, so $k_{k,\\infty} \\leq \\sqrt{2\\sqrt{N}} = \\sqrt{2} N^{1/4}$.\n\nIn summary, the general relationship is an upper bound of $\\sqrt{V}$.\n\n\\\n\\\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is $\\sqrt{V}$.>>>"
