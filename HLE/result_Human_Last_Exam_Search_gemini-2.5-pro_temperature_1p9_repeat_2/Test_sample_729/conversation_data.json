    "In the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, there are a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 can be described by the presentation:\nQ_128 = <a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹>\n\nA power subgroup G^m is the subgroup generated by the m-th powers of all elements in the group G. The elements of Q_128 are of the form aⁱ and aⁱx, for i = 0, 1, ..., 63. To find the number of distinct power subgroups, we analyze the subgroups generated for different values of m.\n\n1.  **For any odd integer m**: The subgroup G^m is the entire group Q_128 itself.\n\n2.  **For even integers m**: The power subgroup G^m is a cyclic subgroup of the form <a^d>, where d is the greatest common divisor of m and 64 (d = gcd(m, 64)). Since the order of the group is 128 (a 2-power), the possible values for d are the powers of 2 that can divide 64.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are:\n*   **Q_128**: The entire group, which is a power subgroup for any odd m (e.g., m=1).\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 32**: This is generated by a² and corresponds to any even m where gcd(m, 64) = 2 (e.g., m=2).\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 16**: This is generated by a⁴ and corresponds to any m where gcd(m, 64) = 4 (e.g., m=4).\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 8**: This is generated by a⁸ and corresponds to any m where gcd(m, 64) = 8 (e.g., m=8).\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 4**: This is generated by a¹⁶ and corresponds to any m where gcd(m, 64) = 16 (e.g., m=16).\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 2**: This is generated by a³² and corresponds to any m where gcd(m, 64) = 32 (e.g., m=32).\n*   **The trivial subgroup {1}**: This is generated by a⁶⁴ and corresponds to any m that is a multiple of 64 (e.g., m=64).\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we have 1 non-cyclic subgroup (Q_128 itself) and 6 cyclic subgroups (including the trivial one).\n\nTherefore, there are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
