    "For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with n replicas is parametrized by a target space whose structure is derived from the supermanifold SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). To find the number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables, we must determine the dimension of the bosonic part of this coset space.\n\nThe bosonic submanifold of the supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) is the product of the symplectic group Sp(2n, R) and the special orthogonal group SO(2n). The bosonic subgroup of the denominator, the unitary supergroup U(n|n), is U(n) x U(n). Therefore, the bosonic part of the target space is the coset manifold (Sp(2n, R) x SO(2n)) / (U(n) x U(n)).\n\nThe number of non-Grassmann variables is the dimension of this manifold. The dimensions of the respective Lie groups are:\n*   dim(Sp(2n, R)) = n(2n+1)\n*   dim(SO(2n)) = n(2n-1)\n*   dim(U(n)) = n²\n\nThe total dimension of the bosonic manifold is given by:\n\ndim((Sp(2n, R) x SO(2n)) / (U(n) x U(n))) = dim(Sp(2n, R)) + dim(SO(2n)) - dim(U(n)) - dim(U(n))\n= n(2n+1) + n(2n-1) - n² - n²\n= (2n² + n) + (2n² - n) - 2n²\n= 2n²\n\nFor the case of two replicas, we set n = 2:\n\nNumber of variables = 2 * (2)² = 2 * 4 = 8.\n\nThus, 8 non-Grassmann variables are needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D.\n\n<<<8>>>"
