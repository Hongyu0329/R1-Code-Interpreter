The general formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:

**Z = ∫<sub>APBC</sub> D[ψ̄]D[ψ] e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]</sup>**

Where:

*   **∫<sub>APBC</sub> ...** signifies that the integration is over all field histories that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions (APBC) in the imaginary time direction:
    **ψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ)**
    **ψ̄(x, τ + β) = -ψ̄(x, τ)**

*   **D[ψ̄]D[ψ]** represents the functional integration measure over all possible configurations of the Grassmann-valued fermion fields ψ̄ and ψ.

*   **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the system. It is obtained from the standard (Minkowskian) action by performing a Wick rotation. The Euclidean action is an integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density (L<sub>E</sub>) over imaginary time from 0 to β and over all spatial dimensions.
    **S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x L<sub>E</sub>(ψ̄, ∂<sub>τ</sub>ψ, ψ, ∇ψ)**

For example, the Euclidean action for a free Dirac fermion field in (3+1) dimensions is:

**S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>3</sup>x ψ̄(x, τ) (γ<sup>0</sup>∂<sub>τ</sub> + γ<sup>i</sup>∂<sub>i</sub> + m) ψ(x, τ)**

The integration over the anti-commuting fields in this Gaussian integral can be formally carried out, yielding the determinant of the operator in the action:

**Z = det(γ<sup>μ</sup>∂<sub>μ</sub> + m)** (with the appropriate anti-periodic boundary conditions implied for the operator).
