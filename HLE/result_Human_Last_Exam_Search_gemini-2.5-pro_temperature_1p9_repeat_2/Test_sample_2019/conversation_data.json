    "I am unable to provide a definitive numerical answer to the question of how many ways you can place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nWhile extensive research has been conducted on the n-queens problem on a toroidal board, a specific enumeration for placing a number of queens less than the board size (k<n) is not readily available in the searched resources.\n\nKey findings from the investigation include:\n\n*   The problem of placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is well-understood. A solution exists if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This confirms that it is possible to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 board.\n*   The question of placing *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* board where *k* < *n* is a variant of the classic problem.\n*   Renowned chess problem expert Václav Kotěšovec has published extensively on non-attacking chess piece configurations, and his work likely contains the answer. However, the specific number of arrangements for 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is not found in the available search results.\n*   The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) was queried, but no sequence corresponding to the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board was found within the search results.\n\nWithout access to specialized publications in combinatorics or computational results, the precise number of ways remains elusive.\n\n<<<I was unable to find the answer to the question.>>>"
