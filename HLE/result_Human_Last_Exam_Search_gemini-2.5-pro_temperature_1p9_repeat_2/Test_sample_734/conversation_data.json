    "**Francis Turretin, a 17th-century Swiss-Italian Reformed scholastic theologian, was the first to develop and apply specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature in a way that is applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall.**\n\nTurretin employed the scholastic distinction between God's \"ordained power\" (*potentia Dei ordinata*) and God's \"absolute power\" (*potentia Dei absoluta*) to explain events that seemingly contradict the established laws of nature.\n\n*   ***Potentia Dei ordinata*** refers to God's power as it is expressed through the consistent and regular workings of the natural world He created and ordained. This is the realm of natural laws as we observe them.\n*   ***Potentia Dei absoluta*** refers to God's absolute power to do anything that is not logically contradictory, including actions outside of the established natural order.\n\nIn his seminal work, *Institutes of Elenctic Theology*, Turretin utilized this framework to address complex theological issues. He argued that from the perspective of philosophy and natural law (*potentia ordinata*), a virgin birth is impossible. However, from the perspective of theology, it is entirely possible through God's supernatural power (*potentia absoluta*). A direct quote illustrates this distinction: \"In philosophy, they are denied with reference to the laws of nature, but in theology they are affirmed with reference to divine omnipotence and supernaturally.\"\n\nTurretin also applied a related framework to the consequences of the Fall. He wrote extensively on the \"covenant of nature,\" the state of humanity and the natural world before the Fall, which operated under a specific ordinance from God. After the Fall, this natural state became \"highly disordered.\" Turretin explained that man's natural theology, which was \"exquisite in Adam before his fall,\" became corrupted. This implies a change in the workings of nature and humanity's relationship with it, moving from a state of integrity to one of corruption. These changes can be understood as a shift in God's ordained operations in the world as a consequence of sin, a realm where God's absolute power and justice are revealed in ways that alter the previous natural order. His distinctions between the \"natural\" and \"supernatural\" order, and his application of God's absolute and ordained power, provide a cohesive terminology to discuss both the unique miracle of the virgin birth and the systemic changes to the natural world resulting from the Fall.\n\nWhile earlier theologians like Augustine and Aquinas discussed miracles and nature, and the distinction of God's powers was a part of medieval scholasticism, Turretin is notable for his systematic application of this specific terminology to create a coherent framework that addresses both the virgin birth and the altered state of nature after the Fall.\n\n<<<Francis Turretin>>>"
