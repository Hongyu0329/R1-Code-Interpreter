    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a total of two isomers are formed.\n\nThe starting complex, *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) or `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, is an octahedral metal complex. Due to the arrangement of the two bidentate bipyridine (bpy) ligands and the two chloride ligands in a *cis* configuration, the complex is chiral. This means it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, known as enantiomers. These enantiomers are designated as the delta (Δ) and lambda (Λ) isomers. Therefore, the starting reactant is a racemic mixture of Δ-*cis*-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2] and Λ-*cis*-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2].\n\nIn the reaction, the bidentate ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole substitutes the two chloride ligands to form the product complex, `[Ru(bpy)2(2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)]2+`. This substitution reaction generally proceeds with retention of the original stereochemistry at the ruthenium center.\n\nConsequently, the reaction yields a racemic mixture of the product:\n*   The Δ isomer of the starting complex forms the Δ isomer of the product.\n*   The Λ isomer of the starting complex forms the Λ isomer of the product.\n\nThese two resulting product molecules (Δ and Λ) are enantiomers of each other. As enantiomers are a type of stereoisomer, two distinct isomers are formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<2>>>"
