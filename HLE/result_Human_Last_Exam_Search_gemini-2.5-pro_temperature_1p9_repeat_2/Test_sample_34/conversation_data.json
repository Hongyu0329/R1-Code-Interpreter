    "An analysis of GTO (Game Theory Optimal) pre-flop opening ranges for a 100 big blind, 6-max, rake-free cash game indicates that a very wide range of hands should be opened from the button. In a rake-free environment, the incentive to steal the blinds is at its highest, leading to wider opening ranges compared to games with rake.\n\nSeveral sources confirm that button opening ranges in such scenarios are extensive. For instance, in a similar rake-free (ChipEV) tournament setting with a 40BB stack, the button opens 51% of hands. In a standard 100bb cash game, some charts for raked environments suggest opening hands as weak as J4s or J5s from the button. A GTO Wizard article mentions that in a raked game, even very weak hands like J4s are sometimes opened, and importantly, notes that in an unraked game, the button's opening range is even wider. GTO-specialized sites like GTOBase and GTO Charts offer specific solutions for 100bb, no-rake, 6-max games, further supporting the existence of established wide-range opening strategies for this format.\n\nConsidering the positional advantage and the absence of rake, a GTO approach for a 2.5x open from the button includes all suited Jack combinations to maximize the opportunities to win the pot pre-flop or play in a highly advantageous position post-flop. Therefore, the weakest, or \"worst,\" suited Jack that is considered a standard open is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
