    "Based on my research and understanding of the concepts in algebraic topology, particularly those related to homotopy theory, loop spaces, and suspension, it is not possible to provide a definitive numerical answer to the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ without access to specialized literature or advanced computational techniques.\n\nThe problem requires a detailed analysis of the following:\n1.  **The precise definition of the map:** The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" is crucial but does not uniquely specify the map in a way that is easily searchable. There are several canonical maps in homotopy theory that could fit this description, such as variations of the James-Hopf invariant or Samelson product.\n2.  **The homotopy groups of the spaces involved:** The domain is the suspension of the smash product of the loop spaces of $S^4$ and $S^6$, i.e., $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. The codomain is the loop space of the smash product of the spheres, $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, which is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   The connectivity of the domain is 8. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   The connectivity of the codomain is also 8. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  **The induced map on homotopy groups:** The connectivity of the map is determined by the highest integer `n` for which the map induces an isomorphism on $\\pi_k$ for `k < n` and a surjection on $\\pi_n$. Since both spaces are 8-connected, the map is at least 8-connected. The connectivity then depends on the induced map on $\\pi_9$, $\\pi_{10}$, and so on.\n\nCalculating the relevant homotopy groups and the induced map often requires sophisticated tools like the EHP spectral sequence or other computational methods in algebraic topology, the results of which are not readily available in general web search results. While there are formulas for the connectivity of related maps, they seem to vary and depend on the specific construction.\n\nWithout a precise definition of the map and access to tables of homotopy groups or relevant established theorems from advanced texts, any numerical answer would be speculative.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
