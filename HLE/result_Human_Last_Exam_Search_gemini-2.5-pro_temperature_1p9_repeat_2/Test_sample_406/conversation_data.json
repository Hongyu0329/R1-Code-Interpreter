    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThis concept is a generalization of a tripled fixed point and an extension of an FG-coupled fixed point. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n1.  **Setting:** The spaces (X, dₓ), (Y, dᵧ), and (Z, d₂) are partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. This means that the functions are non-decreasing in some arguments and non-increasing in others. For F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, this property is defined as follows:\n    *   **F** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n    *   **G** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n    *   **H** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n\n    For example, for a mapping `F: X × X × X → X`, the mixed monotone property means that for any x, y, z in X:\n    *   If x₁ ≤ x₂, then F(x₁, y, z) ≤ F(x₂, y, z).\n    *   If y₁ ≤ y₂, then F(x, y₁, z) ≥ F(x, y₂, z).\n    *   If z₁ ≤ z₂, then F(x, y₁, z) ≤ F(x, y₂, z).\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive-type condition. This condition ensures that when the functions are applied iteratively, the distances between successive points decrease, leading to a convergent sequence. An example of such a condition on the product space X × Y × Z with a specific metric would involve inequalities that bound the distance between the outputs of F, G, and H based on the distances of their inputs, multiplied by a contraction constant less than 1.\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z that satisfies certain relations with the outputs of F, G, and H. For instance, a common requirement is the existence of (x₀, y₀, z₀) such that:\n    *   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    *   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n    *   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n5.  **Continuity or Regularity:** In some theorems, the functions F, G, and H are required to be continuous. However, this condition can sometimes be relaxed if the space has certain regularity properties, such as if non-decreasing sequences that converge have their limit as an upper bound.\n\nUnder these general conditions, the iterative sequences defined by xₙ₊₁ = F(xₙ, yₙ, zₙ), yₙ₊₁ = G(yₙ, xₙ, yₙ), and zₙ₊₁ = H(zₙ, yₙ, xₙ) will converge to a point (x*, y*, z*), which will be an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\nFor the **uniqueness** of the FGH-tripled fixed point, an additional condition is typically required. This condition usually states that for any two points in the product space, there exists a third point that is comparable to both.\n\nIt is important to note that the precise formulation of the contractive conditions and the mixed monotone property can vary in different works, leading to various theorems with slightly different requirements. The concept is an active area of research in fixed point theory, with extensions to different types of spaces and more general contractive conditions being explored."
