    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a method to convert aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. In this process, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is exchanged for the carbon group of the phosphonium ylide, creating a new carbon-carbon double bond. The byproduct of this reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Pivalaldehyde** (systematic name: 2,2-dimethylpropanal) has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   The **Wittig reagent** is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane. This is an ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-C₆H₄Cl), where \"Ph\" is a phenyl group and \"o-C₆H₄Cl\" is a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n\n**Reaction:**\nThe nucleophilic carbon of the ylide attacks the carbonyl carbon of the pivalaldehyde. This leads to the formation of a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to form the final products.\n\nThe `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` portion of pivalaldehyde combines with the `=CH-CH₂-(o-C₆H₄Cl)` portion of the ylide. This results in the alkene product: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-C₆H₄Cl).\n\n**Product Name:**\nThe correct IUPAC name for the resulting alkene is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Stereochemistry:**\nThe stereochemistry of the double bond (E/Z isomerism) in a Wittig reaction depends on the nature of the ylide.\n*   **Stabilized ylides** (with electron-withdrawing groups) tend to produce the more thermodynamically stable *E*-alkene.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides** (with alkyl or aryl groups) typically favor the formation of the *Z*-alkene under kinetic control, especially under lithium-salt-free conditions.\n\nThe ylide in this reaction, with a (2-chlorophenyl)ethyl group, is considered non-stabilized or semi-stabilized. However, pivalaldehyde is a sterically hindered aldehyde. The steric bulk of both the aldehyde and the ylide can influence the stereochemical outcome, often leading to a mixture of *E* and *Z* isomers, sometimes favoring the *E*-isomer to minimize steric repulsion in the transition state. Without specific reaction conditions, a mixture of both isomers would be expected.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
