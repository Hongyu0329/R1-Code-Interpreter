    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we will analyze the structure of its branch points.\n\n### 1. Identify the Curve and its Genus\nThe curve is given by the equation $y^2 = P(x)$, where $P(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nSince the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$ is 5, the curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n\n### 2. Determine the Branch Points\nThe branch points of the hyperelliptic map are the roots of the polynomial $P(x)$ and the point at infinity (since the degree is odd).\nWe can factor $P(x)$ as $x \\cdot Q(x)$, where $Q(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nSo, one branch point is at $x_0 = 0$. The other four are the roots of $Q(x)$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the 2-adic Valuations of the Roots\nTo understand the stable reduction, we need to find the 2-adic valuations ($v_2$) of the roots of $Q(x)$. We use the Newton polygon method for $Q(x)$ with respect to the prime 2.\nThe coefficients of $Q(x)$ are $c_4=8, c_3=4, c_2=4, c_1=1, c_0=8$.\nTheir 2-adic valuations are $v_2(c_4)=3, v_2(c_3)=2, v_2(c_2)=2, v_2(c_1)=0, v_2(c_0)=3$.\nWe plot the points $(i, v_2(c_i))$ for $i=0, ..., 4$:\n$(0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 3)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points has the following segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0, 3)$ to $(1, 0)$. The slope is $(0-3)/(1-0) = -3$. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $r_1$, with valuation $v_2(r_1) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  A segment from $(1, 0)$ to $(4, 3)$. The slope is $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. This segment's projection on the x-axis has length $4-1=3$. It corresponds to three roots, $r_2, r_3, r_4$, each with valuation $v_2(r_i) = -(1) = -1$.\n\nSo, the valuations of the roots of $P(x)$ are for $\\{0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$: $\\{\\infty, 3, -1, -1, -1\\}$. The sixth branch point is at $x=\\infty$.\n\n### 4. Cluster the Branch Points\nThe stable reduction is determined by how the branch points cluster together in the 2-adic sense.\n*   The three roots $r_2, r_3, r_4$ have the same valuation $v_2=-1$. A deeper analysis shows they are conjugate over the field of 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ and form a single cluster. Let's call this cluster $C_1 = \\{r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$.\n*   The other branch points, $0$, $\\infty$, and the root $r_1$ with $v_2(r_1)=3$, are \"far\" from this cluster and from each other. They form their own individual clusters.\n\n### 5. Determine the Structure of the Stable Reduction\nThe general theory of stable reduction states that the special fiber of the stable model is composed of components corresponding to these clusters of branch points.\n*   The cluster $C_1$ corresponds to a component which is the stable model of the curve $y^2 = (x-r_2)(x-r_3)(x-r_4)$. This is a curve of genus $\\lfloor(3-1)/2\\rfloor = 1$, i.e., an elliptic curve. Let's assume it reduces to a single component $C_E$ of genus 1.\n*   The remaining, isolated branch points ($0, \\infty, r_1$) lie on a rational component, $C_R$ (genus 0).\n\nTherefore, the special fiber of the stable reduction consists of two components ($N=2$): one elliptic curve ($C_E$) and one rational curve ($C_R$).\n\n### 6. Calculate the Number of Double Points\nThe arithmetic genus of the special fiber, $p_a$, must equal the genus of the original curve, $g=2$. For a stable curve composed of components connected in a tree-like structure, the genus is given by the formula:\n$p_a = \\sum g_i + \\delta - N + 1$\nwhere:\n*   $g_i$ are the genera of the components.\n*   $\\delta$ is the number of double points (nodes).\n*   $N$ is the number of components.\n\nIn our case:\n*   $p_a = g = 2$.\n*   $\\sum g_i = g(C_E) + g(C_R) = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n*   $N=2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$2 = 1 + \\delta - 2 + 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\n\nThe stable reduction has 2 double points. These two nodes connect the elliptic component to the rational component.\n\n<<<2>>>"
