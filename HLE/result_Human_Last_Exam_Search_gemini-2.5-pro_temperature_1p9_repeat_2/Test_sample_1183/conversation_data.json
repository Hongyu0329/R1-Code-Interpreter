    "### Molecule Exhibits D3h Symmetry\n\nThe molecule represented by the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 possesses a **D3h** symmetry point group.\n\nThe core structure of the molecule is a derivative of hexadehydrotribenzoannulene, a large, planar aromatic system. This parent structure is known to be highly symmetric and belongs to the D3h point group. The molecule in question is formed by attaching three linear ethynyl (-C≡CH) groups to the outer benzene rings of this core.\n\nThe analysis of the molecular structure reveals the following symmetry elements, which together define the D3h point group:\n*   **One principal three-fold axis of rotation (C3):** This axis passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its plane.\n*   **Three two-fold axes of rotation (C2):** These axes lie within the plane of the molecule, each passing through the central point.\n*   **One horizontal mirror plane (σh):** This plane is coincident with the plane of the molecule itself, a consequence of its planarity.\n*   **Three vertical mirror planes (σv):** Each of these planes contains the principal C3 axis and one of the C2 axes.\n*   **Two three-fold improper rotation axes (S3):** These are also present, collinear with the principal C3 axis.\n\nThe symmetric placement of the three ethynyl substituents on the D3h-symmetric core preserves all of these symmetry elements, resulting in the molecule retaining the D3h point group. While derivatives of this core can be synthesized to have lower symmetries, such as C3, by introducing substituents that force a propeller-like twist, the ethynyl groups in this specific configuration do not induce such a distortion.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
