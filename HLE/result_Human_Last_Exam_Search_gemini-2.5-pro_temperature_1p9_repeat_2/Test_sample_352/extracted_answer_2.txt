To relieve the autoinhibition, the recommended site-directed mutagenesis experiment is to replace all four residues at positions 47, 48, 49, and 50 with Alanine. The resulting mutant sequence would be AAAA.

Here is the rationale for this recommendation:
*   **Eliminating Negative Charges**: The primary driver of the autoinhibition is the high concentration of negative charges from the Glutamate (E) and Aspartate (D) residues. Replacing E48, E49, and D50 with the neutral amino acid Alanine directly removes these charges. This type of substitution, often part of an "alanine scan," is a standard technique to probe the function of specific amino acid residues by removing the properties of their side chains.
*   **Preventing Phosphorylation**: The Serine at position 47 is a phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation adds a large, negatively charged phosphate group, which would further contribute to the autoinhibitory effect. The most common and effective way to create a "phospho-dead" mutant and prevent phosphorylation is to mutate the serine to an alanine. Alanine's methyl group side chain is chemically inert and cannot be phosphorylated, thereby removing this additional layer of negative regulation.
*   **Minimizing Structural Disruption**: Alanine is a small and non-bulky amino acid. Substituting it for the existing residues is less likely to cause major structural changes or introduce new, unwanted interactions compared to larger or charged amino acids. Since this region is an Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR), maintaining its flexibility while neutralizing its charge is key. Replacing the entire S-E-E-D patch with A-A-A-A is a robust and direct method to test the hypothesis that the negative charge and phosphorylation at this specific location are responsible for the autoinhibition. This approach has been successfully used to study the effects of phosphorylation and charge on protein function.

An alternative, more conservative approach would be to substitute the negatively charged residues with their neutral amide counterparts (Glutamate to Glutamine [Q] and Aspartate to Asparagine [N]), resulting in a sequence of A-Q-Q-N (after also mutating Serine to Alanine). This maintains a similar side chain size. However, the quadruple-alanine mutant is the most direct and unambiguous strategy to test the specific role of negative charge in this patch.
