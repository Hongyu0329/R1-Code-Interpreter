    "### In the Feynman Path Integral Formalism, the Bare Green's Function is Inversely Proportional to the Energy Offset from the Single-Particle Eigenvalue\n\nIn the framework of the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as $G_0$, exhibits a distinct functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, for a given momentum state 'k', the bare Green's function in energy-momentum space is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable (often frequency, $\\omega$) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe bare Green's function, also known as the free propagator, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. It is formally defined as the two-point correlation function in a non-interacting theory. Within the path integral formalism, this function can be derived by considering the path integral for a free particle, where the action, S, in the exponential only contains the kinetic energy term.\n\nThe general expression for a two-point Green's function in the path integral formalism is given by the functional integral over all possible field configurations $\\phi(x)$:\n\n$G(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{\\int D\\phi \\, \\phi(x_1) \\phi(x_2) e^{iS[\\phi]}}{\\int D\\phi \\, e^{iS[\\phi]}}$\n\nFor the bare Green's function, $G_0$, the action $S$ is that of a free particle. After performing the path integral in position-time space, the resulting propagator can be Fourier transformed into energy-momentum space. This transformation reveals the direct relationship with the single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\nThe single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, represent the energy of a free particle with momentum 'k'. For a non-relativistic particle, this is given by $\\epsilon_k = \\frac{\\hbar^2k^2}{2m}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, 'k' is the wavevector (momentum), and 'm' is the mass of the particle.\n\nThe explicit functional dependence of the bare Green's function on these energy eigenvalues in frequency-momentum space is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nHere, $\\omega$ is the frequency, which is equivalent to energy in units where $\\hbar=1$. The term $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal positive quantity that ensures causality by shifting the pole slightly off the real axis. This specific form, with the pole in the denominator at the single-particle energy, is a hallmark of the bare propagator. The presence of this pole signifies that the particle can propagate freely with an energy equal to its single-particle eigenvalue.\n\n<<<Inversely proportional to the difference between the energy ($\\omega$ or E) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ($\\epsilon_k$), typically expressed as $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$.>>>"
