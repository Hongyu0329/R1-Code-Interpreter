    "The initial search results confirm that the modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse \"systir\". The native Old English word for sister was \"sweostor\" or \"swuster\". The interaction between the Norse invaders and the Anglo-Saxons led to the replacement of the Old English term with the Old Norse one. To answer the user's question, I need to investigate the likely phonological development of \"sweostor\" into Modern English without the influence of Old Norse. I have enough information from the first step to proceed with this investigation in the next steps. I do not need more searches at this point.\nThe research confirms that the Old English word for \"sister\" was \"sweostor\" with various spellings like \"swuster\" and \"swester\". It also shows that the modern English word \"sister\" is influenced by the Old Norse \"systir\". The search also provided the modern German and Dutch words for \"sister\" (\"Schwester\" and \"zus\" or \"zuster\" respectively), which are cognates and show a potential path of development for the Old English word. To provide a comprehensive answer, I need to analyze the likely phonological changes that \"sweostor\" would have undergone as it evolved into Modern English without the Norse influence. This involves looking at how similar sound combinations have developed in English and its Germanic relatives. The current information is sufficient to proceed with this analysis and formulate the final answer. Therefore, no further searches are needed.\n\n\nBetween the 7th and 12th centuries, the interaction between the Anglo-Saxons and Norse invaders profoundly shaped the development of the English language. A clear example of this is the word for a female sibling.\n\nThe original Old English word for \"sister\" was **sweostor** (pronounced roughly as \"sweh-os-tor\"), with dialectal variations such as *swuster* and *swester*. This word is a direct descendant of the Proto-Germanic *swestÄ“r, sharing roots with other Germanic languages.\n\nHowever, the arrival of Norse speakers introduced their own word for sister: **systir**. Due to the close contact and linguistic similarities between Old English and Old Norse, many Norse words were adopted into English, often replacing the native term. The modern English \"sister\" with its \"i\" vowel is a direct result of this Old Norse influence, which replaced the native Old English vowel sound.\n\nHad the Norse never invaded, the Old English *sweostor* or *swuster* would have evolved naturally into Modern English. Following typical English phonological development, the Middle English form was commonly **suster**. In this form, the vowel 'u' would likely have undergone the same sound change as in words like \"cut\" or \"sun.\"\n\nTherefore, without the Norse influence, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be:\n\n<<<suster>>>"
