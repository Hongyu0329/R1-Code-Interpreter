    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Substrate and Reagent:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The stereochemistry indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are on the same side of the ring, making it a *cis* isomer. The reagent, potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), is a strong, sterically bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 elimination mechanism.\n\n2.  **E2 Reaction Requirements:** The E2 mechanism on a cyclohexane ring has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromine) and the proton being removed must be in an anti-periplanar (or trans-diaxial) position. This means one must be axial-up and the other must be axial-down.\n\n3.  **Chair Conformations:** To analyze the reaction, we must consider the chair conformations of cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane:\n    *   **Conformation A:** In one conformation, the bromine atom is in an axial position, and the methyl group is in an equatorial position. For the E2 reaction to proceed, the bromine must be axial.\n    *   **Conformation B:** After a ring flip, the bromine atom would be in an equatorial position, and the methyl group would be axial. E2 elimination cannot occur from this conformation because an equatorial leaving group is not anti-periplanar to any beta-hydrogens.\n\n4.  **Identifying Possible Products:** The reaction must proceed through Conformation A (axial bromine). In this conformation, we look for beta-hydrogens (hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbon with the bromine) that are in an axial position. The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At Carbon 2 (C2):** There is a hydrogen atom that is axial and therefore anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Removing this hydrogen would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**.\n    *   **At Carbon 6 (C6):** There is also a hydrogen atom that is axial and anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Removing this hydrogen would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n5.  **Determining the Major Product (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev):** Since two E2 products are possible, we must determine which is the major product.\n    *   **Zaitsev's Rule:** This rule predicts that the more substituted (and generally more stable) alkene will be the major product. 1-methylcyclohexene is a trisubstituted alkene.\n    *   **Hofmann's Rule:** This rule applies when a sterically bulky base is used. The bulky base preferentially removes the most accessible, least sterically hindered proton, leading to the less substituted alkene. 3-methylcyclohexene is a disubstituted alkene.\n\n    Because potassium tert-butoxide is a large, bulky base, it encounters more steric hindrance when trying to remove the proton from C2 (due to the presence of the adjacent methyl group) compared to the proton on C6. Therefore, the reaction favors the abstraction of the proton from C6, leading to the Hofmann product.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is the less substituted alkene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
