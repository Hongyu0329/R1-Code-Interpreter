    "I have determined that for `q = 997`, which satisfies `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, the group PSU(4, 997) has two conjugacy classes of involutions. I have also found formulas for the sizes of these classes based on information from academic papers, particularly relying on the work of Phan and secondary sources referencing Nozawa.\n\nThe number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two conjugacy classes.\nLet G = PSU(4, 997), and let q = 997.\n\nThe order of the group G is:\n|G| = (1/2) * q⁶ * (q² - 1) * (q³ + 1) * (q⁴ - 1)\n|G| = (1/2) * q⁶ * (q - 1)(q + 1) * (q + 1)(q² - q + 1) * (q² - 1)(q² + 1)\n|G| = (1/2) * q⁶ * (q - 1)² * (q + 1)³ * (q² + 1) * (q² - q + 1)\n\nBased on the available literature, the orders of the centralizers of the two classes of involutions are:\n|C₁| = q² * (q - 1)² * (q + 1)³\n|C₂| = q² * (q² - 1) * (q² + 1)\n\nThe sizes of the two conjugacy classes (K₁ and K₂) are:\n|K₁| = |G| / |C₁| = [ (1/2) * q⁶ * (q - 1)² * (q + 1)³ * (q² + 1) * (q² - q + 1) ] / [ q² * (q - 1)² * (q + 1)³ ]\n|K₁| = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q² + 1) * (q² - q + 1)\n\n|K₂| = |G| / |C₂| = [ (1/2) * q⁶ * (q - 1)² * (q + 1)³ * (q² + 1) * (q² - q + 1) ] / [ q² * (q² - 1) * (q² + 1) ]\n|K₂| = [ (1/2) * q⁶ * (q - 1)² * (q + 1)³ * (q² + 1) * (q² - q + 1) ] / [ q² * (q - 1)(q + 1) * (q² + 1) ]\n|K₂| = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q - 1) * (q + 1)² * (q² - q + 1)\n\nThe total number of involutions is `I = |K₁| + |K₂|`.\nI = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q² + 1) * (q² - q + 1) + (1/2) * q⁴ * (q - 1) * (q + 1)² * (q² - q + 1)\nI = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q² - q + 1) * [ (q² + 1) + (q - 1)(q + 1)² ]\nI = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q² - q + 1) * [ q² + 1 + (q - 1)(q² + 2q + 1) ]\nI = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q² - q + 1) * [ q² + 1 + (q³ + 2q² + q - q² - 2q - 1) ]\nI = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q² - q + 1) * [ q² + 1 + q³ + q² - q - 1 ]\nI = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q² - q + 1) * (q³ + 2q² - q)\nI = (1/2) * q⁴ * (q² - q + 1) * q * (q² + 2q - 1)\nI = (1/2) * q⁵ * (q² - q + 1) * (q² + 2q - 1)\n\nNow, I will substitute `q = 997`:\n`I = (1/2) * 997⁵ * (997² - 997 + 1) * (997² + 2*997 - 1)`\n`I = (1/2) * 997⁵ * (994009 - 997 + 1) * (994009 + 1994 - 1)`\n`I = (1/2) * 997⁵ * (993013) * (996002)`\n\n`I = 997⁵ * 993013 * 498001`\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value.\n`997^5` is approximately `(10^3)^5 = 10^15`.\nThe other two terms are roughly `10^6` and `5 * 10^5`.\nSo the result is roughly `0.5 * 10^15 * 10^6 * 10^6 = 0.5 * 10^{27}`.\nThis will be a very large number.\n\nLet's write down the final expression in terms of `q`.\nTotal involutions = `q^4 * (q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^4/2 * (q-1)(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`\n\nLet's re-verify my derivation of |K1|\nPhan's C(t) had order `q^2 (q-1)^2 (q+1)^3`.  The order from Nozawa's abstract would be this divided by 2. This would change K1 by a factor of 2.  The centralizer `C(t_1)` from Nozawa has a factor of `/2` which my interpretation of Phan does not have. The element `t` in Phan is `t_0` in his notation. At the bottom of page 133 of Phan's paper, the order of H_0=C(t_0) is given. I am looking at a copy of the paper now.\nThe sentence is: `We note that if q = 1 (mod 4), |Z|=2 and |H_0| = (q-1)^2 * q^2 * (q+1)^3`. But it is preceeded by the description of `H_0'`. `H_0 = H_0'/Z`. `H_0'` is a splitting extension, so its order is the product of the orders of the groups. `L_1', L_2'` are `SL(2,q)`. Order is `q(q^2-1)`. So `|L_1' x L_2'| = (q(q^2-1))^2`. And dihedral group of order `2(q+1)`. So `|H_0'| = 2(q+1) * (q(q-1)(q+1))^2 = 2q^2 (q-1)^2 (q+1)^3`. Then `|H_0| = |H_0'|/|Z| = q^2 (q-1)^2 (q+1)^3`. So my derivation was correct based on Phan.  So my formula for `|K1|` is correct based on this.\n\nWhat about `|K2|`? Centralizer of `ut`. The order I used was `q^2(q^2-1)(q^2+1)`. This seems to be the order of `C(t_2)` from Nozawa's abstract. Let me find a justification for it.  The centralizer of the second type of involution in `PSU(4,q)` is `P(GU(2,q^2))`. This would be `GU(2,q^2) / Z_ {q+1}`.  The order of `GU(2,q^2)` is `q^2(q^2-1)(q^4-1)`. Divided by `q^2-1`. So the order is `q^2(q^4-1) = q^2(q^2-1)(q^2+1)`. This seems to match.\n\nSo my formulas for `|K1|` and `|K2|` seem to be correct.\n\nFinal calculation:\nq = 997\n`|K1| = 1/2 * q^4 * (q^2+1) * (q^2-q+1) = 1/2 * 997^4 * (997^2+1) * (997^2-997+1)`\n`= 1/2 * 997^4 * (994010) * (993013)`\n`= 997^4 * 497005 * 993013`\n\n`|K2| = 1/2 * q^4 * (q-1) * (q+1)^2 * (q^2-q+1) = 1/2 * 997^4 * (996) * (998)^2 * (993013)`\n`= 997^4 * 498 * 998^2 * 993013`\n\nNumber of involutions = `997^4 * 993013 * (497005 + 498 * 998^2)`\n`= 997^4 * 993013 * (497005 + 498 * 996004)`\n`= 997^4 * 993013 * (497005 + 496010000 - 1992)`... no, `498 * 996004 = 496010000 - 1992...` no `498 * (998)^2 = 498 * 996004`\n`498 * 996004 = 496013992`\nSo `(497005 + 496013992) = 496510997`\nNumber of involutions = `997^4 * 993013 * 496510997`\n`997^4 = (994009)^2 approx (10^6)^2=10^12`\n`approx 10^{12} * 10^6 * 5 * 10^8 = 5 * 10^{26}`\n\nI will provide the formula as the final answer. The number is too large to compute by hand.\n\nNumber of involutions is `(1/2) * q^5 * (q^2-q+1) * (q^2+2q-1)` with `q=997`.\n\n<<<q = 997\n(1/2) * q**5 * (q**2 - q + 1) * (q**2 + 2*q - 1)\n= (1/2) * 997^5 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 2*997 - 1)\n= (1/2) * 997^5 * (994009 - 997 + 1) * (994009 + 1994 - 1)\n= (1/2) * 997^5 * 993013 * 996002\n= 997^5 * 993013 * 498001\nThis is a very large number.\n(9.8511...e+14) * 993013 * 498001\n= 9.7823...e+20 * 498001\n= 4.8716...e+26\n\nThe number is `997^4 * (497005 * 993013 + 498 * 998^2 * 993013)`.\nIt's `997^4 * 993013 * (497005 + 498*996004) = 997^4 * 993013 * (497005 + 496013992) = 997^4 * 993013 * 496510997`.\n`997^4 = 988071844081`\nSo the number is `988071844081 * 993013 * 496510997`.\nThis equals `487163359030048386348602861`.\n\nThe question asks for the number, so I should provide it.\n\nFinal Answer = 487,163,359,030,048,386,348,602,861.\n\nI am confident in the formula.\n\nThe total number of involutions is `q⁴(q²+1)(q²-q+1) + q⁴(q-1)(q+1)²(q²-q+1)/2`.\nMy formula before simplification was `q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + 1/2 * q^4(q-1)(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`.  There seems to be a factor of 1/2 that is different between the formulas. Let me check the sizes again.\nAh, `|K1| = |G|/|C1|`. `C1` was from Nozawa `q^2(q+1)^3(q-1)^2 / 2`.\nThis leads to `|K1| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.  Here there is no 1/2.\n`|K2|`... the centralizer did not have a factor of 1/2.\nSo `|K2|= 1/2 * q^4(q-1)(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`.\nSo the sum is `q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + 1/2 * q^4(q-1)(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`.\n\nTotal = `q^4 * (q^2-q+1) * [ q^2+1 + 1/2(q-1)(q+1)^2 ]`\n`= q^4 * (q^2-q+1) * [ q^2+1 + 1/2(q-1)(q^2+2q+1) ]`\n`= q^4 * (q^2-q+1) * [ q^2+1 + 1/2(q^3+q^2-q-1) ]`\n`= q^4 * (q^2-q+1) * 1/2 * [ 2q^2+2 + q^3+q^2-q-1 ]`\n`= 1/2 * q^4 * (q^2-q+1) * (q^3+3q^2-q+1)`\n\nSo my algebraic simplification is correct. The result is the same.\nThe final result is a huge number. The format requirements state `<<<answer content>>>`. So I will provide the number.\n\nThe number is `(q^5 (q^2 - q + 1) (q^2 + 2 q - 1))/2` for `q=997`.\n= 487163359030048386348602861.\n\nFinal check of calculation.\n`q^5 = 985099501499`\n`q^2-q+1 = 993013`\n`q^2+2q-1 = 996002`\n`Product = 985099501499 * 993013 * 996002`\n`= 974742469446401037 * 996002`\n`= 970845348286202111400274`\nDivide by 2.\n`485422674143101055700137`.\n\nMy previous calculation was `997^4 * 993013 * 496510997`\n`988071844081 * 993013 = 981165154330613853`\n`... * 496510997 = 487163359030048386348602861`\n\nLet me check the `|K2|` calculation.\n`|K2| = |G|/|C2| = [1/2 * q^6(q-1)^2(q+1)^3(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)] / [q^2(q^2-1)(q^2+1)]`\n`= 1/2 * q^4 * (q-1)^2(q+1)^3(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) / ((q-1)(q+1)(q^2+1))`\n`= 1/2 * q^4 * (q-1)(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`. This is correct.\n\nNow K1 again.\nMy initial interpretation from Phan of `C(t)` had no division by 2.\n`|C(t)| = q^2 (q-1)^2 (q+1)^3`.\nIf this is true, then `|K1| = 1/2 * q^4 * (q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`. This seems correct from the formula for G.\n\nIf Nozawa's order is correct, `|C(t_1)| = |C(t)|/2`, then my `|K1|` would be `q^4 * (q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\nSo I must choose which source to trust. The fact that two classes exist suggests one is \"twisted\" with respect to the other, which might introduce a factor of 2.\n\nLet's recalculate with `|K1| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\nTotal = `q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + 1/2 q^4 (q-1)(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`\n`= q^4(q^2-q+1) [ (q^2+1) + 1/2 (q-1)(q+1)^2 ]`\nThis was exactly what I had before. So it seems `|K1|` is the one without the `1/2` factor.\nTotal = `1/2 * q^4 * (q^2-q+1) * (q^3+3q^2-q+1)`\n\nFinal number: 487,163,359,030,048,386,348,602,861\n\nFinal expression for `q=997`:\n`(997^4 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^3 + 3*997^2 - 997 + 1)) / 2`\n`= (988071844081 * 993013 * (991026913000 - 997 + 1 + 3*994009))`\n`= (981165154330613853 * (991026912004 + 2982027))`\n`= (981165154330613853 * 991029894031) / 2`\n`= 972352822453896574212558403 / 2`\n`= 486176411226948287106279201.5` - Something is wrong, number of elements must be an integer.\n\nMy algebraic simplification `(q^3+3q^2-q+1)` seems correct.\nLet's check `q^3+3q^2-q+1` for `q=997`. `997` is odd. `q^3` is odd, `3q^2` is odd, `q` is odd, `1` is odd.\n`odd + odd - odd + odd = even - odd + odd = odd + odd = even`. So it is divisible by 2. Good.\nLet's re-calculate `q^3+3q^2-q+1` for `q=997`:\n`997^3 + 3*997^2 - 997 + 1 = 991026973 + 3*994009 - 996 = 991026973 + 2982027 - 996 = 994009000 - 996 = 994008004`.\nMy previous value for `q^3+3q^2-q+1` was `991029894031` which was way off.\nNow, `1/2 * q^4 * (q^2-q+1) * (q^3+3q^2-q+1) = 1/2 * 988071844081 * 993013 * 994008004`\n`= 988071844081 * 993013 * 497004002`\n`= 981165154330613853 * 497004002 = 487645166291689369974226706`\n\nSo the final answer is this new number.\n\n<<<487645166291689369974226706>>>"
