The ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize catalytic performance differs for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). For WGS, ratios from 2.5 atomic % to 12.5 wt% Ni have shown high activity depending on the catalyst preparation. For water splitting, a higher nickel content is often favored, with optimal ratios reported as 3:1 and 9:1 (Ni:Ce) in different catalyst systems. Therefore, a single ideal ratio for both reactions does not exist.
