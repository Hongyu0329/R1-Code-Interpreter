    "I have gathered information about the definition and structure of semidihedral groups, and what power subgroups are.\n\nA semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD512, has the order 2^9. The presentation of a semidihedral group of order 2^n is generally given as ⟨r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1)⟩. For SD512, n=9, so the presentation is ⟨r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127⟩.\n\nA power subgroup G^k is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G.\n\nI need to determine the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way for the semidihedral group of size 512. The provided search results discuss the general structure of semidihedral groups and their subgroups, but they do not directly state how to count the number of power subgroups. I need to find a method to determine the power subgroups G^k for different values of k.\n\nI will proceed with the following steps:\n1.  Identify the possible non-trivial power subgroups. Since the order of the group is 512, the orders of elements are powers of 2. Therefore, we only need to consider k that are powers of 2.\n2.  For each relevant k, I will determine the set of k-th powers of all elements in SD512 and then determine the subgroup generated by this set.\n3.  I will then count the number of distinct subgroups obtained in the previous step.\n\nI need to perform further searches to find specific information about the power subgroups of semidihedral groups or a general method to compute them for groups of this type.I have gathered more information about semidihedral groups. Let G = SD_512. The presentation of G is <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(128-1) = r^127>.\nThe elements of G are of the form r^i and r^i * s for 0 <= i < 256.\n\nA power subgroup G^k is the subgroup generated by the set of all k-th powers of elements of G, {g^k | g in G}. We need to find the number of distinct such subgroups.\n\nLet's analyze the k-th powers of elements in G.\nThe elements are of two types: those in the cyclic subgroup <r> and those of the form r^i * s.\n(r^i)^k = r^(ik).\nNow let's consider (r^i * s)^k.\nFor k=2, (r^i * s)^2 = r^i * s * r^i * s = r^i * (s * r^i * s^(-1)) * s^2 = r^i * (r^(127))^i = r^i * r^(127i) = r^(128i).\nSo the set of 2nd powers is {r^(2i)} U {r^(128i)}. Since i can be any integer from 0 to 255, the set of 2nd powers is <r^2> U <r^128> = <r^2>. So G^2 = <r^2>.\n\nFor k to be an odd integer, let's analyze (r^i * s)^k. Since s has order 2, (r^i*s)^k will be of the form r^j*s. Therefore, for odd k, the set of k-th powers will contain elements of the form r^j*s. The subgroup generated by these elements will contain s and hence cannot be a subgroup of <r>. If it contains 's' and some r^j, it will be the whole group G.\n\nLet's verify this. Let k be an odd integer. The set of k-th powers is {(r^i)^k} U {(r^i*s)^k}.\n(r^i*s)^k = (r^i*s)*(r^i*s)*...*(r^i*s) (k times).\n(r^i * s)^k = r^i * (s*r^i*s) * (s*r^i*s) *...* s = r^i * (r^127i) *...*s\nLet's compute (r^i*s)^3 = r^i*s*r^i*s*r^i*s = r^i*r^(127i)*r^i*s = r^(128i+i)*r^i*s = r^(129i)*s. No, this seems complicated.\n\nLet's use the property s*r^j*s = r^(127j).\n(r^i*s)^2 = r^(128i)\n(r^i*s)^3 = (r^i*s)^2 * (r^i*s) = r^(128i) * r^i * s = r^(129i)*s. No this is incorrect.\n(r^i * s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (s r^i s) = r^i r^(127i) = r^(128i).\n(r^i * s)^3 = (r^i s)^2 (r^i s) = r^(128i) r^i s = r^(129i)s. Still seems incorrect.\n\nLet's try again. (r^i*s) * (r^i*s) = r^i * s*r^i*s = r^i * r^(127i) = r^(128i).\nThen (r^i*s)^k = ((r^i*s)^2)^(k/2) if k is even, but k is odd.\nLet's look at the structure of elements. The elements of the form r^i*s are involutions (order 2) if 128 divides i. So for example, s, r^128*s are of order 2. Let's check (r^j*s)^2 = r^(128j). If j is odd, this is r^128, not e. So not all elements of the form r^i*s are of order 2.\n\nOrder of r^i*s: (r^i*s)^2 = r^(128i). If we want this to be the identity, 256 must divide 128i, so i must be even. So, r^i*s for odd i has order 4, and for even i, it has order 2 if i is a multiple of 2 but not 4? No. (r^i*s)^2 = r^(128i). Order is 2 iff 128i is a multiple of 256, so i is even. The square is r^128 if i is odd. So (r^i*s)^4 = (r^128)^2 = r^256 = e. So elements r^i*s have order 4 if i is odd, and order 2 if i is even.\n\nNow back to G^k.\nIf k is odd, k=2m+1. Then (r^i*s)^k = ((r^i*s)^2)^m * (r^i*s) = (r^(128i))^m * r^i*s = r^(128im) * r^i * s = r^(i(128m+1))*s.\nThe set of k-th powers is {r^(ik)} U {r^(i(128m+1))*s}.\nSince m=(k-1)/2, 128m+1 = 64(k-1)+1.\nSo the generating set for G^k contains elements of the form r^(...)s. If k is coprime to 256, then {r^(ik)} generates <r>. The other generators are of the form r^(...)s. If we have r and s in the generating set, we have the whole group G. For k odd, g^k generates G for any g that is a generator of G. Since s^k=s and r^k generates <r>, then G^k=<r,s>=G.\n\nIf k is even, let k = 2j.\n(r^i)^k = r^(2ij).\n(r^i*s)^k = (r^(128i))^j.\nThe set of k-th powers is {r^(2ij)} U {(r^(128i))^j}. This is {r^(kj)} U {r^(64k*i)}.\nThe subgroup generated by these is <r^k, r^(64k)>. Which simplifies to <r^k>. No, this is wrong.\n(r^i*s)^k = (r^i*s)^(2j) = ( (r^i*s)^2 )^j = (r^(128i))^j = r^(128ij). So G^k = <{r^(ki), r^(128ij)}>. Which is <r^k, r^(64k)>. Let me recalculate.\n(r^i*s)^k = r^(128ij). And k=2j. So (r^i*s)^k = r^(64ik). The subgroup generated is <r^k, r^(64k)>.\nSince k is a power of 2, 64k is a multiple of k. So G^k = <r^k>.\n\nThe possible values for k are powers of 2 dividing the exponent of the group, which is 256. The exponent of SD_2^n is 2^(n-1). So here it's 256.\nThe possible k are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\nAlso k=1 gives G^1 = G.\nFor k=2, G^2 = <r^2>.\nFor k=4, G^4 = <r^4>.\n...\nFor k=256, G^256 = <r^256> = {e}.\nAlso for k being any multiple of 256, the power subgroup is the trivial one.\nSo the distinct power subgroups are G, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, <r^256> = {e}.\nThere seem to be 9 such subgroups.\n\nLet's double-check the case of k being odd.\nLet k be an odd integer.\nG^k = < { (r^i)^k | 0<=i<256 } U { (r^i*s)^k | 0<=i<256 } >\n= < { r^(ik) } U { r^(i(64(k-1)+1))*s } >\nLet i=1 and k be coprime to 256. Then r^k is a generator of <r>. Let's say k is 3.\nG^3 = < {r^(3i)} U {r^(i(128+1))*s} > = < r^3, r^(129)*s >.\nSince <r^3>=<r>, the generating set contains r and an element of the form r^j*s. So it generates G.\nWhat if k is odd but not coprime to 256? E.g. no such k for SD_512. Any odd k is coprime to 256.\n\nWhat if k is not a power of 2? Say k=3. G^3=G.\nSay k=6. k is even, so G^6 = <r^6>.\nSay k=10. G^10 = <r^10>.\nSay k=12. G^12 = <r^12>.\n\nThe set of power subgroups is { G^k | k is a positive integer}.\nWe found that if k is odd, G^k = G.\nIf k is even, G^k = <r^k>.\nSo the set of power subgroups is {G} U { <r^k> | k is a positive even integer }.\nThe subgroups <r^k> are of the form <r^d> where d is a divisor of 256.\nThe divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\nSo the subgroups of the form <r^d> where d is a divisor of 256 are:\n<r^1> = <r>\n<r^2>\n<r^4>\n...\n<r^256> = {e}\nThis gives 9 subgroups.\nNow we consider all even k. For any even k, G^k = <r^k>. Let the greatest common divisor of k and 256 be d. Then <r^k> = <r^d>.\nSo the distinct subgroups of the form <r^k> for even k are the subgroups <r^d> where d is an even divisor of 256.\nThe even divisors of 256 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\nThis gives 8 subgroups.\nAnd for any odd k, G^k = G. This is another distinct subgroup.\nSo we have {G} U { <r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^256>}.\nSo the power subgroups are G, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, {e} (which is <r^256>).\nThat is a total of 9 distinct subgroups.\n\nI should check my calculation of (r^i * s)^k for k even.\nLet k = 2j.\n(r^i * s)^k = ( (r^i*s)^2 )^j = (r^(128i))^j = r^(128ij) = r^(64ik).\nThe set of k-th powers is S_k = {r^(ik)} U {r^(64ik)}.\nThe subgroup generated by this set is G^k = <S_k> = < <r^(ik)>_i, <r^(64ik)>_i >.\nLet d = gcd(k, 256). <r^(ik)>_i generates <r^d>.\nLet d' = gcd(64k, 256). <r^(64ik)>_i generates <r^d'>.\nSo G^k = <r^d, r^d'>. Since d divides d', G^k = <r^d>.\nHere d = gcd(k, 256).\nSo, if k is even, the power subgroup is <r^gcd(k,256)>.\nThe possible values for gcd(k,256) for even k are the even divisors of 256, which are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\nThis gives us 8 subgroups: <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, <r^256> = {e}.\nIf k is odd, G^k=G. This adds one more subgroup.\nSo in total, there are 8 + 1 = 9 power subgroups.\n\nThe list of power subgroups is:\n1. G (for any odd k)\n2. <r^2> (e.g., for k=2)\n3. <r^4> (e.g., for k=4)\n4. <r^8> (e.g., for k=8)\n5. <r^16> (e.g., for k=16)\n6. <r^32> (e.g., for k=32)\n7. <r^64> (e.g., for k=64)\n8. <r^128> (e.g., for k=128)\n9. {e} (e.g., for k=256)\n\nThese are 9 distinct subgroups. I feel confident in this answer.The user wants to know the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\nBased on my previous analysis, let G = SD_512. The presentation of G is <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>.\n\nA power subgroup G^k is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements of G.\n\nMy analysis of the power subgroups G^k for different integers k showed:\n- If k is an odd integer, G^k = G.\n- If k is an even integer, G^k = <r^d> where d = gcd(k, 256).\n\nNow, I need to count the number of distinct subgroups that arise from these two cases.\n\nCase 1: k is odd.\nIn this case, the only power subgroup is G itself. This gives one power subgroup.\n\nCase 2: k is even.\nThe power subgroup is of the form <r^d> where d = gcd(k, 256). Since k is even, d must also be even. The divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. The even divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\nThis gives rise to the following subgroups:\n- <r^2>\n- <r^4>\n- <r^8>\n- <r^16>\n- <r^32>\n- <r^64>\n- <r^128>\n- <r^256> = {e} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThese are 8 distinct subgroups.\n\nCombining both cases, the set of all power subgroups is {G, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, {e}}.\n\nThese are all distinct. G is not a cyclic subgroup of the form <r^d>, and all the <r^d> for different d that are divisors of 256 are distinct.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct power subgroups is 1 (from odd k) + 8 (from even k) = 9.\n\nI have not found any information that contradicts this reasoning in my last search. The search results provide general information about the structure of semidihedral groups and their subgroups, but nothing specific about the number of power subgroups. The analysis seems sound based on the group's presentation and element properties. Therefore, I can finalize the answer.\nThe semidihedral group of size 512 is given by the presentation G = <r, s | r^256 = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^(256/2 - 1) = r^127>. The elements of G are of the form r^i and r^i * s for 0 <= i < 256.\n\nA power subgroup G^k is the subgroup generated by the set of all k-th powers of elements in G.\n\nIf k is an odd integer, the set of k-th powers of elements in the cyclic subgroup <r> generates <r^k> = <r> since k is coprime to 256. The k-th power of an element of the form r^i * s is (r^i * s)^k = r^(i*(128*((k-1)/2)+1)) * s. The presence of these elements of the form r^j*s, along with the generator r of the cyclic part, ensures that the whole group G is generated. So, for any odd k, G^k = G.\n\nIf k is an even integer, let k = 2j. The k-th power of r^i is r^(ik). The k-th power of r^i * s is (r^i * s)^k = ((r^i * s)^2)^j = (r^(128i))^j = r^(128ij) = r^(64ik). The subgroup G^k is therefore generated by {r^(ik), r^(64ik) | 0 <= i < 256}, which simplifies to <r^k, r^(64k)>. Since k is a power of 2, k divides 64k, so this is just <r^k>. More generally, for any even k, G^k = <r^gcd(k, 256)>. The possible values of gcd(k, 256) for even k are the even divisors of 256.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are:\n1. G (for any odd k)\n2. <r^2>\n3. <r^4>\n4. <r^8>\n5. <r^16>\n6. <r^32>\n7. <r^64>\n8. <r^128>\n9. <r^256> = {e} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we have 1 + 8 = 9 power subgroups.\n\n"
