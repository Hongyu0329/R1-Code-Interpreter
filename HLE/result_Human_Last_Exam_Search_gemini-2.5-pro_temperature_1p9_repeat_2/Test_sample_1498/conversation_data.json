    "In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the twenty-five prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are listed in four consecutive couplets (abyat).\n\nThe section dedicated to the prophets begins after the introductory couplet:\n**تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ *** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ**\n(A detailed account of twenty-five is binding *** upon every accountable person, so realize this and seize the opportunity)\n\nThe names of the prophets are mentioned from the following *bayt* to the fourth one after it. The enumeration starts with the couplet that begins with the names of Prophet Adam, Idris, and Nuh, and concludes with the couplet that mentions Prophet Muhammad (referred to as Taha).\n\nTherefore, the names of the prophets are mentioned in the four couplets starting from:\n\n**هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ *** صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ**\n(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is followed)\n\nAnd ending with:\n\n**إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيًّا**\n(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [a name for Prophet Muhammad], the final one, leave misguidance)\n\n<<<The names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned in the four couplets of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that start with the verse \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ...\" and end with the verse \"...عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيًّا\".>>>"
