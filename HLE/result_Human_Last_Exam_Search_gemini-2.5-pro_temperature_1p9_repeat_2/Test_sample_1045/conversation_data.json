    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, meaning it is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the 6-31G basis set:\n*   Each hydrogen atom is represented by 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n*   Each carbon atom is represented by 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nTherefore, for a toluene molecule:\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms will use 8 * 2 = 16 contracted Gaussian functions.\n*   The 7 carbon atoms will use 7 * 9 = 63 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of the functions for all atoms:\nTotal functions = (Number of C atoms * Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms * Functions per H)\nTotal functions = (7 * 9) + (8 * 2) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\nA 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene (C7H8) uses a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nEach of the seven carbon atoms is described by 9 contracted basis functions (a 1s core orbital, an inner and outer 2s valence orbital, and an inner and outer set of 2p orbitals (px, py, pz)).\nEach of the eight hydrogen atoms is described by 2 contracted basis functions (an inner and outer 1s orbital).\n\nTotal for Carbon: 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\nTotal for Hydrogen: 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\nTotal for Toluene: 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\nFor a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms in Toluene:** The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8, which means it consists of 7 carbon (C) atoms and 8 hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of functions per atom:** The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. The number of contracted functions for each type of atom is as follows:\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom** (a \"heavy\" or non-hydrogen atom), there are 9 basis functions. This includes one function for the core (1s) orbital, and four functions for both the inner and outer parts of the valence shell (2s and 2p).\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom**, there are 2 basis functions, representing the split valence 1s orbital.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions:**\n    *   The 7 carbon atoms contribute: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n    *   The 8 hydrogen atoms contribute: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n    *   The total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of these two values: 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
