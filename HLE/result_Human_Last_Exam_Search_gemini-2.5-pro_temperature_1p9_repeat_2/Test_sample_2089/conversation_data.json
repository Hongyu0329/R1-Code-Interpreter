    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is a scenario that does not appear to match any known movie.\n\nWhile there are notable Oscar-nominated films with pivotal bus scenes, such as *It Happened One Night*, *Midnight Cowboy*, and *The Shawshank Redemption*, none of them feature a character meeting their demise after uttering \"Thank you\" upon boarding.\n\nIn *Midnight Cowboy*, the character Ratso Rizzo does die on a bus, but his final moments do not involve this specific line of dialogue. Similarly, while the film *Cast Away* features the last words \"thank you,\" this occurs at a crossroads, not on a bus. The film *Thank You for Your Service* also includes a bus scene where one character sends another to a rehabilitation center, but it does not align with the described fateful event.\n\nExtensive searches for this particular sequence of events in an Oscar-nominated film have not yielded any matching results. It is possible the film in question was not Oscar-nominated or that the details of the scene have been misremembered.\n\n<<<I am unable to find an Oscar-nominated film that matches the description provided.>>>"
