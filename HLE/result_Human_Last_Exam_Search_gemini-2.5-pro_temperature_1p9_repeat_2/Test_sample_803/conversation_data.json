    "Here is a summary of the findings regarding nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number.\n\nA finite group G is defined as **filled** if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G is also \"complete\". A product-free set S is a non-empty subset of G such that the product of any two elements in S is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A set S is complete (or \"fills\" G) if every non-identity element of G is either in S or can be expressed as a product of two elements from S.\n\nThe classification of nonabelian filled groups is an ongoing area of mathematical research. While a complete classification for all groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> is not yet available, significant results have been established for certain families of groups, particularly dihedral groups.\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n*   **Groups of Odd Order:** The only filled groups of odd order are the cyclic groups C₃ and C₅. This result provides a complete classification for this category of groups.\n*   **Dihedral Groups (D<sub>2n</sub>):** Much of the research on nonabelian filled groups has focused on dihedral groups. The dihedral group of order 2n, denoted D<sub>2n</sub>, is a nonabelian group for n ≥ 3. For groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, the relevant dihedral group is D<sub>2q<sup>m</sup></sub>.\n    *   It has been proven that the dihedral groups D₆ (isomorphic to S₃), D₈, and D₁₀ are filled. Of these, D₆ (order 2 * 3¹) and D₁₀ (order 2 * 5¹) fit the form 2q<sup>m</sup>.\n    *   A conjecture by Street and Whitehead, which stated that D<sub>2n</sub> is not filled when n = 6k + 1, has been disproven. This indicates that there are filled dihedral groups beyond the initial small examples.\n    *   Research by Anabanti and Hart provides classifications of locally maximal product-free sets for dihedral groups which helps in determining if they are filled. For instance, their work implies that for a prime p > 3, if a locally maximal product-free set of size 4 exists in D<sub>2p</sub>, then p must be 5 or 7.\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Groups:** It has been shown that no generalized quaternion group is filled.\n*   **Nilpotent Groups:** If a filled group is nilpotent (a more general condition than being a p-group), it must be a 2-group or isomorphic to C₃ or C₅. The only filled nonabelian dihedral 2-group is D₈.\n\n### Identified Nonabelian Filled Groups of Order 2q<sup>m</sup>:\n\nBased on the available literature, the known nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> are:\n\n*   **D₆ ≅ S₃** (order 6 = 2 * 3¹, where q=3, m=1)\n*   **D₁₀** (order 10 = 2 * 5¹, where q=5, m=1)\n*   Other dihedral groups may also be filled, but a complete and straightforward classification for all q and m is not yet established. The determination of whether a dihedral group is filled depends on the intricate properties of its maximal product-free sets.\n\nIn summary, while there is no complete list of all nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for any odd prime q and natural number m, the current body of research points towards specific instances of dihedral groups being the primary candidates. The problem of providing a full classification remains an open question in group theory.\n\n<<<The known nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are specific instances of dihedral groups, including $D_6$ (order $2 \\cdot 3^1$) and $D_{10}$ (order $2 \\cdot 5^1$). A complete classification for all such groups is not yet established in the mathematical literature.>>>"
