The known nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are specific instances of dihedral groups, including $D_6$ (order $2 \cdot 3^1$) and $D_{10}$ (order $2 \cdot 5^1$). A complete classification for all such groups is not yet established in the mathematical literature.
