    "I am unable to provide a definitive answer to your question. After conducting an extensive search for a video of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman solo\" in William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett from 2015, I was unable to locate a viewable recording.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that Svetlana Gileva did perform this role with the Semperoper Ballett during that period, and video clips were officially released. However, the links to these videos are no longer active, and the content is listed as unavailable.\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized step in ballet terminology but appears to be a colloquial descriptor for a sequence of movements. Without being able to analyze the specific choreography performed by Ms. Gileva, it is impossible to identify which steps might be interpreted as \"pas de Balanchine\" and, consequently, to provide a count.\n\nTherefore, a conclusive answer cannot be given without access to the visual recording of the performance.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question.>>>"
