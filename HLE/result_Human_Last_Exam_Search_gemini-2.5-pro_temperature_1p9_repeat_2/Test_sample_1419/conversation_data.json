    "### The Leading Order Expression for the Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling\n\nIn the vicinity of four dimensions, the ϕ⁴ theory exhibits a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The leading order expression for this fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, can be determined through the epsilon expansion, where ϵ = 4 - d represents the deviation from four spatial dimensions.\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) beta function for the coupling constant, λ, in an O(N)-symmetric ϕ⁴ theory to one-loop order is given by:\n\n```\nβ(λ) = -ϵλ + (N + 8) / (8π²) * λ²\n```\n\n\nHere, N represents the number of components of the scalar field. The fixed point of the theory is found by setting the beta function to zero (β(λ*) = 0), which corresponds to a scale-invariant theory.\n\nSetting the above equation to zero and solving for the non-trivial fixed point coupling λ* gives:\n\n```\n-ϵλ* + (N + 8) / (8π²) * (λ*)² = 0\n```\n\nThis yields the solution for the fixed point coupling at leading order in ϵ:\n\n```\nλ* = (8π² / (N + 8)) * ϵ\n```\n\n\nFor the specific case of a single-component scalar ϕ⁴ theory, we set N = 1. This is the simplest case and is often what is implicitly meant by \"ϕ⁴ theory\". The fixed point coupling, often denoted as u*, is then:\n\n```\nu* = (8π² / 9) * ϵ\n```\n\nDifferent normalization conventions for the coupling constant can lead to different numerical prefactors. For instance, some conventions result in a beta function of the form β(u) = -ϵu + bu², where the constant 'b' depends on the specific conventions used in the calculation. However, the essential linear dependence of the fixed point coupling on ϵ at the leading order remains a universal feature of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\n<<<u* = (8π² / (N + 8)) * ϵ>>>"
