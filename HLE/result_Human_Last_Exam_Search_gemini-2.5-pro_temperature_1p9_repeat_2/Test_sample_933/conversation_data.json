    "The most efficient and widely documented method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is through the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas.\n\nThis process involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, typically in a 1:5 molar ratio, within a nickel container. The most frequently cited temperature for this reaction to proceed efficiently is 400°C. A patent for this process also specifies a temperature range of 350 to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature.\n\nWhile the reaction can occur over a range of temperatures, for instance in a flow system at 300-500°C, the equilibrium between the different xenon fluorides is temperature-dependent. At lower temperatures, the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂) is favored. Although thermal reactions to produce xenon fluorides have been observed at temperatures as low as 120°C, higher temperatures are required for the efficient production of XeF₄.\n\nMethods involving electric discharge at low temperatures have been explored but tend to yield significant impurities, particularly XeF₂.\n\nConsidering the provided options, 400°C is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently according to the available evidence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
