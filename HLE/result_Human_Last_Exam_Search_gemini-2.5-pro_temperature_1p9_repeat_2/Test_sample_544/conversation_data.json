    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in a Pummerer-type reaction.\n\nThe reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Activation:** The oxygen of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This forms a triflyloxysulfonium intermediate, [C₆H₅S(OTf)CH₃]⁺. Triflic anhydride is a potent activator for this type of reaction.\n2.  **Formation of a Thionium Ion:** A proton is abstracted from the methyl group, which is adjacent to the positively charged sulfur. This leads to the elimination of triflic acid and the formation of an electrophilic thionium ion, [C₆H₅S=CH₂]⁺.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The trimethylsilyl cyanide serves as a source for the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which is a nucleophile. The cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic carbon of the thionium ion.\n\nThis sequence yields the product with the chemical structure C₆H₅SCH₂CN.\n\nTo determine the IUPAC name of this product, the following rules are applied:\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** The nitrile group (-CN) has a higher priority in nomenclature than the sulfide group (-S-).\n*   **Parent Hydride:** The carbon chain containing the principal functional group has two carbon atoms. The corresponding parent name for a two-carbon nitrile is acetonitrile. The carbon atom of the nitrile group is designated as position 1.\n*   **Substituent:** The substituent attached to the second carbon of the acetonitrile chain is a phenylthio group (C₆H₅S-), also known as a phenylsulfanyl group.\n\nCombining these elements, the correct IUPAC name for the product C₆H₅SCH₂CN is **2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile**.\n\n<<<2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile>>>"
