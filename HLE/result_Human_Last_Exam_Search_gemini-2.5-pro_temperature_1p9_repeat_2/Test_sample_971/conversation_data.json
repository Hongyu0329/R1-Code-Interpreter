    "Based on analysis of a 2008 video showing Natalia Osipova performing the Act I variation from *Don Quixote* as Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet during a guest performance in Novosibirsk, she did not perform any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\nIn the available footage of this specific performance, Osipova executes a dynamic series of traveling turns, specifically chaîné and piqué turns, across the stage. While the choreography for *Don Quixote* can vary between productions and even individual performances, this particular 2008 rendition does not include a sequence of single-turn pirouettes starting from a stationary fifth position. Discussions among ballet enthusiasts mention that the choreography for Kitri's Act I variation sometimes includes pirouettes en dehors. However, the visual evidence from Osipova's documented 2008 performance does not show this specific step.\n\nTherefore, in the specified 2008 performance, the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position performed by Natalia Osipova in the Act I variation was zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
