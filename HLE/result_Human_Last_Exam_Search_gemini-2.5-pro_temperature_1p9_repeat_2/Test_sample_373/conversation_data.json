    "### Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge is 1/25\n\nIn a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights, the probability of sampling the single bottleneck edge during randomized uniform gossiping is 1-in-25, or 4%. This calculation is based on the specific structure of the graph and the mechanics of the gossiping algorithm.\n\n#### Understanding the Graph Structure\n\nA 10-node barbell graph consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of five nodes each, connected by a single \"bridge\" or \"bottleneck\" edge. Each clique, being a complete graph of 5 nodes, contains 10 edges (calculated as n*(n-1)/2). The entire graph, therefore, has a total of 21 edges: 10 in the first clique, 10 in the second, and the one bottleneck edge connecting them.\n\nThe two nodes connected by this bottleneck edge have a higher number of connections (degree) than the other nodes. Each is connected to the four other nodes in its own clique plus the one node in the opposite clique, for a total degree of 5. The remaining eight nodes (four in each clique) are only connected to the other four nodes within their respective cliques, giving them a degree of 4.\n\n#### The Gossiping Process\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a process where information is spread through a network. In each step, a node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes in the network. This chosen node then selects one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to communicate with. \"Sampling the bottleneck edge\" refers to the event where this randomly selected communication link is the bottleneck edge.\n\n#### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe bottleneck edge can be selected in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  The node at one end of the bottleneck edge is chosen and it, in turn, chooses to gossip with the node at the other end.\n2.  The node at the second end of the bottleneck edge is chosen, and it gossips with the first.\n\nGiven there are 10 nodes, the probability of selecting any single node is 1/10.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** The node from the first clique connected to the bottleneck is chosen (a 1/10 probability). This node has 5 neighbors. The probability of it then choosing the specific neighbor connected by the bottleneck is 1/5. The total probability for this scenario is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\n*   **Scenario 2:** The node from the second clique connected to the bottleneck is chosen (a 1/10 probability). This node also has 5 neighbors, so the probability of it choosing the bottleneck connection is 1/5. The total probability for this scenario is also (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios: 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50, which simplifies to **1/25**. This low probability illustrates why barbell graphs are often used to study network bottlenecks, as the infrequent sampling of the connecting edge can slow down processes like information dissemination and averaging across the entire network.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
