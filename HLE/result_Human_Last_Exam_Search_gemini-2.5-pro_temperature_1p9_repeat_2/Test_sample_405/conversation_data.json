    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least five distinct colors: white, red, violet, black, and scarlet. These different colors arise from the various ways phosphorus atoms can bond together to form different structural arrangements, known as allotropes.\n\nThe most common allotropes and their corresponding colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** When pure, this allotrope is a white, waxy solid. However, it often takes on a yellowish hue due to impurities or upon exposure to light, which causes a gradual transformation to red phosphorus. For this reason, it is also frequently referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is commonly known for its use on the striking surface of matchboxes and its color can vary. It is typically a dark red powder, with shades ranging from orange-red to dark red-purple.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline form is violet or purple. Sometimes it is described as brown-violet.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite. There are two forms, α-black and β-black, both of which are black in color.\n*   **Scarlet Phosphorus:** This allotrope is an amorphous, scarlet-colored powder. It is considered a transitional form between other allotropes.\n\nAdditionally, other allotropes have been synthesized or theorized. For instance, \"blue phosphorus\" is a more recently investigated two-dimensional form, so named due to its predicted electronic properties rather than its observed color as a bulk material. Another allotrope, described as \"fibrous red phosphorus,\" and a \"red/brown\" form have been identified, which are considered variations of red phosphorus. A newly proposed \"butterfly\" allotrope is also predicted to have a red appearance.\n\nTherefore, based on the well-established and observed solid allotropes, there are five primary colors associated with pure phosphorus.\n\n<<<5>>>"
