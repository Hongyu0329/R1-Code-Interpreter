    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly referred to as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**, or more specifically, the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terminology:\n\n*   **Generalized Pair Correlation Function:** In the context of nuclear reactor physics and criticality, this function describes the correlation between neutron populations or detection events at different points in space and at different times. This is a central concept in what is known as \"reactor noise analysis\".\n\n*   **Fourier Transform:** The experimental and theoretical analysis of these correlations is typically performed in the frequency domain.\n    *   The Fourier transform of a time-correlation function between signals from two different neutron detectors is defined as the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD).\n    *   If the correlation is of a single signal with itself (autocorrelation), its Fourier transform is the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD).\n\nThe use of two detectors and the calculation of the CPSD is a standard technique. It allows for the separation of the correlated noise, which contains information about the chain-reacting system, from the uncorrelated noise originating from the detectors themselves. This method is used to determine key reactor physics parameters related to criticality.\n\nWhile the underlying physics involves a correlation function dependent on both space and time, `G(r,t)`, practical \"noise analysis\" experiments often focus on the temporal correlation of signals from detectors at fixed spatial positions. The Fourier transform of this time-correlation function yields the Power Spectral Density. Theoretical treatments may involve a spatial Fourier transform or a modal expansion to handle the spatial dependence, but the most common and practical term for the resulting frequency-domain function is the Power Spectral Density.\n\nAnother related term is the **thermal scattering law**, often denoted as *S(α, β)*, which is the double Fourier transform of the van Hove correlation function. However, this term is specific to the field of neutron thermalization and is used to describe how neutrons scatter off atoms in a material, rather than the criticality of the neutron population as a whole.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density (PSD) or Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)>>>"
