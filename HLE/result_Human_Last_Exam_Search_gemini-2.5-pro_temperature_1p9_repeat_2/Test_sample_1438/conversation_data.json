    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the Pauli exclusion principle is maintained by representing the fermionic fields as Grassmann variables. The key property of a Grassmann variable, η, is that it anti-commutes with other Grassmann variables and, crucially, that its square is zero (η² = 0). This nilpotency directly enforces the Pauli principle, as it is impossible to have two fermions in the same state.\n\nThe integration over these Grassmann variables is defined by the Berezin integral. For a single Grassmann variable η, the measure is defined by the following rules:\n\n*   The integral of the variable itself is 1:\n    ∫ dη η = 1\n*   The integral of any constant (including 1) is 0:\n    ∫ dη 1 = 0\n\nThese two rules define the measure for a single Grassmann variable integral. Consequently, for a general function of a single Grassmann variable, f(η) = A + Bη (since η²=0, any Taylor expansion terminates), the integral is:\n\n∫ dη f(η) = ∫ dη (A + Bη) = A ∫ dη 1 + B ∫ dη η = B\n\nThis means the integral effectively acts like differentiation. It is this definition of the integral measure that is consistent with the anti-commuting nature of fermions and thus upholds the Pauli exclusion principle within the path integral formalism.\n\n<<<The integral of the Grassmann variable itself is defined to be 1, while the integral of a constant is 0."
