It is not possible to prove the existence of Gödel's god-like entities using the customary setting of the mathematics used for quantum mechanics. The two employ fundamentally different mathematical languages and address disparate domains of reality. Gödel's proof is a formal argument in modal logic concerning metaphysics, while the mathematics of quantum mechanics is a framework for describing the probabilistic behavior of the physical world.
