    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the specific heat critical exponent, α, can be calculated systematically as an expansion in the parameter ϵ = d<sub>uc</sub> - d, where d is the spatial dimension and d<sub>uc</sub> is the upper critical dimension. For systems described by the O(n)-symmetric φ⁴ field theory (the n-vector model), the upper critical dimension is d<sub>uc</sub> = 4. The question asks for the exponent in a spatial dimension of d=3, which means the epsilon expansion is performed with ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nThe value of the exponent α depends on the number of components, *n*, of the order parameter, which defines the universality class of the system. The first-order result in the epsilon expansion for α is given by the formula:\n\n**α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) \\* ϵ**\n\nSince the problem does not specify the number of components *n*, we can evaluate α for a few key physical models by substituting ϵ = 1:\n\n*   **n = 1 (Ising Model):** This model describes systems with a single-component order parameter, such as a simple uniaxial magnet or a liquid-gas critical point. For this case:\n    α = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) = 3 / 18 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167\n\n*   **n = 2 (XY Model):** This describes systems with a two-component order parameter, like superfluid helium or easy-plane ferromagnets. For this case:\n    α = (4 - 2) / (2 * (2 + 8)) = 2 / 20 = 1/10 = 0.1\n\n*   **n = 3 (Heisenberg Model):** This pertains to systems with a three-component order parameter, such as isotropic ferromagnets. For this case:\n    α = (4 - 3) / (2 * (3 + 8)) = 1 / 22 ≈ 0.045\n\nNotably, for n=4, the first-order calculation yields α = 0. The expansion provides an approximation, with setting ϵ=1 being an extrapolation from the d → 4 limit. The Ising model (n=1) is the most common context for such a general question.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
