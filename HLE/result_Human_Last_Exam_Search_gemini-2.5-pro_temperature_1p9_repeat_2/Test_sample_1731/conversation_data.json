    "The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas) can be determined by leveraging the principles of large deviation theory, which provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the postulates of statistical mechanics.\n\n### The Connection: Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics\n\nThe core idea linking these fields is that the thermodynamic equilibrium state of a system corresponds to its most probable macroscopic state. Large deviation theory (LDT) quantifies the probability of rare events, specifically how the probability of an empirical measure (like the distribution of particles across energy levels) deviates from the true underlying distribution.\n\n*   **Sanov's Theorem:** This theorem is central to our analysis. It states that for a sequence of N independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, the probability that their empirical distribution `p` is close to some other distribution `q` (different from the true distribution `p₀`) decays exponentially with N. The rate of this decay is given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, or relative entropy, `D_KL(q || p₀)`. The most probable macrostate is the one that minimizes this rate function. In the context of statistical mechanics, where we often assume a uniform underlying measure, minimizing the KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the system under the given physical constraints.\n\n*   **Cramer's Theorem:** This theorem can be viewed as a specific application of Sanov's theorem that deals with the large deviations of the *empirical mean* of a set of random variables. In our case, it describes the probability of observing an average energy that is different from the equilibrium average energy. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes this deviation probability.\n\nUsing this framework, we can find the equilibrium distribution of photons by maximizing the system's entropy subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy.\n\n### Step 1: Deriving the Equilibrium Distribution\n\nFor a gas of bosons, like photons, the entropy `S` is a function of the average number of particles `n̄ᵢ` in each energy state `εᵢ`:\n`S = k_B Σᵢ [ (1 + n̄ᵢ) log(1 + n̄ᵢ) - n̄ᵢ log(n̄ᵢ) ]`\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant. This formula arises from counting the number of ways indistinguishable bosons can be placed in discrete energy states.\n\nTo find the equilibrium distribution, we maximize this entropy under the relevant constraints:\n1.  **Fixed Mean Energy:** The total average energy of the system is a constant, `⟨E⟩ = Σᵢ n̄ᵢ εᵢ`.\n2.  **No Particle Number Conservation:** Light quanta can be emitted and absorbed by the walls of their container. This means the total number of photons is not conserved. In the language of the grand canonical ensemble, this corresponds to a chemical potential `μ = 0`.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize `S` with the energy constraint. The Lagrange function is:\n`L = S/k_B - β (Σᵢ n̄ᵢ εᵢ - ⟨E⟩)`\nwhere `β` is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint.\n\nMaximizing with respect to `n̄ᵢ` by setting `∂L/∂n̄ᵢ = 0`:\n`∂/∂n̄ᵢ [ (1 + n̄ᵢ) log(1 + n̄ᵢ) - n̄ᵢ log(n̄ᵢ) ] - β εᵢ = 0`\n`log(1 + n̄ᵢ) - log(n̄ᵢ) = β εᵢ`\n`log( (1 + n̄ᵢ)/n̄ᵢ ) = β εᵢ`\n\nSolving for `n̄ᵢ` yields the celebrated **Bose-Einstein distribution** for photons:\n`n̄ᵢ = 1 / (exp(β εᵢ) - 1)`\nFrom thermodynamics, the Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified as `1 / (k_B T)`, where T is the equilibrium temperature.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe mean energy `⟨E⟩` is found by summing the energy of each state multiplied by its average occupation number. For a continuous spectrum of energies, we replace the sum with an integral over the density of states `g(ε)`. The energy of a photon is `ε = ħω`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `ω` is the angular frequency.\n\nThe density of states for photons in a volume `V`, considering two polarization states, is:\n`g(ω)dω = (Vω² / (π²c³)) dω`\n\nThe mean energy density `u = ⟨E⟩/V` is then given by the integral of the energy per mode multiplied by the density of states and the Bose-Einstein factor. This expression is precisely **Planck's law for black-body radiation**:\n`u(T) = ∫₀^∞ (ħω) * n̄(ω) * (g(ω)/V) dω = (1 / (π²c³)) ∫₀^∞ (ħω³) / (exp(ħω/k_B T) - 1) dω`\n\nEvaluating this integral yields the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**:\n`u(T) = (π²k_B⁴ / (15ħ³c³)) T⁴ = aT⁴`\nwhere `a` is the radiation constant. The total mean energy in a volume V is `⟨E⟩ = aVT⁴`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is found by substituting the derived Bose-Einstein distribution back into the entropy formula and converting the sum to an integral. The entropy per unit volume, `s = S/V`, is:\n`s(T) = (1/V) * k_B Σᵢ [ (1 + n̄ᵢ) log(1 + n̄ᵢ) - n̄ᵢ log(n̄ᵢ) ]`\n\nThis can be simplified and expressed as an integral:\n`s(T) = (k_B / (π²c³)) ∫₀^∞ ω² [ (1 + n̄(ω)) log(1 + n̄(ω)) - n̄(ω) log(n̄(ω)) ] dω`\n\nA more direct thermodynamic relation `S = (⟨E⟩ - F)/T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy, can be used. Integrating the Planck distribution leads to the final result for the entropy density:\n`s(T) = (4π²k_B⁴ / (45ħ³c³)) T³ = (4/3) aT³`\nThe total entropy in a volume V is `S = (4/3) aVT³`.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values for a gas of light quanta (photon gas) in a volume V at temperature T are:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (`⟨E⟩`):**\n    `⟨E⟩ = V * (π²k_B⁴ / (15ħ³c³)) T⁴`\n    This shows that the mean energy is proportional to `T⁴`.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (`S`):**\n    `S = V * (4π²k_B⁴ / (45ħ³c³)) T³`\n    This shows that the entropy is proportional to `T³`.>>>"
