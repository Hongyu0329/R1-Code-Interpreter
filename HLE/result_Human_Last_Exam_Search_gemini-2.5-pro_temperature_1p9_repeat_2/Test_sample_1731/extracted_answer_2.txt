The equilibrium values for a gas of light quanta (photon gas) in a volume V at temperature T are:

*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (`⟨E⟩`):**
    `⟨E⟩ = V * (π²k_B⁴ / (15ħ³c³)) T⁴`
    This shows that the mean energy is proportional to `T⁴`.

*   **Equilibrium Entropy (`S`):**
    `S = V * (4π²k_B⁴ / (45ħ³c³)) T³`
    This shows that the entropy is proportional to `T³`.
