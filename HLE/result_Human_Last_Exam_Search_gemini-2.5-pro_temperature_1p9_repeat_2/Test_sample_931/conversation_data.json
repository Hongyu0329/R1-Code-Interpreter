    "Based on the available information, adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) have a diet that is primarily predatory but can be supplemented with other foods.\n\nAdult snakeflies are well-documented predators, feeding on small, soft-bodied arthropods. Aphids are a very common prey item for them. Therefore, \"Totara Aphids\" (E) represents a known type of food for snakeflies.\n\nAdditionally, some sources report that adult snakeflies also feed on nectar. Pollen and other sugary substances like honeydew have also been found in their gut or are listed as food sources. This makes \"Nectar\" (A) a recorded food source as well.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that adult snakeflies feed on fungus or leaf tissue like Karamū leaf tissue (D).\n\nSince both nectar and aphids are recorded food sources for adult Raphidiopterans, the correct option is the one that includes both.\n\n<<<F>>>"
