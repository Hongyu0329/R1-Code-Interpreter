    "The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(G)$ of the group. For a group of type $E_8$, the Weyl group is denoted as $W(E_8)$. Consequently, the problem is reduced to determining the number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ was determined by R. W. Carter in his 1972 paper \"Conjugacy classes in the Weyl group\". As stated in a presentation on the conjugacy classes of the Lie group $E_8$, the number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group, denoted as â™¯cl(W), is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
