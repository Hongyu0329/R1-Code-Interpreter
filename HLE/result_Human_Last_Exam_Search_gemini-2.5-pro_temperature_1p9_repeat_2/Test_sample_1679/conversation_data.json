    "The first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was **An American in Paris**.\n\nThe 1951 musical, which won a total of six Academy Awards including Best Picture, features a lavish ballet sequence set to George Gershwin's composition of the same name. While the majority of the film was shot on soundstages at MGM Studios in Hollywood, this extended dance number showcases various Parisian landmarks.\n\nSpecifically, one of the stylized sets in the ballet was designed to represent the Place de la Concorde in Paris, the location of one of the two Luxor Obelisks. The centerpiece of this set was a fountain based on the one at the Place de la Concorde, and the overall design was inspired by the work of French painter Raoul Dufy. A model of the Place de la Concorde fountain was created and used by the production team to plan the choreography and filming of the scene.\n\nAlthough earlier films that won Best Picture were set in Europe, such as *Wings* (1927/28) and *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30), they do not feature depictions of the Luxor Obelisk. *An American in Paris* is the first film to hold this distinction.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
