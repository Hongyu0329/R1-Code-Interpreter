    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself, is **G**.\n\nThe basis for this is Newton's \"Opticks\" from 1704, where he created a circular diagram that mapped the colors of the visible spectrum to the notes of a musical scale. The scale he used was the Dorian mode, starting on the note D.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the correlation:\n*   **The Color Combination:** When the primary colors yellow and blue are mixed, they produce the secondary color green.\n*   **Newton's Color Spectrum and Musical Scale:** Newton associated the seven colors of the spectrum with the seven notes of the Dorian scale, starting with red as D.\n*   **Mapping the Notes:** In this system, the primary colors familiar to painters—red, yellow, and blue—correspond to the notes D, F, and A, respectively. The color green is situated between yellow and blue on the color wheel. The note between F and A in the D-Dorian scale (D, E, F, G, A, B, C) is G.\n*   **The Specific Range:** The question asks for the musical note for the range between green (the result of mixing yellow and blue) and blue. On Newton's color circle, the distinct color in this position is green, which is assigned the musical note G.\n\nTherefore, the color found between yellow and blue is green, which corresponds to the musical note G on Newton's color circle.\n\n<<<G>>>"
