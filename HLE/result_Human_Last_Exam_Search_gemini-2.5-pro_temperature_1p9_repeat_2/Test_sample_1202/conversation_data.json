    "After a gene duplication event in a eukaryotic genome, several outcomes are possible for the newly created gene copies. These potential fates determine whether the duplicated genes are retained and how they might diverge in function over evolutionary time.\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer that results in one DNA sequence replacing a homologous sequence, making them identical. While gene conversion can contribute to the retention of duplicate genes by homogenizing them and preventing the accumulation of deleterious mutations in one copy, its primary role is to reduce divergence, not create it, although it can sometimes generate novel gene variants.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for duplicate genes. It involves one copy of the gene accumulating mutations that render it non-functional. As this leads to the loss of a functional gene, it is a mechanism of non-retention, not retention.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this process, one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new function. This is a powerful mechanism for evolutionary innovation that leads to both the retention of the gene pair (as both original and new functions can be beneficial) and their divergence.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each gene copy accumulates mutations that inactivate different subfunctions. As a result, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of functions of the original ancestral gene. This partitioning of functions ensures the retention of both copies and represents a clear mode of divergence. Many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization a highly probable and common mechanism for the preservation of duplicate genes because it can occur through neutral or nearly neutral mutations, which are more common than the rare beneficial mutations required for neofunctionalization.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary process describing the rapid diversification of a single ancestral species into multiple new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. This concept operates at the level of species diversification, not at the level of individual gene retention and divergence within a genome.\n\nComparing the mechanisms, both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are established models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, subfunctionalization provides a neutral pathway for preservation, suggesting it might be a more common initial fate. The \"Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation\" (DDC) model, a cornerstone of subfunctionalization, posits that complementary loss-of-function mutations make both gene copies essential. This process of dividing the original labor is considered a highly likely mechanism for the long-term retention of duplicated genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
