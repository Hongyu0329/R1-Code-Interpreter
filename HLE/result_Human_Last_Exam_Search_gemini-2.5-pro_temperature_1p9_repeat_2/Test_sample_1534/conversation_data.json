    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Ascarosepion bandense*, formerly *Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily other lobes within the palliovisceral lobe complex.\n\nA detailed 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish reveals the spatial organization of its 38 brain lobes. The palliovisceral lobe (PV) is a part of the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is located in the subesophageal mass of the brain.\n\nThe brain regions situated posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe include:\n*   **Posterior chromatophore lobes (PC)**: These lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass. Their name indicates their posterior position.\n*   **Fin lobes (F)**: These lobes control the movement of the fins. Anatomical representations show them located in the posterior region of the brain.\n*   **Lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes (LPV)**: These are also part of the same complex and are located ventrally and laterally, with a posterior extension.\n*   **Dorsal and Ventral vasomotor lobes (DV, VV)**: These lobes are also part of the palliovisceral complex.\n\nThe posterior part of the subesophageal mass, which includes the palliovisceral lobe complex, projects towards the back of the animal to control motor actions in the more posterior parts of the body, such as escape movements and inking mediated by the funnel. The brain itself is encased on its posterior side by rigid cartilage.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent and posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are primarily other components of the palliovisceral lobe complex, including the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes.>>>"
