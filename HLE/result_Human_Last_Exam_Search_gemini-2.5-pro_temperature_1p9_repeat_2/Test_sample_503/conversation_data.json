    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of posets, requires finding the number of pairs of order-preserving maps that satisfy a specific adjoint relationship.\n\nThe objects in the simplex category are finite ordinals, denoted as $[n] = \\{0, 1, ..., n\\}$. The problem asks for adjunctions from $$ to $$. An adjunction consists of a pair of order-preserving (monotone) maps, a left adjoint $f: \\to$ and a right adjoint $g: \\to$, which satisfy the conditions:\n1.  $id_{} \\le g \\circ f$\n2.  $f \\circ g \\le id_{}$\n\nThese conditions are equivalent to stating that for any $i \\in$ and $j \\in$, the relationship $f(i) \\le j$ holds if and only if $i \\le g(j)$.\n\nA fundamental result in poset theory is that a monotone map between posets that are complete lattices is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema), and a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets (infima). The posets $[n]$ are finite linear orders, which are complete lattices.\n\nFor a monotone map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ between such chains, the preservation of non-empty joins is automatic. The only condition that needs to be explicitly checked is the preservation of the join of the empty set, which corresponds to the least element. This means $f$ must map the least element of $[n]$ to the least element of $[m]$. Thus, a monotone map $f: \\to$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, a monotone map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets. This boils down to the condition that $g$ must preserve the meet of the empty set, which corresponds to the greatest element. Thus, a monotone map $g: \\to$ is a right adjoint if and only if $g(37) = 23$.\n\nSince an adjunction is uniquely determined by its left adjoint, we can simply count the number of valid left adjoints. The task reduces to counting the number of monotone maps $f: \\to$ that satisfy the condition $f(0) = 0$.\n\nA monotone map is defined by the sequence of its values, so we need to count the number of sequences $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, with values chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing 23 values from a set of $38$ possible values (from 0 to 37) with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter as they will be arranged into a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$\nHere, $n=38$ is the number of values to choose from, and $k=23$ is the number of values we are choosing.\nThe number of such maps is $\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nCalculating the value of this binomial coefficient:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!}$\nThis evaluates to 60,355,683,101,847,680.\n\n<<<60355683101847680>>>"
