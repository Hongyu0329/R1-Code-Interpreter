    "When two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 are brought into lateral contact with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the junction is 0.\n\nThe number of topologically protected chiral edge states at the interface between two Chern insulators is determined by the difference between their individual Chern numbers. In this case, both insulators have a Chern number of 1. Therefore, the difference is |1 - 1| = 0. This implies that no new conducting channels are formed at the junction.\n\nWhile each individual Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1 hosts a single chiral edge state on its own boundaries, at the interface where they meet, there are no topologically protected conducting states. This is a consequence of the bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates the change in the topological invariant (the Chern number) across a boundary to the number of localized states on that boundary. Since there is no change in the Chern number across the junction, no edge states are expected to appear there.\n\n<<<0>>>"
