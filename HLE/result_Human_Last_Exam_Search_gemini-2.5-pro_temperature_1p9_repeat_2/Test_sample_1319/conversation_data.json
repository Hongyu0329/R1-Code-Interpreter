    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Ida, located in modern-day Turkey, near the ancient city of Troy. Its highest peak reaches an elevation of 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n\nIn Homer's epic poem, Mount Ida is a significant location from which the gods would observe the Trojan War. It was also the setting for several mythological events, including the judgment of Paris and Zeus's seduction of Hera. The mountain is described as \"many-fountained\" and a source of rivers.\n\nAnother prominent mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Saos, on the island of Samothrace, also known by its modern name Fengari. From its peak, Poseidon is said to have watched the unfolding battles of the Trojan War. Mount Saos stands at an elevation of 1,611 meters (5,285 feet), making it lower than Mount Ida.\n\nTherefore, with an elevation of 1,774 meters, Mount Ida is the taller of the two.\n\n<<<Mount Ida>>>"
