    "Yes, it does follow that $f=0$. Here is a step-by-step argument.\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a function in the Schwartz space, denoted $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$. This means that $f$ is a smooth (infinitely differentiable) function that, along with all its derivatives, decays faster than the inverse of any polynomial.\n\nThe problem states that all the moments of $f$ are zero:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all non-negative integers } k=0, 1, 2, \\ldots $$\n\nWe will analyze this condition using the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform is an isomorphism (a structure-preserving bijection) from the Schwartz space onto itself. The Fourier transform of $f$, denoted by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, is defined as:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\n\n**1. Differentiating the Fourier Transform**\nBecause $f$ is a Schwartz function, we can differentiate under the integral sign. The $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is given by:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\n\n**2. Connecting Moments to Derivatives of the Fourier Transform**\nLet's evaluate these derivatives at the origin, $\\xi=0$:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) \\,dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx $$\nUsing the given condition that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$, we find:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots $$\nThis means that the Fourier transform of $f$, and all of its derivatives, are zero at the origin.\n\n**3. Properties of the Fourier Transform of a Schwartz Function**\nSince $f$ is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function. A crucial property that goes beyond this is that $\\hat{f}$ can be extended to an entire function on the complex plane (a function that is holomorphic everywhere). An entire function that has a Taylor series with all coefficients equal to zero about a point must be identically zero everywhere.\n\nSince we have shown that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\geq 0$, the Taylor series for $\\hat{f}$ around $\\xi=0$ is identically zero. Because $\\hat{f}$ is analytic, it must be equal to its Taylor series, which implies:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R} $$\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe Fourier transform is a bijective map on the Schwartz space. This means that if the transform of a function is the zero function, the original function must also have been the zero function. This can be seen by applying the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$ f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,d\\xi = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,d\\xi = 0 $$\nTherefore, it follows that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
