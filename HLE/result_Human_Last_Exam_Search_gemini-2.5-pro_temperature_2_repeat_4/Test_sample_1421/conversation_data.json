    "The formula for the fermionic partition function, Z, in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields.\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as:\n\n```\nZ = ∫ D(ψ̄) D(ψ) exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n*   **ψ(τ, x)** and **ψ̄(τ, x)** are the fermionic fields, which are represented by **Grassmann numbers**. These are anti-commuting variables, meaning they satisfy {ψₐ, ψₑ} = ψₐψₑ + ψₑψₐ = 0. This property is essential to correctly incorporate the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions.\n*   **D(ψ̄) D(ψ)** represents the functional integration measure over all possible configurations of the Grassmann fields.\n*   **S_E[ψ̄, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the system, derived from the standard action by a Wick rotation to imaginary time (t → -iτ).\n*   The integral is performed over fermionic fields that are **anti-periodic** in the imaginary time direction τ, with a period of β = 1/(kₛT), where T is the temperature and kₛ is the Boltzmann constant. This anti-periodic boundary condition is a direct consequence of the fermionic statistics and is expressed as:\n    `ψ(τ + β, x) = -ψ(τ, x)`\n    `ψ̄(τ + β, x) = -ψ̄(τ, x)`\n\nFor a general non-interacting fermion system described by a single-particle Hamiltonian Ĥ, the Euclidean action S_E takes the form:\n\n```\nS_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̄(τ, x) (ħ∂/∂τ + Ĥ) ψ(τ, x)\n```\n\nHere:\n\n*   **τ** is the imaginary time, which is integrated from 0 to β.\n*   **x** represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Ĥ** is the Hamiltonian operator, for instance, for non-relativistic free fermions it could be Ĥ = - (ħ²/2m)∇² - µ, where m is the mass and µ is the chemical potential.\n\nThis path integral formalism provides a powerful framework in quantum statistical mechanics and many-body theory to compute thermodynamic properties of fermionic systems.\n\n<<<\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function (Z) in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by:\n$Z = \\int_{\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)}^{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi}\\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\nWhere:\n<ul>\n  <li>$\\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi}\\mathcal{D}\\psi$ is the functional integration measure over all configurations of the anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$.</li>\n  <li>The integral is subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction: $\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\beta) = -\\bar{\\psi}(0)$, where $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature.</li>\n  <li>$S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system.
