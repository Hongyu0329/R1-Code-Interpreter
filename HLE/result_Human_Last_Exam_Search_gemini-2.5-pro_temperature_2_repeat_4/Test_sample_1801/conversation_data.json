    "The two Nobel laureates connected to Enron's infamous \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign in 2000 were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Paul Krugman.\n\nPhysicist and Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann was featured in an Enron commercial titled \"Metalman\" as part of the \"Ask Why\" campaign. Gell-Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles. In the Enron commercial, he speaks about the importance of questioning existing ideas to make progress.\n\nEconomist Paul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, was not in a commercial but was a paid member of an Enron advisory board in 1999. This advisory board was tasked with providing Enron executives with briefings on economic and political issues. Krugman has stated he was paid $37,500 for his participation.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Murray Gell-Mann>>>"
