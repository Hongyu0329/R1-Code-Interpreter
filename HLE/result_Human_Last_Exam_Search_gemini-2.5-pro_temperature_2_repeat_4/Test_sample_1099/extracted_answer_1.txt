The minimal resources to simulate the correlations from a set of POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state using a local hidden variable model are, on average:
*   **Option 1 (Communication only):** Approximately 6.38 bits of classical communication without the use of any PR-boxes. For the simpler case of only projective measurements, this reduces to 1 bit of communication.
*   **Option 2 (PR-box only):** One non-signaling PR-box without any classical communication.
There exists a trade-off between these two resources.
