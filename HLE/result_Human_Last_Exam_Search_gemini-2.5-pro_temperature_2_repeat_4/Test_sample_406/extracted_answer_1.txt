The conditions for the functions F: X*Y*Z→X, G: Y*X*Y→Y, and H: Z*Y*X→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are primarily established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet (x, y, z) from X × Y × Z satisfying F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The main conditions are as follows:

1.  **Setting:** (X, ≤<sub>X</sub>, d<sub>X</sub>), (Y, ≤<sub>Y</sub>, d<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, ≤<sub>Z</sub>, d<sub>Z</sub>) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces.

2.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H need to satisfy a mixed monotone property, meaning they are non-decreasing in some arguments and non-increasing in others, in a way that is compatible with the iterative process used to find the fixed point. Specifically, F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in the second; G is non-increasing in its first and third arguments and non-decreasing in the second; and H is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in the second.

3.  **Contractive Condition:** There must be a contractive condition on the functions. This usually takes the form of an inequality that bounds the distance between the images of two sets of points by a linear combination of the distances between the original points, with coefficients that sum to less than 1. This ensures that successive iterations of the functions bring points closer together.

4.  **Initial Point Condition:** There must exist an initial set of points (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies a specific order relationship with its image under the functions, such as x₀ ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z₀, y₀, x₀).

5.  **Continuity or Regularity:** Either the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the partially ordered metric spaces possess a regularity property. This property ensures that if a monotone sequence converges to a limit, the terms of the sequence are related to the limit in the expected way by the partial order.

For the fixed point to be unique, an additional condition of comparability is often required, stating that for any two triplets of points, there exists a third triplet that is comparable to both.
