    "Pure phosphorus can be observed in four distinct colors based on its different solid allotropes. These allotropes exhibit unique colors and properties. The primary colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are white, red, black, and violet.\n\nThe main allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors are:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This is the most common and reactive allotrope of phosphorus. It is a waxy and translucent solid that, when pure, is white. Upon exposure to light or due to the presence of impurities, white phosphorus can appear yellow, and is therefore sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is more stable than white phosphorus and is commonly used on the striking surface of matchboxes. Red phosphorus has a deep red color. Some forms of red phosphorus can also have an iron-grey luster.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable and least reactive form of phosphorus. It has a layered, graphite-like structure and is black and flaky in appearance.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline allotrope. As its name suggests, it is violet in color, and can also be described as red/purple.\n\nAnother allotrope, known as blue phosphorus, has been synthesized, but typically as a single layer (a two-dimensional material) and not as a bulk solid. Additionally, white phosphorus can glow with a greenish-blue light in the dark, but this is due to a chemical reaction with oxygen (chemiluminescence), not the intrinsic color of the allotrope.\n\nTherefore, counting the distinct, observable colors of the common solid allotropes, there are four: white, red, black, and violet.\n\n<<<4>>>"
