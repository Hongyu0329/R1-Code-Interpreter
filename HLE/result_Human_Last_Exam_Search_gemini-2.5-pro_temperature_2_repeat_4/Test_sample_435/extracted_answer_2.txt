CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a more robust and potent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to those manufactured without it. This is expected to lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity but also a higher potential for cytokine release syndrome.
