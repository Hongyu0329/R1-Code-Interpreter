    "A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center. This is a classic Chinese character riddle that describes the character **高** (gāo).\n\nThe structure of the character can be broken down to match the riddle's description:\n\n*   **\"A wooden stick\"** refers to the horizontal stroke at the very top (一).\n*   **\"Hanging a square box\"** refers to the component directly below the top stroke (口).\n*   **\"A ladder placed in the center\"** refers to the lower part of the character (冂 with another 口 inside), which resembles a ladder.\n\n<<<高>>>"
