    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is determined by the structure of its Weyl group. The $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(G)$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, regardless of whether the group $G$ is split or not. Consequently, the so-called \"twisted\" conjugacy classes in the Weyl group are the same as the ordinary conjugacy classes.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted as $W(E_8)$. According to the classification of conjugacy classes in Weyl groups, which was notably computed by R. Carter, the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has exactly 112 conjugacy classes.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$, up to conjugacy by elements of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
