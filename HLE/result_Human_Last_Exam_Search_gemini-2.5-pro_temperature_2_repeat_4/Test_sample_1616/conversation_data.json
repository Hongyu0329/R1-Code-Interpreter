    "Based on an analysis of its sound development, **shadow** has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense (long) vowel or diphthong becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each word:\n*   **southern**: This word is an example of trisyllabic laxing. The vowel in `south` (/saʊθ/) is a diphthong, while the vowel in `southern` (/ˈsʌðərn/) is lax. This change occurred when the word was pronounced with three syllables in its earlier form (*southerne*).\n*   **derivative**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing when compared to its root word `derive`. The diphthong /aɪ/ in `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/) becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the antepenultimate syllable of `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/).\n*   **serenity**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /iː/ in `serene` (/səˈriːn/) becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in the antepenultimate syllable of `serenity` (/səˈrɛnəti/).\n*   **pleasant**: This word is disyllabic and therefore the rule of trisyllabic laxing, which applies to words of three or more syllables, is not applicable. It is derived from Old French *plaisant*.\n*   **gratitude**: This word also underwent trisyllabic laxing. It can be compared with `grateful`. The diphthong /eɪ/ in `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfəl/) becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in the antepenultimate syllable of `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/).\n*   **shadow**: While the vowel in `shadow` is lax compared to the tense vowel in `shade`, this change is due to a different process. Sources identify the vowel shortening in the pair `shade`/`shadow` as an example of **disyllabic laxing**, not trisyllabic laxing. The word `shadow` has only two syllables and thus does not meet the criteria for the trisyllabic laxing rule.\n\nBoth `pleasant` and `shadow` are disyllabic words and therefore did not undergo trisyllabic laxing. However, `shadow` is explicitly cited as an example of a separate phonological rule known as disyllabic laxing, making it a distinct case from the trisyllabic process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
