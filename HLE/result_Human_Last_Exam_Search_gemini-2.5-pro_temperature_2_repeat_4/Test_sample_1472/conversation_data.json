    "The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The two most common forms are the copper(I) and copper(II) complexes, which have different molecular geometries and therefore different point groups.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)**: In this complex, the copper(I) ion is coordinated to four sulfur atoms from two bis(2,5-dithiahexane) ligands, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry. The point group for the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation is **S₄**. This is due to the presence of a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄), where the molecule is rotated by 90 degrees and then reflected through a plane perpendicular to the axis, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)**: The copper(II) complex exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry. The four sulfur atoms from the two ligands form a square planar arrangement around the copper ion, with two anions, such as perchlorate or tetrafluoroborate, coordinated in the axial positions. This distortion from a perfect octahedron is expected due to the Jahn-Teller effect for a d⁹ metal ion like copper(II). The crystal structure of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) bis(tetrafluoroborate) has a P2₁/c space group, which indicates the presence of an inversion center. Therefore, the point group of the distorted octahedral [Cu(bis(2,5-dithiahexane))₂]²⁺ cation is likely **Cᵢ**, possessing only an inversion center, or **C₂ₕ** if a two-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane are also present, depending on the exact conformation of the chelate rings. Given the distortion and the crystal packing, a low symmetry point group is expected.\n\nIn summary, the symmetry point group is **S₄** for the copper(I) complex and a lower symmetry group such as **Cᵢ** or **C₂ₕ** for the copper(II) complex.\n\n<<<S₄ for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) and Cᵢ or C₂ₕ for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)>>>"
