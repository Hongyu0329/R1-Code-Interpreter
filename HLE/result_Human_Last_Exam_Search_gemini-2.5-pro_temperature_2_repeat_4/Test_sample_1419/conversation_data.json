    "In the vicinity of four dimensions, specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the quantum field theory of a single scalar field with a φ⁴ interaction possesses a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The location of this fixed point in the space of coupling constants determines the critical behavior of the theory. To find the leading order expression for this fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, one examines the renormalization group (RG) flow of the coupling constant, which is governed by the beta function, β(u).\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling constant *u* in ϕ⁴ theory is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + Bu²\n\nHere, ϵ = 4 - d is a small positive parameter, and B is a positive constant that arises from the loop integration. The specific value of B depends on the renormalization scheme and conventions used, but for the leading order result in ϵ, its precise value is not necessary.\n\nA fixed point, u*, is a value of the coupling where the theory is scale-invariant, meaning the beta function vanishes: β(u*) = 0. Setting the one-loop beta function to zero yields two solutions:\n\n-ϵu* + B(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation gives two fixed points:\n\n1.  The Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0, which corresponds to a free, non-interacting theory.\n2.  The non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is found by solving for the non-zero value of u*.\n\nFactoring out u* from the equation gives:\n\nu*(-ϵ + Bu*) = 0\n\nThe non-trivial solution is:\n\n-ϵ + Bu* = 0\n\nSolving for u* gives:\n\nu* = ϵ / B\n\nThis expression shows that, to leading order, the fixed point coupling u* is directly proportional to ϵ. This result is a cornerstone of the epsilon expansion, which allows for perturbative calculations of critical exponents near four dimensions.\n\n<<<u* = ϵ / B>>>"
