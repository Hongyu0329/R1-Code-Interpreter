    "### Equilibrium State of Photon Gas from Large Deviation Principles\n\nThe equilibrium values for the entropy and mean energy of a photon gas (Bose case of light quanta) can be determined using the principles of maximum entropy, which are rigorously justified by large deviation theorems such as the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems establish that the overwhelming majority of microscopic states compatible with a given macroscopic constraint (like total energy) correspond to the state of maximum entropy. This maximum entropy state is the equilibrium state of the system.\n\n**Conceptual Framework: Large Deviation Theorems**\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem connects the probability of observing an empirical distribution of particles among energy levels that deviates from a reference distribution to the relative entropy between them. The most probable distribution, and thus the equilibrium state, is the one that minimizes this relative entropy. This minimization under a constant mean energy constraint is equivalent to the principle of maximizing the Boltzmann entropy (S = k_B ln W).\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem quantifies the probability of the empirical mean of a set of random variables (like the energy of individual photons) deviating from its expected value. It implies that for a large system, observing a mean energy different from the one corresponding to the maximum entropy state is exponentially unlikely. This provides a foundation for the stability of the equilibrium mean energy value.\n\nTo find the equilibrium values, we maximize the entropy for a gas of bosons (photons) subject to the constraint of a constant total mean energy. A crucial characteristic of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (like black-body radiation) is that the number of photons is not conserved, which implies that their chemical potential is zero.\n\n### Equilibrium Distribution: Bose-Einstein Statistics\n\nThe process of maximizing the statistical entropy for indistinguishable bosons under a fixed total energy constraint yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average number of photons, `<n(ε)>`, in a quantum state with energy ε = hν:\n\n`<n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε / k_B T) - 1)`\n\nHere, `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature. This distribution function is fundamental to describing the properties of the photon gas at equilibrium.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe total mean energy, `U`, of the photon gas is obtained by integrating the product of the energy per state (ε), the density of states `g(ε)`, and the average occupation number `<n(ε)>` over all possible energies. For a photon gas in a volume `V`, the density of states (including two polarization states) is `g(ε) = (8πV / (h³c³))ε²`.\n\nThe integration yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy:\n\n`U = ∫₀^∞ ε * g(ε) * <n(ε)> dε = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴`\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe entropy, `S`, of the photon gas at equilibrium can be calculated using thermodynamic relations derived from the system's partition function or directly from the statistical definition of entropy for a boson gas. The calculation results in the following expression:\n\n`S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³`\n\nThis result can also be expressed in terms of the mean energy `U` as:\n\n`S = (4/3) * (U/T)`\n\nThus, the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas is proportional to the volume and the third power of the absolute temperature.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\nThe equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴`\nwhere:\n*   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant\n*   `h` is the Planck constant\n*   `c` is the speed of light\n*   `V` is the volume\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\nThe equilibrium entropy of the photon gas is:\n`S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³`\nThis can also be written in relation to the mean energy as `S = (4/3) * U / T`."
