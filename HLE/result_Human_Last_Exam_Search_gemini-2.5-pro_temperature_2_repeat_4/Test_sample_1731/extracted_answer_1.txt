**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**
The equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
`U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴`
where:
*   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant
*   `h` is the Planck constant
*   `c` is the speed of light
*   `V` is the volume
*   `T` is the absolute temperature

**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**
The equilibrium entropy of the photon gas is:
`S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³`
This can also be written in relation to the mean energy as `S = (4/3) * U / T`.
