    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of quantum systems before interactions are taken into account.\n\nThe bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, G₀(k, ω), for a non-interacting system is typically expressed as:\n\n***\n\nG₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)\n\n***\n\nHere's a breakdown of the components and their significance:\n\n*   **ω:** Represents the frequency or energy of the particle.\n*   **k:** Denotes the momentum of the particle.\n*   **ϵ_k:** This is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a particle with momentum k. It represents the energy of a particle in a specific quantum state in the absence of interactions.\n*   **iη:** This is an infinitesimally small complex term. The sign of η (either positive or negative) determines the specific type of Green's function (retarded, advanced, or causal/time-ordered). For the time-ordered Green's function, commonly used in many-body theory, the expression is more precisely written as:\n\n    G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ))\n\n    where μ is the chemical potential and sgn is the signum function. This ensures that particles propagate forward in time above the Fermi level (ϵ_k > μ) and holes (the absence of particles) propagate forward in time below the Fermi level (ϵ_k < μ).\n\n**Functional Dependence:**\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is that of an **inverse linear relationship with respect to the difference between the energy variable ω and the eigenvalue ϵ_k**. This relationship gives rise to a crucial feature: the bare Green's function has poles (divergences) at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. Physically, these poles indicate the energies at which a single, non-interacting particle can exist and propagate through the system.\n\n**Derivation within the Path Integral Formalism:**\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, Green's functions are calculated as correlation functions. For a non-interacting system, the action in the path integral is quadratic in the fields. The bare Green's function is essentially the inverse of the operator that appears in this quadratic action. When the action is expressed in frequency-momentum space, this operator becomes a simple algebraic expression involving ω and the single-particle Hamiltonian, whose eigenvalues are ϵ_k. The inversion of this expression directly leads to the form of G₀(k, ω) shown above.\n\nIn summary, the bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k.\n\n<<<Inversely proportional to the difference between the energy (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k), typically expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη).>>>"
