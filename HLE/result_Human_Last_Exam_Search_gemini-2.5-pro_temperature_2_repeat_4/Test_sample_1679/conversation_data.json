    "**An American in Paris**, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor to feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk. The iconic Parisian landmark appears in a stylized form during the film's celebrated 17-minute ballet sequence.\n\nThe film, directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, showcases a dream-like version of Paris. The ballet's opening scene is set in a plaza featuring a prominent fountain that is explicitly based on the fountains of the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is located. This elaborate set was designed in the style of French Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy. Furthermore, a reference in a book about the film indicates that the Obelisk itself is visible during the movie's opening sequence.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners were filmed in or featured Paris, research and analysis of earlier winning films show no evidence of the Luxor Obelisk being depicted on-screen prior to *An American in Paris*. The film's artistic and romanticized vision of the French capital solidified its place in cinematic history, not only for its musical and dance numbers but also for its imaginative portrayal of Parisian landmarks.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
