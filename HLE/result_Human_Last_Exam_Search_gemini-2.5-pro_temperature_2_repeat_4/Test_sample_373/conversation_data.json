    "To determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph, we must first understand the graph's structure and the nature of the sampling process.\n\n### Barbell Graph Structure\n\nA barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge, known as a bridge or bottleneck edge. For a barbell graph with 10 total nodes, the most common configuration consists of two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (`K₅`), joined by the bottleneck edge.\n\n### Calculating the Total Number of Edges\n\nThe total number of edges in the graph is the sum of the edges in both cliques plus the one bottleneck edge. The number of edges in a complete graph with *n* nodes is given by the formula n * (n-1) / 2.\n\n*   **Edges in one K₅ clique:** (5 * (5-1)) / 2 = 10 edges.\n*   **Total edges in both cliques:** 10 + 10 = 20 edges.\n*   **Bottleneck edge:** 1 edge.\n\nTherefore, the total number of edges in a 10-node barbell graph is 20 + 1 = 21.\n\n### Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\n\"Randomized uniform gossiping\" implies a process where an edge is selected uniformly at random from the set of all available edges in the graph. This means every edge has an equal probability of being chosen.\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n*   **Favorable outcomes (sampling the bottleneck edge):** 1\n*   **Total possible outcomes (total number of edges):** 21\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is therefore 1 out of 21.\n\n<<<The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/21.>>>"
