    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" (Der Radionist) by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museums of Berlin) in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther. The painting is part of the collection of the Nationalgalerie (National Gallery), which is one of the institutions under the umbrella of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\n\n\"The Radionist,\" also known as \"Radio Enthusiast\" or \"Petty Bourgeois on the Radio,\" is a significant work from the New Objectivity movement in Germany. It depicts a man, identified as a certain Mr. Schreck who was a paraplegic and lived in Günther's house, listening to the radio. The painting is seen as a commentary on the burgeoning radio culture of the Weimar Republic.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin"
