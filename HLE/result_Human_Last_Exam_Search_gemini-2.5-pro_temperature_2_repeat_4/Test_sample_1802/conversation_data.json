    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that acts on a d-dimensional qudit density matrix is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n1.  **Quantum Channels and Kraus Operators:** A quantum channel $\\Lambda$ describes the evolution of a quantum state. It can be represented by a set of \"Kraus operators\" $\\{A_k\\}$ that act on the state's density matrix $\\rho$ as follows:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_k A_k \\rho A_k^\\dagger$\n    The condition $\\sum_k A_k^\\dagger A_k = I$ ensures that the trace of the density matrix remains 1.\n\n2.  **Pauli Channels:** For a qudit in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which we denote as $\\{P_i\\}_{i=0}^{d^2-1}$. These operators are unitary and form a complete basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices. A Pauli channel is defined by applying these Pauli operators with certain probabilities $p_i$:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} p_i P_i \\rho P_i^\\dagger$\n    From this, we can identify the Kraus operators as $A_i = \\sqrt{p_i} P_i$.\n\n3.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank:** The complementary channel, denoted as $\\Lambda^c$, describes the information that \"leaks\" into the environment during the channel's operation. The rank of the complementary channel is a fundamental property. It is defined as the dimension of the operator space spanned by all possible products of the original channel's Kraus operators, $A_i^\\dagger A_j$. Mathematically:\n    Rank($\\Lambda^c$) = dim(span{$\\{A_i^\\dagger A_j\\}$})\n\n4.  **Calculating the Rank for a Pauli Channel:** For a Pauli channel, the operators spanning this space are:\n    $A_i^\\dagger A_j = (\\sqrt{p_i} P_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} P_j) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} P_i^\\dagger P_j$\n\n5.  **Maximizing the Rank:** To find the *maximal* possible rank, we can choose the probabilities $p_i$ freely. To get the largest possible spanning set, we can choose a channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero (i.e., $p_i > 0$ for all $i$). A common example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_i = 1/d^2$ for all $i$. In this case, we need to find the dimension of the space spanned by all the products $\\{P_i^\\dagger P_j\\}$.\n\n6.  **The Basis of Pauli Operators:** The set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $\\{P_k\\}$ forms a basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices. This means any $d \\times d$ matrix can be written as a linear combination of these Pauli operators. The dimension of this space is $d^2$.\n\n7.  **Spanning the Full Space:** Let's examine the set of operators $\\{P_i^\\dagger P_j\\}$. The Pauli operators include the identity matrix, usually denoted as $P_0 = I$. If we fix the index $i=0$, we get the set $\\{P_0^\\dagger P_j\\} = \\{I^\\dagger P_j\\} = \\{P_j\\}$ for $j=0, ..., d^2-1$. This subset of the spanning operators is the complete set of Pauli operators, which, as stated before, already forms a basis for the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n\nTherefore, the linear span of all products $\\{P_i^\\dagger P_j\\}$ is the full space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The dimension of this space is $d^2$. Since we found a specific Pauli channel (the depolarizing channel) for which this maximum is achieved, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
