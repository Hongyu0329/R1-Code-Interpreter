    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear ruthenium complex is formed, which results in the creation of two diastereoisomers.\n\nThe reaction involves two equivalents of the ruthenium complex reacting with the bridging ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole. The resulting dinuclear complex can exist in two different stereoisomeric forms.\n\nThese two isomers are:\n*   A meso (Δ/Λ) form, which has a center of inversion.\n*   A racemic (rac) form, which consists of two enantiomers (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ) and possesses a two-fold rotation axis.\n\nThese two diastereomers can be separated from each other using techniques like cation exchange chromatography. The formation of these isomers has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography and 1H NMR spectroscopy.\n\n<<<2>>>"
