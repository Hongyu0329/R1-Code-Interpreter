    "The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is 9.\n\nThis is a specific instance of a general result in homotopy theory concerning a map related to the James-Hopf invariant. The map can be constructed in the context of the Hilton-Milnor theorem or the EHP sequence.\n\nA theorem by G. W. Whitehead establishes the connectivity for the general case. For spheres $S^p$ and $S^q$, the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q) \\to \\Omega(S^p \\wedge S^q)$ is $(p+q-1)$-connected.\n\nIn this particular problem, we have $p=4$ and $q=6$. Therefore, the connectivity is $4 + 6 - 1 = 9$.\n\nA map is defined as *k*-connected if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $\\pi_k$. In this case, the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < 9$ and a surjection on $\\pi_9$. The source and target spaces are both 8-connected, meaning their homotopy groups up to dimension 8 are trivial, so the isomorphism condition for $i < 9$ is trivially satisfied. The first non-trivial homotopy group for both spaces occurs at dimension 9, where the map induces a surjection between them.\n\n<<<9>>>"
