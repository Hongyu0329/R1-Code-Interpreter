    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The system is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe restrict our analysis to the upper half-plane, where $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points:**\n\nWe set $u'(t)=0$ and $d'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis:**\n\nWe analyze the stability of these points using the Jacobian matrix:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since both are positive, (0, 1) is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. With one positive and one negative eigenvalue, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so linearization fails.\n\n**3. Identifying the Separatrix:**\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Such curves are often the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. The saddle point of this system is (-1, 1).\n\nWe test for a solution of the form $d = -u^2$ in the phase plane equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$.\nThe derivative of this curve with respect to $u$ is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\n\nSubstituting $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the system's phase plane equation:\n$$ \\frac{2d^2+(-3u+5u^2)d-u^3(1-u)}{(u-1)u^2} = \\frac{2(-u^2)^2+(-3u+5u^2)(-u^2)+u^4-u^3}{u^3-u^2} $$\n$$ = \\frac{2u^4+3u^3-5u^4+u^4-u^3}{u^3-u^2} = \\frac{-2u^4+2u^3}{u^3-u^2} = \\frac{-2u^2(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u $$\nSince both sides are equal, $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution trajectory of the system.\n\nThis curve passes through the equilibrium points:\n*   If $u=0$, then $d=-(0)^2=0$, passing through (0, 0).\n*   If $u=1$, then $d=-(1)^2=-1$, passing through the saddle point (-1, 1).\n\nAn orbit that passes through a saddle point constitutes its stable or unstable manifold and is a separatrix. To determine which manifold it is, we look at the slope at the saddle point. The slope of the curve $d = -u^2$ at $u=1$ is $-2(1) = -2$. The eigenvector for the unstable manifold (with eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$) of the Jacobian at (-1, 1) corresponds to a slope of -2. Therefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThe stable manifold of the saddle point is along the line $u=1$, which separates trajectories based on whether $u(t)$ tends to 0 or to infinity. Both the line $u=1$ and the curve $d=-u^2$ act as separatrices. However, the curve connecting equilibrium points is often referred to as \"the\" separatrix in such problems.\n\nThus, the separatrix is given by the equation of this specific trajectory.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
