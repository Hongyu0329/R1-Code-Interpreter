    "A distinct difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. This distinction stems from the core principles of each ballet technique.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, which emphasizes a strong and stable core, the torso and hips are expected to remain square, even during a backbend. This technique prioritizes maintaining the body's classical alignment, with the backbend originating from the upper and middle spine while the hips stay firmly in place. This approach ensures that the movement is controlled and supported by the back muscles without distorting the foundational placement of the hips and shoulders. The Vaganova method features codified *port de bras* (carriage of the arms) and specific head positions that are coordinated with the movement of the upper body.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for its speed, athleticism, and the creation of long, extended lines. A signature characteristic of the Balanchine style is the willingness to deviate from a strictly square torso to achieve a desired aesthetic. While this is most famously seen in the arabesque, where the hip of the working leg is allowed to lift and open toward the audience to create the illusion of a longer line, this principle can be applied to other movements. This approach favors the visual effect of the line over the maintenance of a rigid, box-like torso. Therefore, in a Balanchine-style cambré derrière, there is often a visible change in the hip alignment to accentuate the curve of the body and the length of the limbs. The arms in the Balanchine method also have a distinct style, often more open and sometimes with flexed wrists, compared to the rounded, classical lines of Vaganova.\n\nWhile there are also differences in the speed of movement and arm styling, the fundamental approach to hip placement represents a core technical and philosophical distinction between the two methods when executing a cambré derrière.\n\n<<<B>>>"
