    "There are four crystal classes that are achiral and non-polar, but still possess the necessary symmetry to be optically active. Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. While this phenomenon is most commonly associated with chiral structures, these specific achiral classes permit it.\n\nThe four crystal classes are:\n*   m (also known by the Sch√∂nflies notation C_s)\n*   mm2 (also known as C_2v)\n*   4 (also known as S_4)\n*   42m (also known as D_2d)\n\nA crystal must lack a center of symmetry for optical activity to occur. While chirality, the property of being non-superimposable on one's mirror image, is the most common reason for a lack of a center of symmetry, it is not the only one. The aforementioned crystal classes are achiral because they possess roto-inversion axes (such as a mirror plane), which makes them superimposable on their mirror image. However, they still allow for optical activity. Natural optical activity has been observed in single crystals belonging to these four classes.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are m, mm2, 4, and 42m.>>>"
