The value is not a single number, but a set of defining rules for the Berezin integral. The integral of a Grassmann variable itself is normalized to one (∫dη η = 1), which corresponds to an occupied state, while the integral of a constant is zero (∫dη c = 0). This, combined with the property that Grassmann variables square to zero, enforces the Pauli exclusion principle.
