    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms. This is based on the structure of a known flexible nanocar and the chemical definition of a perfluorinated compound.\n\nA nanocar is a molecule designed to function as a molecular-scale vehicle. Several designs for nanocars exist, often featuring a chassis and four wheel-like structures. One specific model of a flexible nanocar has the chemical formula C310H34.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" or \"perfluorinated\" describes an organic compound where all hydrogen atoms attached to carbon have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, to determine the composition of a \"perfluoronanocar,\" the hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar structure are substituted with fluorine atoms.\n\nApplying this to the flexible nanocar model with the formula C310H34, a perfluorinated version would have the formula C310F34. This means that the 34 hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar molecule would be replaced by 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
