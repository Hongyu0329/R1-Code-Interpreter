    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\nThe given functions are:\n*   **Supply:** $P = \\ln(Q^3 - 2)$\n*   **Demand:** $P = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$\n\n**1. Market Equilibrium**\n\nAt equilibrium, the price and quantity are the same for both supply and demand. Therefore, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n$\\ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$\n\nThis is a transcendental equation, and solving it for the equilibrium quantity ($Q_E$) requires numerical methods. By using computational tools, we find that:\n*   Equilibrium Quantity ($Q_E$) ≈ 4.6983\n*   Equilibrium Price ($P_E$) can be found by substituting $Q_E$ into either equation. Using the demand function: $P_E = 18e^{-\\arctan(4.6983)}$ ≈ 4.6218\n\n**2. Total Welfare**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It can be calculated by integrating the area between the demand and supply curves.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price. The formula is:\n    $CS = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} D(Q) dQ - (P_E \\times Q_E)$\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. The formula is:\n    $PS = (P_E \\times Q_E) - \\int_{Q_{start}}^{Q_E} S(Q) dQ$\n    The integration for the supply curve starts from the quantity where the price becomes non-negative. For the supply function $P = \\ln(Q^3 - 2)$, the price is zero when $Q^3-2=1$, so $Q = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.4422$.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nTotal welfare (TW) is the sum of consumer and producer surplus, which simplifies to the total area between the demand curve (from Q=0) and the supply curve (from its starting point) up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n$TW = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} D(Q) dQ - \\int_{\\sqrt{3}}^{Q_E} S(Q) dQ$\n\nUsing numerical integration for the complex functions involved:\n*   The integral of the demand curve from 0 to 4.6983 is:\n    $\\int_{0}^{4.6983} 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} dQ \\approx 32.7483$\n*   The integral of the supply curve from $\\sqrt{3}$ to 4.6983 is:\n    $\\int_{1.4422}^{4.6983} \\ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ \\approx 11.0850$\n\nTotal Welfare is the difference between these two values:\n$TW \\approx 32.7483 - 11.0850 = 21.6633$\n\n<<<21.6633>>>"
