Based on the information, the most pertinent counseling recommendation a pharmacist could make is to inform Allison that the smell of seawater she experienced was likely a phantom smell, which can be a rare symptom of a migraine aura. Since her headache improved with Excedrin, it's possible she had a migraine with this unusual type of aura. The pharmacist should also mention that headaches can be a side effect of Junel Fe and Fluoxetine, and that, rarely, Atorvastatin and Fluoxetine can affect one's sense of smell. Therefore, it is important for her to monitor for this happening again and to follow up with her doctor to discuss these symptoms and review her medications.
