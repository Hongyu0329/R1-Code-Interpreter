    "The \"rule activation level,\" in the context of a Mamdani fuzzy inference system, refers to the result of the implication step, where the antecedent's firing strength is used to shape the consequent's fuzzy set. This shaping is performed using a t-norm (fuzzy AND) operation between the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership function of the consequent.\n\nThe provided values are:\n*   The antecedent firing strength, `Phi_k(x′)`, is 0.7.\n*   The membership degree of the consequent at a specific point `y_j`, `μG_k_j(y_j)`, is 0.9.\n\nEven though the context is an interval type-3 fuzzy set, the calculation boils down to a fundamental t-norm operation on the given scalar values. This is because complex fuzzy systems like type-3 still use the foundational operations of fuzzy logic (like t-norms), applying them to the various levels and slices that define their more complex uncertainty models. The question simplifies the problem to a single point calculation.\n\nThe rule activation at the specific point `y_j` is calculated as:\n`Activation = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n`Activation = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n\nSince the specific t-norm is not mentioned, the result will vary depending on the chosen operator. The two most common t-norms used in fuzzy systems are the minimum (min) and the product.\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum (min) t-norm:** This is the most common choice in Mamdani systems.\n    *   Activation = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Using the Product t-norm:** This is another widely used operator.\n    *   Activation = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7 using the minimum t-norm or 0.63 using the product t-norm.\n\n<<<The rule activation level is 0.7 when using the common minimum t-norm and 0.63 when using the product t-norm.>>>"
