    "Final Answer: In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures.\n\nThe paper is a theoretical work and does not contain a bibliography or list of references to the work of other scientists. Accounts from Einstein himself state that he was unaware of previous experimental observations of Brownian motion at the time of writing. Scholarly articles about the paper also indicate its self-contained, theoretical nature, developed from his own work on statistical mechanics.\n\n<<<In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures. The paper is a theoretical work and does not contain a list of references.>>>"
