    "The Christian theologian who first developed a specialized, systematic terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Thomas Aquinas**.\n\nAquinas created a comprehensive framework that distinguished between the natural, supernatural, and preternatural orders, allowing for a detailed explanation of miracles and divine intervention in relation to the created world. His terminology provides a way to understand how God can act outside the usual course of nature without contradicting the natural laws He established.\n\nKey elements of Aquinas's specialized terminology include:\n*   **Natural vs. Supernatural:** Aquinas made a clear distinction between the *natural order*, which operates according to the principles God embedded in creation, and the *supernatural order*, which involves direct divine intervention and is known through revelation. For Aquinas, \"grace does not destroy nature, but perfects it.\"\n*   **Acts \"Above the Law of Nature\":** He described Christ's conception as being \"above the law of conception\". Miraculous events like the virgin birth were not seen as violating nature, but as supernatural acts transcending the ordinary course of nature. In a quotation he utilized, he contrasted the two states: \"After giving birth, nature knows not a virgin: but grace enhances her fruitfulness, and effects her motherhood, while in no way does it injure her virginity.\"\n*   **Corruption of the Good of Nature:** Regarding the Fall, Aquinas provided a systematic analysis of its effects, which he termed the \"corruption of the good of nature.\" He specified that human nature's inclination to virtue was not destroyed but \"diminished\" by sin. This shows the application of his framework to describe a change in the state of humanity relative to its original created nature.\n*   **Miracles as *Praeter Naturam* (Beyond Nature):** Aquinas refined the language for miracles, arguing they are not so much *contra naturam* (against nature) as *praeter cursum naturae* (outside the course of nature). A miracle is an effect produced by God that is beyond the capacity of natural causes to produce, operating under the higher law of divine providence.\n\nWhile earlier theologians like Augustine of Hippo laid much of the foundation by affirming these miracles, it was Aquinas who developed the precise philosophical and theological vocabulary to explain *how* such events could occur in relation to a world governed by natural laws.\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
