    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, C7H8, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated by determining the number of functions for each atom and summing them up.\n\nFirst, the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each element must be determined for the 6-31G basis set:\n*   **For a Carbon (C) atom:** A carbon atom has a 1s core orbital and 2s and 2p valence orbitals. In the 6-31G basis set, the core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function. The valence orbitals (2s and three 2p orbitals) are each split into two, an inner and an outer part. This results in 1 (for the 1s orbital) + 4 (for the inner valence 2s and 2p orbitals) + 4 (for the outer valence 2s and 2p orbitals), totaling 9 contracted Gaussian functions per carbon atom.\n*   **For a Hydrogen (H) atom:** A hydrogen atom only has a 1s valence orbital and no core orbitals. In the 6-31G basis set, this valence orbital is split into an inner and an outer part, resulting in 2 contracted Gaussian functions per hydrogen atom.\n\nNext, we calculate the total for toluene (C7H8), which has 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms:\n*   Total functions for Carbon = 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   Total functions for Hydrogen = 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\nFinally, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene molecule is the sum of the functions for all its atoms:\n*   Total contracted Gaussian functions = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
