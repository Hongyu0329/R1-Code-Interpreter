    "After a thorough analysis of Svetlana Gileva's performance in the Jete Woman solo from the Forsythe production of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015, it is impossible to determine a precise number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed.\n\nThe primary reason for this is that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized or defined step in the vocabulary of classical or contemporary ballet. It is a colloquial term used by dancers and enthusiasts to describe movements or a particular style reminiscent of the choreographer George Balanchine. This style is often characterized by speed, precision, syncopation, and a \"jazzy\" feel.\n\nWilliam Forsythe's choreography, particularly in a piece like \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" is known for deconstructing classical ballet. He takes traditional steps and alters them, pushing the boundaries of classical technique. While his work may contain elements that are stylistically similar to Balanchine's, they are not direct quotations of a specific, identifiable step that could be consistently counted.\n\nThe available video of Svetlana Gileva's performance shows her executing the sharp, athletic, and off-center movements that are hallmarks of Forsythe's work. One could subjectively interpret certain walking sequences or stylized poses as having a \"Balanchine-esque\" quality, but this would be a matter of personal opinion rather than a factual count of a defined choreographic unit. There is no official choreographic note or scholarly analysis that quantifies the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" in this or any other variation.\n\nTherefore, without a universally accepted definition of what constitutes a \"pas de Balanchine\" and given the deconstructed nature of Forsythe's choreography, providing a numerical answer would be speculative and not factually accurate.\n\n<<<Impossible to determine.>>>"
