    "An optimal Nickel-to-Ceria (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is crucial for maximizing catalytic performance in both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). However, the ideal ratio is not a single value and depends on the specific reaction conditions and the desired catalytic outcome.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, which is used to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide from carbon monoxide and water, research indicates an optimal range for the nickel content.\n\nStudies on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts show that while the reaction can be initiated at around 200°C, high CO conversion is typically achieved at higher temperatures. There is no significant difference in the light-off temperature for catalysts with nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt %. However, at 400°C, CO conversion levels are very similar and high for catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni, reaching approximately 95%. Another study also investigated catalysts with Ni content in the range of 5-15 at. % (equivalent to 2-8 wt. %).\n\nIn the context of the reverse Water Gas Shift (rWGS) reaction, which converts CO₂ and H₂ to CO and water, an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar has been identified. This composition was found to produce the maximum yield of CO. Higher nickel loadings of 10% molar resulted in similar conversion and selectivity to the optimal 7% molar loading.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nThe ideal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting—the process of dissociating water into hydrogen and oxygen—varies more significantly depending on the specific application, such as thermochemical or electrochemical water splitting, and whether the focus is on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).\n\n**Thermochemical Water Splitting:**\n*   Computational studies suggest that a **Ni/Ce ratio of 3:1** provides a more favorable adsorption energy and, therefore, better catalytic properties for the water-splitting reaction.\n\n**Electrochemical Water Splitting (Electrolysis):**\n*   **For the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):** In studies of Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts, a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (or a Ni/Ce ratio of 1:2)** was found to be optimal for HER performance.\n*   **For the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):** Research on NiᵧCe₁₀₀₋ᵧOₓ electrocatalysts identified that those with **Ni/Ce ratios of 3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ) and 1:1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ)** exhibited larger electrochemically active surface areas and superior performance for the OER. Another study on co-doped ceria suggested that a high doping level of **20 mol% Ni (a Ni/Ce ratio of 1:4)** in CeO₂ nanostructures showed excellent HER and OER activities.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the target reaction:\n*   **For the WGS reaction**, a nickel content in the range of **7-12.5%** (molar or weight percent) appears to be optimal.\n*   **For water splitting**, the ideal ratio varies more widely, from **3:1 to 1:4 (Ni/Ce)**, depending on the specific process (thermochemical vs. electrochemical) and the targeted half-reaction (HER vs. OER).\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing the catalytic performance depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is between 7% and 12.5% nickel content. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies more significantly, with studies indicating optimal performance at Ni/Ce ratios of 3:1 for thermochemical water splitting, 1:2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and ratios between 3:1 and 1:4 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical water splitting.>>>"
