The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing the catalytic performance depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is between 7% and 12.5% nickel content. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies more significantly, with studies indicating optimal performance at Ni/Ce ratios of 3:1 for thermochemical water splitting, 1:2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and ratios between 3:1 and 1:4 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical water splitting.
