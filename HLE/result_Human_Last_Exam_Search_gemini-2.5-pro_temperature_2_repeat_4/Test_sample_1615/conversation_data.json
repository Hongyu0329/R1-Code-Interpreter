    "Let $n=12345$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$. We are given that $G$ is not a complete graph. We want to find the maximum possible value for the chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\\chi(G)$.\n\nFor any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$. The chromatic number is equal to $n$ if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $K_n$. This is because in a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, thus requiring a unique color for each vertex.\n\nSince the graph $G$ is not a complete graph, there exists at least one pair of vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. Because there is no edge between $u$ and $v$, they can be assigned the same color. This leaves the remaining $n-2$ vertices. In the most extreme case, each of these remaining vertices might require a unique color, different from the color assigned to $u$ and $v$ and different from each other. This leads to an upper bound of $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors. Therefore, for a graph with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete, the chromatic number can be at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nTo determine if this maximum value is achievable, we need to find a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of 12344.\nConsider a graph $G$ constructed as follows: take a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and add a single vertex that is not connected to any other vertex (an isolated vertex).\n\nThis graph $G$ has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\nIt is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ component.\nThe chromatic number of this graph $G$ is determined by the maximum chromatic number of its connected components. The components are the $K_{12344}$ and the isolated vertex. The chromatic number of $K_{12344}$ is 12344, and the chromatic number of a single vertex is 1. The maximum of these is 12344. Thus, $\\chi(G)=12344$.\n\nThis construction demonstrates that a chromatic number of 12344 is achievable for a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete. Since we have established that the chromatic number cannot exceed 12344, this is the maximum possible value.\n\nAnother way to think about this is using Brooks's Theorem, which states that for any connected graph $G$, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most its maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. For these exceptional cases, $\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G)+1$. If the graph is not complete, the maximum degree is at most $n-1 = 12344$. So for any connected non-complete graph, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 12344$, unless it is an odd cycle where $\\chi(C_{12345}) = 3$. If the graph is disconnected, as in our constructed example, its chromatic number is the maximum of its components' chromatic numbers, leading to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
