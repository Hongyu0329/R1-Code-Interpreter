    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. This reaction involves a phosphonium ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with a carbonyl compound.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde**: Also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, it is an aldehyde with a sterically bulky tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl group. Its chemical formula is (CH₃)₃CCHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**: This is the phosphonium ylide (Wittig reagent). The \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" part indicates a PPh₃ group. This is attached to an \"ethylidene\" group (-CH-CH₃), which is substituted at the second carbon with a \"2-chlorophenyl\" group. The ylide structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl). This type of ylide, where the carbon atom adjacent to the phosphorus is attached to alkyl groups, is considered a non-stabilized ylide.\n\nThe reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the ylide's carbanion on the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon. This is followed by the formation of a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to yield the final alkene product and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O). A key advantage of the Wittig reaction is that the new double bond forms precisely where the carbonyl group was located.\n\nFor non-stabilized ylides reacting with aldehydes, the reaction typically shows a preference for the formation of the (Z)-alkene (where the highest priority substituents are on the same side of the double bond).\n\nBy combining the tert-butyl group from pivalaldehyde and the (2-chlorobenzyl) group from the ylide, the resulting alkene product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nGiven the nature of the non-stabilized ylide, the (Z)-isomer, (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, is expected to be the major product.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
