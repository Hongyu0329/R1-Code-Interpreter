    "The search results indicate several methods for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n*   **Direct reaction of Xenon and Fluorine at elevated temperature:** This is the most common method cited. A mixture of xenon and fluorine gas (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio) is heated in a nickel container. The reaction temperature is consistently reported to be around 400°C. Patents also describe this method with a temperature range of 350-450°C, with 400°C being preferred. Flow methods also use a similar temperature range of 300-500°C.\n*   **Electric discharge:** Another mentioned method involves passing an electric discharge through a mixture of xenon and fluorine. One source mentions this can be done at low temperatures, but it results in contamination with XeF2.\n*   **Photochemical reaction:** This method uses UV irradiation on a mixture of xenon and fluorine. Another source specifies that γ- or UV-irradiation in a nickel container can be used. A photochemical process to produce XeF2 is mentioned to occur at -78°C. However, for XeF4, while photochemical methods exist, the specific temperatures for an *efficient* production are not clearly stated as being very low. In fact, a photochemical reaction for XeF2 is mentioned as an alternative to a thermal one at 400-500°C.\n*   **Reaction with O2F2:** XeF4 can react with O2F2 between 140 and 195 K (-133.15 °C to -78.15 °C) to produce XeF6, which is a different compound. This indicates reactions involving xenon fluorides can occur at very low temperatures.\n*   **Combustion method:** A patent describes a method where a combustion initiator is heated to 650-700°C to start the reaction of xenon and fluorine. This is a high-temperature initiation.\n\nThe most frequently cited and apparently most efficient and common method is the direct thermal reaction at 400°C. Although other methods like electric discharge at \"low temperatures\" exist, they are noted to produce impurities. The question asks for the coldest temperature at which XeF4 can be produced *efficiently*. The common and well-documented efficient synthesis occurs at 400°C.\n\nComparing this to the answer choices:\nA. 600 C\nB. 400 C\nC. 200 C\nD. 78 C\nE. 0 C\nF. -78 C\n\nThe temperature of 400°C is explicitly listed as an answer choice. Although lower temperature reactions exist for xenon fluorides in general (e.g., for XeF2 or further reaction of XeF4), the primary and efficient synthesis of XeF4 itself is consistently reported at this temperature. Therefore, 400°C appears to be the correct answer based on the provided information for efficient production.\n\nI am confident in the information I have gathered. The primary method for efficient production of XeF4 is heating Xenon and Fluorine to 400°C.The most common and efficient method for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gases. This process is typically carried out by heating a mixture of the elements, usually in a 1:5 molar ratio, within a nickel container. Nickel is used for the reaction vessel because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface, which prevents further corrosion by the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nThe optimal temperature for this reaction to proceed efficiently and yield XeF₄ is approximately 400°C. This temperature is high enough to facilitate the reaction at a reasonable rate. While patents have specified a temperature range of 350-450°C, 400°C is often cited as the preferred temperature. Using a flow method, where the gases are passed through a heated nickel tube, a similar temperature range of 300-500°C is employed.\n\nOther methods for the synthesis of xenon fluorides exist, such as using electric discharge or photochemical reactions with UV light. While an electric discharge method can be conducted at low temperatures, it tends to produce XeF₂ as a significant impurity. Although some reactions involving xenon fluorides can occur at very low temperatures, the direct, efficient synthesis of xenon tetrafluoride from its elements is best achieved at elevated temperatures.\n\nConsidering the provided options, 400°C is the most accurately reported temperature for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
