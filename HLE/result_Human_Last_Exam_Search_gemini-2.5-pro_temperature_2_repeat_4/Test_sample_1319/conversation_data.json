    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Athos.\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in Homer's epic poem. Besides Mount Olympus, which is the highest mountain in Greece at 9,570 feet (2,917 meters) and the mythical home of the gods, other notable peaks play a role in the narrative.\n\nThe mountains mentioned and their respective heights are:\n\n*   **Mount Athos:** This mountain on the Chalkidiki peninsula in northeastern Greece has an elevation of 6,670 feet (2,033 meters). Homer mentions Athos in the *Iliad*. It is also the site of a monastic community.\n*   **Mount Ida (in Turkey):** Located near the ancient city of Troy, this mountain, now known as Kaz Dağı, has an elevation of 5,820 feet (1,770 meters). In the *Iliad*, it is a significant location from which the gods, particularly Zeus, observe the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Saos (or Fengari) on Samothrace:** This is the highest peak on the island of Samothrace, rising to an elevation of 5,285 feet (1,611 meters). In the *Iliad*, the god Poseidon is said to have watched the battle of Troy from its summit.\n\nAnother prominent mountain in Greek mythology is Mount Ida on the island of Crete, which is the island's highest point at 8,058 feet (2,456 meters). While significant as the mythical birthplace of Zeus, the Mount Ida more central to the *Iliad's* narrative is the one in Anatolia, overlooking Troy.\n\nComparing the historical mountains explicitly mentioned in the context of the Trojan War in the *Iliad*, Mount Athos is the tallest after Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
