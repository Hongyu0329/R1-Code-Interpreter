    "The number of non-Grassman variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with two replicas is determined by the dimensionality of the bosonic part of the corresponding target space.\n\nFor symmetry class D with *n* replicas, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model is given by the coset `SpO(2n, R|2n) / U(n|n)`. We are interested in the case where *n* = 2.\n\nThe bosonic (non-Grassman) sector of this target space is the coset space formed by the maximal bosonic subgroups of the respective supergroups.\n\n1.  **Numerator: `SpO(4, R|4)`**\n    The bosonic subgroup of the supergroup `SpO(2n, R|2n)` is `Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)`. For n=2, this is `Sp(4, R) × O(4)`.\n    *   The dimension of the real symplectic group `Sp(2n, R)` is `n(2n + 1)`. For n=2, `dim(Sp(4, R)) = 2(2*2 + 1) = 10`.\n    *   The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(n)` is `n(n - 1) / 2`. For n=4, `dim(O(4)) = 4(4 - 1) / 2 = 6`.\n    *   Therefore, the total dimension of the bosonic subgroup of the numerator is 10 + 6 = 16.\n\n2.  **Denominator: `U(2|2)`**\n    The bosonic subgroup of the unitary supergroup `U(n|n)` is `U(n) × U(n)`. For n=2, this is `U(2) × U(2)`.\n    *   The dimension of the unitary group `U(n)` is `n^2`. For n=2, `dim(U(2)) = 2^2 = 4`.\n    *   Therefore, the total dimension of the bosonic subgroup of the denominator is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of the resulting bosonic manifold, which is the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic subgroups of the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumber of variables = `dim(Sp(4, R) × O(4)) - dim(U(2) × U(2))`\nNumber of variables = 16 - 8 = 8\n\n<<<8>>>"
