    "The classification of finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their 2009 paper, \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". A product-free set S in a group G is a set where for any two elements x, y in S (including x=y), their product xy is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G.\n\nBased on the classification provided in this paper, there are exactly 11 such finite groups (up to isomorphism). The classification is divided into cases depending on whether the product-free set S generates the group G or a proper subgroup of G.\n\nThe 11 finite groups are:\n*   Five cyclic groups: C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, and C₁₀.\n*   The Klein four-group: C₂ × C₂.\n*   Two dihedral groups: D₆ (the dihedral group of order 6, isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃) and D₈ (the dihedral group of order 8).\n*   Two generalized quaternion groups: Q₈ (the quaternion group of order 8) and Q₁₂ (the dicyclic group of order 12).\n\nTo summarize the count:\n1.  **C₅** (Cyclic group of order 5)\n2.  **C₆** (Cyclic group of order 6)\n3.  **C₇** (Cyclic group of order 7)\n4.  **C₈** (Cyclic group of order 8)\n5.  **C₉** (Cyclic group of order 9)\n6.  **C₁₀** (Cyclic group of order 10)\n7.  **C₂ × C₂** (The Klein four-group)\n8.  **D₆** (Dihedral group of order 6)\n9.  **D₈** (Dihedral group of order 8)\n10. **Q₈** (Quaternion group)\n11. **Q₁₂** (Dicyclic group of order 12)\n\nSubsequent research in the field consistently refers to this classification as complete.\n\n<<<11>>>"
