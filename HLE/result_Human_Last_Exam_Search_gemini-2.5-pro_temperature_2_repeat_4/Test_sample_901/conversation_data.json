    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The reagent, potassium tert-butoxide, is a strong, sterically hindered base which favors the formation of the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\nFor an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring system, the leaving group (bromine) and the hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon must be in an anti-periplanar or trans-diaxial arrangement. The starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *trans* isomer. In its more stable chair conformation, both the bromine and the methyl group would occupy equatorial positions. For the elimination reaction to proceed, the molecule must flip to a less stable conformation where the bromine is in an axial position.\n\nIn the conformation where the bromine atom is axial, we examine the beta-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the one bearing the bromine) to find one that is also axial and on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n1.  **Elimination towards the methyl group (C2)**: This would form the more substituted Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene. However, in the trans configuration, when the bromine is axial, the methyl group is also axial. The only hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. Since there is no hydrogen in an anti-periplanar position to the bromine on C2, this elimination pathway is not possible.\n\n2.  **Elimination away from the methyl group (C6)**: This forms the less substituted Hofmann product, 3-methylcyclohexene. The carbon at position 6 has two hydrogens. One of these will be in an axial position, which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n\nBecause a trans-diaxial arrangement is required for the E2 elimination and is only possible for a beta-hydrogen on C6, the reaction can only proceed in that direction. The bulky nature of the potassium tert-butoxide further favors the abstraction of the less sterically hindered proton at C6. Therefore, the exclusive product of this reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
