    "For a well-controlled five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 detection channels, you should prepare a minimum of 13 essential controls.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the necessary controls:\n\n*   **Unstained Controls (2):**\n    *   **Unstained Cells:** This control is crucial to determine the natural autofluorescence of your cells, which helps in setting the baseline for fluorescence detection.\n    *   **Unstained Beads:** Running streptavidin beads alone allows you to assess their intrinsic fluorescence and light-scattering properties.\n\n*   **Compensation Controls (5):**\n    *   For a multicolor experiment, single-stained samples for each fluorochrome are essential to correct for spectral overlap, a phenomenon where the emission of one dye is detected in another's channel. You will need one for each of your five fluorochromes: AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750. Compensation beads are often used for this purpose as they provide a bright, consistent signal.\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5):**\n    *   FMO controls are critical for accurately setting gates, especially in multicolor experiments. An FMO control includes all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. This helps to visualize the spread of fluorescence from the other dyes into the \"empty\" channel, allowing for precise gate placement. For a five-channel experiment, you should ideally prepare an FMO control for each of the five channels.\n\n*   **Viability Control (1):**\n    *   It is essential to exclude dead cells from your sort, as they can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. A viability dye, such as DAPI or a fixable viability dye, should be used. A control sample of cells, some of which are induced to be dead (e.g., through heat treatment), is needed to set the gate to distinguish live from dead cells.\n\nWhile not always mandatory, you might also consider including biological controls (cells known to be positive or negative for your markers) and isotype controls to check for non-specific binding of your antibodies, although FMO controls are generally considered more robust for gating in multicolor assays. Careful planning and execution of these controls are vital for obtaining reliable and reproducible sorting results.\n\n<<<13>>>"
