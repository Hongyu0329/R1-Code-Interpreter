    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster**.\n\nHere is the linguistic path from the original Anglo-Saxon word to this hypothetical modern equivalent:\n\n1.  **Old English:** The word used by the Anglo-Saxons for a female sibling was *sweostor* or, in some dialects, *swuster*. This word is part of the common Germanic family of words for \"sister,\" as seen in the German *Schwester* and Dutch *zuster*.\n\n2.  **Norse Influence:** The word we use today, \"sister,\" did not evolve directly from *sweostor*. It was heavily influenced by the Old Norse word *systir*, which was brought to England by Viking invaders. The change from the \"eo\" or \"u\" vowel sound in Old English to the \"i\" sound in Modern English is a direct result of this linguistic contact.\n\n3.  **Middle English Divergence:** In Middle English, both the native and the Norse-influenced forms existed simultaneously. The native form evolved into *suster*, while the Norse-influenced version appeared as *sister*. Over time, the Norse form *sister* became dominant and replaced the original English one.\n\n4.  **Hypothetical Evolution:** Had there been no Norse influence, the native word *suster* would have continued its natural evolution into Modern English. The short \"u\" vowel sound in *suster* (pronounced like the \"u\" in \"put\") would have likely undergone the same sound change that affected words like \"cup\" or \"butter,\" shifting to the /ÊŒ/ sound.\n\nTherefore, the native Anglo-Saxon term *sweostor* would have become *suster* in Modern English.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
