    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject of the Question:** The question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of a specific type of medication container under specific conditions.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Key Terms:**\n    *   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** As defined by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), this is the date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) or a punctured single-dose container shall not be used, stored, or transported. It's a matter of safety and sterility.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container Ampule:** This is the specific container type. It is crucial to distinguish between an **ampule** and a **vial**.\n        *   An **ampule** is a sealed glass (or sometimes plastic) container that is broken at its neck to be opened. Once opened, it *cannot be resealed*.\n        *   A vial has a rubber stopper that allows for puncture with a needle and theoretically reseals itself after the needle is withdrawn.\n    *   **Puncture:** For an ampule, this means breaking it open.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** This implies the handling occurs inside an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a compounding aseptic isolator (CAI). This is the cleanest environment for sterile compounding.\n\n3.  **Consult the Governing Standard:** The rules for sterile compounding and BUDs are set by the **USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations**.\n\n4.  **Apply the USP <797> Rule:**\n    *   USP <797> provides different rules for different container types and environments.\n    *   The rule for an **ampule** is very strict. Because an ampule is an open system once broken and cannot be resealed to protect its contents from the environment, it is highly susceptible to contamination.\n    *   Therefore, the standard requires that once an ampule is opened, its contents must be used **immediately**.\n    *   Any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be discarded right away. It cannot be stored for any period, regardless of the cleanliness of the environment.\n\n5.  **Distinguish from a Single-Dose Vial (A Common Point of Confusion):**\n    *   It's important not to confuse an ampule with a single-dose *vial*.\n    *   For a single-dose *vial* punctured within a sterile ISO Class 5 environment, USP <797> allows it to be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture. This is because the rubber stopper provides a barrier that can be repeatedly punctured while maintaining sterility.\n    *   This 12-hour rule **does not apply** to ampules.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Container Specificity:** The most critical point is that the question specifies an **ampule**. The rules for ampules and vials are different.\n2.  **Inability to Reseal:** The fundamental reason for the immediate-use rule for ampules is their physical design; they cannot be closed again after opening.\n3.  **Environment Doesn't Change the Rule:** Even though the ampule is opened in the cleanest possible environment (ISO Class 5), the no-storage rule still applies because it's an open container.\n4.  **Definition of \"Immediate Use\":** This means the contents must be drawn up and used in a single, continuous operation as part of the compounding process. There should be no delay or storage of the opened ampule.\n5.  **Discard Remainder:** Any medication left in the ampule after the required dose is withdrawn must be disposed of and cannot be used later.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis and adherence to USP <797> standards, the BUD for a single-dose ampule once it has been opened is **immediate**. There is no allowable storage time. The medication must be used at once, and any remaining portion must be discarded.\n\n<<<Immediate Use. The opened ampule cannot be stored and any unused portion must be discarded immediately.>>>"
