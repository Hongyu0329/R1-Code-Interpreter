    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Threat Model:** The question asks about security against an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\" This implies we need to consider attacks that leverage quantum mechanics, not just classical computers. For symmetric key cryptography, the primary threat from a quantum computer is a brute-force search attack accelerated by a specific quantum algorithm.\n\n2.  **Classical Brute-Force Attack:** On a classical computer, the method to \"crack\" a symmetric key without any other known vulnerability is a brute-force search. This involves trying every possible key until the correct one is found. For a key of length `n` bits, there are `2^n` possible keys. On average, a classical computer would need to try `2^(n-1)` keys, and in the worst case, all `2^n` keys. The difficulty of this attack is therefore on the order of `2^n` operations. We call this having `n` bits of security. For example, AES-128 has a 128-bit key, providing 128 bits of security against classical brute-force.\n\n3.  **Quantum Brute-Force Attack:** An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer can use **Grover's algorithm** to speed up searches. Grover's algorithm can search an unstructured database of `N` items in approximately `sqrt(N)` steps, which is a quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm which takes O(N) steps.\n    *   In the context of cracking a symmetric key of length `n`, the \"database\" is the set of all possible keys, so `N = 2^n`.\n    *   A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm can therefore find the key in roughly `sqrt(2^n)` steps.\n    *   `sqrt(2^n) = (2^n)^(1/2) = 2^(n/2)`.\n    *   This means a quantum computer effectively halves the number of bits of security. A symmetric key of length `n` provides only `n/2` bits of security against a quantum computer.\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Security Level:** For a cryptographic system to be considered \"secure\" for the foreseeable future, security experts and organizations like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) generally agree that it must provide at least a **128-bit security level**. This means an attacker would need to perform a computational task equivalent to at least `2^128` classical operations. We want our key to maintain this security level *even when attacked by a quantum computer*.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Key Length:**\n    *   Let `k` be the length of the symmetric key.\n    *   The post-quantum security level (the security against a quantum computer) is `k/2` bits.\n    *   We require this post-quantum security level to be at least 128 bits.\n    *   So, we set up the inequality: `k / 2 ≥ 128`\n    *   Solving for `k`: `k ≥ 2 * 128`\n    *   `k ≥ 256`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** To achieve a 128-bit security level against an attack by a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm, the symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography:** The impact of quantum computers is very different for symmetric and asymmetric algorithms. While Grover's algorithm offers a quadratic speedup against symmetric ciphers (like AES), Shor's algorithm can break the most common asymmetric ciphers (like RSA and ECC) in polynomial time, effectively rendering them completely insecure. The question specifically asks about symmetric keys, so Grover's algorithm is the relevant threat.\n*   **128-bit Security as a Benchmark:** A 128-bit key (like in AES-128) provides 128 bits of security against a classical computer, which is considered secure today. However, against a quantum computer, its security level drops to `128 / 2 = 64` bits. A `2^64` computation is considered feasible to break, so AES-128 is not quantum-resistant.\n*   **The Minimum Requirement:** The question asks for the minimum length (\"at least\"). While a 512-bit key would also be secure (providing `512 / 2 = 256` bits of security), 256 bits is the minimum required to meet the 128-bit post-quantum security threshold.\n\nBased on this analysis, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long.\n\n<<<A>>>"
