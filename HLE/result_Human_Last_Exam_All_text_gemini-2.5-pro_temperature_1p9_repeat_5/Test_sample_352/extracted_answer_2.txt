To relieve the autoinhibition caused by the negatively charged patch at positions 47-50 (Serine-Glutamate-Glutamate-Aspartate), the best replacement for all four amino acids would be Alanine (A). This would change the sequence from SEED to AAAA. This substitution is ideal because Alanine is a small, uncharged amino acid that will neutralize the negative charges of Glutamate and Aspartate. Furthermore, replacing Serine with Alanine will prevent phosphorylation at position 47, thus eliminating the source of the strongest negative charge in the patch. This creates a chemically inert patch and is the standard method to test the function of charged or modifiable residues with minimal structural disruption.
