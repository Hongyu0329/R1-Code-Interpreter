    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the fundamental properties of the function $f$.\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. Using the given equation, this implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function $y=e^x$ is strictly increasing, it is injective, so we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** We are given that $f$ is a continuous function. A continuous and injective function mapping $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case where $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n\n1.  A continuous, strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have exactly one fixed point. A fixed point is a value $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *   To prove this, consider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ is continuous, $g$ is also continuous.\n    *   Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = M$ (where $M$ can be a real number or $+\\infty$) and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L$ (where $L$ can be a real number or $-\\infty$), with $L < M$.\n    *   Then, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = M - (-\\infty) = +\\infty$.\n    *   And, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = L - (+\\infty) = -\\infty$.\n    *   Since $g(x)$ is a continuous function that goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one point $x_0$ where $g(x_0) = 0$. This implies $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *   The fixed point is unique because if there were two fixed points $x_0, x_1$ with $x_0 < x_1$, we would have $f(x_0)=x_0$ and $f(x_1)=x_1$. But since $f$ is strictly decreasing, $x_0 < x_1$ implies $f(x_0) > f(x_1)$, which means $x_0 > x_1$, a contradiction.\n\n2.  Let $x_0$ be the unique fixed point of $f$. So, $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    Applying $f$ again gives $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n\n3.  From the original equation, we have $f(f(x_0)) = e^{x_0}$.\n    Comparing the two results, we must have $e^{x_0} = x_0$.\n\n4.  The equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions. This can be seen by considering the function $h(x) = e^x - x$. Its derivative is $h'(x) = e^x - 1$. The minimum value of $h(x)$ occurs at $x=0$, where $h'(0)=0$. The minimum value is $h(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. Since the minimum value is 1, $h(x)$ is always positive, so $e^x - x > 0$, meaning $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n5.  The requirement $e^{x_0} = x_0$ leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there are no continuous, strictly decreasing functions satisfying the given equation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case where $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\n1.  If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing. The function $e^x$ is strictly increasing, which is consistent with this case.\n\n2.  Let's compare $f(x)$ with $x$. If there were a fixed point $x_0$ with $f(x_0) = x_0$, we would again arrive at the contradiction $e^{x_0} = x_0$. Therefore, $f$ has no fixed points.\n\n3.  Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, its graph must lie entirely above or entirely below the line $y=x$. That is, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$, or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n    *   Assume $f(x) < x$ for all $x$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, applying $f$ to both sides of the inequality gives $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining the inequalities, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$.\n    *   However, we are given $f(f(x)) = e^x$, and we know that $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This creates a contradiction: $f(f(x)) < x$ and $f(f(x)) > x$.\n    *   Therefore, the assumption $f(x) < x$ must be false.\n\n4.  We must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying the increasing function $f$ to this inequality gives $f(f(x)) > f(x)$.\n    So we have the relationship $x < f(x) < f(f(x)) = e^x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing solutions and determining the cardinality.\n\nWe need to count the number of continuous, strictly increasing functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x < f(x) < e^x$ and $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n1.  **Freedom of choice:** The structure of the solution can be determined by specifying the function on a particular interval. From $f(f(x)) = e^x$, one can derive the commutation relation $f(e^x) = f(f(f(x))) = e^{f(x)}$. This relation suggests that the behavior of $f$ on an interval like $[a, e^a)$ determines its behavior on $[e^a, e^{e^a})$, and so on. A convenient starting point is the interval $[0,1]$.\n\n2.  **Define a \"seed\" function:** Let's define the restriction of $f$ to the interval $[0,1]$. Let this function be $g: [0,1] \\to [f(0), f(1)]$.\n    *   $g$ must be continuous and strictly increasing.\n    *   Let $f(0)=c$. From the condition $x < f(x) < e^x$, for $x=0$, we have $0 < f(0) < e^0$, so $0 < c < 1$.\n    *   Using the commutation relation $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ at $x=0$, we get $f(1) = e^{f(0)} = e^c$.\n    *   So, our seed function $g$ must be a continuous, strictly increasing function on $[0,1]$ that connects the point $(0,c)$ to the point $(1, e^c)$, for some choice of $c \\in (0,1)$.\n    *   Additionally, $g$ must satisfy $x < g(x) < e^x$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. Let's check the endpoints. At $x=0$, we need $0 < g(0) < e^0 \\implies 0 < c < 1$. At $x=1$, we need $1 < g(1) < e^1 \\implies 1 < e^c < e$, which again implies $0 < c < 1$.\n\n3.  **Counting the seed functions:** For each choice of a real number $c \\in (0,1)$, we can define a seed function $g_c$.\n    *   For a given $c \\in (0,1)$, consider the straight-line function $g_c(x) = (e^c - c)x + c$. This function is continuous, strictly increasing, and satisfies $g_c(0)=c$ and $g_c(1)=e^c$. One can verify that this function lies strictly between $y=x$ and $y=e^x$ on $[0,1]$.\n    *   The choice of $c$ can be any number in the interval $(0,1)$. The set $(0,1)$ has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., of $\\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such seed functions, and thus at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions for $f$.\n    *   Moreover, for any fixed $c \\in (0,1)$, there are infinitely many curves we can draw. One can take the linear function $g_c(x)$ and add a small \"bump\" function (e.g., $\\alpha x(1-x)$ for a suitable range of constants $\\alpha$) to create another valid seed function. The set of such valid seed functions for a fixed $c$ can be shown to have cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Cardinality:**\n    *   We have shown that the number of possible solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Any solution $f$ is a continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. The set of all such functions, $C(\\mathbb{R})$, has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. (A continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ is uniquely determined by its values on the dense subset of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $|C(\\mathbb{R})| = |\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q}}| = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.)\n    *   The set of solutions, let's call it $S$, is a subset of $C(\\mathbb{R})$. Therefore, the cardinality of $S$ is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Since we have $|S| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$ and $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$, by the Cantor-Bernstein-SchrÃ¶der theorem, we must have $|S| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum."
