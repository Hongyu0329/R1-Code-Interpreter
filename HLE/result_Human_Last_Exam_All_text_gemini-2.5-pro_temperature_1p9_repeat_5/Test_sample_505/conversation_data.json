    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the System Configuration\n\nThe question describes a system composed of:\n1.  **Two patches of surface code:** This means we have two separate, independent surface codes. The total number of logical qubits will be the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n    *   `k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2`\n2.  **With two holes:** This phrase describes the topology of the patches. The most natural interpretation of \"two patches... with two holes\" is that *each* patch has two holes punched into it. The question asks for the *maximum* number, and this configuration yields a higher number of logical qubits than distributing the two holes between the two patches (e.g., one hole in each, or two in one and zero in the other). We will proceed with this interpretation to find the maximum.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code\n\nLet's determine the number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a single patch with two holes.\n\n1.  **Topology of a Patch:** A single, standard patch of surface code is topologically equivalent to a disk or a 2D plane. This type of surface has a genus `g=0` and one boundary component (`b=1`), which is its outer edge.\n2.  **Introducing Holes:** When we \"punch a hole\" into the surface, we create a new, distinct boundary on the interior of the patch.\n    *   A patch with *two* holes will have its original outer boundary plus two new inner boundaries (one for each hole).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of boundary components for one patch is `b = 1 (outer) + 2 (inner) = 3`.\n    *   The genus of the surface remains `g=0`.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Formula for Logical Qubits\n\nFor a topological surface code, the number of logical qubits `k` it can encode is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is laid. The general formula for a surface with genus `g` and `b` boundary components is:\n\n*   `k = 2g + b - 1` (for `b > 0`, i.e., at least one boundary)\n*   `k = 2g` (for `b = 0`, a closed surface like a torus)\n\nFor our single patch:\n*   Genus `g = 0`\n*   Number of boundaries `b = 3`\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n*   `k_patch = 2 * (0) + 3 - 1`\n*   `k_patch = 0 + 2`\n*   `k_patch = 2`\n\nSo, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode 2 logical qubits.\n\n**Intuitive Explanation:** With `b` distinct boundaries, you can form `b-1` independent logical qubits. Each logical qubit requires a pair of logical operators (e.g., `X_L` and `Z_L`) that anticommute. These operators are defined as paths between different boundaries. With 3 boundaries (B1, B2, B3), you can define a basis for your logical qubits using paths between (B1, B2) and (B1, B3). A path between (B2, B3) can be constructed from the other two, so it's not independent. This confirms the `b-1 = 2` logical qubits.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits\n\nSince the system consists of two independent and identical patches, we simply add the number of logical qubits from each.\n\n*   `k_patch1 = 2`\n*   `k_patch2 = 2`\n*   `k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2 = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"two patches... with two holes\" is key. Interpreting this as \"two holes *per patch*\" yields the maximum possible number of qubits. Any other interpretation (like two holes in total distributed between the patches) would result in a smaller number (specifically, 2). Since the question asks for the maximum, our interpretation is the correct one to follow.\n*   **Formula for Logical Qubits:** It is crucial to use the correct topological formula, `k = 2g + b - 1`, and correctly identify the genus (`g=0`) and the number of boundaries (`b=3` for each patch).\n*   **Independence of Patches:** The two patches are separate physical systems, so their logical qubits add up.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of logical qubits from the two patches.\n\n<<<4>>>"
