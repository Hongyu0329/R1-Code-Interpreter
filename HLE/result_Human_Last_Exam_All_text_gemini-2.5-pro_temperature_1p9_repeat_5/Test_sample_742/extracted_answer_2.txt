No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics describes physical phenomena and is subject to empirical verification, whereas GÃ¶del's ontological proof is an argument in formal logic dealing with abstract metaphysical concepts. The domains, core concepts, and axioms of the two systems are fundamentally incommensurable, making it impossible to use one to prove the conclusions of the other.
