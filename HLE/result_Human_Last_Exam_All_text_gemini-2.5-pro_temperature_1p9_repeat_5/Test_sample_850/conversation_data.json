    "This question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously: being achiral, being non-polar, and possessing the correct symmetry for optical activity. Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analysis of \"Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity\"**\n\n*   **Definition of Optical Activity:** Optical activity (or optical rotatory power) is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light.\n*   **Fundamental Symmetry Requirement:** The necessary and sufficient condition for a crystal to be optically active is that its structure must be **chiral**.\n*   **Chiral Crystal Classes:** A crystal class (crystallographic point group) is chiral if it lacks any improper rotation axes (Sₙ). This includes a center of inversion (i or -1, which is equivalent to S₂) and mirror planes (m, which is equivalent to S₁).\n*   **List of Chiral Classes:** There are 11 chiral crystal classes that permit optical activity: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432**.\n*   **Conclusion for this condition:** \"Having the correct symmetry for optical activity\" is synonymous with \"being a chiral crystal class\".\n\n**2. Analysis of the \"Achiral\" Condition**\n\n*   **Definition of Achirality:** A crystal class is achiral if it is not chiral.\n*   **Symmetry Elements in Achiral Classes:** An achiral class must possess at least one symmetry element of the second kind (improper rotation axis, Sₙ). This means it will have a center of inversion (i), a mirror plane (m), or axes like -4 (S₄) or -6 (S₃).\n*   **Relationship to Chirality:** By definition, the set of achiral crystal classes and the set of chiral crystal classes are mutually exclusive. A crystal class cannot be both. There are 21 achiral crystal classes.\n\n**3. Identifying the Fundamental Contradiction**\n\n*   The question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral** (from condition one) and also have the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" (from condition three).\n*   As established in Step 1, the symmetry required for optical activity is **chirality**.\n*   Therefore, the question is effectively asking for crystal classes that are simultaneously **achiral and chiral**.\n*   This is a logical contradiction. No crystal class can satisfy both properties.\n\n**4. Analysis of the \"Non-polar\" Condition**\n\n*   **Definition of Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if there is at least one direction in the crystal (a vector) that has no symmetrically equivalent counterpart. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n*   **Definition of Non-polarity:** A crystal class is non-polar if it is not polar. This is true if the class has a center of inversion or if every axis is \"cancelled\" by perpendicular two-fold axes or mirror planes. The remaining 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Impact on the final answer:** This condition acts as a further filter on the list of potential classes. However, since the first and third conditions (\"achiral\" and \"optically active\") are already in direct contradiction, there is no set of classes to filter. The set of classes satisfying both achirality and chirality is empty, so its intersection with the set of non-polar classes must also be empty.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe conditions presented in the question are mutually exclusive. A crystal class must be chiral to be optically active, but the question explicitly asks for achiral classes. Because no crystal class can be both chiral and achiral, no such class exists.\n\n<<<None>>>"
