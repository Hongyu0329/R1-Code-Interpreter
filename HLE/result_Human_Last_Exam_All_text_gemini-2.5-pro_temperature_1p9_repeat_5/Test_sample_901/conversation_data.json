    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry is specified.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. The solvent is the conjugate acid of the base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an elimination reaction over a substitution reaction.\n    *   Specifically, it will be an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction because the base is strong.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Requirements of the E2 Reaction:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry: the hydrogen to be removed (β-hydrogen) and the leaving group (bromine) must be **anti-periplanar**.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the β-hydrogen and the leaving group must both be in **axial** positions and on adjacent carbons.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation of the Product**\n\n**Step 1: Draw the chair conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.**\n\nA cyclohexane ring can exist in two interconverting chair conformations. We must draw both and determine which is more stable.\n\n*   **Conformer A:** Let's draw a chair with the bromine (Br) in an equatorial position and the methyl group (CH₃) also in an equatorial position. We assign priorities to C1 (with Br) and C2 (with CH₃) to confirm the (1S,2R) configuration. In this conformation, the substituents are (1-equatorial, 2-equatorial), which corresponds to a *trans* relationship. Checking the R/S configuration confirms this is indeed the (1S,2R) isomer.\n*   **Conformer B:** Now we perform a ring-flip on Conformer A. The equatorial Br becomes an axial Br, and the equatorial CH₃ becomes an axial CH₃. The substituents are now (1-axial, 2-axial), which is also a *trans* relationship. This is the other conformer of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the most stable (major) conformer.**\n\n*   Substituents on a cyclohexane ring are more stable in the equatorial position to minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions).\n*   **Conformer A** has both the bulky bromine atom and the methyl group in equatorial positions.\n*   **Conformer B** has both groups in axial positions, leading to significant 1,3-diaxial steric strain.\n*   Therefore, **Conformer A (diequatorial) is much more stable** and is the predominant form of the molecule at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the reactive conformer for the E2 reaction.**\n\n*   The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) to be in an **axial** position.\n*   The major conformer (Conformer A) has an equatorial Br. E2 elimination cannot occur from this conformation.\n*   The molecule must first ring-flip into the less stable **Conformer B**, which has an axial Br, for the reaction to proceed. The reaction will proceed through this minor, but reactive, conformer.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the available β-hydrogens for elimination in the reactive conformer.**\n\n*   In Conformer B, the Br is axial on C1. The β-carbons are C2 and C6. We need to look for **axial** hydrogens on these carbons.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position. Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 is in the **equatorial** position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial Br. **Elimination towards C2 cannot occur.**\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar** to the axial bromine on C1.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final product.**\n\n*   Since only the axial hydrogen on C6 can be abstracted by the base (potassium tert-butoxide) in an E2 reaction, elimination can only happen in one direction.\n*   The base abstracts the axial H from C6, a double bond forms between C1 and C6, and the axial Br on C1 leaves.\n*   The resulting alkene product has a double bond between the original C1 and C6 positions, with the methyl group remaining on the original C2.\n\n**Step 6: Name the product.**\n\n*   The product is a methyl-substituted cyclohexene.\n*   To name it via IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the double bond carbons the lowest numbers (1 and 2), and then to give the substituent the lowest possible number.\n*   Numbering the double bond as C1-C2 (where C1 is the original C1 of the reactant) places the methyl group at position 3.\n*   The name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry is Key:** The specific (1S,2R) stereochemistry is crucial. A different stereoisomer (e.g., cis) would have different conformers and potentially lead to a different product.\n2.  **E2 Geometry:** The anti-periplanar requirement for E2 reactions in rings is the most important rule. The leaving group and the hydrogen must both be axial.\n3.  **Reactive Conformer:** The reaction proceeds through the less stable conformer if that is the only one that meets the geometric requirements for the reaction mechanism.\n4.  **Zaitsev vs. Hofmann Rule:** The Zaitsev rule would predict the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene). The Hofmann rule, often applied with bulky bases like t-BuOK, would predict the less substituted alkene (3-methylcyclohexene). In this case, the strict stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction mechanism is the deciding factor and dictates the formation of only 3-methylcyclohexene. Coincidentally, this aligns with the Hofmann prediction.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
