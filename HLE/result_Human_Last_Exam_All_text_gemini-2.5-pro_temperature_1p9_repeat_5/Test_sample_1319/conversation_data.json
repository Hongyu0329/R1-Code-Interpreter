    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Primary Subject:** Mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.\n    *   **Primary Constraint:** Must be a real, \"historical\" mountain that can be identified today.\n    *   **Ranking Criterion:** Physical height (tallest).\n    *   **Exclusion:** Exclude Mount Olympus itself and find the next tallest.\n\n2.  **Identify Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\n    A comprehensive search of the text of the *Iliad* reveals several named mountains or mountainous islands:\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, frequently mentioned. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n    *   **Mount Ida:** Located near Troy (in modern Turkey), it serves as a vantage point for Zeus to watch the war. Its highest peak is specifically named Gargarus.\n    *   **Mount Samothrace:** Poseidon watches the battle from the highest peak of the \"wooded isle of Samothrace.\" This refers to the mountain on the island, a real location.\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** Located in Thessaly, it is mentioned as the source of the wood for Achilles' formidable spear.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned by name during Hera's swift journey from Olympus to Ida. She steps from Athos onto the sea.\n    *   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as a landmark in Lydia, near the homeland of the Maeonian forces allied with the Trojans.\n\n3.  **Find the Elevations of These Historical Mountains**\n    Now we need to find the modern, accepted elevations of these real-world locations to compare them.\n    *   **Mount Olympus (Greece):** 2,918 meters (9,573 feet)\n    *   **Mount Tmolus (Turkey, modern Bozdağ):** 2,159 meters (7,083 feet)\n    *   **Mount Athos (Greece):** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n    *   **Mount Ida (Turkey, modern Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n    *   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n    *   **Mount Samothrace (Peak Fengari, Greece):** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Considerations:**\n    *   It is crucial to differentiate between the two famous Mount Idas of antiquity. The one in Crete (where Zeus was born) is taller than the Trojan Ida but is not the one featured in the *Iliad*. The *Iliad's* Ida is explicitly near Troy.\n    *   While Samothrace is an island, the *Iliad* specifically refers to its \"loftiest peak,\" clearly treating it as a mountain for the purposes of the narrative.\n    *   The mountains are mentioned with varying frequency. Ida and Olympus are central, while Tmolus, Athos, and Pelion have more fleeting references. However, the question is about height, not narrative importance.\n\n5.  **Rank the Mountains by Height and Find the Answer**\n    Let's list the identified mountains from tallest to shortest:\n    1.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m)\n    2.  **Mount Tmolus (2,159 m)**\n    3.  Mount Athos (2,033 m)\n    4.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n    5.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n    6.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n\n    After excluding Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
