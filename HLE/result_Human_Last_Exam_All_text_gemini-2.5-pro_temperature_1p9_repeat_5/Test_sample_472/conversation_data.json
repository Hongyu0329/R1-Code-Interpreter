    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\nThis line is from Plautus and is an **Iambic Senarius**, which consists of six iambic feet (S L). In Plautine comedy, this meter allows for many substitutions.\n\n**Step 1: Syllabification and Vowel Quantities**\nFirst, we determine the natural length of each vowel and identify syllables that are long by position (a vowel followed by two or more consonants, or a double consonant like 'x' or 'z').\n\n*   **et**: The vowel `e` is short, but the syllable is closed by the consonant `t`, making it long by position. (L)\n*   **ti-bi**: The `i` in both syllables is short by nature. (S S)\n*   **be-ne**: The `e` in both syllables is short by nature. (S S)\n*   **es-se**: The first `e` is followed by a double consonant `ss`, making the syllable `es-` long by position. The final `-e` is short by nature. (L S)\n*   **sō-lī**: In `solus` (alone), the `o` is long by nature. The dative ending `-ī` is also long by nature. (L L)\n*   **quom**: This is an old spelling of `cum`. The vowel `u` (written as 'o') is short, but the syllable is closed by `m`, making it long by position. (L)\n*   **si-bi**: Like `tibi`, the `i` in both syllables is short. (S S)\n*   **sit**: The `i` is short, but the syllable is closed by `t`, making it long by position. (L)\n*   **ma-le**: The `a` and the final `e` are both short by nature. (S S)\n\n**Step 2: Elision and Other Prosodic Rules**\nWe look for standard prosodic phenomena.\n\n*   **Elision**: A vowel at the end of a word is usually dropped (elided) when the next word begins with a vowel. Here, the final `-e` of `bene` is elided before the initial `e-` of `esse`. The line is pronounced as if written `...ben' esse...`.\n*   ***Brevis in longo***: The final syllable of any Latin verse can be treated as long, regardless of its natural quantity. Here, the final syllable `-le` is short but will function as a long syllable to complete the final foot.\n\n**Step 3: Division into Feet**\nWe divide the line into six feet, keeping the rules of the iambic senarius in mind. A good strategy is to scan from the end of the line, as it is often more regular.\n\n*   **Foot 6**: The last two syllables are `ma-le`. The scansion is S S. Due to *brevis in longo*, the final `-le` is treated as long. This forms a perfect **iamb** (S L).\n    *   `male` -> S L\n\n*   **Foot 5**: The three syllables before `male` are `si-bi sit`. The quantities are S S L. This forms a perfect **anapest** (S S L), a common substitution for an iamb.\n    *   `sibi sit` -> S S L\n\n*   **Foot 4**: The two syllables before `sibi sit` are `-lī quom`. Both syllables are long (`-lī` from `soli` and `quom`). This forms a **spondee** (L L), another valid substitution.\n    *   `lī quom` -> L L\n\n*   **Foot 3**: Before `-lī`, we have the syllable `sō-` from `soli`. Before that is the last syllable of `esse`, which is `-se` (S). So the syllables are `-se sō-`. This forms a perfect **iamb** (S L).\n    *   `se sō-` -> S L\n\n*   **Foot 2**: We are now left with the beginning of the line: `et tibi ben(e) es-`. We've used `-se` from `esse`. What's left from that phrase are the syllables `be-` (from `bene`, after elision) and `es-` (from `esse`). The quantities are S L. This forms another perfect **iamb** (S L).\n    *   `ben(e) es-` -> S L\n\n*   **Foot 1**: The only syllables remaining are `et tibi`. The quantities are L S S. This forms a **dactyl** (L S S). This is a less common but valid substitution in comedy, typically seen as a spondee (L L) where the second long syllable is \"resolved\" into two shorts (L -> S S).\n    *   `et tibi` -> L S S\n\n**Step 4: Final Assembly**\nPutting the feet together, we get the complete scansion of the line:\n\n`et ti-bi | ben' es- | se sō- | lī quom | si-bi sit | ma-le`\nL S S | S L | S L | L L | S S L | S L\n\nThe result is a valid Plautine iambic senarius with substitutions in feet 1, 4, and 5.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
