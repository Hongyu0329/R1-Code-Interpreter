    "Answering this question requires analyzing the properties of \"filled\" groups and applying them to the specific class of groups of order $2q^m$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A non-empty subset $S$ of a group $G$ is product-free if for any two elements $a, b \\in S$ (not necessarily distinct), their product $ab$ is not in $S$. This can be written as $S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPS):** A product-free set $S$ is a MIPS if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means that for any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group $G$ is called \"filled\" if every MIPS in $G$ generates $G$ (i.e., $\\langle S \\rangle = G$ for every MIPS $S$).\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find all nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number ($m \\ge 1$), that are filled.\n\n**Step 2: A Key Characterization of Filled Groups**\n\nA crucial theorem, established for finite solvable groups, provides an algebraic characterization of filled groups. A group of order $p^a r^b$ (like our $2^1 q^m$) is always solvable by Burnside's Theorem. The theorem states:\n\n*   **Theorem (Main, Smith, Saccoman):** A finite solvable group $G$ is filled if and only if its Frattini quotient, $G/\\Phi(G)$, is a cyclic group.\n\nHere, $\\Phi(G)$ is the Frattini subgroup of $G$, defined as the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $G$. This theorem turns our combinatorial problem into an algebraic one.\n\n**Step 3: Structure of Groups of Order 2q^m**\n\nLet $G$ be a nonabelian group of order $|G|=2q^m$ with $q$ being an odd prime.\n*   By Sylow's Theorems, let $n_q$ be the number of Sylow $q$-subgroups. We know $n_q \\mid 2$ and $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}$.\n*   If $n_q=2$, then $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}$, which means $q \\mid 1$. This is impossible for a prime $q$.\n*   Therefore, $n_q=1$. This means the Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $Q$, is unique and hence normal in $G$. $|Q| = q^m$.\n*   Let $P$ be a Sylow 2-subgroup. $|P|=2$, so $P \\cong C_2$.\n*   Since $Q$ is normal, $G$ is a semidirect product $G = Q \\rtimes P$.\n*   Since $G$ is nonabelian, the semidirect product must be non-trivial. This means there is a non-trivial homomorphism $\\phi: P \\to \\text{Aut}(Q)$. Let $P=\\langle x \\rangle$ with $x^2=e$. The homomorphism is determined by the automorphism $\\alpha = \\phi(x) \\in \\text{Aut}(Q)$, which must have order 2.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Frattini Subgroup Φ(G)**\n\nTo check if $G/\\Phi(G)$ is cyclic, we first need to understand $\\Phi(G)$.\n1.  Let's consider the quotient group $G/Q \\cong P \\cong C_2$. The Frattini subgroup of $C_2$ is trivial, $\\Phi(C_2) = \\{e\\}$.\n2.  A theorem by Gaschütz states that if $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $\\Phi(G)N/N \\le \\Phi(G/N)$.\n3.  Applying this with $N=Q$, we get $\\Phi(G)Q/Q \\le \\Phi(G/Q) = \\{e\\}$. This implies $\\Phi(G)Q = Q$, which means $\\Phi(G)$ must be a subgroup of $Q$.\n4.  Another result, by Stitzinger, states that for any $p$-solvable group $G$, $\\Phi(O_p(G)) = O_p(\\Phi(G))$, where $O_p(G)$ is the largest normal $p$-subgroup of $G$. Our group $G$ is solvable, hence $q$-solvable. For our group, $O_q(G) = Q$.\n5.  Thus, $\\Phi(Q) = O_q(\\Phi(G))$.\n6.  From point 3, we know $\\Phi(G)$ is a subgroup of $Q$, which is a $q$-group. Therefore, $\\Phi(G)$ is a $q$-group. The largest normal $q$-subgroup of a $q$-group is the group itself. So, $O_q(\\Phi(G)) = \\Phi(G)$.\n7.  Combining points 5 and 6, we arrive at a critical simplification: $\\Phi(G) = \\Phi(Q)$.\n\n**Step 5: Applying the Cyclicity Condition**\n\nOur condition for $G$ to be filled becomes: $G/\\Phi(Q)$ must be cyclic.\n*   $G/\\Phi(Q) = (Q \\rtimes P)/\\Phi(Q)$. Since $\\Phi(Q)$ is a characteristic subgroup of $Q$ and $Q$ is normal in $G$, $\\Phi(Q)$ is normal in $G$. The quotient is isomorphic to $(Q/\\Phi(Q)) \\rtimes P$.\n*   For the semidirect product $(Q/\\Phi(Q)) \\rtimes P$ to be cyclic, two conditions must be met:\n    1.  It must be abelian. This requires the action of $P$ on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ to be trivial.\n    2.  The resulting direct product $(Q/\\Phi(Q)) \\times P$ must be cyclic.\n\nLet's analyze these two conditions.\n\n**Condition 2: $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ must be cyclic**\n*   By the Burnside Basis Theorem, for a $p$-group $K$, the quotient $K/\\Phi(K)$ is an elementary abelian $p$-group, and its rank is the minimum number of generators for $K$.\n*   For $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ to be cyclic, its rank must be 1. This happens if and only if $Q$ itself is a cyclic group.\n*   This significantly restricts our search. $Q$ must be isomorphic to $C_{q^m}$.\n*   If $Q \\cong C_{q^m}$, we need to find the non-trivial automorphisms $\\alpha$ of order 2. The automorphism group $\\text{Aut}(C_{q^m})$ is abelian and has order $\\phi(q^m) = q^{m-1}(q-1)$. Since $q$ is odd, $q-1$ is even, so there exists a unique element of order 2. This is the inversion map $\\alpha(u) = u^{-1}$ for all $u \\in Q$.\n*   Therefore, the only possible nonabelian group structures with a cyclic Sylow $q$-subgroup are the dihedral groups $G = D_{2q^m}$.\n\n**Condition 1: The action of P on Q/Φ(Q) must be trivial**\n*   We now test this condition for $G = D_{2q^m}$.\n*   Here, $Q = \\langle a \\mid a^{q^m}=e \\rangle \\cong C_{q^m}$, and $P = \\langle x \\mid x^2=e \\rangle$. The action is $xax^{-1} = a^{-1}$.\n*   The Frattini subgroup of $Q$ is $\\Phi(Q) = Q^q = \\{u^q \\mid u \\in Q\\} = \\langle a^q \\rangle$.\n*   The action of $P$ (specifically, of $x$) on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ is trivial if for every element $\\bar{u} = u\\Phi(Q)$ in $Q/\\Phi(Q)$, we have $x\\bar{u}x^{-1} = \\bar{u}$.\n*   This is equivalent to $u^{-1}\\Phi(Q) = u\\Phi(Q)$, which means $u^2 \\in \\Phi(Q)$ for all $u \\in Q$.\n*   Let's check this for the generator $u=a$. We need $a^2 \\in \\Phi(Q) = \\langle a^q \\rangle$.\n*   The element $a^2$ generates a subgroup $\\langle a^2 \\rangle$. Since $q$ is an odd prime, $\\gcd(2, q^m)=1$, so the order of $a^2$ is $q^m$. This means $\\langle a^2 \\rangle = \\langle a \\rangle = Q$.\n*   The subgroup $\\langle a^q \\rangle$ has order $q^{m-1}$.\n*   For the condition $a^2 \\in \\langle a^q \\rangle$ to hold, the group $\\langle a^2 \\rangle$ must be a subgroup of $\\langle a^q \\rangle$.\n*   This would mean $Q \\subseteq \\langle a^q \\rangle$. But this is impossible, since $|Q| = q^m$ and $|\\langle a^q \\rangle| = q^{m-1}$ (and $m \\ge 1$).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe found that for a nonabelian group $G$ of order $2q^m$ to be filled, its Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ must be cyclic, which forces $G$ to be a dihedral group $D_{2q^m}$. However, for $D_{2q^m}$, the condition that $G/\\Phi(G)$ is cyclic is never met because the action of the order-2 element on the Frattini quotient of $Q$ is non-trivial. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, there are no nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$ (for odd prime $q$ and $m \\ge 1$) that are filled. The set of such groups is empty.\n\n<<<The set of such groups is empty.>>>"
