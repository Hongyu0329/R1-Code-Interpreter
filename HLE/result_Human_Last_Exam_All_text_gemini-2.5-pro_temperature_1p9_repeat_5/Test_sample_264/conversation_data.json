    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Coordinate System and the First Cube**\nLet's place the first cube, Cube A, in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can align its edges with the axes and place one of its vertices at the origin (0, 0, 0).\nSince the side length is 1, Cube A occupies the region defined by the inequalities:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Main Diagonal\"**\nA main diagonal of a cube connects two opposite vertices. For the cube we've defined, there are four main diagonals. The most convenient one to work with is the one connecting the origin (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this main diagonal is **d** = <1, 1, 1>. Due to the symmetry of the cube, the choice of main diagonal will not affect the final volume of the intersection.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the Shift**\nThe second cube, Cube B, is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to Cube A. This statement can be ambiguous, so let's analyze the most plausible interpretation in a mathematical context.\n*   **Interpretation A: The shift *distance* is 1/2.** This would mean the cube is moved by a distance of 1/2 in the direction of the main diagonal vector <1, 1, 1>. The shift vector would be <s, s, s> where the length √(s² + s² + s²) = 1/2. This leads to s = 1/(2√3), a non-trivial value.\n*   **Interpretation B: The shift *vector* is 1/2 of the main diagonal vector.** This means the shift vector is v = (1/2) * **d** = (1/2) * <1, 1, 1> = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>.\n\nInterpretation B is much more common for problems of this nature. It leads to a clean, symmetrical arrangement where the vertex (0, 0, 0) of the shifted cube lands on the center (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) of the original cube. This suggests it is the intended meaning. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n**Step 4: Define the Second Cube**\nCube B is simply Cube A translated by the shift vector **v** = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>. To find the region occupied by Cube B, we apply this shift to the inequalities of Cube A. A point (x, y, z) is in Cube B if the point (x - 1/2, y - 1/2, z - 1/2) is in Cube A.\nThis gives the inequalities for Cube B:\n*   0 ≤ x - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n*   0 ≤ y - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n*   0 ≤ z - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n**Step 5: Find the Region of Intersection**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the volume where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We combine the sets of inequalities for each coordinate.\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these two intervals is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n\nThe region of intersection is a rectangular prism (specifically, a cube) defined by:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe shape of the intersection is a cube. We can find its side length from the ranges calculated in the previous step.\n*   Side length = (upper bound - lower bound) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\nThe volume of this smaller cube is the side length cubed.\n*   Volume = (Side Length)³ = (1/2)³ = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Placement of the First Cube:** Placing the first cube at the origin with edges along the axes is the simplest setup.\n2.  **Ambiguity of the \"Shift\":** The most critical point is interpreting the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\" As analyzed, interpreting this as a shift vector of <1/2, 1/2, 1/2> is standard for such problems and leads to a symmetrical configuration and a simple answer, which is a strong indicator of the correct path.\n3.  **Intersection of Intervals:** When finding the intersection of two regions, the intersection of the bounds for each coordinate must be calculated independently. For intervals [a, b] and [c, d], the intersection is [max(a, c), min(b, d)].\n4.  **Final Shape:** The intersection of two cubes whose faces are parallel is always a rectangular prism (or empty). In this case, the symmetrical shift results in the intersection being a perfect cube.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
