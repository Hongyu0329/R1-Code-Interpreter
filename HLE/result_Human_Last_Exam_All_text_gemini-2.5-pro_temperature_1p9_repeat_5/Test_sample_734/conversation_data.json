    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific Christian theologian who satisfies several criteria:\n1.  They must be a **Christian theologian**.\n2.  They must have been the **first** to do this.\n3.  They must have developed **specialized terminology**.\n4.  This terminology must be able to describe **changes in the laws of nature**.\n5.  This framework must be applicable to two distinct theological events:\n    *   **The virgin birth of Jesus** (a specific miracle).\n    *   **Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall** (a systemic change in the natural order).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates and Their Core Ideas**\nSeveral major theologians have dealt with miracles and natural law. We need to evaluate them against the criteria, paying special attention to \"first\" and \"specialized terminology.\"\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–1274):** Aquinas is famous for his detailed philosophical theology. He developed the distinction between God's **ordained power (*potentia ordinata*)** and God's **absolute power (*potentia absoluta*)**. The laws of nature are the expression of God's *ordained power*—the usual way He runs the universe. A miracle, like the virgin birth, is an act of God's *absolute power*, doing something outside the normal established order. The changes at the Fall could be seen as God instituting a new *ordained order*. While this is specialized terminology, Aquinas lived in the 13th century, so we must check if anyone earlier fits the description.\n\n*   **C.S. Lewis (1898–1963):** In his book *Miracles*, Lewis argues that miracles are not violations of nature but rather the intervention of the Supernatural into the natural order. God, as the author of the story of creation, can write new paragraphs into it. While a powerful modern apologist, he is not the *first* to develop such concepts and often builds on earlier thinkers.\n\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** Augustine lived much earlier than Aquinas. In his writings, particularly *The Literal Meaning of Genesis* (*De Genesi ad litteram*), he developed a sophisticated concept to reconcile Genesis with observations about nature and miracles. He adapted the Stoic idea of *logoi spermatikoi* into his own Christian theological term: ***rationes seminales*** (Latin for \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles\").\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Augustine's Terminology (*Rationes Seminales*) against the Question's Criteria**\n1.  **Christian Theologian:** Yes, Augustine is one of the most influential theologians in Western Christianity.\n2.  **First:** Living in the 4th-5th centuries, he predates other key figures like Aquinas by over 800 years. While he adapted a concept from Stoicism, he was the first major Christian theologian to integrate it into a comprehensive system for this specific purpose.\n3.  **Specialized Terminology:** Yes, *rationes seminales* is a specific, technical term from his writings.\n4.  **Describes Changes in Laws of Nature:** Augustine proposed that God created everything at the beginning \"invisibly, latently, causally\"—like seeds. The \"laws of nature\" are simply these seeds unfolding in their normal, established temporal sequence. A \"change\" in these laws can be explained within this system.\n5.  **Application to the Virgin Birth and the Fall:**\n    *   **Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, a miracle like the virgin birth is not God violating his own natural laws. Instead, it is God, the Creator of the seminal reasons, causing a \"seed\" (the potential for Christ's human body) to develop directly, bypassing the usual temporal process of sexual reproduction. It is contrary to the *known* course of nature, but not to the deeper potential God embedded in creation.\n    *   **Alterations at the Fall:** Augustine's framework is also perfectly suited to describe changes at the Fall. He argued that before the Fall, humanity was able to avoid death (*posse non mori*). After the Fall, death became inevitable (*non posse non mori*). This shift, along with the appearance of thorns and thistles (Genesis 3:18), can be explained as the \"activation\" of specific *rationes seminales* of decay, corruption, and hardship. These potentials were part of God's creation in his foreknowledge of the Fall, but they only became active and part of the manifest natural order as a consequence of sin.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nAugustine of Hippo fits all the criteria perfectly. He was the first major Christian theologian to create a specialized terminology (*rationes seminales*) that provided a coherent framework for understanding how both singular miracles (the virgin birth) and systemic shifts in the natural order (the Fall) could occur without making God seem arbitrary or as if He were violating his own nature. He saw these events not as violations of nature, but as the unfolding of deeper potentials that God had woven into the fabric of creation from the very beginning.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
