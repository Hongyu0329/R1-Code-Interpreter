    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Work:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action:** A character visits a Roman city.\n    *   **Specifics of the Visit:** The character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description is recognizable to the reader as a reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus, who were suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Themes and Characters:**\n    *   The novel centers on a Gothic tribe, the \"Wolfings,\" preparing to fight an invading Roman army. The name \"Wolfing\" is significant, as they believe they are descended from a divine wolf ancestor.\n    *   The protagonist is **Thiodolf**, the War-Duke of the Wolfings. He is the central figure who must lead his people.\n    *   A critical part of Thiodolf's backstory is that he is not a simple tribesman. He has a more complex past that connects him to the Roman world.\n\n3.  **Connect the Character to the Action:**\n    *   The main action of the novel takes place in Mirkwood, the homeland of the Goths, so the visit to the Roman city is not part of the present narrative. It must be a memory or a story told by one of the characters.\n    *   We need to identify which character has the backstory necessary to have visited a Roman city and witnessed its culture. Thiodolf spent part of his youth away from his tribe and even served for a time in the Roman army, making him the only character with firsthand experience of Roman life.\n\n4.  **Locate the Specific Scene:**\n    *   In Chapter VI, \"Thiodolf telleth the Men of the Wolfings concerning the Romans,\" Thiodolf gives a speech to his people to prepare them for the coming battle.\n    *   In this speech, he recounts his time living among the Romans. He aims to explain the nature of their enemy, demystify them, and also point out their contradictions.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Description of Religious Practices:**\n    *   During his speech, Thiodolf describes a great city he saw. He tells his kinsmen that the Romans, who are now their enemies, also hold a wolf in high regard.\n    *   He explicitly describes seeing a bronze image of \"**a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children**.\"\n    *   This description is an unmistakable reference to the Capitoline Wolf (Lupa Capitolina), the famous bronze sculpture depicting the she-wolf nursing the twin founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The character who fits all the criteria is Thiodolf.\n    *   He is the one who has been to a Roman city.\n    *   He recounts what he saw in a speech to his people.\n    *   His description perfectly matches the myth of Romulus and Remus, highlighting the irony that both the Wolfings and their Roman enemies share a wolf as a foundational, revered figure.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is therefore the name of this character.\n\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
