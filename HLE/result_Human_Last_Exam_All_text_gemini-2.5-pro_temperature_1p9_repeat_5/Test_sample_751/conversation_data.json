    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem asks to reduce a given discrete-time system to its observer canonical form using the principle of duality. The system is defined by matrices A and C. We are asked to find the new output matrix, let's call it `C_o`.\n\n**Original System:**\n$x(k+1) = Ax(k)$\n$y(k) = Cx(k)$\n\nwith\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, $C = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**1. Understand Duality and Observer Canonical Form**\n\nThe principle of duality in control theory states that a system `(A, C)` is observable if and only if its dual system, `(A^T, C^T)`, is controllable. The transformation that converts a system to observer canonical form is the dual of the transformation that converts its dual system to controller canonical form.\n\nAn observable system can be transformed into observer canonical form by a similarity transformation $x = T\\hat{x}$, where T is an invertible transformation matrix. The new state-space representation becomes:\n$\\hat{x}(k+1) = T^{-1}AT \\hat{x}(k) = A_o \\hat{x}(k)$\n$y(k) = CT \\hat{x}(k) = C_o \\hat{x}(k)$\n\nOur goal is to find `C_o`. The structure of `C_o` will be very simple, typically with single '1's in each row and zeros elsewhere, corresponding to the observability indices of the system.\n\n**2. The Duality-Based Method**\n\nInstead of directly transforming the dual system, we can use a method that is conceptually dual to the controller form transformation. This involves constructing the transformation matrix `T` (or its inverse, `T^{-1}`) from the rows of the observability matrix.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Check Observability.** Before we can transform to observer canonical form, we must confirm the system is observable. For a multi-output system, we check if we can find `n` (where `n=3` is the state dimension) linearly independent rows by inspecting the rows of `C`, `CA`, `CA^2`, etc.\n\nLet the rows of C be `c_1` and `c_2`:\n$c_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$c_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThese two vectors are linearly independent. Now we compute `c_1 A` and `c_2 A`:\n$c_1 A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet's check if the set of vectors $\\{c_1, c_2, c_1 A\\}$ is linearly independent. We can form a matrix with these vectors as rows and check its determinant:\nMatrix $Q = \\begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\\\ c_1 A \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$det(Q) = 0 \\cdot (...) - 1 \\cdot (1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 2) + 0 \\cdot (...) = -1(1) = -1$\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the three vectors are linearly independent and form a basis for the 3D state space. The system is observable.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Choosing the transformation.** The choice of these basis vectors is the core of the method. The fact that we have selected `n=3` linearly independent vectors means the system is observable, and these vectors can be used to construct the transformation matrix. The choice to stop at `c_1 A` implies the observability indices are `v_1=2` (from `c_1, c_1 A`) and `v_2=1` (from `c_2`).\n\n**3. Construct the Transformation Matrix**\n\nWe define the inverse of the transformation matrix, $T^{-1}$, using the basis vectors we found. A standard choice for creating a particular canonical form is to arrange the basis vectors as follows (other orderings result in different but valid canonical forms):\n$T^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} c_1 A \\\\ c_2 \\\\ c_1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet's use another common choice which often yields a simpler `C_o`. Let's re-order them:\n$T^{-1} = Q = \\begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_1 A \\\\ c_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**4. Calculate the New Output Matrix `C_o`**\n\nThe new output matrix is given by $C_o = CT$. Since we have constructed $T^{-1}$, we need to compute $T = (T^{-1})^{-1}$. The equation becomes $C_o = C (T^{-1})^{-1} = C Q^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, find the inverse of $Q = T^{-1}$:\n$det(Q) = det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -1 \\cdot det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -1(0 - 1) = 1$\n\nThe matrix of cofactors is:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe adjugate (or adjoint) matrix is the transpose of the cofactor matrix:\n$adj(Q) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*Error in calculation during thought process. Let's recompute.*\n$C_{11}=+(0-1)=-1$, $C_{12}=-(0-1)=1$, $C_{13}=+(2-1)=1$\n$C_{21}=-(0-0)=0$, $C_{22}=+(0-0)=0$, $C_{23}=-(0-1)=1$\n$C_{31}=+(1-0)=1$, $C_{32}=-(0-0)=0$, $C_{33}=+(0-2)=-2$\nCofactor Matrix = $\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}$\nAdjugate Matrix = (Cofactor Matrix)$^T$ = $\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSo, $Q^{-1} = \\frac{1}{det(Q)} adj(Q) = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we can compute `C_o`:\n$C_o = C Q^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$C_o = \\begin{bmatrix} (0 \\cdot -1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1) & (0 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1) & (0 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot -2) \\\\ (1 \\cdot -1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1) & (1 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1) & (1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot -2) \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n$C_o = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThis is a valid structure for an observer canonical form output matrix.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The result depends on the ordering of basis vectors.** If we had chosen a different ordering for the rows of $T^{-1}$, the resulting `C_o` matrix would also be different, though it would still be in a canonical form (e.g., columns might be permuted). The specific choice of `T^{-1} = [c_1; c_1 A; c_2]` leads to this result.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  **System and Goal:** Reduce $(A, C)$ to observer canonical form and find the new `C_o`.\n2.  **Duality Method:** Use the rows of `C` and `CA` to check observability and construct the transformation matrix $T^{-1}$.\n3.  **Basis Selection:** Select linearly independent rows $c_1 = [0, 1, 0]$, $c_2 = [1, 1, 0]$, and $c_1A = [2, 1, 1]$.\n4.  **Transformation Matrix:** Construct $T^{-1} = Q = [c_1; c_1 A; c_2]^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n5.  **Matrix Inversion:** Calculate $Q^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Compute $C_o = C Q^{-1}$.\n$C_o = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe final value for the new matrix C is $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
