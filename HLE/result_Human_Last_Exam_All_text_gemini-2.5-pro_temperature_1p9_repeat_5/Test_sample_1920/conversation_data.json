    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$:\n$d = 53599$\nWe can test for small prime factors:\n$53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n$7657 = 13 \\times 589$\n$589 = 19 \\times 31$\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor is a product of four distinct odd primes.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet character**\nAccording to the structure theorem for Dirichlet characters, a character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime factor $p_i$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the condition of primitivity**\nA character $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$ is primitive with conductor $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_p$ is primitive modulo its respective prime $p$.\nFor a character $\\psi$ modulo a prime $p$, its conductor is $p$ (i.e., it is primitive) if and only if it is not the trivial character (the character that maps all elements to 1). The trivial character has conductor 1.\nThus, for $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, none of the characters $\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31}$ can be the trivial character. This is equivalent to saying that the order of each character $\\chi_p$, denoted by $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be greater than 1.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the order of the character**\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the conditions and count the possibilities**\nLet $o_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. From the lcm condition, each $o_p$ must be a divisor of 6. So, $o_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\nFrom the primitivity condition, $o_p > 1$.\nCombining these, the order of each component character $o_p$ must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nNext, we need to count how many characters of these orders exist for each prime modulus. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. In a cyclic group of order $n$, the number of elements of order $k$ (for $k|n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n\nLet's check if orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible for our primes:\n*   For $p=7$, $\\phi(7) = 6$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 6, characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $p=13$, $\\phi(13) = 12$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 12, characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $p=19$, $\\phi(19) = 18$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 18, characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $p=31$, $\\phi(31) = 30$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 30, characters of these orders exist.\n\nFor each of the four primes $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the number of component characters of a specific order is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nSo, for each of the four component characters, we have $1+2+2 = 5$ choices, where the order can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\n**Step 6: Final combinatorial calculation**\nWe need to form a 4-tuple of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ where each $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and their lcm is exactly 6. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1.  **Total number of combinations where orders are in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$**:\n    For each of the 4 prime factors, there are 5 possible characters.\n    Total combinations = $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n2.  **Subtract combinations where the lcm is NOT 6**:\n    If all orders are chosen from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, the lcm can be 2, 3, or 6. We must exclude the cases where the lcm is 2 or 3.\n    *   **Case A: lcm is 2**. This happens if and only if all component characters have order 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n        Number of such combinations = $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n    *   **Case B: lcm is 3**. This happens if and only if all component characters have order 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n        Number of such combinations = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe two cases are mutually exclusive. So, the number of valid combinations is the total minus the invalid ones.\nNumber of primitive characters of order 6 = (Total combinations) - (Combinations with lcm=2) - (Combinations with lcm=3)\nNumber = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$."
