    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe observe that the terms can be grouped and factored:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\nSo the roots of $f(x)$ are the roots of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and the roots of $h(x) = x^2 - 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their splitting fields**\n1.  **For $h(x) = x^2 - 2$:** The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of degree $[E:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. Its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n2.  **For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    *   **Irreducibility:** We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (0 for $x^4$, 0 for $x^2$, -9 for $x^1$, 3 for $x^0$) are divisible by 3. The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Therefore, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois Group:** Let $F$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $G_g = \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$. Since $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, $G_g$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$, and its order is a multiple of 5. Thus, $G_g$ must contain an element of order 5 (a 5-cycle).\n    *   To find the number of real roots of $g(x)$, we analyze its derivative: $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x^4 = 9/5$, so $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two real critical points, which means $g(x)$ has at most three real roots.\n        Let's evaluate $g(x)$ at these points. Let $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n        The local minimum is at $x=x_0$: $g(x_0) = x_0^5 - 9x_0 + 3 = x_0(x_0^4) - 9x_0 + 3 = x_0(9/5) - 9x_0 + 3 = 3 - (36/5)x_0$. Since $x_0>0$, this value is negative.\n        The local maximum is at $x=-x_0$: $g(-x_0) = -x_0^5 + 9x_0 + 3 = -(x_0^5 - 9x_0 - 3) = -g(x_0) + 6$, which is positive.\n        Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots.\n    *   As a degree 5 polynomial, $g(x)$ must have $5-3=2$ non-real complex roots, which must be a conjugate pair. The complex conjugation automorphism acts as a transposition on the set of roots.\n    *   A subgroup of $S_5$ that contains a 5-cycle and a transposition must be $S_5$ itself. So, $G_g = \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of this extension is $[F:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the splitting field K and its Galois group**\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the smallest field containing all roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. This is the compositum of the fields $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $F$. Thus, $K = F(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K:F][F:\\mathbb{Q}]$. The degree $[K:F]$ is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $\\sqrt{2} \\in F$.\n\nTo check if $\\sqrt{2} \\in F$, we can examine the quadratic subfields of $F$. A subfield corresponds to a subgroup of $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) = S_5$. A quadratic subfield corresponds to a normal subgroup of index 2. The only normal subgroup of $S_5$ with index 2 is the alternating group $A_5$. Thus, $F$ has a unique quadratic subfield. This subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe discriminant is $D = (-1)^{5(4)/2}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (1-5)^4(-9)^5) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nSince $D < 0$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field. On the other hand, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies $\\sqrt{2} \\notin F$.\n\nSo, $[K:F] = 2$. The total degree of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K:F][F:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\nSince $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ and $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ are both normal extensions and their intersection is $F \\cap E = \\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of their Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Find all possible degrees of intermediate normal extensions**\nWe are looking for all possible degrees of field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ and $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal.\nBy the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, these extensions $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H]$. We need to find all possible values for the index $[G:H]$.\n\nLet's list the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}, C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ include:\n1.  **Product of normal subgroups:** $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\triangleleft S_5$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft C_2$.\n    *   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H| = 60 \\times 1 = 60$. Index $[G:H] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H| = 120 \\times 1 = 120$. Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H| = 1 \\times 2 = 2$. Index $[G:H] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H| = 60 \\times 2 = 120$. Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **\"Twisted\" or \"diagonal\" normal subgroups:** These exist if there is a common quotient group between the factors. Here, $S_5$ has a normal subgroup $A_5$ with quotient $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. This is isomorphic to $C_2/\\{e\\}$. This allows for another normal subgroup.\n    *   Let $\\text{sgn}: S_5 \\to C_2$ be the sign homomorphism (where $C_2 \\cong \\{1, -1\\}$). The subgroup $H_{diag} = \\{(s,t) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(s) = t\\}$ is a normal subgroup of $S_5 \\times C_2$.\n    *   The elements of this subgroup are pairs $(s, \\text{sgn}(s))$. The number of such elements where $\\text{sgn}(s)=1$ is $|A_5|=60$. The number of elements where $\\text{sgn}(s)=-1$ is $|S_5 \\setminus A_5|=60$.\n    *   The order of this subgroup is $|H| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    *   The index is $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nCollecting all the possible indices for proper, non-trivial normal subgroups:\n*   Index 2 (from $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, $A_5 \\times C_2$, and $H_{diag}$)\n*   Index 4 (from $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$)\n*   Index 120 (from $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$)\n\nThe set of all possible degrees for such field extensions $L$ is therefore {2, 4, 120}.\n\nThe corresponding fields are:\n*   **Degree 2:** $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D})$.\n*   **Degree 4:** $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D})$.\n*   **Degree 120:** The splitting field $F$ of $x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\nAll these degrees are possible for normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$."
