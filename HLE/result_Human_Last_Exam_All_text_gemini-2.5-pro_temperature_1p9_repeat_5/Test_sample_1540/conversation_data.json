    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most memory-efficient C program for the described problem and calculate the total memory used for its variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective**: Compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n2.  **Input**: Two lines, each containing a string.\n3.  **Constraints**:\n    *   Strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n    *   Strings have the same length.\n    *   String length is between 1 and 100, inclusive.\n4.  **Comparison Logic**:\n    *   The comparison is case-insensitive. 'a' is equivalent to 'A'.\n    *   Comparison proceeds character by character from left to right.\n    *   The result is determined by the first pair of characters that are not equivalent.\n5.  **Output**:\n    *   `-1` if string1 < string2.\n    *   `1` if string1 > string2.\n    *   `0` if string1 == string2.\n\n### Careful Points for Implementation\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitivity**: When comparing `char c1` and `char c2`, they must first be converted to a common case. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is suitable for this.\n2.  **Memory Efficiency**: This is the primary goal. We need to minimize the amount of memory allocated for variables. The most common source of memory usage in this problem is the buffers used to store the input strings.\n3.  **Input Handling**: Standard input (`stdin`) is a sequential stream. The first string is followed by a newline, then the second string. To compare the strings character by character (`s1[i]` vs `s2[i]`), we must have access to `s1[i]` while reading `s2[i]`. This means the first string *must* be stored in memory (buffered).\n4.  **Optimizing Buffers**: A naive approach would be to declare two character arrays, `char s1[101]` and `char s2[101]`, and read both strings using `scanf`. This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes for buffers alone. A more memory-efficient method is to store only the first string and then read the second string one character at a time, comparing it against the stored first string on the fly. This eliminates the need for the second buffer.\n5.  **Variable Data Types**: To further minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible standard C data types for all variables.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Designing the Optimal Program and Calculating Memory\n\nWe will design a solution that uses the optimized input strategy (one buffer + `getchar()`) and minimal data types.\n\n**Variables Required:**\n\n1.  **First String Buffer (`s1`)**: To store the first string. Since the maximum length is 100, we need an array of size 101 to also accommodate the null terminator `\\0`.\n    *   Declaration: `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory Usage: `101 * sizeof(char) = 101 * 1 byte = 101 bytes`.\n\n2.  **Character Input Variable (`c`)**: We will use `getchar()` to read the second string character by character. `getchar()` returns an `int` so it can represent all possible `char` values plus the distinct `EOF` (End-Of-File) marker. Therefore, the variable storing its return value must be an `int`.\n    *   Declaration: `int c;`\n    *   Memory Usage: `sizeof(int) = 4 bytes` (on typical competitive programming platforms).\n\n3.  **Index Variable (`i`)**: We need an index to iterate through the strings. The index will go from 0 up to a maximum of 100. A single-byte integer type is sufficient. `signed char` (range -128 to 127) is the smallest standard type that can serve this purpose.\n    *   Declaration: `signed char i;`\n    *   Memory Usage: `sizeof(signed char) = 1 byte`.\n\n4.  **Result Variable (`result`)**: This variable stores the outcome: -1, 0, or 1. Again, `signed char` is the smallest standard data type that can hold these values.\n    *   Declaration: `signed char result;`\n    *   Memory Usage: `sizeof(signed char) = 1 byte`.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (`m`):**\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all these variables. These variables would be allocated on the stack frame of the `main` function.\n\n`m = (memory for s1) + (memory for c) + (memory for i) + (memory for result)`\n`m = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte`\n`m = 107 bytes`\n\nThis solution is the most memory-efficient because it avoids a second large buffer and uses the smallest possible data types for auxiliary variables, respecting the requirements of standard C functions like `getchar()`.\n\n<<<107>>>"
