Based on an analysis of protein structures and mutagenesis data, the following specific amino acid residues in the human beta-1 subunit (CACNB1) are considered hotspots:

**1) Hotspots for Interaction (Binding) with the alpha-1 subunit:**
These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain and form the AID-Binding Pocket (ABP), which is essential for high-affinity physical binding to the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID). The positions are for the canonical human isoform (UniProt P54283).
*   **Tyrosine 357 (Y357):** Forms a crucial hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction.
*   **Glutamate 398 (E398):** Participates in electrostatic interactions.
*   **Methionine 404 (M404):** Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket.
*   **Valine 408 (V408):** Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket.
*   **Isoleucine 448 (I448):** Lines the hydrophobic pocket.
*   **Phenylalanine 452 (F452):** Lines the hydrophobic pocket.

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**
These residues or regions modulate the channel's biophysical behavior (opening, closing, inactivating) and may function independently of their role in binding affinity.

*   **For modulating inactivation kinetics:**
    *   **Cysteine 3 (C3) and Cysteine 4 (C4):** In the N-terminus of the Î²1b splice variant, these sites are palmitoylated. This lipid modification is critical for the subunit's ability to induce rapid channel inactivation.

*   **For modulating the voltage-dependence of activation:**
    *   **Residues 422-428 (KFGKFPK):** This loop within the GK domain, but separate from the primary binding pocket, is a key determinant for shifting the voltage range over which the channel activates. Altering this loop changes the channel's voltage sensitivity without necessarily disrupting binding.
