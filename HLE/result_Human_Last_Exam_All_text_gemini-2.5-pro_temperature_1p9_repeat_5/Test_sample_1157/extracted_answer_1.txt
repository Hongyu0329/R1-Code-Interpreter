**Specific Procedures:** The management should be phased: 1) Emergency care including medical referral for uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%), wound debridement without replantation, and prescription of antibiotics/analgesics. 2) A healing phase while achieving medical stability. 3) Definitive treatment with a prosthesis after healing and diabetic control are established.
**Cells of Interest:** The **periodontal ligament (PDL) cells** on the avulsed teeth are of interest because their non-viability after 28 hours contraindicates replantation. Additionally, the function of healing cells like **neutrophils, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts** is of interest as they are negatively impacted by the patient's uncontrolled diabetes.
**Denture Plan:** If choosing a denture, the ideal choice is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture** made of a **Cobalt-Chrome alloy** with acrylic teeth. The **abutment teeth** would be the **left central incisor and left second premolar** for direct support, and crucially, **teeth on the right side (e.g., first molar and first premolar)** for cross-arch stabilization to counteract forces from the patient's prognathic mandible (SNB 88‚Å∞, Skeletal Class III).
