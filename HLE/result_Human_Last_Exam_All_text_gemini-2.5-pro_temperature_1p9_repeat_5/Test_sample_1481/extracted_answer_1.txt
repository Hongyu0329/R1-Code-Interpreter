In the limit as the arc-length separation `|s' - s| → 0`, the asymptotic behavior of the generating function `H(s, s')` is given by the expansion:

`H(s, s') = |s' - s| - (1/24)κ(s)²|s' - s|³ + O(|s' - s|⁵)`

Here, `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at the point `s`. The leading term `|s' - s|` represents the chord length as an approximation to the arc length, while the first-order correction term `-(1/24)κ(s)²|s' - s|³` rigorously quantifies the shortening of the chord due to the boundary's curvature. This term reveals that the deviation is proportional to the square of the curvature and the cube of the separation distance.
