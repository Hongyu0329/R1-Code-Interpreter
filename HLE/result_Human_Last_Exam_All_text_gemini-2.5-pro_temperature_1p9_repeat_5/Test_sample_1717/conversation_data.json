    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about the health of a specific boss, the **Eye of Cthulhu**, under specific conditions: **Expert Mode** and with an **infinite number of players**. The answer must be based on the game's **source code**.\n\n2.  **Determine Base Health in Expert Mode:** The first step is to find the starting health value for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. Consulting the game's data, which is derived from the source code, this value is **3640 HP**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Health Scaling Formula:** In Terraria's multiplayer, the health of bosses scales with the number of players. We need to find the specific formula for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    *   The formula is not a simple percentage multiplier on the total player count. Instead, it's an additive bonus for each player after the first.\n    *   The confirmed formula for the Expert Mode Eye of Cthulhu is:\n        `Total Health = Base Health + (Health Bonus Per Player * (Number of Players - 1))`\n    *   Plugging in the known values:\n        `Total Health = 3640 + (1300 * (P - 1))`\n        Where `P` is the number of players (`P ≥ 1`).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Formula for Infinite Players (Mathematical Limit):** The question assumes an \"infinite number of players\". We can analyze the formula by taking the limit as the number of players (`P`) approaches infinity.\n    *   Formula: `H(P) = 3640 + 1300 * (P - 1)`\n    *   Simplified: `H(P) = 3640 + 1300*P - 1300 = 2340 + 1300*P`\n    *   As `P` approaches infinity (`P → ∞`), the term `1300*P` also approaches infinity. Therefore, the mathematical limit of the health formula is infinity.\n\n5.  **Consider the Constraints of the Source Code:** This is the most crucial point. The question specifically references the \"source code of the video game Terraria\". A computer program cannot store a truly infinite number. Values are stored in variables of specific data types, which have inherent limits.\n    *   In the Terraria source code (written in C#), an NPC's health and maximum health (`life` and `lifeMax`) are stored as **32-bit signed integers** (`int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer has a minimum value of -2,147,483,648 and a maximum value of **2,147,483,647**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Theoretical Maximum:** As the number of players increases, the game will calculate a progressively higher health value. However, once this calculated value exceeds the maximum storable value for an `int`, it will be capped at that maximum. The game engine cannot assign a health value higher than what the `lifeMax` variable can hold. Therefore, the *theoretical maximum health according to the source code* is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Step 1:** The Eye of Cthulhu's health in single-player Expert Mode is 3640.\n*   **Step 2:** For each additional player, its health increases by 1300.\n*   **Step 3:** The health (`H`) for `P` players is calculated by the formula `H(P) = 3640 + 1300 * (P - 1)`.\n*   **Step 4:** As `P` increases, `H(P)` increases without bound. For a sufficiently large number of players, the calculated health will exceed any given number.\n*   **Step 5:** The game stores this health value in a variable type (`int`) that has a maximum limit of `2^31 - 1`.\n*   **Step 6:** This limit is `2,147,483,647`. No matter how many players are added beyond the point where this health value is reached, the boss's health cannot go any higher due to this engine constraint.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2,147,483,647>>>"
