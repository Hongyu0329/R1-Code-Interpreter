    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terminology\n\n*   **Feynman diagrams:** These are pictorial representations of the mathematical expressions describing the interactions of subatomic particles.\n*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics. It describes how light and matter interact.\n*   **Electron or Photon Propagators:** A propagator represents the propagation of a particle from one point to another. In perturbation theory, the \"bare\" propagator (a simple line) is corrected by adding more complex diagrams representing interactions. These corrections are also known as self-energy diagrams.\n*   **Order 2n:** In QED, the fundamental interaction vertex involves three particles: two electrons (fermions) and one photon (boson). The strength of this interaction is determined by the elementary charge, `e`. Physical observables are calculated as a power series in the fine-structure constant, `α = e^2 / (4πħc)`. A diagram's order in the perturbation series is related to the number of vertices, as each vertex contributes a factor of `e` to the amplitude. An `n`-th order correction in `α` (i.e., a term proportional to `α^n`) corresponds to diagrams with `2n` vertices. Thus, \"order `2n`\" refers to diagrams containing `2n` vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Combinatorial Problem\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the propagator corrections. Let's consider the electron self-energy as a concrete example.\n*   The diagrams consist of an electron line that enters, interacts with virtual particles, and then exits.\n*   The corrections involve the electron emitting and reabsorbing virtual photons.\n*   At order `2n`, there are `2n` interaction vertices along the path of the electron. These `2n` vertices must be connected in pairs by `n` internal photon lines to form a valid diagram.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to a combinatorial one: **In how many ways can you connect `2n` distinct vertices in pairs?**\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Formula\n\nLet's find the number of ways to form `n` pairs from `2n` distinct points (vertices).\n1.  Pick any one vertex. There are `2n - 1` other vertices it can be connected to (paired with).\n2.  After forming the first pair, `2n - 2` vertices remain. Pick one of the remaining vertices. There are `2n - 3` vertices it can be connected to.\n3.  Continue this process. The third pair can be chosen in `2n - 5` ways, and so on, until the last two vertices are paired in only 1 way.\n\nThe total number of ways to form the pairings is the product:\n`a(n) = (2n - 1) * (2n - 3) * (2n - 5) * ... * 3 * 1`\n\nThis product is known as the **double factorial** of `2n - 1`, denoted as `(2n - 1)!!`.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of these diagrams is `a(n) = (2n - 1)!!`.\n\nThis same combinatorial factor applies to the leading-order diagrams for the photon self-energy (vacuum polarization), where a virtual electron-positron loop has `2n` vertices connected by `n` internal photon lines.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating a(3)\n\nThe question asks for `a(3)`. This corresponds to `n = 3`.\n*   The order is `2n = 2 * 3 = 6`. This means we are counting diagrams with 6 vertices.\n*   We need to calculate `a(3)` using the formula `a(n) = (2n - 1)!!`.\n\nSubstitute `n = 3` into the formula:\n`a(3) = (2 * 3 - 1)!!`\n`a(3) = (6 - 1)!!`\n`a(3) = 5!!`\n\nNow, we calculate the double factorial `5!!`:\n`5!! = 5 * 3 * 1`\n`5!! = 15`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Interpretation of \"order 2n\":** It is crucial to correctly interpret this as the number of vertices, which is standard in this context. An order `n` calculation in `α` has diagrams with `2n` vertices.\n*   **Non-vanishing diagrams:** The formula `(2n-1)!!` counts the number of topologically distinct ways to connect the vertices. In QED, these diagrams are generally non-zero and contribute to the self-energy. Issues like Furry's theorem (which sets some amplitudes to zero) are not relevant for these specific propagator diagrams.\n*   **Electron vs. Photon propagator:** The core combinatorial factor is the same for both, as it concerns the pairing of vertices with photon lines. The detailed mathematical expressions for the diagrams would differ, but the number of distinct diagram topologies is the same.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6 (which corresponds to n=3) for the electron or the photon propagators is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
