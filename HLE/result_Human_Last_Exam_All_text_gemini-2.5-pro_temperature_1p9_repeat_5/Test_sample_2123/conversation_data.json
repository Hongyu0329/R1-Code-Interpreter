    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n*   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n*   **Location:** Vienna.\n*   **Subject:** Wide boulevards.\n*   **Clue:** The surname of an English poet appears in the description.\n*   **Goal:** Name this surname in English.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key geographical feature of Vienna**\nThe most famous \"wide boulevards\" of Vienna form a ring road around the historical center. This is known as the **Ringstrasse**, which literally translates to \"Ring Street\".\n\n**Step 3: Translate the key concept into Russian**\nThe English word \"ring\" translates into Russian as **\"кольцо\"** (pronounced \"kol'tso\"). Therefore, a Russian description of the Ringstrasse would almost certainly use the word \"кольцо\".\n\n**Step 4: Find the connection to an English poet**\nThe puzzle states that the surname of an English poet appears in this description. We need to find an English poet whose surname sounds similar to the Russian word \"кольцо\".\n\n*   Let's consider the sound of \"кольцо\" (\"kol'tso\").\n*   Now, let's think of famous English poets' surnames.\n*   The surname **Coleridge** (as in Samuel Taylor Coleridge) is a very strong candidate.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the connection**\n*   In Russian, the surname \"Coleridge\" is written as **\"Кольридж\"** (pronounced \"Kol'ridzh\").\n*   The first syllable, **\"Коль\"** (\"Kol'\"), is phonetically very similar to the word for ring, **\"кольцо\"** (\"kol'tso\").\n*   This creates a pun or a wordplay that a Russian author or translator might use when describing Vienna's \"Ring\" street (\"кольцо\"). The similarity is the heart of the riddle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe geographical feature is the Vienna Ring (Ringstrasse). The Russian word for \"ring\" is \"кольцо\". The English poet whose surname sounds like this word in Russian is Coleridge (\"Кольридж\").\n\n<<<Coleridge>>>"
