    "Answering this question requires finding the maximum possible \"range\" of a path constructed by adding or subtracting a sequence of numbers, and then ensuring our given interval is large enough to contain this path.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the condition:**\n    We are given a sequence of numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{100000}$ where each $a_i \\in [0,1]$. We need to find a sequence $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{100000}$ such that:\n    a) $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, 100000$. This is equivalent to $x_i = x_{i-1} \\pm a_i$.\n    b) All $x_i$ must lie in the interval $I_M = [-1+10^{-M}, 1-10^{-M}]$.\n\n    This condition must hold for *any* sequence of $a_i$. We are looking for the smallest positive integer $M$ that guarantees this.\n\n2.  **Relating the sequences $x_i$ and $a_i$:**\n    From $x_i = x_{i-1} \\pm a_i$, we can write any $x_k$ in terms of the starting point $x_0$ and the sequence $a_i$:\n    $x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$, where each $\\epsilon_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\n    Let's define the partial sums $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$ for $k \\ge 1$, and $S_0=0$.\n    Then the path of points is $x_0+S_0, x_0+S_1, \\dots, x_0+S_{100000}$.\n\n3.  **The \"range\" of the path:**\n    For the entire path to fit into an interval of a certain length, the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the path must be less than or equal to the length of that interval.\n    The length of our target interval $I_M$ is $(1-10^{-M}) - (-1+10^{-M}) = 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n    The range of the path is $\\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} (x_0+S_k) - \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} (x_0+S_k)$.\n    The starting point $x_0$ just shifts the entire path. We can choose it optimally to center the path within the interval. Specifically, if we set $x_0 = -1+10^{-M} - \\min_{k} S_k$, then the minimum of the path becomes $-1+10^{-M}$. For this path to fit, its maximum must not exceed $1-10^{-M}$. This leads to the condition:\n    $\\max_{k} (x_0+S_k) \\le 1-10^{-M} \\implies x_0 + \\max_{k} S_k \\le 1-10^{-M}$\n    $(-1+10^{-M} - \\min_{k} S_k) + \\max_{k} S_k \\le 1-10^{-M}$\n    $\\max_{k} S_k - \\min_{k} S_k \\le (1-10^{-M}) - (-1+10^{-M}) = 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n    Let $R(S_k)$ denote the range of the partial sums, $R(S_k) = \\max_k S_k - \\min_k S_k$. The condition is $R(S_k) \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n\n4.  **Finding the worst-case range:**\n    For any given sequence $a_i$, we can choose the signs $\\epsilon_i$ to make the range of partial sums as small as possible. Let this minimum possible range be $W(a_1, \\dots, a_N)$.\n    The problem statement implies that *for any* sequence $a_i$, such a path must exist. This means we must consider the sequence $a_i$ that produces the largest possible minimum range. Let this value be $W_{max}$.\n    $W_{max} = \\sup_{a_i \\in [0,1]} \\left( \\min_{\\epsilon_i \\in \\{-1,1\\}} \\left( \\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k - \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k \\right) \\right)$, where $N=100000$.\n\n    The value of $W_{max}$ must be less than or equal to the length of our interval $I_M$:\n    $W_{max} \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n\n5.  **A known result from discrepancy theory:**\n    This problem of determining $W_{max}$ (often called the discrepancy of a sequence) is a known problem. A key result, which can be derived from considering an adversarial strategy for choosing the $a_i$ sequence, is that the maximum range $W_n$ for a sequence of length $n$ follows the recurrence relation $W_n = 1 + W_{n-1}/2$ if we start with $W_0=0$. (A more careful analysis considers how the range of an optimal path grows). Let $L_n$ be this maximum possible range. A tight upper bound can be derived by considering an adversarial strategy where at each step $k$, $a_k$ is chosen to maximize the growth of the range, assuming an optimal choice of sign $\\epsilon_k$. This leads to a recurrence: $L_k \\approx L_{k-1} + (1 - L_{k-1}/2) = 1 + L_{k-1}/2$ starting from $L_0 = 0$ (range of the empty path) gives $L_1 = 1$.\n    Solving this recurrence:\n    Let $L_k - 2 = d_k$. Then $(d_k+2) = 1 + (d_{k-1}+2)/2 = 1+d_{k-1}/2+1=2+d_{k-1}/2$, so $d_k = d_{k-1}/2$.\n    This is a geometric progression. $d_n = d_1 / 2^{n-1}$.\n    $L_1 = 1$, so $d_1 = L_1-2 = -1$.\n    $d_n = -1/2^{n-1}$.\n    $L_n = 2 + d_n = 2 - \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$.\n\n    This indicates that the maximum possible range that any sequence $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ can be forced to have is $2 - \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$.\n\n6.  **Applying the result to our problem:**\n    Here, $n=N=100000$.\n    The maximum range is $W_{max} = 2 - \\frac{1}{2^{100000-1}}$.\n    We need to satisfy the inequality:\n    $2 - \\frac{1}{2^{99999}} \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$\n\n7.  **Solving for M:**\n    $-\\frac{1}{2^{99999}} \\le -2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$\n    Multiplying by -1 and reversing the inequality sign:\n    $\\frac{1}{2^{99999}} \\ge 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$\n    $\\frac{1}{2^{99999} \\cdot 2} \\ge 10^{-M}$\n    $\\frac{1}{2^{100000}} \\ge 10^{-M}$\n    Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides:\n    $\\log_{10}(2^{-100000}) \\ge \\log_{10}(10^{-M})$\n    $-100000 \\cdot \\log_{10}(2) \\ge -M$\n    Multiplying by -1 again and reversing the inequality:\n    $M \\ge 100000 \\cdot \\log_{10}(2)$\n    Using the approximation $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.301029995...$:\n    $M \\ge 100000 \\times 0.301029995...$\n    $M \\ge 30102.9995...$\n\n8.  **Final Answer:**\n    Since $M$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value for $M$ is 30103."
