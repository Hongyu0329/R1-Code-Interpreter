    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the physicist in question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Key Points:**\n    The question provides several specific clues to identify the correct person:\n    *   **Profession:** A physicist.\n    *   **Primary Field:** \"Better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n    *   **Discovery:** An \"optical effect.\"\n    *   **Context:** The effect is observable in \"real imagery.\"\n    *   **Origin Story:** The effect was accidentally observed by a \"custodial worker\" who was \"cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Crucial Anecdote:**\n    The most unique and identifying part of the question is the story of the accidental discovery by a custodial worker. This historical anecdote is the key to solving the puzzle. We need to find a story in the history of physics that matches this description. Searching for stories about scientific discoveries involving janitors or cleaning staff and optical equipment is a direct approach.\n\n3.  **Identify the Physicist and the Effect:**\n    This famous story is attributed to the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**. The anecdote describes how imperfections, such as dust or cleaning streaks on a concave optical grating or mirror, were found to be surprisingly visible. These imperfections weren't seen when looking *at* the mirror itself, but were clearly visible in the *real image* formed by the mirror at its focal plane. Zernike used this observation as an inspiration and a powerful analogy for his discovery.\n\n4.  **Connect the Discovery to Microscopy:**\n    The question states the physicist is \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" This strongly points to Frits Zernike.\n    *   The optical effect he discovered is called **phase contrast**.\n    *   His application of this principle led to the invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**.\n    *   This invention was revolutionary because it allowed scientists, for the first time, to view transparent specimens like living cells without staining them (which usually kills them).\n    *   For this achievement, Frits Zernike was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953. This solidifies his reputation as a key figure in the field of microscopy.\n\n5.  **Explain the Underlying Physics:**\n    *   The imperfections (streaks, dust) on the concave mirror did not significantly block or absorb light, so they were invisible under normal observation. Instead, they introduced a slight **phase shift** in the light waves that reflected off them.\n    *   The human eye cannot detect these phase shifts.\n    *   Zernike realized that at the focal plane where a real image is formed, interference patterns make these phase shifts visible as variations in brightness (amplitude). He devised an optical system (the phase-contrast microscope) to systematically convert invisible phase shifts into visible changes in image brightness. The streaks seen by the worker were a natural and accidental demonstration of this principle.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Anecdote vs. Literal Truth:** While the story of the custodial worker is widely told, some historical accounts suggest it may be an illustrative anecdote Zernike used for teaching, rather than the literal spark of discovery. However, it perfectly encapsulates the physical principle he discovered and is invariably linked to him.\n*   **Concave Mirror's Role:** The concave mirror is key because it forms a real image where the phase-shift effects become observable as interference patterns.\n*   **Distinguishing from Other Physicists:** It is important not to confuse this story with other discoveries. For instance, the Compton effect (Arthur Compton) also involves a famous discovery but relates to X-ray scattering, not optical microscopy.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy linking the specific anecdote of the custodial worker and the concave mirror to a major figure in microscopy, we can confidently identify the physicist. All the clues—the field of work, the nature of the discovery, and the origin story—point directly to Frits Zernike and his discovery of phase contrast.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
