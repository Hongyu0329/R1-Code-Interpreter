The optimal combination is a single-site catalyst consisting of a **Zirconium (Zr)** metal center, coordinated by a bulky, electron-donating **Pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*)** ligand, which is chemically grafted onto a high-surface-area, strongly acidic support like **Sulfated Alumina (Al2O3-S)**.
