    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the musical terminology used in the question:\n*   **The Beatles:** The artist in question. The song must be from their official discography.\n*   **Starts with:** The chord progression must occur at the very beginning of the song, as part of the introduction.\n*   **Chord jump:** This implies a direct and prominent transition from one chord to the next.\n*   **Tonic:** This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key. It's the first chord in the scale and is typically major. It's designated with the Roman numeral **I**.\n*   **Minor fifth chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale. Normally, the chord on the fifth degree is major (the V chord, or \"dominant\"). Making it a minor chord (a **v** chord) is a common and distinctive songwriting technique called \"modal interchange,\" where a chord is borrowed from the parallel minor key.\n\n### Step 2: Translate the Progression into Specific Chords\n\nLet's assume a common key for The Beatles, such as A Major.\n*   The **Tonic (I) chord** in the key of A Major is **A Major**.\n*   The fifth note in the A Major scale is E. The standard fifth chord would be E Major (V).\n*   The **minor fifth (v) chord** would therefore be **E minor**.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song, likely in the key of A Major, that starts with a prominent chord change from **A Major to E minor**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Candidate Beatles Songs\n\nLet's examine the introductions of several Beatles songs to find this specific I -> v progression.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: \"Ticket to Ride\"**\n    *   **Key:** A Major. The tonic (I) is indeed A Major.\n    *   **Intro:** The song begins with an iconic ringing 12-string guitar riff that is based on the A Major chord. This clearly establishes the tonic. When the vocals enter with the line \"I think I'm gonna be sad,\" the underlying chord changes to **E minor**.\n    *   **Analysis:** This fits the description. The song establishes its tonic (A Major) and then jumps to the minor fifth (E minor) at the start of the verse.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: \"I'll Be Back\"**\n    *   **Key:** A Major. The tonic (I) is A Major.\n    *   **Intro:** The song opens with an acoustic guitar playing the chord **A Major** immediately followed by the chord **E minor**. This A -> Em progression is then repeated several times to form the entire intro before the vocals begin.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a perfect and very literal fit for the question. The entire introduction is built exclusively on the \"jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\"\n\n*   **Candidate 3: \"Michelle\"**\n    *   **Key:** F minor. The tonic is a minor chord, which doesn't fit the typical \"Tonic (I) -> minor fifth (v)\" structure where the tonic is usually major. While the verse famously uses a C minor chord (the minor fifth of F), the song does not start with a jump from an F Major tonic.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Candidates and Select the Best Answer\n\nBoth \"Ticket to Ride\" and \"I'll Be Back\" use the I -> v progression at the beginning of the song. However, \"I'll Be Back\" is the more direct and precise answer.\n*   In **\"I'll Be Back,\"** the chord jump **A -> Em** *is* the intro. The song literally starts with this progression, repeated.\n*   In **\"Ticket to Ride,\"** the song starts with an instrumental riff establishing the tonic chord (A), and the jump to the minor fifth (Em) happens as the vocal part begins.\n\nWhile both are technically correct, \"I'll Be Back\" most perfectly embodies the phrase \"starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\" The melancholy feel of the A -> Em progression sets the somber tone of the song's lyrics.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
