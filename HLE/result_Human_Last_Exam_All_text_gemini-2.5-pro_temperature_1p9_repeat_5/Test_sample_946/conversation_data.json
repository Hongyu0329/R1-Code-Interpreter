    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key components of the question.**\n*   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event:** The Junior prom (also referred to as the \"Jv Jr. Varsi-ty Prom\" in the episode).\n*   **Performer:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Question:** What is the name of the fictional singer?\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the events of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThe episode follows Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One as they prepare for and attend their Junior prom. A key part of the prom is the musical entertainment.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the scene at the prom.**\nWhen the girls arrive at the prom, the musical \"performer\" is shown on a small stage. It is explicitly not a real person or band.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the performer's depiction and name.**\nThe \"live entertainment\" is a cardboard cutout of a female singer holding a microphone. Next to the cutout is a handwritten sign.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The question specifies a \"fictional singer.\" The name will be a made-up name typical of the Homestar Runner universe's humor.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** In the episode, an earlier flyer for the prom shows the musical guest as \"CARDIGAN\", but this name is crossed out. This is a potential red herring. We need the name of the performer who is actually *at* the prom.\n\n**Step 5: Read the sign next to the cutout.**\nThe sign at the prom clearly reads: \"LIVE performance by KINDA SURPLUS\". The show's narrator then announces, \"The live musical stylings of a cardboard cutout of Kinda Surplus!\"\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the information to form the final answer.**\nBased on the visual evidence and dialogue within \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the cardboard cutout at the Junior prom is of a fictional singer named Kinda Surplus.\n\n<<<Kinda Surplus>>>"
