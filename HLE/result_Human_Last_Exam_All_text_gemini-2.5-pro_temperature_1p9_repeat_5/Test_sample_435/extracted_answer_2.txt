CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to exhibit enhanced cytokine release, characterized by greater polyfunctionality (the ability to produce multiple cytokines like IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 simultaneously) and sustained production upon antigen stimulation, compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
