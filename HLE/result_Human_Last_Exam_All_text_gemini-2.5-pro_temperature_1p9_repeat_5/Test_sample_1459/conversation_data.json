    "**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n**1. Define the Metric Spaces**\n\n*   Let $(X, d_X)$ be the interval $[0, 1]$ with the standard absolute value metric, $d_X(x, x') = |x - x'|$.\n*   Let $(Y, d_Y)$ be the unit circle with the intrinsic metric. The \"unit circle\" is standardly interpreted as a circle of radius 1 in the Euclidean plane. Its circumference is $C = 2\\pi R = 2\\pi$. The intrinsic metric (or arc length metric) $d_Y(y, y')$ is the length of the shorter arc connecting the points $y$ and $y'$.\n*   We can represent the circle $Y$ as the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$ with its endpoints identified. The distance between two points represented by angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ is $d_Y(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\min(|\\theta_1 - \\theta_2|, 2\\pi - |\\theta_1 - \\theta_2|)$.\n\n**2. Key Properties of the Spaces**\n\n*   **For X = [0,1]:**\n    *   The diameter is $\\text{diam}(X) = \\sup_{x, x' \\in X} |x - x'| = |1 - 0| = 1$.\n*   **For Y = S¹ (circumference 2π):**\n    *   The diameter is the largest possible distance between two points, which is the distance between any point and its antipode. This distance is half the circumference.\n    *   $\\text{diam}(Y) = (2\\pi)/2 = \\pi$.\n\n**3. Recall the Definition of Gromov-Hausdorff Distance**\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance, $d_{GH}(X, Y)$, can be defined using correspondences. A correspondence is a relation $R \\subseteq X \\times Y$ which is surjective onto both $X$ and $Y$. The distortion of a correspondence $R$ is:\n$\\text{dis}(R) = \\sup_{(x,y), (x',y') \\in R} |d_X(x,x') - d_Y(y,y')|$\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance is then given by:\n$d_{GH}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\inf_R \\text{dis}(R)$\n\n**4. Establish a Lower Bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff Distance**\n\nA powerful method to find a lower bound is to find a lower bound for the distortion of *any* correspondence.\nLet $R$ be an arbitrary correspondence between $X=[0,1]$ and $Y=S^1_{2\\pi}$.\n\n*   Consider two antipodal points $y_a, y_b$ in $Y$. The distance between them is the diameter of $Y$, so $d_Y(y_a, y_b) = \\pi$.\n*   Because $R$ is a correspondence, there must exist points $x_a, x_b$ in $X=[0,1]$ such that $(x_a, y_a) \\in R$ and $(x_b, y_b) \\in R$.\n*   The distance between these points in $X$ is $d_X(x_a, x_b) = |x_a - x_b|$. Since $x_a, x_b \\in [0,1]$, this distance is at most the diameter of $X$, so $0 \\le d_X(x_a, x_b) \\le 1$.\n*   By the definition of distortion, for this specific pair of pairs, we must have:\n    $|d_X(x_a, x_b) - d_Y(y_a, y_b)| \\le \\text{dis}(R)$\n    $|d_X(x_a, x_b) - \\pi| \\le \\text{dis}(R)$\n*   To find the minimum possible value of the left-hand side, we see that the expression $|v - \\pi|$ for $v \\in [0,1]$ is minimized when $v$ is as large as possible, i.e., $v=1$.\n*   So, $|d_X(x_a, x_b) - \\pi| \\ge |1 - \\pi| = \\pi - 1$.\n*   This implies that for any correspondence $R$, its distortion must be at least $\\pi - 1$.\n    $\\text{dis}(R) \\ge \\pi - 1$.\n*   Taking the infimum over all correspondences, we get:\n    $\\inf_R \\text{dis}(R) \\ge \\pi - 1$.\n*   Using the formula for the GH distance, we have our lower bound:\n    $d_{GH}(X, Y) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}(\\pi - 1)$.\n\n**5. Establish an Upper Bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff Distance**\n\nTo find an upper bound, we can construct a specific correspondence and calculate its distortion. A natural correspondence is to \"wrap\" the interval $[0,1]$ exactly once around the circle $S^1_{2\\pi}$.\n*   Let the correspondence $R_0$ be the graph of the map $f: [0,1] \\to S^1_{2\\pi}$ where $f(x)$ is the point on the circle at angle $2\\pi x$.\n    $R_0 = \\{ (x, \\text{point at angle } 2\\pi x) \\mid x \\in [0,1] \\}$. This is a valid correspondence because the map is surjective.\n*   Let's compute the distortion of $R_0$. We take two pairs $(x, y)$ and $(x', y')$ from $R_0$.\n    $d_X(x, x') = |x-x'|$.\n    The corresponding points on the circle are at angles $2\\pi x$ and $2\\pi x'$. The distance is:\n    $d_Y(y, y') = \\min(|2\\pi x - 2\\pi x'|, 2\\pi - |2\\pi x - 2\\pi x'|)$.\n    Let $u = |x-x'|$, where $u \\in [0,1]$.\n    $d_Y(y, y') = \\min(2\\pi u, 2\\pi(1-u)) = 2\\pi \\min(u, 1-u)$.\n*   The distortion of $R_0$ is $\\text{dis}(R_0) = \\sup_{u \\in [0,1]} |u - 2\\pi \\min(u, 1-u)|$.\n    *   **Case 1:** $u \\in [0, 1/2]$. $\\min(u, 1-u) = u$. The expression is $|u - 2\\pi u| = u(2\\pi - 1)$. This is an increasing function, maximized at $u=1/2$, giving value $(1/2)(2\\pi - 1) = \\pi - 1/2$.\n    *   **Case 2:** $u \\in [1/2, 1]$. $\\min(u, 1-u) = 1-u$. The expression is $|u - 2\\pi(1-u)| = |u(1+2\\pi) - 2\\pi|$. This is a linear function of $u$. The maximum absolute value will be at one of the endpoints, $u=1/2$ or $u=1$.\n        *   At $u=1/2$: $|(1/2)(1+2\\pi) - 2\\pi| = |1/2 + \\pi - 2\\pi| = |1/2 - \\pi| = \\pi - 1/2$.\n        *   At $u=1$: $|1(1+2\\pi) - 2\\pi| = |1| = 1$.\n*   Comparing all values, the maximum is $\\pi - 1/2$. Thus, $\\text{dis}(R_0) = \\pi - 1/2$.\n*   This gives an upper bound for the GH distance:\n    $d_{GH}(X, Y) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\text{dis}(R_0) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\pi - 1/2) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have established the bounds:\n$(\\pi - 1)/2 \\le d_{GH}([0,1], S^1) \\le \\pi/2 - 1/4$.\nNumerically, this is approximately $1.07 \\le d_{GH} \\le 1.32$.\n\nThe lower bound argument is very general and establishes a minimum distortion required to reconcile the difference in diameters. It is known that this bound is tight. This implies that there exists a (more complex) correspondence whose distortion is exactly $\\pi - 1$. The construction of such an optimal correspondence is non-trivial, but the lower bound on the distortion of any correspondence is sufficient to determine the distance.\n\nTherefore, the infimum distortion is $\\pi-1$. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance is half of this value.\n\nFinal Answer = $\\frac{1}{2}(\\pi-1) = \\frac{\\pi-1}{2}$.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning: The argument proving $\\text{dis}(R) \\ge \\pi-1$ for any correspondence is sound. If a result is known to have a \"clean\" answer, it's very likely that this lower bound is achievable, meaning it is the infimum. Thus, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is $\\frac{\\pi-1}{2}$."
