    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular formula and the atoms involved.**\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n*   This means the calculation involves 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe name \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions. This notation must be interpreted for each type of atom in the molecule.\n\n*   **For non-hydrogen atoms (like Carbon):**\n    *   The `6-` prefix means the **core** orbitals are described by a single contracted function, which is formed by a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   The `-31` part means the **valence** shell is split into two parts (a \"split-valence\" or \"double-zeta\" description):\n        *   The inner valence part is described by one contracted function per orbital, each formed from **3** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The outer valence part is described by one contracted function per orbital, each formed from **1** primitive Gaussian.\n*   **For Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s electron is in the valence shell.\n    *   The `6-` prefix does not apply. The `31` part describes the split of its 1s valence orbital.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted functions for a single Carbon (C) atom.**\n*   A carbon atom (atomic number 6) has electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core (1s²):** The 1s orbital is represented by **1 contracted function** (from the `6-` part).\n*   **Valence (2s², 2p²):** The valence shell contains s and p orbitals. Both are split according to the `-31` rule.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`-3` part):** This gives one s-type contracted function and three p-type contracted functions (px, py, pz). Total: 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 contracted functions**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`-1` part):** This gives another one s-type contracted function and another three p-type contracted functions. Total: 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 contracted functions**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom** = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of contracted functions for a single Hydrogen (H) atom.**\n*   A hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has electron configuration 1s¹. It only has a valence shell.\n*   The 1s valence orbital is split according to the `-31` rule.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`-3` part):** This gives **1 contracted s-function**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`-1` part):** This gives **1 contracted s-function**.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom** = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted functions for Toluene (C7H8).**\n*   Sum the functions for all the atoms in the molecule.\n*   **Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n*   **Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n*   **Total Contracted Functions:** 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* functions (also known as basis functions), not the total number of underlying *primitive* Gaussians.\n*   **Applying the Notation Correctly:** The interpretation of the `6-` and `-31G` parts is different for hydrogen versus second-row elements like carbon.\n*   **Valence Shell Splitting:** For carbon, it is crucial to remember that both the 2s and 2p orbitals are part of the valence shell and are therefore both split into inner and outer representations.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n1.  **Functions per Carbon:** 9\n2.  **Functions per Hydrogen:** 2\n3.  **Total for C7H8:** (7 × 9) + (8 × 2) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
