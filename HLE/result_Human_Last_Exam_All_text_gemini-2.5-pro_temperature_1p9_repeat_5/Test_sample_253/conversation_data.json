    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final binary pattern.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand Cellular Automaton Rule 110**\n\nA cellular automaton consists of a grid of cells, each with a state (here, 0 or 1). In an elementary cellular automaton, the grid is one-dimensional, and the state of a cell in the next step is determined by its own current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors.\n\nA \"rule\" defines the output for all 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood configurations. Rule 110 is named after the decimal value of the binary sequence that defines its outputs.\n\n1.  **Convert Rule Number to Binary:** The decimal number 110 is converted to an 8-bit binary number:\n    `110₁₀ = 01101110₂`\n\n2.  **Create the Rule Table:** This 8-bit binary string corresponds to the output for each possible neighborhood, ordered from `111` down to `000`.\n\n| Current Neighborhood (Left, Center, Right) | Output (`01101110`) | Next State of Center Cell |\n|:------------------------------------------|:--------------------:|:---------------------------:|\n| 111                                        |          0           |              0              |\n| 110                                        |          1           |              1              |\n| 101                                        |          1           |              1              |\n| 100                                        |          0           |              0              |\n| 011                                        |          1           |              1              |\n| 010                                        |          1           |              1              |\n| 001                                        |          1           |              1              |\n| 000                                        |          0           |              0              |\n\n### **Step 2: Define Initial Conditions and Perform Iterations**\n\nWe start with a single cell in state 1 at time `t=0`. We assume the infinite grid is filled with 0s on both sides. We will apply the rule 20 times. In each step, we calculate the state of every cell for the next generation based on its 3-cell neighborhood in the current generation.\n\nLet's represent the binary pattern at each step. Note that we only show the significant part of the pattern (the part containing 1s and the 0s between them).\n\n*   **t=0:** `1`\n*   **t=1:** We analyze the neighborhoods around the `1` in `...00100...`:\n    *   `001` -> `1`\n    *   `010` -> `1`\n    *   `100` -> `0`\n    Result: `11`\n\n*   **t=2:** Analyzing `...001100...`:\n    *   `001` -> `1`\n    *   `011` -> `1`\n    *   `110` -> `1`\n    Result: `111`\n\nThis process is repeated for all 20 steps.\n\n### **Step 3: List the Pattern at Each Step (t=0 to t=20)**\n\nExecuting the process for 20 steps yields the following sequence of patterns.\n\n*   **t = 0:** `1`\n*   **t = 1:** `11`\n*   **t = 2:** `111`\n*   **t = 3:** `1101`\n*   **t = 4:** `11111`\n*   **t = 5:** `110001`\n*   **t = 6:** `1110011`\n*   **t = 7:** `11010111`\n*   **t = 8:** `11111101`\n*   **t = 9:** `110000111`\n*   **t = 10:** `1110001101`\n*   **t = 11:** `11010011111`\n*   **t = 12:** `111110110001`\n*   **t = 13:** `1100011110011`\n*   **t = 14:** `11100110010111`\n*   **t = 15:** `110101110111101`\n*   **t = 16:** `1111111011100111`\n*   **t = 17:** `11000001110101101`\n*   **t = 18:** `11100001011111111`\n*   **t = 19:** `11010001110000001`\n*   **t = 20:** From the pattern at t=19 (`...0110100011100000010...`), we calculate the next line.\n    *   ...`001` -> `1`\n    *   `011` -> `1`\n    *   `110` -> `1`\n    *   `101` -> `1`\n    *   `010` -> `1`\n    *   `100` -> `0`\n    *   ... and so on.\n    The final calculated pattern for `t=20` is `11111001101000011`.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter applying Rule 110 for 20 steps, starting from a single '1' cell, the resulting binary pattern is:\n\n<<<11111001101000011>>>"
