    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks for an Oscar-nominated film with a very specific set of criteria:\n1.  **A major award criteria:** The film must be \"Oscar-nominated.\"\n2.  **A specific character action:** A character says the phrase \"Thank you.\"\n3.  **A specific setting:** This action occurs while \"boarding a bus.\"\n4.  **A specific consequence:** This action \"seals his fate,\" implying a tragic and irreversible outcome, likely death or capture.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Search and Identifying a Likely Candidate**\nThere is an extremely famous and pivotal scene in modern cinema that matches almost all of these criteria. The most probable film the question refers to is *The Departed* (2006), directed by Martin Scorsese.\n\n**Step 3: Addressing a Key Discrepancy (Bus vs. Elevator)**\nWhile the question specifies a \"bus,\" the memorable scene from *The Departed* takes place in an **elevator**. This is a very common point of misremembering, as both are confined public conveyances where strangers interact briefly. Given how perfectly the other elements of the question align with this scene, it is almost certain this is the film the user is thinking of.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Scene in *The Departed***\n*   **Characters involved:** The character who seals his fate is Billy Costigan (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), an undercover state trooper who has infiltrated a mob crew. The character he speaks to is Trooper Barrigan, who Billy believes is a fellow policeman.\n*   **The Context:** Billy has finally arrested Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a mole for the mob within the police force. Billy is taking Sullivan down in an elevator to expose him.\n*   **The Action and Consequence:** The elevator doors open, and Trooper Barrigan gets on. Billy recognizes him from the police academy and, likely thinking he's there as backup, offers a polite, almost relieved, \"Thank you.\" This is a fatal miscalculation. The \"Thank you\" is the last thing Billy says. Immediately after, Barrigan shoots Billy in the head, revealing he is *also* a mole for the mob. This single moment of misplaced trust, punctuated by the polite phrase, seals Billy's tragic fate.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the \"Oscar-Nominated\" Condition**\n*The Departed* was not only nominated but was a major winner at the 79th Academy Awards. It won four Oscars, including the most prestigious award:\n*   **Best Picture**\n*   **Best Director** (Martin Scorsese)\n*   **Best Adapted Screenplay**\n*   **Best Film Editing**\nIt also received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Mark Wahlberg). Therefore, it perfectly satisfies this crucial part of the question.\n\n**Conclusion**\nDespite the minor discrepancy of the setting being an elevator instead of a bus, the scene from *The Departed* is the definitive answer. The combination of an Oscar-winning film, a character sealing his fate, and the specific, ironic dialogue \"Thank you\" points directly to this iconic moment in cinematic history.\n\n<<<The Departed>>>"
