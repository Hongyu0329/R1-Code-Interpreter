    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Context\nFirst, let's break down the terminology in the question.\n1.  **The Simplex Category $\\Delta$:** The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordered sets $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for any non-negative integer $n$. The morphisms $f: [n] \\to [m]$ are order-preserving maps, i.e., for any $i, j \\in [n]$, if $i \\le j$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$.\n2.  **Locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$:** This tells us how to view $\\Delta$ as a 2-category.\n    *   **Objects (0-cells):** The objects of our category, which are the sets $[n]$.\n    *   **Morphisms (1-cells):** The order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$.\n    *   **2-cells:** For any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [n] \\to [m]$, there is a 2-cell from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order. That is, $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [n]$. The \"locally posetal\" nature means there's at most one 2-cell between any pair of parallel 1-cells.\n\n### Step 2: Defining an Internal Adjunction\nAn internal adjunction in a 2-category from an object $A$ to an object $B$ consists of a pair of morphisms, a left adjoint $f: A \\to B$ and a right adjoint $g: B \\to A$. These morphisms must satisfy certain conditions involving 2-cells.\n\nIn our specific context of a locally posetal 2-category, an adjunction from $[n]$ to $[m]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$ such that there exist 2-cells (i.e., inequalities) for the unit and counit of the adjunction. These conditions simplify to:\n1.  **Unit:** $\\mathrm{id}_{[n]} \\le g \\circ f$. This means for all $i \\in [n]$, $i \\le g(f(i))$.\n2.  **Counit:** $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[m]}$. This means for all $j \\in [m]$, $f(g(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThis pair of conditions is precisely the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $[n]$ and $[m]$, with $f$ being the left adjoint to $g$ (denoted $f \\dashv g$).\n\nOur problem is to count the number of such pairs $(f, g)$ for $n=23$ and $m=37$.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing Adjoint Functors between Posets\nIn poset theory, a map $f: P \\to Q$ has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). Similarly, a map $g: Q \\to P$ has a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\nThe objects $[n]$ are finite total orders, so they are complete lattices. Any subset of $[n]$ has a well-defined supremum (maximum) and infimum (minimum). Any order-preserving map between finite total orders automatically preserves maxima and minima of any non-empty subset. However, the preservation must hold for *all* subsets, including the empty set.\n\nLet's analyze the condition more directly.\n*   A map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ has a right adjoint $g$ if and only if for every $j \\in [m]$, the set $S_j = \\{ i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le j \\}$ has a maximum element. Since $[n]$ is a finite total order, this is equivalent to $S_j$ being non-empty for all $j \\in [m]$.\n    *   For $j=0$, the set $S_0 = \\{ i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le 0 \\}$ must be non-empty. Since the elements of $[m]$ are non-negative, $f(i) \\le 0$ implies $f(i)=0$. Thus, there must be some $i \\in [n]$ with $f(i)=0$.\n    *   As $f$ is order-preserving, $f(0) \\le f(i) = 0$, which forces $f(0)=0$.\n    *   If $f(0)=0$, then for any $j \\in [m]$ (where $j \\ge 0$), we have $f(0) \\le j$, so $0 \\in S_j$. Thus, $S_j$ is always non-empty if $f(0)=0$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** An order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ has a right adjoint if and only if $f(0)=0$.\n\nIf such a right adjoint exists, it is unique and given by the formula $g(j) = \\max \\{i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le j \\}$. Therefore, counting the adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of valid left adjoints $f$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Adjunctions\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ satisfying:\n$0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThe condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first term. So we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23:\n$f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$\nwhere each term is an integer satisfying:\n$0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using \"stars and bars\". We are choosing 23 numbers (the values of $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which contains $37+1=38$ elements) with replacement, and the order is determined by the non-decreasing condition.\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $N$ items with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\n*   $k = 23$ (the number of values we need to choose).\n*   $N = 38$ (the number of possible values for each choice).\n\nThe number of such sequences is $\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n### Step 5: Verification using the Right Adjoint\nAs a check, we can count the number of valid right adjoints $g: [m] \\to [n]$.\n*   An order-preserving map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ has a left adjoint $f$ if and only if $g$ preserves all infima.\n*   This is equivalent to the condition that for every $i \\in [n]$, the set $\\{ j \\in [m] \\mid g(j) \\ge i \\}$ has a minimum element.\n*   This requires these sets to be non-empty. For $i=n$, the set $\\{j \\in [m] \\mid g(j) \\ge n\\}$ must be non-empty. This means some $g(j)$ must be at least $n$. Since the codomain of $g$ is $[n]$, this implies $g(j)=n$.\n*   As $g$ is order-preserving, $g(m) \\ge g(j)=n$. So, we must have $g(m)=n$.\n*   If $g(m)=n$, the condition holds for all $i \\in [n]$.\n*   **Conclusion:** An order-preserving map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ has a left adjoint if and only if $g(m)=n$.\n\nSo we can count the number of order-preserving maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ with $g(37)=23$.\nSuch a map is a sequence $g(0), \\dots, g(37)$ with $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(37) \\le 23$.\nThe condition $g(37)=23$ fixes the last term. We need to count the non-decreasing sequences:\n$g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(36)$\nwhere $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le 23$.\n*   This is a sequence of length 37.\n*   The values are chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has $23+1=24$ elements.\n*   $k=37$ (length of sequence), $N=24$ (number of values).\n\nThe number is $\\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nThe results match, which gives us confidence in the answer.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial[60, 23]>>>"
