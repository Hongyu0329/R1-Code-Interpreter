    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe first clue is a quote from the poet Andrei Voznesensky: \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This tells us we are looking for a historical figure who was the subject of Voznesensky's work and was known as a sailor or explorer. The description \"joy-discovering\" is poetic and likely refers to a famous and perhaps romanticized journey of discovery.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue is another line from Voznesensky about this same man: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This is a critical piece of information. It means that for a long time, the man's burial place was unknown or lost to history. This significantly narrows down the possibilities, as most famous explorers have well-documented gravesites or memorials.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the clues to Voznesensky's work.**\nA search for these specific quotes in Voznesensky's work leads directly to his most famous piece, the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This rock opera is based on a real historical event and tells the story of the Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the historical figure against the clues.**\n*   **Nikolai Rezanov as a \"sailor\":** He was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and one of the leaders of the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth. He sailed from Russia to Alaska and then to California, making him a fitting \"sailor.\"\n*   **Rezanov's \"lost grave\":** After his expedition to California, Rezanov traveled back to St. Petersburg overland across Siberia. He fell ill, died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and was buried there. However, the cathedral where he was interred was later demolished, and his grave was lost for over a century. This perfectly matches the lament \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the third clue.**\nThe final clue states that the answer to the question of the grave's location \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" Due to the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" in the Soviet Union, there was renewed public interest in finding Rezanov's final resting place. During the era of Perestroika in the late 1980s, the location of his grave was rediscovered and confirmed. A monument was erected over the presumed site in Krasnoyarsk, effectively providing the \"answer\" that Voznesensky's poem had asked for.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the clues point directly to Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
