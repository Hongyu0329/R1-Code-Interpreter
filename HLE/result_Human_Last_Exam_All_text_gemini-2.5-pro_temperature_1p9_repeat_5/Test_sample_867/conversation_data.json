    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissonne fermées* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific performance and dancer:** The question is about the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*. The choreographer is Yuri Grigorovich, and the dancer is the prima ballerina Svetlana Zakharova. The most widely available professional recording of this production is from the Pathé Live cinema broadcast on January 25, 2015, which features this cast.\n\n2.  **Locate the relevant part of the ballet:** The question asks for a count within the Act II Odette variation. This is the solo that Odette dances after the main *adagio* of the \"White Swan\" *pas de deux*.\n\n3.  **Define the ballet step: *Sissonne fermée***: Before counting, it's crucial to correctly identify the step.\n    *   A *sissonne* is a jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   *Fermée* means \"closed.\"\n    *   Therefore, a *sissonne fermée* is a jump from two feet (usually from fifth position), landing on one foot, after which the other foot quickly closes into fifth position. In Odette's variation, these are typically performed *en avant* (traveling forward), landing with the back leg in a low arabesque before closing.\n\n4.  **Analyze the choreography of the variation:** The Grigorovich version of the Odette variation has a distinct and demanding structure. By watching the recording of Zakharova's performance, we can break down the choreography:\n    *   The variation begins with a series of *piqué attitude* turns.\n    *   This is followed by a section with *développés* and *pas de bourrée*.\n    *   The key section for this question comes next: Odette travels forward on a diagonal from upstage right towards downstage left. She performs a series of quick, sharp, traveling jumps. These are the *sissonne fermées en avant*.\n\n5.  **Count the *sissonne fermées***: By carefully observing this diagonal sequence in the recording, we can count each individual *sissonne fermée*.\n    *   She executes the first *sissonne fermée*.\n    *   She executes the second *sissonne fermée*.\n    *   She executes the third *sissonne fermée*.\n    *   She executes the fourth *sissonne fermée*.\n    *   She executes the fifth *sissonne fermée*.\n    *   She executes the sixth *sissonne fermée*.\n    *   She executes the seventh *sissonne fermée*.\n\n    Immediately after the seventh one, she performs a turning jump (*tour jeté*) to change direction. The sequence of *sissonne fermées* ends here.\n\n6.  **Review the rest of the variation:** After this diagonal sequence, the variation continues with different steps, including turns and poses. No other *sissonne fermées* are performed.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Choreographic Version:** The number of steps can vary significantly between different choreographers (e.g., Petipa/Ivanov, Grigorovich, Nureyev). The question is specific to the Grigorovich version.\n*   **Dancer's Interpretation:** While the core choreography is set, a dancer might occasionally make a minor alteration. However, in a major, recorded production like this, the choreography is performed as set. Watching Zakharova's specific performance is key.\n*   **Step Identification:** It is crucial to distinguish *sissonne fermées* from other similar-looking jumps, like *temps levé* or *jeté*. The takeoff from two feet is the defining characteristic of a sissonne.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the official recording of the 2014 Bolshoi production of *Swan Lake* starring Svetlana Zakharova, she performs exactly one sequence of *sissonne fermées* in her Act II variation. This sequence consists of seven consecutive *sissonne fermées*.\n\n<<<7>>>"
