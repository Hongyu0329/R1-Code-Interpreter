    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n    *   **Action:** Publicly identifying himself as \"azikiwe\".\n    *   **Information requested:** The specific year this action occurred.\n\n2.  **Verify the subject's name:** The person in question is Goodluck Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria. His universally recognized and official full name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Investigate the name \"Azikiwe\" in relation to the subject:**\n    *   The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's known legal or given names.\n    *   \"Azikiwe\" is a very famous name in Nigeria, belonging to Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria.\n    *   There is a common misconception or confusion in the user's question, as it incorrectly appends \"Azikiwe\" to Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n\n4.  **Search for evidence of the event:** A thorough review of public records, official statements, news archives, and biographical information for Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is required to see if he ever publicly identified himself by the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\n5.  **Analyze search results and available data:**\n    *   There are no credible public records, speeches, interviews, or documents where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has referred to himself, or identified himself, as \"Azikiwe\".\n    *   The premise of the question is based on incorrect information. He has never been known as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of the Premise:** The fundamental assumption in the question—that Goodluck Jonathan has \"Azikiwe\" in his name and has publicly identified with it—is incorrect. It's crucial to address this foundational error.\n*   **Name Confusion:** The user may be confusing two different Nigerian presidents (Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe) or has encountered misinformation that conflates the two figures.\n*   **Defining \"Publicly Identify\":** This could mean many things, from a legal name change to using it as a nickname. However, there is no evidence for any form of public identification with the name \"Azikiwe\" by Goodluck Jonathan.\n*   **Providing a \"Null\" Answer:** Since the event described in the question never occurred, it is impossible to provide a year. The most accurate answer is to state that this has never happened.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBased on all available public records and biographical information, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full name does not include \"Azikiwe,\" and he has never publicly identified himself by that name. The question is based on a false premise. Therefore, a year cannot be given for an event that did not take place.\n\n<<<There is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, and \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name. Therefore, this event has never occurred.>>>"
