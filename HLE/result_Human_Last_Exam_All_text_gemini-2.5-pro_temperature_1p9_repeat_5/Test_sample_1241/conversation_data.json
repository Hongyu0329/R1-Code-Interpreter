    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This represents the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1. The given system of differential equations is the Kolmogorov-Chapman system for a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The steady-state probabilities, denoted by $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are the probabilities when the system reaches equilibrium, meaning the rate of change of probabilities is zero.\n\n**Step 2: Formulating the Steady-State Equations**\nTo find the steady-state probabilities, we set the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero in the given system of equations:\n$$\nP_i'(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i = 0, 1, 2, 3\n$$\nThis results in a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$:\n$$\n0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3} \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2} \\quad (3)\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3} \\quad (4)\n$$\nAdditionally, the probabilities must sum to 1, which provides the normalization condition:\n$$\n\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1 \\quad (5)\n$$\nNote that the sum of equations (1) through (4) results in $0=0$, indicating that they are linearly dependent. We can solve the system using any three of these equations along with the normalization equation (5). It is usually simplest to use the balance equations (1), (3), and (4).\n\n**Step 3: Substituting the Given Parameter Values**\nThe given values are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\nSubstituting these values into equations (1), (3), (4), and (5):\n$$\n0 = -0.019\\pi_{0} + 0.65\\pi_{1} \\quad (1')\n$$\n$$\n0 = 0.4\\pi_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_{2} \\quad (3')\n$$\n$$\n0 = 0.008\\pi_{2} - 0.008\\pi_{3} \\quad (4')\n$$\n$$\n\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1 \\quad (5')\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Solving the System of Linear Equations**\nLet's simplify equations (1'), (3'), and (4') to express $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\nFrom (4'):\n$$\n0.008\\pi_{2} = 0.008\\pi_{3} \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3\n$$\n\nFrom (3'):\n$$\n0.4\\pi_{1} - (0.4)\\pi_{2} = 0 \\implies 0.4\\pi_1 = 0.4\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2\n$$\nCombining these results, we get $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\nFrom (1'):\n$$\n0.019\\pi_{0} = 0.65\\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Using the Normalization Condition**\nNow substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5'):\n$$\n\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1\n$$\nCombine the terms with $\\pi_1$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right)\\pi_1 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{707}{19}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1\n$$\nSolving for $\\pi_1$:\n$$\n\\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}\n$$\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nWe know that $\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$. So, we can write:\n$$\n\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 1\\right)\\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{650 + 19}{19}\\right)\\pi_1 = \\frac{669}{19}\\pi_1\n$$\nNow, substitute the value we found for $\\pi_1$:\n$$\n\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{669}{19} \\times \\left(\\frac{19}{707}\\right) = \\frac{669}{707}\n$$\nThe fraction $\\frac{669}{707}$ cannot be simplified further. Its approximate decimal value is 0.94625.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n$\\pi_1 = 19/707$\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19} \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650+19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\nThe calculations are consistent.\n\n<<<669/707>>>"
