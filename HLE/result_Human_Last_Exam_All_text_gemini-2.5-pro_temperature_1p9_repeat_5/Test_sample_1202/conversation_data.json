    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks about the primary evolutionary mechanism that explains two key outcomes after a gene duplication event:\n1.  **Retention:** Why are both copies of the duplicated gene kept in the genome instead of one being lost?\n2.  **Divergence:** How do these two retained copies evolve to become different from each other over time?\nThe question emphasizes finding the \"most likely\" mechanism among the choices.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each answer choice.**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, resulting in the two sequences becoming identical or very similar. This process promotes homogenization within a gene family, which is the opposite of divergence. Therefore, it does not explain how duplicate genes diverge.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene. The redundant copy accumulates mutations that render it non-functional, turning it into a pseudogene. This process describes the *loss* of the duplicate gene's function, not its *retention* as a functional gene.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that after duplication, one copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy is free from selective pressure. This freedom allows it to accumulate mutations, one of which might luckily confer a completely new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Retention:** Both genes are kept because one performs the original, essential function, and the new copy performs a new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Divergence:** The second copy must accumulate mutations to gain a new function, causing it to diverge from the original.\n    *   **Likelihood:** This model is plausible, but it has a challenge. The period where the second copy is redundant and has no new function makes it highly susceptible to pseudogenization. The evolution of a new beneficial function is a rare event.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in different tissues or at different times (i.e., it was pleiotropic). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that inactivate different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function A but retains function B, while copy 2 loses function B but retains function A.\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies are now required to collectively perform the full range of functions of the single ancestral gene. Losing either copy would be detrimental, so natural selection favors keeping both.\n    *   **Divergence:** The two copies accumulate different mutations and evolve to specialize in their respective subfunctions.\n    *   **Likelihood:** This mechanism provides a rapid path to preserving both gene copies. It doesn't rely on a rare gain-of-function mutation. Instead, it relies on more common loss-of-function mutations happening in different parts of the two genes (e.g., in different regulatory elements). Because it provides an immediate selective advantage for keeping both copies, many researchers believe it is a very common, and thus \"most likely,\" mechanism for the initial retention of duplicates.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of species from a common ancestor to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a mechanism that operates at the level of genes within a genome to explain their retention and divergence. It describes a pattern of species evolution, not gene evolution.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the strongest candidates (C and D).**\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization** offers a more robust explanation for the initial preservation of the duplicate gene. The mutual dependency of the two copies arises quickly through relatively common degenerative mutations, protecting them both from being lost to pseudogenization.\n*   **Neofunctionalization** requires the redundant gene to survive long enough for a rare beneficial mutation to arise. During this waiting period, it is much more likely to be lost.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is often considered the more probable and common pathway for the initial retention of duplicated genes, which then allows for further divergence and potential later neofunctionalization.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the final answer.**\nBased on the analysis, subfunctionalization provides the most likely mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes because it offers a faster and more probable route to making both copies essential.\n\n<<<D>>>"
