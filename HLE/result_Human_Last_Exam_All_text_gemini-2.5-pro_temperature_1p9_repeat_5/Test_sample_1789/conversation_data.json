    "Answering this question involves determining the maximum possible size of a set formed by the union of 20 antichains within the poset $([1, N], |)$, where $N = 823564528378596$ and the relation is divisibility.\n\n### Step 1: Translating the problem using poset theory\n\nAn antichain in a poset is a set of elements where no two are related by the poset's order. In our case, an antichain $A$ is a subset of $[1, N]$ such that for any two distinct numbers $x, y \\in A$, neither $x|y$ nor $y|x$.\n\nWe are looking for the maximum size of a set $U = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup A_{20}$, where each $A_i$ is an antichain.\n\nA key theorem in poset theory is the dual of Dilworth's theorem (also known as Mirsky's theorem). It states that the minimum number of antichains needed to partition a set is equal to the length of the longest chain in that set. An extension of this implies that a set $U$ can be expressed as the union of $k$ antichains if and only if the longest chain in $U$ has a length of at most $k$.\n\nIn our problem, $k=20$. Therefore, we are looking for the largest subset of $[1, N]$ that does not contain a chain of length 21. A chain of length 21 is a sequence of integers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{21}$ such that $x_1 | x_2 | \\dots | x_{21}$ and all $x_i$ are distinct and in $[1, N]$.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying candidate sets\n\nFinding the exact size of the largest set with no chain of length $k+1$ in the divisor poset on $[1, N]$ is a famous open problem in combinatorial number theory. However, for such problems, the solution is often one of a few \"natural\" constructions. We will identify the most likely candidates and compare their sizes.\n\nTwo primary candidates for the largest set with no chain of length $k+1$ are:\n1.  **A set based on the number of prime factors:** Let $S_j = \\{n \\in [1, N] \\mid \\Omega(n) = j\\}$, where $\\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime factors of $n$ counted with multiplicity. Each $S_j$ is an antichain. A union of 20 such antichains, for example, $U_\\Omega = \\bigcup_{j=0}^{19} S_j = \\{n \\in [1, N] \\mid \\Omega(n) < 20\\}$, will not have a chain of length 21 (as any chain requires elements from distinct $S_j$ with increasing indices).\n2.  **A set based on excluding small numbers:** Consider the set $U_2 = \\{n \\in [1, N] \\mid n > \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor \\}$. Let's check the maximum chain length in this set. Let $x_1, \\dots, x_m$ be a chain in $U_2$. Then $x_1 > \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$. Since $x_i | x_{i+1}$ and $x_i \\neq x_{i+1}$, we must have $x_{i+1} \\ge 2x_i$. This implies $x_m \\ge 2^{m-1}x_1$.\n    If the chain had length $m=21$, then $x_{21} \\ge 2^{20} x_1$.\n    $x_1 \\ge \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor + 1$.\n    So, $x_{21} \\ge 2^{20}(\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor + 1) = 2^{20}\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor + 2^{20}$.\n    Using the inequality $\\lfloor x \\rfloor > x-1$, we have $\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor > N/2^{20} - 1$.\n    Thus, $x_{21} > 2^{20}(N/2^{20} - 1) + 2^{20} = (N - 2^{20}) + 2^{20} = N$.\n    This means $x_{21}$ cannot be in the set $[1, N]$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the longest chain in $U_2$ has length at most 20.\n\n### Step 3: Comparing the sizes of the candidate sets\n\nNow we compare the sizes of $U_\\Omega$ and $U_2$.\n$|U_2| = N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n$|U_\\Omega| = N - |\\{n \\in [1, N] \\mid \\Omega(n) \\ge 20\\}|$.\n\nTo determine which set is larger, we need to compare the number of elements excluded by each construction. Let $E_1 = [1, \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor]$ and $E_2 = \\{n \\in [1, N] \\mid \\Omega(n) \\ge 20\\}$.\nWe need to compare $|E_1|$ and $|E_2|$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate $|E_1|$:\n$N = 823564528378596$\n$2^{20} = 1,048,576$\n$N/2^{20} = 823564528378596 / 1048576 \\approx 785412.3$\n$|E_1| = \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor = 785,412$.\n\nNext, let's analyze $|E_2|$. The elements of $E_2$ are integers $n \\le N$ with at least 20 prime factors (counted with multiplicity). The smallest integer with 20 prime factors is $2^{20} = 1,048,576$.\nTherefore, any number $n \\in E_2$ must be at least $1,048,576$.\nThis shows that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are disjoint sets.\n\nMore importantly, this observation allows us to determine which set, $U_2$ or $U_\\Omega$, is larger. Let's compare their complements $U_2^c=E_1$ and $U_\\Omega^c=E_2$.\nIf $n \\in E_2$, then $\\Omega(n) \\ge 20$, which implies $n \\ge 2^{20} = 1,048,576$.\nWe know $|E_1| = 785,412$.\nSince any element of $E_2$ is greater than $1,048,576$, all elements of $E_2$ are larger than any element of $E_1$.\n\nLet's estimate $|E_2|$. The set $E_2$ contains, for example, all numbers of the form $2^{18} \\cdot 3 \\cdot p$ where $p$ is a prime such that this product is $\\le N$. The number of such integers is approximately $\\pi(N/(2^{18} \\cdot 3)) = \\pi(8.235\\dots\\times 10^{14}/786432) \\approx \\pi(1.04\\times 10^9)$, which is approximately $5 \\times 10^7$. This is a rough lower bound and already indicates that $|E_2|$ is much larger than $|E_1|$.\nSince $|E_2| > |E_1|$, the set that excludes fewer elements is $U_2$.\nTherefore, $|U_2| = N-|E_1| > N-|E_2| = |U_\\Omega|$.\n\nThis makes $U_2$ the larger of the two candidates, and it is the standard conjecture for the correct answer in this unsolved problem. Given the nature of the question, it's highly probable that this is the intended answer.\n\n### Step 4: Final calculation\n\nThe size of the largest union of 20 antichains is given by the size of the set $U_2$.\nSize = $N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$\nSize = $823564528378596 - 785412$\n\nLet's perform the subtraction carefully:\n  823,564,528,378,596\n-                 785,412\n---------------------------\n  823,564,527,593,184\n\nSo, the size of the largest union of 20 antichains is 823,564,527,593,184."
