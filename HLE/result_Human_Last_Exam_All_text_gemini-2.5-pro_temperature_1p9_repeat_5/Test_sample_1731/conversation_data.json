    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons).\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting the Role of Large Deviation Theorems\n\nThe question asks to use the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff large deviation theorems. In the context of statistical mechanics, these theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles used to determine equilibrium states.\n\n*   **Conceptual Link:** Large Deviation Theory (LDT) quantifies the probability of macroscopic properties (like energy density or particle distribution) deviating from their average values. The probability of observing a particular macroscopic state decays exponentially with the number of particles (or system size), governed by a \"rate function\".\n    *   $P(\\text{macrostate}) \\approx e^{-N \\times (\\text{rate function})}$\n*   **Connection to Entropy (Boltzmann-Sanov):** The statistical definition of entropy is $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the number of microstates for a given macrostate. Thus, the probability of a macrostate is proportional to $e^{S/k_B}$. Comparing this with the LDT form, we see that the rate function is directly related to the negative of entropy per particle: $(\\text{rate function}) \\propto -S/N$. Maximizing entropy is equivalent to minimizing the rate function. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, which deals with empirical distributions, leads to a rate function that corresponds to the specific entropy formula for the statistics in question (in this case, Bose-Einstein statistics).\n*   **Connection to Free Energy (Cramér-Chernoff):** For a system in contact with a heat bath at temperature $T$ (a canonical ensemble), the probability of the system having energy $E$ and entropy $S(E)$ is given by $P(E) \\propto \\Omega(E) e^{-E/k_B T} = e^{S(E)/k_B - E/k_B T} = e^{-F/k_B T}$, where $F = E - TS$ is the Helmholtz free energy. The Cramér-Chernoff theorem, dealing with the mean of many random variables (like total energy), has a rate function that corresponds to the free energy. The equilibrium state, being the most probable one, is the state that minimizes the rate function, which means minimizing the free energy $F$.\n\nTherefore, the instruction to use these theorems directs us to find the equilibrium state by minimizing the Helmholtz free energy for the photon gas.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Expressions for E, S, and F\n\nFor a gas of bosons (photons), we consider the distribution of particles over energy levels $\\epsilon_i$, where each level has $g_i$ states.\n\n1.  **Macrostate Definition:** A macrostate is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{N_i\\}$, or more conveniently by the average occupation per state, $x_i = N_i/g_i$.\n\n2.  **Energy (E):** The total energy of the system is the sum of energies of all particles:\n    $E = \\sum_i N_i \\epsilon_i = \\sum_i g_i x_i \\epsilon_i$\n\n3.  **Entropy (S):** For indistinguishable bosons, the number of ways to arrange $N_i$ particles in $g_i$ states is $\\binom{N_i+g_i-1}{N_i}$. Using Stirling's approximation, the total entropy is:\n    $S/k_B = \\sum_i \\left[ (N_i+g_i)\\ln(N_i+g_i) - N_i\\ln N_i - g_i\\ln g_i \\right]$\n    In terms of the occupation per state $x_i = N_i/g_i$, this simplifies to:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (x_i+1)\\ln(x_i+1) - x_i\\ln x_i \\right]$\n\n4.  **Helmholtz Free Energy (F):** For a system at temperature T, the Helmholtz free energy is $F = E - TS$.\n    $F(\\{x_i\\}) = \\sum_i g_i x_i \\epsilon_i - k_B T \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (x_i+1)\\ln(x_i+1) - x_i\\ln x_i \\right]$\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution\n\nTo find the equilibrium state, we minimize the free energy $F$ with respect to each occupation number $x_j$. For photons, the total number of particles is not conserved, so we do not have a conservation constraint on $\\sum N_i$.\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_j} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( g_j x_j \\epsilon_j - k_B T g_j \\left[ (x_j+1)\\ln(x_j+1) - x_j\\ln x_j \\right] \\right) = 0$\n$g_j \\epsilon_j - k_B T g_j \\left[ (\\ln(x_j+1)+1) - (\\ln x_j+1) \\right] = 0$\n$\\epsilon_j - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_j+1}{x_j}\\right) = 0$\n$\\frac{\\epsilon_j}{k_B T} = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x_j}\\right)$\n$e^{\\epsilon_j/k_B T} - 1 = \\frac{1}{x_j}$\n\nThis gives the equilibrium occupation per state, which is the Planck distribution function for bosons with zero chemical potential:\n$\\bar{x}_i = \\frac{1}{e^{\\epsilon_i/k_B T} - 1}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe mean energy $E$ is found by substituting the equilibrium distribution $\\bar{x}_i$ into the energy formula and integrating over all possible energies. We must use the density of states for photons in a 3D volume $V$, which accounts for two polarization states:\n$g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n\n$E = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\bar{x}(\\epsilon) \\cdot g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\epsilon/k_B T} - 1} \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n$E = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\epsilon/k_B T} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n\nLet $u = \\epsilon/(k_B T)$, so $\\epsilon = u k_B T$ and $d\\epsilon = k_B T du$.\n$E = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} (k_B T)^4 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{u^3}{e^u - 1} du$\n\nThe definite integral is a standard result related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{u^3}{e^u - 1} du = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n\nSubstituting this value gives the mean energy (the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy):\n$E = \\frac{8\\pi V (k_B T)^4}{h^3 c^3} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy\n\nWe can find the equilibrium entropy by substituting $\\bar{x}_i$ back into the entropy formula. However, a simpler method is to use the thermodynamic relation for a photon gas. The Helmholtz free energy $F = E - TS$ is also related to the pressure $P$ by $F = -PV$. For a photon gas (an ultra-relativistic gas), the equation of state is $P = E/(3V)$.\n\nTherefore, $E-TS = -PV = -E/3$.\n$TS = E - (-E/3) = \\frac{4E}{3}$\n$S = \\frac{4E}{3T}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the equilibrium energy $E$:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right)$\n$S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\nThese are the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}, S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}}$.\n<<<**Equilibrium Mean Energy:** $E = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:** $S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$>>>"
