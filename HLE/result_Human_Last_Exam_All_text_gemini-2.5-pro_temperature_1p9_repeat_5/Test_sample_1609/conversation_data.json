    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables, denoted as a(4).\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Prime Implicants**\n\n*   A **Boolean function** of `n` variables maps `n` binary inputs to a single binary output. It can be represented as a sum of minterms (Sum of Products form).\n*   An **implicant** of a function is a product term (e.g., `x₁x₂'`) that, if true, implies the function is true. In a Karnaugh map (K-map), an implicant corresponds to a rectangular grouping of 1s.\n*   A **prime implicant** (PI) is an implicant that cannot be simplified further by removing any literal. In a K-map, this corresponds to a rectangular grouping of 1s that is not fully contained within any single larger rectangular grouping of 1s.\n*   We are looking for `a(n)`, which is the maximum number of PIs any function of `n` variables can possibly have. We need to find `a(4)`.\n\n**Step 2: Relating the Problem to Graph Theory**\n\nTo maximize the number of prime implicants, we can try to create a function where very little simplification is possible. The most extreme case of this is a function where every \"1\" (minterm) in its K-map is isolated from every other \"1\". If no two 1s are adjacent, they cannot be grouped together, and each individual minterm becomes its own prime implicant.\n\nThis problem can be modeled using an n-dimensional hypercube graph, `Qₙ`:\n*   **Vertices:** The `2ⁿ` vertices correspond to the `2ⁿ` possible minterms (binary strings of length n).\n*   **Edges:** An edge connects two vertices if their corresponding binary strings differ in exactly one position (i.e., their Hamming distance is 1). This corresponds to adjacency in a K-map.\n\nA function where no two minterms are adjacent corresponds to an **independent set** in the `Qₙ` graph. An independent set is a set of vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge. Our goal is to find the size of the largest possible independent set in `Q₄`, denoted `α(Q₄)`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of the n-Hypercube**\n\nThe n-hypercube graph `Qₙ` has a special property: it is **bipartite**. This means its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other.\n\n*   **Set 1 (V_even):** All vertices (minterms) with an even number of 1s in their binary representation (even parity).\n*   **Set 2 (V_odd):** All vertices (minterms) with an odd number of 1s in their binary representation (odd parity).\n\nChanging a single bit in a binary string always changes its parity (from even to odd, or odd to even). Therefore, any edge in `Qₙ` must connect a vertex from `V_even` to one from `V_odd`. There are no edges within `V_even` or within `V_odd`.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Maximum Independent Set**\n\nSince there are no edges within `V_even`, the entire set `V_even` is an independent set. Similarly, `V_odd` is also an independent set. For any bipartite graph, the maximum independent set is simply the larger of the two partitions.\n\n*   The total number of vertices in `Qₙ` is `2ⁿ`.\n*   The number of vertices in `V_even` is `2ⁿ⁻¹`.\n*   The number of vertices in `V_odd` is `2ⁿ⁻¹`.\n\nSince both partitions have the same size, the size of the maximum independent set in `Qₙ` is `α(Qₙ) = 2ⁿ⁻¹`. This gives us the maximal number of prime implicants: `a(n) = 2ⁿ⁻¹`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating a(4)**\n\nNow we can apply this formula for `n=4`:\n*   `a(4) = 2⁴⁻¹`\n*   `a(4) = 2³`\n*   `a(4) = 8`\n\n**Careful Points & Confirmation:**\n*   A common incorrect guess might be `C(4, 2) = 6`, which is the maximum number of minterms of a single \"weight\" (number of 1s). While the function containing all minterms of weight 2 has 6 prime implicants, it's not the maximum.\n*   To confirm our result, we can construct the function for `n=4` that yields 8 prime implicants. We select all minterms with an even number of 1s:\n    *   Weight 0: `0000` (1 minterm)\n    *   Weight 2: `0011`, `0101`, `0110`, `1001`, `1010`, `1100` (6 minterms)\n    *   Weight 4: `1111` (1 minterm)\n*   This gives a total of `1 + 6 + 1 = 8` minterms. Since any two of these differ by at least two bits, none are adjacent. Therefore, each of these 8 minterms is a prime implicant, confirming that `a(4)=8` is achievable. It is also the maximum because the size of the maximum independent set in `Q₄` is 8.\n\nThe maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
