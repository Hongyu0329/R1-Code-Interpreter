    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Key Terms:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical concept. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (a trait like height or disease risk) that can be explained by the combined additive effects of *all* single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being considered, typically all common SNPs across the genome. It is the theoretical maximum predictive power you could achieve if you knew the *true* effect of every single SNP and could combine them perfectly.\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool. It is a number calculated for an individual to estimate their genetic predisposition for a phenotype. It is created by taking a weighted sum of their genotypes at many SNPs. The weights (effect sizes) are *estimated* from a large-scale genetic study, usually a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n    *   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This measures how well the PGS actually works in practice. It is typically quantified by the R-squared (R²) statistic, which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS when tested in a *new, independent* group of people (a \"target\" or \"testing\" sample).\n\n2.  **Compare the Concepts:**\n    *   SNP heritability is the *ceiling*. It's the total amount of signal available from the SNPs.\n    *   A PGS is the *attempt to capture* that signal.\n    *   The predictive ability (R²) is the measure of *how much signal was successfully captured* by the PGS.\n\n3.  **Identify Sources of Information Loss:** The reason why the predictive ability of a PGS is lower than the SNP heritability is due to several unavoidable real-world limitations and sources of error in its construction. These guarantee that the PGS will be an imperfect predictor.\n    *   **Estimation Error:** The weights used in the PGS are derived from a GWAS with a finite sample size. This means the estimated effect sizes are noisy and not the true effect sizes. This \"error in the weights\" directly reduces the accuracy of the resulting PGS.\n    *   **Incomplete Information:** GWASs have limited statistical power. They cannot detect the tiny effects of all causal SNPs. SNPs that do not reach a certain level of statistical significance are often excluded or down-weighted in the PGS model, meaning part of the genetic signal is lost.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Mismatch:** Genes are inherited in blocks. LD describes the non-random association of alleles at different loci. A PGS is built using a discovery sample (e.g., people of European ancestry) and then tested in a target sample. If the patterns of LD differ between these two samples (which is common, especially across different ancestries), the predictive accuracy will decrease.\n    *   **Non-Additive Effects and Model Misspecification:** Standard PGS and SNP heritability calculations are based on a simple additive model. If the true genetic architecture involves complex interactions (epistasis), this simple model will not capture all the genetic variance, limiting the performance of the PGS.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Conclusion:**\n    Because a PGS is an *imperfect estimate* of the true, total genetic effect (which is what SNP heritability represents), its predictive performance will necessarily be lower than this theoretical maximum. To put it another way, the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the upper bound for the predictive R² of any possible PGS built from those SNPs.\n    *   **Mathematical Analogy:** `h²_SNP` is the variance of the true signal. `PGS R²` is the variance explained by a noisy version of that signal. A noisy signal will always explain less variance than the true, clean signal.\n\n5.  **Final Verdict:** The statement posits that `PGS R²` is *necessarily* lower than `h²_SNP`. Given that it is practically impossible to eliminate all sources of error (e.g., you can never have an infinitely large GWAS sample to get perfect effect size estimates), the predictive ability of any real-world PGS will always be a fraction of the total SNP heritability. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Theory vs. Practice:** SNP heritability is a theoretical maximum. The PGS's predictive ability is an empirical, practical measurement. Practice rarely, if ever, achieves the theoretical maximum.\n*   **The Role of Overfitting:** If the PGS were tested on the same data it was trained on, its R² could be artificially inflated. Proper methodology requires testing in a completely independent dataset, which avoids this problem and is the standard for reporting predictive ability.\n*   **Estimates vs. True Values:** We can only *estimate* SNP heritability, and this estimate has its own error. However, the statement refers to the *true* SNP heritability as the benchmark. The R² from a PGS can serve as a *lower bound* for the true SNP heritability (i.e., we know `h²_SNP` must be at least as large as the R² we observed).\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the statement is correct.\n\n<<<True>>>"
