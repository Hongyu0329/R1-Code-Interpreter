    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the novel and its author:** The question refers to the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by the Polish science fiction author Jacek Dukaj.\n\n2.  **Identify the main character:** The protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a human from the 21st century who has been resurrected in the far future.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main character's relationships:** Throughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski's most significant and defining relationship is with a post-human entity from a powerful civilization. This being acts as his guide, protector, and partner in the complex new reality he finds himself in.\n\n4.  **Identify the partner's name:** This powerful post-human being, a member of the \"stahs\" species, is known by the name Angel.\n\n5.  **Confirm the nature of their relationship (marriage):** The bond between Adam Zamoyski and Angel evolves into a deep, formal, and symbiotic union. Within the context of the story, this union is the equivalent of a marriage, formally binding them together. While the concept of \"marriage\" is transformed in this far-future setting, Angel is unequivocally the character that Adam Zamoyski forms this ultimate partnership with.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Protagonist:** It's essential to correctly identify the main character as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   **The partner's identity:** The partner is not a conventional human but a post-human being called a \"stahs\". Her name is consistently referred to as Angel.\n*   **The concept of \"marriage\":** The question uses the word \"marries.\" In the context of a far-future sci-fi novel, this may not be a traditional ceremony, but the formal, binding, and romantic union between Adam and Angel is the direct plot equivalent.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the character the protagonist marries is Angel.\n\n<<<Angel>>>"
