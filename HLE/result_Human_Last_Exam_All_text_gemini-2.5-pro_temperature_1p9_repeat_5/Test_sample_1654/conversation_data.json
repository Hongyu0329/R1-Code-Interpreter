    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Chekov describes Otchumyelov's coat.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks for the number of times Anton Chekov describes the coat of the police superintendent, Otchumyelov, in \"The Chameleon.\" The description is not just about the coat's physical appearance but more importantly, about the actions of Otchumyelov taking it off and putting it on, which symbolize his shifting mentality based on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Definition of \"Description\":** In this context, \"description\" refers to any mention of the coat that highlights its state or Otchumyelov's interaction with it. This includes the initial description of him wearing it, as well as the repeated actions of removing and donning it.\n2.  **The Symbolism:** Each action involving the coat is a deliberate choice by Chekov to reveal Otchumyelov's character. Taking it off signifies a feeling of superiority and heat (anger/bluster), while putting it on signifies a feeling of subservience and a \"chill\" (fear/deference) when faced with a potential superior.\n3.  **Chronological Tracking:** The most effective way to answer is to read through the story chronologically and count each instance where the coat is mentioned as part of the action.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer\n\nLet's trace the mentions of the coat through the story's plot:\n\n1.  **First Instance:** At the very beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced as he walks across the market square. Chekov writes that he is \"in a new overcoat.\" This is the initial description that sets the scene.\n2.  **Second Instance:** After Otchumyelov begins his inquiry and it's first suggested that the dog belongs to General Zhigalov, he feels suddenly hot from the pressure and his shift in attitude. He says, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\" He **takes the coat off**.\n3.  **Third Instance:** A moment later, someone in the crowd says the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov immediately feels a \"chill.\" He instructs his subordinate, \"Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin... there's a wind getting up.\" He **puts the coat back on**.\n4.  **Fourth Instance:** The policeman Yeldyrin speculates that it might still be the General's dog, as he has seen a similar one in the General's yard. This renewed uncertainty makes Otchumyelov hot again. \"H'm... Take off my coat, Yeldyrin... It's terribly hot!\" He **takes the coat off again**.\n5.  **Fifth Instance:** The General's cook, Prokhor, arrives and states definitively that the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov, again feeling the \"chill\" of having potentially offended an ordinary person, says, \"Put my coat on, Yeldyrin, my lad...\" He **puts the coat on once more**.\n6.  **Sixth Instance:** The story reaches its climax when the cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother, who has just arrived in town. Otchumyelov's demeanor changes completely to one of fawning delight. As he leaves the scene, Chekov gives the final description: \"Wrapping himself in his greatcoat, he goes on his way through the market-place.\" This final action signifies his \"chameleon\" nature settling on its final colour for the encounter.\n\nCounting these distinct instances gives us a total of six descriptions or symbolic actions involving the coat.\n\n<<<6>>>"
