    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Algorithm's Purpose**\nThe algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` converts a non-negative integer `n` into its base `c` representation. It does this by repeatedly dividing `n` by the base `c` and recording the remainders. For example, to convert 13 to base 2, it would perform:\n- 13 / 2 = 6 remainder 1 (`a_0`)\n- 6 / 2 = 3 remainder 0 (`a_1`)\n- 3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1 (`a_2`)\n- 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1 (`a_3`)\nThe result is `(1101)_2`. The algorithm computes these digits `a_i` starting from `a_0`.\n\n**2. Break Down the Algorithm into Basic Operations**\nWe analyze the cost of each step of the algorithm.\n\n*   **Step 1: Initialization**\n    - `i := 0; x := n;` (Two assignment operations)\n    - `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (One division operation)\n    - `a_{0} := x — qc;` (One multiplication and one subtraction operation)\n    This step involves a fixed number of basic arithmetic operations. Assuming these operations take constant time (which is a standard assumption in this context, known as the uniform cost model), the time complexity of the initialization step is **O(1)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: The `while` loop**\n    This is the core of the algorithm. Its total running time is the number of iterations multiplied by the time taken for each iteration.\n    *   **Inside the loop (Step 2.1):**\n        - `i := i + 1;` (One addition)\n        - `x := q;` (One assignment)\n        - `q :=. ⌊x/c⌋;` (One division)\n        - `a_{i} := x — qc` (One multiplication and one subtraction)\n        Similar to the initialization step, the body of the loop consists of a constant number of basic operations. Therefore, each iteration of the loop takes **O(1)** time.\n    *   **Number of iterations:**\n        The complexity of the loop depends on how many times it executes. The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's track the value of `q`.\n        - Before the loop starts: `q_{initial} = ⌊n/c⌋`\n        - After 1st iteration: `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`. The new `q` is `q_1 = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        - After 2nd iteration: The new `q` is `q_2 = ⌊q_1/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n        - After *k* iterations: The value of `q` becomes `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n        The loop will terminate when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`.\n        The condition `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0` is true if and only if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`.\n        This can be rewritten as `n < c^(k+1)`.\n        Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives: `log_c(n) < k + 1`, or `k > log_c(n) - 1`.\n        The number of iterations, `k`, is essentially the number of times we can divide `n` by `c` until the result is less than `c`. This number is directly related to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`, which is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times (for `n≥1`).\n        For example, if `n=13, c=2`, then `log_2(13) ≈ 3.7`. The loop runs `⌊3.7⌋ = 3` times.\n        Thus, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The total time for the `while` loop is `(Number of iterations) × (Time per iteration) = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) =` **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Return**\n    - `return ((a_i, ..., a_0))`\n    This step simply returns the computed result. This is an **O(1)** operation.\n\n**3. Combine the complexities**\nThe total computational time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n`T(n) = T_initialization + T_loop + T_return`\n`T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(1)`\nThe dominant term is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the while loop. Since the value of `n` is effectively divided by `c` in each step, the loop runs for a number of times proportional to the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes a uniform cost model, where basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numbers that fit within a computer's word size take constant `O(1)` time. This is a standard convention for algorithm analysis unless dealing with arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n2.  **Loop Variable:** The key to the analysis is understanding how the variable `q` changes. It decreases geometrically with a ratio of `c`.\n3.  **Number of Iterations:** The number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` for `n ≥ 1`, which is the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n`, minus one.\n4.  **Base of Logarithm:** The complexity is `O(log_c n)`. In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm can often be omitted because `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`, and `1/log_b(c)` is just a constant factor if `c` is constant. However, since `c` is an input parameter to the algorithm, `O(log_c n)` is the more precise answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{O(\\log_c n)}$.\n\n<<<O(log_c n)>>>"
