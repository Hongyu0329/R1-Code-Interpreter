    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra (also known as star polyhedra). It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. A key feature is that its faces pass through its interior, making it non-convex.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe \"outer-hull\" or \"convex hull\" of a polyhedron is the smallest convex polyhedron that contains all of its vertices. Imagine stretching a shrink-wrap film over the entire object; the shape this film takes is the convex hull. For the great icosahedron, we need to find the convex polyhedron formed by its 12 vertices.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Great Icosahedron to a Simpler Shape**\nThe 12 vertices of the great icosahedron have the exact same spatial arrangement as the 12 vertices of a **regular icosahedron**. A regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids, and it is a convex polyhedron. Since the vertices are in the same positions, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Surface of the Outer-Hull (the Regular Icosahedron)**\nThe question asks for the number of triangles needed to triangulate the surface of this outer-hull.\n*   The outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n*   By definition, a regular icosahedron is composed of 20 identical faces.\n*   Each of these 20 faces is an equilateral triangle.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Minimal Number of Triangles**\nThe process of \"triangulating\" a surface means dividing it into triangles.\n*   The surface of the regular icosahedron is already perfectly divided into its 20 triangular faces.\n*   This is the most natural and minimal way to triangulate the surface. Any further subdivision (e.g., splitting each triangle in half) would result in a greater number of triangles (e.g., 40).\n*   Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to form the surface of the outer-hull is simply the number of faces of the regular icosahedron.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of visible triangles from the outside corresponds to the number of faces on the convex hull. The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron, which has 20 triangular faces. Thus, the minimal number of triangles required is 20.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Do not confuse the self-intersecting faces of the great icosahedron (there are 20) with the faces of its convex hull. The question is about the \"outer-hull\" or the \"visible\" surface.\n*   Recognize that the vertices of the great icosahedron and the regular icosahedron are arranged identically, making their convex hulls the same shape.\n*   Understand that \"minimal triangulation\" for a shape already made of triangles is simply the count of its own triangular faces.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n1.  Object: Great Icosahedron\n2.  Outer-Hull (Convex Hull) of the Great Icosahedron: Regular Icosahedron\n3.  Faces of a Regular Icosahedron: 20 equilateral triangles\n4.  Minimal triangulation of this surface is the set of its own faces.\n5.  Minimal number of triangles = 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
