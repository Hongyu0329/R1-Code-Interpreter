    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Edge Squares**\nA standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid, containing a total of 64 squares. The edge squares are those on the first and last rows (rank 1 and rank 8) and the first and last columns (file 'a' and file 'h').\n*   Number of squares on rank 1: 8\n*   Number of squares on rank 8: 8\n*   Number of squares on file 'a' (excluding the two corners already counted): 6\n*   Number of squares on file 'h' (excluding the two corners already counted): 6\nTotal number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Movement and Attack**\nIn chess, a bishop attacks any square along the same diagonal. A crucial point is that a bishop always stays on squares of the same color it starts on. This means a bishop on a white square can only attack other bishops on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other bishops on black squares.\n\n**Step 3: Divide the Problem by Color**\nBecause bishops on different colored squares cannot attack each other, we can maximize the number of bishops on the white edge squares and the black edge squares independently. Then, we can sum the results to find the total maximum number of bishops.\nOf the 28 edge squares, exactly half are white and half are black.\n*   Number of white edge squares = 14.\n*   Number of black edge squares = 14.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\nOur goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the 14 available white edge squares. A simple and effective configuration is to place bishops on all the white squares of the 'a' file and 'h' file.\n*   White squares on the 'a' file: a1, a3, a5, a7.\n*   White squares on the 'h' file: h2, h4, h6, h8.\nLet's see if we can place bishops on all 8 of these squares.\n*   A bishop on a1 attacks h8 (they are on the same long diagonal).\n*   No other pairs among these 8 squares attack each other. For a bishop at (rank, file) `(r1, a)` to attack `(r2, h)`, the condition `|r1 - r2| = |a - h|` must hold. Since `a` is the 1st file and `h` is the 8th, we need `|r1 - r2| = |1 - 8| = 7`. The only pairs of ranks that satisfy this are (1, 8) and (8, 1). So, a1 attacks h8, and a8 would attack h1 (but a8 and h1 are black squares, so this is not relevant for this step).\nTo resolve the conflict between the bishop at a1 and the one at h8, we must remove one. Let's remove the bishop from h8.\nThis gives us a non-attacking set of bishops on {a1, a3, a5, a7, h2, h4, h6}. This is a total of 7 bishops on white edge squares. This configuration is maximal; it can be proven that it's not possible to place more than 7.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\nBy symmetry, the same logic applies to the 14 black edge squares. We can place bishops on the black squares of the 'a' and 'h' files.\n*   Black squares on 'a' file: a2, a4, a6, a8.\n*   Black squares on 'h' file: h1, h3, h5, h7.\nHere, a bishop at a8 attacks a bishop at h1 (`|8 - 1| = |1 - 8| = 7`). We must remove one, for example, the one at h1.\nThis gives a non-attacking set of bishops on {a2, a4, a6, a8, h3, h5, h7}. This is a total of 7 bishops on black edge squares.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops and Empty Squares**\n*   Maximum bishops on white edge squares = 7.\n*   Maximum bishops on black edge squares = 7.\nSince the two sets do not interact, the total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is the sum:\nTotal Bishops = 7 + 7 = 14.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Total number of bishops placed = 14.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total Edge Squares - Total Bishops Placed\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
