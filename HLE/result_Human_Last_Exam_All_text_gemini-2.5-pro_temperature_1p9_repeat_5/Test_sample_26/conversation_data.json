    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object**\nLet $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   The ambient space is the complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, which is a 3-dimensional complex manifold (6-dimensional real manifold).\n*   A hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is defined by the vanishing of a single homogeneous polynomial $F(Z_0, Z_1, Z_2, Z_3) = 0$.\n*   \"Quintic\" means the degree of the polynomial $F$ is $d=5$.\n*   The complex dimension of $X$ is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\mathbb{CP}^3) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$. So, $X$ is a complex surface. As a real manifold, its dimension is 4.\n*   \"Smooth\" means that $X$ is a manifold.\n\n**Step 2: Basic topological invariants of X**\nWe can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to relate the topology of $X$ to that of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   **Homotopy groups:** The inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X)-1=2-1=1$. With more advanced versions (or by a connectivity argument), this extends to show that for a smooth hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n\\geq 3$, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$.\n    *   Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = \\{1\\}$, we have $\\pi_1(X) = \\{1\\}$. So $X$ is simply connected.\n*   **Homology groups:** The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for homology states that the inclusion map induces isomorphisms $H_k(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3;\\mathbb{Z})$ for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$.\n    *   $H_0(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_0(\\mathbb{CP}^3;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ (path-connected).\n    *   $H_1(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This is consistent with $\\pi_1(X)=0$.\n    *   For $k=2$, the map $i_*: H_2(X) \\to H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is surjective. For a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^n$, the Picard group is $\\text{Pic}(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \\ge 3$. As $X$ is a surface, $\\text{Pic}(X) \\cong H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. Thus $H^2(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $X$ is a 4-dimensional orientable manifold, by Poincaré duality, $H_2(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^2(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **Connecting Homotopy and Homology:** Since $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$), the Hurewicz theorem gives an isomorphism $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X;\\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$**\nWe analyze the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ using its relation to homology via the Hurewicz theorem.\n*   First, we compute the third homology group $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. By Poincaré duality on the 4-manifold $X$, we have $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^{4-3}(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The universal coefficient theorem states that $H^1(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(X;\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}(H_0(X;\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_1(X;\\mathbb{Z})=0$ and $H_0(X;\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$ (which is free), we have $H^1(X;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   Therefore, $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   Now we consider the Hurewicz homomorphism $h_3: \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. Since the target group is trivial, this map is the zero map.\n*   For a simply connected space, there is an exact sequence known as the Hurewicz exact sequence:\n    $$ \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) \\xrightarrow{w} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{h_3} H_3(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0 $$\n    Here $\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor applied to the group $\\pi_2(X)$, and the map $w$ is given by the Whitehead product.\n*   Since $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, the sequence implies that the map $w$ is surjective, i.e., $\\pi_3(X)$ is the quotient of $\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$.\n*   We found that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The functor $\\Gamma$ on $\\mathbb{Z}$ is known to be $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Let $g$ be a generator of $\\pi_2(X)$, then $\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$ is the infinite cyclic group generated by $w(g) = [g,g]$, the Whitehead self-product of $g$.\n*   So, we have a surjection $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_3(X)$. This means that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a cyclic group. Its rank can be either 0 (if it's a finite group) or 1 (if it's $\\mathbb{Z}$).\n\n**Step 4: Determine if the rank is 0 or 1**\nTo determine the rank, we need to know if the kernel of the surjection $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_3(X)$ is trivial or not. This is a subtle point in the homotopy theory of algebraic varieties.\n*   There is a known result in this area (e.g., from a theorem by F. Cohen and P. F. Cohen, further developed by others) that for an algebraic surface $S$, the Whitehead product map $w: \\Gamma(\\pi_2 S) \\to \\pi_3 S$ is injective, unless the surface $S$ is rational or ruled.\n*   Our surface $X$ is a quintic surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. Its canonical bundle is $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}(5-4)|_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(1)$, which is ample. Surfaces with ample canonical bundle are of general type.\n*   A surface of general type is not rational and not ruled.\n*   Therefore, for our surface $X$, the map $w: \\Gamma(\\pi_2 X) \\to \\pi_3 X$ is an injection.\n*   Since we already established that this map is a surjection, it must be an isomorphism.\n*   This gives us $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The rank of a group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The rank of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is 1, as $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$, which is a 1-dimensional $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space.\n\nTherefore, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1."
