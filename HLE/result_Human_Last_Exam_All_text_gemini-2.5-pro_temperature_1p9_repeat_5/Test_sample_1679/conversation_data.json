    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the core question**\n\nThe goal is to find a specific film that meets three criteria:\n1.  It won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It depicts a \"Luxor Obelisk\".\n3.  It was the *first* film to meet both criteria above, based on the year it won the award.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\"**\n\nThis is a crucial point. The term \"Luxor Obelisk\" refers to a pair of ancient Egyptian obelisks carved in the reign of Ramesses II for the Luxor Temple. It's important to know their current locations:\n*   One obelisk remains in its original position at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in **Luxor, Egypt**.\n*   The other obelisk was gifted to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\n\nTherefore, the film we are looking for must depict a scene in either Luxor, Egypt (at the Temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n\n### **Step 3: Chronologically review Best Picture winners for relevant locations**\n\nWe need to go through the list of Best Picture winners year by year, starting from the first ceremony (for films of 1927/1928), and check their settings.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Early winners like *Wings* (1927/28), *The Broadway Melody* (1928/29), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30), *It Happened One Night* (1934), and *Gone with the Wind* (1939) are set primarily in the USA or WWI battlefields and do not feature either location.\n*   **A potential early candidate:** *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937). This film is set in late 19th-century France and deals with the Dreyfus Affair in Paris. While it is set in Paris, its major public scenes (like the public degradation of Dreyfus) take place at the Ã‰cole Militaire, not the Place de la Concorde. A review of the film shows it primarily uses interiors and sets, and does not feature a prominent scene at the Place de la Concorde showing the obelisk.\n*   **1940s:** Winners like *Rebecca* (1940), *Casablanca* (1942), and *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946) are set in England, Morocco, and the USA, respectively. None depict the required locations.\n*   **1950s:** This decade presents strong candidates.\n    *   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** This musical is set entirely in Paris. Its famous, 17-minute concluding ballet sequence is a stylized journey through the city, designed in the style of various French painters. One distinct segment of this ballet is set in the **Place de la Concorde** (in the style of Raoul Dufy), where the **Luxor Obelisk is clearly and centrally depicted** alongside the famous fountains. This is a very strong and definitive candidate.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** The film's journey begins in London, briefly passes through Paris, and later goes through Egypt via the Suez Canal. The route does not include a stop in the city of Luxor, so the obelisk in Egypt is not shown. The Paris sequence is very brief and does not include an establishing shot of the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   ***Gigi* (1958):** Another musical set in Paris. While it features many on-location scenes and establishing shots of Paris, it was released and won the Oscar several years after *An American in Paris*.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclude and Finalize the Answer**\n\nBy examining the list of Best Picture winners in chronological order, we can establish the following:\n*   No winner before 1951 clearly depicts either the Place de la Concorde in Paris or the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   The 1951 winner for Best Picture, *An American in Paris*, contains an unmistakable and artistically significant depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde during its famous final ballet.\n*   Later winners, like *Gigi*, also feature Paris, but *An American in Paris* is the first.\n\nTherefore, the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk is *An American in Paris*.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
