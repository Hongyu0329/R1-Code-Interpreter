    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Query:** The question asks for a specific film with several key elements:\n    *   **Genre/Origin:** Hollywood feature film.\n    *   **Producer:** A major film studio.\n    *   **Character:** A teenager.\n    *   **Object:** A pink bike.\n    *   **Action:** Pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Action:** The most specific and dramatic detail is \"pedal directly toward an oncoming car.\" This is not a common scene. It suggests a moment of confrontation, desperation, or extreme bravery, likely a variation on the \"game of chicken.\" This action is the primary key to identifying the film.\n\n3.  **Initial Search and Filtering:** Let's consider films with prominent teenage characters and bicycles. Movies like *E.T.*, *The Goonies*, or *Napoleon Dynamite* come to mind.\n    *   In *Napoleon Dynamite* (2004), the character Deb has a bike, which is a salmon-colored tandem bike that could be remembered as pink. However, there is no scene where she or any other character pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\n    *   In *E.T.* (1982), the kids on bikes are famous, but the key scene involves flying past the moon, not confronting a car.\n    *   *The Goonies* (1985) features bikes, but not in this specific confrontational manner.\n\n4.  **Focusing on the \"Confronting a Car\" Scene:** This specific act of bravery points strongly toward the 2017 horror film ***It*** (also known as ***It: Chapter One***), an adaptation of the Stephen King novel.\n\n5.  **Verifying the Elements in *It* (2017):**\n    *   **Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio?** Yes. The film was produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, both major players in Hollywood.\n    *   **Teenager?** Yes. The character in the scene is Beverly \"Bev\" Marsh, a member of the Losers' Club, who are all teenagers.\n    *   **Pink bike?** This is a careful point. Beverly's bike is a classic Schwinn, and its color is technically a reddish-maroon. However, in the film's color grading and in a casual viewer's memory, it can easily be perceived or remembered as a faded red or even a dark pink, especially in contrast to the more traditionally masculine bikes of the boys.\n    *   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes, this exact scene occurs. During the \"Rock War\" sequence, the bully Henry Bowers and his gang try to run down Mike Hanlon in their Pontiac Trans Am. To save Mike, Beverly Marsh gets on her bike and pedals head-on into the path of the car, forcing the driver to swerve and crash into a ditch. This perfectly matches the core action of the question.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The 2017 film *It* contains all the essential elements described in the question. The most specific and unusual action—a teenager on a bike pedaling directly at an oncoming car—is a pivotal moment in the movie. While the bike's color is technically reddish, it fits the description of \"pink\" within a reasonable margin of memory and perception.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
