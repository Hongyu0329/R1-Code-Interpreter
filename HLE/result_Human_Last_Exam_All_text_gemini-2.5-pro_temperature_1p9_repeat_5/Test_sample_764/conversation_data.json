    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Two Formulations:** The question presents two common formulations for the Lasso regression model.\n    *   **Formulation 1 (Constraint Form):**\n        (Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ) = argmin_{Œ±, Œ≤} ‚àë·µ¢(y·µ¢ ‚Äî Œ± ‚Äî ‚àë‚±ºŒ≤‚±ºx·µ¢‚±º)¬≤\n        subject to: ‚àë‚±º |ùõΩ‚±º| ‚â§ ùë°\n        This form minimizes the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) under the constraint that the L1-norm of the coefficient vector ùõΩ is less than or equal to a budget `t`.\n\n    *   **Formulation 2 (Lagrangian/Penalized Form):**\n        (Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ) = argmin_{Œ±, Œ≤} ‚àë·µ¢(y·µ¢ ‚Äî Œ± ‚Äî ‚àë‚±ºŒ≤‚±ºx·µ¢‚±º)¬≤ + Œª‚àë‚±º |ùõΩ‚±º|\n        This form minimizes a single objective function which is a combination of the RSS and a penalty term. The penalty is the L1-norm of the coefficients scaled by a tuning parameter Œª.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is whether these two formulations are equivalent. Specifically, it asks if for any solution `(Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ)` obtained from one formulation (for a specific `t` or `Œª`), there is always a corresponding value of the other parameter (`Œª` or `t`) that yields the exact same solution `(Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ)`. The phrase \"always strictly true\" implies we must look for any counterexamples or conditions under which the equivalence might fail or not be perfectly one-to-one.\n\n3.  **Connection via Convex Optimization Theory:**\n    *   Both formulations are convex optimization problems. The RSS is a convex function, and the L1-norm `‚àë‚±º |ùõΩ‚±º|` is also a convex function. The constraint set in the first form is convex, and the sum of convex functions in the second form is also convex.\n    *   In convex optimization, the Lagrangian formulation (like Formulation 2) is intimately related to the constrained formulation (like Formulation 1). Under general conditions (specifically, strong duality, which holds here because Slater's condition is met for t>0), the problems are equivalent. This means that for any solution to the constrained problem with a given `t`, there exists a corresponding Lagrange multiplier `Œª` such that this solution also solves the penalized problem, and vice versa.\n\n4.  **Investigating \"Strict\" Equivalence and Potential Issues:** The words \"always strictly\" suggest we need to be careful about edge cases.\n    *   **Issue 1: Non-unique mapping of tuning parameters.** The relationship between `t` and `Œª` is not necessarily a strict one-to-one mapping. The L1-norm of the solution, let's call it `S(Œª) = ‚àë‚±º |ùõΩÃÇ‚±º(Œª)|`, is a continuous, non-increasing function of `Œª`. It's possible for `S(Œª)` to be constant over an interval of `Œª` values (i.e., have \"flat spots\"). If we choose a value of `t` that falls within one of these flat regions, there will be an entire interval of `Œª` values that correspond to this `t`. This means the mapping from `t` to `Œª` is not always unique (not strictly one-to-one). However, the set of solutions remains equivalent.\n\n    *   **Issue 2: The case of non-unique OLS solutions.** This is a more profound issue. It occurs when the predictors are perfectly collinear or when the number of predictors `p` is greater than the number of observations `n`. In this scenario, the matrix X·µÄX is singular, and the ordinary least squares (OLS) problem (which corresponds to `Œª=0` or a very large `t`) does not have a unique solution. Instead, there is an entire affine subspace of solutions that all minimize the RSS.\n        *   Let S_OLS be this set of OLS solutions. The penalized Lasso problem with `Œª > 0` will act as a tie-breaker: among all solutions that nearly minimize RSS, it will pick the one with the smallest L1-norm `||Œ≤||‚ÇÅ`. The limit of the Lasso solution as `Œª ‚Üí 0‚Å∫` will be the specific solution in S_OLS that has the minimum L1-norm.\n        *   Now, consider a solution `Œ≤*` that is in S_OLS but does *not* have the minimum L1-norm. Let `t* = ||Œ≤*||‚ÇÅ`. This `Œ≤*` is a valid solution to the constrained problem (Formulation 1) for this value `t*`.\n        *   Is this `Œ≤*` a solution to the penalized problem (Formulation 2) for any `Œª`? For any `Œª > 0`, the solution is not `Œ≤*`. For `Œª = 0`, the set of solutions is the entire set S_OLS, which contains `Œ≤*` but is not uniquely `Œ≤*`. Therefore, we have found a solution to the constrained problem for which there is no `Œª > 0` that produces it as a solution, and for `Œª=0` it is one of many possible solutions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Equivalence:** Because of the issue described in point 4 (especially Issue 2), the equivalence is not \"always strictly true\". There exist solutions to the constrained problem that are not unique solutions to the penalized problem for any `Œª`. This breaks a strict, one-to-one equivalence between the solutions of the two problems.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**\n    *   The statement in the question is factually false due to the identified exceptions. We are looking for an answer that correctly reflects this.\n    *   Answers starting with \"True...\" (D, F, G, J) are incorrect because the statement is not always true.\n    *   Answers giving incorrect reasons (e.g., that the solution path is not continuous) are also incorrect (A, B, C, H, I). The Lasso solution path `Œ≤ÃÇ(Œª)` is well-known to be continuous in `Œª`.\n    *   This leaves us with options E and K.\n        *   **E. False in general, but often true in practice:** This correctly identifies the statement as false from a strict mathematical viewpoint. The qualifier \"often true in practice\" acknowledges that in many settings (e.g., p < n and no perfect collinearity), the OLS solution is unique and the equivalence holds well.\n        *   **K. True in general, but not always strictly true:** This option frames the situation differently. It suggests the underlying principle of equivalence (from duality theory) is \"true in general,\" but it fails to be \"strictly\" true due to the edge cases (like the non-uniqueness issues).\n\n    *   **Comparing E and K:** The choice between E and K depends on how one weighs the principle versus the exceptions. The question asks if it is \"always strictly true,\" which is a high bar that invites formal counterexamples. Since a significant and important class of problems (p > n, the main playground for Lasso) provides a counterexample, stating the claim is \"False in general\" (E) is very accurate. However, the framing in (K) is also very insightful. It acknowledges that the principle of equivalence from optimization theory is sound (\"True in general\"), but that its application isn't always straightforward (\"not always strictly true\"). The failure is a lack of \"strictness\" (e.g., non-unique mapping, or non-uniqueness of the solution itself at `Œª=0`). This subtle phrasing accurately captures the nuance of the situation. The equivalence as a concept holds, but the strict correspondence between solutions for specific parameter values can break. This makes K a very strong candidate. The failure is a subtle breakdown of strictness in the correspondence, not a complete failure of the general principle of duality.\n\n<<<K>>>"
