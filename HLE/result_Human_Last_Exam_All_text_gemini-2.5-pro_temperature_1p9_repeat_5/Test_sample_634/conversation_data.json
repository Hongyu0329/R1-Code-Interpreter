    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\n$P_1(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$P_2(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nA matrix G(s) is the GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) if:\n1. G(s) is a right divisor of both P1(s) and P2(s). (i.e., $P_1 = Q_1 G$ and $P_2 = Q_2 G$ for some polynomial matrices $Q_1, Q_2$).\n2. Any other common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) is also a right divisor of G(s).\n\n**Step 2: Set up the Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n\nThe standard method for finding the GCRD is to use a procedure analogous to the Euclidean algorithm. We form a composite matrix M(s) by stacking P1(s) and P2(s) vertically.\n\n$M(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nWe then use elementary row operations to reduce this matrix to the form $\\begin{bmatrix} G(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, where G(s) is the GCRD. The elementary row operations allowed are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\n**Step 3: Perform Row Reduction**\n\nLet's denote the rows of M(s) as R1, R2, R3, and R4.\n\n$R_1 = [s^2 + s, -s]$\n$R_2 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2]$\n$R_3 = [s, 0]$\n$R_4 = [-s - 1, 1]$\n\n**Careful Point:** A good strategy is to find a pivot element that simplifies the reduction process. The element in position (4,2) is a constant, 1. This is the best possible pivot. We will use this '1' to create zeros in the second column of the other rows.\n\n*   **Operation 1: Eliminate the second element of R1.**\n    We replace R1 with $R_1 + s \\cdot R_4$.\n    $R_1' = [s^2 + s, -s] + s \\cdot [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = [0, 0]$\n\n*   **Operation 2: Eliminate the second element of R2.**\n    We replace R2 with $R_2 - s^2 \\cdot R_4$.\n    $R_2' = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 \\cdot [-s - 1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 - (-s^3 - s^2), s^2 - s^2] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0] = [s^3 - 1, 0]$\n\nAfter these operations, the matrix M(s) is row-equivalent to:\n$M'(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ s^3 - 1 & 0 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe row space of M(s) is spanned by the non-zero rows of M'(s): $\\{ [s^3 - 1, 0], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1] \\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Continue the Reduction**\n\nLet's work with the set of non-zero rows. Let the new rows be:\n$R_a = [s^3 - 1, 0]$\n$R_b = [s, 0]$\n$R_c = [-s - 1, 1]$\n\n**Careful Point:** Notice that rows Ra and Rb both have a zero in the second column. We can perform row operations between them, which is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their first elements, $s^3-1$ and $s$.\n\n*   **Operation 3: Use the Euclidean algorithm on the first elements.**\n    For polynomials $s^3 - 1$ and $s$:\n    $s^3 - 1 = (s^2) \\cdot s - 1$\n    The remainder is -1. This means their GCD is 1 (or any non-zero constant).\n    We can achieve a row $[1, 0]$ by performing the corresponding row operation: $R_a - s^2 \\cdot R_b$.\n    $R_a' = [s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2 \\cdot [s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0]$\n    Multiplying by -1 (a valid row operation), we get $[1, 0]$.\n\nNow, our set of spanning rows can be replaced by $\\{[1, 0], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]\\}$. The row $[s, 0]$ is now redundant because it can be formed by $s \\cdot [1, 0]$. Thus, the row space is spanned by $\\{[1, 0], [-s - 1, 1]\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Reduction Step**\n\nOur task is to reduce the matrix formed by these two rows:\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**Careful Point:** We can use the '1' in the first row as a pivot to eliminate the first element of the second row.\n\n*   **Operation 4: Eliminate the first element of the second row.**\n    Let the rows be $R_x = [1, 0]$ and $R_y = [-s - 1, 1]$.\n    We replace $R_y$ with $R_y + (s+1) \\cdot R_x$.\n    $R_y' = [-s - 1, 1] + (s+1) \\cdot [1, 0] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 + 0] = [0, 1]$\n\nThe final set of non-zero rows that span the row space of the original matrix M(s) is $\\{[1, 0], [0, 1]\\}$. We can arrange these into a 2x2 matrix.\n\n**Step 6: State the Final Answer**\n\nThe reduction process shows that the composite matrix M(s) is row-equivalent to $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe non-zero part of this reduced matrix is the GCRD.\n\n$G(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThis is the identity matrix, which means the polynomial matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are right coprime.\n\n<<<$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$>>>"
