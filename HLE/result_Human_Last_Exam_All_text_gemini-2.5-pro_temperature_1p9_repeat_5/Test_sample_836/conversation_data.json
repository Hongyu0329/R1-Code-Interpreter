    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Function:** \"generalized pair correlation function\". This function describes the correlation between the presence of particles (in this case, neutrons) at two different points in space and time. Let's call it $G(\\vec{r}, t)$. It measures the probability of finding a neutron at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, given there was a neutron at the origin at $t=0$. In the nuclear criticality context, this correlation primarily arises from neutrons that share a common ancestor in a fission chain.\n    *   **Mathematical Operation:** \"space-time, double Fourier transform\". This is a standard mathematical operation that transforms a function from the space-time domain $(\\vec{r}, t)$ to the wavevector-frequency domain $(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$. The resulting function, let's call it $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$, is defined as:\n        $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega) = \\iint G(\\vec{r}, t) e^{-i(\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r} - \\omega t)} d^3r dt$\n    *   **Context:** \"commonly called in the nuclear criticality community\". This is the crucial constraint. We need to find the specific name used for $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ within this specialized field.\n\n2.  **Listing Careful Points & Exploring Terminology:**\n\n    *   **Point 1: Connection to Signal Processing.** The Wiener-Khinchin theorem in signal processing states that the Fourier transform of an autocorrelation function is the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**. This theorem can be generalized to spatiotemporal fields. Therefore, mathematically, $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ is the power spectral density of the neutron density fluctuations. In the nuclear noise literature, terms like Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD) and Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD) are extremely common for the time-only Fourier transform of detector signals. This makes \"Power Spectral Density\" a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Connection to Statistical Mechanics & Scattering Theory.** The term \"generalized pair correlation function\" was formally introduced by LÃ©on van Hove in his seminal 1954 paper on the theory of thermal neutron scattering. In that foundational work, the space-time double Fourier transform of $G(\\vec{r}, t)$ is defined and named the **Dynamic Structure Factor**, $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$. This name is standard in condensed matter physics, as it describes the *structure* (probed by the wavevector $\\vec{k}$, related to momentum transfer) and the *dynamics* (probed by the frequency $\\omega$, related to energy transfer) of the system being studied.\n\n    *   **Point 3: Reconciling the Contexts.** We have two potential names stemming from different but related fields: \"Power Spectral Density\" and \"Dynamic Structure Factor\".\n        *   The **physical analogy** is nearly perfect. In scattering, $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ describes the spectrum of spontaneous density fluctuations (e.g., phonons) in a material. In nuclear criticality, $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ describes the spectrum of spontaneous neutron density fluctuations driven by the random fission process. Both represent the intrinsic excitation spectra of their respective systems.\n        *   The **terminology in the literature** shows that while \"Power Spectral Density\" is more frequent in applied nuclear engineering texts, the fundamental name associated with the \"generalized pair correlation function\" from its origins is the \"Dynamic Structure Factor\". The question's specific use of this term points towards this more fundamental answer. It's the specific name for the transform of that specific function.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion:** While the quantity is a type of Power Spectral Density, the specific name for the double Fourier transform of the *Generalized Pair Correlation Function*, established in the physics literature where the function was first defined, is the Dynamic Structure Factor. This name is physically descriptive and directly corresponds to the functions named in the user's question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly known as the **Dynamic Structure Factor**.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
