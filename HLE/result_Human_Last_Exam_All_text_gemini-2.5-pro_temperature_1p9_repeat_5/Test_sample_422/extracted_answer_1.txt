1. **The Problem of Contradictory States**: The JTB definition requires knowledge to be a subset of belief (i.e., to know something, you must also believe it). However, the premise establishes Knowledge and Belief as two mutually exclusive epistemic states. This creates a logical contradiction where it's impossible to satisfy the JTB definition, as having Knowledge would simultaneously require and forbid having Belief.
2. **The Problem of Circularity in Justification**: The "Justification" condition within the JTB model is problematic. Strong justification for a belief P often relies on the agent already possessing knowledge of other supporting propositions (Q, R, etc.). This means knowledge is being defined in terms of itself (`Knowledge(P)` requires `Knowledge(Q)`), leading to a circular definition or an infinite regress of justification.
