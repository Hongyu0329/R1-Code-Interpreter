    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nFirst, let's break down the core components and constraints of the problem.\n*   **Definition of Knowledge**: We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition, which states that for an agent S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true (T).\n    2.  S believes P (B).\n    3.  S is justified in believing P (J).\n*   **Constraint 1: Epistemic States**: The only available epistemic states for an agent are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This is a crucial simplification. It implies these two states are the only options, and likely mutually exclusive. If an agent considers a proposition, they are either in the state of 'knowing it' or 'believing it'.\n*   **Constraint 2: No Gettier Problems**: We must ignore the famous Gettier problems, which demonstrate that it's possible to have a justified true belief that doesn't intuitively count as knowledge (usually due to luck). Our problems must come from the interaction between the JTB definition and the simplified epistemic states.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points to Consider\n*   The JTB definition implies that **Knowledge is a subset of Belief**. To know something, you *must* believe it. This means `Knows(P) → Believes(P)`.\n*   The constraint of having only two epistemic states (Knowledge and Belief) suggests they are **mutually exclusive alternatives**. If you are in the state of Knowledge, you are not in the state of Belief, and vice-versa.\n*   The \"Justification\" condition is the most complex part of the JTB theory. We need to analyze what justification entails. Typically, a justification for one belief is built upon other beliefs or knowledge.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nBased on the points above, we can identify two major problems that arise in this specific scenario.\n\n**Problem 1: The Problem of Contradictory States**\n\nThis problem arises from a direct conflict between a core tenet of the JTB definition and the premise of the available epistemic states.\n\n1.  **From the JTB Definition**: Knowledge requires Belief. `K → B`. If an agent knows a proposition P, they must necessarily also believe P. So, if the agent is in the state of \"Knowledge\", they must also satisfy the condition of \"Belief\".\n2.  **From the Problem's Premise**: \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are the only two available states. This structure presents them as distinct, mutually exclusive categories. An agent is either in the state of Knowing P or in the state of Believing P. One cannot be in both simultaneously. Let's denote this as `¬(K and B)`.\n3.  **The Contradiction**: The two points above are logically incompatible. The JTB theory says that being in state K necessitates being in state B. The problem's premise says that being in state K prevents you from being in state B. Therefore, under the given premise, it is logically impossible to ever satisfy the JTB definition of knowledge. The framework contradicts itself.\n\n**Problem 2: The Problem of Circularity in Justification**\n\nThis problem arises when we analyze the \"Justification\" condition (J) within the JTB framework.\n\n1.  **What is Justification?**: To be justified in believing a proposition P, an agent usually needs supporting reasons, evidence, or a valid argument. For this justification to be strong enough for knowledge, the supporting reasons must themselves be very solid.\n2.  **Justification Relies on Knowledge**: In many strong theories of justification, the premises used to justify a new belief P must be things the agent *already knows*. For example, to justify my belief that \"My friend is at the library,\" I might rely on my knowledge that \"My friend sent me a text message saying 'I am at the library'\" and my knowledge that \"My friend is generally truthful.\"\n3.  **The Circularity**: If justification for a belief P requires prior knowledge of other propositions (Q, R, ...), then the definition of knowledge becomes circular. The definition is: `Knowledge(P) = Belief(P) + True(P) + Justification(P)`. But if `Justification(P)` depends on `Knowledge(Q)`, then we are defining knowledge in terms of knowledge. This leads to a vicious circle or an infinite regress (where the justification for Q needs knowledge of R, and so on forever), meaning no belief could ever be fundamentally justified.\n\n<<<1. **The Problem of Contradictory States**: The JTB definition requires knowledge to be a subset of belief (i.e., to know something, you must also believe it). However, the premise establishes Knowledge and Belief as two mutually exclusive epistemic states. This creates a logical contradiction where it's impossible to satisfy the JTB definition, as having Knowledge would simultaneously require and forbid having Belief.\n2. **The Problem of Circularity in Justification**: The \"Justification\" condition within the JTB model is problematic. Strong justification for a belief P often relies on the agent already possessing knowledge of other supporting propositions (Q, R, etc.). This means knowledge is being defined in terms of itself (`Knowledge(P)` requires `Knowledge(Q)`), leading to a circular definition or an infinite regress of justification.>>>"
