    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the set of lines**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line `L` with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (i.e., `gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet's list a few of these lines:\n*   If `(p, q) = (1, 0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (-1, 0)`, the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (0, 1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (0, -1)`, the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (1, 1)`, the line is `x + y = 1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (1, -1)`, the line is `x - y = 1`.\n*   And so on for all pairs of coprime integers.\n\nThe convex domain `K` must have a non-empty intersection with all these lines.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the area**\n\nA necessary condition for `K` is that it must intersect the subset of lines where `p` and `q` are the simplest. Let's consider the four lines:\n1.  `x = 1` (from `p=1, q=0`)\n2.  `x = -1` (from `p=-1, q=0`)\n3.  `y = 1` (from `p=0, q=1`)\n4.  `y = -1` (from `p=0, q=-1`)\n\nAny convex set `K` that intersects these four lines must have a certain minimum area.\n*   To intersect `x=1`, `K` must have at least one point `(x, y)` where `x >= 1`. So, `sup_{ (x,y) \\in K } (x) >= 1`.\n*   To intersect `x=-1`, `K` must have at least one point `(x, y)` where `x <= -1`. So, `inf_{ (x,y) \\in K } (x) <= -1`.\n*   The width of `K` in the x-direction, `w_x = sup(x) - inf(x)`, must therefore be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n*   Similarly, to intersect `y=1` and `y=-1`, the width of `K` in the y-direction, `w_y`, must be at least 2.\n\nA classic result in geometry states that the minimum area of a convex set that intersects the four lines `x = ±c` and `y = ±c` is `2c^2`. In our case, `c=1`, so the minimal area of a convex set intersecting these four lines is `2 * 1^2 = 2`.\n\nThis establishes a lower bound for our problem. The minimal area of `K` must be at least 2. `Area(K) >= 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Propose a candidate domain and verify if it works**\n\nThe shape that achieves the minimum area `2` for intersecting the four lines `x=±1, y=±1` is the diamond-shaped region defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| <= 1`.\nLet's call this domain `D`.\nThe vertices of `D` are `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)`.\nThe area of this domain is `(1/2) * (diagonal 1) * (diagonal 2) = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\nNow, we need to verify if this domain `D` intersects *every* line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, not just the four we used to set the lower bound.\n\nA convex domain `K` intersects a line `ax + by = c` if and only if the values of the function `f(x, y) = ax + by` on `K` span across `c`. That is, `inf_{K} f(x, y) <= c <= sup_{K} f(x, y)`.\nFor our line `px + qy = 1`, this means `inf_{D} (px+qy) <= 1 <= sup_{D} (px+qy)`.\nSince our domain `D` is symmetric with respect to the origin, this is equivalent to checking if `sup_{D} |px + qy| >= 1`.\n\nThe function `f(x, y) = px + qy` is linear. On a convex polygon like our diamond `D`, its maximum and minimum values must occur at the vertices.\nThe vertices of `D` are `(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)`.\nLet's evaluate `px + qy` at these vertices:\n*   At `(1, 0)`: `p*1 + q*0 = p`\n*   At `(-1, 0)`: `p*(-1) + q*0 = -p`\n*   At `(0, 1)`: `p*0 + q*1 = q`\n*   At `(0, -1)`: `p*0 + q*(-1) = -q`\n\nThe set of values is `{p, -p, q, -q}`.\nThe maximum absolute value is `max(|p|, |-p|, |q|, |-q|) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nSo, `sup_{D} |px + qy| = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\nThe condition for `D` to intersect all lines is `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1` for all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`.\n*   `p` and `q` are integers.\n*   \"Coprime\" implies that they are not both zero.\n*   If `p` and `q` are integers and are not both zero, then at least one of them must be a non-zero integer.\n*   The absolute value of any non-zero integer is at least 1.\n*   Therefore, `|p| >= 1` or `|q| >= 1`, which means `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\n\nThe condition holds true. The domain `D = {(x, y) | |x| + |y| <= 1}` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the final answer**\n\n1.  We established a lower bound for the area: any such convex domain must have an area of at least 2.\n2.  We found a specific convex domain, the diamond `|x| + |y| <= 1`, that satisfies all the required intersection properties.\n3.  The area of this domain is exactly 2.\n\nSince the area of our candidate domain matches the lower bound, it must be the minimal possible area."
