    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the Church integer `n` and then `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Combinators and Church Numerals\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions of the SKI combinators and Church numerals.\n\n*   **Combinator Rules:**\n    *   `S f g x = f x (g x)`\n    *   `K x y = x`\n    *   `I x = x`\n\n*   **Church Numerals:** A Church numeral `c` is a higher-order function that represents a natural number. Its definition is given by its behavior when applied to a function `f` and an argument `x`:\n    `c f x = f(f(...(f x)...))` (where `f` is applied `c` times).\n    For example:\n    *   `1 f x = f x`\n    *   `2 f x = f (f x)`\n    *   `3 f x = f (f (f x))`\n\n### Step 2: Parsing the Expression\n\nThe expression is given as `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))))(B)`, where the terms `A` and `B` are themselves complex expressions. SKI expressions are left-associative, so `X Y Z` means `(X Y) Z`.\n\nLet the entire expression be `E`. We can parse it as:\n`E = ( (S I) Y ) Z`\nwhere:\n*   `Y = S(I) (S(I) (K(A)))`\n*   `Z = B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n*   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n\nUsing the rule for `S`, we can reduce the top level of `E`:\n`E = (S I Y) Z = I Z (Y Z) = Z (Y Z)`\n\nNow we need to evaluate `Y Z`:\n`Y Z = (S I (S I (K A))) Z`\nApplying the same logic:\n`Y Z = I Z ( (S I (K A)) Z ) = Z ( (S I (K A)) Z )`\nLet's evaluate the inner part `(S I (K A)) Z`:\n`(S I (K A)) Z = I Z ( (K A) Z ) = Z (K A Z)`\nUsing the `K` rule, `K A Z = A`. So the expression becomes `Z(A)`.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n`Y Z = Z(Z(A))`\nFinally, substituting this into the expression for `E`:\n`E = Z (Y Z) = Z(Z(Z(A)))`\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` is equivalent to `Z(Z(Z(A)))`, where `Z` and `A` are themselves Church numerals derived from the sub-expressions.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Sub-expressions `A` and `Z`\n\nLet's define the recurring combinator `M = S(S(K(S))(K))`. In SKI logic, `K(S)` is equivalent to `K S` because both are functions that take an argument and return the `S` combinator. The combinator `B` is defined as `S(K S)K`. Thus, `M` can be written as `S(B)`.\n\nNow, let's determine what the operator `M` does. It acts as the successor function (`SUCC`) for Church numerals. Let's prove this by applying `M` to a numeral `c`:\n`M c f x = (S(B) c) f x = B f (c f) x = f ( (c f) x )`\nSince `c f x` applies `f` for `c` times, `f((c f)x)` will apply `f` for `c+1` times. Therefore, `M` is the successor function: `M(c) = c+1`.\n\nNow we can evaluate `A` and `Z`.\n\n*   **Evaluate `A`**:\n    `A = M(I) = SUCC(I)`\n    The combinator `I` acts as the Church numeral `1`, because `I f x = f x`, which is the definition of `1`.\n    Therefore, `A = SUCC(1) = 2`.\n\n*   **Evaluate `Z`**:\n    `Z = B = M(N)` where `N = S(I)(I)`.\n    Let's find the numerical value of `N` by seeing how it behaves:\n    `N f x = S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (I f x) = f(f x)`.\n    This is the definition of the Church numeral `2`. So, `N=2`.\n    Now we can evaluate `Z`:\n    `Z = M(N) = SUCC(2) = 3`.\n\nWe have determined that `A` is the Church numeral `2` and `Z` is the Church numeral `3`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation of n\n\nThe expression for `n` is `Z(Z(Z(A)))`. For Church numerals, applying one numeral `m` to another numeral `c`, written `m(c)`, is equivalent to multiplication `m * c`.\nLet's verify this: `(m c) f = m (c f)`. Since `c f` represents applying a function `f` for `c` times, `m (c f)` means taking the operation `c f` and applying it `m` times. This results in `m * c` total applications of `f`.\n\nSo we can calculate `n` as follows:\n`n = 3(3(3(2))) = 3 * (3 * (3 * 2))`\n`n = 3 * (3 * 6)`\n`n = 3 * 18`\n`n = 54`\n\nThe Church integer represented by the expression is `54`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate `log_2(n)`\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(54) = log_2(2 * 27) = log_2(2) + log_2(27) = 1 + log_2(3^3) = 1 + 3 * log_2(3)`\nUsing a calculator, `log_2(3) ≈ 1.58496`.\n`log_2(54) ≈ 1 + 3 * 1.58496 = 1 + 4.75488 = 5.75488`\n\nThe final answer is approximately 5.755.\n\n<<<5.754887502163469>>>"
