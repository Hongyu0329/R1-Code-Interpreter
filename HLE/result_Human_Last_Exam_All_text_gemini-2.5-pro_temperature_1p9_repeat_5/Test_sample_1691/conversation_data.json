    "An analysis of the integral for the small $\\epsilon$ regime is performed step by step below.\n\n**1. Analyze the integral and the integrand**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + f(x)$, where $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$.\nWe are interested in the behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$ for small positive $\\epsilon$ ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\nWe must first identify any points in the integration interval $[0, 15.00]$ where the denominator might become small.\nThe function $f(x)$ has all positive coefficients and positive powers of $x$.\nFor $x > 0$, $f(x) > 0$.\nAt $x = 0$, $f(0) = 0$.\nTherefore, the denominator $\\epsilon + f(x)$ becomes close to zero only when $x$ is close to 0. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand develops a singularity at $x=0$. This means the dominant contribution to the integral for small $\\epsilon$ will come from the region near $x=0$.\n\n**2. Approximate the integrand for small x**\n\nNear $x=0$, the function $f(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$, as higher powers of $x$ become negligible much faster.\n$f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0} \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$ for $x \\to 0$.\n\nSo, we can approximate the integral as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n**3. Approximate the integral value**\n\nThe main contribution to this integral comes from the region where $\\epsilon$ and $9.0 x^{5.0}$ are of comparable magnitude. This occurs for very small $x$. For larger $x$ within the interval, the term $9.0 x^{5.0}$ becomes large, making the integrand very small. Consequently, the contribution from the upper part of the integration range is negligible compared to the part near the singularity. This allows us to extend the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ to obtain a standard integral form without significantly affecting the result for small $\\epsilon$.\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n**4. Evaluate the approximated integral**\n\nTo solve this integral, we perform a series of substitutions. Let $\\alpha = 9.0$ and $a = 5.0$.\nThe integral is $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\alpha x^a} dx$.\n\nFirst substitution: let $u = \\alpha x^a$.\nThis implies $x = \\left(\\frac{u}{\\alpha}\\right)^{1/a}$, and the differential is $dx = \\frac{1}{\\alpha^{1/a}} \\frac{1}{a} u^{\\frac{1}{a}-1} du$.\nThe limits of integration remain $0$ to $\\infty$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + u} \\left( \\frac{1}{a \\alpha^{1/a}} u^{\\frac{1}{a}-1} \\right) du = \\frac{1}{a \\alpha^{1/a}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{\\frac{1}{a}-1}}{\\epsilon + u} du$\n\nSecond substitution: let $u = \\epsilon t$.\nThis implies $du = \\epsilon dt$. The limits of integration remain $0$ to $\\infty$.\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{a \\alpha^{1/a}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon t)^{\\frac{1}{a}-1}}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon t} (\\epsilon dt)$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{a \\alpha^{1/a}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon^{\\frac{1}{a}-1} t^{\\frac{1}{a}-1}}{\\epsilon(1 + t)} \\epsilon dt$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{\\frac{1}{a}-1}}{a \\alpha^{1/a}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{\\frac{1}{a}-1}}{1 + t} dt$\n\n**5. Use the Beta function identity**\n\nThe resulting integral is a standard form related to the Euler's Beta function:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{z-1}}{1 + t} dt = \\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$\n\nIn our case, the exponent of $t$ is $\\frac{1}{a}-1$. So, we have $z-1 = \\frac{1}{a}-1$, which means $z = \\frac{1}{a}$.\nThe value of the integral is $\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/a)}$.\n\n**6. Final Analytical Formula**\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{\\frac{1}{a}-1}}{a \\alpha^{1/a}} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/a)}$\n\nNow, we plug in the specific values from the problem: $a = 5.0$ and $\\alpha = 9.0$.\nThe exponent of $\\epsilon$ is $\\frac{1}{5.0} - 1 = 0.2 - 1 = -0.8 = -4/5$.\nThe coefficient is $\\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$.\n\nSo, the analytical formula approximating $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$ is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}>>>"
