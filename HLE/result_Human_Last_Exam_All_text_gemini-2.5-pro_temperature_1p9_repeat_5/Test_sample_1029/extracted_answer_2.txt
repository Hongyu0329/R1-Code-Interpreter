The Poynting vector $\vec{S}$ depends on the radial distance $r$ from the axis of the cylinder and is given by a piecewise function:

For inside the rod ($r \le R$):
$$ \vec{S}(r) = \frac{\rho^2 v r^2}{4\epsilon_0} \hat{z} - \frac{E \rho v r}{2} \hat{r} $$

For outside the rod ($r > R$):
$$ \vec{S}(r) = \frac{\rho^2 v R^4}{4\epsilon_0 r^2} \hat{z} - \frac{E \rho v R^2}{2r} \hat{r} $$
where $\hat{z}$ is the unit vector along the axis in the direction of motion, and $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing radially outward from the axis.
