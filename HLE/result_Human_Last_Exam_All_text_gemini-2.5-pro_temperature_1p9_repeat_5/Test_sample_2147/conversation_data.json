    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Figure and Context**\nThe question centers on Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian liberal politician and historian active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is described as criticizing Western culture and denouncing \"X-Ys\". This sets the time period and the subject matter as cultural criticism.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Metaphor**\nThe phrase \"stagnant swamp\" is a powerful metaphor. A swamp is stagnant, unproductive, decaying, and potentially miasmic or poisonous. In a cultural context, this suggests Milyukov viewed \"X-Ys\" as a movement or group that was:\n*   Lacking vitality and forward progress.\n*   Self-indulgent and inward-looking, rather than contributing to society.\n*   A sign of cultural decay or degeneration.\n*   Potentially morally corrupt or unhealthy.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Milyukov's Known Positions**\nWhile Milyukov was a \"Westernizer\" and a liberal who believed Russia should follow a Western path of political development, he was also a rationalist and a positivist. He believed in progress, reason, and social utility. This put him at odds with the newer artistic and philosophical movements of his time, which are often grouped under the umbrella of Modernism. He was a staunch critic of what he saw as the pessimism, mysticism, aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), and irrationalism of these new trends.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Target of Criticism**\nMilyukov's critiques were famously aimed at the cultural movements of the Russian \"Silver Age\" (roughly 1890s-1917), which were heavily influenced by contemporary trends in Western Europe, particularly France. The two most prominent and interconnected of these movements were:\n*   **Symbolism:** An artistic and literary movement that rejected realism in favor of spirituality, imagination, and dreams. It used symbols to suggest ideas and emotions rather than depicting objective reality.\n*   **Decadence:** A related movement characterized by a mood of ennui, pessimism, and a fascination with the perverse, artificial, and exotic. It celebrated aestheticism over morality and social engagement.\n\nThese two movements were often conflated, and their proponents were frequently referred to jointly.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identity of \"X-Y\"**\nGiven Milyukov's positivist worldview and his sharp criticism of modern art and literature, the target of his \"stagnant swamp\" accusation was the group of artists and writers associated with these movements. The compound term that fits the \"X-Y\" structure and accurately describes this group is **symbolist-decadents**. This term precisely captures the specific faction of Western and Western-influenced culture that Milyukov saw as a regressive and unhealthy force.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Distinguishing Milyukov's Political vs. Cultural Views:** It is crucial not to assume his political liberalism automatically translated to cultural liberalism. His belief in a rational, progressive society made him culturally conservative in his reaction to modernist movements that he perceived as irrational and nihilistic.\n2.  **The Specificity of the \"X-Y\" format:** The question uses \"X-Y\", suggesting a two-part or hyphenated term. \"Symbolist-decadents\" fits this structure perfectly, as the two movements were closely linked and often discussed as a single phenomenon.\n3.  **Historical Context:** The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a major cultural clash between the established 19th-century traditions of Realism and Positivism and the rise of Modernism. Milyukov was a firm voice for the former tradition against the latter.\n4.  **Accuracy of the Metaphor:** The \"stagnant swamp\" metaphor aligns perfectly with a rationalist's view of movements centered on mysticism, aestheticism, and subjectivism. To a pragmatist like Milyukov, such art would seem to have no connection to real-world progress and social betterment, making it \"stagnant\".\n\n***\n\n<<<symbolist-decadents>>>"
