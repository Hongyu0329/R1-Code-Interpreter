    "Answering this question requires determining the structure of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space and the object of interest.**\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr(3, 5)$. This manifold is diffeomorphic to $Gr(2, 5)$, the space of 2-planes in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, which is often easier to work with. Let $X = Gr(2, 5)$. The dimension of this space is $d = k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\n\nWe are asked for the \"rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\" $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. The integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian is known to only have 2-torsion. Thus, the torsion subgroup of $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is of the form $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^m$ for some integer $m$. A torsion group has rank 0 as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module. The term \"rank\" in this context is interpreted as the number of cyclic summands, which is $m$. This is also the dimension of the torsion subgroup considered as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Our goal is to find this number $m$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate integral cohomology to mod-2 cohomology.**\nLet $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus T_i$, where $b_i$ is the $i$-th Betti number and $T_i$ is the torsion subgroup of $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. Since all torsion is 2-torsion, $T_i \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_i}$ for some integer $t_i \\ge 0$. The value we are looking for is $m = \\sum_{i=0}^6 t_i$.\n\nThe Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology provides a relationship between integral and mod-2 cohomology. For any space $X$ with only 2-torsion, the dimensions are related by the following formula for each degree $i$:\n$\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = b_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$.\nLet's denote $d_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the dimensions of the mod-2 cohomology groups ($d_i$).**\nThe mod-2 cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(k,n); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is well-known. Its dimension in degree $i$, $d_i$, is equal to the number of Schubert cells of dimension $i$. For $Gr(k,n)$, the Schubert cells are indexed by partitions $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$. The codimension of the cell corresponding to $\\lambda$ is $|\\lambda|=\\sum \\lambda_j$.\nFor $X=Gr(2,5)$, we have $k=2, n=5$, so we consider partitions $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ with $3 \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge 0$.\nThe dimension of the cohomology group $H^i$ corresponds to cells of codimension $i$.\n- $d_0$: $i=0$. $\\lambda=(0,0)$. One partition. $d_0=1$.\n- $d_1$: $i=1$. $\\lambda=(1,0)$. One partition. $d_1=1$.\n- $d_2$: $i=2$. $\\lambda=(2,0), (1,1)$. Two partitions. $d_2=2$.\n- $d_3$: $i=3$. $\\lambda=(3,0), (2,1)$. Two partitions. $d_3=2$.\n- $d_4$: $i=4$. $\\lambda=(3,1), (2,2)$. Two partitions. $d_4=2$.\n- $d_5$: $i=5$. $\\lambda=(3,2)$. One partition. $d_5=1$.\n- $d_6$: $i=6$. $\\lambda=(3,3)$. One partition. $d_6=1$.\nSo, the sequence of dimensions of mod-2 cohomology groups is $(d_0, d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6) = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Use known properties of the cohomology of Grassmannians to find $b_i$ and $t_i$.**\nWe now have a system of equations $d_i=b_i+t_i+t_{i+1}$, but we need more information about the Betti numbers $b_i$ and torsion coefficients $t_i$.\n\n1.  For any connected space, $H^0(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus $b_0=1$ and $t_0=0$.\n    Using the formula for $i=0$: $d_0=b_0+t_0+t_1 \\Rightarrow 1=1+0+t_1 \\Rightarrow t_1=0$.\n2.  The Grassmannian $Gr(k,n)$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is even. Since $n=5$ is odd, $Gr(2,5)$ is a non-orientable 6-manifold. For a compact, non-orientable $d$-manifold, the top Betti number $b_d$ is 0. So, $b_6=0$.\n    Using the formula for $i=6$: $d_6 = b_6+t_6+t_7$. As the manifold is 6-dimensional, $H^7=0$, so $t_7=0$.\n    The equation becomes $1 = 0 + t_6 + 0$, which gives $t_6=1$.\n3.  The Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ can be computed using any field coefficients. Thus $\\sum(-1)^i b_i = \\sum(-1)^i d_i$.\n    $\\chi(X) = 1 - 1 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$. So, $\\sum(-1)^i b_i = 2$.\n4.  For real Grassmannians, the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1$ of the tautological bundle is non-zero, and its Bockstein $\\beta(w_1) \\in H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is a non-zero torsion element. This implies that $t_2 \\ge 1$.\n    Using the formula for $i=1$: $d_1 = b_1+t_1+t_2 \\Rightarrow 1=b_1+0+t_2$. Since $b_1 \\ge 0$ and $t_2 \\ge 1$, the only solution is $b_1=0$ and $t_2=1$.\n5.  For any manifold (orientable or not), Poincar√© duality implies $b_i = b_{d-i}$.\n    So, $b_5 = b_{6-5}=b_1=0$.\n    Using the formula for $i=5$: $d_5 = b_5+t_5+t_6 \\Rightarrow 1=0+t_5+1 \\Rightarrow t_5=0$.\n6.  The result $H^3(Gr(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ is known from literature (e.g., M. Mimura's work). This implies $b_3=1$ and $t_3=0$.\n\n**Step 5: Solve the remaining system of equations.**\nLet's collect what we know:\n- $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=1, b_5=0, b_6=0$.\n- $t_0=0, t_1=0, t_2=1, t_3=0, t_5=0, t_6=1$.\nWe need to find $b_2, b_4$ and $t_4$.\n\nThe remaining equations are:\n- $d_2=2: b_2+t_2+t_3 = b_2+1+0=2 \\Rightarrow b_2=1$.\n- $d_4=2: b_4+t_4+t_5 = b_4+t_4+0=2 \\Rightarrow b_4+t_4=2$.\n- The Euler characteristic constraint: $\\sum(-1)^i b_i = b_0-b_1+b_2-b_3+b_4-b_5+b_6 = 1-0+1-1+b_4-0+0=1+b_4 = 2 \\Rightarrow b_4=1$.\n\nSubstituting $b_4=1$ into $b_4+t_4=2$, we get $1+t_4=2 \\Rightarrow t_4=1$.\nWe have now found all the Betti numbers and torsion coefficients:\n- Betti numbers: $b=(1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0)$.\n- Torsion coefficients: $t=(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)$.\n\nLet's check for consistency with the unused equation for $d_3=2$:\n$b_3+t_3+t_4 = 1+0+1 = 2$. This matches, so our solution is consistent.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the final answer.**\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is $T = \\bigoplus_i T_i$.\nBased on our findings for $t_i$:\n$T(H^0) = 0$\n$T(H^1) = 0$\n$T(H^2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ ($t_2=1$)\n$T(H^3) = 0$\n$T(H^4) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ ($t_4=1$)\n$T(H^5) = 0$\n$T(H^6) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ ($t_6=1$)\nThe total torsion subgroup is $T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$.\nThe rank of this subgroup, interpreted as its number of generators (or its dimension over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$), is the sum of the exponents:\nRank = $t_0+t_1+t_2+t_3+t_4+t_5+t_6 = 0+0+1+0+1+0+1 = 3$."
