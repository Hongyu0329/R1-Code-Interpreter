**a) The equation for non-interacting molecules is:**

$\sigma_a(\omega_L) = N \frac{2\sqrt{\pi} \tau \omega_0}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} |\vec{\epsilon} \cdot \vec{\mu}_0|^2 e^{-(\omega_0 - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2}$

where:
*   $N$ is the number of molecules in the chain.
*   $\tau$ is the Gaussian pulse duration and $\omega_L$ is the laser's central frequency.
*   $\omega_0$ is the transition frequency of a single, isolated molecule.
*   $\vec{\mu}_0$ is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
*   $\vec{\epsilon}$ is the laser polarization vector.
*   $\hbar, c, \epsilon_0$ are fundamental constants.
This represents a single absorption peak whose intensity is N times that of a single molecule.

**b) The equation for molecules with near-neighbor interactions is:**

$\sigma_b(\omega_L) = \frac{2\sqrt{\pi} \tau}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \sum_{K=1}^{N} \omega_K |\vec{\epsilon} \cdot \vec{\mu}_{G \to K}|^2 e^{-(\omega_K - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2}$

where:
*   The sum is over the $N$ delocalized exciton states, labeled by index $K$.
*   $\omega_K$ is the transition frequency to the K-th exciton state. These frequencies form an exciton band, splitting the single peak from case (a).
*   $\vec{\mu}_{G \to K} = \sum_{n=1}^N c_{Kn}^* \vec{\mu}_0^{(n)}$ is the transition dipole moment to the K-th exciton state, which is a coherent sum of individual molecular dipoles ($\vec{\mu}_0^{(n)}$) weighted by the exciton wavefunction coefficients $c_{Kn}$.
This represents a spectrum of multiple absorption peaks, wi
