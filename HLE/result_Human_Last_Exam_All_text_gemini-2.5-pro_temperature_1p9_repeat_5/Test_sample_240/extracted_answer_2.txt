The observation is possible because many functional MRI coils are designed in ways that intentionally prevent or minimize coupling to a simple, external magnetic probe. The most likely reasons include the coil having a gradiometer/differential design that rejects uniform fields, being in a default "detuned" safety state that requires a specific scanner signal to become resonant, or having its resonance heavily damped by its integrated low-impedance preamplifier, making the signal too weak to detect with this method. Hidden RF shielding or incorrect probe orientation are also possible causes.
