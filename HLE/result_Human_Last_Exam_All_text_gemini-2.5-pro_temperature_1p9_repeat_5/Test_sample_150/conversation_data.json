    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\n1.  **Variable:** There is a single integer variable, `x`, initialized to 0.\n2.  **Operations:**\n    *   `++`: Increments `x` by 1.\n    *   `--`: Decrements `x` by 1.\n3.  **Statements:** A statement is a combination of one operation and the variable 'X'. The order can vary. This gives four possible valid statements:\n    *   `++X` (Prefix increment)\n    *   `X++` (Postfix increment)\n    *   `--X` (Prefix decrement)\n    *   `X--` (Postfix decrement)\n4.  **Program:** A program consists of `n` statements. The goal is to execute all `n` statements and output the final value of `x`.\n5.  **Input:** An integer `n` on the first line, followed by `n` lines, each containing one of the four valid statements.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Submitted Java Program\n1.  **Initialization:** The program correctly initializes a counter variable `tresult` to 0. This variable serves as `x`.\n2.  **Looping:** It reads the number of statements `t` and uses a `while (t-- > 0)` loop, which correctly iterates `t` times.\n3.  **Statement Processing:** Inside the loop, it reads each statement as a `String` called `test`.\n4.  **Logic Flaw:** The core logic lies in these two `if` conditions:\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))`\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))`\n    *   This logic only checks for the prefix versions of the operations (`++X` and `--X`). It completely fails to handle the postfix versions (`X++` and `X--`).\n5.  **Conclusion on Correctness:** The program is **incorrect**. For an input like `X++`, it will not increment `tresult`, leading to a wrong final answer.\n\n### Step 3: Develop an Efficient C Solution\nSince the program is incorrect, we must rewrite it. The goal is maximum efficiency (speed and memory) for an input of 100 instructions.\n\n**Careful Points for Efficiency:**\n1.  **Input Reading:** `scanf` is generally faster than `cin` in C++ or character-by-character reading with `getchar` for this type of structured input. Reading the whole string `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` is a good choice.\n2.  **Logic:** We don't need to parse the entire string or use expensive string comparison functions. A key observation is that all four statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`) have the operation's character (`+` or `-`) at the middle position (index 1).\n    *   `++X` -> `s[1]` is `+`\n    *   `X++` -> `s[1]` is `+`\n    *   `--X` -> `s[1]` is `-`\n    *   `X--` -> `s[1]` is `-`\n    Therefore, we only need to read the statement and check the character at index 1 to decide whether to increment or decrement. This avoids checking for all four string patterns and is very fast.\n3.  **Memory:** To minimize memory, we should declare only the essential variables. We need an integer for `n`, an integer for `x`, and a buffer for reading the input string. The strings are 3 characters long, so a `char` buffer of size 4 (for the null terminator `\\0`) is sufficient.\n4.  **An Even More Memory-Efficient Approach:** We can use a trick with `scanf` to avoid storing the whole string. The format string `scanf(\" %*c%c\", ...)` does the following:\n    *   The leading space ` ` skips any whitespace, including the newline left from the previous `scanf`.\n    *   `%*c` reads and *discards* one character (the first character of the statement).\n    *   `%c` reads the next character (the middle one, which is `+` or `-`) into a variable.\n    This approach only requires a single `char` variable instead of a 4-byte `char` array, saving 3 bytes.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Efficiency Metrics for the Optimal C Solution\nLet's analyze the most efficient C program based on the logic from Step 3, assuming `n = 100`.\n\n**Optimal C Code Idea:**\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int n, x = 0;\n    char op;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    while (n--) {\n        // Read just the middle character, which is always the operator\n        scanf(\" %*c%c\", &op); // \" %*c\" skips whitespace then the first char. \"%c\" reads the second char.\n        if (op == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            x--;\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n1.  **x = Smallest number of character comparisons (for n=100):**\n    *   Inside the loop, the code executes `if (op == '+')`. This is exactly **one** character comparison per statement.\n    *   For 100 statements, the total number of comparisons is 100 * 1 = **100**.\n    *   This is the theoretical minimum, as each statement must be inspected at least once to determine its type.\n    *   So, `x = 100`.\n\n2.  **y = Smallest memory size in Bytes (B):**\n    *   `int n;`: 4 bytes (assuming a standard 32-bit integer).\n    *   `int x;`: 4 bytes.\n    *   `char op;`: 1 byte.\n    *   Total memory for local variables = 4 + 4 + 1 = **9 bytes**.\n    *   This is the minimal amount of stack memory required to solve the problem with this method. We cannot eliminate `n` (or a loop counter), `x` (the result), or the single byte needed to process the input.\n    *   So, `y = 9`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Formulation\n*   **Is the program correct?** No.\n*   **What are x and y?** `x = 100` and `y = 9`.\n*   **Format:** `Nx+y`\n\nThe final answer is **N100+9**.\n\n<<<N100+9>>>"
