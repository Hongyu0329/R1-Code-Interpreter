    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the object**: The question asks about grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot. A trefoil knot is the simplest non-trivial knot, and it exists in two non-equivalent mirror-image forms: right-hand and left-hand.\n\n2.  **Define Grid Diagram**: A grid diagram is a representation of a knot on an $n \\times n$ grid. According to the standard definition used in knot theory (especially in connection with knot Floer homology), an $n \\times n$ grid diagram consists of $n$ markings called 'X' and $n$ markings called 'O', placed on the grid squares, subject to the rule that every row and every column must contain exactly one 'X' and one 'O'.\n\n3.  **Minimal Grid Number**: The grid number of a knot is the minimum size 'n' of the grid required to represent it. For the trefoil knot (both left-hand and right-hand versions), the minimal grid number is 3. This means we must analyze 3x3 grid diagrams.\n\n4.  **Algebraic Representation**: A 3x3 grid diagram can be described by a pair of permutations, $(\\sigma_X, \\sigma_O)$, from the symmetric group $S_3$. $\\sigma_X$ specifies the column for each 'X' in a given row, so the 'X' markings are at coordinates $(i, \\sigma_X(i))$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. Similarly, the 'O' markings are at coordinates $(i, \\sigma_O(i))$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. The group $S_3$ has $3! = 6$ permutations.\n\n5.  **Knot Type from Permutations**: The knot type represented by the grid diagram $(\\sigma_X, \\sigma_O)$ is determined by the composite permutation $\\pi = \\sigma_X \\sigma_O^{-1}$. A key result states that for a 3x3 grid, the diagram represents a trefoil knot if and only if $\\pi$ is a 3-cycle.\n\n6.  **Identifying the Left-Hand Trefoil**: The group $S_3$ has two 3-cycles: $c = (123)$ and $c^2 = (132)$. By convention, one corresponds to the right-hand trefoil and the other to the left-hand trefoil. Let's assume (without loss of generality, as the counting will be identical for the other choice) that $\\pi = c^2 = (132)$ represents the left-hand trefoil.\n\n7.  **Finding all Left-Hand Trefoil Diagrams**: We need to find all pairs $(\\sigma_X, \\sigma_O)$ such that $\\sigma_X \\sigma_O^{-1} = c^2$. For any choice of $\\sigma_O$ from the 6 permutations in $S_3$, $\\sigma_X$ is uniquely determined as $\\sigma_X = c^2 \\sigma_O$. Therefore, there are exactly 6 distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil. Let's call this set of 6 diagrams $S_{LHT}$.\n\n8.  **Analyze Symmetries**: The question asks to count the diagrams \"up to translation and rotation\". This means we must count the number of equivalence classes (orbits) of the set $S_{LHT}$ under the action of the group generated by grid translations and rotations.\n\n9.  **Action of Translations**: A translation shifts the entire grid cyclically, either horizontally, vertically, or both. A translation applied to a grid diagram does not change the knot type invariant $\\pi = \\sigma_X \\sigma_O^{-1}$. We analyze the action of the 9 possible translations on our set of 6 diagrams. By explicitly calculating the translated diagrams, we find that the 6 diagrams in $S_{LHT}$ fall into two distinct orbits under translation.\n    *   Let $G_1, \\ldots, G_6$ be the 6 diagrams.\n    *   Orbit 1 under translation: $\\{G_1, G_4, G_5\\}$\n    *   Orbit 2 under translation: $\\{G_2, G_3, G_6\\}$\n    So, up to translation alone, there are 2 unique grid diagrams.\n\n10. **Action of Rotations**: We must now consider rotations of the grid. Let's analyze the effect of a 90-degree clockwise rotation ($R_{90}$) on a diagram.\n    *   First, we determine if $R_{90}$ changes the knot type. An analysis of how the permutation pair transforms shows that a 90-degree rotation maps a diagram for a left-hand trefoil to another diagram for a left-hand trefoil. The knot invariant transforms as $\\pi \\to w_0\\pi^{-1}w_0$, which for the trefoil cycles maps $c^2 \\to c^2$ and $c \\to c$. So handedness is preserved.\n    *   A 180-degree rotation, however, transforms the invariant as $\\pi \\to w_0\\pi w_0$, which maps $c^2 \\to c$. This means it turns a left-hand trefoil diagram into a right-hand trefoil diagram.\n    *   For the equivalence relation to be well-defined on the set $S_{LHT}$, we only consider transformations that map diagrams in $S_{LHT}$ to other diagrams in $S_{LHT}$. So we check if rotations merge the two translation orbits.\n    *   Let's apply a 90-degree rotation to a representative of the first translation orbit, for example, $G_1$. Explicit calculation of the coordinates of the rotated markers shows that $R_{90}(G_1)$ is precisely the diagram $G_6$.\n    *   Diagram $G_1$ is in the first translation orbit, and diagram $G_6$ is in the second. The existence of a rotation ($R_{90}$) that connects an element of the first orbit to an element of the second orbit proves that the two orbits are part of a single, larger orbit under the full group of translations and rotations.\n\n11. **Conclusion**: Since all 6 diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot are connected by a sequence of translations and rotations, they all belong to a single equivalence class. Therefore, there is only one unique minimal grid diagram for the left-hand trefoil knot up to translation and rotation.\n\nFinal answer: 1."
