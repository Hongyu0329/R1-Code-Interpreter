    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific philosophical distinction made by a member of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n2.  **Deconstruct the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** A prominent Polish school of logic and analytic philosophy active between the World Wars. Key members include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   **Hallmark:** This is a general term for an indicator, a mark, or a sign (in Polish, *oznaka*). It's something that points to the existence of something else.\n    *   **Decomposition into \"Symptoms\" and \"Signals\":** This is the specific distinction in question. We need to understand what this distinction entails to identify the correct philosopher.\n        *   **Symptom (*objaw*):** This implies a natural sign. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on a causal or natural correlation. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. This connection is discovered in nature.\n        *   **Signal (*sygnał*):** This implies a conventional or artificial sign. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on human agreement, rules, or convention. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"tree\" is a signal for a tree. This connection is created or assigned by humans.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates from the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   While many philosophers in this school dealt with language and logic, the work on semiotics (the theory of signs) and epistemology is most relevant here.\n    *   We need to find the philosopher whose work explicitly categorizes signs in this manner as a core part of their analysis of language and knowledge.\n\n4.  **Identify the Correct Philosopher:**\n    *   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher most famously associated with this distinction. In his works on semantics, epistemology, and the philosophy of language (e.g., in his influential paper \"Language and Meaning\"), he provided a detailed analysis of signs.\n    *   He precisely categorized signs (*oznaka*) into **symptoms (*objawy*)** and **signals (*sygnały*)**, also called conventional signs (*znaki konwencjonalne*).\n    *   This distinction was fundamental to his theory of meaning and his analysis of how language connects to the world and how we justify our beliefs.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Translation:** The term \"hallmark\" is a reasonable English translation for the Polish *oznaka*, but \"sign\" or \"indicator\" are also common and accurate. The key is understanding it as a general category that is then subdivided.\n*   **Context:** This distinction is not merely a linguistic observation but a crucial part of Ajdukiewicz's broader philosophical project concerning meaning, knowledge, and scientific language. It helps differentiate between empirical evidence (symptoms) and symbolic representation (signals).\n*   **Exclusivity:** While other philosophers have made similar distinctions (e.g., Peirce's index vs. symbol), the specific terminology of \"symptom\" and \"signal\" for this dichotomy within the Lviv-Warsaw School is the signature contribution of Ajdukiewicz.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the Lviv-Warsaw School's members and their philosophical contributions, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the one who decomposed the notion of a hallmark (sign) into symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs).\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
