    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside Sir Launfal.\n\n**Step 1: Identify \"Sir Launfal\" and its manuscript.**\nThe question refers to the Middle English romance \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. This poem is a specific adaptation of an earlier story. Crucially, Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in only one single manuscript: **British Library, Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**. Therefore, the \"book of manners\" in question must also be present in this same manuscript.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the contents of the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii.**\nThis manuscript is a large anthology, sometimes called the \"Cotton Romances,\" dating from the mid-15th century. It contains a collection of popular romances and other poems, likely compiled for a gentry or merchant-class audience rather than the high nobility. The contents include famous romances such as:\n*   *Lybeaus Desconus*\n*   *Octavian*\n*   *Emaré*\n*   *The Erl of Tolous*\n*   *Sir Eglamour of Artois*\n*   *Sir Tryamour*\n*   And, of course, *Sir Launfal*\n\n**Step 3: Search for a \"book of manners\" within the manuscript's contents.**\nA \"book of manners,\" or a courtesy book, is a didactic text that gives instruction on proper social conduct, etiquette, and the skills required for a particular social station. We must examine the titles in Cotton MS Caligula A.ii to find one that fits this description. Most of the works are narrative romances focused on chivalric adventure.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct text.**\nAmong the various romances and tales in the manuscript is a poem titled ***The Squire of Low Degree***. While this work is structured as a romance—telling the story of a squire who loves a king's daughter—a substantial portion of the poem is dedicated to the King of Hungary outlining the detailed education and set of duties the squire must undertake to be worthy of his daughter. This lengthy passage details instructions on:\n*   Courtly service (how to act as a cupbearer and carver)\n*   Chivalric training (jousting)\n*   Leisure pursuits (hunting, hawking, fishing)\n*   Musical accomplishments (playing the harp, lute, and rote)\n\nBecause of this strong focus on the education and proper conduct of a young man aspiring to a higher status, *The Squire of Low Degree* functions as a \"book of manners\" embedded within a romance narrative. It is the text in this manuscript that most closely fits the description in the question.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\" in the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii is *The Squire of Low Degree*.\n\n<<<The Squire of Low Degree>>>"
