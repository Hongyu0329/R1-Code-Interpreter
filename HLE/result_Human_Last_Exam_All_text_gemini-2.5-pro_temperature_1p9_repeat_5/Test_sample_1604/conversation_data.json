    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to identify a painting by the artist Lady Butler (Elizabeth Thompson) and determine which of the battles she depicted occurred at the latest point in history. This is about the date of the event, not the date the painting was created.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Lady Butler and her Subject Matter**\nLady Elizabeth Butler (1846–1933) was a famous British painter who specialized in military scenes. Her work primarily covered British military campaigns from the Napoleonic Wars up to World War I.\n\n**Step 3: List a Representative Sample of Her Famous Battle Paintings and their Historical Dates**\nTo find the latest battle, we need to survey her work and the dates of the events they show.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875)\n    *   **Battle:** Battle of Quatre Bras\n    *   **War:** Napoleonic Wars\n    *   **Historical Date:** **June 16, 1815**\n\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted 1881)\n    *   **Battle:** The charge of the Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo\n    *   **War:** Napoleonic Wars\n    *   **Historical Date:** **June 18, 1815**\n\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874)\n    *   **Battle:** An imagined roll call after the Battle of Inkerman\n    *   **War:** Crimean War\n    *   **Historical Date:** **November 5, 1854**\n\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880)\n    *   **Battle:** Battle of Rorke's Drift\n    *   **War:** Anglo-Zulu War\n    *   **Historical Date:** **January 22-23, 1879**\n\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882)\n    *   **Battle:** An incident during the Battle of Laing's Nek\n    *   **War:** First Boer War\n    *   **Historical Date:** **January 28, 1881**\n\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted 1893)\n    *   **Battle/Campaign:** The Nile Expedition to relieve General Gordon\n    *   **War:** The Mahdist War\n    *   **Historical Date:** **1884–1885**\n\n**Step 4: Check for Paintings Depicting Even Later Conflicts**\nLady Butler lived until 1933 and was still active as an artist during World War I. We need to check if she painted any scenes from that conflict.\n\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards***\n    *   **Battle:** The Great Retreat from Mons\n    *   **War:** World War I\n    *   **Historical Date:** **August 1914**\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Dates and Conclude**\nLet's list the historical dates of the events depicted in chronological order:\n1.  Battle of Waterloo / Quatre Bras: **1815**\n2.  Battle of Inkerman (Crimean War): **1854**\n3.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n4.  Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n5.
