    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Parametric Curve:**\n    The curve is defined piecewise. We need to analyze each piece separately to understand the overall shape.\n    The equations are $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = b\\sin(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Piece: $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    *   In this interval, $b=1$.\n    *   The parametric equations become $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$.\n    *   These are the standard equations for a circle. Since $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, this traces the upper half of the unit circle ($x^2 + y^2 = 1, y \\ge 0$).\n    *   Let's find the range of x and y coordinates for this part:\n        *   The maximum x-value is $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n        *   The minimum x-value is $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n        *   The maximum y-value is $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$.\n        *   The minimum y-value is $\\sin(0) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n    *   So, for this piece, $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Piece: $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    *   In this interval, $b=5$.\n    *   The parametric equations become $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$.\n    *   These equations describe an ellipse. We can write this as $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$. Since $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, this traces the lower half of an ellipse with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5.\n    *   Let's find the range of x and y coordinates for this part:\n        *   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\cos(t)$ ranges from $-1$ to $1$.\n        *   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\sin(t)$ ranges from $0$ down to $-1$ and back to $0$. Therefore, $y = 5\\sin(t)$ ranges from $0$ down to $5(-1) = -5$ and back to $0$.\n    *   So, for this piece, $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 0]$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure:**\n    To find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum x and y coordinates (the bounding box). We combine the ranges from both pieces.\n    *   **X-range:** The x-values for the whole figure range from $\\min(-1, -1) = -1$ to $\\max(1, 1) = 1$.\n    *   **Y-range:** The y-values for the whole figure range from $\\min(0, -5) = -5$ to $\\max(1, 0) = 1$.\n    *   The width of the bounding box is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   The height of the bounding box is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n5.  **Find the Side Length of the Smallest Enclosing Square:**\n    A square that encloses a rectangle must have a side length at least as large as both the width and the height of the rectangle. To be the *smallest* such square, its side length must be equal to the larger of the two dimensions.\n    *   Side of square, $S = \\max(\\text{width, height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Area of the Square:**\n    The area of a square with side length $S$ is $S^2$.\n    *   Area $= 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to recognize that the parameter `b` changes, creating a composite figure from two different curves (a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse).\n*   The extrema (min/max values) for x and y must be determined over the entire range of `t`, considering both pieces of the curve.\n*   The question asks for the area of the smallest **square**, not the smallest rectangle. The side length of the enclosing square is dictated by the longest dimension of the figure's bounding box.\n*   The term \"outcircles\" is used here to mean \"encloses\" or \"circumscribes\".\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Overall x-range: [-1, 1]. Total width = 2.\n*   Overall y-range: [-5, 1]. Total height = 6.\n*   Side length of the smallest enclosing square = max(2, 6) = 6.\n*   Area = $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
