The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ is a bilinear form representing twice the quadratic part of the Euclidean action. In position space, it is given by $(\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \phi(\vec{x}, \tau) (-\partial_\tau^2 - \vec{\nabla}^2 + m^2) \phi(\vec{x}, \tau)$. In momentum space, which makes the temperature dependence explicit, it is $(\phi, D_\phi) = T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3} (\omega_n^2 + \vec{k}^2 + m^2) |\tilde{\phi}(\omega_n, \vec{k})|^2$, where $\omega_n=2\pi n T$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.
