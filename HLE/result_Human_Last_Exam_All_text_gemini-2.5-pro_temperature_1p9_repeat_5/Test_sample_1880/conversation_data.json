    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible polynomial's Galois group acts transitively on its roots. We can use Eisenstein's Criterion.\n\n*   **Polynomial:** $P(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\n*   **Prime Selection:** Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n*   **Conditions:**\n    1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading one (it divides 0, 0, 8, and 14).\n    2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient (which is 1).\n    3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term (4 does not divide 14).\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all conditions are met, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, its Galois group, $G$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$, $A_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $V_4$ (Klein four-group), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Discriminant\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of the polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group, $A_n$. The group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field ($\\mathbb{Q}$).\n\n*   **Formula:** For a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n*   **Values:** For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   $p^4 = 8^4 = 4096$\n    *   $q^3 = 14^3 = 2744$\n    *   $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n    *   $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n    *   $\\Delta = 591872$\n*   **Check for Perfect Square:** An integer is a perfect square only if its last digit is 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. The number 591872 ends in 2, so it cannot be a perfect square of an integer. Thus, $\\sqrt{591872}$ is not a rational number.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining options for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic polynomial helps to further narrow down the possible Galois groups.\n\n*   **Formula:** For a polynomial $x^4 + ax^2 + bx + c$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - ay^2 - 4cy + (4ac - b^2)$.\n*   **Values:** For our polynomial, $a=0$, $b=8$, and $c=14$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   $R(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 - 4(14)y + (4(0)(14) - 8^2)$\n    *   $R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n*   **Check for Rational Roots:** We use the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$. Let's test these values:\n    *   $R(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n    *   $R(-1) = -1 + 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n    *   $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n*   **Conclusion:** Since $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group cannot be $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Results and Final Determination\nCombining our findings:\n1.  The polynomial is irreducible.\n2.  The discriminant is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ ($G \\not\\subseteq A_4$).\n3.  The resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis combination of properties rules out $S_4, A_4,$ and $V_4$. The only remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $D_4$ and $C_4$. To distinguish between these two, we check if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\n*   If $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $D_4$.\n*   If $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $C_4$.\n\nLet's find the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$:\n*   $\\Delta = 591872 = 1024 \\times 578 = 1024 \\times 2 \\times 289 = (32)^2 \\times 2 \\times (17)^2 = (32 \\times 17)^2 \\times 2 = (544)^2 \\times 2$.\n*   $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{(544)^2 \\times 2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNow we test if $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A quartic polynomial without $x^3$ and $x$ terms can be factored into two quadratics of the form $(x^2+kx+l)(x^2-kx+m)$. Here, $k^2$ is a root of the resolvent cubic. Since we need to factor over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we look for a root of the resolvent that gives $k \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe rational root of the resolvent cubic is $y=8$. Let $k^2=8$, which gives $k = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value of $k$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nNow we find the coefficients $l$ and $m$:\n*   Expanding $(x^2+kx+l)(x^2-kx+m)$ gives $x^4+(l+m-k^2)x^2+k(m-l)x+lm$.\n*   Comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n    *   $l+m-k^2 = 0 \\implies l+m = k^2 = 8$.\n    *   $k(m-l) = 8 \\implies 2\\sqrt{2}(m-l) = 8 \\implies m-l = \\frac{8}{2\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   We solve the system of equations:\n    1.  $l+m = 8$\n    2.  $m-l = 2\\sqrt{2}$\n*   Adding the two equations: $2m = 8 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\implies m = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$.\n*   Subtracting the second from the first: $2l = 8 - 2\\sqrt{2} \\implies l = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$.\n*   The coefficients $l=4-\\sqrt{2}$ and $m=4+\\sqrt{2}$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Checking the constant term: $lm = (4-\\sqrt{2})(4+\\sqrt{2}) = 16 - 2 = 14$. This is correct.\n\nSince we found a factorization $(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})$ where all coefficients are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion on Group:** The Galois group is $D_4$.\n\n### Final Answer: The Order of the Galois Group\nThe question asks for the order of the Galois group. The group is the dihedral group of order 8, $D_4$, which represents the symmetries of a square. The order of $D_4$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
