    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear time-invariant system described by matrices `A` and `B`. The feedback control law is given by `u = Fx`, which modifies the system dynamics to `x_dot = (A + BF)x`. We need to choose `F` such that the eigenvalues of the resulting closed-loop matrix, `A_cl = A + BF`, are at the desired locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Step 2: Define the System Matrices and the Gain Matrix**\nThe given matrices are:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe state vector `x` is 2x1 and the input `u` is 2x1 (inferred from the 2 columns of B). The feedback gain `F` must be a 2x2 matrix for the matrix multiplication `Fx` to be valid and result in a 2x1 vector. Let's define `F` with unknown elements:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix**\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n`BF = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]]`\n`BF = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNext, we form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`.\nThe desired characteristic polynomial, `p(λ)`, is formed from these roots:\n`p(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j²`\n`p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\nSo the desired characteristic equation is `λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is given by `λ² - tr(M)λ + det(M) = 0`, where `tr(M) = a + d` is the trace and `det(M) = ad - bc` is the determinant.\nFor our closed-loop matrix `A_cl`:\n`tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + (f2) = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n\n`det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n`det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n`det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1*f2 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n`det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is:\n`λ² - (f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4) = 0`\n\n**Step 6: Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\nWe match the coefficients of our calculated polynomial with the desired polynomial `λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n1.  **Matching the `λ` coefficients:**\n    `-(f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1) = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1 = -2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1` (Equation 1)\n\n2.  **Matching the constant terms:**\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `- f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This indicates that there are infinitely many solutions for the gain matrix `F`. We can find a particular solution by making simplifying assumptions. A common approach is to set some elements of `F` to zero.\n\nLet's assume `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\nEquation 1 becomes:\n`f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1`\n`f1 + f2 = -1`\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n`-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2(0) - 2(0) - 2*f1(0) = 3`\n`-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations:\n(a) `f1 + f2 = -1`\n(b) `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nAdding equation (a) and (b):\n`(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into equation (a):\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nThus, we have found one possible solution for F: `f1=1, f2=-2, f3=0, f4=0`.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer**\nThe calculated state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **System Type:** This is a Multi-Input system (B has 2 columns), so the solution for `F` is not unique. Any valid solution is acceptable.\n*   **Control Law:** The problem specifies `A + BF` for the closed-loop matrix. Pay attention to the sign. If it were `A - BF`, the equations would change.\n*   **Algebra:** The expansion of the determinant and the solving of the simultaneous equations are critical points where errors can occur. It's good to double-check these calculations.\n*   **Verification (Optional but Recommended):** We can plug our found `F` back into `A_cl = A + BF` and compute its eigenvalues to confirm they are indeed `-1 ± j`.\n    With `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`, `A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`.\n    The characteristic equation is `λ(λ+2) - (-1)(2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`, whose roots are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = -1 ± j`. The solution is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
