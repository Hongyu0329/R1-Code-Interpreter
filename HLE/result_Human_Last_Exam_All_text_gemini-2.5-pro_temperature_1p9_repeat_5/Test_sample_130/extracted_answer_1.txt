The edges of the image will move, simplify, and straighten. Specifically, any curved part of an edge will flatten out, and any sharp corner will be rounded and then straightened. The speed at which an edge moves is proportional to its local curvature. This means convex regions (like a white circle on a black background) will shrink, while concave regions (like a black hole in a white area) will be filled in. As a result, any small features, speckles, or thin lines (whose boundaries have high curvature) will be eliminated entirely. The final state of the image as $t \rightarrow \infty$ is one where all remaining edges have been transformed into straight lines, and the overall shapes have been simplified into large polygons.
