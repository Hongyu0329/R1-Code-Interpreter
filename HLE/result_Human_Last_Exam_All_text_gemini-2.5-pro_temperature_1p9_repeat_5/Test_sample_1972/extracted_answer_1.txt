The question conflates Jorge Luis Borges's praise for two different novels. The quote "the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve" refers to Adolfo Bioy Casares's **_The Invention of Morel_**. The description of an author as a "continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner" refers to Juan Rulfo, author of **_Pedro PÃ¡ramo_**. There is no single novel to which Borges applied both descriptions.
