    "This is an excellent question that delves into the specific critical opinions of Jorge Luis Borges. It appears to combine two distinct commendations that Borges gave to two different novels by two different authors. Let's analyze the clues step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the first clue - The Quote**\n\n*   **The Clue:** The novel is praised for having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **Analysis:** This is one of Borges's most famous lines of literary praise. It comes from the prologue he wrote in 1940 for his close friend Adolfo Bioy Casares's novel, **_La invención de Morel_ (_The Invention of Morel_)**.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\"**: This refers to the novel's impeccable and rigorous logic. It is a tightly constructed plot that functions like a mystery or a puzzle, where the protagonist (and the reader) must use deduction to understand the fantastic situation he is in.\n    *   **\"The intensity of a tiger\"**: This points to the powerful underlying emotions of the story—a tale of impossible love, loneliness, and a desperate desire for immortality.\n    *   Borges famously used this prologue to praise the novel as \"perfect\" and to argue for a literature of classic plot and suspense over what he considered the undisciplined chaos of purely psychological novels.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the second clue - The Author's Description**\n\n*   **The Clue:** The author is described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n*   **Analysis:** This description refers to the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**, and specifically to his masterpiece, the novel **_Pedro Páramo_** (1955). Borges wrote about Rulfo in various essays and prologues later in his life.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   **\"Continuator of Faulkner\"**: Borges, like many critics, recognized that Rulfo was profoundly influenced by the American modernist William Faulkner. Both authors explored themes of memory, the weight of the past, decaying societies, and utilized non-linear, fragmented narrative structures with multiple points of view.\n    *   **\"(and simplifier)\"**: This is the crucial distinction Borges made. While Faulkner was famous for his long, complex, baroque sentences and dense rhetoric, Rulfo's style is the opposite: stark, laconic, and minimalist. Borges admired this precision, noting that Rulfo achieved the same depth as Faulkner but without his \"rhetorical excesses.\" Rulfo *simplified* the method to its bare, powerful essentials.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesizing the Clues and Identifying the Conflict**\n\n*   The two clues point to two different landmark novels of Latin American literature.\n    *   Clue 1 -> **_The Invention of Morel_** by Adolfo Bioy Casares.\n    *   Clue 2 -> **_Pedro Páramo_** by Juan Rulfo.\n*   The question assumes that Borges applied both descriptions to the same novel and author, but historical and textual evidence shows this is a conflation. Borges's praise for Bioy Casares's novel emphasizes its classical, logical structure, which is quite different from the Faulknerian tradition. His praise for Rulfo focuses specifically on the Faulknerian lineage.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is no single novel that Borges described with both phrases. The question combines two separate and distinct critical statements made about two different works decades apart.\n\n*   The phrase \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" refers to **_The Invention of Morel_** by Adolfo Bioy Casares.\n*   The description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" refers to **Juan Rulfo**, author of **_Pedro Páramo_**.\n\nTherefore, the question is based on a flawed premise.\n\n<<<The question conflates Jorge Luis Borges's praise for two different novels. The quote \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" refers to Adolfo Bioy Casares's **_The Invention of Morel_**. The description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" refers to Juan Rulfo, author of **_Pedro Páramo_**. There is no single novel to which Borges applied both descriptions.>>>"
