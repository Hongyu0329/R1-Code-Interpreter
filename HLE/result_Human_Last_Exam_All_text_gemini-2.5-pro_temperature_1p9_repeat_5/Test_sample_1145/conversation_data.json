    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the probability.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the State**\n*   **System:** A particle confined to a one-dimensional box of length `a`.\n*   **Quantum State:** The particle is in the first excited state, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Interval:** We want to find the particle in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n**2. Write Down the Probability Density Function**\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is:\n$Ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\nThe probability density, `P(x)`, is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n$P(x) = |Ψ_n(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\nFor the state `n = 2`, the probability density is:\n$|Ψ_2(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n**3. Set Up the Probability Integral**\nThe probability `P` of finding the particle between `x₁` and `x₂` is the integral of the probability density function over that interval:\n$P = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} |Ψ_2(x)|^2 dx = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n**4. Analyze the Interval and Choose a Method**\nThe interval of interest is from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n*   The center of the interval is `x_c = 0.5a`.\n*   The width of the interval is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`.\n\nThis interval is very small. We can evaluate the integral using an approximation. Let's check the value of the probability density at the center of the interval:\n$|Ψ_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi) = 0$\nThe center of the interval is a node for the n=2 state, meaning the probability density is zero there. Since the function is not constant but is at a minimum, we should approximate the function around this point.\n\n**5. Approximate the Integrand**\nBecause the interval `Δx` is small, we can approximate the `sin²` function. It is convenient to perform a Taylor expansion of the integrand around the center of the interval, `x = 0.5a`.\nLet's define a new variable `u = x - 0.5a`.\n*   As `x` goes from `0.495a` to `0.505a`, `u` goes from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n*   The argument of the sine function becomes: $\\frac{2\\pi x}{a} = \\frac{2\\pi (u + 0.5a)}{a} = \\frac{2\\pi u}{a} + \\pi$.\n\nNow, we substitute this into the `sin²` term:\n$\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a} + \\pi\\right)$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sin(\\theta)$, we get:\n$\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a} + \\pi\\right) = \\left(-\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)$\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$P = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right) du$\n\nFor the small values of `u` in this interval, the argument of the sine function, $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi u}{a}$, is small. We can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.\n$\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right) \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 u^2}{a^2}$\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the integral:\n$P \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 u^2}{a^2}\\right) du = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} u^2 du$\n\n**6. Evaluate the Final Integral**\nNow, we perform the integration:\n$\\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} u^2 du = \\left[\\frac{u^3}{3}\\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} = \\frac{(0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3}{3} = \\frac{2 \\times (0.005a)^3}{3}$\n\nSubstitute this result back into the expression for `P`:\n$P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left(\\frac{2 \\times (0.005a)^3}{3}\\right)$\nThe `a³` terms cancel out:\n$P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3$\n$P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (5 \\times 10^{-3})^3 = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (125 \\times 10^{-9})$\n$P \\approx \\frac{2000\\pi^2}{3} \\times 10^{-9} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3} \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n**7. Calculate the Numerical Value**\nUsing the value $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$:\n$P \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 9.8696}{3} \\times 10^{-6} \\approx \\frac{19.7392}{3} \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 6.5797 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nThe probability is approximately `0.00000658`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
