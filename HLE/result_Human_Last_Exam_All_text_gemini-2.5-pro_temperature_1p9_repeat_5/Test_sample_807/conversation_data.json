    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify the color of a Crayola crayon that contains a specific chemical compound: 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Compound:** The first step is to determine the common name for the complex chemical provided.\n    *   The chemical name is \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\".\n    *   A search for this IUPAC name reveals that it is the chemical substance known as **Rhodamine B**.\n    *   Rhodamine B is also identified in the Color Index International system as **C.I. Basic Violet 10** or **C.I. 45170**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Color of the Chemical:** The next step is to find out the color of Rhodamine B.\n    *   Rhodamine B is a synthetic chemical dye.\n    *   It is known for its intense, fluorescent color. In solution, it produces a vivid reddish-violet or bright pinkish color. The name \"Basic Violet 10\" also clearly indicates its color family.\n\n3.  **Connect the Chemical to a Crayola Crayon Color:** The final step is to find which Crayola crayon used Rhodamine B (C.I. Basic Violet 10) as a pigment.\n    *   Research into the history of Crayola crayons and their pigments shows that several colors have been retired or had their formulas changed over the years.\n    *   In 1990, Crayola retired eight colors from its 64-count box for the first time. One of these colors was retired because its pigment, Rhodamine B, was no longer considered appropriate for children's crayons after it was determined to be a potential carcinogen and was banned from use in cosmetics.\n    *   The crayon color that used Rhodamine B was **Magenta**. This color had been part of the Crayola lineup since 1949.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Complex Chemical Name:** The primary challenge is correctly identifying the long chemical name as Rhodamine B.\n*   **Historical Context:** The answer relies on historical information. The crayon containing this chemical is no longer in production with that specific formula. Crayola may have reintroduced a color named Magenta, but it uses a different, non-toxic pigment.\n*   **Specificity:** The question asks which color *contains* the chemical, not which one *currently* contains it, making the historical answer correct.\n*   **Other Retired Colors:** It's important not to confuse the reason for retirement. Other colors were retired for different reasons (e.g., \"Indian Red\" and \"Flesh\" were renamed for cultural sensitivity, not chemical composition).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is Rhodamine B. This pigment was historically used by Crayola to create the color Magenta before it was retired in 1990 due to safety concerns.\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
