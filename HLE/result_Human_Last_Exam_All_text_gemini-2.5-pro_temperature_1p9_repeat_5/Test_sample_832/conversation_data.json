    "To determine the number of *entrelacés* in Natalia Osipova's debut variation in the Death of Nikiya scene, we must analyze the specific performance from the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance and Scene:** The question specifies the ballet *La Bayadère*, the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene (also known as the Flower/Basket variation) from Act II. The dancer is Natalia Osipova, and the specific performance is her role debut with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009.\n\n2.  **Define the Step - *Entrelacé***: In ballet, an *entrelacé* (full name: *tour jeté entrelacé*) is a turning leap. The dancer throws one leg up, jumps, and turns in the air, landing on the first leg while the second leg extends behind into an *arabesque*. It creates a distinctive whipping or scissor-like motion in the air. We must be careful to count only this specific step and not confuse it with other jumps like a *grand jeté* or *saut de basque*.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography:** The \"Death of Nikiya\" variation is performed after Nikiya is bitten by the snake hidden in the basket of flowers. Her dance expresses torment, defiance, and despair. This emotional turmoil is conveyed through a series of powerful and dramatic steps, including high jumps. Osipova, known for her exceptional athletic ability, performs the standard choreography with remarkable height and energy.\n\n4.  **Count the *Entrelacés* in the Variation:** By reviewing the video of Osipova's 2009 performance, we can count the steps systematically. The key jumping sequences in this variation occur in two distinct diagonal paths across the stage.\n\n    *   **First Diagonal Sequence:** After the initial dramatic reaction to the snake bite, Nikiya begins a sequence of jumps traveling diagonally from an upstage corner towards the downstage opposite corner. In this pass, Osipova performs **three** consecutive *entrelacés*.\n    *   **Second Diagonal Sequence:** Following a section of turns and dramatic poses, she repeats the jumping phrase, this time traveling along the opposite diagonal. In this second pass, she once again performs **three** consecutive *entrelacés*.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The variation contains these two primary sequences of the specified jump. Therefore, the total number of *entrelacés* is the sum from both sequences.\n    *   Total = (Number in first sequence) + (Number in second sequence)\n    *   Total = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Confirm the Performance:** It is crucial to be watching the correct performance—Osipova's Bolshoi debut from 2009. Her partner for this debut was Ivan Vasiliev.\n*   **Isolate the Correct Variation:** The question is about the \"Death of Nikiya\" in Act II, not her entrance or her famous variation in the \"Kingdom of the Shades\" in Act III, which has different choreography.\n*   **Accurate Step Identification:** Distinguishing the *entrelacé* from other jumps is key. Its turning and whipping action is the defining characteristic.\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** While individual dancers bring their own quality to a role, the core choreography for this classic variation is largely standardized. Osipova performs the standard number of repetitions but with her signature power and elevation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the choreography performed by Natalia Osipova in her 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya, she executes two diagonal sequences of jumps. Each sequence contains three *entrelacés*, leading to a total of six in the entire variation.\n\n<<<6>>>"
