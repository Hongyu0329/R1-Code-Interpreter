    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the group**\nThe semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_n$ where the order is $2^n$.\nSince $512 = 2^9$, we are dealing with the group $SD_9$.\nThe standard presentation for the semidihedral group $SD_n$ (for $n \\ge 4$) is:\n$SD_n = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\nFor our case, $n=9$, so the group is:\n$G = SD_9 = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^7-1} \\rangle$, which is\n$G = SD_9 = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\nThe elements of this group are of the form $r^i$ and $sr^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\n**Step 2: Define and simplify the concept of a power subgroup**\nA power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. More generally, $G^k$ is defined as the subgroup generated by the set of $k$-th powers, i.e., $G^k = \\langle\\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}\\rangle$. For the semidihedral groups, it turns out that the set of $k$-th powers is always a subgroup, so these definitions coincide.\n\nWe analyze the possible values for the exponent $k$:\n*   **Case 1: k is odd.**\n    Since $G=SD_9$ is a group of order $2^9$, the order of any element is a power of 2. For any element $g \\in G$, its order $|g|$ is a power of 2. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(|g|, k) = 1$. This implies that the mapping $\\phi: G \\to G$ defined by $\\phi(g) = g^k$ is a bijection. Thus, every element in $G$ is a $k$-th power of some other element in $G$. This means $G^k = G$. So, for any odd integer $k$, we get the same power subgroup, which is the group $G$ itself.\n\n*   **Case 2: k is even.**\n    Let $k = 2^j \\cdot m$, where $j \\ge 1$ and $m$ is an odd integer.\n    Then $G^k = G^{2^j m} = (G^{2^j})^m$. Let $H_j = G^{2^j}$. The subgroup $H_j$ is a subgroup of a 2-group, so all its elements also have orders that are powers of 2. Since $m$ is odd, the map $h \\mapsto h^m$ is a bijection on $H_j$, which means $(H_j)^m = H_j$.\n    Therefore, $G^k = G^{2^j}$.\n    This crucial point means we only need to find the distinct subgroups of the form $G^{2^j}$ for $j=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the sequence of power subgroups $G^{2^j}$**\nThe elements of $G=SD_9$ are $r^i$ or $sr^i$. We need to compute their powers.\n*   Power of $r^i$: $(r^i)^{2^j} = r^{i \\cdot 2^j}$.\n*   Power of $sr^i$: We first compute $(sr^i)^2$. Using the relation $s r^i s = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1)} = r^{127i}$, we have:\n    $(sr^i)^2 = (sr^i)(sr^i) = s(r^is)r^i = s(sr^{127i})r^i = s^2 r^{127i}r^i = r^{128i} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7}$.\n    Now for higher powers:\n    $(sr^i)^4 = ((sr^i)^2)^2 = (r^{128i})^2 = r^{256i} = 1$.\n    This means for any $j \\ge 2$, $(sr^i)^{2^j} = ((sr^i)^4)^{2^{j-2}} = 1^{2^{j-2}} = 1$.\n\nNow we can determine the subgroups $G^{2^j}$:\n*   **j = 0:** $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G = SD_9$. This is the first power subgroup. Its order is 512.\n*   **j = 1:** $G^{2^1} = G^2$. The set of squares is $\\{g^2 \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{(r^i)^2\\} \\cup \\{(sr^i)^2\\} = \\{r^{2i}\\} \\cup \\{r^{128i}\\}$.\n    The set $\\{r^{2i}\\}$ forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ of order 128.\n    The set $\\{r^{128i}\\}$ forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ of order 2.\n    Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, we have $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle \\subseteq \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    Thus, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{128} \\rangle = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 128.\n*   **j = 2:** $G^{2^2} = G^4$. The set of 4th powers is $\\{g^4 \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{(r^i)^4\\} \\cup \\{(sr^i)^4\\} = \\{r^{4i}\\} \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n    This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/4 = 64$.\n*   **For j â‰¥ 2:** The set of $2^j$-th powers is $\\{g^{2^j}\\} = \\{(r^i)^{2^j}\\} \\cup \\{(sr^i)^{2^j}\\} = \\{r^{i \\cdot 2^j}\\} \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    So, for $j \\ge 2$, the power subgroup $G^{2^j}$ is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$. The order of this subgroup is $256/2^j = 2^{8-j}$.\n\n**Step 4: List the distinct power subgroups and count them**\nWe list the subgroups we found for $j=0, 1, 2, ...$:\n1.  $j=0: G^1 = SD_9$. (Order 512, non-cyclic)\n2.  $j=1: G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. (Order 128, cyclic)\n3.  $j=2: G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. (Order 64, cyclic)\n4.  $j=3: G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$. (Order 32, cyclic)\n5.  $j=4: G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$. (Order 16, cyclic)\n6.  $j=5: G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$. (Order 8, cyclic)\n7.  $j=6: G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$. (Order 4, cyclic)\n8.  $j=7: G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. (Order 2, cyclic)\n9.  $j=8: G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. (Order 1, cyclic)\n\nFor any $j > 8$, since $r^{256}=1$, we have $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, so no new subgroups are generated.\n\nThe list above contains subgroups of distinct orders (512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). Therefore, all these subgroups are distinct. Counting them, we find there are 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\nFinal check: The number of power subgroups in $SD_n$ is $n$. For the semidihedral group of size $512=2^9$, $n=9$. This confirms our result."
