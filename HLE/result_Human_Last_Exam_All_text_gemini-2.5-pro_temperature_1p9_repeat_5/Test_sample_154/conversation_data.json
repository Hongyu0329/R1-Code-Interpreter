    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of simple, non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n*   **Simple graph:** A graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of vertices V with |V| = 5.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if they are structurally the same, meaning there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices that preserves adjacency.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to stating the graph is connected and has no cut-vertices (articulation points). For a graph with more than 2 vertices, this means its vertex connectivity κ(G) is at least 2.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Necessary Conditions\nA key property of a 2-vertex-connected graph G is that the minimum degree of any vertex, denoted δ(G), must be at least 2. If a vertex `v` had degree 1, its single neighbor would be a cut-vertex (unless the graph is just K2, which is not the case here).\n\nFor a graph with n=5 vertices, if δ(G) ≥ 2, the sum of the degrees must be at least 5 * 2 = 10. By the handshaking lemma, the sum of degrees equals 2m (where m is the number of edges). So, 2m ≥ 10, which implies m ≥ 5. The maximum possible number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nThus, we only need to search for graphs with the number of edges `m` in the range 5 ≤ m ≤ 10.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate Graphs by Number of Edges `m`\n\n**Case m = 5:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 2m = 10. With δ(G) ≥ 2 and n=5, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   The only simple connected graph with this degree sequence is the cycle graph C5.\n*   Is C5 2-vertex-connected? Yes. If you remove any vertex from C5, the remaining graph is a path of length 4 (P4), which is connected.\n*   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n**Case m = 6:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 12. We analyze degree sequences with δ(G) ≥ 2. The only possibility is (3, 3, 2, 2, 2).\n*   Any graph realizing this sequence must be the graph formed by adding a single edge (a chord) to a C5. There is only one non-isomorphic way to do this.\n*   This graph, C5 with a chord, is 2-vertex-connected because it's built from a 2-connected graph (C5) by adding an edge, which preserves 2-connectivity.\n*   **Count for m=6: 1**\n\n**Case m = 7:**\n*   The graph G has 7 edges. Its complement, G_bar, has C(5,2) - 7 = 3 edges. It's often easier to analyze the small number of graphs with 3 edges and check if their complements are 2-connected.\n*   There are 4 non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 3 edges:\n    1.  **H = K1,3 (a star/claw) plus an isolated vertex:** The complement G = K5 \\ H will have a vertex of degree 1 (the center of the star in H), so it's not 2-connected.\n    2.  **H = P4 (a path on 4 vertices) plus an isolated vertex:** The complement G = K5 \\ P4 has a minimum degree of 2. Checking for cut-vertices reveals none. So, this graph is 2-connected.\n    3.  **H = C3 (a triangle) plus two isolated vertices:** The complement G = K5 \\ C3 has a minimum degree of 2. It has no cut-vertices and is 2-connected.\n    4.  **H = P3 U K2 (a path on 3 vertices and a separate edge):** The complement G = K5 \\ (P3 U K2) has a minimum degree of 2. It has no cut-vertices and is 2-connected.\n*   The three resulting 2-connected graphs have different degree sequences, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*   **Count for m=7: 3**\n\n**Case m = 8:**\n*   The complement G_bar has 10 - 8 = 2 edges. There are two non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 2 edges:\n    1.  **H = 2K2 (two disjoint edges):** The complement G = K5 \\ 2K2 has a minimum degree of 3. Any graph with δ(G) ≥ n/2 is connected, and in this case, it is 3-connected, hence 2-connected.\n    2.  **H = P3 (two adjacent edges):** The complement G = K5 \\ P3 has a minimum degree of 2. It can be verified that it has no cut-vertices and is 2-connected.\n*   These two graphs have different degree sequences and are non-isomorphic.\n*   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n**Case m = 9:**\n*   The complement G_bar has 10 - 9 = 1 edge. There is only one such graph (up to isomorphism).\n*   The graph G = K5 - e (K5 with one edge removed) is 3-connected, therefore it is 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n**Case m = 10:**\n*   The graph is the complete graph K5.\n*   K5 is 4-vertex-connected, which is greater than 2, so it is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\nSumming the counts for each possible number of edges:\nTotal count = (count for m=5) + (count for m=6) + (count for m=7) + (count for m=8) + (count for m=9) + (count for m=10)\nTotal count = 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9.\n\nThere are 9 such graphs.\n\n<<<9>>>"
