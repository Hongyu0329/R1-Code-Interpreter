    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**The sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.**\nLet's try to find a simple arithmetic or geometric relationship.\n*   **Differences (Subtraction):**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences (9, 12, 28, 68) do not form a simple pattern.\n\n*   **Ratios (Division):**\n    *   11 / 2 = 5.5\n    *   23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n    *   51 / 23 ≈ 2.22\n    The ratios are not constant.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a more complex pattern, such as a combination of multiplication and addition.**\nA common pattern in such sequences is `Next Term = (Previous Term * a) + b`, where 'a' and 'b' can be constant or follow a pattern. Let's try `a=2`, as the numbers are roughly doubling.\n*   From 2 to 11: `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`\n*   From 11 to 23: `11 * 2 + 1 = 23`\n*   From 23 to 51: `23 * 2 + 5 = 46 + 5 = 51`\n*   From 51 to 119: `51 * 2 + 17 = 102 + 17 = 119`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the pattern in the added numbers.**\nThe pattern is that each term (starting from the third term) is twice the previous term plus an adjustment number. Let's analyze the sequence of these adjustment numbers: `1, 5, 17, ...`\n*   We need to find the next number in this new sequence to solve the original problem.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the adjustment sequence (1, 5, 17, ...).**\n*   Find the differences between the terms in this new sequence.\n    *   5 - 1 = 4\n    *   17 - 5 = 12\n*   The sequence of differences is `4, 12, ...`\n\n**Step 5: Find the pattern in the sequence of differences.**\nThe sequence `4, 12, ...` is a simple geometric progression. Each term is 3 times the previous one.\n*   `4 * 3 = 12`\n\n**Step 6: Predict the next terms based on the discovered patterns.**\n*   The next term in the difference sequence `(4, 12, ...)` will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n*   The next term in the adjustment sequence `(1, 5, 17, ...)` will be the last term (17) plus the next difference (36): `17 + 36 = 53`.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final missing number in the original sequence.**\nNow we have all the parts to find the number in the parentheses. The rule is `Next Term = (Previous Term * 2) + Next Adjustment Number`.\n*   Previous Term = 119\n*   Next Adjustment Number = 53\n*   Missing Number = (119 * 2) + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
