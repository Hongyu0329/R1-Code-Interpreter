    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the question\nThe problem asks for the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power, $X = Sym^{15}(C)$, of a genus 3 Riemann surface $C$. The rank of the Neron-Severi group is also known as the Picard number, denoted by $\\rho(X)$.\n\n### Careful points to consider\n1.  **The structure of $Sym^n(C)$:** The n-th symmetric power of a curve C is not always a simple object to analyze. Its geometry depends crucially on the relation between n and the genus g of the curve.\n2.  **The Neron-Severi group:** The Neron-Severi group $NS(X)$ is the group of algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on a variety X. Its rank $\\rho(X)$ is the dimension of the $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space $NS(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  **Dependence on the curve C:** The rank of the Neron-Severi group of $Sym^{15}(C)$ will depend on the specific geometric properties of the genus 3 curve $C$. Not all genus 3 curves are the same; for instance, some are hyperelliptic, and some have special endomorphisms in their Jacobians (Complex Multiplication). We need to consider the full range of possibilities for $C$.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation\n\n**Step 1: Relate $\\rho(Sym^{15}(C))$ to the Jacobian of C**\n\nLet $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ and $X = Sym^n(C)$ its n-th symmetric power. There is a canonical map $\\pi: Sym^n(C) \\to Pic^n(C)$ which sends an effective divisor $D$ to its line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$. The target space $Pic^n(C)$ is a principal homogeneous space for the Jacobian $J(C)=Pic^0(C)$, and as a complex variety, it is isomorphic to $J(C)$.\n\nThe fibers of this map are the complete linear systems $|D| = \\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)))$. The dimension of these fibers is given by $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - 1$.\n\nIn our case, $g=3$ and $n=15$. The degree of any divisor $D \\in Sym^{15}(C)$ is 15. We can determine $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D))$ using the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n$h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = \\deg(D) - g + 1 = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13$.\n\nBy Serre duality, $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = h^0(C, K_C - D)$, where $K_C$ is the canonical divisor. The degree of $K_C - D$ is $(2g-2) - n = (2 \\cdot 3 - 2) - 15 = 4 - 15 = -11$. Since the degree is negative, a generic divisor cannot have sections, so $h^0(C, K_C - D) = 0$. This holds for all D in this case.\n\nTherefore, $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = 0$ for all $D \\in Sym^{15}(C)$. This means that $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D))$ is constant for all $D$ and equals 13.\nSince the fiber dimension is constant ($13-1=12$), the map $\\pi: Sym^{15}(C) \\to Pic^{15}(C)$ is a projective bundle, with fibers isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\n\nFor a projective bundle $E \\to B$, where $E = \\mathbb{P}(\\mathcal{V})$ is the projectivization of a vector bundle $\\mathcal{V}$ over a smooth variety $B$, the rank of the Neron-Severi group is given by $\\rho(E) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\nHere, $E = X = Sym^{15}(C)$ and the base is $B = Pic^{15}(C) \\cong J(C)$. So we have the fundamental relationship:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the range of values for $\\rho(J(C))$**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of the Picard number $\\rho(J(C))$ for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve $C$.\n$J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. The rank of its Neron-Severi group, $\\rho(J(C))$, is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(J(C))$. For an abelian variety of dimension $g$, $h^{1,1} = g^2$.\nFor $g=3$, we have the theoretical bounds $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$. We need to show that these bounds are achieved for Jacobians of some genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest possible rank $\\rho(J(C))$**\n\nThe Neron-Severi group of any projective variety has rank at least 1, since it must contain an ample class. For the Jacobian $J(C)$, the principal polarization given by the theta divisor ensures that $\\rho(J(C)) \\ge 1$.\nThis minimum value is achieved for a generic curve $C$. A generic curve of genus 3 (for instance, one defined by a generic plane quartic equation) has the property that its Jacobian has only the trivial endomorphisms, i.e., $End(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nIn this case, the Neron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the principal polarization. Thus, its rank is 1.\nSo, the smallest possible value is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the largest possible rank $\\rho(J(C))$**\n\nThe maximum possible rank is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$. This occurs for certain abelian varieties with complex multiplication (CM). We need to determine if there exists a genus 3 curve $C$ whose Jacobian $J(C)$ attains this maximum rank.\nAn abelian variety of dimension $g$ has $\\rho=g^2$ if it is of CM type and is isogenous to a product $E^g$, where $E$ is a CM elliptic curve, with a suitable principal polarization.\nA well-known example of a curve whose Jacobian has these properties is the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation $x^4+y^4+z^4=0$. This is a smooth plane curve of genus $g=3$.\nIts Jacobian, $J(F_4)$, is isogenous to the product $E^3$, where $E$ is the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3-x$, which has complex multiplication by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. It is a known result from the theory of complex multiplication that the Picard number of $J(F_4)$ is maximal.\nThus, $\\rho(J(F_4)) = 9$. This shows that the upper bound can be achieved.\nSo, the largest possible value is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the smallest and largest ranks for X**\n\nUsing the relation from Step 1, we can now calculate the final answers.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank of $NS(X)$:**\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank of $NS(X)$:**\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
