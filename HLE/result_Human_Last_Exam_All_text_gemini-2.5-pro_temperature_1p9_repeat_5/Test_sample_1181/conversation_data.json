    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific character in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key detail is the character's specific feeling: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This points to a piece of dialogue that reveals a character's inner conflictâ€”nostalgia for Earth coupled with a sense of embarrassment or shame about that very human feeling.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Characters:**\n    *   **Kris Kelvin (A):** The protagonist. The film begins and ends at his home on Earth, surrounded by nature. He is deeply connected to Earth and his past. While he certainly misses Earth, his nostalgia is a central, overt theme of his journey, not something he expresses shame over. He actively engages with his memories.\n    *   **Hari (B):** She is a \"guest,\" a replica of Kris's deceased wife created by the Solaris ocean. She has no genuine memories of Earth and learns about it only through Kris. Therefore, she could not miss something she has never experienced.\n    *   **Dr. Snaut (C):** A cyberneticist who has been on the space station for a long time. He is portrayed as cynical, philosophical, and weary. He often reflects on the human condition and the purpose of their mission. Given his long isolation, it's plausible he would harbor a deep longing for Earth, and his cynical, scientific persona might cause him to feel ashamed of such a \"sentimental\" emotion.\n    *   **Dr. Sartorius (D):** A hard-nosed, pragmatic scientist. He is emotionally detached and views feelings as a hindrance to scientific inquiry. It is highly inconsistent with his character to admit to missing something from Earth, let alone feel shame about it. He would likely suppress such a feeling entirely.\n    *   **Dr. Gibarian (E):** He commits suicide before Kris arrives. We only see him in a video recording and as a \"guest.\" His messages are filled with despair and warnings, not nostalgic confessions tinged with shame.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Scene:** The line in question is spoken during a poignant philosophical conversation between Kris Kelvin and Dr. Snaut in the space station's library. Snaut reflects on humanity's true desires, suggesting they don't seek other worlds but seek a mirror. He then makes a personal confession.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Dialogue:** Dr. Snaut says to Kris (translations may vary slightly): *\"I do have some thoughts though, once in a while. I am a little bit ashamed of them, I must confess...\"* He goes on to explain his loneliness and then says, *\"It is just that I miss the sound of rustling leaves.\"* This dialogue explicitly matches the question's premise: the character is Snaut, and he expresses shame (\"I am a little bit ashamed\") for missing this simple sound from Earth.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the character analysis and the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves.\n\n<<<C>>>"
