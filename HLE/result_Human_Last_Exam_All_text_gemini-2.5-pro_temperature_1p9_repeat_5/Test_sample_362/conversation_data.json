    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction in question.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Reaction Type:** The problem explicitly states it is a **Wittig reaction**. This reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes from carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones) and phosphorus ylides (Wittig reagents). The general transformation is: `R₂C=O + Ph₃P=CR'R'' → R₂C=CR'R'' + Ph₃P=O`.\n*   **Reactant 1 (Carbonyl):** **Pivalaldehyde**.\n    *   The \"pival-\" prefix refers to the pivaloyl group, which contains a tert-butyl group (`(CH₃)₃C-`).\n    *   The \"-aldehyde\" suffix indicates the presence of a `-CHO` functional group.\n    *   Therefore, the structure of pivalaldehyde is `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Wittig Reagent):** **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**.\n    *   This is the IUPAC name for a phosphorus ylide.\n    *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane` refers to the `(C₆H₅)₃P` (or `Ph₃P`) core.\n    *   `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)` describes the organic group attached to the phosphorus.\n        *   `ethylidene`: A two-carbon group, `-CH-CH₂-`, attached to the phosphorus at the first carbon. The ylide forms at this carbon.\n        *   `2-(2-chlorophenyl)`: A 2-chlorophenyl group (a chlorine atom at the ortho position of a benzene ring) is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene group.\n    *   The full structure of the ylide is `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Connectivity of the Product\nIn a Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl compound and the `Ph₃P` group of the ylide are eliminated (forming triphenylphosphine oxide, `Ph₃P=O`). The remaining carbon skeletons are joined by a new double bond.\n*   From Pivalaldehyde (`(CH₃)₃C-CH=O`), we get the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` fragment.\n*   From the Ylide (`Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`), we get the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)` fragment.\n*   Connecting these two fragments at the double bond gives the product's carbon skeleton: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry (A Careful Point)\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting alkene (whether it is the Z or E isomer) is a critical consideration in a Wittig reaction. This is determined by the nature of the ylide.\n*   **Unstabilized Ylides:** Ylides where the carbanion is adjacent to hydrogen or alkyl groups are considered \"unstabilized\" or \"non-stabilized\". They are highly reactive and their reactions are typically under kinetic control. With aldehydes, they predominantly form the **Z-alkene** (cis).\n*   **Stabilized Ylides:** Ylides where the carbanion is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like `-C=O`, `-CN`, `-COOR`) are \"stabilized\" by resonance. They are less reactive, and the reaction is often reversible and under thermodynamic control, predominantly forming the more stable **E-alkene** (trans).\n\nLet's analyze our ylide: `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`. The carbanionic carbon (the one bonded to P) is bonded to a hydrogen and a ` -CH₂-(Aryl)` group. Since there is no electron-withdrawing group directly attached to this carbon to stabilize the negative charge via resonance, this is an **unstabilized ylide**.\n\nSince we are reacting an unstabilized ylide with an aldehyde (pivalaldehyde), the reaction is kinetically controlled and the major product will be the **Z-isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Final Product Structure and Name\n1.  **Structure:** The Z-isomer is the one where the highest-priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side.\n    *   On the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` carbon, the priority groups are `-C(CH₃)₃` > `-H`.\n    *   On the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)` carbon, the priority groups are `-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)` > `-H`.\n    *   Therefore, in the Z-isomer, the bulky tert-butyl group and the 2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl group are on the same side of the double bond.\n2.  **Name:** We need to name the structure `(Z)-(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons (`-CH=CH-CH₂-` plus the two carbons of the tert-butyl group in the chain). Let's number it correctly: `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n        *   Numbering starts from the `CH₂` group attached to the ring to give the double bond the lowest number (position 2).\n        *   Chain: `[Cl-C₆H₄]-CH₂¹-CH²=CH³-C⁴(CH₃)₃`\n    *   Combining the name with the stereochemistry gives the final product name.\n\n**Final Product:** (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene >>>"
