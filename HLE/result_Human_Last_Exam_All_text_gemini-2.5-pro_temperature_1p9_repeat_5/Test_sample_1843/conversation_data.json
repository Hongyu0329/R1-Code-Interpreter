    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the structure of Dirichlet Characters**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nIf $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$, then any character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$\nwhere $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n*   **Conductor**: A character $\\chi$ is **primitive** with conductor $N$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n*   **Order**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n\n**2. Factorize N and identify the component moduli**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\n$N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$\n\nWe are looking for a primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $N$. This means $\\chi$ must be a product of primitive characters:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive modulo its respective modulus.\n\n**3. Analyze the component primitive characters and their orders**\n\nFor each modulus $p^k$, we need to find the number of primitive characters and their possible orders. The number of characters of order $d$ in the character group $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$ is $\\phi(d)$, provided $d$ divides the order of the group, $\\phi(m)$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**:\n    *   The group of characters mod 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. It has $\\phi(4)=2$ characters.\n    *   The characters induced from mod 2 are 1 (the trivial one).\n    *   The number of primitive characters mod 4 is $2-1=1$. This character has order 2.\n    *   Let $d_4 = \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)$. We have $d_4 = 2$. Number of choices: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**:\n    *   The group of characters mod 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. It has $\\phi(9)=6$ characters.\n    *   The non-primitive characters are induced from mod 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters, with orders 1 and 2.\n    *   The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6-2=4$.\n    *   The group $C_6$ has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 6. Since the non-primitive characters have orders 1 and 2, the primitive characters must have orders 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$. Number of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$. Total: $2+2=4$.\n    *   Let $d_9 = \\text{ord}(\\chi_9)$. Possible orders are $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. Number of choices: 4.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**:\n    *   The group of characters mod 7 is $\\cong C_6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive.\n    *   Number of primitive characters: $\\phi(7)-1 = 5$.\n    *   Possible orders are divisors of 6 (except 1): 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$. Number of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$. Number of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$. Total: $1+2+2=5$.\n    *   Let $d_7 = \\text{ord}(\\chi_7)$. Possible orders are $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$. Number of choices: 5.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**:\n    *   The group of characters mod 11 is $\\cong C_{10}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive.\n    *   Number of primitive characters: $\\phi(11)-1=9$.\n    *   Let $d_{11} = \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11})$. Possible orders are divisors of 10 (except 1): 2, 5, 10.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**:\n    *   The group of characters mod 13 is $\\cong C_{12}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive.\n    *   Number of primitive characters: $\\phi(13)-1=11$.\n    *   Let $d_{13} = \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})$. Possible orders are divisors of 12 (except 1): 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\n**4. Apply the total order condition**\n\nWe require the final character $\\chi$ to have order 6.\n$\\text{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}) = 6$.\n\nThis implies two conditions:\na) Each individual order $d_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\nb) The set of orders $\\{d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}\\}$ must contain at least one order that is a multiple of 2, and at least one order that is a multiple of 3.\n\n**5. Count the number of choices for each component**\n\nLet's count how many choices we have for each component character, subject to condition (a) that its order must divide 6.\n\n*   **$\\chi_4$**: The order is $d_4=2$, which divides 6. Number of choices = **1**.\n*   **$\\chi_9$**: The possible orders are $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. Both divide 6. We can choose any primitive character mod 9. Number of choices = 2 (order 3) + 2 (order 6) = **4**.\n*   **$\\chi_7$**: The possible orders are $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$. All divide 6. We can choose any primitive character mod 7. Number of choices = 1 (order 2) + 2 (order 3) + 2 (order 6) = **5**.\n*   **$\\chi_{11}$**: The possible orders are $d_{11} \\in \\{2, 5, 10\\}$. The only one that divides 6 is 2. Number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. Number of choices = **1**.\n*   **$\\chi_{13}$**: The possible orders are $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$. The orders that divide 6 are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. Number of choices = 1 (order 2) + 2 (order 3) + 2 (order 6) = **5**.\n\n**6. Verify the LCM and find the total count**\n\nNow we must check condition (b). For any combination of characters chosen according to the counts above:\n*   The order of the final character is $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$, where $o_i$ is the order of the chosen character for that component.\n*   Since all $o_i$ divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\n*   The order of $\\chi_4$ is $o_4=2$. Thus, the lcm is always divisible by 2.\n*   The order of $\\chi_9$ is $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. In either case, $o_9$ is divisible by 3. Thus, the lcm is always divisible by 3.\n*   An integer that is divisible by both 2 and 3 must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\n*   So, any character formed by combining one choice from each of our filtered sets will have an lcm that is divisible by 6. Since the lcm also divides 6, it must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, every combination of the allowed component characters results in a character of order 6. The total number is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal number = 100\n\nThere are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n\n<<<100>>>"
