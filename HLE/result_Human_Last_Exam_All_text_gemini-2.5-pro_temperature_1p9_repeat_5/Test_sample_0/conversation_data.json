    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core of the Question:** The question asks us to identify which of five specific ethical principles (conditions) from Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by \"critical-level views\" in population ethics. This requires understanding the theorem's conditions and the nature of critical-level views.\n\n2.  **Define Critical-Level Views:**\n    *   A critical-level view evaluates the goodness of a population based on the sum of individual welfares, where each individual's welfare is first adjusted by subtracting a \"critical level\" (`c`).\n    *   The formula is: **Value of a Population = Σ (w_i - c)**, where `w_i` is the welfare of person `i`.\n    *   A key feature is that for a person's life to be a positive addition to the world, their welfare (`w`) must be greater than the critical level (`c`). If their welfare is positive but less than `c` (`0 < w < c`), adding that person to the population is considered a bad thing (it lowers the total value).\n\n3.  **Define the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem:**\n    *   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** A very strong dominance principle. If population A and B have the same number of people, everyone in A is better off, and A is more equal, then A is better than B.\n    *   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** Quality can trump quantity. A certain number of people at a very high welfare level is better than *any* number of people at a very low (but positive) welfare level.\n    *   **C. Non-Elitism:** Quantity can trump quality. For any number of people with very high welfare, there is *some* number of people at a lower (but positive) welfare level whose existence would be better. It prevents an \"elitist\" view where lives below a certain quality are deemed incapable of outweighing high-quality lives, no matter their number.\n    *   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** An outcome with some people at positive welfare and none at negative welfare is better than an outcome with the same number of people all at negative welfare. This is a very basic condition.\n    *   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** It is sometimes good to add a person with a happy life. Specifically, there exists *some* positive welfare level `w` such that adding a person with that welfare is always an improvement.\n\n4.  **Analyze How Critical-Level Views Interact with Each Condition:**\n    Let's assume a standard critical-level view where the critical level `c` is positive (`c > 0`).\n\n    *   **Egalitarian Dominance:** Critical-level views satisfy this. If `w_Ai > w_Bi` for all `i` in two equal-sized populations, then `Σw_A > Σw_B`. It follows directly that `Σ(w_Ai - c) > Σ(w_Bi - c)`. Thus, A is better than B.\n    *   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** Critical-level views satisfy this. Consider a very high welfare level `w_high > c` and a very low positive welfare level `w_low < c`. The value of one person at `w_high` is `(w_high - c)`, which is positive. The value of any number (`m`) of people at `w_low` is `m * (w_low - c)`, which is negative. A positive value is always greater than a negative value. So, quality trumps quantity here.\n    *   **Non-Elitism:** Critical-level views **violate** this condition. Non-Elitism states that for any high-quality population, a sufficiently large low-quality population can be better. Let's test this.\n        *   Take a high-quality population: 1 person at a very high welfare level `w_high > c`. Its value is `w_high - c`, which is positive.\n        *   Now consider adding a large number of people (`m`) at a low positive welfare level `w_low`. If we pick this `w_low` to be between 0 and `c` (i.e., `0 < w_low < c`), then the contribution of each person is negative (`w_low - c < 0`).\n        *   The total value of this new population would be `m * (w_low - c)`, which is a large negative number. This can never be better than the single-person high-quality population with positive value.\n        *   Therefore, the critical-level view is \"elitist\" because it posits a threshold (`c`), and lives below this threshold (even if happy) cannot, through sheer numbers, outweigh lives above the threshold. This is a direct violation of Non-Elitism.\n    *   **Weak Non-Sadism:** Critical-level views satisfy this. A population with positive welfare (`w_i > 0`) will always have a higher sum of welfare than one of equal size with negative welfare (`w_j < 0`). Therefore, `Σw_i > Σw_j`, and `Σ(w_i - c) > Σ(w_j - c)`.\n    *   **Weak Quality Addition:** Critical-level views satisfy this. The condition only requires that there is *some* welfare level `w` that makes a good addition. For any critical level `c`, we can simply choose a welfare level `w` that is higher than `c` (e.g., `w = c + 1`). Adding a person at this level `w` increases the total value by `(w - c)`, which is positive.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that the only condition among the choices that critical-level views violate is **Non-Elitism**. This violation is a core and defining feature of such views.\n\n<<<C>>>"
