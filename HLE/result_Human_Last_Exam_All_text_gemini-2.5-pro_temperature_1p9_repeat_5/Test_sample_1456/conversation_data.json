    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** As stated in the question, a continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** This is a continuum that consists of more than one point. An interval `[0,1]` is a nondegenerate continuum, while a single point `{p}` is a degenerate continuum.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant containing `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `x` in `X` for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `x`. Composants partition the space `X`.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is called **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is **indecomposable**. (A subcontinuum is \"proper\" if it is not the entire space).\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Number of Composants to Decomposability**\n\nThere are two fundamental theorems in continuum theory that connect the concept of decomposability to the number of composants:\n\n1.  A continuum is **decomposable** if and only if it has exactly **one** composant. This single composant is the continuum itself.\n2.  A **nondegenerate indecomposable** metric continuum has exactly **c** composants, where `c` is the cardinality of the continuum (i.e., the number of real numbers, $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Decomposability of a Product Space**\n\nWe are interested in the product `P = X × Y`, where `X` and `Y` are two nondegenerate continua. Since `X` and `Y` are compact, connected, and metric, their product `P` is also a compact, connected, and metric space, i.e., `P` is also a continuum.\n\nTo find the number of composants of `P`, we first need to determine if `P` is decomposable or indecomposable. A crucial theorem by Kuratowski states:\n\n*   **Kuratowski's Theorem:** The product `X × Y` of two continua is **indecomposable** if and only if both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\nThis implies that `X × Y` is **decomposable** if at least one of the factors (`X` or `Y`) is decomposable.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Theorems to Find the Number of Composants of the Product**\n\nWe can now consider two distinct cases based on the properties of the factor spaces `X` and `Y`.\n\n*   **Case 1: At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.**\n    *   Let's assume `X` is a decomposable nondegenerate continuum. A simple example is the closed interval `[0,1]`, which is decomposable since `[0,1] = [0, 1/2] ∪ [1/2, 1]`.\n    *   According to Kuratowski's theorem, since `X` is decomposable, the product space `P = X × Y` is also decomposable, regardless of whether `Y` is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   Based on the theorem from Step 2, since `P` is a decomposable continuum, it must have exactly **1** composant.\n\n*   **Case 2: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.**\n    *   For this case to be possible, we must confirm that nondegenerate indecomposable continua exist. They do; famous examples include the **pseudo-arc**, the **dyadic solenoid**, and the **Knaster continuum** (buckethandle). These are all nondegenerate.\n    *   Let's choose `X` and `Y` to be two such nondegenerate indecomposable continua (e.g., let `X` and `Y` both be pseudo-arcs).\n    *   By Kuratowski's theorem, since both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable, their product `P = X × Y` is also an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   `P` is also nondegenerate. From the theorem in Step 2, since `P` is a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum, it has **c** composants.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Largest Possible Number**\n\nFrom the analysis of the two possible cases, the number of composants of the product `X × Y` can be either **1** or **c**. The question asks for the *largest possible* number.\n\nComparing the two possible values, `c` (an uncountable infinity) is vastly larger than 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The problem specifies **nondegenerate** continua. This is important because a single-point continuum is indecomposable but has only one composant, which would otherwise be a trivial exception to the rule for indecomposable continua. The nondegeneracy of `X` and `Y` ensures the product `X × Y` is also nondegenerate.\n*   The definition of a continuum includes being a **metric** space. This is crucial for applying Mazurkiewicz's theorem that nondegenerate indecomposable continua have `c` composants.\n*   The existence of nondegenerate indecomposable continua is a non-trivial fact of topology, but a standard one. Without such spaces, Case 2 would be impossible, and the answer would be 1.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe number of composants is determined by whether the product continuum `X × Y` is decomposable or indecomposable.\n*   If `X × Y` is decomposable, it has 1 composant. This happens if at least one factor is decomposable (e.g., `[0,1] × [0,1]`).\n*   If `X × Y` is indecomposable, it has `c` composants. This happens if both factors are indecomposable (e.g., pseudo-arc × pseudo-arc).\n\nSince both scenarios are possible for the product of two nondegenerate continua, the set of possible numbers of composants is `{1, c}`. The largest number in this set is `c`.\n\n<<<c>>>"
