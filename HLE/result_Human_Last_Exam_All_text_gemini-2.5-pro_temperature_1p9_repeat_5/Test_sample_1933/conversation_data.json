    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate is a property that an element of the universe can either have or not have. For example, if the universe is a set of people, a unary predicate could be `IsTall(x)`.\n\n2.  **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic. The formulas in this language are constructed using:\n    *   **Atoms**: $P_i(v)$, where $P_i$ is one of the predicates from $S$ and $v$ is a variable. Standardly, equality ($v=w$) is also an atomic formula in FO, and logical constants $\\top$ (True) and $\\bot$ (False) are included. The fragment explicitly lists $\\top$ and $\\bot$. We will consider the case with equality as it is standard; the result will not change if it is excluded.\n    *   **Connectives**: Only conjunction ($\\land$) is allowed. Disjunction ($\\lor$) and negation ($\\neg$) are not allowed.\n    *   **Quantifiers**: Only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$) is allowed. The universal quantifier ($\\forall$) is not allowed.\n\n3.  **VC Dimension**: In this context, we are looking at the VC dimension of a class of concepts defined by the logic.\n    *   **Universe and Structures**: We consider structures (or models) over the schema $S$. A structure $M$ has a universe (a set of elements) $U^M$ and defines the extension for each predicate, i.e., a set $P_i^M \\subseteq U^M$ of elements for which $P_i$ is true.\n    *   **Concepts**: The \"classifiers\" or \"concepts\" are defined by formulas $\\phi(x)$ with exactly one free variable, $x$. For a given structure $M$, a formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a subset of the universe: $C_\\phi^M = \\{a \\in U^M \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\n    *   **VC Dimension of the Logic**: The VC dimension of the logic fragment is the maximum VC dimension over all possible structures. That is, we seek the largest integer $d$ for which there exists a structure $M$ and a set of $d$ elements in its universe that can be \"shattered\" by the concepts definable in the logic.\n    *   **Shattering**: A set of points $X = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_d\\}$ is shattered by a class of concepts $\\mathcal{C}$ if for every possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $C \\cap X = Y$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Formulas\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to understand what kind of subsets can be defined by the formulas in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. Let $\\phi(x)$ be a formula with one free variable $x$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of $\\phi(x)$ inductively:\n*   **Atomic formulas**: The only atomic formulas with just one free variable $x$ are $P_i(x)$ (for $i=1,2,3,4$) or $x=x$ (which is $\\top$).\n*   **Conjunction**: If we have $\\phi_1(x) \\land \\phi_2(x)$, and we know the sets they define, the resulting set is the intersection of these sets.\n*   **Existential Quantification**: Consider a formula $\\phi(x) = \\exists y (\\psi(x,y))$. Because the schema $S$ only has unary predicates and the logic lacks negation, there is no way to enforce complex relationships between $x$ and $y$. The only standard way to relate variables is equality, e.g., using an atom like $x=y$.\n\nLet's prove that any formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic is equivalent to a formula of the form $(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)) \\land \\theta$, where $I$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and $\\theta$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\n\n*   **Base case**: An atomic formula $P_i(x)$ is already in this form (with $\\theta=\\top$).\n*   **Inductive step (Conjunction)**: Let $\\phi(x) = \\phi_1(x) \\land \\phi_2(x)$. By induction hypothesis, $\\phi_1(x) \\equiv \\psi_1(x) \\land \\theta_1$ and $\\phi_2(x) \\equiv \\psi_2(x) \\land \\theta_2$. Then $\\phi(x) \\equiv (\\psi_1(x) \\land \\psi_2(x)) \\land (\\theta_1 \\land \\theta_2)$. The conjunction of two conjunctions of atomic predicates is another conjunction of atomic predicates. The conjunction of two sentences is another sentence. The form is preserved.\n*   **Inductive step (Quantification)**: Let $\\phi(x) = \\exists y (\\alpha(x,y))$. By induction hypothesis, $\\alpha(x,y)$ is equivalent to a conjunction of atomic formulas on $\\{x, y\\}$ and a sentence. The atoms can be separated into those involving only $x$, those only involving $y$, and the equality $x=y$.\n    So, $\\alpha(x,y) \\equiv A(x) \\land B(y) \\land (x=y \\text{ or } \\top) \\land \\theta_s$.\n    1.  If the atom $x=y$ is not present (or can be replaced by $\\top$), then $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y (A(x) \\land B(y) \\land \\theta_s) \\equiv A(x) \\land \\exists y(B(y) \\land \\theta_s)$. The part $\\exists y(B(y) \\land \\theta_s)$ is a sentence. So the formula is equivalent to $A(x) \\land \\theta'$, which has the desired form.\n    2.  If the atom $x=y$ is present, then $\\exists y (\\dots \\land x=y \\land \\dots)$ implies we can substitute $x$ for $y$ inside the quantifier. The formula becomes equivalent to $A(x) \\land B(x) \\land \\theta_s$. This is again a conjunction of atomic predicates on $x$ and a sentence.\n\nThis analysis shows that for any formula $\\phi(x)$ in the logic, it defines a set that is either $\\emptyset$ (if the sentence part $\\theta$ is false in the model $M$) or an intersection of the base sets $P_i^M$ (if the sentence part $\\theta$ is true in $M$).\n\nSo, for any model $M$, the class of definable concepts $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is a subset of the family of sets given by $\\{\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\}$, along with the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the VC Dimension\n\nWe now need to find the VC dimension of the concept class formed by intersections of 4 sets. This is a standard result in computational learning theory.\n\n**The VC dimension of a concept class consisting of all intersections of $k$ base sets is exactly $k$.**\n\nIn our case, the base sets are the extensions of the 4 unary predicates, so $k=4$. This means that for any model $M$, the VC dimension of the definable concepts is at most 4. Therefore, the VC dimension of the logic is at most 4.\n\nTo show the VC dimension is exactly 4, we need to show that it is at least 4. This requires us to construct a specific model $M$ and a set of 4 elements $X$ within its universe that can be shattered.\n\n**Construction for Shattering 4 Points:**\n*   Let the universe be $U = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We want to shatter this set $X=U$.\n*   Define the extensions of the 4 predicates as follows:\n    *   $P_1^M = U \\setminus \\{x_1\\} = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n    *   $P_2^M = U \\setminus \\{x_2\\} = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n    *   $P_3^M = U \\setminus \\{x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n    *   $P_4^M = U \\setminus \\{x_4\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n*   Now, we must show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a formula $\\phi(z)$ in our logic such that the set it defines is exactly $Y$.\n*   Let $Y$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$. Construct the formula $\\phi_Y(z)$ as follows:\n    $\\phi_Y(z) := \\bigwedge_{i \\text{ such that } x_i \\notin Y} P_i(z)$\n    This formula is a conjunction of atomic predicates, so it is in our logic fragment.\n*   Let's check what set this formula defines in our model $M$. An element $a \\in X$ satisfies $\\phi_Y(z)$ if and only if $a \\in P_i^M$ for all $i$ such that $x_i \\notin Y$.\n    *   $a \\in P_i^M$ means $a \\neq x_i$.\n    *   So, $a$ satisfies $\\phi_Y(z)$ if and only if for all $i$ such that $x_i \\notin Y$, we have $a \\neq x_i$.\n    *   This is equivalent to saying that $a$ is not in the set $\\{x_i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\} = X \\setminus Y$.\n    *   If $a \\notin X \\setminus Y$, then $a \\in Y$.\n    *   Thus, the formula $\\phi_Y(z)$ defines exactly the set $Y$.\n\nSince we can define every subset of the 4-element set $X$, we have successfully shattered $X$. This proves that the VC dimension of the logic is at least 4.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown two things:\n1.  The VC dimension is at most 4 because any definable set is an intersection of the 4 base predicate extensions.\n2.  The VC dimension is at least 4 because we can construct a model where a set of 4 elements is shattered.\n\nCombining these two facts, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
