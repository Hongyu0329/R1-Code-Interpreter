    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Triple Crown\nThe Triple Crown in Major League Baseball refers to a batting achievement where a player leads their specific league (either the American League or National League) in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: List All Triple Crown Winning Seasons\nTo find the number of winners, we must first identify every instance a player has won the Triple Crown. We will list them chronologically by league.\n\n**National League (NL) Winners (and Predecessors)**\n\n*   **1878 - Paul Hines** (Providence Grays)\n*   **1887 - Tip O'Neill** (St. Louis Browns, in the American Association, a recognized major league)\n*   **1894 - Hugh Duffy** (Boston Beaneaters)\n*   **1922 - Rogers Hornsby** (St. Louis Cardinals)\n*   **1925 - Rogers Hornsby** (St. Louis Cardinals)\n*   **1933 - Chuck Klein** (Philadelphia Phillies)\n*   **1937 - Joe Medwick** (St. Louis Cardinals)\n\n**American League (AL) Winners**\n\n*   **1901 - Nap Lajoie** (Philadelphia Athletics)\n*   **1909 - Ty Cobb** (Detroit Tigers)\n*   **1933 - Jimmie Foxx** (Philadelphia Athletics)\n*   **1934 - Lou Gehrig** (New York Yankees)\n*   **1942 - Ted Williams** (Boston Red Sox)\n*   **1947 - Ted Williams** (Boston Red Sox)\n*   **1956 - Mickey Mantle** (New York Yankees)\n*   **1966 - Frank Robinson** (Baltimore Orioles)\n*   **1967 - Carl Yastrzemski** (Boston Red Sox)\n*   **2012 - Miguel Cabrera** (Detroit Tigers)\n\n### Step 3: Identify Careful Points and Nuances\n\n*   **Multiple Winners:** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" not the number of times the Triple Crown has been won. We must count each player only once.\n    *   **Rogers Hornsby** won it twice (1922, 1925).\n    *   **Ted Williams** won it twice (1942, 1947).\n*   **Total Wins vs. Total Winners:** There have been a total of **17** Triple Crowns won in MLB history (7 in the NL/AA and 10 in the AL). However, since two players won it twice, the number of unique winners will be lower.\n*   **Most Recent Winner:** Miguel Cabrera's 2012 achievement was highly notable as it was the first time a player had won the Triple Crown in 45 years.\n*   **Dual Winners in One Year:** In 1933, both the National League (Chuck Klein) and American League (Jimmie Foxx) had a Triple Crown winner.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Number of Winners\nNow we will count the unique players from the list compiled in Step 2.\n\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Rogers Hornsby (counts as one winner)\n5.  Chuck Klein\n6.  Joe Medwick\n7.  Nap Lajoie\n8.  Ty Cobb\n9.  Jimmie Foxx\n10. Lou Gehrig\n11. Ted Williams (counts as one winner)\n12. Mickey Mantle\n13. Frank Robinson\n14. Carl Yastrzemski\n15. Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting these unique individuals, we arrive at the final number.\n\n<<<15>>>"
