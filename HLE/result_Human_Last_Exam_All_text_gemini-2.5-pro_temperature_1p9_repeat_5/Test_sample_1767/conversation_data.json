    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Question**\n\n*   **System:** We have two distinct 2D materials, each being a Chern insulator.\n*   **Property of each material:** Both materials have a Chern number ($C$) of 1.\n*   **Connection:** They are connected \"laterally\" (side-by-side).\n*   **Interaction:** There is a \"negligible tunneling barrier\" between them.\n*   **Question:** What is the Chern number of the combined system (the junction)?\n\n**2. Define the Chern Number and its Physical Significance**\n\n*   The Chern number ($C$) is an integer topological invariant that characterizes the electronic band structure of a 2D material in a magnetic field or with intrinsic magnetic order.\n*   **Physical Meaning 1 (Bulk Property):** It determines the quantized Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy}$) of the material, according to the formula: $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   **Physical Meaning 2 (Boundary Property):** The bulk-boundary correspondence principle states that the absolute value of the Chern number, $|C|$, is equal to the number of protected, one-dimensional chiral edge states that exist at the boundary between the material and a topologically trivial one (like a vacuum, which has $C=0$). The sign of $C$ determines the direction (chirality) of propagation of these edge states.\n\n**3. Analyze the Key Condition: \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\"**\n\n*   This phrase is crucial. It means the electrons can move freely between the two materials at the interface.\n*   The two Chern insulators are not just weakly interacting; they effectively merge to form a **single, larger topological system**. The boundary between them is no longer a \"hard\" edge like the boundary with a vacuum.\n\n**4. Approach 1: Additivity of the Hall Conductance**\n\n*   This is the most direct way to solve the problem.\n*   The Hall conductance is an extensive property. When two conductors are placed in parallel (which is what a lateral connection is), their total conductance is the sum of their individual conductances.\n*   Let the two insulators be System 1 and System 2.\n    *   Hall conductance of System 1: $\\sigma_{xy,1} = C_1 \\frac{e^2}{h} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n    *   Hall conductance of System 2: $\\sigma_{xy,2} = C_2 \\frac{e^2}{h} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n*   The total Hall conductance of the combined system is the sum:\n    *   $\\sigma_{xy,total} = \\sigma_{xy,1} + \\sigma_{xy,2} = \\left(1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}\\right) + \\left(1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}\\right) = 2 \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n*   The Chern number of the total system ($C_{total}$) is defined by its total Hall conductance:\n    *   $\\sigma_{xy,total} = C_{total} \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n*   By comparing the two expressions for $\\sigma_{xy,total}$, we can directly conclude:\n    *   $C_{total} = 2$\n\n**5. Approach 2: Analysis using Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**\n\n*   This approach provides a physical picture that confirms the result from the additivity principle.\n*   The number of chiral edge states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers $C_A$ and $C_B$ is given by the difference: $N_{states} = C_A - C_B$.\n*   Let's analyze the two types of interfaces in our combined system:\n\n    *   **Internal Interface (The junction between the two insulators):**\n        *   Here, we have Region A with $C_A=1$ and Region B with $C_B=1$.\n        *   The number of edge states at this interface is $N_{internal} = C_A - C_B = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n        *   **Interpretation:** This means there are **no** protected edge states at the boundary between the two materials. The edge states that originally existed on these individual boundaries (before joining) will hybridize and \"gap out\", disappearing into the bulk spectrum. The interface is now topologically trivial, just like the bulk of either material.\n\n    *   **External Interface (The boundary with the outside vacuum):**\n        *   The combined system has a total Chern number $C_{total}$. It is surrounded by vacuum, which has $C_{vac}=0$.\n        *   The number of edge states at this outer boundary is $N_{external} = C_{total} - C_{vac} = C_{total} - 0 = C_{total}$.\n        *   Before joining, each C=1 insulator had one chiral edge state circulating its perimeter. When they are joined laterally, the parts of the perimeter that form the internal junction lose their edge states. The remaining parts of the perimeters merge to form a new, larger outer boundary. The original two outer edge states now co-exist and co-propagate along this new boundary.\n        *   This results in a total of two parallel, co-propagating edge channels circulating around the entire combined system.\n        *   Since the number of edge states is 2, the total Chern number of the junction must be 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth methods of analysis lead to the same conclusion. The Chern number is an additive quantity for systems combined in this manner. The total Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n$C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
