    "To determine the number of red and blue pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we will follow a step-by-step analysis based on the standard construction of dyadic rational numbers in this game.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Representation of Numbers in Red-Blue Hackenbush**\n\nThe value of a Red-Blue Hackenbush position is the surreal number associated with the game tree. A key property is that the value of a position consisting of several disconnected \"stalks\" (or components) growing from the ground is the sum of the values of the individual stalks.\n\nThis property allows us to represent any dyadic rational (a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator) by expressing it as a sum of powers of 2 and then constructing a game for each term.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Number as a Sum of Powers of 2**\n\nWe need to write $\\frac{13}{16}$ in its binary expansion.\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8 + 4 + 1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} $$\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} $$\nIn binary notation, this is $0.1101_2$.\n\nThis means the Hackenbush position for $\\frac{13}{16}$ can be constructed as the sum of three separate game positions (stalks), with values $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$ respectively.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and Piece Count for a Stalk of Value $\\frac{1}{2^k}$**\n\nWe need to find the canonical representation for a stalk with the value $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ for $k > 0$. The surreal number $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ is defined by the form `{L|R}`, where L is a set of numbers smaller than it, and R is a set of numbers larger than it. The simplest such form is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2^k} = \\{0 \\mid 1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}\\} $$\nThis can be constructed in Hackenbush as follows:\n*   **Left's Move (to get 0):** There must be a single red edge at the base of the stalk. If the Left player cuts this edge, the entire stalk is disconnected from the ground, resulting in the empty game, which has a value of 0.\n*   **Right's Moves (to get $1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}$):** Stacked on top of the red edge are `k` blue edges. Let's call them $B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k$ from bottom to top.\n    *   If the Right player cuts the lowest blue edge ($B_1$), only the single red edge remains, which has a value of 1.\n    *   If Right cuts the next blue edge ($B_2$), what remains is the red edge with one blue edge on top ($B_1$-on-Red). This structure represents the game $\\{0|1\\} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    *   In general, if Right cuts the $i$-th blue edge from the bottom ($B_i$), the remaining structure is a red edge with $i-1$ blue edges on top. This structure has the value $\\frac{1}{2^{i-1}}$.\n*   **Piece Count:** This structure for $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ consists of **1 red edge** and **k blue edges**. Therefore, the total number of pieces is $k+1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Pieces for Each Stalk**\n\nNow we apply the formula from Step 3 to each term in our sum for $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n\n1.  **Stalk for $\\frac{1}{2}$:** Here, $k=1$.\n    *   Pieces = $k+1 = 1+1 = 2$ pieces (1 red, 1 blue).\n2.  **Stalk for $\\frac{1}{4}$:** Here, $k=2$.\n    *   Pieces = $k+1 = 2+1 = 3$ pieces (1 red, 2 blue).\n3.  **Stalk for $\\frac{1}{16}$:** Here, $k=4$.\n    *   Pieces = $k+1 = 4+1 = 5$ pieces (1 red, 4 blue).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Pieces**\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is the sum of the pieces for each individual stalk.\nTotal Pieces = (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{2}$) + (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{4}$) + (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{16}$)\nTotal Pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\nTo be specific about the colors:\n*   Total Red Pieces = 1 (from 1/2) + 1 (from 1/4) + 1 (from 1/16) = 3 red pieces.\n*   Total Blue Pieces = 1 (from 1/2) + 2 (from 1/4) + 4 (from 1/16) = 7 blue pieces.\nThe total number of pieces, either red or blue, is $3 + 7 = 10$."
