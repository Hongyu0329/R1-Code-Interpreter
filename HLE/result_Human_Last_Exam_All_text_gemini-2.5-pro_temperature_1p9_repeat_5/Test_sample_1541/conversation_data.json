    "### Problem Analysis\n\nThe problem asks us to take a string representing a sum of numbers (only 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s) and rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order. For example, the input `3+2+1+4+1+2` should be transformed into `1+1+2+2+3+4`. We need to design the most memory-efficient C program to solve this and calculate the total memory `m` (in bytes) used by the variables in this program.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Constraints and Optimizations**\n*   **Input:** A string like `1+3+2+1` with a maximum length of 1000 characters.\n*   **Numbers:** The numbers in the sum are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is a very important constraint.\n*   **Goal:** Sort the numbers and print them back in the sum format.\n*   **Efficiency Goal:** The primary objective is to minimize the memory used by variables.\n\nThe small and fixed range of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) strongly suggests that a standard sorting algorithm like Quicksort is unnecessary and inefficient. A counting sort approach would be much better, both in terms of time and memory for the core logic.\n\n**Step 2: Devising a Memory-Efficient Algorithm**\n\nTo minimize memory, we should avoid storing the entire input string if possible. Storing a string of 1000 characters would require a `char` array of size 1001 (for the null terminator), which is already over 1 KB. We can achieve better memory efficiency by processing the input character by character.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is as follows:\n1.  **Counting Phase:** Read the input string one character at a time. We only care about the digits. Skip the `+` characters. For each digit encountered, increment a counter corresponding to that digit. For example, if we read a '2', we increment a `count_of_2s` variable.\n2.  **Printing Phase:** After counting all the numbers, print the result. First, print all the '1's (the number of times specified by its counter), then all the '2's, and so on, up to '4's. A `+` sign must be printed between each number, but not at the end.\n\n**Step 3: Implementing the Algorithm with Minimal Variables**\n\nLet's identify the exact variables needed for a C implementation based on the algorithm above.\n\n1.  **Counters for Numbers:** We need to count the occurrences of 1, 2, 3, and 4. We can use a small integer array for this.\n    *   `int counts[4];` This array will store the counts, where `counts[0]` is for the number 1, `counts[1]` for 2, `counts[2]` for 3, and `counts[3]` for 4.\n    *   Memory used: `4 * sizeof(int)`. Assuming a standard 32-bit system where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, this is `4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n\n2.  **Variable for Reading Input:** To read character by character without a large buffer, we can use the `getchar()` function. It returns an `int`, so we need an `int` variable to store its result.\n    *   `int c;`\n    *   Memory used: `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n3.  **Variable for Controlling `+` Printing:** We need to print `+` between numbers but not after the last one. A common way is to use a flag. However, a more memory-efficient way that integrates with our algorithm is to count the total number of summands first.\n    *   `int total_numbers;` We can increment this counter during the input phase. When printing, we print a number, decrement the counter, and if the counter is still greater than 0, we print a `+`.\n    *   Memory used: `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n4.  **Loop Counter:** We need a loop counter for the printing phase to iterate through our `counts` array (from 1 to 4).\n    *   `int i;`\n    *   Memory used: `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\nThe inner loop for printing multiple copies of the same number (e.g., printing '1' `counts[0]` times) can be done by decrementing the value in the `counts` array itself, avoiding the need for another loop counter variable like `j`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Choice of Algorithm:** Using a counting sort instead of a general-purpose sort is the most critical decision for efficiency.\n2.  **Input Reading:** Processing input with `getchar()` instead of reading the whole line into a buffer (e.g., with `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` or `fgets`) is key to minimizing memory.\n3.  **Output Formatting:** The logic for printing the `+` signs must be correct. Using a total number counter is an elegant and efficient method that avoids extra flag variables or complex conditional checks in the loop.\n4.  **Data Types and Sizes:** We assume `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, which is standard on most competitive programming platforms (32-bit or 64-bit systems).\n5.  **Variable Reuse:** We minimize the number of variables. For instance, the loop for printing can decrement the `counts` and `total_numbers` variables directly, avoiding extra state variables.\n\n### Final Memory Calculation\n\nLet's sum the memory usage of all the variables identified for the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n*   `int counts[4];` -> 16 bytes\n*   `int total_numbers;` -> 4 bytes\n*   `int c;` -> 4 bytes\n*   `int i;` -> 4 bytes\n\n**Total memory `m` = 16 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 bytes.**\n\n<<<28>>>"
