    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the question to ensure a clear understanding of what is being asked.\n\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** We are working with a graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices `|V|` is exactly 128.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the subset are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `V' ⊂ V`, the induced subgraph `G[V']` has `V'` as its vertex set and contains all edges from `E` that have both endpoints in `V'`.\n*   **Clique as an induced subgraph:** We are looking for subsets of vertices `V'` of size `k` such that the induced subgraph `G[V']` is a `K_k`. This means that within the subset `V'`, every pair of vertices is connected.\n*   **Different clique sizes:** The goal is to count how many distinct values of `k` (e.g., k=3, k=5, k=10) can be found as sizes of induced cliques. We are interested in the number of these different sizes, not the total count of all cliques in the graph.\n*   **Simultaneously appear:** All these different-sized cliques must exist as induced subgraphs within a *single* graph `G`.\n*   **Maximize the number of different sizes:** We need to find the absolute maximum this count can be, across all possible graphs on 128 vertices.\n\nLet `S(G)` be the set of all integers `k` for which `G` contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`. The question asks for the value of `max_{G: |V|=128} |S(G)|`.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound\n\nLet `G` be any graph with `n=128` vertices.\nIf we want to find an induced clique of size `k`, we must select `k` vertices from `G`. This is only possible if the graph has at least `k` vertices.\nSince our graph `G` has `n=128` vertices, the size `k` of any clique cannot exceed 128.\nSo, any possible clique size `k` must be an integer satisfying `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\nThe set of all possible clique sizes is a subset of `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\nTherefore, the number of *different* clique sizes, `|S(G)|`, can be at most 128.\nThis establishes a firm upper bound: **Maximum Possible Number ≤ 128**.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a Graph to Achieve the Upper Bound\n\nNow, we need to determine if this upper bound of 128 is achievable. To do this, we must construct a specific graph `G*` on 128 vertices that contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, `G* = K_{128}`.\nIn a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's verify if this graph `K_{128}` has the required properties:\n1.  **It has n=128 vertices:** Yes, by definition.\n2.  **It has induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128:** Let's pick any integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\n    *   To find an induced clique of size `k`, we need to find a subset of `k` vertices whose induced subgraph is `K_k`.\n    *   Let's select *any* subset of `k` vertices from `V(K_{128})`. Let's call this subset `V'`.\n    *   The induced subgraph `K_{128}[V']` consists of the vertices in `V'` and all edges from the original graph `K_{128}` that connect two vertices in `V'`.\n    *   Since the original graph is a `K_{128}`, every pair of vertices in it is connected. This is true for all vertices, so it must also be true for the vertices in our chosen subset `V'`.\n    *   Therefore, the induced subgraph `K_{128}[V']` is a complete graph on `k` vertices. In other words, it is `K_k`.\n\nSince we can do this for any `k` from 1 to 128, the graph `K_{128}` contains induced cliques of sizes `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\nFor this graph `K_{128}`, the set of different clique sizes `S(K_{128})` is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\nThe number of different clique sizes is `|S(K_{128})| = 128`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have established two key points:\n1.  The maximum possible number of different clique sizes cannot be more than 128.\n2.  We have found a specific graph, `K_{128}`, that achieves exactly 128 different clique sizes.\n\nCombining these two points, we can conclude that the maximum possible number is indeed 128.\n\nA point of carefulness is to not confuse this with other, less efficient constructions. For example, a graph consisting of the disjoint union of cliques `K_1, K_2, ..., K_m` requires `1 + 2 + ... + m = m(m+1)/2` vertices. For `n=128`, this method would only yield 15 different clique sizes (`15*16/2 = 120 <= 128`). The key insight is that larger cliques contain smaller cliques as induced subgraphs, making the complete graph the most efficient construction for this specific problem.\n\n<<<128>>>"
