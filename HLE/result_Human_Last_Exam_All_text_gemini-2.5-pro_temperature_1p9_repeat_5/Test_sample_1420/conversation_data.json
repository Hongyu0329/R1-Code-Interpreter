    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System and Theoretical Framework:**\n    *   **Question:** We need to find the specific heat scaling exponent, $\\alpha$.\n    *   **Context:** The theoretical framework is the Renormalization Group (RG) theory.\n    *   **Method:** The specific method required is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion.\n    *   **System:** The spatial dimension is given as $d=3$. When the type of system is not specified in such problems, it is standard to assume the simplest and most fundamental universality class, which is the **Ising model**. The Ising model has an order parameter with a single component ($n=1$).\n\n2.  **Understand the Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion:**\n    *   The $\\epsilon$-expansion, developed by Wilson and Fisher, is a powerful perturbative technique in RG theory. It works by performing calculations in a dimension $d$ that is slightly below the *upper critical dimension*, $d_c$.\n    *   The upper critical dimension, $d_c$, is the dimension above which the critical behavior of the system is correctly described by mean-field theory. For the Ising universality class (and the O(n) models in general), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n    *   The expansion parameter is defined as $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. All physical quantities, like critical exponents, are calculated as a power series in $\\epsilon$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expansion Parameter $\\epsilon$:**\n    *   We have the upper critical dimension $d_c = 4$.\n    *   The physical dimension of the system is $d=3$.\n    *   Therefore, the value of $\\epsilon$ for our case is:\n        $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The expansion is technically valid for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Applying it for $\\epsilon = 1$ is an extrapolation. However, this is the standard procedure for using the $\\epsilon$-expansion to estimate exponents for 3-dimensional systems, and it yields surprisingly reasonable results.\n\n4.  **Find the General Formula for the Exponent $\\alpha$:**\n    *   Within the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the general O(n) vector model, the critical exponent $\\alpha$ can be derived from the hyperscaling relation $d\\nu = 2-\\alpha$ and the result for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$.\n    *   To the first order in $\\epsilon$, the exponent $\\nu$ is given by:\n        $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   Substituting this into the hyperscaling relation $2-\\alpha = d\\nu = (4-\\epsilon)\\nu$:\n        $2 - \\alpha = (4-\\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon \\right) + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n        $2 - \\alpha = 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n        $-\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n        $-\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - (n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n        $-\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{2n+4 - n-8}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n        $-\\alpha = \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   Therefore, the general formula for $\\alpha$ to leading order in $\\epsilon$ is:\n        $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the correct leading-order formula for the exponent. Different exponents have different dependencies on $n$ and $\\epsilon$.\n\n5.  **Specialize for the Ising Model:**\n    *   As established in Step 1, we use the Ising model, which corresponds to $n=1$.\n    *   Substituting $n=1$ into the general formula for $\\alpha$:\n        $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   We now substitute the value $\\epsilon=1$ (from Step 3) into the formula for the Ising model's exponent $\\alpha$.\n    *   $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n    *   This is the value for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ for a 3-dimensional system in the Ising universality class, as calculated to the first order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Assume Ising Model:** In the absence of specific information, assuming the Ising model ($n=1$) is the standard approach.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension:** Correctly identifying $d_c=4$ for this class of models is fundamental.\n*   **Extrapolation:** The use of $\\epsilon=1$ is an extrapolation of a result derived for small $\\epsilon$. The question asks for the result *from* this method, not the experimentally exact value.\n*   **Correct Formula:** Ensure the correct first-order formula for the specific exponent $\\alpha$ is used, which is $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis yields the final answer.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
