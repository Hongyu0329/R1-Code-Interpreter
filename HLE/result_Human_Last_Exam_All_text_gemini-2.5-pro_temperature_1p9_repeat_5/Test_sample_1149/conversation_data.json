    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the anatomical feature in question.**\nThe question asks about the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri*.\n*   ***Irritator challengeri***: A species of spinosaurid dinosaur known from a nearly complete skull found in Brazil.\n*   **Lacrimal bone**: A bone in the skull that sits in front of the orbit (eye socket) and behind the naris (nostril).\n*   **Lacrimal recess**: A specific depression or fossa located on the lacrimal bone. The question asks for the number of smaller depressions *within* this main recess.\n\n**Step 2: Consult the primary scientific description.**\nThe most accurate information will come from the detailed scientific papers describing the holotype skull of *Irritator* (specimen SMNS 58022). The key scientific paper for this level of detail is \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, published in the *Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology* in 2002.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the specific description in the paper.**\nIn the descriptive anatomy section of Sues et al. (2002), the authors describe the lacrimal bone. On page 539, they detail the features of the lacrimal recess, which is the deepest part of the larger antorbital fossa on the lacrimal bone.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the description and count the features.**\nThe paper states the following about the lacrimal recess:\n\"...its deepest portion, the lacrimal recess, houses **two** large, subcircular fenestrae of which the anterior one is considerably larger than the posterior one. Both fenestrae appear to represent pneumatopores, and a small, distinct **third** pneumatopore is located immediately posterior to them within the lacrimal recess.\"\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The terms \"fenestrae\" (windows or openings) and \"pneumatopore\" (openings related to air sacs) both refer to types of depressions or holes in the bone.\n*   The question uses the general term \"depressions,\" which correctly encompasses these specific anatomical features.\n*   The text explicitly counts the features for us: two larger fenestrae/pneumatopores and a distinct third, smaller pneumatopore.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final count.**\nBased on the direct description in the scientific literature, we can sum the features mentioned:\n1.  One large anterior fenestra (a depression).\n2.  One smaller posterior fenestra (a depression).\n3.  One small third pneumatopore (a depression).\n\nTotaling these gives a count of 3 depressions within the lacrimal recess.\n\n<<<3>>>"
