    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figures and Context:** The question focuses on Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his military campaigns in Vietnam. The specific context is the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), led by Lê Lợi, which sought to end the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination).\n\n2.  **Search for Mu Sheng's Engagements:** Mu Sheng was one of the primary Ming commanders tasked with suppressing the Lam Sơn rebellion. We need to look for his specific battles against Lê Lợi's forces and identify which one was his first significant loss.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the First Major Defeat:** While there were many skirmishes, Mu Sheng's first *major* defeat occurred in late 1424 or early 1425. This happened after a critical strategic shift by Lê Lợi. On the advice of his general Nguyễn Chích, Lê Lợi moved his base of operations from the mountains of Thanh Hóa south into the more populous and less defended region of Nghệ An.\n\n4.  **Identify the Specific Battle:** In response to Lê Lợi's success in Nghệ An, the Ming court ordered Mu Sheng to lead a relief army from Yunnan to crush the rebellion. Lê Lợi anticipated this move and prepared a series of ambushes. The resulting engagement is known as the **Battle of Khả Lưu - Bồ Ải**.\n    *   First, the Ming vanguard was ambushed and defeated at Khả Lưu Pass.\n    *   Then, Mu Sheng's main army was decisively crushed in a larger ambush set by Lê Lợi at Bồ Ải Pass (also spelled Bồ Lạp).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Significance of the Battle:** This defeat was catastrophic for the Ming forces. Mu Sheng lost thousands of men and was forced to retreat into the citadel of Nghệ An, ceding the strategic initiative to Lê Lợi. This victory was a major turning point in the war, allowing the Lam Sơn army to consolidate control over Nghệ An and use it as a springboard to liberate the rest of the country. It is widely considered Mu Sheng's first major defeat in the campaign against Lê Lợi.\n\n6.  **Locate the Battle Site on a Modern Map:** The historical sites of Khả Lưu Pass (đèo Khả Lưu) and Bồ Ải Pass (đèo Bồ Ải) are located in the western, mountainous region of a specific Vietnamese province. Historical records place both these locations firmly within the territory of what is today **Nghệ An Province**. Specifically, Khả Lưu is situated in the modern Anh Sơn District of Nghệ An.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **\"First Major Defeat\":** It's important to distinguish this from minor skirmishes or other generals' defeats. The Battle of Khả Lưu - Bồ Ải was the first time a large army under Mu Sheng's personal command was routed by Lê Lợi's forces, marking a significant strategic failure.\n*   **Mu Sheng's Later Campaign:** Mu Sheng was involved in a later campaign in 1427, but his fellow commander Liu Sheng's army was destroyed at Chi Lăng before Mu Sheng could engage. Upon hearing of this disaster, Mu Sheng retreated. While a strategic failure, the 1425 battle was his first direct, major defeat on the battlefield.\n*   **Geographical Naming:** Historical place names can be spelled differently or refer to locations that have since been renamed. Cross-referencing historical maps and descriptions with modern geography confirms the location as Nghệ An.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the location of Mu Sheng's first major defeat is Nghệ An Province.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
