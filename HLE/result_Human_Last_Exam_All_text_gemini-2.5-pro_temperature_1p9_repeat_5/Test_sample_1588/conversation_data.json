    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z$ such that $e^Z = e^X e^Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting elements of a Lie algebra. The formula for $Z$ is an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$:\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [X, Y]] + \\dots$\n\nThe \"order\" of a term corresponds to the total number of $X$'s and $Y$'s in it. For example, $[X,[X,Y]]$ is a term of order 3.\n\n**Step 2: Relate BCH Terms to the Free Lie Algebra**\n\nThe terms of order $n$ in the BCH expansion are linear combinations of nested commutators containing $n$ variables (each being $X$ or $Y$). These commutators form a basis for a vector space, which is the $n$-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra generated by $X$ and $Y$, denoted as $\\mathcal{L}(X, Y)_n$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent commutators of order $n$ is therefore the dimension of this vector space, $\\dim(\\mathcal{L}(X, Y)_n)$.\n\n**Step 3: The Crucial Property of BCH Coefficients**\n\nA fundamental and non-trivial theorem in the study of the BCH formula states that when the series is expressed in terms of a basis for the free Lie algebra (such as a Hall basis or Lyndon basis), every basis element of every order $n \\ge 1$ has a **non-zero** coefficient.\n\nThis means that to find the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10, we simply need to find the number of linearly independent basis elements of order 10. In other words, we need to calculate the dimension of the vector space $\\mathcal{L}(X, Y)_{10}$.\n\n**Step 4: Use Witt's Formula to Calculate the Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the $n$-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n$L_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the order (or degree).\n*   $k$ is the number of generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\nIn our case, we are looking for coefficients of order $n=10$, and the expansion involves two generators, $X$ and $Y$, so $k=2$.\n\nThe formula becomes:\n$L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Calculation**\n\n1.  **Find the divisors of n=10**:\n    The positive divisors of 10 are $d = \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor**:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$ (by definition).\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a single prime factor).\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a single prime factor).\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\times 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is square-free with 2 distinct prime factors).\n\n3.  **Calculate each term in the sum $\\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$**:\n    *   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = (1) \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n    *   For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} = -32$\n    *   For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} = -4$\n    *   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = (1) \\cdot 2^{1} = 2$\n\n4.  **Compute the sum**:\n    Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$\n\n5.  **Divide by n=10 to get the final answer**:\n    $L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Order vs. Number of Commutators**: The order $n$ refers to the total number of generators ($X$'s and $Y$'s), not the number of commutator brackets. A term of order $n$ is formed from $n-1$ nested brackets.\n*   **Non-Zero Coefficients**: The key to solving this problem without having to compute the actual coefficients is knowing the theorem that all basis elements of the free Lie algebra have non-zero coefficients in the BCH expansion. If this were not true, the problem would be much harder.\n*   **Möbius Function Calculation**: Be careful when calculating the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$. It is 0 if $d$ is divisible by a square of a prime, but this doesn't happen for the divisors of 10. It is $(-1)^p$ if $d$ is a product of $p$ distinct primes, and 1 for $d=1$.\n*   **Integer Result**: The dimension of a vector space must be a non-negative integer. If your calculation with Witt's formula doesn't produce an integer, you have made a mistake.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the 10th-degree component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, which is calculated to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
