    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$):** This is a group whose elements are equivalence classes of 3-dimensional integral homology spheres. Two such manifolds, $M_1$ and $M_2$, are considered equivalent (or homology cobordant) if there exists a 4-dimensional manifold $W$ whose boundary is $M_1 \\sqcup -M_2$ (the disjoint union of $M_1$ and $M_2$ with opposite orientation) and whose homology is the same as that of $M_1$ (and $M_2$). The group operation is connected sum (#), and the identity element is the class of the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This is a procedure that creates a 3-manifold from a knot $K$ in $S^3$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S_n^3(K)$, where $n$ is an integer called the surgery coefficient.\n*   **Condition for a Homology Sphere:** For the resulting manifold $S_n^3(K)$ to be an integral homology sphere (i.e., for its first homology group $H_1$ to be trivial), the absolute value of the surgery coefficient must be 1. So we are only interested in $n=+1$ and $n=-1$ surgeries.\n*   **Knots with at most four crossings:** We need to consider all knots up to crossing number 4. These are:\n    *   $0_1$: The unknot.\n    *   $3_1$: The trefoil knot. It is chiral, meaning it comes in two non-equivalent mirror forms: the right-handed trefoil ($3_{1, R}$) and the left-handed trefoil ($3_{1, L}$).\n    *   $4_1$: The figure-eight knot. It is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the Manifolds from Each Knot**\n\nWe perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of the listed knots and determine the class of the resulting homology sphere in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n1.  **The Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   Both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the unknot result in the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3$ represents the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Contribution:** The identity element, let's call it `0`.\n\n2.  **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   The figure-eight knot is a **slice knot**. This means it bounds a smooth disk in the 4-ball $B^4$.\n    *   A theorem by Casson and Gordon states that an integral surgery on a slice knot results in a manifold that is homology cobordant to the 3-sphere.\n    *   Therefore, both $S_{+1}^3(4_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(4_1)$ are homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n    *   **Contribution:** The identity element `0`.\n\n3.  **The Trefoil Knots ($3_{1,R}$ and $3_{1,L}$)**:\n    *   Let $K_R$ denote the right-handed trefoil and $K_L$ its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil.\n    *   Surgery on $K_R$ yields two manifolds: $S_{+1}^3(K_R)$ and $S_{-1}^3(K_R)$. Let the homology cobordism classes they represent be `q` and `p`, respectively.\n    *   Surgery on $K_L$ yields two other manifolds. There is a general formula relating surgery on a knot and its mirror: $S_n^3(m(K)) = -S_{-n}^3(K)$, where $m(K)$ is the mirror of $K$ and $-M$ denotes the manifold $M$ with its orientation reversed.\n        *   $S_{+1}^3(K_L) = S_{+1}^3(m(K_R)) = -S_{-1}^3(K_R)$. This represents the class `-p`.\n        *   $S_{-1}^3(K_L) = S_{-1}^3(m(K_R)) = -S_{+1}^3(K_R)$. This represents the class `-q`.\n    *   **Contribution:** The set of classes generated by the trefoils is `{p, q, -p, -q}`.\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Distinct Elements**\n\nNow we have a set of all generated elements: `{0, p, q, -p, -q}`. We need to determine how many of these are distinct. To do this, we use invariants of homology cobordism.\n\n*   **Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$)**: This is an integer-valued invariant for integral homology spheres that is constant on homology cobordism classes.\n    *   For the trefoil knot, the Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta(t) = t^{-1} - 1 + t$. The second derivative evaluated at -1 is $\\Delta''(-1) = -2$.\n    *   The Casson invariant for surgery on a knot is given by the formula $\\lambda(S_{\\pm 1}^3(K)) = \\mp \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_K''(-1)$.\n    *   For the class `p` represented by $S_{-1}^3(K_R)$: $\\lambda(p) = +\\frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1$.\n    *   For the class `q` represented by $S_{+1}^3(K_R)$: $\\lambda(q) = -\\frac{1}{2}(-2) = +1$.\n    *   The Casson invariant for an orientation-reversed manifold is the negative of the original: $\\lambda(-p) = -\\lambda(p) = +1$ and $\\lambda(-q) = -\\lambda(q) = -1$.\n    *   The invariant for the identity class is $\\lambda(0)=0$.\n\nLet's use these values to distinguish the classes:\n*   `0` is distinct from all others, as its $\\lambda$ invariant is 0 while the others' are $\\pm 1$.\n*   `p` is distinct from `q` because $\\lambda(p) = -1 \\neq \\lambda(q) = +1$.\n*   By comparing invariants, we see potential equalities: $\\lambda(p) = \\lambda(-q) = -1$ and $\\lambda(q) = \\lambda(-p) = +1$. This suggests that the class `p` might be the same as `-q`, and `q` might be the same as `-p`.\n\nThis suggests the relation `p = -q` (which is equivalent to `q = -p`). Let's verify this.\n*   The class `p` is represented by $S_{-1}^3(K_R)$.\n*   The class `-q` is represented by $S_{-1}^3(K_L)$.\n*   It is a known (and non-trivial) theorem in knot theory that these two manifolds, obtained by the same integer surgery on mirror knots, are not just homology cobordant but are in fact homeomorphic.\n*   Therefore, they represent the same element in the homology cobordism group. So, `p = -q`.\n\nIf we accept `p = -q`, our set of generated classes `{0, p, q, -p, -q}` reduces to `{0, p, q}`.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Count**\n\nThe three remaining classes are `0`, `p`, and `q`. Are they distinct?\n*   `[0]`: The identity element. $\\lambda(0)=0$.\n*   `p`: The class of $S_{-1}^3(3_{1, R})$ (the Poincar√© sphere). $\\lambda(p)=-1$.\n*   `q`: The class of $S_{+1}^3(3_{1, R})$. $\\lambda(q)=+1$.\n\nSince these three classes have distinct Casson invariants (0, -1, and 1), they must be distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\nThus, there are exactly three distinct elements."
