    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and when it was coined.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Genus and its Characteristics**\nThe question asks about the genus *Perdita* (Smith, 1853). This is a very large genus of bees belonging to the family Andrenidae. They are known for their extremely small size (often just 2-10 mm long) and frequently display bright, metallic, or gem-like coloration.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Native Range and \"Currently Used\" Common Name**\nThe native range of *Perdita* is North and Central America, with the highest diversity in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. To find the currently used common name within this range, we can consult reliable entomological resources. Sources such as BugGuide.net (an authoritative site for North American insects), university extension websites, and entomological field guides consistently refer to the genus *Perdita* by the common name **Fairy bees**. This name is apt, given their minute size and often delicate, exquisite appearance.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Origin Year of the Common Name**\nFinding the exact year a common name was \"coined\" can be more difficult than for a scientific name, as they often arise informally. However, we can look for the first significant publication where the name was formally proposed or used in an authoritative context.\n\n*   The leading expert on the genus *Perdita* for much of the 20th century was the entomologist Philip H. Timberlake.\n*   In his monumental work, \"A Revisional Study of the Bees of the Genus Perdita F. Smith, with a Synopsis of the Fauna of the Pacific Coast (Hymenoptera, Apoidea) Part I,\" published in *University of California Publications in Entomology* (Vol. 9, No. 6), Timberlake explicitly proposed this name.\n*   On page 346 of this publication, he wrote: \"Because of their minute size and often exquisite gemlike coloring they may be appropriately called **‘fairy bees.’**\"\n*   The year of this publication was **1954**. While the term might have been used colloquially before, this is the most widely cited and authoritative origin of the name being formally applied to the entire genus in scientific literature.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Distinguish between formal proposal and informal use:** A name might be used informally before it is published. However, the \"coining\" in a scientific context is typically attributed to the first major publication that suggests it, which in this case is Timberlake's 1954 revision.\n2.  **Specificity:** While \"mining bees\" can refer to the broader family Andrenidae, \"Fairy bees\" is the specific and widely accepted common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n3.  **Current Usage:** The name \"Fairy bees\" remains the standard common name used by entomologists and naturalists today, satisfying the \"currently used\" part of the question.\n4.  **Format:** The final answer must strictly follow the `<name>, <year>` format.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the common name for the genus *Perdita* is \"Fairy bees,\" and this name was formally proposed in the scientific literature in 1954 by P. H. Timberlake.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1954>>>"
