The set M should be defined as a closed subset of the Banach space of continuous functions on $[0,1]$. Specifically, $M = \{ u \in C[0,1] \mid u(0)=u(1)=0, \|u\|_{\infty} \le R \}$, where $\|\cdot\|_{\infty}$ is the supremum norm and $R$ is a positive constant chosen to satisfy the two conditions required for the operator $T$ to be a contraction on $M$: (1) $\frac{e^R}{8} \le R$ and (2) $R < \ln 8$. For instance, choosing $R=1$ would satisfy these conditions.
