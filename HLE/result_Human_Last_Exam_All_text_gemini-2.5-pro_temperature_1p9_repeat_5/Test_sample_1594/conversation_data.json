    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the buildings of Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Schools**\nThe first step is to accurately locate the two high schools. The schools are the \"Istituto di Istruzione Superiore (IIS) Galilei-Pacinotti\" and the \"Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini\". A quick search on a map service confirms they are situated adjacent to each other on Via Benedetto Croce in Pisa, Italy, and share a single large building complex.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the Aerial View**\nTo see the shape of the buildings, we need to look at them from above, using a satellite or aerial view from a service like Google Maps or Google Earth. When you switch to this view, you can see the entire layout of the complex that houses both schools.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Building Shapes and Configuration**\nUpon examining the aerial view of the school complex, we can identify its distinct parts:\n*   There is a long, primary building that runs from north to south along the western edge of the property (along Via Benedetto Croce). This long structure forms a vertical line.\n*   From the northern end of this long building, a shorter wing extends out to the east.\n*   From a point near the middle of the long building, another shorter wing also extends out to the east.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Letter**\nBy combining these three key structural elements, a clear letter emerges:\n*   The long north-south building acts as the vertical **stem** of the letter.\n*   The top eastward wing acts as the **top horizontal bar**.\n*   The middle eastward wing acts as the **middle horizontal bar**.\n\nThis combination of a vertical stem with two horizontal bars extending from its right side forms the distinct shape of a capital letter.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe arrangement of the main buildings of the complex shared by Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini, when seen from above, clearly forms the shape of the capital letter **F**.\n\n<<<F>>>"
