    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Understand the Question\n\nThe user is asking for an upper bound for a quantity denoted as $(k_{k,\\infty})$, which is called the \"maximum norm\". This upper bound should be expressed in terms of the covolume $(V)$ of a lattice. The context provided is the study of lattices constructed from squarefree natural numbers $(N)$.\n\n*   **Quantity to bound:** The \"maximum norm\", denoted $(k_{k,\\infty})$.\n*   **Bound in terms of:** The covolume, $V$.\n*   **Context:** Lattices associated with squarefree natural numbers $N$.\n\nThe specific mention of squarefree numbers $N$ and the language used often point to constructions in number theory and coding theory, particularly lattices derived from orders in quaternion algebras.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Context and Terminology\n\n1.  **Lattices from Squarefree N:** A common construction associates a lattice to a squarefree integer $N$. One considers a quaternion algebra $B$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ that is \"ramified\" at the prime factors of $N$ (and possibly at infinity). An order $\\mathcal{O}$ within this algebra $B$ can then be viewed as a lattice in a real vector space. For quaternion algebras over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the resulting lattice is 4-dimensional. So we set the dimension $k=4$.\n\n2.  **Covolume (V):** The covolume $V$ of a lattice is the volume of its fundamental domain. For a maximal order in a quaternion algebra over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with discriminant $N$, the covolume of the corresponding lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is given by $V = N/2$.\n\n3.  **Interpreting \"Maximum Norm\" $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This is the most crucial part of the analysis, as the term is non-standard and potentially ambiguous.\n    *   It cannot mean the norm of the \"longest\" vector in the lattice, as a lattice is an infinite set and has vectors of arbitrarily large norms.\n    *   It could refer to properties of a basis (like the longest vector in a reduced basis) or other lattice invariants like the covering radius $(\\mu)$ or the last successive minimum $(\\lambda_k)$. However, the bounds for these quantities often involve complex constants (like the Hermite constant) that don't seem to be implied here.\n    *   The most plausible interpretation comes from the notation itself. The subscript `âˆž` is the standard symbol for the **L-infinity norm** (also known as the **max norm**). The $L_\\infty$-norm of a vector $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_k)$ is defined as $||x||_\\infty = \\max_{i} |x_i|$. The term \"maximum norm\" in the question is likely a confusion of the name of the norm (\"max norm\") with the norm of a maximal element.\n    *   So, we interpret $(k_{k,\\infty})$ as a quantity related to the $L_\\infty$-norm for a $k$-dimensional lattice. Typically, one is interested in the shortest non-zero vector in a lattice. Thus, we conclude that the question is asking for an upper bound on $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}(L)$, which is defined as:\n        $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}(L) = \\min \\{ ||x||_\\infty \\mid x \\in L, x \\ne 0 \\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Relevant Mathematical Theorem\n\nThe problem reduces to finding an upper bound for the $L_\\infty$-norm of the shortest non-zero vector in a $k$-dimensional lattice $L$ with covolume $V$. The fundamental result that addresses this is **Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem**.\n\n1.  **Minkowski's Theorem:** Let $L$ be a $k$-dimensional lattice with covolume $V$. Let $K$ be a convex, centrally-symmetric body in $\\mathbb{R}^k$. If the volume of $K$ satisfies $\\text{vol}(K) \\ge 2^k V$, then $K$ must contain at least one non-zero lattice point from $L$.\n\n2.  **Choosing the Right Body:** To find a bound for the $L_\\infty$-norm, we choose the body $K$ to be a $k$-dimensional hypercube centered at the origin. A hypercube of side length $2R$ is given by $K = [-R, R]^k = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^k \\mid |x_i| \\le R \\text{ for all } i=1,\\dots,k \\}$. This body is convex and centrally symmetric.\n\n3.  **Applying the Theorem:**\n    *   The volume of this hypercube is $\\text{vol}(K) = (2R)^k$.\n    *   According to Minkowski's theorem, if we set the volume to be $2^k V$, we are guaranteed to find a non-zero lattice point inside. So, we set $(2R)^k = 2^k V$.\n    *   Solving for $R$ gives $R^k = V$, or $R = V^{1/k}$.\n    *   With this choice of $R$, there exists a non-zero vector $x \\in L$ such that $x$ is in the cube $K$.\n    *   For this vector $x$, by the definition of the cube, we have $|x_i| \\le R = V^{1/k}$ for all coordinates $x_i$.\n    *   This implies that the $L_\\infty$-norm of this vector is $||x||_\\infty = \\max_i|x_i| \\le V^{1/k}$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L)$ is the minimum of these norms over all non-zero vectors, it must also be less than or equal to this value.\n\n4.  **Conclusion from the Theorem:** We have derived the upper bound:\n    $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}(L) \\le V^{1/k}$.\n\n### Step 4: Finalize the Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the quantity $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is interpreted as $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}(L)$, the $L_\\infty$-norm of the shortest non-zero vector in a $k$-dimensional lattice $L$. The general upper bound for this quantity in terms of the covolume $V$ is $V^{1/k}$.\n\nThe specific context of \"squarefree natural numbers N\" points to lattices from quaternion algebras, which are 4-dimensional ($k=4$). Although the formula is general, the context implies $k=4$.\n\nThe upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ is $V^{1/k}$. For the specific case of lattices constructed from quaternion algebras over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the dimension $k=4$.\n\n<<<V^(1/4)>>>"
