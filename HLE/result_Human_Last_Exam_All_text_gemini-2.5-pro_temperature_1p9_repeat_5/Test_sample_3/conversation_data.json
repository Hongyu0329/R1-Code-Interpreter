    "This problem asks for the largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of torsion subgroups\nLet $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $K$. The set of $K$-rational points on $E$, denoted $E(K)$, forms an abelian group. The torsion subgroup of $E(K)$, denoted $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, consists of all points of finite order.\n\nA fundamental result states that for any number field $K$, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ is isomorphic to a group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for some integers $m, n \\ge 1$ where $m$ divides $n$.\n\nThe group is *cyclic* if $m=1$ and *non-cyclic* if $m > 1$. The order of this group is the product $mn$. We are looking for the maximum possible value of $mn$ under the condition that $m > 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the constraints imposed by the base field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nThe possible structures of the torsion subgroup are highly dependent on the field of definition $K$. For general number fields, Merel's Uniform Boundedness Theorem states that the order of the torsion subgroup is bounded by a constant that depends only on the degree of the field, $[K : \\mathbb{Q}]$. For our field, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the degree is 2.\n\nThe possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified. However, the possibilities for a *specific* quadratic field can be a smaller subset of this general list.\n\nThe field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special because it is not only a quadratic imaginary field but also the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, containing the primitive cube roots of unity. This property has a significant impact on the possible torsion structures.\n\nA key theorem relates the presence of full $p$-torsion to the roots of unity in the base field: If $E(K)$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ for a prime $p$, then the field $K$ must contain the $p$-th roots of unity, i.e., $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p) \\subseteq K$.\n\n*   For $p=2$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_2)=\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a subfield of any number field. So, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ is possible.\n*   For $p=3$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Since our field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, this condition is satisfied. Thus, $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ is a possible subgroup.\n*   For any prime $p > 3$, the degree of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)$ is $p-1 > 2$. Since $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$, $K$ cannot contain $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)$. This rules out the existence of $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ as a subgroup for $p > 3$. This strongly constrains the structure of non-cyclic torsion over $K$.\n\n### Step 3: Use the complete classification for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nThe most direct way to solve this problem is to use the known complete classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This result was established by F. Najman in the paper \"Torsion of elliptic curves over Q(sqrt(-3))\" (2012).\n\nAccording to this classification, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ are:\n1.  $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\\}$\n2.  $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$\n3.  $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the orders of all possible non-cyclic groups and find the maximum\nWe now compute the order for each group in the list above. The order of $\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/b\\mathbb{Z}$ is $ab$.\n\n**1. Orders for groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$:**\n*   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n*   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n*   $N=4$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 8 = 16$.\n*   $N=6$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 12 = 24$.\n*   $N=7$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/14\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 14 = 28$.\n\n**2. Orders for groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$:**\n*   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n*   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $3 \\times 9 = 27$.\n\n**3. Order for the group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$:**\n*   This group has order $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy comparing all the possible orders of non-cyclic torsion subgroups:\n$\\{4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 28, 9, 18, 27, 36\\}$\nThe largest order in this set is 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
