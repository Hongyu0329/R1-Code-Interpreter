    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the current word and its origin.**\n    The modern English word is \"sister\". Its etymology is complex. It descends from the Old English word *sweostor*, but its modern form, particularly the \"-i-\" vowel sound, was heavily influenced by the Old Norse word *systir*. Both words ultimately derive from the same Proto-Germanic root, **swestr*. The question asks us to imagine a timeline where the Norse influence did not happen.\n\n2.  **Determine the native Anglo-Saxon word.**\n    The word used by the Anglo-Saxons before the major period of Viking influence was **sweostor**. This is the starting point for our hypothetical linguistic evolution.\n\n3.  **Trace the natural evolution from Old English to Middle English.**\n    Languages undergo natural sound changes over time. To figure out what *sweostor* would have become, we need to trace its likely path into Middle English (c. 1150–1500).\n    *   The Old English diphthong \"eo\" in *sweostor* would have simplified.\n    *   Historical records from areas with less Norse influence show that *sweostor* evolved into forms like *swuster* and, most commonly, **suster** in Middle English. This change from the 'eo' diphthong to a 'u' sound is a known developmental path in English.\n\n4.  **Trace the evolution from Middle English to Modern English.**\n    Now we take the common Middle English form, **suster**, and apply the sound changes that occurred between Middle and Modern English. The most significant set of changes was the Great Vowel Shift, but that primarily affected long vowels.\n    *   The vowel in *suster* (pronounced with a short 'u' sound, /ʊ/, as in \"put\") was short, indicated by the consonant cluster '-st-'.\n    *   The standard sound change for the short Middle English 'u' (/ʊ/) is for it to become the modern /ʌ/ sound (the \"STRUT\" vowel, as heard in words like *cup*, *sun*, *butter*).\n    *   For example: Middle English *sunne* became *sun*, and *butere* became *butter*.\n    *   Applying this change to *suster* (/sʊstər/), the pronunciation would evolve to /ˈsʌstər/.\n\n5.  **Construct the hypothetical modern word.**\n    Based on the phonetic evolution from *suster* to /ˈsʌstər/, the word would retain its spelling. Therefore, without the influence of Old Norse *systir*, the native English word would have evolved into **suster**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Norse Influence is Key:** The critical part of the question is to *remove* the influence of Old Norse. The word \"sister\" that we use today is a direct result of that influence replacing the vowel sound of the native word. The 'i' sound comes from *systir*.\n*   **Phonetic Evolution:** The answer relies on predictable patterns of English language sound change. The evolution of the Old English *sweostor* to the Middle English *suster* is well-documented. The subsequent evolution of the short 'u' vowel is one of the most consistent changes in the history of English.\n*   **Dialectal Survival:** The form \"suster\" actually survived in some regional English dialects for centuries, even while \"sister\" became the standard. This provides real-world evidence that \"suster\" was the natural, native descendant of the Old English word.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe native Anglo-Saxon word *sweostor* would have naturally evolved through Middle English (*suster*) into a modern form that would be spelled and pronounced as **suster**, rhyming with \"buster\" or \"duster\". The Old Norse *systir* interrupted this natural development, giving us our current word \"sister\".\n\n<<<suster>>>"
