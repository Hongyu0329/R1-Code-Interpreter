After applying the gate Q to the first ququint of the entangled pair and then performing a measurement on it, the system collapses into a statistical mixture of states. The final state of the two-ququint system depends on the measurement outcome. The possible final states and their probabilities are:
- With probability 2/10, the system is in the state $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 2/10, the system is in the state $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 3/10, the system is in the state $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 2/10, the system is in the state $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 1/10, the system is in the state $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
