    "An analysis of the question of computing the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\)**\n\nThe term \"generalized Markov number\" can refer to several different concepts in mathematical literature. A prominent and computationally accessible definition arises in the context of cluster algebras and Chebyshev polynomials. For a rational number \\( p/q \\) with a continued fraction expansion \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] \\), the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) (sometimes denoted \\( x_{p/q} \\)) is defined by the value \\( K_n \\), where the sequence \\( K_i \\) is generated by the linear recurrence relation:\n\\( K_i = a_i K_{i-1} - K_{i-2} \\) for \\( i \\ge 1 \\)\nwith initial values \\( K_{-1} = 0 \\) and \\( K_0 = 1 \\).\nThese numbers \\(K_i\\) are also known as continuant polynomials evaluated with a negative sign.\n\nWe will use this definition to compute \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n**Careful Point 1:** There are multiple non-equivalent definitions of \"generalized Markov numbers\". The chosen definition is based on its appearance in multiple modern sources and its consistency with computed examples in those sources (e.g., \\(m_{1/4}=4\\), \\(m_{2/5}=3\\)). The classical Markov numbers (1, 2, 5, 13, ...) form a different sequence and are related to a different Diophantine equation.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\)**\n\nTo apply the recurrence relation, we first need the coefficients \\( a_i \\) of the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\). We use the Euclidean algorithm on the fraction \\( 7/4 \\):\n1.  \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n2.  \\( \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4/3} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1/3} \\)\nSo, \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}} = [1; 1, 3] \\).\nThe continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) is the reciprocal of this:\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\nThe coefficients we will use are \\( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 3 \\). The length of this sequence is \\( n=3 \\).\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The continued fraction expansion must be the standard one. The integer part is handled by \\(a_0\\), and the recurrence uses the coefficients \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots\\).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the recurrence relation to find \\( m_{4/7} \\)**\n\nWe need to compute \\( K_3 \\) using the coefficients \\( a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3 \\).\nThe recurrence is \\( K_i = a_i K_{i-1} - K_{i-2} \\), with initial values \\( K_{-1} = 0 \\) and \\( K_0 = 1 \\).\n\n*   For \\( i=1 \\):\n    \\( K_1 = a_1 K_0 - K_{-1} = (1)(1) - 0 = 1 \\)\n*   For \\( i=2 \\):\n    \\( K_2 = a_2 K_1 - K_0 = (1)(1) - 1 = 0 \\)\n*   For \\( i=3 \\):\n    \\( K_3 = a_3 K_2 - K_1 = (3)(0) - 1 = -1 \\)\n\nSo, we have found that the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is -1.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The recurrence relation has a minus sign (\\(-K_{i-2}\\)), unlike the recurrence for the denominators of the convergents (\\(q_i = a_i q_{i-1} + q_{i-2}\\)). This distinction is crucial.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the continued fraction of the result**\n\nThe final step is to find the continued fraction associated with the number we just computed, which is -1.\nThe continued fraction for any integer \\( n \\) is simply \\( [n] \\), as the algorithm for finding the continued fraction terminates immediately.\nFor the integer -1, we have \\( a_0 = \\lfloor -1 \\rfloor = -1 \\). The remainder is \\( -1 - (-1) = 0 \\), so the process stops.\nThe continued fraction for -1 is \\( [-1] \\).\n\n**Careful Point 4:** The standard definition of a simple continued fraction \\( [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots] \\) requires \\( a_i \\) to be positive integers for \\( i \\ge 1 \\). The representation \\( [-1] \\) is standard for the integer -1. An alternative representation, e.g. \\([-2; 1]\\), is possible but not the canonical simple form. The most direct computation yields \\( [-1] \\).\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) for \\( p/q = [0; a_1, \\ldots, a_n] \\) is \\( K_n \\) from the recurrence \\( K_i = a_i K_{i-1} - K_{i-2} \\) with \\( K_{-1}=0, K_0=1 \\).\n2.  The continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\), so \\( a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3 \\).\n3.  The calculation yields \\( K_1=1, K_2=0, K_3=-1 \\). Thus, \\( m_{4/7} = -1 \\).\n4.  The continued fraction of -1 is \\( [-1] \\).\n\nThe final answer is the continued fraction of -1.\n\n<<<[-1]>>>"
