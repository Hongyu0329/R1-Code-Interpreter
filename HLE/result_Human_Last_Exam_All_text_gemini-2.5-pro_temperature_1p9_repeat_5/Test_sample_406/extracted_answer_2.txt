The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. The primary conditions are:
1.  The sets X, Y, and Z must be non-empty complete metric spaces.
2.  The functions F, G, and H must collectively act as a contraction mapping on the product space X × Y × Z. This is satisfied if each function adheres to a specific Lipschitz-type condition with constants (`a, b, c` for F; `e, f` for G; `g, h, i` for H) such that the sums of these constants corresponding to each space are less than 1: `(a + e + i < 1)`, `(b + f + h < 1)`, and `(c + g < 1)`.
