    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a set of points from different spaces that are simultaneously fixed by a system of functions F, G, and H. To find the conditions for the existence of such a point, we can generalize the celebrated Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a system of equations defined on product spaces.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\"**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\", as it is not a standard definition. Given the functions:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z` (We assume the second 'G' in the prompt is a typo and should be 'H').\n\nA fixed point `p` for a function `f` satisfies `f(p) = p`. Generalizing this to the given system, an **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` that satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Mathematical Framework**\n\nThe existence of fixed points is typically proven using fixed-point theorems. The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem (or Contraction Mapping Principle) is a powerful tool that guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point. We will apply it here.\n\nThe theorem requires:\n1.  A **complete metric space** `(M, d)`.\n2.  A **contraction mapping** `T: M → M`. A mapping is a contraction if there is a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that `d(T(a), T(b)) ≤ k * d(a, b)` for all `a, b ∈ M`.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Metric Space and the Mapping**\n\nTo use the theorem, we need to define a single space `M` and a single mapping `T`.\n\n*   **The Space (M):** We can combine the three spaces X, Y, and Z into a single product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n*   **The Metric (d):** To make `W` a metric space, we first assume that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are metric spaces. We can then define a metric `d` on `W`. A standard choice is the sum metric:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   **The Mapping (T):** We define an operator `T: W → W` based on our system of equations:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n    A fixed point of this operator `T` is a point `(x, y, z)` such that `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, which is exactly the system defining our FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Conditions**\n\nNow, we apply the requirements of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to our constructed space `W` and operator `T`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Completeness of the Space**\n    The Banach theorem requires the metric space to be **complete**. The product space `(W, d)` is complete if and only if each of the component spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` is complete.\n    *   **Condition 1:** `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty complete metric spaces.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Contraction Condition for T**\n    The operator `T` must be a contraction mapping on `W`. This means there must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d(w₁, w₂)`\n\n    Let's expand this inequality:\n    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * [d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)]`\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Decomposing the Contraction Condition**\n    The large inequality above can be satisfied if each function F, G, and H satisfies a respective Lipschitz-type condition. Let's assume there exist non-negative constants such that:\n\n    a) `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a⋅d_X(x₁, x₂) + b⋅d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c⋅d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    b) `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ e⋅d_X(x₁, x₂) + f⋅d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    c) `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ g⋅d_Z(z₁, z₂) + h⋅d_Y(y₁, y₂) + i⋅d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n    Adding these three inequalities gives:\n    `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (a+e+i)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (b+f+h)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (c+g)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\n    For this to be a contraction, we need `(a+e+i)d_X + (b+f+h)d_Y + (c+g)d_Z ≤ k(d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` for some `k < 1`. This is guaranteed if the coefficients are all less than 1.\n    *   **Condition 2:** The functions F, G, and H must be contractions in their arguments such that the sum of the contraction constants for each space is less than 1. Specifically, there exist non-negative constants `a, b, c, e, f, g, h, i` satisfying the Lipschitz-type conditions above, such that:\n        `a + e + i < 1`\n        `b + f + h < 1`\n        `c + g < 1`\n\nIf these conditions are met, the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem ensures that there exists a **unique** FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Final Summary of Conditions\n\nFor the functions `F: X×Y×Z→X`, `G: Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` satisfying `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`, the following conditions derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem are sufficient:\n\n1.  **Space Condition:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be non-empty complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Function Condition (Contraction):** There must exist non-negative constants (`a, b, c, e, f, g, h, i`) such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a⋅d_X(x₁, x₂) + b⋅d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c⋅d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ e⋅d_X(x₁, x₂) + f⋅d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ g⋅d_Z(z₁, z₂) + h⋅d_Y(y₁, y₂) + i⋅d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n3.  **Overall Contraction Requirement:** The sums of the Lipschitz constants for each component space must be strictly less than 1:\n    *   `a + e + i < 1`\n    *   `b + f + h < 1`\n    *   `c + g < 1`\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. The primary conditions are:\n1.  The sets X, Y, and Z must be non-empty complete metric spaces.\n2.  The functions F, G, and H must collectively act as a contraction mapping on the product space X × Y × Z. This is satisfied if each function adheres to a specific Lipschitz-type condition with constants (`a, b, c` for F; `e, f` for G; `g, h, i` for H) such that the sums of these constants corresponding to each space are less than 1: `(a + e + i < 1)`, `(b + f + h < 1)`, and `(c + g < 1)`.>>>"
