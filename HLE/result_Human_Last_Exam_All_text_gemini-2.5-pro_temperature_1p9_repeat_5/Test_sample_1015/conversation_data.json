    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A ballet term that means \"bent backwards.\" It is a backbend performed while standing, originating from the waist, but engaging the entire upper body and spine.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A highly structured and codified Russian ballet technique developed by Agrippina Vaganova. It is known for its precision, strength, and emphasis on epaulement (the carriage of the upper body, head, and shoulders) and maintaining a strong, stable core and hip alignment.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** A neoclassical ballet style developed by George Balanchine. It is characterized by extreme speed, musicality, deep pliés, open lines, and often a less rigid, more stylized upper body. It pushes the boundaries of classical technique to create dynamic and visually expansive movement.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Execution of Cambré Derrière in the Vaganova Method**\n\n*   The movement is initiated from the upper back, lifting the sternum (breastbone) towards the ceiling.\n*   The fundamental rule is to keep the hips absolutely square and pressed forward. The pelvis should not tilt or be released. The goal is to isolate the bend in the upper and middle spine.\n*   The weight must be kept evenly on both feet (or firmly on the supporting leg) without shifting back.\n*   This technique builds immense upper back flexibility and core strength, as the bend happens without compromising the stable base of the hips. The resulting line is pure and controlled.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Execution of Cambré Derrière in the Balanchine Method**\n\n*   The emphasis is on creating a larger, more dramatic, and visually sweeping line.\n*   To achieve a deeper and more extreme backbend, the Balanchine style allows for—and often encourages—the release of the hip. The dancer pushes the hip(s) forward and sometimes slightly to the side.\n*   This \"breaking\" or \"releasing\" of the hipline allows the dancer to bend further back, creating a more dramatic arc with the body.\n*   While it may appear to create a greater degree of backbend, it is achieved through a different mechanical principle than the Vaganova method. The focus is on the aesthetic line rather than the strict maintenance of pelvic alignment.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While arm styles (port de bras) differ between the methods, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the mechanics of the cambré itself.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the critical point of divergence. Vaganova insists on squared, stable hips. Balanchine permits a released, pushed-forward hip. This is the core technical difference that dictates how the movement is performed and how it looks.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a cambré can be performed at any speed in either technique. Speed is a quality of the choreography, not a defining mechanical difference of this specific step.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The difference in hip placement *results* in a different-looking degree of backbend. The Balanchine cambré often appears deeper because of the released hip. However, the *cause* of this difference is the hip placement. Therefore, \"Placement of hip\" is a more precise and fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** Head placement is also a result of the overall bend and style. The more extreme line in the Balanchine cambré often leads to a more released head position, but this is a secondary effect of the primary difference in hip and spine mechanics.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most significant and defining technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the treatment of the hips. Vaganova prioritizes stability and a square pelvis, while Balanchine prioritizes a dramatic line, which is often achieved by releasing the hip.\n\n<<<B>>>"
