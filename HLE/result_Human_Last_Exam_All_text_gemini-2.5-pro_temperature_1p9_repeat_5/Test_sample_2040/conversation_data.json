    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n    *   SPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process.\n    *   In SPDC, one photon of higher energy (the \"pump\" photon, frequency ω_p) spontaneously splits into two photons of lower energy (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons, frequencies ω_s and ω_i) inside a nonlinear medium.\n    *   This process is governed by the conservation of energy (ω_p = ω_s + ω_i) and momentum (k_p = k_s + k_i).\n    *   Crucially, SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical effect**. The strength of this effect in a material is quantified by its second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as `χ⁽²⁾`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Necessary Material Property for SPDC**\n    *   For a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear optical effect, including SPDC, its second-order nonlinear susceptibility `χ⁽²⁾` must be non-zero.\n    *   This leads to the core of the question: Do free-standing boron nanosheets have a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾`?\n\n3.  **Relate Material Property (`χ⁽²⁾`) to Physical Structure (Crystal Symmetry)**\n    *   There is a fundamental selection rule in nonlinear optics based on the material's crystal symmetry.\n    *   A material can only possess a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾` if its crystal structure **lacks a center of inversion**. Such materials are called non-centrosymmetric.\n    *   If a material's crystal lattice has a center of inversion (i.e., it is centrosymmetric), then `χ⁽²⁾` is identically zero due to symmetry constraints. In such a material, applying an electric field `E` and its inverse `-E` should produce opposite polarizations `P` and `-P`. However, the second-order polarization is proportional to `E²`. Since `(-E)² = E²`, the polarization would be the same in both cases, which creates a contradiction unless the effect is zero.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n    *   Boron nanosheets, often called borophene, are 2D allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single stable structure, borophene has multiple experimentally realized and theoretically predicted structures (polymorphs).\n    *   The most common and stable forms of borophene that have been synthesized on substrates (like Ag(111)) are the **β₁₂** and **χ₃** phases.\n    *   We must examine the crystal symmetry of these structures. Both the β₁₂ sheet (space group *Pmmn*) and the χ₃ sheet (space group *Cmcm*) are **centrosymmetric**. They possess a center of inversion within their 2D lattice.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings and Formulate the Answer**\n    *   Since SPDC requires a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾`.\n    *   And a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾` requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n    *   But the common, stable forms of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n    *   Therefore, the `χ⁽²⁾` of these boron nanosheets is zero.\n    *   This means that pristine, unstrained, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Pristine vs. Real-World Material:** The analysis above applies to a perfect, pristine, free-standing boron nanosheet. In reality, factors can break the perfect inversion symmetry.\n    *   **Edges:** The edges of a finite nanosheet inherently break the bulk symmetry, which could lead to a very weak, localized `χ⁽²⁾` and thus negligible SPDC.\n    *   **Defects:** Point defects or line defects in the crystal lattice can break local inversion symmetry.\n    *   **Strain:** Applying a non-uniform strain can distort the lattice in a way that breaks inversion symmetry, potentially inducing a `χ⁽²⁾`.\n    *   **Substrate Interaction:** If the nanosheet were on a substrate, the interaction could break the symmetry. However, the question specifies \"free-standing.\"\n\n2.  **Higher-Order Effects:** While the dominant electric-dipole-based `χ⁽²⁾` is zero, there can be much weaker nonlinear effects arising from electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole interactions. SPDC through these mechanisms is theoretically possible but would be many orders of magnitude weaker and for all practical purposes would be considered non-existent or unobservable.\n\n3.  **Third-Order Effects:** Centrosymmetric materials like boron nanosheets can have a non-zero *third-order* nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽³⁾`), allowing processes like third-harmonic generation or four-wave mixing. This is different from the second-order process of SPDC.\n\n### Final Conclusion Step-by-Step\n\n*   **Premise 1:** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\n*   **Premise 2:** Second-order processes are forbidden by symmetry in centrosymmetric materials.\n*   **Premise 3:** The stable, common forms of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion under normal conditions. The effect is forbidden by the material's intrinsic crystal symmetry.\n\n<<<No. Free-standing boron nanosheets, in their common and stable structural forms (such as β₁₂ and χ₃), are centrosymmetric. This crystal symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes, including spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), because the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is identically zero.>>>"
