No. Free-standing boron nanosheets, in their common and stable structural forms (such as β₁₂ and χ₃), are centrosymmetric. This crystal symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes, including spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), because the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is identically zero.
