    "This question requires a careful, step-by-step analysis, searching through the canonical books of the Old and New Testaments in order and cross-referencing them with the complete works of William Shakespeare.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\n1.  **\"First book in the Bible, in canonical order\":** We must proceed sequentially from Genesis forward (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings... etc.).\n2.  **\"To be mentioned by name\":** This is a crucial distinction. We are not looking for allusions to biblical stories or characters (like Adam, Noah, or Cain), but the actual title of the biblical book itself (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Exodus\").\n3.  **\"In a Shakespeare play\":** The source must be one of Shakespeare's accepted plays.\n4.  **\"Which play is it mentioned in?\":** We need to identify the specific play where the first mention occurs.\n\n**Step 2: Systematic search through the books of the Bible.**\n\n*   **Genesis:** While the stories and characters of Genesis are alluded to more than any other book (Adam, Eve, Cain, Jacob, the Flood), the word \"Genesis\" is never used to name the book in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n*   **Exodus, Leviticus:** These books are not mentioned by name. The word \"exodus\" appears, but it is used in its general sense of \"departure,\" not as a book title.\n*   **Numbers:** This is a tricky case and a common point of confusion. A widespread piece of trivia claims the \"Book of Numbers\" is mentioned in *Henry V* or *The Comedy of Errors*. However, a careful search of the standard First Folio texts of these plays reveals no such mention. The references appear to be either from heavily amended later editions or are simply apocryphal. We must therefore conclude there is no verifiable mention of the Book of Numbers by name in Shakespeare.\n*   **Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther:** None of these books are mentioned by their title.\n*   **Job:** The character of Job is mentioned several times as an exemplar of poverty and patience (e.g., \"as poor as Job\" in *2 Henry IV* and \"the patience of Job\" in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*). However, these are references to the person, not explicitly to the *Book of Job*.\n*   **Psalms:** Here we find our first definitive mention. The Book of Psalms is clearly identified in two separate plays:\n    1.  In *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act II, Scene 1), Mistress Ford, having received an unwanted love letter from Falstaff, notes how his pious words and unholy intentions don't match, saying they \"do no more adhere and keep pace together than the **Hundredth Psalm** to the tune of ‘Green Sleeves.’\" This is a specific, undeniable naming of a part of the book.\n    2.  In *The Second Part of Henry the Fourth* (Act III, Scene 2), Justice Shallow says, \"death, **as the Psalmist saith**, is certain to all; all shall die.\" This refers to the author of the Psalms and, by direct extension, the book itself.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nSince we have found no verifiable mentions of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, or any subsequent book before Psalms, the Book of Psalms is the first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name.\n\nThe most direct and unambiguous mention is in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n\n**Final Analysis:**\n*   **Book:** The Book of Psalms.\n*   **Play:** *The Merry Wives of Windsor*. (Also mentioned in *2 Henry IV*, but the *Merry Wives* reference is more specific.)\n\n<<<The first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the **Book of Psalms**, and it is mentioned in **The Merry Wives of Windsor**.>>>"
