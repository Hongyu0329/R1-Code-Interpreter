    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements of the question:** The query is about a specific artwork and its acquisition by a museum. The key elements are:\n    *   **Artwork Title:** \"The Radionist\" (German: *Der Radionist*)\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year of Acquisition:** 1967\n    *   **Information to find:** The name of the museum that acquired it.\n\n2.  **Formulate a research strategy:** The most direct way to find this information is to search for the artwork's provenance (history of ownership). A good starting point is to search online art databases or museum collections for \"Kurt Günther The Radionist\" or \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist\".\n\n3.  **Execute the research:**\n    *   A search reveals that the painting \"Der Radionist\" is a well-known work of the New Objectivity movement in Germany.\n    *   Art collection databases, such as the Bildindex der Kunst und Architektur in Germany, list this painting.\n    *   These sources identify the current owner as the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections).\n\n4.  **Verify the acquisition details:**\n    *   The next step is to confirm the year of acquisition. This requires checking the official records or the provenance information listed by the museum itself.\n    *   The Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden online collection provides details for its artworks. The entry for \"Der Radionist\" (inventory number Gal.-Nr. 3470) specifies its provenance.\n    *   The record confirms that the painting was acquired in **1967** from the artist's estate.\n    *   The specific museum within the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden that houses this painting is the **Galerie Neue Meister** (New Masters Gallery).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Correct Name:** It's important to use both the English (\"The Radionist\") and original German (\"Der Radionist\") titles to ensure comprehensive search results.\n*   **Museum vs. Museum Complex:** The Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (SKD) is a large complex of museums. The specific gallery holding the painting is the Galerie Neue Meister. While \"Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden\" is correct, \"Galerie Neue Meister\" is more precise.\n*   **Confirming the Date:** The acquisition date of 1967 is the critical piece of information that confirms we have found the correct provenance record.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracing the provenance of the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther, we can confirm that it is held by the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden, and that the museum's own records state it was acquired in 1967.\n\n<<<Galerie Neue Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"
