    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Careful Points and Interpretation\n\n1.  **Flags as Matrices**: We view each flag as a matrix where each entry corresponds to the color at a particular point.\n2.  **Maximal Rank**: The instruction to assume maximal rank is crucial. This means we assign distinct, algebraically independent numerical values to each different color. For instance, if a flag has Red, White, and Blue, we could conceptually assign Red=`r`, White=`w`, and Blue=`b`, where no linear relationship exists between these values (e.g., `r=2w` is disallowed). This ensures that any linear dependence in the matrix's rows or columns comes from the flag's geometric *pattern*, not from an accidental choice of color values.\n3.  **Rank Definition**: The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns). In this context, it is the number of linearly independent row patterns or column patterns. If a flag has `k` distinct row patterns, its rank will be `k` unless some of these patterns are linear combinations of others.\n4.  **Basis Vectors Approach**: A powerful way to determine the rank is to find a minimal set of basis vectors that can be combined to form every row (or column) in the flag's matrix. The size of this basis set is the rank.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross.\n*   **Row Patterns**: If we look at the rows of the flag, there are only two distinct patterns:\n    1.  A row that is part of the red field but intersected by the vertical bar of the cross (e.g., a pattern of `[Red, Red, White, Red, Red]`). All such rows are identical.\n    2.  A row that forms the horizontal bar of the cross (e.g., a pattern of `[White, White, White, White, White]`). All such rows are identical.\n*   **Column Patterns**: Similarly, there are only two distinct patterns for the columns:\n    1.  A column in the red field intersected by the horizontal bar (e.g., `[Red, Red, White, Red]T`).\n    2.  A column forming the vertical bar of the cross (e.g., `[White, White, White, White]T`).\n*   **Rank Calculation**: Let's call the two row patterns `v1` (Red/White/Red) and `v2` (all White). Since the colors Red and White are assigned independent values, `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent. As all rows in the flag are either type `v1` or `v2`, the entire row space is spanned by these two vectors. Therefore, the dimension of the row space is 2.\n    \n    The rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Flags of African Nations\n\nWe need to find African flags whose design structure also results in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1**: These are the simplest flags.\n    *   **Examples**: Horizontal or vertical tricolors (or bicolors) with no other symbols, such as Nigeria (vertical green-white-green), Chad (vertical blue-yellow-red), or Gabon (horizontal green-yellow-blue).\n    *   **Reasoning**: For a horizontal tricolor, every column has the exact same pattern of colors (e.g., `[Green, Yellow, Blue]T`). Since all columns are identical, the column space is spanned by a single vector. The rank is 1. For a vertical tricolor, the same logic applies to the rows.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank > 2**: These flags have complex geometric patterns.\n    *   **Examples**: Flags with diagonal elements (Tanzania, Namibia), complex emblems spanning the flag in an irregular way (Burundi, South Africa), or designs with many distinct features (Liberia, Togo).\n    *   **Reasoning**: These designs create many unique row and column patterns that are not simple linear combinations of each other, resulting in a rank of 3 or higher. For example, the star in the flag of Somalia creates multiple, distinct row patterns (`[Blue, Blue, White, Blue, Blue]`, `[Blue, White, Blue, White, Blue]`, etc.) that are linearly independent.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2**: These flags typically have a simple background structure (like a bicolor or tricolor, which would be rank 1 on its own) that is \"perturbed\" in a uniform way by a central emblem, a star, or an intersecting bar. This perturbation introduces exactly one new linearly independent vector to the basis.\n\nThis structure appears in three main forms:\n\n1.  **A Bicolor/Tricolor with a Central Emblem Spanning All Stripes**:\n    *   **Example: Ethiopia**. Green-yellow-red horizontal stripes with a central blue disc/emblem. The rows are of these types: all green, all yellow, all red, and rows of each color that are interrupted by the central emblem. The entire set of rows can be spanned by just two basis vectors: a constant vector `u1 = [1, 1, ..., 1]` (for the stripe colors) and a perturbation vector `u2 = [0, ..., 1, ..., 0]` (for the emblem's position). Thus, the rank is 2.\n    *   Other Flags: **Angola**, **Burkina Faso**.\n\n2.  **A Bicolor/Tricolor with an Emblem on a Single Stripe**:\n    *   **Example: Ghana**. Red-yellow-green horizontal stripes with a black star on the central yellow stripe. The row types are: all red, all green, and yellow-with-a-star. This set of rows is also spanned by two basis vectors (`u1` for the background stripes and `u2` for the star's perturbation). The rank is 2.\n    *   Other Flags: **Cameroon**, **Egypt**, **Lesotho**, **Libya**, **Malawi**, **Niger**, **Rwanda**, **Senegal**.\n\n3.  **A Striped Flag Intersected by a Contrasting Bar**:\n    *   **Example: Central African Republic**. Four horizontal stripes (blue, white, green, yellow) are intersected by a single vertical red bar. The rows are of the form `[Blue, Red, Blue]`, `[White, Red, White]`, etc. All these row vectors can be formed by a linear combination of just two basis vectors: `u1 = [1, 0, 1]` and `u2 = [0, 1, 0]`. The rank is 2.\n    *   Other Flags: **Mauritania** (its red top/bottom bars act as perturbations on a green field with a central emblem, creating a rank 2 structure).\n\nBased on this analysis, the following African nations have flags with a linear algebraic rank of 2:\n*   Algeria\n*   Angola\n*   Burkina Faso\n*   Cameroon\n*   Central African Republic\n*   Egypt\n*   Ethiopia\n*   Ghana\n*   Lesotho\n*   Libya\n*   Malawi\n*   Mauritania\n*   Niger\n*   Rwanda\n*   Senegal\n\n<<<Algeria, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lesotho, Libya, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal>>>"
