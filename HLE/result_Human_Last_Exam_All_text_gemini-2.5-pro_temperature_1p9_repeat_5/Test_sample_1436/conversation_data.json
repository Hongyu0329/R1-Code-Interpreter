    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the symmetry factor `S` of a Feynman diagram in the context of perturbative quantum field theory (specifically, Green's function analysis). The key features of the diagram are:\n1.  **Two vertices:** The diagram is of second order in the coupling constant.\n2.  **Four field contractions:** This means there are four internal lines (propagators) in the diagram.\n3.  These four contractions connect the two vertices, meaning all four lines run between vertex 1 and vertex 2.\n\nThis describes a vacuum bubble diagram that looks like two dots connected by four parallel lines, sometimes called an \"eye\" or \"sunglasses\" diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will calculate the symmetry factor using two standard methods to ensure the result is robust. We'll assume the simplest context where such a diagram appears: a scalar field theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction, where the interaction Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$.\n\n**Method 1: Using Topological Symmetry Rules**\n\nThe symmetry factor `S` of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which means it's the number of ways you can permute its lines and vertices without changing the diagram's topology.\n\n1.  **Symmetry from permuting internal lines:** The diagram has four identical propagators connecting the same two vertices. We can exchange any of these four lines with each other, and the diagram remains unchanged. The number of permutations of these four lines is `4!`.\n    *   Factor = `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`.\n\n2.  **Symmetry from permuting vertices:** The two vertices are connected in an identical manner. If we swap the positions of vertex 1 and vertex 2, the diagram is topologically identical (it's still two vertices connected by four lines). The number of permutations of these two vertices is `2!`.\n    *   Factor = `2! = 2 × 1 = 2`.\n\n3.  **Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the factors from all independent symmetry operations.\n    *   `S = (Factor from line permutations) × (Factor from vertex permutations)`\n    *   `S = 4! × 2! = 24 × 2 = 48`.\n\n**Method 2: Calculation from First Principles (Wick Contractions)**\n\nThis method derives the numerical pre-factor of the diagram's amplitude, and the symmetry factor `S` is the inverse of this pre-factor.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant term:** The diagram arises from the second-order term in the perturbation series for the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude:\n    *   $ \\frac{1}{2!} \\left< T \\left[ \\left( \\int d^4x_1 \\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4(x_1) \\right) \\left( \\int d^4x_2 \\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4(x_2) \\right) \\right] \\right>_0 $\n\n2.  **Isolate the numerical pre-factors:** The numerical factors coming from the expansion and the Lagrangian are:\n    *   $\\frac{1}{2!} \\left( \\frac{1}{4!} \\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Count the number of equivalent Wick contractions:** We need to count the number of ways to connect all four fields at vertex $x_1$ with all four fields at vertex $x_2$.\n    *   Take the first field at $x_1$. There are 4 choices of fields at $x_2$ to contract it with.\n    *   Take the second field at $x_1$. There are 3 remaining fields at $x_2$ to contract with.\n    *   Take the third field at $x_1$. There are 2 remaining choices at $x_2$.\n    *   Take the final field at $x_1$. There is only 1 choice left at $x_2$.\n    *   The total number of ways to form the set of four contractions is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4! = 24$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final numerical coefficient:** We multiply the factors together.\n    *   Coefficient = (Taylor factor) $\\times$ (Lagrangian factors) $\\times$ (Contraction factor)\n    *   Coefficient = $ \\frac{1}{2!} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{4!} \\right)^2 \\times 4! = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4! \\times 4!} \\times 4! = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 4!} $\n    *   Coefficient = $ \\frac{1}{2 \\times 24} = \\frac{1}{48} $\n\n5.  **Extract the symmetry factor:** The diagram's contribution to the amplitude is written in the form $\\frac{1}{S} \\times (\\text{integral part})$. Comparing our coefficient of $\\frac{1}{48}$ with $\\frac{1}{S}$, we find `S = 48`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagram Topology:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the description. \"Two vertices and four field contractions\" means four propagators. The key is that these four contractions are *between* the two vertices, not including any self-loops or external lines.\n2.  **Assumed Theory:** The calculation assumes a theory where the vertices allow for four fields, like the common $\\phi^4$ scalar theory. The factor of `1/4!` in the Lagrangian is standard and crucial for the first-principles calculation.\n3.  **Line Symmetry:** The factor of `4!` arises because the four propagators are functionally identical. They connect the same start point (vertex 1) to the same end point (vertex 2) and represent the same field.\n4.  **Vertex Symmetry:** The factor of `2!` arises because the two vertices are interchangeable. Without external lines to distinguish them, swapping them leads to the exact same diagrammatic contribution. If the vertices were of different types, this symmetry would not exist.\n5.  **No Self-Loops:** This diagram does not contain any lines connecting a vertex to itself (tadpoles). If it did, there would be additional symmetry factors to consider (typically a factor of 2 for each such line in a scalar theory).\n6.  **Symmetry Factor Definition:** Remember that the contribution of a diagram to an amplitude is proportional to `1/S`, not `S`. `S` is the integer that corrects for the overcounting of topologically identical diagrams in the expansion.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the symmetry factor is the product of the line permutation factor (4!) and the vertex permutation factor (2!).\n\n`S = 4! × 2! = 24 × 2 = 48`\n\n<<<48>>>"
