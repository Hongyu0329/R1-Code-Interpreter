**No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial. Instead, it follows the orientation of the Parker Spiral.** Due to the Sun's rotation, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) lines are twisted into a spiral shape. At the distance of L1 (1 AU), the angle between the IMF and the radial direction is typically around 45 degrees.

The justification for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the *radial direction* (e.g., the Y and Z components in a GSE coordinate system) to calculate helicity lies in **Taylor's Hypothesis**, which is highly applicable at the L1 point. Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Super-Alfvénic Solar Wind:** The solar wind at L1 moves at a very high speed (typically >400 km/s), which is much faster than the propagation speed of AIC waves relative to the plasma (the Alfvén speed, typically <100 km/s).
2.  **"Frozen-in" Flow:** Because of this high-speed flow, the AIC waves are essentially "frozen" into the plasma and are carried, or convected, past the stationary spacecraft by the solar wind.
3.  **Apparent Direction of Propagation:** The solar wind flows predominantly in the radial direction (away from the Sun). Therefore, from the perspective of a fixed spacecraft at L1, the wave structures appear to be propagating along the radial line. The temporal variations measured by the spacecraft are dominated by the Doppler shift caused by these spatial structures being swept by.
4.  **Helicity Calculation:** Normalized magnetic helicity is a measure of polarization in the plane *perpendicular* to the wave's propagation vector. Since the *apparent* direction of propagation as seen by the spacecraft is radial, it is a valid and common practice to use the plane perpendicular to the radial direction for the calculation. In a standard coordinate system where the X-axis is radial, this perpendicular plane is the Y-Z plane.

In summary, while AIC waves physically propagate along the local magnetic field, the overwhelming speed of the radial solar wind at L1 makes the *observed* propagation direction radial. Therefore, analyzing the polarization (helicity) in the plane perpendicular to the radial direction is a well-justified approximation based on Taylor's Hypothesis.
