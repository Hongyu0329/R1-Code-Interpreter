    "To calculate the sum of the symmetry factors for each second-order vacuum bubble diagram in $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the relevant Feynman diagrams.**\n\nThe theory is the scalar field theory with a Lagrangian containing an interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$.\n*   **\"Second-order\"** means the diagrams are proportional to $\\lambda^2$, which implies they must contain exactly two interaction vertices.\n*   **\"Vacuum bubble\"** means the diagrams have no external lines. All field lines (propagators) must begin and end at vertices within the diagram.\n*   We are interested in **connected** diagrams, as per the linked-cluster theorem for vacuum-to-vacuum transitions.\n\nWith two vertices, each having four legs from the $\\phi^4$ interaction, we have a total of 8 legs to connect with propagators. There are two and only two distinct ways to form a connected diagram:\n\n1.  **The \"8-Diagram\" (or \"Sunset Diagram\"):** All four legs from the first vertex connect directly to the four legs of the second vertex. This forms a diagram with two vertices joined by four parallel propagators, resembling the number 8 on its side.\n\n2.  **The \"Double-Scoop Diagram\":** At the first vertex, two legs connect to each other, forming a self-loop. The other two legs connect to the second vertex. At the second vertex, two legs are already connected to the first vertex, so the remaining two legs must also connect to each other, forming a second self-loop. This diagram has two vertices connected by two propagators, with each vertex also having one self-loop.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the symmetry factor for the \"8-Diagram\" (S₁).**\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group. This is the number of ways one can permute the internal lines and vertices without changing the diagram's structure.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Vertex Permutations.** The two vertices are indistinguishable. They are both of the same type ($\\phi^4$ interaction) and have an identical configuration of lines connected to them. Therefore, we can swap the two vertices, which gives a symmetry factor of **2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Propagator Permutations.** There are four propagators connecting the two vertices. These propagators are identical and can be interchanged freely without altering the diagram. The number of ways to permute these four lines is $4! = 24$. This gives a symmetry factor of **24**.\n\nCombining these symmetries, the total symmetry factor for the \"8-diagram\" is the product of these factors:\n$S_1 = (\\text{Vertex Permutations}) \\times (\\text{Propagator Permutations}) = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the symmetry factor for the \"Double-Scoop Diagram\" (S₂).**\n\nWe apply the same principles to the second diagram.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Vertex Permutations.** Each vertex in this diagram has one self-loop and is connected to the other vertex by two propagators. Since both vertices have the same structure, they are indistinguishable and can be swapped. This exchange also swaps the two self-loops. This gives a symmetry factor of **2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Propagator Permutations.** There are two propagators connecting the two vertices. These two lines are topologically equivalent and can be interchanged. This gives a symmetry factor of **2**. The two self-loop propagators are also interchanged when the vertices are swapped, which is already accounted for in the vertex permutation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Loop Orientation.** A self-loop propagator starts and ends on the same vertex. It connects two of the four field legs at the vertex. A propagator line is undirected, but one can consider the two \"ends\" of the propagator where it attaches to the vertex. Swapping these two ends is a symmetry. This \"flipping\" of the loop is a valid automorphism. Since there are two such self-loops in the diagram (one on each vertex), and each can be independently \"flipped\", we get a symmetry factor of **2** for the first loop and another factor of **2** for the second loop.\n\nCombining all these independent symmetries, the total symmetry factor for the \"double-scoop diagram\" is:\n$S_2 = (\\text{Vertex Permutations}) \\times (\\text{Connecting Propagator Permutations}) \\times (\\text{Loop 1 Flip}) \\times (\\text{Loop 2 Flip}) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the symmetry factors.**\n\nThe question asks for the sum of the symmetry factors of all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\n\nTotal Sum = $S_1 + S_2$\nTotal Sum = $48 + 16$\nTotal Sum = $64$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is calculated by summing the individual symmetry factors.\n\n$S_1 = 48$\n$S_2 = 16$\nSum = $S_1 + S_2 = 48 + 16 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
