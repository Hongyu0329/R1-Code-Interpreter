    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand the Rule: Trisyllabic Laxing**\nTrisyllabic laxing (or shortening) is a historical sound change in English. The rule states that a long vowel or a diphthong becomes a short vowel when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word. This typically happens when a suffix is added to a base word.\n*   **Example:** `sane` (/seɪn/, with a long vowel) + `-ity` → `sanity` (/'sæn.ɪ.ti/). The vowel is now in the third syllable from the end and shortens to /æ/.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Base Word:** `south` (/saʊθ/). This has a long diphthong [aʊ].\n    *   **Derived Word:** `southern` (/'sʌð.ərn/). The vowel sound changes to the short vowel [ʌ].\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Two syllables (`south-ern`).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Although vowel shortening has occurred, the word is only two syllables long. Therefore, this cannot be *trisyllabic* laxing, as that rule specifically requires three or more syllables.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Base Word:** `derive` (/dɪ'raɪv/). This has a long diphthong [aɪ].\n    *   **Derived Word:** `derivative` (/dɪ.'rɪv.ə.tɪv/). The vowel sound changes to the short vowel [ɪ].\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Four syllables. The relevant syllable `-riv-` is the antepenultimate (third from the end).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a perfect example of trisyllabic laxing. The long vowel in `derive` shortens when the suffixes `-at-ive` are added, making it a longer word where the vowel is in the correct position.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Base Word:** `serene` (/sə'riːn/). This has a long vowel [iː].\n    *   **Derived Word:** `serenity` (/sə.'rɛn.ɪ.ti/). The vowel sound changes to the short vowel [ɛ].\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Four syllables. The relevant syllable `-ren-` is the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is another classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Base Word:** `please` (/pliːz/). This has a long vowel [iː].\n    *   **Derived Word:** `pleasant` (/'plɛz.ənt/). The vowel sound changes to the short vowel [ɛ].\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Two syllables (`pleas-ant`).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Like `southern`, this word shows vowel shortening before a suffix, but it is not an example of *trisyllabic* laxing because the word is only two syllables long.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Related Base Word:** `grate` (/ɡreɪt/, as in `grateful`). This has a long diphthong [eɪ].\n    *   **Derived Word:** `gratitude` (/'ɡræt.ɪ.tjuːd/). The vowel sound is the short vowel [æ].\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Three syllables (`grat-i-tude`). The relevant syllable `grat-` is the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This fits the rule for trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Etymology:** The word comes from Old English `sceadu`. The first vowel in this word was historically short. It is related to the word `shade` (/ʃeɪd/, which has a long vowel), but `shadow` is not derived from `shade` by adding a suffix.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `shadow` (/'ʃæ.doʊ/). The first vowel [æ] is short.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Two syllables (`shad-ow`).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This word is only two syllables, so it cannot undergo trisyllabic laxing. More importantly, the vowel in its first syllable was never long and then shortened. It has been historically short. Therefore, no vowel laxing or shortening process has occurred at all.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n*   `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` **have** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` have undergone a type of vowel shortening, but not specifically *trisyllabic* laxing because they are not three syllables long.\n*   `shadow` is only two syllables long and, critically, its first vowel was never long to begin with, so it never underwent any kind of shortening or laxing process from a long-vowel base.\n\nTherefore, `shadow` is the word that has not undergone the sound change of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
