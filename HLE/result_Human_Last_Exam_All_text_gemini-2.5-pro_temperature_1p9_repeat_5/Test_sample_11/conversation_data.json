    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify the *first statute* enacted in the *modern State of Israel* (i.e., after its establishment in 1948) that *explicitly introduced* the legal *concept of \"good faith\"*. The answer should be the name of the statute only, without the word \"the\" or its year of enactment.\n\n**2. Understanding the Legal-Historical Context:**\nBefore the 1970s, Israeli private law was a mix of legal systems, primarily based on Ottoman law and English common law, which were absorbed during the British Mandate. English common law traditionally does not have a general, overarching duty of \"good faith\" in the same way as civil law systems. A major legislative project in Israel, starting in the late 1960s and continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, aimed to create an original, modern, and codified body of Israeli civil law. The introduction of \"good faith\" as a core principle was a key part of this reform.\n\n**3. Identifying Prominent Candidates:**\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This is the most famous statute associated with \"good faith\" (*tom lev* in Hebrew) in Israeli law. Its Sections 12 and 39 established good faith as a fundamental, or \"super,\" principle governing all contractual negotiations and the performance of all contractual obligations. For many, this law represents the true \"introduction\" of the concept as a broad standard of conduct into Israeli law. However, the question is about the *first* statute chronologically.\n\n**4. Searching for Earlier Statutes:**\nA chronological investigation reveals several statutes that explicitly used the term \"good faith\" before the 1973 Contracts Law.\n*   **Land Law, 1969:** This law uses the term \"good faith\" in sections concerning conflicting transactions (Section 9) and the acquisition of rights in registered land (Section 10). Here, it refers to the state of mind of a purchaser (a bona fide purchaser).\n*   **Defamation Law, 1965:** This law is an original Israeli statute. It establishes \"good faith\" as a key condition for several legal defenses against a claim of defamation (Sections 15 and 16).\n*   **Careful Point:** Both the Land Law and Defamation Law predate the famous Contracts Law. The Defamation Law is the earlier of these two.\n\n**5. Searching for the Earliest Statute:**\nAn even deeper search into Israel's early legislative history reveals an earlier instance.\n*   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This is an official Knesset statute that created a consolidated, new Hebrew version of the British Mandatory Bills of Exchange Ordinance.\n    *   This statute explicitly uses the concept of \"good faith.\" For instance, it defines a \"holder in due course\" as someone who takes a bill, among other things, \"in good faith\".\n    *   Crucially, the ordinance provides a specific definition: \"A thing is deemed to be done in good faith, within the meaning of this Ordinance, where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not.\"\n    *   This statute, enacted in 1957, predates the Defamation Law (1965), the Land Law (1969), and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973).\n\n**6. Final Analysis and Conclusion:**\n*   **Careful Point - What does \"introduce\" mean?** While one could argue that the Contracts Law of 1973 \"introduced\" good faith as a broad, objective principle, or that the Defamation Law of 1965 was the first *original* Israeli law to do so, the question asks for the \"first statute\".\n*   The **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957** is a statute passed by the Knesset of the modern State of Israel. It is the earliest such statute found that explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" and gives it legal effect and definition. Therefore, based on a literal and chronological interpretation, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance>>>"
