    "An analysis of the question is provided below, step by step, including careful points to consider.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points of the differential equation.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$$\nEquilibrium points (also called critical points or fixed points) are the constant solutions to the differential equation. They occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. Let the right-hand side of the equation be denoted by $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to find the roots of $f(x)=0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis, $x^2 - 2x + 1$, is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are found by setting each factor to zero:\n- $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n- $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nThe equilibrium points of the system are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x_c$, we can use the first derivative test. We compute the derivative of $f(x)$ and evaluate its sign at each equilibrium point.\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\nThe derivative is:\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\nThe stability is determined as follows:\n- If $f'(x_c) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x_c$ is stable (asymptotically stable).\n- If $f'(x_c) > 0$, the equilibrium point $x_c$ is unstable.\n- If $f'(x_c) = 0$, the test is inconclusive.\n\nLet's test our equilibrium points:\n\n*   **For $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive for $x=1$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** When the first derivative test is inconclusive, it's often because the root of $f(x)=0$ has a multiplicity greater than 1. Here, $x=1$ is a double root. We must use another method to determine stability.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability for the inconclusive case ($x=1$).**\nWe can analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$. The sign of $f(x) = x'(t)$ tells us the direction of the solution flow.\nOur function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n*   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x \\in (0,1)$):\n    The term $-x$ is negative.\n    The term $(x-1)^2$ is positive.\n    So, $f(x) = (-)(+) = \\text{negative}$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so solutions starting to the left of 1 move away from 1.\n*   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x > 1$):\n    The term $-x$ is negative.\n    The term $(x-1)^2$ is positive.\n    So, $f(x) = (-)(+) = \\text{negative}$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so solutions starting to the right of 1 move towards 1.\n\nAn equilibrium point that is stable from one side and unstable from the other is called **semi-stable**.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** In the context of stability, a \"stable\" equilibrium usually means Lyapunov stable (or often asymptotically stable). A semi-stable point is not Lyapunov stable because for any small neighborhood around it, there are starting points from which the solution will eventually leave that neighborhood (in this case, points starting to the left of 1). Therefore, semi-stable points are not counted as stable.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibria.**\nFrom our analysis:\n- $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n- $x=1$ is a semi-stable equilibrium point (hence, not stable).\n\nThe number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final result.**\nThe problem asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value $m=1$ we found:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
