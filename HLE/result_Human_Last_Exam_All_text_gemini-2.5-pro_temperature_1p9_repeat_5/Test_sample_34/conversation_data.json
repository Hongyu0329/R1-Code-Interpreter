    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Game Conditions:**\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in No-Limit Hold'em. You act last on every post-flop street, giving you a significant informational advantage. This allows you to open-raise a very wide range of hands.\n    *   **Stack Depth:** 100 Big Blinds (BB). This is a standard stack depth, where implied odds (the ability to win a big pot with speculative hands) and post-flop playability are very important.\n    *   **Game Type:** Rake-free cash game. The absence of rake is a crucial detail. Rake is the fee the house takes from each pot, which slightly reduces the expected value (EV) of playing any given hand. Without rake, the threshold for a hand to be profitably opened is lower. This means our opening range should be even wider than it would be in a standard raked game.\n    *   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard open-raise size from late position.\n\n2.  **Identify the Candidate Hands:**\n    The question asks for the \"worst suited jack\". This means we need to evaluate and rank all possible suited Jack-X hands. These are:\n    *   JTs (Jack-Ten suited)\n    *   J9s (Jack-Nine suited)\n    *   J8s (Jack-Eight suited)\n    *   J7s (Jack-Seven suited)\n    *   J6s (Jack-Six suited)\n    *   J5s (Jack-Five suited)\n    *   J4s (Jack-Four suited)\n    *   J3s (Jack-Three suited)\n    *   J2s (Jack-Two suited)\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Hands Based on Poker Principles:**\n    We evaluate hands based on a few key properties:\n    *   **High Card Strength:** All these hands have a Jack, which is a strong card that can make a strong top pair.\n    *   **Suitedness:** All these hands are suited, giving them the ability to make flushes, which are very powerful hands. Suitedness also provides backdoor flush equity.\n    *   **Connectivity:** This refers to how close the two cards are in rank, which determines their ability to make straights. Closer cards are better.\n    *   **Kicker Strength:** The \"kicker\" is the lower of the two cards. It becomes important when you and your opponent have the same pair. A better kicker wins the pot.\n\n4.  **Rank the Candidate Hands:**\n    Let's rank the suited Jacks from best to worst based on the principles above.\n    *   **JTs:** The best. It is a connector (no gap), meaning it has the highest potential to make a straight (e.g., with a Q-K-A or 9-8-7 flop). It also has the highest kicker.\n    *   **J9s:** Excellent hand. It's a \"one-gapper,\" so its straight potential is slightly lower than JTs, but still very high.\n    *   **J8s, J7s:** Good hands. As the gap between the Jack and the kicker increases, the straight potential diminishes. However, these are still strong hands to open from the button due to their flush potential and high card value.\n    *   **J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest suited Jacks. Their straight potential is significantly reduced. Their value comes mostly from making a flush or a pair of Jacks. Among these, the main differentiator is the kicker. J6s is better than J5s, which is better than J4s, and so on. The hand with the worst connectivity and the lowest kicker is **J2s**.\n\n5.  **Determine if the Worst Hand Should Still Be Opened:**\n    The question asks for the worst suited jack you *should open*. This implies the hand is part of a standard, profitable opening range. Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers have shown that in a 100BB, rake-free game, the button's opening range is extremely wide (often around 50% of all hands). This range definitely includes all suited Jacks. The marginal profit from opening hands like J3s and J2s comes from the combination of position, fold equity (the blinds folding pre-flop), and the potential to hit a strong hand like a flush or two pair. Given the rake-free environment, even the weakest of these, J2s, is a profitable open-raise.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy ranking all suited Jack combinations, we find that the strength decreases as the kicker gets lower and the connectivity worsens. J2s has the lowest kicker and the largest gap, making it the least powerful hand in the group. However, due to the immense advantage of playing from the button in a rake-free game, even this \"worst\" suited Jack is a standard, profitable hand to open-raise.\n\nTherefore, the worst suited jack you should open is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
