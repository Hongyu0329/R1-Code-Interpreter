    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nFirst, we must break down the key parameters of the question:\n*   **Ship Nationality:** French.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n*   **Time Period:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This means the relevant timeframe is from the French declaration of war on Germany (3 September 1939) until 21 June 1940.\n*   **Size Criterion:** Largest by displacement. For merchant ships, this is typically measured in Gross Register Tons (GRT). For warships, it is measured in tons of displacement (weight). We must consider both types of ships.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates (Warships)\nNext, we will check for any large French warships sunk by U-boats within the specified timeframe.\n*   Major French naval combatants included battleships (like the *Dunkerque* or *Bretagne* classes), aircraft carriers (*Béarn*), heavy cruisers, and light cruisers.\n*   A search of French naval losses from September 1939 to June 1940 reveals that no French battleship, aircraft carrier, or cruiser was sunk by a U-boat.\n*   The primary naval losses to U-boats in this period were much smaller vessels:\n    *   The submarine **Doris** (630 tons displacement) was sunk by U-9 on 9 May 1940.\n*   Other major French naval losses in this period were due to other causes (e.g., the destroyer *Jaguar* was sunk by German E-boats, and the destroyer *Bison* was sunk by aircraft). The battleship *Bretagne* was famously sunk at Mers-el-Kébir, but this was by the British Royal Navy on 3 July 1940, *after* the armistice.\n*   Therefore, the largest warship sunk was only a few hundred tons, making it highly likely that the answer is a merchant vessel.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Potential Candidates (Merchant Ships)\nNow, we must search for large French merchant ships sunk by U-boats before the armistice.\n*   **S/S *Bretagne***: A passenger/cargo liner of **10,108 GRT**. She was sunk on 14 October 1939 by U-45.\n*   **S/S *Franche-Comté***: A cargo liner of **10,950 GRT**. It was part of the same convoy as the *Bretagne* (Convoy KJF-3), damaged by U-45 on 14 October 1939 and finally sunk by U-48 on 27 October 1939.\n*   **S/T *Sheherazade***: A large oil tanker of **13,467 GRT**. She was sunk on 21 June 1940, just one day before the armistice was signed, by the famous U-boat U-47 commanded by Günther Prien.\n\n### Step 4: Compare Candidates and Final Conclusion\nLet's compare the largest vessels identified:\n*   Warship: Submarine *Doris* (~630 tons).\n*   Merchant Ship: *Bretagne* (10,108 GRT).\n*   Merchant Ship: *Franche-Comté* (10,950 GRT).\n*   Merchant Ship: *Sheherazade* (13,467 GRT).\n\nThe largest vessel by a significant margin is the oil tanker *Sheherazade*. Her sinking occurred on 21 June 1940, which falls squarely within the \"before the 1940 armistice\" timeframe. The sinking agent was a U-boat (U-47), and her tonnage (13,467 GRT) makes her the largest French vessel sunk under these specific conditions.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **The Armistice Date:** The Armistice of 22 June 1940 is the critical cutoff date. Events after this, such as the sinking of the battleship *Bretagne* by the British, are not relevant.\n2.  **The Cause of Loss:** The loss must be attributable to a U-boat, not to mines, aircraft, surface ships, or scuttling.\n3.  **Tonnage vs. Displacement:** While GRT (a measure of volume) and displacement (a measure of weight) are different, GRT is the standard metric for comparing the size of merchant ships. Given the vast difference in size between the largest merchant candidates and the only naval candidates, the ship with the highest GRT is undisputedly the \"largest\" ship that fits the criteria.\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker *Sheherazade*.\n\n<<<The oil tanker Sheherazade>>>"
