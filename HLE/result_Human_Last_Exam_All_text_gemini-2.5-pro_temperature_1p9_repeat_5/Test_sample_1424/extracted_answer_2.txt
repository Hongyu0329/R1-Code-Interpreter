The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$ is that of an inverse linear relationship, where $\epsilon_k$ determines the location of the pole of the Green's function. Specifically, in the frequency domain, $G_0(k, \omega)$ is proportional to $[\omega - (\epsilon_k - \mu)]^{-1}$, where $\omega$ is the frequency and $\mu$ is the chemical potential.
