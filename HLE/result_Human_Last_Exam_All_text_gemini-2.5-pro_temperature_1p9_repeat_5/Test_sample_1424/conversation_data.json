    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) in the Path Integral Formalism\n\nThe Feynman path integral formalism is a powerful method to study quantum systems, particularly in quantum field theory and many-body physics. In this context, the Green's function (or propagator) describes the propagation of a particle (or excitation) from one spacetime point to another.\n\nThe \"bare\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a **non-interacting** system. The system's dynamics are governed by a Hamiltonian, $H_0$, that contains only single-particle terms (kinetic energy, external potential) and no particle-particle interaction terms.\n\nIn the path integral formalism using Grassmann fields ($\\psi, \\bar{\\psi}$) for fermions, the Green's function is defined as the two-point correlation function:\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\langle T[\\psi(x,t) \\psi^\\dagger(x',t')] \\rangle_0$\nwhere $T$ is the time-ordering operator and the expectation value $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ is calculated using a path integral with the non-interacting action, $S_0$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)\n\nThe path integral is weighted by $e^{iS}$ (in real time) or $e^{-S}$ (in imaginary time). The action $S_0$ for a non-interacting system is quadratic in the fields. It's most convenient to work in the basis of single-particle energy eigenstates. Let's label these states by a quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum), with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nIn this basis, the non-interacting Hamiltonian is $H_0 = \\sum_k (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_k^\\dagger c_k$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential and $c_k^\\dagger, c_k$ are creation/annihilation operators. The corresponding action in the imaginary-time (Matsubara) formalism is:\n\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\nwhere $\\tau$ is imaginary time, $\\beta = 1/k_B T$, and $\\psi_k, \\bar{\\psi}_k$ are Grassmann fields for the state $k$.\n\n### Step 3: Diagonalize the Action with a Fourier Transform\n\nThe action becomes even simpler if we transform from the imaginary-time domain ($\\tau$) to the Matsubara frequency domain ($i\\omega_n$). The fields are expanded as:\n$\\psi_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\psi_k(i\\omega_n)$\n\nSubstituting this into the action, the derivative $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes completely diagonal in both $k$ and $n$:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k, n} \\bar{\\psi}_k(i\\omega_n) (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k(i\\omega_n)$\n\nThis is the standard form of a quadratic action in the momentum-frequency domain.\n\n### Step 4: Derive the Green's Function by Inverting the Action Kernel\n\nA key result from Gaussian path integrals is that for an action of the form $S = \\sum \\bar{\\psi} A \\psi$, the two-point correlation function (i.e., the Green's function) is simply the inverse of the kernel $A$.\n\nFrom the action in Step 3, we can identify the kernel for each independent mode $(k, n)$ as:\n$A(k, n) = (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu)$\n\nThe bare Green's function in Matsubara frequency space, $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$, is the inverse of this kernel:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = A(k,n)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu}$\n\nOr, written more conventionally:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Functional Dependence\n\nFrom the final expression above, we can state the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n1.  **Inverse Proportionality**: For a fixed frequency ($\\omega_n$) and chemical potential ($\\mu$), the Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, it takes the form $G_0 \\propto (C - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, where $C = i\\omega_n + \\mu$ is a constant.\n\n2.  **Pole Structure**: The most important aspect of this dependence is that the **single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ determine the location of the poles of the Green's function**. In the imaginary frequency formalism, the pole for a given state $k$ lies at $i\\omega_n = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$.\n\n3.  **Real-Frequency Formalism (Careful Point)**: To obtain the real-time Feynman Green's function, one performs an analytic continuation from the discrete Matsubara frequencies to the continuous real frequency axis, $i\\omega_n \\to \\omega$. This procedure introduces an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\eta$, to ensure causality. The result is:\n    $G_0^F(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n    In this form, the functional dependence is preserved. The single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$ directly sets the real part of the pole's position in the complex frequency plane. This pole at $\\omega \\approx \\epsilon_k - \\mu$ signifies a long-lived excitation (infinitely long-lived in the non-interacting case) with energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n*   **Bare vs. Full Green's Function**: The analysis applies to the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$), which corresponds to a non-interacting system described by a quadratic action. In an interacting system, the full Green's function ($G$) has a more complex structure, where the simple pole at $\\epsilon_k$ is typically shifted and broadened.\n*   **Choice of Formalism**: The functional form is clearest in the frequency domain (either Matsubara or real).\n*   **The Role of $\\epsilon_k$**: The single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is not just an arbitrary parameter; it fundamentally defines the excitation spectrum of the non-interacting system and, consequently, sets the pole structure of its propagator.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, after Fourier transforming to the frequency-momentum domain, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is found by inverting the kernel of the quadratic action. The resulting functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is that $\\epsilon_k$ sets the location of the simple pole of the Green's function. In the real-frequency representation, the expression is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nThis shows that $G_0$ is an inverse linear function of $\\epsilon_k$. Physically, the energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ of the non-interacting Hamiltonian dictate the energies at which single-particle excitations can propagate.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is that of an inverse linear relationship, where $\\epsilon_k$ determines the location of the pole of the Green's function. Specifically, in the frequency domain, $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is proportional to $[\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)]^{-1}$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.>>>"
