    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Subject:** Two Nobel laureates.\n    *   **Context:** An infamous commercial.\n    *   **Company:** Enron.\n    *   **Year:** 2000.\n    *   **Specific Detail:** The tagline \"Ask Why\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major corporate branding initiative by Enron in 2000. It aimed to portray the company not just as an energy trader but as a sophisticated, innovative, and intellectual powerhouse that was changing markets. The campaign used both television commercials and print advertisements.\n\n3.  **Identify the Participants:** The print ad component of the campaign featured several prominent thinkers. The goal was to lend intellectual credibility to the Enron brand. The question specifically asks for the two participants who were Nobel laureates.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Laureate:** One of the individuals featured was **Merton Miller**.\n    *   **Credentials:** He was a highly respected economist from the University of Chicago.\n    *   **Nobel Prize:** He was a co-recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 for his work on capital structure (the Modigliani-Miller theorem).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since he won his Nobel in 1990, he was unequivocally a Nobel laureate at the time the commercial ran in 2000.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Second Laureate:** The other well-known economist featured in the campaign was **Paul Krugman**.\n    *   **Credentials:** At the time, he was a prominent professor of economics (at MIT, moving to Princeton in 2000) and an influential columnist for *The New York Times*.\n    *   **Nobel Prize:** He won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his work on New Trade Theory and New Economic Geography.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most important nuance. Paul Krugman was *not* a Nobel laureate in 2000 when the ad was published. He became one eight years later. However, the question is typically answered in retrospect, and he is the other figure in the ads who holds the title of \"Nobel laureate.\" Both men later expressed regret for their participation given the massive fraud that Enron was revealed to be.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The two individuals, both winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, who were featured in Enron's \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign are Merton Miller and Paul Krugman, with the noted caveat that Krugman received his prize after the ad was published.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
