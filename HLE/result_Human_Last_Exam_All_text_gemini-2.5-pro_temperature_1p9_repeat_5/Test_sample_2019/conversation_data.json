    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n1.  **Board:** A 5x5 grid. The \"toroidal\" nature means the board wraps around on all sides. For a coordinate `(r, c)`, the rows adjacent to `r` are `(r-1) mod 5` and `(r+1) mod 5`. The same applies to columns.\n2.  **Pieces:** 4 identical queens.\n3.  **Constraint:** The queens must be \"non-attacking\". On a toroidal board, a queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a queen at `(r2, c2)` if any of these conditions are met:\n    *   **Same Row:** `r1 = r2`\n    *   **Same Column:** `c1 = c2`\n    *   **Same Diagonal:** `(r1 - r2) ≡ (c1 - c2) (mod 5)`\n    *   **Same Anti-diagonal:** `(r1 - r2) ≡ -(c1 - c2) (mod 5)`\n\nThe goal is to find the total number of valid configurations of 4 queens. Since the queens are identical, the order of placement does not matter.\n\n### Method 1: Fixing one Queen\n\nThis method leverages the high degree of symmetry on the toroidal board.\n\n1.  **Place the First Queen:** On a toroidal board, all 25 squares are equivalent. We can place the first queen, Q1, at any square and multiply the result by the total number of squares, then divide by the number of queens to correct for overcounting. Let's place Q1 at `(0, 0)`.\n\n2.  **Identify Attacked Squares:** Q1 at `(0, 0)` attacks all squares `(r, c)` where:\n    *   `r=0` (4 squares)\n    *   `c=0` (4 squares)\n    *   `r = c (mod 5)` (4 squares: `(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)`)\n    *   `r = -c (mod 5)` (4 squares: `(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)`)\n    Including `(0,0)` itself, a total of `1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17` squares are attacked.\n\n3.  **Identify Available Squares:** There are `25 - 17 = 8` squares available for the other three queens. Let's call this set of squares `S`. By checking all coordinates not attacked by `(0,0)`, we find:\n    `S = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3)}`\n\n4.  **Place the Remaining Three Queens:** We need to find the number of ways to place 3 non-attacking queens on these 8 squares. This means we must find all 3-element subsets of `S` where no two queens attack each other. Let's call this number `N_fixed`, the number of solutions containing a queen at `(0,0)`.\n\n5.  **Analyze Attacks within S:** Let's model the attacks within `S` as a graph where the vertices are the 8 squares and an edge connects two squares if they attack each other.\n    *   Let's choose a square from `S`, say Q2 = `(1,2)`.\n    *   Which squares in `S` does `(1,2)` attack?\n        *   Row 1: `(1,3)`\n        *   Column 2: `(4,2)`\n        *   Diagonal (`r-c = -1 mod 5`): `(3,4)`\n        *   Anti-diagonal (`r+c = 3 mod 5`): `(2,1)`\n    *   So, if we pick `(1,2)` as one of our queens, we cannot pick any from `{(1,3), (4,2), (3,4), (2,1)}`.\n    *   This leaves the remaining squares for Q3 and Q4 as `S_rem = S \\ {(1,2), (1,3), (4,2), (3,4), (2,1)} = {(2,4), (3,1), (4,3)}`.\n\n6.  **Complete the Solution:** We need to select 2 non-attacking queens from `S_rem = {(2,4), (3,1), (4,3)}`. Let's check for attacks between these three squares:\n    *   `(2,4)` vs `(3,1)`: No attack.\n    *   `(2,4)` vs `(4,3)`: No attack.\n    *   `(3,1)` vs `(4,3)`: No attack.\n    The set `S_rem` is an \"independent set\" in the attack graph; all three queens are mutually non-attacking. Therefore, we can choose any 2 queens from this set of 3. The number of ways is `C(3,2) = 3`.\n\n7.  **Count All Solutions with Q1 at (0,0):**\n    *   We started by choosing Q2 = `(1,2)` from `S`, which led to 3 ways to complete the solution.\n    *   The set `S` is highly symmetric. Choosing any other square from `S` as Q2 will also lead to 3 ways to complete the solution.\n    *   There are 8 choices for the first queen from `S` (our Q2). Each choice leads to `C(3,2)=3` ways to choose the remaining two queens.\n    *   This appears to give `8 * 3 = 24` configurations. However, this counts ordered choices. We want to count the number of 3-element sets. Since each valid 3-element set `T = {q1, q2, q3}` will be found when we start with `q1`, `q2`, or `q3`, we have counted each set 3 times.\n    *   So, the number of non-attacking 3-queen sets in `S` is `(8 * 3) / 3 = 8`.\n    *   This means `N_fixed = 8`. There are 8 ways to complete the set if we fix one queen at `(0,0)`.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Total Number of Ways:**\n    *   The number of solutions containing one specific queen (e.g., at `(0,0)`) is 8.\n    *   By symmetry, we can scale this up to the whole board.\n    *   Total Ways = (Number of solutions with Q1 at a fixed spot) * (Total squares) / (Number of queens)\n    *   Total Ways = `8 * 25 / 4`\n    *   Total Ways = `2 * 25 = 50`.\n\n### Method 2: The Permutation Method\n\nThis method offers a different perspective and serves as a good cross-check.\n\n1.  **Occupied and Empty Squares:** Placing 4 queens on a 5x5 board leaves exactly one row and one column empty.\n2.  **Count by Empty Squares:** We can count the configurations by first choosing the empty row and the empty column.\n    *   Number of ways to choose the empty row: 5.\n    *   Number of ways to choose the empty column: 5.\n    *   Total ways to specify the `4x4` subgrid of occupied rows/columns: `5 * 5 = 25`.\n3.  **Permutation Problem:** For a fixed set of 4 rows `R` and 4 columns `C`, a solution is a permutation (a bijection) `p: R -> C` such that the set of 4 queens `{(r, p(r)) | r ∈ R}` is non-attacking.\n4.  **Conditions for a Valid Permutation:** The non-attacking conditions translate to:\n    *   `p(r) - r (mod 5)` must be distinct for all `r ∈ R`.\n    *   `p(r) + r (mod 5)` must be distinct for all `r ∈ R`.\n5.  **Test Case:** Let's choose the empty row to be 4 and the empty column to be 4. So, `R = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and `C = {0, 1, 2, 3}`. We need to find the number of permutations `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3}` that satisfy the conditions. There are `4! = 24` total permutations to check.\n    *   **Example 1: p = (1,3,0,2)**.\n        *   `p-r (mod 5)`: `{1-0, 3-1, 0-2, 2-3} = {1, 2, -2, -1} = {1, 2, 3, 4}`. All distinct.\n        *   `p+r (mod 5)`: `{1+0, 3+1, 0+2, 2+3} = {1, 4, 2, 0}`. All distinct.\n        *   This is a valid solution.\n    *   **Example 2: p = (2,0,3,1)**.\n        *   `p-r (mod 5)`: `{2-0, 0-1, 3-2, 1-3} = {2, -1, 1, -2} = {2, 4, 1, 3}`. All distinct.\n        *   `p+r (mod 5)`: `{2+0, 0+1, 3+2, 1+3} = {2, 1, 0, 4}`. All distinct.\n        *   This is a valid solution.\n    *   A full, careful check of all 24 permutations shows that these are the only two valid permutations for this choice of R and C.\n\n6.  **Symmetry Argument:** The number of valid permutations, 2, is the same regardless of which row and column are chosen as empty. This is due to the translational symmetry of the toroidal board. Any choice of 4 rows and 4 columns is equivalent to the `{0,1,2,3}` case after a suitable shift (translation) of the coordinate system.\n7.  **Calculate Total Ways:**\n    *   Number of ways to choose the `4x4` grid (by choosing the empty row/col): 25.\n    *   Number of valid queen placements (permutations) for each grid: 2.\n    *   Total Ways = `25 * 2 = 50`.\n\nBoth methods confirm that there are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard."
