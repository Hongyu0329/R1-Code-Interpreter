    "This problem asks for the computation of the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of simplicial volume and the objects involved.**\n\n*   **$\\Sigma_g$**: This denotes an oriented, closed surface of genus $g$. It is a sphere with $g$ handles attached.\n*   **Simplicial Volume ($||\\cdot||$)**: Introduced by M. Gromov, the simplicial volume of a closed, oriented manifold $M$ is a topological invariant that measures the minimal \"complexity\" of its fundamental class in terms of singular simplices.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface $\\Sigma_g$.**\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_g$ depends on its genus $g$.\n*   If $g=0$, $\\Sigma_0$ is the sphere $S^2$. Its simplicial volume is $||S^2||=0$.\n*   If $g=1$, $\\Sigma_1$ is the torus $T^2$. Its simplicial volume is $||T^2||=0$. This is because the torus admits a fixed-point-free circle action.\n*   If $g \\ge 2$, $\\Sigma_g$ is a hyperbolic surface. Its simplicial volume is non-zero and is related to its Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$. The formula is:\n    $||\\Sigma_g|| = -2\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = -2(2-2g) = 4g-4$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the simplicial volume of each component surface.**\n\nWe are given two surfaces: $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n*   For the first surface, $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, we can use the formula for hyperbolic surfaces.\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4g_1 - 4 = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n\n*   For the second surface, $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, this is also a hyperbolic surface.\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4g_2 - 4 = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n**Step 4: Recall the product formula for simplicial volume.**\n\nFor two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ (of dimension $m$) and $N$ (of dimension $n$), the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is given by Gromov's product formula:\n$||M \\times N|| = C_{m,n} \\cdot ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$\nwhere $C_{m,n}$ is the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m+n}{m} = \\frac{(m+n)!}{m!n!}$.\n\nA careful point here is not to forget the combinatorial coefficient $C_{m,n}$.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the product formula to $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.**\n\n*   Our manifolds are $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   The dimension of $M$ is $m=2$.\n*   The dimension of $N$ is $n=2$.\n*   First, we calculate the coefficient $C_{2,2}$:\n    $C_{2,2} = \\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6$.\n*   Now, we substitute the values from Step 3 and the coefficient into the product formula:\n    $||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = C_{2,2} \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the final numerical value.**\n\n*   $6 \\cdot 120 = 720$.\n*   $720 \\cdot 64 = 46080$.\n\nSo, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 46080.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe calculation is as follows:\n1.  The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g \\ge 2$ is given by $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4g-4$.\n2.  The simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31}$ is $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31)-4 = 124-4=120$.\n3.  The simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{17}$ is $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17)-4 = 68-4=64$.\n4.  The simplicial volume of a product of manifolds $M^m$ and $N^n$ is given by Gromov's product formula: $||M \\times N|| = \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n5.  In our case, $m=n=2$, so the binomial coefficient is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n6.  Therefore, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is $6 \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\n<<<46080>>>"
