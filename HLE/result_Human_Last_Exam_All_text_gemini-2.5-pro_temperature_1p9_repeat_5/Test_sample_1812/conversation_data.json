    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe main task is to compute the determinant of the matrix A.\nThe problem provides:\n- The matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n- Additional context: The matrix is described as the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided Information**\n*   **The Matrix A:** This is a 3x3 symmetric matrix. Our primary goal is to find its determinant.\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Contextual Information.** The terms \"Markov quiver\" and the condition \"\\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" might be confusing. However, the matrix A is explicitly given with constant integer entries. The determinant of a constant matrix is a constant value. Therefore, this value does not depend on any external parameters like \\( m_{1/2} \\). This extra information is not required for the calculation and can be considered extraneous for the purpose of finding the determinant of the given matrix A. The matrix A itself is sometimes called the Cartan matrix for the A2 affine Lie algebra, or the Laplacian matrix of the complete graph K3.\n\n**3. Method 1: Direct Calculation using Cofactor Expansion**\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\) is given by the formula:\ndet = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).\n\nFor our matrix A:\n- a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n- d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n- g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n*   det(A) = 2 * ( (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) - (-1) * ( (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) + (-1) * ( (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) )\n*   det(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 - (-2))\n*   det(A) = 2 * (3) + 1 * (-3) - 1 * (1 + 2)\n*   det(A) = 6 - 3 - 1 * (3)\n*   det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\n*   det(A) = 0\n\n**4. Method 2: Using Properties of the Matrix**\nThis method is often quicker and provides a good check.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Observe the relationship between rows/columns.** Let's sum the elements of each row:\n    *   Sum of Row 1: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\n    *   Sum of Row 2: (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0\n    *   Sum of Row 3: (-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0\n*   **Careful Point 3: Linear Dependence.** A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that if the sum of the elements in each row of a square matrix is 0, the rows are linearly dependent. Specifically, the sum of the column vectors of the matrix is the zero vector. Another way to see this is that the vector `v = [1, 1, 1]^T` is a non-trivial solution to the equation `Ax = 0`, which means the null space of A is not empty, and A is a singular matrix.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Determinant of a Singular Matrix.** A square matrix has a determinant of 0 if and only if its rows (or columns) are linearly dependent. Since we have shown the rows are linearly dependent, the determinant must be 0.\n*   We can also show linear dependence directly: Notice that `Row 1 + Row 2 + Row 3 = [0, 0, 0]`. This explicit relationship confirms the linear dependence.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nBoth methods, direct calculation and analysis of the matrix properties, yield the same result. The information about the \"Markov quiver\" and \"\\( m_{1/2} \\)\" does not change the fact that we are asked to find the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix A.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe determinant is calculated to be `6 - 3 - 3 = 0`. This is confirmed by the property that the sum of each row is 0, which implies the matrix is singular and thus has a determinant of 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
