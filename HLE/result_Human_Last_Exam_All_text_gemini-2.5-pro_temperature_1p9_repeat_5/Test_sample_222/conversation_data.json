    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the relationship between the sequences\nLet the new 8-point sequence be `y(n)`. The problem states that `y(n)` is formed by interleaving the 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\nThis means the even-indexed elements of `y(n)` are the elements of `x(n)`, and the odd-indexed elements of `y(n)` are the elements of `h(n)`. We can write this formally as:\n*   `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\n### Step 2: Relate the 8-point DFT to the 4-point DFTs\nThe N-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence `g(n)` is given by `G(k) = sum_{n=0 to N-1} g(n) * W_N^(nk)`, where `W_N = exp(-j*2*pi/N)`.\n\nWe want to find `Y(k)`, the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`:\n`Y(k) = sum_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)`\n\nWe can split the sum into even and odd indices for `n`. Let `n = 2m` for even indices and `n = 2m+1` for odd indices.\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0 to 3} y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0 to 3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nNow, substitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`.\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_8^k * W_8^(2mk)`\n\nRecognize that `W_8^2 = exp(-j*2*pi*2/8) = exp(-j*2*pi/4) = W_4`. The equation becomes:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * sum_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n\nThe sums are the definitions of the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)`. So, the formula is:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\nThis formula connects the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` with the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n### Step 3: Develop computational formulas\nWe can split the calculation of `Y(k)` for `k=0..7` into two parts.\n1.  For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`: `k mod 4` is just `k`.\n    `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n2.  For `k = 4, 5, 6, 7`: Let `k = k' + 4` where `k' = 0, 1, 2, 3`. The `k mod 4` term becomes `k'`. Also, the twiddle factor `W_8^(k'+4)` becomes `W_8^(k') * W_8^4`. Since `W_8^4 = exp(-j*2*pi*4/8) = exp(-j*pi) = -1`, the formula is:\n    `Y(k' + 4) = X(k') - W_8^(k') * H(k')`\n\nThese two formulas are the core of the decimation-in-time Radix-2 FFT algorithm.\n\n### Step 4: List the data and calculate the necessary twiddle factors\n**Given Data:**\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\n**Twiddle Factors `W_8^k`:**\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = exp(-j*pi/4) = cos(pi/4) - j*sin(pi/4) = (1 - j) / sqrt(2)`\n*   `W_8^2 = exp(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = exp(-j*3*pi/4) = cos(3*pi/4) - j*sin(3*pi/4) = (-1 - j) / sqrt(2)`\n\n### Step 5: Perform the calculations\n**For k = 0:**\n*   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n*   `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n**For k = 1:**\n*   `Term = W_8^1 * H(1) = [(1-j)/sqrt(2)] * (1+j) = (1 - j^2)/sqrt(2) = (1 - (-1))/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)`\n*   `Y(1) = X(1) + Term = j + sqrt(2)`\n*   `Y(5) = X(1) - Term = j - sqrt(2)`\n\n**For k = 2:**\n*   `Term = W_8^2 * H(2) = (-j) * 1 = -j`\n*   `Y(2) = X(2) + Term = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y(6) = X(2) - Term = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n**For k = 3:**\n*   `Term = W_8^3 * H(3) = [(-1-j)/sqrt(2)] * (1-j) = (-1*(1+j)*(1-j))/sqrt(2) = (-1*(1-j^2))/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)`\n*   `Y(3) = X(3) + Term = -j + (-sqrt(2)) = -j - sqrt(2)`\n*   `Y(7) = X(3) - Term = -j - (-sqrt(2)) = -j + sqrt(2)`\n\n### Step 6: Assemble the final DFT sequence\nGathering all the calculated components, the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is:\n`Y(0) = 1`\n`Y(1) = sqrt(2) + j`\n`Y(2) = -1 - j`\n`Y(3) = -sqrt(2) - j`\n`Y(4) = 1`\n`Y(5) = -sqrt(2) + j`\n`Y(6) = -1 + j`\n`Y(7) = sqrt(2) - j`\n\nFinal answer in vector form:\n`Y(k) = [1,  sqrt(2)+j,  -1-j,  -sqrt(2)-j,  1,  -sqrt(2)+j,  -1+j,  sqrt(2)-j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
