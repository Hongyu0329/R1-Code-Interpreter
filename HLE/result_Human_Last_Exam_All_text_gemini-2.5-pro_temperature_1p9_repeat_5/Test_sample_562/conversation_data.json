    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the Japanese character 謄.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character:**\n    The Kanji character 謄 can be visually separated into a left part and a right part.\n    *   Left part: 言\n    *   Right part: 滕\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):**\n    In most Kanji with a left-right structure, the left-hand component serves as the radical, which is used to classify the character in a dictionary. This component often relates to the character's meaning.\n    *   The left part, 言, means \"word\" or \"speech.\" Characters with this radical often relate to speaking, language, or recording information. The character 謄 itself means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is directly related to written words.\n    *   The right part, 滕, acts as the phonetic component, indicating the character's pronunciation (in this case, \"tō\").\n    *   Therefore, the radical for 謄 is the left-hand component, 言.\n\n3.  **Find the Name of the Radical:**\n    Japanese radicals have specific names, and these names can change depending on their position within a character.\n    *   The radical is 言.\n    *   When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (hen) or \"ben\" (as in this case, due to voicing changes known as rendaku).\n    *   The specific name for the 言 radical when it is on the left side is \"gonben\" (ごんべん). The \"gon\" part comes from the on'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) of 言.\n\n4.  **Transcribe the Name into Hepburn:**\n    The final step is to write the Japanese name of the radical using Hepburn romanization, as requested by the user's example (\"Onnahen\" for 媛).\n    *   The Japanese name is ごんべん.\n    *   The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is \"gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Radical Position:** It is crucial to recognize that radical names often depend on their position (left side, right side, top, bottom, etc.). \"Hen/Ben\" is specifically for the left side.\n*   **Semantic vs. Phonetic Components:** It's important to distinguish between the radical (usually semantic) and the phonetic component. In 謄, 言 is the semantic radical, and 滕 is the phonetic component.\n*   **Hepburn Transcription:** Ensure the spelling is correct according to the Hepburn system (e.g., \"n\" before \"b\").\n\nFollowing these steps, the radical of 謄 is 言, and its name is Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
