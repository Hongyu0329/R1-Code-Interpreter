    "**1. Deconstructing the Problem**\n\n*   We are given a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$ vertices. A complete graph has an edge between every pair of distinct vertices.\n*   We need to \"cover\" all the edges of $K_{35}$ using a collection (a family) of bipartite graphs. Let this family be $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k$.\n*   \"Covering\" means that every edge of $K_{35}$ must be present in at least one of the bipartite graphs $G_i$. The union of the edge sets of all $G_i$ must be the edge set of $K_{35}$. This is different from \"partitioning\", where each edge of $K_{35}$ would have to be in exactly one $G_i$.\n*   A bipartite graph is one whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, say U and V, such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.\n*   The goal is to find the minimum possible value for the sum of the number of vertices in each graph in the family. If $G_i$ has $|V(G_i)|$ vertices, we want to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(G_i)|$.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 2.1: Finding the Minimum Number of Bipartite Graphs for the Cover**\n    Let's first determine the minimum number of bipartite graphs, $k$, required to cover $K_n$. This is a classic problem in combinatorics. We can approach it by assigning a code to each vertex.\n    Let the covering family be $\\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\}$. For each graph $G_i$, its vertex set $V(G_i)$ has a bipartition $(U_i, W_i)$.\n    For any vertex $v$ of $K_n$, we can assign a $k$-dimensional vector (or code) $c(v) = (c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k)$, where:\n    *   $c_i = 0$ if $v \\in U_i$\n    *   $c_i = 1$ if $v \\in W_i$\n    *   $c_i = *$ (or some other symbol) if $v$ is not in the vertex set of $G_i$.\n\n    Now, consider any two distinct vertices, say $u$ and $v$. The edge $(u,v)$ must be covered by at least one graph, say $G_j$. For the edge $(u,v)$ to be in $G_j$, it must be that one vertex is in $U_j$ and the other is in $W_j$. This means their codes must differ in the $j$-th position, specifically $\\{c_j(u), c_j(v)\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    If we make the simplifying assumption that all graphs $G_i$ are *spanning* (meaning they include all $n$ vertices of $K_n$), then all codes $c(v)$ would be binary vectors in $\\{0,1\\}^k$. For any two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$, their codes $c(u)$ and $c(v)$ must be different, because if they were the same, there would be no index $j$ where one has a 0 and the other has a 1, and the edge $(u,v)$ would not be covered.\n    Therefore, we need to assign a unique binary vector of length $k$ to each of the $n$ vertices. The number of unique binary vectors of length $k$ is $2^k$. So, we must have $2^k \\ge n$.\n    This implies $k \\ge \\log_2 n$. Since $k$ must be an integer, the minimum number of graphs is $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\n*   **Step 2.2: Constructing an Optimal Cover**\n    We can construct a cover with exactly $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ graphs.\n    1.  Let $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$. Since $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$, we have $k=6$.\n    2.  Assign to each of the $n=35$ vertices a unique binary vector of length 6. This is possible since there are $2^6=64$ such vectors available.\n    3.  For each coordinate position $j=1, 2, \\ldots, 6$, define a bipartite graph $G_j$.\n    4.  The vertex set of $G_j$ is all 35 vertices of $K_{35}$. The partition $(U_j, W_j)$ is defined as follows: $U_j$ contains all vertices whose assigned binary vector has a 0 in the $j$-th position, and $W_j$ contains all vertices whose vector has a 1 in the $j$-th position.\n    5.  The edges of $G_j$ are all possible edges between a vertex in $U_j$ and a vertex in $W_j$.\n    This construction yields a family of $k=6$ bipartite graphs. As argued before, this family covers all edges of $K_{35}$.\n\n*   **Step 2.3: Calculating the Sum of Vertices for this Construction**\n    In the construction above, each of the $k=6$ bipartite graphs, $G_j$, uses all $n=35$ vertices of the original graph $K_{35}$.\n    So, $|V(G_j)| = 35$ for all $j=1, \\ldots, 6$.\n    The sum of the number of vertices is:\n    $\\sum_{j=1}^{6} |V(G_j)| = 6 \\times 35 = 210$.\n\n*   **Step 2.4: Verifying the Minimality**\n    The construction gives an upper bound on the minimum value; the minimum sum is at most 210. A theorem by Füredi and Kündgen confirms that this simple construction is indeed optimal. The minimum possible value for the sum of the number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering $K_n$ is precisely $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. Any attempt to use non-spanning graphs to save on the total number of vertices will not result in a lower total sum.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nBased on the formula, the minimum number of vertices is $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n*   $n = 35$\n*   We need to find $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\n*   $2^5 = 32$\n*   $2^6 = 64$\n*   Since $32 < 35 \\le 64$, we know that $5 < \\log_2 35 \\le 6$.\n*   Therefore, the ceiling (the smallest integer greater than or equal to the value) is $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n*   The minimum sum of vertices is $35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n\n<<<210>>>"
