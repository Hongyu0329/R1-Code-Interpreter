    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene, CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂). This is a conjugated diene, meaning it has alternating double and single bonds.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂). This is a substituted alkene and serves as a dienophile (a compound that reacts with a diene).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a [4+2] cycloaddition, commonly known as the **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Mechanism of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted, pericyclic reaction where six π-electrons (four from the diene, two from the dienophile) rearrange to form a more stable cyclohexene ring.\n*   Two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new pi (π) bond are formed at the expense of three old π bonds.\n*   The four carbons of the diene and the two carbons of the dienophile combine to form the new six-membered ring. The double bond in the product appears between the central two carbons of the original diene (C2 and C3).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Regioselectivity**\n*   **The Diene:** 1,3-butadiene is a symmetrical molecule.\n*   **The Dienophile:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is unsymmetrical. It has a CCl₂ group on one side of the double bond and a CF₂ group on the other.\n*   Because the dienophile is unsymmetrical, two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers) could potentially form, depending on how the diene and dienophile orient themselves during the reaction.\n*   The regiochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction is governed by electronic effects, specifically the interaction between the diene's Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the dienophile's Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO).\n*   **Electronic Effects:**\n    1.  The diene acts as the electron-rich component (nucleophile). Its HOMO has the largest electron density (coefficients) on its terminal carbons (C1 and C4).\n    2.  The dienophile is the electron-poor component (electrophile). We need to identify the more electrophilic carbon atom in CCl₂=CF₂. This will be the carbon atom with the largest coefficient in the LUMO.\n    3.  Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine. The powerful inductive electron withdrawal by the two fluorine atoms makes the CF₂ carbon more electron-deficient (more δ+) than the CCl₂ carbon.\n    4.  Therefore, the CF₂ carbon is the more electrophilic site.\n*   **Predicting the Product:** The reaction favors the orientation where the most nucleophilic site of the diene (C1 or C4) attacks the most electrophilic site of the dienophile (the CF₂ carbon).\n*   This means a bond will form between a terminal carbon of butadiene and the CF₂ carbon, and the other terminal carbon will bond to the CCl₂ carbon.\n\n**Step 4: Draw and Name the Final Product**\n*   Following the regioselectivity determined in the previous step, we can draw the structure of the major product. It is a cyclohexene ring with a CCl₂ group and a CF₂ group on adjacent saturated carbons.\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n           CH=CH\n          /     \\\n      H₂C       CH₂\n         \\     /\n          CF₂-CCl₂\n    ```\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The parent structure is a six-membered ring with one double bond, which is named **cyclohexene**.\n    2.  The double bond is assigned positions 1 and 2, making it **cyclohex-1-ene**.\n    3.  We number the ring to give the substituents (the chlorine and fluorine atoms) the lowest possible numbers (locants). Numbering in either direction from the double bond gives the locant set {4, 4, 5, 5}.\n    4.  Since the locant set is the same regardless of numbering direction, we apply the alphabetical rule. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically.\n    5.  Therefore, the carbon bearing the two chlorine atoms is assigned the lower number, C4, and the carbon with the two fluorine atoms is assigned C5.\n*   **Final Name:** Combining these parts, the product is named **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Always identify the reaction type first.\n*   For Diels-Alder reactions, check for symmetry in both the diene and dienophile. If either is unsymmetrical, consider regioselectivity.\n*   Use electronic principles (like comparing electronegativity and inductive effects) to predict the regiochemical outcome.\n*   Apply IUPAC nomenclature rules systematically and carefully, paying attention to priorities (double bonds > substituents) and tie-breakers (lowest locants, then alphabetical order).\n\nThe final product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
