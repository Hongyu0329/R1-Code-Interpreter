    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Metric for Rarity**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to consider the total amount (mass) of each gas present on the entire planet (in the atmosphere, crust, mantle, etc.) relative to the Earth's total mass.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stable Noble Gases**\nFirst, let's compare the abundances of the stable (non-radioactive) noble gases. The vast majority of these gases are found in the Earth's atmosphere. Their abundance in the atmosphere is a good proxy for their overall rarity.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant, making up about 0.934% of the atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The next most abundant at about 18.2 parts per million (ppm).\n*   **Helium (He):** Less abundant than Neon at about 5.2 ppm. While it's common in the universe, its lightness allows it to escape Earth's gravity.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Rarer still, at about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the stable noble gases, with an atmospheric concentration of only about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n\nBased on this, Xenon is the rarest among the *stable* noble gases.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Radioactive Noble Gas, Radon**\nRadon (Rn) is unique in this group because it is radioactive. All of its isotopes have short half-lives.\n*   The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   Radon is not a primordial element left over from Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously generated through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are present in the Earth's crust.\n*   Because Radon decays so quickly, it never accumulates in significant quantities. It exists in a state of transient equilibrium, where its rate of creation is balanced by its rate of decay.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Rarest Stable Gas (Xenon) with Radon**\nTo find the absolute rarest noble gas, we must compare the total amount of Xenon on Earth to the total amount of Radon present at any given time.\n\n*   **Total Mass of Xenon:** The mass of Earth's atmosphere is about 5.15 x 10^18 kg. With a concentration of ~0.09 ppm, the total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is roughly 2.1 x 10^12 kg (over 2 trillion kilograms).\n*   **Total Mass of Radon:** Due to its very short half-life, the total amount of Radon on the entire planet at any single moment is incredibly small. Scientific estimates place the total amount of Radon gas in the Earth's atmosphere at only about 21 grams. The amount in the crust is estimated to be on the order of tens of kilograms. The total is well under 100 kg.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion and Consideration of the Year 2002**\nComparing the total amounts, the mass of Radon (less than 100 kg) is vastly smaller—by a factor of trillions—than the mass of Xenon (~2.1 x 10^12 kg). Therefore, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\nThe year 2002 specified in the question does not change the outcome. The abundances of stable gases like Xenon are geologically constant over human timescales. The steady-state equilibrium concentration of Radon, governed by the very slow decay of its parent elements (Uranium-238 and Thorium-232, with half-lives of billions of years), is also constant over such a short period. The answer in 2002 would be the same as it is today.\n\nFinal analysis leads to the conclusion that Radon is the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
