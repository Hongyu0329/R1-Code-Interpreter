    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts of the question.**\n*   **Reverse Turn:** This is a standard figure in ballroom dancing that involves turning to the left.\n*   **Overturning a Turn:** This means rotating more than the standard, textbook amount prescribed for a given figure. For example, if a figure is meant to turn 3/8 of a circle, overturning it would mean turning 1/2 or 5/8 of a circle in the same number of steps.\n*   **\"Without disregarding the technique\":** This is the crucial part of the question. It asks in which dance the fundamental, defining principles of its technique make overturning impossible. It's not about physical impossibility, but about technical incorrectness.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the technique of the \"swing\" dances.**\n*   **Dances:** This category includes Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep.\n*   **Core Technique:** These dances are characterized by \"swing,\" which involves a pendulum-like motion of the legs and body, creating continuous flow and momentum. This momentum is what generates rotation in the turns.\n*   **Overturning in Swing Dances:** Because the turn is generated by momentum and flow, it is relatively easy and common to increase or decrease the amount of rotation. Advanced dancers frequently \"overturn\" or \"underturn\" figures to change their alignment on the dance floor or for choreographic effect. Doing so does not violate the fundamental principle of \"swing\"; in fact, it is a skilled manipulation of that very principle. Therefore, in these dances (A, B, D, E), it is possible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the core technique.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the technique of the European Tango.**\n*   **Core Technique:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its technique is defined by what it *lacks*:\n    *   **No Swing:** Movement is staccato, sharp, and direct. The feet are picked up and placed, not swung into position.\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept on one level, creating a stealthy, \"cat-like\" quality.\n    *   **No CBM (Contra Body Movement) in the typical sense:** While there is body turn, it is a sharp twist rather than the flowing CBM of the swing dances.\n*   **Overturning in Tango:** A Tango reverse turn is a progressive figure, not a rotational one. The amount of turn is small and precisely executed on each step. To rotate more (overturn), a dancer would be forced to introduce momentum and a swinging action. This would violate the most fundamental rules of Tango technique (No Swing, No Rise and Fall). The staccato character would be lost and replaced by a flowing rotation, making it look like a poor attempt at a Waltz or Foxtrot figure.\n*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, attempting to overturn a reverse turn in Tango inevitably requires a disregard for its core technique. The very act of overturning is antithetical to how Tango is supposed to be danced.\n\n**Step 4: Final comparison and answer.**\n*   In the Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, overturning is a variation that works *with* the dance's technical foundation of swing and momentum.\n*   In the European Tango, overturning works *against* the dance's technical foundation of staccato, non-swinging movement. It is, by definition, a disregard of the technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
