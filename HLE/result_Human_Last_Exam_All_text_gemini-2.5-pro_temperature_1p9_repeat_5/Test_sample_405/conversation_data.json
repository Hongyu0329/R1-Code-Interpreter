    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the number of distinct colors that can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus. An allotrope is a different structural form of the same element in the same physical state. The key is to identify the major allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors, being careful to distinguish between truly different colors and mere shades or impure forms.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main allotropes of phosphorus and their properties**\nPhosphorus exists in several different allotropic forms. The most well-known and structurally distinct solid allotropes are:\n1.  **White Phosphorus**\n2.  **Red Phosphorus**\n3.  **Violet Phosphorus**\n4.  **Black Phosphorus**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the color of each major allotrope**\n\n*   **White Phosphorus (P₄):**\n    *   **Structure:** It consists of discrete tetrahedral P₄ molecules.\n    *   **Appearance:** When pure, it is a translucent, waxy solid that is colorless or **white**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is often seen with a yellowish tint. This \"yellow phosphorus\" is not a distinct allotrope but is white phosphorus contaminated with traces of red phosphorus, to which it slowly converts upon exposure to light. The pure allotrope is white/colorless.\n    *   **Color Count:** 1 (White)\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus (Pₙ):**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a complex polymeric amorphous (non-crystalline) structure.\n    *   **Appearance:** It is a powder whose color is typically a dark **red**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** There are variations in preparation that lead to different shades. For example, \"Scarlet phosphorus\" is a brighter red form, but it is also amorphous and often considered a variation of red phosphorus rather than a fundamentally different allotrope. For a distinct color count, we will classify this general form as \"Red\".\n    *   **Color Count:** 1 (Red)\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus, Pₙ):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is also a polymeric form, but unlike red phosphorus, it is crystalline (monoclinic). This distinct crystal structure makes it a separate allotrope.\n    *   **Appearance:** As its name suggests, it consists of deep **violet** or purple crystals.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Although it is polymeric like red phosphorus, its distinct crystalline nature and characteristically different color (violet is not simply a shade of red) mean it should be counted separately.\n    *   **Color Count:** 1 (Violet)\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus (Pₙ):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope. It has a layered, crystalline (orthorhombic) structure similar to graphite.\n    *   **Appearance:** It is a **black** solid with a metallic sheen and is flaky like graphite.\n    *   **Careful Point:** There are other crystalline forms (e.g., rhombohedral), but they are also black.\n    *   **Color Count:** 1 (Black)\n\n**Step 4: Summarize the distinct colors and count them**\nBy analyzing the four major, structurally distinct, and commonly recognized categories of phosphorus allotropes, we identify four unique colors:\n1.  **White** (from white phosphorus)\n2.  **Red** (from amorphous red phosphorus)\n3.  **Violet** (from crystalline Hittorf's phosphorus)\n4.  **Black** (from layered black phosphorus)\n\nOther forms like scarlet, fibrous, or the recently discovered 2D blue phosphorus exist, but the four listed above represent the most fundamental and universally accepted classes of allotropes with distinct colors. Scarlet and fibrous red are often classified under the \"Red\" family, and blue phosphorus is a non-bulk 2D material, which might not be considered in a traditional count. Therefore, the most robust answer is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$."
