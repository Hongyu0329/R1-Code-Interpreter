    "This is an interesting question that requires a careful reading of John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* and a clear definition of the term \"historical saint.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define \"Historical Saint\" in the Context of Milton**\n\n*   **Historical**: This refers to individuals presented as real people who lived in the past. For Milton, the figures of the Bible were historical reality.\n*   **Saint**: Milton was a devout Protestant (a Puritan). He would not have subscribed to the Catholic process of canonization. For Milton, a \"saint\" (from the Greek *hagios*, meaning \"holy one\") would be any righteous, holy person chosen by God, particularly the key figures of the Old and New Testaments. We will therefore consider prominent righteous figures from the Bible who are mentioned by name.\n\n**Step 2: Systematic Search through *Paradise Lost***\n\nThe most logical places to find such a list are in the sections where Milton recounts biblical history. The primary section is the vision the Archangel Michael shows to Adam in Books XI and XII. Other names appear in different contexts, such as the invocation or the catalogue of fallen angels in Book I.\n\n**Step 3: Identify and Vet Each Mentioned Name**\n\nWe will go through the poem and list figures who are named and fit our definition.\n\n*   **Old Testament Figures:**\n    1.  **Adam**: A central character throughout the poem. (Count: 1)\n    2.  **Eve**: A central character throughout the poem. (Count: 2)\n    3.  **Abel**: Michael shows Adam the first murder, naming Abel as the righteous victim (Book XI, line 445). (Count: 3)\n    4.  **Enoch**: Mentioned as the one who \"walkd with God\" and was taken to Heaven for his piety without tasting death (Book XI, lines 665-709). (Count: 4)\n    5.  **Noah**: Named as the one righteous man who builds the ark to survive the great flood (Book XI, lines 719, 808). (Count: 5)\n    6.  **Abraham**: Mentioned by his original name, **Abram**, and identified as the patriarch called from Ur who becomes the \"Father of a Nation\" (Book XII, line 113). (Count: 6)\n    7.  **Moses**: Named prominently as the one who received the law from God (Book I, line 8) and as a leader chosen by God to deliver his people from Egypt (Book XII, line 171). (Count: 7)\n    8.  **Aaron**: Named alongside his brother as one of the two \"sent from God\" to lead the Israelites (Book XII, line 172). (Count: 8)\n    9.  **Joshua**: Named as the successor to Moses who will lead the people into the promised land. Milton explicitly notes the link between his name and Jesus's: \"Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call\" (Book XII, line 310). (Count: 9)\n    10. **David**: Mentioned as the ancestor of the messianic kingly line: \"...and from the Royal stock / Of David, chosen by God...\" (Book XII, line 326). As a king, prophet, and psalmist, he is a major holy figure. (Count: 10)\n    11. **Solomon**: Named in Book I, where Milton notes that even the \"wisest heart / Of Solomon\" was tricked by demonic influence into allowing idolatry (Book I, line 400). Despite this failing, he is a key historical figure and biblical author. (Count: 11)\n    12. **Josiah**: Named as the \"good Josiah\" who drove the pagan idols and rites from the Temple in Jerusalem (Book I, line 418). He is a model of a righteous king. (Count: 12)\n\n*   **New Testament Figures:**\n    13. **Jesus**: He is the ultimate hero of the epic, the \"greater Man\" of the opening line. While the name \"Jesus\" is only used once in direct comparison to Joshua, he is a central character referred to constantly by his titles, which function as names within the poem: \"the Son,\" \"Messiah,\" \"Christ,\" \"Saviour,\" and \"Immanuel.\" He is unquestionably a \"historical saint\" mentioned in the poem. (Count: 13)\n\n### Careful Points and Exclusions\n\nIt is important to note who is *not* mentioned by name, even if they are alluded to:\n\n*   **Sarah, Isaac, and Jacob**: These key patriarchs are described in their roles (e.g., Abraham's wife and son, the father of the twelve tribes), but their specific names are not used.\n*   **Joseph**: His story of being sold into Egypt is summarized, but he is only called \"a younger son\" (Book XII, line 163).\n*   **Mary, Mother of Jesus**: She is referred to as \"a Virgin,\" but the name \"Mary\" never appears in the poem.\n*   **John the Baptist**: The baptism of Jesus is mentioned, but the baptizer is not named.\n*   **The Apostles (Peter, Paul, John, etc.)**: They are referred to collectively as \"his followers,\" but none are singled out by name. Milton was likely avoiding any implication of apostolic succession or special status that could echo Catholic tradition.\n\n### Final Count\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the text, counting only righteous historical figures from the Bible who are explicitly mentioned by name or an undeniable, consistently used title, we arrive at a total of 13.\n\nThe list is: Adam, Eve, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, Solomon, Josiah, and Jesus (as the Son/Messiah).\n\n<<<13>>>"
