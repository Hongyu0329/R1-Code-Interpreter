No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry syndromes is to provide a consistent warning signal to predators. The validity of the mimicry depends on the *predator's* perception, not a human's. The visual systems of key bumblebee predators, such as birds, are fundamentally different from humans, notably in their ability to see ultraviolet (UV) light. Two bee species that appear identical to a human may have different UV patterns and be easily distinguishable to a bird. Therefore, using human undergraduates to rank similarity will likely produce clusters that do not reflect the actual, functional mimicry rings in nature, making the methodology invalid for its stated ecological purpose.
