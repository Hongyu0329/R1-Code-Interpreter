    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core elements of the question are:\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (the square in front of the Pantheon).\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** It was removed.\n*   **Agent:** The city administration.\n*   **Timeframe:** In 1950.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Architectural Feature\"**\nThis term can be interpreted broadly. It doesn't necessarily mean part of a building, but rather a significant, man-made element that shaped the appearance and function of the square. This could include infrastructure, pavement, or other structural elements.\n\n**Step 3: Research the History of Piazza della Rotonda**\nTo find out what was removed in 1950, we need to look at the history of the square's development, particularly in the 20th century. Historical photographs are an excellent source for this kind of research.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Changes in the 20th Century**\n*   Comparing photographs of the Piazza della Rotonda from the first half of the 20th century (e.g., 1920s-1940s) with photos from after 1950 reveals a major difference in the square's infrastructure.\n*   Historical photos clearly show a public transportation system running directly through the square. This system consisted of metal tracks embedded in the cobblestone pavement and overhead electrical lines to power the vehicles.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Specific Feature**\nThe feature in question is the public **tramway line**. A tram line ran right across the Piazza della Rotonda, with tracks passing very close to the famous central fountain (Fontana del Pantheon).\n\n**Step 6: Confirm the Removal and Timeline**\n*   After World War II, Rome's city administration undertook a major project to modernize its public transportation network and to \"liberate\" its most important historical monuments from what was seen as invasive modern infrastructure.\n*   The vibrations from the heavy trams were considered a potential threat to the ancient structures like the Pantheon. Furthermore, the tracks and overhead wires cluttered the view of the monuments.\n*   For these reasons, many tram lines in the historic center were decommissioned and replaced with bus routes. The line running through the Piazza della Rotonda was one of those removed during this period. The year 1950 falls directly within this timeframe of tramway dismantlement in central Rome.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Broad Definition of \"Feature\":** It is crucial not to limit the search to buildings alone, but to include infrastructure like transportation systems.\n2.  **Visual Evidence:** Historical photographs are key to confirming the past appearance of the square and identifying what is now missing.\n3.  **Context of Urban Planning:** The removal was not an isolated event but part of a larger city-wide policy in post-war Rome concerning traffic, historical preservation, and public transport modernization.\n4.  **Distinguishing from other features:** The Fontana del Pantheon and the obelisk were not removed. The pavement itself was later redone, but the fundamental removal of a major *system* in 1950 points specifically to the tramway.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the unique architectural feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 was the public tramway line, which included both the tracks on the ground and the overhead electrical cables.\n\n<<<The public tramway line (tracks and overhead wires)>>>"
