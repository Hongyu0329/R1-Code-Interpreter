    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Topic:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Core Question:** The question states that HRV is computed from a \"value between heartbeats\" and asks for the name of that specific value.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Beat-to-beat interval:** This is the fundamental piece of data. It is the measure of time between one heartbeat and the next.\n    *   **HRV:** This is not the interval itself, but the statistical measure of the *variation* in these intervals over a period of time. A low HRV means the time between beats is very consistent, while a high HRV means the time between beats varies more.\n    *   **PPG:** This sensor technology measures changes in blood volume in the microvascular bed of tissue, which corresponds to the cardiac cycle. It generates a waveform with a peak for each pulse.\n\n3.  **List All Careful Points & Terminology:**\n    *   **The fundamental measurement is a duration:** The \"value between heartbeats\" is a time duration, typically measured in milliseconds (ms).\n    *   **General Terms:** The most general terms for this duration are \"beat-to-beat interval\" (BBI) or **\"Inter-beat Interval\" (IBI)**. These terms are accurate regardless of the technology used.\n    *   **ECG-specific Term:** The gold standard for measuring HRV is an Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG signal has a distinct pattern called the QRS complex for each heartbeat, with the 'R' wave being the most prominent peak. The time interval between two consecutive R waves is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   **PPG-specific Term:** As the question states, PPG is being used. A PPG signal has peaks corresponding to the pulse wave. The interval between two consecutive peaks is technically called the **Peak-to-Peak (P-P) interval**.\n    *   **The Common Usage:** Although PPG technically measures P-P intervals, these intervals are used as a proxy or surrogate for the R-R intervals from an ECG. In the vast majority of scientific literature, apps, and discussions about HRV, the term **R-R interval** is used universally to refer to the beat-to-beat interval, even when the data originates from a PPG sensor. It is the most widely recognized and standard term.\n    *   **Filtered Data Term:** For accurate HRV analysis, raw beat-to-beat intervals are often \"cleaned\" to remove artifacts or ectopic (abnormal) beats. The resulting intervals between two consecutive *normal* sinus rhythm beats are called **Normal-to-Normal (NN) intervals**. The final HRV metrics (like RMSSD, SDNN) are calculated from these NN intervals.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to compute HRV has several names depending on the context and specificity.\n\n1.  The general, technology-agnostic term is **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n2.  The technically correct term for PPG-derived data is the **P-P interval**.\n3.  The most common, standard, and widely understood term in the entire field of HRV, used for data from both ECG and PPG, is the **R-R interval**.\n\nGiven that \"R-R interval\" is the industry and scientific standard term when discussing the foundational data for HRV, it stands as the most appropriate and comprehensive answer.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
