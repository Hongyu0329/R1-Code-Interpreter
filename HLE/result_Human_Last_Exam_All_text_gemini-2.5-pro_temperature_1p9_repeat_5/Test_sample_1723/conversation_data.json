    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the name of a specific mushroom genus. The primary and sole characteristic provided is that it produces a \"distinctly blue spore print\". The question also specifies there is a \"single genus\" with this trait, implying it is unique.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding \"Spore Print\"**\nA spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology. It is the color of the mass of microscopic spores when they are deposited on a surface. This color is often different from the color of the mushroom's flesh, gills, or any liquid (latex) it might exude. This is a very important point of consideration.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating Common Misconceptions**\n*   **Lactarius indigo:** This is a famous and beautiful blue mushroom. When cut, it bleeds a blue latex. Due to its striking blue color, it is often the first mushroom that comes to mind. However, its spore print is not blue. The spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is cream to yellowish. Therefore, *Lactarius* is not the correct genus.\n*   **Entoloma hochstetteri:** This is another vividly blue mushroom, native to New Zealand. Despite its blue cap and stem, its spore print is pinkish-brown, which is characteristic of the *Entoloma* genus. Thus, *Entoloma* is also incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Correct Genus**\nResearching fungi with blue spore prints reveals that this is an extremely rare trait. In fact, there is only one genus known to possess it.\n*   This genus is not a typical gilled mushroom (agaric) with a cap and stem. It is a type of crust fungus.\n*   The species is *Terana caerulea*, commonly known as the cobalt crust fungus.\n*   This fungus grows flat on decaying wood and has a velvety, vibrant blue surface.\n*   Critically, its spore print is a pale blue.\n*   Since *Terana caerulea* is the type species for its genus, the genus itself is named **Terana**.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesizing the Final Answer**\nWhile the common understanding of \"mushroom\" often pictures a cap and stem, the term can be used more broadly in mycology to refer to the macroscopic, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus. Given that the question asserts a single genus exists, and *Terana* is the only one scientifically recognized to produce a blue spore print, it is the correct answer.\n\n**Careful Points to Remember:**\n1.  **Do not confuse the color of the mushroom's body with the color of its spores.** This is the most common mistake.\n2.  Recognize that the term \"mushroom\" can be used in a broad sense that includes non-gilled fungi like crust fungi.\n3.  The uniqueness of this trait (\"a single genus\") is a strong clue that the answer is not a common, widely known genus like *Lactarius*.\n\nThe single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print is *Terana*.\n\n<<<Terana>>>"
