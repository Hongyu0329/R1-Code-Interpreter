    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European verb *seh2gieti into its descendants in several old Germanic languages.\n\n### **Step 1: From Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE form**: The starting point is *seh2gieti*.\n    *   **Root**: *seh2g-* meaning 'to track, seek out'.\n    *   **Suffix**: *-ie/o-*, which forms present tense verbs, often with a stative or causative meaning.\n    *   **Ending**: *-ti*, the 3rd person singular primary active indicative ending.\n\n2.  **Apply PIE to PGmc Sound Changes**:\n    *   **Laryngeal Effect**: The laryngeal *h2* colors the preceding vowel *e* to *a*. In most daughter languages except Anatolian, the sequence *eh2* before a consonant develops into a long vowel *ā*. So, PIE *seh2g-* becomes pre-Germanic *sāg-*.\n    *   **Vowel Shift**: PIE *ā* becomes PGmc *ō*. Therefore, the pre-Germanic root *sāg-* becomes the Proto-Germanic root **\\*sōk-**.\n    *   **Grimm's Law**: This law affects PIE stop consonants. The voiced velar stop *g* becomes a voiceless velar stop *k*.\n    *   **Verb Class**: The PIE suffix *-ie/o-* leads to the formation of Class I weak verbs in Proto-Germanic. These verbs have an infinitive ending in **\\*-ijaną** and a present stem formed with **\\*-i-**.\n    *   **Ending**: The PIE 3rd person singular ending *-ti* becomes **\\*-þi** (or **\\*-þ**) in Proto-Germanic.\n\n3.  **Reconstruct the Proto-Germanic Form**:\n    *   Combining the root *sōk-* with the Class I weak present stem element *-i-* and the 3rd singular ending *-þi* gives us the form **\\*sōkiþi** or, more commonly cited in its syncopated form, **\\*sōkiþ**. The infinitive would be **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n### **Step 2: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **Start with PGmc form**: **\\*sōkiþ**\n2.  **Apply i-Umlaut (i-mutation)**: The high front vowel /i/ in the syllable after the root (*-iþ*) causes the back root vowel *ō* /oː/ to be fronted. In Old Norse, *ō* becomes *œ̄* /øː/. So the stem *sōk-* becomes *sœ̄k-*.\n3.  **Ending Development**: The Proto-Germanic ending *-iþ* develops into Proto-Norse *-iʀ*, which eventually becomes the Old Norse 3rd person singular present indicative ending **-r**. The *-i-* that caused the umlaut is lost.\n4.  **Reconstruct the Old Norse Form**: Combining the umlauted stem *sœ̄k-* with the ending *-r* gives **sœkir**. The infinitive is *sœkja*.\n\n### **Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **Start with PGmc form**: **\\*sōkiþ**\n2.  **Apply i-Umlaut (i-mutation)**: Similar to Old Norse, the /i/ in the ending causes the root vowel *ō* /oː/ to be fronted. In Old English, the result of i-umlaut on *ō* is *ē* /eː/. So the stem *sōk-* becomes *sēk-*.\n3.  **Palatalization**: In Old English, the velar consonant *k* becomes palatalized to *č* /tʃ/ when it comes before a front vowel like the newly formed *ē*. This sound is spelled with a <c> in Old English manuscripts, sometimes indicated as <ċ> in modern editions. So the stem *sēk-* becomes *sēċ-*.\n4.  **Ending Development**: The PGmc ending *-iþ* becomes **-þ** or **-eþ** in Old English. The connecting vowel *i* is lost.\n5.  **Reconstruct the Old English Form**: Combining the palatalized, umlauted stem *sēċ-* with the ending *-þ* gives **sēċþ**. The alternative form with a restored vowel, *sēceþ*, is also common. The infinitive is *sēcan*.\n\n### **Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **Start with PGmc form**: **\\*sōkiþ**\n2.  **OHG Vowel Shift**: Proto-Germanic long vowel *ō* becomes the diphthong *uo* in Old High German. So, *sōk-* becomes *suok-*.\n3.  **Apply i-Umlaut (i-mutation)**: The /i/ in the ending umlauts the diphthong *uo* to *üe*. While this sound change occurred, it was often not represented in early OHG spelling, which might still use <uo>. The stem is phonologically *süoch-*.\n4.  **High German Consonant Shift**: The Proto-Germanic voiceless stop *k* is affected. In the position after a vowel, it becomes the fricative *hh* /xx/. This sound was spelled <ch> or <hh>. So the stem *suok-*/*süoch-* becomes *suoch-*. (Note: In the infinitive *suohhen*, the *hh* comes from the shifting of the geminated *kk* from West Germanic *sōkkjan*).\n5.  **Ending Development**: The PGmc ending *-iþ* becomes **-it** in Old High German.\n6.  **Reconstruct the Old High German Form**: Combining the stem *suoch-* with the ending *-it* gives **suochit**. The infinitive is *suohhen* (modern German *suchen*).\n\n### **Final Summary of Descendants**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic**: \\*sōkiþ\n*   **Old Norse**: sœkir\n*   **Old English**: sēċþ (or sēceþ)\n*   **Old High German**: suochit\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ; Old Norse: sœkir; Old English: sēċþ; Old High German: suochit>>>"
