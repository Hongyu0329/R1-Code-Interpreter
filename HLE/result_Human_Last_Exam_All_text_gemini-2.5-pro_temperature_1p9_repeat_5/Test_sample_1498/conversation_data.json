    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks about a specific section within the poem \"Aqeedat al-'Awaam\" (The Creed of the Laymen).\n2.  **Identify the Author:** The poem is correctly attributed to Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi.\n3.  **Identify the Specific Content:** The question wants to pinpoint the verses (abyat) that list the names of the Prophets in Islam.\n4.  **Determine the Required Output:** The final answer needs to state the range of verses, i.e., \"from bayt X to bayt Y\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Poem Structure:** \"Aqeedat al-'Awaam\" is a structured poem that covers theological topics in a specific order. It discusses Allah, then moves to His messengers (prophets), then angels, scriptures, etc. The listing of the prophets' names appears within the section dedicated to them.\n2.  **Verse Numbering:** While there can be minor variations in numbering in different editions, the standard and widely accepted numbering is quite consistent for a famous poem like this. We will use this standard numbering.\n3.  **Identifying the Start:** We must find the exact verse where the enumeration of names begins. Often, the preceding verse serves as an introduction.\n4.  **Identifying the End:** We must find the verse where the list of names concludes, before the poem moves on to the next topic (which is the angels).\n5.  **The List's Content:** The poem lists the 25 prophets mentioned by name in the Qur'an, belief in whom is considered an obligation.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Locating the introductory verse.**\n    Before listing the names, the author states that knowing the names of 25 prophets is necessary. This occurs in **Bayt 27**:\n    *وَتَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ * كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ*\n    (The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every legally responsible person, so verify and seize the opportunity).\n    This verse sets the stage but does not yet name the prophets.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identifying the first verse with names.**\n    The very next verse, **Bayt 28**, begins the enumeration of the prophets' names, starting with Prophet Adam (عليه السلام):\n    *فَهُمْ آدَمٌ إدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعَ * صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ*\n    (They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud with Salih, and Ibrahim - each is to be followed).\n    This is the definitive starting point of the list.\n\n*   **Step 3: Following the continuation of the list.**\n    The list continues in the subsequent verses:\n    *   **Bayt 29:** Lists Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 30:** Lists Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu 'l-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identifying the final verse with names.**\n    The list of the 25 prophets is completed in **Bayt 31**. This verse concludes with our Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), referred to as 'Taha' and the 'Seal' (Khatim).\n    *إلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا*\n    (Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [Muhammad], the Seal - leave misguidance).\n    This is the definitive end point of the list.\n\n*   **Step 5: Confirming the end by checking the next verse.**\n    The topic changes in the next verse, **Bayt 32**, which begins the discussion on angels:\n    *وَالْمَلَكُ الَّذِي بِلاَ أَبٍ وَأُمٍّ...*\n    (And the angels are those without a father or a mother...).\n    This confirms that the section on the prophets' names concluded at Bayt 31.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The names of the prophets are explicitly mentioned from Bayt 28 through to Bayt 31.\n\n<<<From Bayt 28 to Bayt 31.>>>"
