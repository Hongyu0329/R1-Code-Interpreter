    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for the given system using the path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function (Z) for a quantum system is defined as the trace of the statistical operator $e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})}$, where:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential of the reservoir.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   The trace $\\text{Tr}[\\cdot]$ is taken over a complete set of states in the Fock space.\n\nThe question specifies that the system's Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. It's important to treat the $\\mu$ in the Hamiltonian definition and the $\\mu$ from the grand canonical ensemble as the same parameter.\n\nSubstituting the given Hamiltonian into the definition of Z:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})}]$\n$Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N} - \\mu \\hat{N})}]$\n$Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})}]$\n$Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}]$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the System to a Non-Interacting Gas**\n\nThe path integral formalism for the grand canonical partition function is most straightforwardly applied to systems of non-interacting particles. The Hamiltonian for such a system is given in second quantization by:\n$\\hat{H}_{std} = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k a_k^\\dagger a_k$\nwhere $\\epsilon_k$ are the single-particle energy levels and $a_k^\\dagger, a_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a particle in state $k$.\n\nThe particle number operator is:\n$\\hat{N} = \\sum_k a_k^\\dagger a_k$\n\nComparing the given Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$ with the standard form, we have:\n$-\\mu \\sum_k a_k^\\dagger a_k = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k a_k^\\dagger a_k$\n\nThis implies that our system can be modeled as a gas of non-interacting particles where every single-particle state $k$ has the same degenerate energy level $\\epsilon_k = -\\mu$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Standard Path Integral Result**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function for a general system of non-interacting particles has a standard result derived from the path integral formulation. The result depends on the statistics of the particles (Bosons or Fermions).\n\nLet $M$ be the total number of single-particle states available to the system. The path integral evaluation leads to the following general formulas:\n\n*   **For Bosons:** The particles are bosons, which obey Bose-Einstein statistics. The partition function is a product over all single-particle states:\n    $Z_B = \\prod_{k=1}^{M} [1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}]^{-1}$\n\n*   **For Fermions:** The particles are fermions, which obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and the Pauli exclusion principle. The partition function is:\n    $Z_F = \\prod_{k=1}^{M} [1 + e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}]$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the Specific Energy Levels for the System**\n\nNow, we substitute our specific single-particle energy, $\\epsilon_k = -\\mu$, into these general formulas.\n\n*   **For a system of Bosons:**\n    $Z_B = \\prod_{k=1}^{M} [1 - e^{-\\beta(-\\mu - \\mu)}]^{-1}$\n    $Z_B = \\prod_{k=1}^{M} [1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}]^{-1}$\n    Since the term in the product is the same for all $M$ states, the product becomes a power:\n    $Z_B = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n    (This result is valid for $e^{2\\beta\\mu} < 1$, which implies $\\mu < 0$).\n\n*   **For a system of Fermions:**\n    $Z_F = \\prod_{k=1}^{M} [1 + e^{-\\beta(-\\mu - \\mu)}]$\n    $Z_F = \\prod_{k=1}^{M} [1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}]$\n    Similarly, since the term is identical for all states, this becomes:\n    $Z_F = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles constituting the system. Let $M$ be the total number of available single-particle states.\n\n*   If the system consists of **bosons**, the partition function is $Z_B = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$.\n*   If the system consists of **fermions**, the partition function is $Z_F = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^M$.\n\nSince the question does not specify the particle statistics, both results are valid solutions.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer is derived from the step-by-step analysis above. Let M be the total number of single-particle states in the system and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. The partition function Z depends on the particle statistics.\n\nFor **Bosons**:\n$Z = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n\nFor **Fermions**:\n$Z = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\n<<<For Bosons, Z = (1 - exp(2*beta*mu))^(-M). For Fermions, Z = (1 + exp(2*beta*mu))^M.>>>"
