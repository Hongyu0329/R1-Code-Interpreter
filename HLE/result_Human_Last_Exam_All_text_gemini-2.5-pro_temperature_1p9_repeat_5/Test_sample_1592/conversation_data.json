    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the location of Waskaganish.**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community in northern Quebec. It is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. To analyze proximity, its geographical position is key.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the surrounding provinces and territories.**\nWaskaganish is in Quebec. The provinces and territories that border Quebec are:\n*   **Ontario:** to the west. The border runs north-south, including through the middle of James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** to the north. This includes a small land border on an island in the far north, but more relevantly, it includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, such as Akimiski Island.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** to the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** to the southeast.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the proximity of each candidate to Waskaganish.**\nThe question asks for the closest province or territory *outside of Quebec*. We need to compare the distance from Waskaganish to Ontario, Nunavut, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Visualize the map.** Waskaganish lies on the coast of James Bay. James Bay is a large body of water bordered by Quebec on the east and Ontario on the west. This immediately suggests that Ontario is a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **Comparison between Ontario and Nunavut:** This is the most critical comparison.\n    *   **Ontario:** The western shoreline of James Bay belongs to Ontario. Since Waskaganish is on the eastern shoreline, the shortest distance to Ontario is directly across the southern part of the bay to the Ontario mainland coast. This distance is relatively short, in the range of 80-90 kilometers.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The closest part of Nunavut to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island, which lies in the middle of James Bay, but significantly to the north of Waskaganish's latitude. The distance from Waskaganish to the southern tip of Akimiski Island is greater than the distance to the Ontario coast (over 100 kilometers).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Rule out distant provinces.** Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick are located far to the east and southeast of Waskaganish, respectively. They are clearly not the closest.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nBased on the geographical layout of James Bay, the mainland coast of Ontario is geographically closer to the community of Waskaganish than any part of the territory of Nunavut (like Akimiski Island) or any other province.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
