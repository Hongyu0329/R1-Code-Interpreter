    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights during randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Barbell Graph Structure**\n\n*   A barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge (a bridge).\n*   For a 10-node barbell graph, the most standard construction involves two cliques of 5 nodes each. Let's call them Clique A and Clique B.\n*   Clique A is a complete graph `K_5` with 5 nodes.\n*   Clique B is another complete graph `K_5` with 5 nodes.\n*   A single edge, known as the \"bottleneck edge,\" connects one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B. Let's name the nodes connected by this edge `u` (in Clique A) and `v` (in Clique B). So the bottleneck edge is `e_b = (u, v)`.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process**\n\n*   Randomized uniform gossiping is a distributed communication protocol. A single round or \"sampling\" step works as follows:\n    1.  A node is chosen uniformly at random from all `N` nodes in the graph. In our case, `N = 10`, so the probability of choosing any specific node is `1/10`.\n    2.  The chosen node then selects one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to communicate with. The edge between the chosen node and its selected neighbor is the \"sampled\" edge for this round.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Events Leading to Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n\n*   The bottleneck edge `e_b = (u, v)` is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n    1.  **Event 1:** Node `u` is chosen in the first step, and it then chooses its neighbor `v`.\n    2.  **Event 2:** Node `v` is chosen in the first step, and it then chooses its neighbor `u`.\n*   The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events: `P(sample e_b) = P(Event 1) + P(Event 2)`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Degree of the Bottleneck Nodes**\n\n*   To find the probability of a node choosing a specific neighbor, we need to know its degree (the number of neighbors it has).\n*   Consider node `u` in Clique A. It is connected to every other node in its 5-node clique, which accounts for `5 - 1 = 4` edges.\n*   Additionally, node `u` is connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge.\n*   Therefore, the total degree of node `u` is `degree(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   By symmetry, node `v` in Clique B is also connected to 4 nodes within its clique and to node `u`. So, `degree(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Probability of Each Event**\n\n*   **For Event 1 (choosing `u`, then `v`):**\n    *   The probability of choosing node `u` initially is `P(choose u) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given that `u` is chosen, the probability of it selecting its neighbor `v` is `1 / degree(u)`. Since `degree(u) = 5`, this probability is `1/5`.\n    *   So, `P(Event 1) = P(choose u) * P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **For Event 2 (choosing `v`, then `u`):**\n    *   The probability of choosing node `v` initially is `P(choose v) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given that `v` is chosen, the probability of it selecting its neighbor `u` is `1 / degree(v)`. Since `degree(v) = 5`, this probability is `1/5`.\n    *   So, `P(Event 2) = P(choose v) * P(v chooses u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Probability**\n\n*   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two exclusive events.\n*   `P(sample e_b) = P(Event 1) + P(Event 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50`.\n*   Simplifying the fraction, we get `1/25`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Barbell Graph Definition:** The result depends entirely on the graph's structure. The assumption of two 5-node cliques connected by a single edge is the most standard for a 10-node barbell, but other structures with bottlenecks exist. The problem statement implies this standard form.\n2.  **Gossiping Model:** The assumed model (pick a node, then a neighbor) is standard for \"uniform gossiping\". A different sampling process, like picking an edge uniformly from all edges, would yield a different result (1/21 in this case).\n3.  **Uniformity:** The problem states uniform weights and uniform gossiping. This translates to uniform probabilities at both the node selection and neighbor selection stages, which is crucial for the calculation.\n4.  **Degree Calculation:** An incorrect calculation of the degrees of the bottleneck nodes (`u` and `v`) would lead to an incorrect final probability. It's key to remember they have connections both inside their clique and across the bridge.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final probability is the sum of the probabilities of the two ways the bottleneck edge can be sampled, which is 2/50 or 1/25.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
