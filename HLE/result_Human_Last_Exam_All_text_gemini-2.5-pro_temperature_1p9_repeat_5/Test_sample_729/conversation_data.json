    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis\n\n**1. Understand the group in question: The Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^k$, denoted $Q_{2^k}$, is defined by the presentation:\n$Q_{2^k} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{k-1}} = 1, y^2 = x^{2^{k-2}}, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$ for $k \\ge 3$.\n\nFor the group of size 128, we have $|G| = 128 = 2^7$. This means we are dealing with $Q_{128}$, so $k=7$.\nThe presentation for our group $G = Q_{128}$ is:\n$G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, y^2 = x^{32}, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of $G$ can be written uniquely in the form $x^i$ for $0 \\le i \\le 63$, or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i \\le 63$.\n\n**2. Understand the term \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nA power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup of the form $G^n$, where $G^n$ is the subgroup generated by all the $n$-th powers of elements of $G$.\n$G^n = \\langle g^n \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set $\\{G^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\n**3. Relate Power Subgroups to the Group Exponent**\n\nA key property of power subgroups in any finite group $G$ is that $G^n = G^d$, where $d = \\text{gcd}(n, \\text{exp}(G))$ and $\\text{exp}(G)$ is the exponent of the group (the smallest integer $m>0$ such that $g^m=1$ for all $g \\in G$).\n\nThis means we don't need to check all integers $n$. We only need to find the power subgroups $G^d$ for all divisors $d$ of the exponent of $Q_{128}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Exponent of Q_128**\n\nThe exponent is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all elements in the group.\n*   **Orders of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$**: The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is cyclic of order 64. Its elements have orders that are divisors of 64, i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The maximum order is 64.\n*   **Orders of elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$**: These elements have the form $x^i y$. Let's find their order.\n    $(x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i (y x^i y^{-1}) y^2 = x^i (x^{-i}) y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    $(x^i y)^4 = ((x^i y)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    Since $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32} \\ne 1$, the order of every element $x^i y$ is exactly 4.\n\nThe exponent of $Q_{128}$ is $\\text{exp}(Q_{128}) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{orders of all elements}) = \\text{lcm}(64, 4) = 64$.\n\n**5. Identify Divisors and Compute the Power Subgroups**\n\nThe divisors of the exponent 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$. We will calculate the power subgroup $G^d$ for each of these seven divisors.\n\n*   **d = 1**: $G^1 = G = Q_{128}$. The order is 128.\n*   **d = 2**: $G^2 = \\langle g^2 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements $g=x^i$, the squares are $(x^i)^2 = x^{2i}$. These elements generate the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements $g=x^i y$, the squares are $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   So, $G^2 = \\langle \\langle x^2 \\rangle, x^{32} \\rangle$. Since $x^{32} = (x^{16})^2$, it is already an element of $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$. Thus, $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n*   **d = 4**: $G^4 = \\langle g^4 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    *   For $g=x^i$, the fourth powers are $(x^i)^4 = x^{4i}$. These generate $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   For $g=x^i y$, the fourth powers are $(x^i y)^4 = 1$.\n    *   So, $G^4 = \\langle \\langle x^4 \\rangle, 1 \\rangle = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n*   **d = 8**: $G^8 = \\langle g^8 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    *   $(x^i)^8 = x^{8i}$, which generate $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$.\n    *   $(x^i y)^8 = ((x^i y)^4)^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n    *   So, $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n*   **d = 16**: $G^{16} = \\langle g^{16} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   **d = 32**: $G^{32} = \\langle g^{32} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 2. It is also the center of $Q_{128}$.\n*   **d = 64**: $G^{64} = \\langle g^{64} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$. Since the exponent is 64, $g^{64}=1$ for all $g \\in G$. Thus, $G^{64} = \\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. This is the trivial subgroup of order 1.\n\n**6. Count the Distinct Subgroups**\n\nWe have found the following set of power subgroups:\n1.  $G^1 = Q_{128}$ (order 128)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\{1\\}$ (order 1)\n\nThese seven subgroups all have different orders, so they are all distinct.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are 7 distinct power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
