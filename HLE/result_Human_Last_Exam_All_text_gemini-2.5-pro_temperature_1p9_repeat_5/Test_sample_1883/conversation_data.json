    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of products A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactant and reaction type**\nThe reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The reaction is an electrocyclization under thermal conditions. This is a pericyclic reaction. The conjugated system involved in the cyclization is the octatetraene portion of the molecule, from C2 to C9. A new sigma bond will form between C2 and C9.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of π electrons and the mode of cyclization**\nThe reacting system is an octatetraene, which has 8 π electrons. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal electrocyclic reactions, systems with 4n π electrons (where n is an integer) undergo a **conrotatory** ring closure. Here, we have 8 π electrons, which is a 4n system with n=2. Therefore, the thermal reaction will proceed via a conrotatory pathway. This prediction is based on Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which considers the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the symmetry of the HOMO**\nFor an 8 π-electron system (octatetraene), the electrons occupy the first four molecular orbitals (\\(\\psi_1, \\psi_2, \\psi_3, \\psi_4\\)) in the ground state. The HOMO is \\(\\psi_4\\). For a linear polyene, the terminal p-orbitals of \\(\\psi_n\\) have opposite phases if n is even. Since n=4 is even, the p-orbitals at the termini (C2 and C9) of the HOMO have opposite symmetry. To achieve a bonding interaction (overlap of lobes with the same phase), the termini must rotate in a conrotatory fashion. This confirms the prediction from the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the stereochemistry of the substituents at the termini**\nThe stereochemistry of the final product depends on the orientation of the substituents on the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) and the direction of the conrotation. The substituents are methyl groups.\n*   **At C2:** The double bond C2=C3 has a (Z) configuration. This means the high-priority groups on C2 (the methyl group) and C3 (the rest of the carbon chain) are on the same side of the double bond. When the polyene chain coils into the reactive \"U\" or \"C\" shape, the methyl group at C2 will be positioned on the \"inside\" of the coil (let's call this 'in'), and the hydrogen atom will be on the \"outside\" ('out').\n*   **At C9:** The double bond C8=C9 has an (E) configuration. This means the high-priority groups on C8 (the rest of the carbon chain) and C9 (the methyl group) are on opposite sides of the double bond. In the reactive coiled conformation, the methyl group at C9 will be positioned on the \"outside\" of the coil ('out'), and the hydrogen atom will be on the \"inside\" ('in').\n\nSo, we have an **(in, out)** arrangement for the two methyl groups at the termini of the reacting system.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the stereochemistry of the product**\nWe need to combine the rotation mode (conrotatory) with the substituent geometry (in, out). There are two possible conrotatory pathways, which are enantiomeric: both ends rotating clockwise (CW) or both rotating counter-clockwise (CCW).\n1.  **CW Conrotation:**\n    *   At C2 (left end), the 'in' methyl group is pushed **up**.\n    *   At C9 (right end), the 'out' methyl group is pushed **down**.\n    The two methyl groups end up on opposite faces of the newly formed ring. This results in the **trans-isomer (B)**.\n2.  **CCW Conrotation:**\n    *   At C2 (left end), the 'in' methyl group is pushed **down**.\n    *   At C9 (right end), the 'out' methyl group is pushed **up**.\n    The two methyl groups again end up on opposite faces of the ring. This also results in the **trans-isomer (B)** (specifically, the enantiomer of the one formed by CW rotation).\n\n**Careful Point 1: FMO prediction for the given reactant**\nBased on a strict application of FMO theory to the specified reactant \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, both possible allowed thermal pathways (CW and CCW conrotation) lead exclusively to the *trans*-isomer B. The theory does not predict the formation of the *cis*-isomer A from this starting material.\n\n**Step 6: Address the discrepancy with the problem statement**\nThe question states that *both* cis-isomer A and trans-isomer B are formed. This experimental observation contradicts the theoretical prediction for the given reactant. There are two ways to approach this:\n*   **Interpretation 1 (Strict):** The question asks what FMO theory predicts for the given reactant. FMO theory predicts 100% formation of B and 0% formation of A. Therefore, the predicted ratio of A:B is 0:100.\n*   **Interpretation 2 (Mechanistic):** The observation that both A and B are formed suggests that there must be another reactive species present. A plausible explanation is that under the thermal conditions, the starting tetraene can undergo E/Z isomerization, establishing an equilibrium with other stereoisomers. Specifically, if the (8E)-isomer equilibrates with the (8Z)-isomer:\n    *   \\((...2Z, ...8E)\\)-tetraene (in, out) \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{conrotatory}}\\) **trans-isomer B** (as shown above).\n    *   \\((...2Z, ...8Z)\\)-tetraene (in, in) \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{conrotatory}}\\) **cis-isomer A**. (An `in,in` geometry with conrotation yields a cis product).\n\n**Step 7: Final Prediction of the Ratio based on the Mechanistic Interpretation**\nIf we assume the reaction proceeds via the two competing pathways described in Interpretation 2, FMO theory can be used to compare the activation energies of the two cyclization steps.\n*   **Transition State to B (from 8E-isomer):** The conrotation involves an 'in' methyl group and an 'in' hydrogen atom moving toward the same face of the forming ring. This results in some Me-H steric interaction.\n*   **Transition State to A (from 8Z-isomer):** The conrotation involves two 'in' methyl groups moving toward the same face of the forming ring. This results in a much larger Me-Me steric repulsion.\n\nThe steric repulsion in the transition state leading to cis-isomer A is significantly greater than that in the transition state leading to trans-isomer B. Therefore, Ea(A) > Ea(B), which means the rate of formation of B is faster than the rate of formation of A (k_B > k_A). This kinetic factor favors the formation of the trans-product B. (Additionally, the 8E-isomer is likely more thermodynamically stable than the 8Z-isomer, which also favors B). This analysis predicts that the ratio A:B should be less than 1, making B the major product.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a prediction based on FMO theory. The most rigorous and literal interpretation is that for the specific reactant given, FMO theory predicts a conrotatory reaction that can *only* produce the trans-isomer B. Thus, the theory predicts that no cis-isomer A is formed. The ratio of A to B is therefore predicted to be 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
