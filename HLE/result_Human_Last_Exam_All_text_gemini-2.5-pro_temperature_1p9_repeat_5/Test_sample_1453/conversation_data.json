    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Pattern**\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core interface where the helices pack together. The residues at the 'e' and 'g' positions are often charged and form electrostatic interactions between helices. To determine the oligomeric state, we first need to identify which amino acids occupy the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\nLet's examine the sequence for a repeating hydrophobic pattern:\nSequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nThe key hydrophobic residues are Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W). We look for a pattern where hydrophobic residues are spaced by two and then three other residues (i.e., at positions `i`, `i+4`, `i+7`, `i+11`, etc., corresponding to positions d, a, d, a...).\n\nLet's test the alignment by assigning the first major hydrophobic residue, Isoleucine (I) at position 3, to the 'd' position.\n*   If `I` at position 3 is 'd', then the next 'a' position should be four residues later, at position 7 (`d` -> e -> f -> g -> `a`). Position 7 is `L` (Leucine). This is a hydrophobic residue, so this alignment looks promising.\n*   The next 'd' position would be three residues after that, at position 10. Position 10 is `I`. This fits.\n*   The next 'a' position would be at position 14. Position 14 is `L`. This fits.\n*   The next 'd' position is at position 17 (`I`). This fits.\n*   The next 'a' position is at position 21 (`L`). This fits.\n*   The next 'd' position is at position 24 (`W`, Tryptophan). Tryptophan is a large hydrophobic residue, which is plausible in a core position.\n*   The next 'a' position is at position 28 (`L`). This fits.\n*   The next 'd' position would be at position 31, which is `K` (Lysine). Lysine is charged and hydrophilic, making it highly unfavorable in a hydrophobic core. This indicates that the regular coiled-coil structure likely terminates before this residue.\n\nSo, the repeating core of the coiled-coil is defined by the following 'a' and 'd' positions:\n*   **'a' positions:** L, L, L, L\n*   **'d' positions:** I, I, I, W\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Core Residues based on Knobs-into-Holes Packing**\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is heavily influenced by the steric properties (shape and size) of the side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions, which pack together in a \"knobs-into-holes\" fashion. The key difference here is between Leucine (L) and Isoleucine (I).\n\n*   **Leucine (L):** The side chain is branched at the gamma-carbon (`-CH2-CH(CH3)2`). The bulk of the side chain is relatively far from the protein backbone.\n*   **Isoleucine (I):** The side chain is branched at the beta-carbon (`-CH(CH3)CH2CH3`). The bulk is very close to the protein backbone, making it sterically more constrained.\n\nThese structural differences lead to strong preferences for specific oligomeric states (based on seminal work by Harbury, Woolfson, and others):\n\n*   **Dimer (2-helix bundle):** Favored by `Leucine` at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Trimer (3-helix bundle):** Favored by `Isoleucine` at the 'a' position and `Leucine` at the 'd' position. The steric bulk of Ile at the 'a' position fits neatly into the packing arrangement of a trimer.\n*   **Tetramer (4-helix bundle):** Favored by `Leucine` at the 'a' position and `Isoleucine` at the 'd' position. The geometry of a tetramer better accommodates the bulky beta-branched Isoleucine at the 'd' position and the less constrained Leucine at the 'a' position.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Rules to the Given Sequence**\nOur analysis of the sequence showed a consistent pattern:\n*   **Dominant 'a' position residue: Leucine (L)**\n*   **Dominant 'd' position residue: Isoleucine (I)** (and W, which is also large and hydrophobic)\n\nThis pattern (`'a'=L`, `'d'=I`) is the canonical signature for a **tetrameric** coiled-coil. The packing of these specific residues is most efficient and sterically favorable in a four-helix bundle.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBased on the identity of the amino acids in the core 'a' and 'd' positions and the principles of knobs-into-holes packing efficiency, the sequence is predicted to form a tetramer. An oligomeric state of 4 corresponds to a tetramer.\n\nFinal Answer is 4. This corresponds to choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
