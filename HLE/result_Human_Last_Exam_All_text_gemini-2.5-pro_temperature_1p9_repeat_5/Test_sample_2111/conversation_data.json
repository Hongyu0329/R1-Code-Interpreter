    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for a specific \"conceptual entity.\" The key clues are:\n    *   It's an assertion by Paul Morand.\n    *   It was quoted by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   Braudel's perspective is global.\n    *   The core metaphor is that this entity should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   An example of this entity is \"the symbol of a nation.\"\n\n2.  **Locate the source:** The reference comes from Fernand Braudel's work, specifically the preface to his book *A History of Civilizations* (1963). In this preface, titled \"The History of Civilizations: The Past Explains the Present,\" Braudel sets out his approach to the subject.\n\n3.  **Analyze the specific quote and its context:** Braudel begins his discussion by trying to define the subject of his book. To do so, he directly quotes Paul Morand. The exact quotation from Braudel's text is:\n    > \"A civilization,\" Paul Morand wrote in 1941, \"is a reality that has to be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n\n4.  **Connect the quote to the other clues:**\n    *   **The entity:** The quote explicitly names the entity as \"a civilization.\"\n    *   **The metaphor:** Morand states this civilization must be \"inscribed within a sphere.\" A sphere is a representation of the globe, so this means a civilization must be understood in its global context, which perfectly aligns with Braudel's emphasis on a global historical perspective.\n    *   **The example of a nation:** Immediately after quoting Morand, Braudel extends this principle. He writes, \"...what is the good of any symbol (and a nation, as we all know, is a symbol) if its full significance can not be plotted on the map of the world...?\" Here, Braudel uses the \"nation\" as another example to reinforce the same idea he introduced with Morand's quote about \"civilization.\" He argues that just like a civilization, a nation cannot be understood in isolation but must be placed in a wider, global context.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and conclude:** The conceptual entity that Paul Morand asserted should be \"inscribed within a sphere,\" as quoted by Fernand Braudel, is a **civilization**. The nation is used by Braudel as a supporting example to illustrate this larger principle.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the primary entity being discussed in the original quote and the subsequent example used for clarification.\n*   The original quote from Morand names \"civilization\" as the entity.\n*   The reference to a \"nation\" is Braudel's own addition to elaborate on the same principle, showing it applies to other large symbolic entities as well. The question asks for the entity from Morand's assertion that Braudel quoted.\n\n***\n\nThe conceptual entity that Fernand Braudel, quoting Paul Morand, says should be inscribed within a sphere is a **civilization**.\n\n<<<civilization>>>"
