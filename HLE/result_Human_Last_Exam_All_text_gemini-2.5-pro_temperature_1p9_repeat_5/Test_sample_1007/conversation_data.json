    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine which ballet step has the same ending and starting leg position. For this analysis, let's assume the standard starting position for these steps is the fifth position.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Question:**\nThe core of the question is to identify a ballet step from the given list where the configuration of the legs (which foot is in front/back, the position itself) is identical at the beginning and at the end of the movement.\n\n**2. Analyze Answer Choice A: Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Entrechat\" means a weaving or inter-lacing jump. The number \"six\" indicates the number of movements (openings and crossings) of the legs in the air. Even-numbered entrechats (like quatre, six, huit) start and land on two feet. A key characteristic of even-numbered entrechats is that they land in the same fifth position they started from, with the same foot in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the right foot in front.\n*   **Careful Point:** Even-numbered entrechats are designed to land without changing feet. Odd-numbered ones land on one foot. Therefore, the start and end positions are identical.\n\n**3. Analyze Answer Choice B: Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Échappé\" means to escape; it's a jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second). \"Battu\" means it's beaten (the legs strike together). The most crucial word here is \"changé,\" which means \"changed.\"\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer jumps from fifth to second and then closes back to fifth, but because of \"changé,\" the feet switch places. The left foot, which started in the back, will now land in the front.\n*   **Careful Point:** The word \"changé\" explicitly states that the feet change position.\n\n**4. Analyze Answer Choice C: Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means to assemble. The dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air before landing in fifth position. For example, in an `assemblé dessus` (over), the back leg brushes to the side and lands in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** The working leg almost always changes its relationship to the supporting leg, resulting in a changed fifth position upon landing.\n*   **Careful Point:** Assemblé is a traveling step that fundamentally involves re-arranging the legs to land in a new position, even if it's the same type of position (fifth).\n\n**5. Analyze Answer Choice D: Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means to glide. \"Derrière\" means the closing action is to the back. In a standard `glissade derrière`, the front foot (right foot) glides to the side, and the other leg (left foot) closes behind it.\n*   **Ending Position:** The left foot has now closed behind the right foot. This means the right foot is still in front, but the original left foot is now behind it. Wait, let's re-evaluate. A more standard glissade derrière: the *back* foot initiates the glide, and the *front* foot closes behind.\n    *   Start: R foot front.\n    *   The back foot (L) glides out to the side.\n    *   The R foot follows, closing *derrière* (behind) the L foot.\n    *   The final position is fifth with the left foot now in front. The position has changed. This is a `glissade changé`.\n*   **Careful Point:** Unless specified as \"non-changé\" (unchanged), a glissade is typically a \"changé\" step, meaning it is used to switch the feet.\n\n**6. Analyze Answer Choice E: Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step similar to a `pas de chat` with ronds de jambe. The dancer jumps, performing a circle with the starting front leg, and then another circle with the other leg as it is brought up, landing with the feet switched.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but the foot that started in front (right) now closes to the back, and the foot that started in back (left) now closes to the front. The position is changed.\n*   **Careful Point:** A gargouillade is inherently a step that involves changing the feet's front/back orientation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, only **Entrechat six** is defined as a step that starts in a specific fifth position and ends in the exact same fifth position, with the same foot remaining in front. All other options involve changing the feet's position (`changé`) or are inherently traveling/transitional steps that result in a new leg configuration.\n\n<<<A>>>"
