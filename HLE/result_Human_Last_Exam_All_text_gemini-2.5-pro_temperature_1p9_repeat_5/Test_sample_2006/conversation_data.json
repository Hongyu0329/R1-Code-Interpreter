    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core task is to solve a riddle presented as a haiku with the title \"The Bays\". The title itself is a question, implying we need to identify specific bays. The haiku's three lines are clues, likely one for each bay. The final answer must be presented in alphabetical order.\n\n**2. Analyze the Haiku - Line by Line**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This line combines the month \"August\" with a \"tempest\" (a violent storm). This points towards a place named in connection with the month of August. St. Augustine of Hippo's feast day is August 28th. The city of St. Augustine, Florida, was so named by Spanish admiral Pedro Menéndez de Avilés because his crew first sighted land on this day in 1565. This city is located on a bay. The \"tempest\" can also allude to the violent history of the bay, whose Spanish name means \"slaughters\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to connect \"August\" to the historical/religious figure of St. Augustine to find the location.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The bay is **Matanzas Bay**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" is a simple calculation: 2 x 15 = 30. We need to find a bay associated with the number 30 and a major historical event described as \"winds of change\". The number 30 corresponds to the approximate latitude (30.4° N) of a significant bay in the United States. The Battle of Mobile Bay, a major naval battle during the American Civil War in August 1864, was a pivotal Union victory that helped close a key Confederate port, representing a significant \"wind of change\" in the war.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The number 30 is the key, and it relates to geography (latitude) rather than a date or a quantity of items.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The bay is **Mobile Bay**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This clue asks us to identify a bay where a figure considered \"divine\" has \"yielded\" (surrendered or given way). In Japanese culture, the Emperor was historically considered a living god or \"divine one\". At the end of World War II, Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced his country's surrender (\"yielded\"). The formal signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri, which was anchored in a specific bay.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Understanding the historical and cultural context of the divine status of the Japanese Emperor is essential to solving this clue. \"Yields\" here means \"surrenders\".\n    *   **Conclusion:** The bay is **Tokyo Bay**.\n\n**3. Synthesize and Format the Final Answer**\n*   **Step 1: List the identified bays.**\n    1.  Matanzas Bay\n    2.  Mobile Bay\n    3.  Tokyo Bay\n*   **Step 2: Fulfill the final instruction.** The question asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n*   **Step 3: Sort the list.**\n    1.  Matanzas Bay\n    2.  Mobile Bay\n    3.  Tokyo Bay\n    This list is already in alphabetical order.\n\n<<<Matanzas Bay, Mobile Bay, Tokyo Bay>>>"
