    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of involutions in the group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group PSU(4, q)**\nThe group in question is the Projective Special Unitary group PSU(n, q) with parameters $n=4$ and $q=997$. The number 997 is a prime number.\nThe group is defined as the quotient group $\\text{PSU}(n, q) = \\text{SU}(n, q) / Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$, where $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ is the Special Unitary group and $Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$ is its center.\n-   $\\text{U}(n,q)$ is the group of $n \\times n$ matrices $A$ with entries in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ that preserve a non-degenerate Hermitian form, i.e., $A A^{*T} = I$, where $A^{*T}$ is the conjugate transpose of $A$. The conjugation is the Galois automorphism $x \\mapsto x^q$ of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n-   $\\text{SU}(n,q)$ is the subgroup of $\\text{U}(n,q)$ containing matrices with determinant 1.\n-   $Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^2}^*$, $\\lambda^n = 1$, and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. This is equivalent to $\\lambda^{\\gcd(n, q+1)}=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize involutions in PSU(4, 997)**\nLet $x$ be an involution in $\\text{PSU}(4, 997)$. This means $x \\neq 1$ and $x^2 = 1$. Let $\\pi: \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\to \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ be the canonical projection. An element $x \\in \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ is a coset $A \\cdot Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$ for some $A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$.\nThe condition $x^2=1$ translates to $A^2 \\in Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$.\nThe condition $x \\neq 1$ translates to $A \\notin Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the center of SU(4, 997)**\nThe order of the center $Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$ is $d = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\nFor our group, $n=4$ and $q=997$.\n$d = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$.\nSince $998 = 2 \\times 499$ and 499 is a prime, $\\gcd(4, 998) = \\gcd(2^2, 2 \\times 499) = 2$.\nSo, $Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$ is a group of order 2. Its elements are $\\{\\I, -\\I\\}$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the corresponding elements in SU(4, 997)**\nWe need to count the number of elements $A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that $A^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}$ and $A \\notin \\{I, -I\\}$. This breaks down into two disjoint cases for $A$:\n1.  $A^2 = I$ and $A \\neq \\pm I$. These are the non-central involutions in $\\text{SU}(4, 997)$.\n2.  $A^2 = -I$. If such an $A$ exists, $A \\notin Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$ because $(\\pm I)^2=I \\neq -I$ (as the characteristic is not 2).\n\nThe set of all such matrices, let's call it $\\mathcal{X}$, is the union of the sets from these two cases. For each $A \\in \\mathcal{X}$, the element $-A$ is also in $\\mathcal{X}$ (since $(-A)^2=A^2$). The pair $\\{A, -A\\}$ maps to the same coset $A \\cdot Z = (-A) \\cdot Z$ in $\\text{PSU}(4, 997)$. Thus, the number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ is $|\\mathcal{X}|/2$.\n\n**Step 5: Count elements of the first type ($A^2=I$, $A \\neq \\pm I$)**\nAn involution $A$ in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$ is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. The condition $\\det(A)=1$ implies that the number of eigenvalues equal to $-1$ must be even. Let the dimension of the eigenspace for eigenvalue 1 be $k$. Then the type of the involution is $(k, 4-k)$.\nThe determinant is $(-1)^{4-k}$, which must be 1. So $4-k$ must be even, meaning $k$ is even.\nThe possible values for $k$ are $0, 2, 4$.\n-   $k=4$: $A=I$ (the identity matrix). This is in the center.\n-   $k=0$: $A=-I$. This is also in the center.\n-   $k=2$: These are the non-central involutions. They all belong to a single conjugacy class in $\\text{U}(4, q)$. The number of such elements is the size of this conjugacy class.\nThe size of this class is given by the formula $\\frac{|U(4,q)|}{|U(2,q)||U(2,q)|}$. Let's denote this by $N_1$.\nUsing the formula $|U(m,q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2}\\prod_{i=1}^{m}(q^i - (-1)^i)$:\n$|U(4,q)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$\n$|U(2,q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)$\n$N_1 = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{[q(q+1)(q^2-1)]^2} = \\frac{q^4(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)}$\n$N_1 = \\frac{q^4(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)$.\n\n**Step 6: Count elements of the second type ($A^2=-I$)**\nThe existence and number of such elements depend on $q \\pmod 4$. We have $q=997$.\n$997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1$, so $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nFor $n=2m$ and $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the number of elements $A \\in \\text{SU}(n,q)$ such that $A^2=-I$ is given by the formula $\\frac{|\\text{SU}(n,q)|}{|\\text{Sp}(n,q)|}$. Let's denote this by $N_2$.\nHere $n=4$, so we have:\n$N_2 = \\frac{|\\text{SU}(4,q)|}{|\\text{Sp}(4,q)|}$\nUsing the formulas:\n$|\\text{SU}(4,q)| = \\frac{|U(4,q)|}{q+1} = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q+1} = q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$.\n$|\\text{Sp}(4,q)| = q^{2^2}(q^2-1)(q^4-1) = q^4(q^2-1)(q^4-1)$.\n$N_2 = \\frac{q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q^4(q^2-1)(q^4-1)} = q^2(q^3+1)$.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final number**\nThe total number of matrices in $\\mathcal{X}$ is $|\\mathcal{X}| = N_1 + N_2$.\n$|\\mathcal{X}| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^2(q^3+1)$\nWe can factor out $q^2(q^2-q+1)$ from both terms, since $q^3+1 = (q+1)(q^2-q+1)$:\n$|\\mathcal{X}| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^2(q+1)(q^2-q+1)$\n$|\\mathcal{X}| = q^2(q^2-q+1) [q^2(q^2+1) + (q+1)]$\n$|\\mathcal{X}| = q^2(q^2-q+1) (q^4+q^2+q+1)$\n\nThe number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is $|\\mathcal{X}|/2$.\nNumber of involutions $= \\frac{1}{2} q^2(q^2-q+1)(q^4+q^2+q+1)$.\nSubstituting $q=997$:\nNumber of involutions $= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^2 \\cdot (997^2 - 997 + 1) \\cdot (997^4 + 997^2 + 997 + 1)$.\nAs $q=997$ is odd, $q^2$ is odd. The term $q^2-q+1$ is odd-odd+odd=odd. The term $q^4+q^2+q+1$ is odd+odd+odd+odd=even. The product is therefore an even integer, so division by 2 yields an integer.\n\nThe question asks for the number. A numerical calculation would result in a very large number (on the order of $10^{26}$). The standard interpretation in such a context is that the formula expressing the number is the desired answer.\n\nFinal Answer: Let $q=997$. The number of involutions in PSU(4,q) is given by the formula:\n$\\frac{1}{2} q^2(q^2-q+1)(q^4+q^2+q+1)$\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^2 (997^2 - 997 + 1) (997^4 + 997^2 + 997 + 1)$\n\nLet's compute the factors:\n$997^2 = 994009$\n$997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013$\n$997^4 = (994009)^2 = 988053848081$\n$997^4 + 997^2 + 997 + 1 = 988053848081 + 994009 + 997 + 1 = 988054843088$\n\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 994009 \\cdot 993013 \\cdot 988054843088$\n$= 994009 \\cdot 993013 \\cdot 494027421544$\n$= 987063167017 \\cdot 494027421544$\n$= 487637171485121487688048$\n\nThe final answer is this integer. However, usually the formula itself is accepted as the answer. Let me provide the formulaic answer first as this is typical. The direct computation could lead to transcription errors and might not be the spirit of the question. I will give the formula.\n\nThe final answer is the expression in terms of $q=997$.\nNumber $= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^2(997^2-997+1)(997^4+997^2+997+1)$\n\nFinal computation:\n$994009 \\times 993013 \\times (988054843088 / 2) = 987063167017 \\times 494027421544 = 487637171485121487688048$."
