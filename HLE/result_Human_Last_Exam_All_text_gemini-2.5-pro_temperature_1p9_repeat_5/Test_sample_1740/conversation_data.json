    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The goal is to find the total number of members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans (*Homo sapiens*).\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 family\" and \"member\":**\n    *   The **let-7 family** is a group of miRNAs that share a conserved sequence of nucleotides at their 5' end, known as the \"seed sequence.\" This shared sequence means they are predicted to regulate a similar set of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs).\n    *   The term **\"member\"** can be ambiguous. It could refer to:\n        *   **A) The precursor genes (pre-miRNAs):** These are the hairpin-shaped RNA molecules transcribed from the genome that are later processed into mature miRNAs. Different genes can exist for the same or very similar miRNAs.\n        *   **B) The unique mature miRNAs:** These are the final, ~22-nucleotide functional molecules. Multiple precursor genes can sometimes be processed into the exact same mature miRNA sequence.\n\n3.  **Identify the Authoritative Source:** The primary and most reliable database for miRNA sequences and annotation is **miRBase**. Scientific literature, especially recent review articles in reputable journals, also provides this information, typically based on miRBase data.\n\n4.  **Consult the Authoritative Source (miRBase):** We will analyze the count based on the number of distinct precursor genes, as this is a common and unambiguous way to count family members cited in scientific literature. According to the current miRBase release (v22.1), the human let-7 family consists of the following precursor genes:\n    *   `hsa-let-7a` is encoded by three separate genes: `hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, and `hsa-let-7a-3`.\n    *   `hsa-let-7b` is encoded by one gene: `hsa-let-7b`.\n    *   `hsa-let-7c` is encoded by one gene: `hsa-let-7c`.\n    *   `hsa-let-7d` is encoded by one gene: `hsa-let-7d`.\n    *   `hsa-let-7e` is encoded by one gene: `hsa-let-7e`.\n    *   `hsa-let-7f` is encoded by two separate genes: `hsa-let-7f-1` and `hsa-let-7f-2`.\n    *   `hsa-let-7g` is encoded by one gene: `hsa-let-7g`.\n    *   `hsa-let-7i` is encoded by one gene: `hsa-let-7i`.\n    *   `hsa-mir-98` is also a canonical member of the let-7 family due to its seed sequence and is encoded by one gene: `hsa-mir-98`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Genes:** Now, we sum the number of identified precursor genes:\n    *   `let-7a`: 3 genes\n    *   `let-7b`: 1 gene\n    *   `let-7c`: 1 gene\n    *   `let-7d`: 1 gene\n    *   `let-7e`: 1 gene\n    *   `let-7f`: 2 genes\n    *   `let-7g`: 1 gene\n    *   `let-7i`: 1 gene\n    *   `mir-98`: 1 gene\n    *   **Total = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Precursor Genes vs. Mature miRNAs:** It's crucial to distinguish between the two. The 12 precursor genes give rise to 9 distinct types of mature miRNAs (let-7a, -7b, -7c, -7d, -7e, -7f, -7g, -7i, and miR-98). Since the genes themselves are the distinct identified loci, counting them is the standard approach.\n*   **Source and Version:** The number is based on the current consensus in molecular biology, as cataloged by miRBase. This number has been stable for many years.\n*   **Inclusion of miR-98:** It's important to remember that `miR-98` is a core member of the let-7 family, even though its name does not start with \"let-7.\"\n*   **Exclusion of Others:** Some other miRNAs like `miR-202` and `miR-4500` have been proposed as let-7 family members, but they are not universally accepted or listed in the canonical family page on miRBase. The count of 12 represents the well-established, canonical members.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the number of distinct precursor miRNA genes identified and cataloged in the primary miRBase repository, there are 12 members in the human let-7 family.\n\n<<<12>>>"
