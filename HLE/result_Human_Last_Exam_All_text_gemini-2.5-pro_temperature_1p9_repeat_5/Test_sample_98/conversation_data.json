    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup and the object.**\n*   The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, for every face, there is an identical face on the opposite side that is perfectly parallel to it. So, if the tank rests on a triangular face, its top surface is also a parallel triangular face.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the \"half-filled\" condition.**\n*   \"Half-filled\" refers to the volume. The volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   A regular icosahedron is a centrally symmetric object. This means it has a geometric center, and for any point on its surface, there is an identical point on the opposite side an equal distance from the center.\n*   Any plane that passes through the center of a centrally symmetric object will divide its volume into two equal halves.\n*   The surface of a liquid at rest under gravity is a horizontal plane.\n*   Combining these facts, when the icosahedron is half-filled, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the symmetry of the icosahedron in this orientation.**\n*   When an icosahedron stands on one of its faces, the vertical line passing through the center of the base face and the center of the parallel top face is an axis of symmetry.\n*   If you rotate the icosahedron by 120 degrees (or 240 degrees) around this vertical axis, it appears unchanged. This is known as a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis.\n*   The water surface is a horizontal plane, which is perpendicular to this 3-fold symmetry axis.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the shape of the cross-section.**\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section formed by slicing the icosahedron with this central, horizontal plane.\n*   Since the plane is perpendicular to a 3-fold rotational axis, the resulting shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   Let's consider the arrangement of the icosahedron's edges that this plane will cut. The vertices of the icosahedron in this orientation are located at four different height levels. There are 3 vertices on the bottom plane, 3 on a plane just above, 3 on a plane just below the top, and 3 on the top plane.\n*   The central horizontal plane lies exactly between the two middle layers of vertices. It does not pass through any vertex.\n*   The plane will therefore intersect all the edges that connect the lower-middle layer of 3 vertices with the upper-middle layer of 3 vertices.\n*   Each of the 3 vertices in the lower-middle layer is connected by an edge to two vertices in the upper-middle layer. This makes a total of 3 x 2 = 6 edges connecting the two middle layers.\n*   Since the central plane cuts through these 6 edges, the resulting cross-section will be a polygon with 6 sidesâ€”a hexagon.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the properties of the hexagon.**\n*   As established in Step 3, the shape must have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   As established in Step 2, the shape is centrally symmetric because the cutting plane passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n*   A hexagon that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must be a **regular hexagon** (all sides are equal in length, and all internal angles are equal).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen a regular icosahedron tank standing on a face is half-filled with water, the water's surface forms a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron. The intersection of this plane with the icosahedron is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
