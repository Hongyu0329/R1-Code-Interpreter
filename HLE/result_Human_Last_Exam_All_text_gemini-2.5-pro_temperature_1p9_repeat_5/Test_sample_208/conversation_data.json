    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the radius of the circle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nThe problem asks for the radius of the smallest possible circle that can enclose fourteen smaller, non-overlapping circles, each with a radius of one. This is a classic mathematical problem known as the \"circle packing problem\". The phrase \"tightly packed\" implies finding the minimal radius for the larger, containing circle.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Complexity**\nFor a small number of circles (like N=1, 2, 3, or 7), the arrangement is often simple and symmetrical, and the radius can be calculated using basic geometry. However, for N=14, the optimal arrangement is not obvious and does not form a simple, regular pattern. The solution is not derivable from a straightforward formula. The optimal packings for such problems have been determined through complex geometrical analysis and computer-assisted proofs.\n\n**Step 3: Consult Known Results**\nWe must refer to the established results for the circle packing problem. Mathematicians have extensively studied and tabulated the densest packing configurations for various numbers of circles. These results are typically given as the ratio of the radius of the large circle (R) to the radius of the small circles (r). For packing 14 circles (N=14), the accepted optimal configuration was conjectured by P. G. Pirl in 1969.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Radius Ratio for N=14**\nAccording to reliable mathematical sources and databases on circle packing (such as the work by F. Fodor or Erich's Packing Center), the ratio of the radii for the densest packing of 14 circles is:\n`R / r ≈ 3.9786968...`\nThis value represents the minimum possible ratio `R/r` to fit 14 circles.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Radius of the Large Circle**\nThe problem states that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`. We can now calculate the radius `R` of the large circle.\n`R = r * (R / r)`\n`R = 1 * 3.9786968...`\n`R ≈ 3.9786968...`\n\n**Step 6: Round to the Required Number of Significant Digits**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\nThe value is `3.9786968...`\n1.  The first significant digit is 3.\n2.  The second significant digit is 9.\n3.  The third significant digit is 7.\n4.  The fourth significant digit is 8.\nThe digit immediately following the fourth significant digit is `6`. Since this digit is 5 or greater, we must round up the fourth significant digit.\nRounding up the `8` gives `9`.\nTherefore, the radius rounded to 4 significant digits is `3.979`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Do not guess the arrangement:** The optimal packing for N=14 is non-intuitive. It does not feature a central circle. It consists of a central cluster of 4 circles surrounded by an outer ring of 10. Attempting to derive the radius from an assumed incorrect pattern (e.g., a central circle with 13 around it) would lead to a wrong answer.\n*   **Use reliable sources:** The radius ratio for circle packing problems should be taken from established mathematical research to ensure accuracy.\n*   **Rounding rules:** Pay close attention to the rules for rounding to a specific number of significant digits. The digit after the last required significant digit determines whether you round up or not.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n1.  Problem Type: Circle packing, N=14, r=1.\n2.  Find known ratio: `R/r` for N=14 is `≈ 3.9786968`.\n3.  Calculate R: `R = 1 * 3.9786968... = 3.9786968...`\n4.  Round to 4 significant digits: The number is `3.9786...`. The 5th digit is 6, so we round the 4th digit (8) up to 9. The result is 3.979.\n\n<<<3.979>>>"
