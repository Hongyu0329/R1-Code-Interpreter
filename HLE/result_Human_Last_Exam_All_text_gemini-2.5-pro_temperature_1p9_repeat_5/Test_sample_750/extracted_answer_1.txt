1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.
2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions: for each integer $k \le -1$, there is a unique solution of the form $z_k=iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real number satisfying $-y = e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)}$. All these solutions lie on the negative imaginary axis.
3.  An infinite set of other complex solutions $z=x+iy$ (with $x,y \ne 0$).
