    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the equation in terms of standard functions**\nThe right hand side of the equation involves complex exponentiation, $i^z$. By definition, for complex numbers $a$ and $b$, $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$.\nHere, $a=i$ and $b=z$.\nThe natural logarithm of $i$, $\\ln i$, is a multi-valued function in the complex plane.\nWe first write $i$ in polar form: $i = 1 \\cdot e^{i\\pi/2}$.\nSo, $\\ln i = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nEach value of $k$ corresponds to a different branch of the logarithm function. A solution $z$ must satisfy the equation for at least one integer value of $k$.\n\nLet's denote $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. So $\\ln i = iA_k$.\nThe original equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\ln i} = e^{z (i A_k)}$\n$z \\cdot i = e^{izA_k}$\n\n**Step 2: Solve for real solutions**\nLet's assume $z$ is a real number, so $z=x$ where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$x \\cdot i = e^{ixA_k}$\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$, the right side is:\n$xi = \\cos(xA_k) + i\\sin(xA_k)$\nFor two complex numbers to be equal, their real and imaginary parts must be equal.\nEquating the real parts:\n$0 = \\cos(xA_k)$ (1)\nEquating the imaginary parts:\n$x = \\sin(xA_k)$ (2)\n\nFrom equation (1), for $\\cos(xA_k)$ to be zero, the argument $xA_k$ must be an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$.\n$xA_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor such an argument, the sine function takes values:\n$\\sin(xA_k) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$.\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n$x = (-1)^n$.\nThis means that any real solution must be either $x=1$ (for even $n$) or $x=-1$ (for odd $n$).\n\nLet's check these two possibilities:\n*   If $z = 1$ ($x=1$):\n    LHS: $1 \\cdot i = i$.\n    RHS: $i^1 = i$.\n    LHS = RHS. So, $z=1$ is a solution. This is consistent with our derivation. For $x=1$, we require $\\sin(A_k)=1$. Since $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi$, $\\sin(A_k)=1$ for all integers $k$. So $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $z = -1$ ($x=-1$):\n    LHS: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$.\n    RHS: $i^{-1} = \\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{-i}{-i^2} = -i$.\n    LHS = RHS. So, $z=-1$ is a solution. This is also consistent. For $x=-1$, we require $-1=\\sin(-A_k)=-\\sin(A_k)$, which implies $\\sin(A_k)=1$. This is true for all integers $k$.\n\nSo, we have found two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for purely imaginary solutions**\nLet's assume $z$ is a purely imaginary number, so $z=iy$ where $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $y \\ne 0$.\nThe equation $z \\cdot i = e^{izA_k}$ becomes:\n$(iy) \\cdot i = e^{i(iy)A_k}$\n$i^2y = e^{i^2yA_k}$\n$-y = e^{-yA_k}$ where $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\nWe need to find real values of $y$ that solve this equation for some integer $k$. Let's analyze the function $f(y) = e^{-yA_k} + y$. We are looking for roots of $f(y)=0$.\n*   **Case a: $k \\ge 0$.**\n    In this case, $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\dots$ are all positive. So $A_k>0$.\n    If $y>0$, LHS ($-y$) is negative, but RHS ($e^{-yA_k}$) is positive. No solution.\n    If $y<0$, let $y = -a$ for $a>0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{aA_k}$.\n    Let's analyze $h(a) = e^{aA_k}-a$. We want to see if $h(a)=0$ has solutions for $a>0$.\n    $h(0) = e^0-0=1$. The derivative is $h'(a)=A_ke^{aA_k}-1$.\n    Since $k \\ge 0$, $A_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1$. So for $a>0$, $A_ke^{aA_k} > 1 \\cdot e^0=1$. Thus $h'(a)>0$ for all $a>0$.\n    This means $h(a)$ starts at $h(0)=1$ and is strictly increasing for $a>0$. Therefore, $h(a)$ is always positive, and there are no solutions for $a>0$.\n    So, there are no purely imaginary solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   **Case b: $k \\le -1$.**\n    In this case, $A_k = -\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, -\\frac{7\\pi}{2}, \\dots$ are all negative. Let $C_k = -A_k > 0$.\n    The equation becomes $-y = e^{yC_k}$.\n    If $y>0$, LHS is negative while RHS ($e^{yC_k}$) is positive (and greater than 1). No solution.\n    If $y<0$, let $y = -a$ for $a>0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{-aC_k}$.\n    Consider the functions $g_1(a)=a$ and $g_2(a)=e^{-aC_k}$.\n    $g_1(0)=0$ and $g_1(a)$ is an increasing line.\n    $g_2(0)=1$ and $g_2(a)$ is a strictly decreasing function (since $C_k>0$), approaching 0 as $a \\to \\infty$.\n    A simple graphical analysis shows that there is exactly one intersection point for $a>0$. Thus, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there exists a unique positive value $a_k$ satisfying $a_k=e^{-a_kC_k}$.\n    This corresponds to a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k = -ia_k$.\n\nSo, there is an infinite family of purely imaginary solutions, one for each negative integer $k \\le -1$. These solutions all lie on the negative imaginary axis.\n\n**Step 4: Other complex solutions**\nThere are other complex solutions $z=x+iy$ where neither $x$ nor $y$ is zero. The complete set of solutions can be expressed compactly using the Lambert W function. The derivation leads to the form:\n$z_{k,j} = i \\frac{W_j(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$\nwhere $k, j$ are integers and $W_j$ is the $j$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\nThe real and purely imaginary solutions discussed above are specific instances of this general formula. For example, for $k \\le -1$ and $j=0$ (the principal branch), we get the purely imaginary solutions. For certain pairs of $(k,j)$, we get the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$. Other pairs of $(k,j)$ yield complex solutions that are not real or purely imaginary.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\nThe equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ has the following solutions:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions: for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution of the form $z_k=iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real number satisfying $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$. All these solutions lie on the negative imaginary axis.\n3.  An infinite set of other complex solutions $z=x+iy$ (with $x,y \\ne 0$)."
