    "Here is a step-by-step scansion of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**The Line:**\nverum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\n\n**Analysis Principles:**\n*   A foot in hexameter is either a dactyl (— u u, long-short-short) or a spondee (— —, long-long).\n*   The 5th foot is almost always a dactyl. The 6th foot is a spondee (or trochee).\n*   A vowel is long by nature (e.g., `ī` in `equī`) or by position (when followed by two or more consonants, like the `e` in `verum`).\n*   **Elision:** A final vowel (or `-m`) is usually dropped before a word beginning with a vowel (or `h`).\n*   **Poetic License:** In difficult lines, poets sometimes take liberties, such as lengthening a normally short vowel (`metri gratia`).\n\n**Step-by-Step Scansion:**\n\n1.  **Foot 1: `verum u-`**\n    *   `vē-`: The `e` is followed by two consonants (`r` and `m`), so it is long by position (—).\n    *   `-rum`: The `u` is naturally short (u). The final `-m` elides with the following `u-`.\n    *   `u-`: The first vowel of `ubi` is naturally short (u).\n    *   Result: `— u u`. This is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n2.  **Foot 2: `-bi equi`**\n    *   This part of the line is famously difficult and requires assuming a **poetic license**. The `e` in `equi` is normally short, which would not create a valid foot. To solve the meter, we assume the poet lengthened the `e` to `ē` (*metri gratia*).\n    *   The `-i` of `ubi` elides with the `e-` of `equi`.\n    *   The foot becomes `ēquī`. The lengthened `ē` is long (—), and the `ī` in the genitive `equī` is long by nature (—).\n    *   Result: `— —`. This is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n3.  **Foot 3: `atque homin-`**\n    *   The `e` in `atque` elides with the `o` in `hominis`.\n    *   `at-`: The `a` is followed by two consonants (`t` and `qu`), making it long by position (—).\n    *   `hom-`: The `o` is followed by two consonants (`m` and `n`), making it long by position (—).\n    *   Result: `— —`. This is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n4.  **Foot 4: `is cāsū`**\n    *   `-is`: This is the final syllable of `hominis`. Its `i` is short by nature, but it is followed by the `c` of `cāsū`, making it long by position (—).\n    *   `cā-`: The first syllable of `cāsū` is long by nature (—).\n    *   Result: `— —`. This is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n5.  **Foot 5: `convenit i-`**\n    *   This foot begins with the `-ū` leftover from `cāsū`, but that syllable belongs to the previous spondee. The foot begins with `convenit`.\n    *   `con-`: Long by position (before `nv`). (—).\n    *   `ve-`: The `e` in `convĕnit` (present tense) is short (u).\n    *   `-nit i-`: The final `-it` of `convenit` has a short `i`, which elides with the initial `i` of `imago`. The resulting syllable (`nĭ-`) is short (u).\n    *   Result: `— u u`. This is a **Dactyl (D)**, as is typical for the fifth foot.\n\n6.  **Foot 6: `-mago`**\n    *   After the elision, the line ends with the last two syllables of `imago`.\n    *   `mā-`: Long by nature (—).\n    *   `-gō`: Long by nature (—).\n    *   Result: `— —`. This is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n**Final Scansion:**\nThe pattern for the line is Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
