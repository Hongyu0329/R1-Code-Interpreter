    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  We are given a sequence of functions defined recursively:\n    *   `F₀(x) = x`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n2.  The goal is to evaluate the definite integral `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from `x=0` to `x=1`.\n\n3.  Finally, we need to calculate `10000 * V` and find the closest integer to this value.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Integrand Form**: The integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is a standard form. If we let `f(x) = F₃(x)`, the integrand is `f'(x)/f(x)`. The integral of this form is `ln|f(x)|`.\n2.  **Definite Integral**: We are evaluating a definite integral from 0 to 1. The result will be a constant value, V.\n3.  **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The integral will be evaluated as `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n4.  **Domain and Sign**: We must check if `F₃(x)` is positive on the interval [0, 1] to determine if the absolute value signs `|...|` can be removed.\n5.  **Numerical Calculation**: The final steps require a calculator to find the value of `sin(1)` (in radians), exponentials, and logarithms. High precision should be maintained throughout the calculation before the final rounding.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the integral's structure.**\nThe integral to evaluate is `V = ∫ (from 0 to 1) [F₃'(x)/F₃(x)] dx`.\nThis is in the form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`, where `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\nThe antiderivative of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.**\nUsing the antiderivative, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` (from 0 to 1)\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\nThis can be rewritten using the properties of logarithms as:\n`V = ln(|F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)|)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the value of F₃(x) at the lower limit, x = 0.**\n*   `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the value of F₃(x) at the upper limit, x = 1.**\n*   `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)` (Note: '1' is in radians)\n*   `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the sign of F₃(x) on the interval [0, 1].**\n*   For `x` in `[0, 1]`, `x` is in radians. `0 <= x <= 1`.\n*   `sin(x)` is non-negative on this interval (`0 <= sin(x) <= sin(1)`).\n*   `e^(sin(x))` is therefore greater than or equal to `e⁰ = 1`.\n*   `1 + e^(sin(x))` is greater than or equal to `1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is therefore greater than or equal to `ln(2)`.\nSince `ln(2)` is positive, `F₃(x)` is positive for all `x` in `[0, 1]`. This means we can safely remove the absolute value signs.\n`V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the expressions for F₃(1) and F₃(0) to find V.**\n`V = ln [ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / (ln(2)) ]`\n\n**Step 7: Perform the numerical calculation.**\nWe use a calculator (in radian mode) for the numerical values.\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.84147098) ≈ 2.31977755`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.31977755`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.31977755) ≈ 1.19985220`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718`\n*   The ratio `F₃(1) / F₃(0) ≈ 1.19985220 / 0.69314718 ≈ 1.73103280`\n*   `V = ln(1.73103280) ≈ 0.548726`\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the final value and find the closest integer.**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548726 = 5487.26`\n*   The closest integer to `5487.26` is `5487`."
