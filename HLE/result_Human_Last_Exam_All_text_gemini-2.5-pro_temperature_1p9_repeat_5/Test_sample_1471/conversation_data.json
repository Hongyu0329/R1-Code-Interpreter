    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the equation to find the solution.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Equation:** The problem is a mathematical equation involving division and subtraction: ` निव/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=? `. To solve it, we must first convert the numbers from their respective ancient scripts into modern numerals.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Denominator (`𒌋𒌋𒌋`):**\n    *   The symbol `𒌋` is a character from the Tifinagh alphabet, which is used by the Tuareg people in North Africa.\n    *   In the Tuareg numeral system, `𒌋` represents the number 1.\n    *   Therefore, the sequence `𒌋𒌋𒌋` represents the number 111.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Subtrahend (`𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹`):**\n    *   This term is composed of symbols from two different ancient scripts.\n    *   The first part, `𒌋𒌋`, is again from Tifinagh and represents the number 11.\n    *   The second part, `𒁹𒁹𒁹`, uses the Cuneiform script of ancient Mesopotamia. The symbol `𒁹` represents the number 1. Therefore, `𒁹𒁹𒁹` represents the number 3.\n    *   The most logical way to interpret this combination of scripts within a single term is by concatenating the numbers they represent.\n    *   So, `𒌋𒌋` (11) followed by `𒁹𒁹𒁹` (3) forms the number 113.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Numerator (`निव`):**\n    *   This is the most complex part of the puzzle. The characters `न`, `ि`, and `व` are from the Devanagari script (used for Hindi, Sanskrit, etc.) and spell the word \"niva\".\n    *   This word does not have a standard numerical meaning. We must consider a few possibilities.\n    *   One could use an esoteric system like Kaṭapayādi, but this leads to a complex decimal answer, which is unlikely for a puzzle of this type.\n    *   A more elegant solution arises if we assume the puzzle is designed to have a clean, integer result. For the expression `(निव / 111)` to be an integer, `निव` must be a multiple of 111.\n    *   Considering common single-digit multiples of 111 (e.g., 222, 333, ... , 999), the most plausible candidate is 999. The number 9 in Hindi is \"nau\" (नौ), which starts with the same \"n\" (न) sound as \"niva\". It's highly probable that `निव` is a cryptic or corrupted representation of 999, chosen to make the math work out neatly.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Now, substitute the modern numbers back into the equation:\n        `999 / 111 - 113`\n    *   Following the standard order of operations (division before subtraction):\n        *   First, calculate the division: `999 / 111 = 9`.\n        *   Then, perform the subtraction: `9 - 113 = -104`.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Script Identification:** The problem requires identifying characters from three distinct writing systems: Devanagari, Tifinagh, and Cuneiform.\n*   **Mixed Scripts:** One must correctly interpret the term `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹`, which mixes two scripts, inferring that concatenation is the intended method of combination.\n*   **Logical Inference:** The key to solving the puzzle is making a logical leap for the term `निव`. Instead of a literal translation, one must infer its value based on the structure of the problem, assuming an elegant, integer-based solution was intended by the puzzle's creator.\n*   **Order of Operations:** The calculation must follow the correct mathematical order of operations (divide first, then subtract).\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n\nThe equation translates to: `999 / 111 - 113`\nStep 1: `999 / 111 = 9`\nStep 2: `9 - 113 = -104`\n\n<<<-104>>>"
