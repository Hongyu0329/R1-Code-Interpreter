    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Type of Differential Equation**\n\nThe given initial value problem is:\n$$\nx'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t), \\quad x(0) = -8\n$$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation because it can be written in the form $\\frac{dx}{dt} = g(t)h(x)$, where $g(t) = t-1$ and $h(x) = x^2$.\n\n**2. Separate the Variables**\n\nTo solve this, we move all terms involving $x$ to one side with $dx$ and all terms involving $t$ to the other side with $dt$.\n\n*   **Careful point:** We will be dividing by $x^2$. We should first consider if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The equation becomes $0 = (t-1)(0)^2$, which is true. So, $x(t)=0$ is an equilibrium solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the particular solution we are looking for is not the zero solution, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n**3. Integrate Both Sides**\n\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n*   **Integrate the left side (with respect to x):**\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}\n    $$\n    *   **Careful point:** A common mistake is to integrate $1/x^2$ as a logarithm. Remember the power rule for integration: $\\int x^n dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$ for $n \\neq -1$.\n\n*   **Integrate the right side (with respect to t):**\n    $$\n    \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t\n    $$\n\nCombining these results, we get the general solution, including a constant of integration $C$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n\n**4. Use the Initial Condition to Find C**\n\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to solve for $C$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\nC = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**5. Find the Particular Solution**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\nTo find $x(t)$, we can first solve for $\\frac{1}{x}$ by multiplying by $-1$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x} = - \\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nThen, we take the reciprocal to find $x(t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\n\n**6. Find the Value of x(1)**\n\nFinally, we need to find the value of $x$ when $t=1$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution.\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{(1)^2}{2} + (1) - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\nSimplify the denominator:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\nFind a common denominator for the fractions in the denominator:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
