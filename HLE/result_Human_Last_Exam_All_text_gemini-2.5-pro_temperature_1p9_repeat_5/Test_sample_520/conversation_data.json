    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question focuses on a specific individual, a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault.\n2.  **Identify the Time and Place:** The setting is the United Kingdom during World War II.\n3.  **Identify the Key Event:** British counterintelligence (MI5) incorrectly suspected Vernault of being a German spy.\n4.  **Identify the Reason for Suspicion:** The suspicion arose because he concealed his \"true profession\" from his interrogators.\n5.  **State the Goal:** The objective is to find out what this concealed \"true profession\" was.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Psychology of Interrogation:** During wartime, especially with the threat of invasion, security services like MI5 were on high alert. Any inconsistency, evasiveness, or concealment by a refugee would be a major red flag, naturally leading to a suspicion of espionage.\n*   **The Psychology of the Refugee:** A refugee arriving in a foreign country under stressful circumstances might have various reasons for not being fully truthful, not all of which are nefarious. Andre Vernault's reason was personal and based on his perception of the profession.\n*   **The Irony of the Situation:** The core of this historical anecdote lies in the dramatic difference between what the authorities suspected (a highly trained German spy) and what the person actually was. The actual profession needed to be something that a person might plausibly be embarrassed to admit to stern, military-style interrogators.\n*   **Historical Accuracy:** The answer must be based on historical records, specifically the declassified files of MI5 and historical accounts written by authors who have studied these files (like Ben Macintyre in his book \"Double Cross\").\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Initial Research:** A search of historical records regarding WWII counterintelligence and the MI5 \"Double-Cross System\" is necessary. The name \"Andre Vernault\" is the primary key for this search.\n2.  **Locating the Case File:** Historical accounts confirm that Andre Vernault was a real Belgian refugee who arrived in the UK in 1940. He was interrogated by the security service, MI5, at a reception center known as the \"London Reception Centre.\"\n3.  **Analyzing the Suspicion:** The MI5 officers noted that Vernault was evasive when asked about his past and his profession. Lying or hiding information was a classic sign of a trained agent trying to conceal their background or mission. They therefore suspected he was an enemy spy sent by the Abwehr (German military intelligence).\n4.  **Discovering the Truth:** After further interrogation and investigation, the truth was revealed. Vernault was not a spy. The profession he was trying to hide was not espionage but one he felt was absurd and frivolous. He was afraid the British authorities would laugh at him or not take him seriously if he confessed it.\n5.  **Identifying the Profession:** Historical records and books based on them reveal that Andre Vernault's true profession was that of a **lion tamer**. He and his family worked in a circus, and he was ashamed to admit to what he considered a silly and undignified job during a time of grave international crisis.\n\n<<<Lion tamer>>>"
