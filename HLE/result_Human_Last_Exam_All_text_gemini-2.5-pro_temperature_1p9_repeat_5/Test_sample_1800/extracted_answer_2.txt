The ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles depends on the specific application.

*   **For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction:** A higher ratio is generally required to maximize surface active sites. The optimal range is typically a Ni/Ce molar ratio between **0.1 and 0.5**.
*   **For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS):** A lower ratio, where Ni acts as a dopant, is ideal to enhance the redox properties of ceria without compromising stability. The optimal range is typically a Ni/Ce molar ratio between **0.05 and 0.15**.
