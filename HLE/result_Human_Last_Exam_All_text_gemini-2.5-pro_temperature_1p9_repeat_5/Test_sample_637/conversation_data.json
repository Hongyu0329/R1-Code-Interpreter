    "Answering this question requires designing a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system. The main steps are as follows:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Deadbeat Observer Requirement:**\n    A deadbeat observer is designed to make the observation error $e(k) = x(k) - \\hat{x}(k)$ converge to zero in the shortest possible number of time steps. The error dynamics are given by $e(k+1) = (A-LC)e(k)$. For the error to become identically zero after a finite number of steps, say $\\nu$, for any initial error $e(0)$, the condition is $(A-LC)^\\nu = 0$. This means the matrix $A-LC$ must be nilpotent, which implies all its eigenvalues must be zero. The shortest possible number of steps, $\\nu$, is the observability index of the system pair (A, C), provided the system is observable.\n\n2.  **Check System Observability:**\n    First, we must check if the system is observable. The observability matrix is $O = \\begin{bmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ CA^{n-1} \\end{bmatrix}$. The system is observable if the rank of $O$ is equal to the state dimension, $n=4$.\n    The system matrices are:\n    $A = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $C = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n    We compute the blocks of the observability matrix:\n    $C = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. Rank(C) = 2.\n    $CA = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\end{bmatrix}$ has rank 3.\n    $A^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 \\\\ -3 & 0 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 3 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 0 & -4 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    $CA^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 1 & -6 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    The observability matrix up to this point is $O_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 1 & -6 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    The rank of this $6 \\times 4$ matrix is 4. Thus, the system is observable. The observability index $\\nu_o$ is the smallest integer such that the rank is 4, which is $\\nu_o=3$.\n\n3.  **Pole Placement for the Observer:**\n    The shortest time for the error to converge to zero is $\\nu_o=3$ steps. This requires that the minimal polynomial of the error dynamics matrix $A-LC$ is $\\lambda^3$. This implies the characteristic polynomial of $A-LC$ must be $\\lambda^4$. The problem is to find the $4 \\times 2$ gain matrix $L$ that achieves this.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Problem:**\n    The calculation is simplified by transforming the output matrix $C$ into a more convenient form. Let $E = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. We can define a new output $y_{new}(k) = Ey(k)$, with the new output matrix $C_{new} = EC = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    We can design a gain $L_{new}$ for the system $(A, C_{new})$, such that $A-L_{new}C_{new}$ has the desired eigenvalues. The original gain $L$ is then recovered by $L = L_{new}E$.\n    Let $A'' = A - L_{new}C_{new}$.\n    $L_{new}C_{new} = \\begin{bmatrix} l'_{11} & l'_{12} \\\\ l'_{21} & l'_{22} \\\\ l'_{31} & l'_{32} \\\\ l'_{41} & l'_{42} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} l'_{11} & 0 & 0 & l'_{12} \\\\ l'_{21} & 0 & 0 & l'_{22} \\\\ l'_{31} & 0 & 0 & l'_{32} \\\\ l'_{41} & 0 & 0 & l'_{42} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    $A'' = \\begin{bmatrix} -1-l'_{11} & 0 & 0 & 1-l'_{12} \\\\ 1-l'_{21} & 0 & 0 & 2-l'_{22} \\\\ -l'_{31} & 1 & 0 & -1-l'_{32} \\\\ -1-l'_{41} & 0 & 1 & -1-l'_{42} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n5.  **Set Constraints on the Gain Matrix:**\n    We require the minimal polynomial of $A''$ to be $\\lambda^3$. This means the Jordan form of $A''$ consists of one $3 \\times 3$ Jordan block and one $1 \\times 1$ Jordan block, both for the eigenvalue 0. This implies that the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 must be 2, i.e., $\\dim(\\ker(A''))=2$.\n    The characteristic polynomial of $A''$ is $\\det(\\lambda I - A'') = \\lambda^4$. Setting the coefficients of $\\lambda^0, \\lambda^1, \\lambda^2, \\lambda^3$ to zero provides 4 equations.\n    The condition $\\dim(\\ker(A''))=2$ for the matrix structure of $A''$ requires the submatrix formed by rows 1, 2 and columns 1, 4 to be zero.\n    This gives:\n    $-1-l'_{11}=0 \\implies l'_{11}=-1$\n    $1-l'_{12}=0 \\implies l'_{12}=1$\n    $1-l'_{21}=0 \\implies l'_{21}=1$\n    $2-l'_{22}=0 \\implies l'_{22}=2$\n    The characteristic polynomial equations then yield the remaining determinate values:\n    $l'_{32}=-1$\n    $l'_{42}=-1$\n    With these gains, the characteristic polynomial becomes $\\lambda^4$ and the minimal polynomial becomes $\\lambda^3$, independent of the values of $l'_{31}$ and $l'_{41}$.\n\n6.  **Resolve the Non-uniqueness:**\n    The gains $l'_{31}$ and $l'_{41}$ are not determined by the deadbeat pole placement requirement. This is common in multi-variable control design. A standard method to obtain a unique solution is to select the gain matrix with the minimum Frobenius norm. This means we want to minimize $\\|L\\|^2_F = \\sum_{i,j} l_{ij}^2$. The expression for $L$ in terms of $L_{new}$ is $L = L_{new}E$.\n    $l_{31} = l'_{31} - l'_{32} = l'_{31} + 1$\n    $l_{41} = l'_{41} - l'_{42} = l'_{41} + 1$\n    To minimize the sum of squares of the elements of L, the terms $(l'_{31}+1)^2$ and $(l'_{41}+1)^2$ must be minimized. This is achieved by setting them to zero:\n    $l'_{31} + 1 = 0 \\implies l'_{31} = -1$\n    $l'_{41} + 1 = 0 \\implies l'_{41} = -1$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Gain Matrix:**\n    Now all elements of $L_{new}$ are determined:\n    $L_{new} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    Finally, we compute the observer gain $L$ for the original system:\n    $L = L_{new}E = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1-1 & 1 \\\\ 1-2 & 2 \\\\ -1+1 & -1 \\\\ -1+1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThis gain matrix $L$ will place all the eigenvalues of $A-LC$ at zero and make the error dynamics matrix $A-LC$ nilpotent with an index of 3, ensuring the observation error becomes zero in exactly 3 steps, which is the shortest possible time.\n\n<<<\n[[ -2, 1 ],[ -1, 2 ],[ 0, -1 ],[ 0, -1 ]]\n>>>"
