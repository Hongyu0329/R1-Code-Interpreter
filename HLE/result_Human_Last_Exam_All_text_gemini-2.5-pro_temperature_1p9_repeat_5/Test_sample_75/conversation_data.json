    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Scope of the Conflict:** The \"Second Great War\" in StarCraft lore refers to the sector-wide conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). The central antagonist of this war is the fallen Xel'naga, Amon, and his various forces.\n\n2.  **Identify the Start Date:** According to the official StarCraft timeline, the Second Great War begins in the year **2504**. The inciting incident is the renewed large-scale Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, starting with the attack on the planet Mar Sara, which marks the beginning of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign.\n\n3.  **Identify the End Date:** The war concludes with the final defeat of Amon. This occurs during the epilogue of *Legacy of the Void*, titled *Into the Void*, where the unified forces of the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss confront and destroy Amon's essence. These events take place in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:**\n    *   The war starts in the year 2504.\n    *   The war ends in the year 2506.\n    *   This means the conflict was active across three distinct calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Elapsed Time:**\n    *   The war was active for a portion of the year 2504 (covering the *Wings of Liberty* campaign).\n    *   The war continued through the entirety of the year 2505. Canonically, the events of *Heart of the Swarm*, which ends with the death of Arcturus Mengsk, span from late 2504 into 2505. The state of war against Amon's influence and forces persisted throughout this year.\n    *   The war concluded after a portion of the year 2506 had passed (covering the *Legacy of the Void* campaign and its epilogue).\n\n    Therefore, the total duration is the sum of these periods:\n    (A fraction of year 2504) + (All of year 2505) + (A fraction of year 2506)\n\n    This sums to a total duration that is greater than two full years. For example, if the war started in March 2504 and ended in June 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 3 months.\n\n6.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:** The question asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   Since the total elapsed time is confirmed to be more than 2 full years (but less than 3 full years), we can represent this as `2.x` years, where `x` is some positive value.\n    *   When we round any number greater than 2.0 up to the nearest whole number, the result is 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **War vs. Campaigns:** The duration of a war is the total time from the initial hostilities to the final cessation, not just the sum of the time spent on specific military campaigns. The periods between the *StarCraft II* games were not peaceful, as Amon's forces (like Moebius Corps and the Tal'darim) were still active threats.\n*   **Vague Timelines:** Official lore often provides only the year, not specific months or dates, for major events. The logical conclusion must be drawn from the fact that the conflict spans three separate calendar years.\n*   **\"Rounded Up\" Keyword:** This instruction is critical. It implies the exact duration is not a perfect integer. A duration that spans across three calendar years is almost certain to be a non-integer value greater than two.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is calculated by determining the war spanned parts of three calendar years, making its duration over two full years, which rounds up to three.\n\n<<<3>>>"
