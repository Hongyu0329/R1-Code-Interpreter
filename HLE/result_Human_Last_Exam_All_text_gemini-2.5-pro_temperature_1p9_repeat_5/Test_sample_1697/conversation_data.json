    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material and Reagents**\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   It consists of a benzene ring.\n    *   At position 1, there is an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group: -CON(C₂H₅)₂.\n    *   At position 3, there is a dimethylamino group: -N(CH₃)₂.\n*   **Reagents (First Step):** `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) and `TMEDA` (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) in `THF` solvent.\n*   **Reagent (Second Step):** `Methyl iodide` (CH₃I).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction (Lithiation)**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic example of **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. The combination of sec-BuLi (a very strong base) and TMEDA (a chelating agent for lithium) is used to selectively remove a proton (H⁺) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to a directing functional group on an aromatic ring, replacing it with lithium (Li⁺).\n*   **Identifying Directing Groups:** The starting molecule has two potential directing groups:\n    1.  The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group [-CON(Et)₂].\n    2.  The dimethylamino group [-N(Me)₂].\n*   **Determining the Site of Lithiation:**\n    *   The directing ability of a functional group depends on its capacity to coordinate with the lithium ion. The amide group (-CONR₂) is one of the most powerful directing groups for ortho-lithiation, significantly stronger than the amino group (-NR₂).\n    *   Therefore, the lithiation will primarily occur at a position ortho to the stronger directing group, the -CON(Et)₂ group located at C1.\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   We must also consider the effect of the second directing group, the -N(Me)₂ at C3.\n    *   The C2 position is *ortho* to both the amide at C1 and the amino group at C3.\n    *   The C6 position is *ortho* to the amide at C1 but *meta* to the amino group at C3.\n    *   When two directing groups are positioned meta to each other (at C1 and C3), lithiation is highly favored at the C2 position, which lies between them. This is because the lithium ion can be chelated by both the oxygen atom of the amide and the nitrogen atom of the amino group, forming a stable six-membered ring intermediate. This chelation makes the C2 proton the most acidic and kinetically favored for abstraction by sec-BuLi.\n*   **Intermediate Product:** The deprotonation occurs selectively at the C2 position, forming the aryllithium intermediate: **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction (Alkylation)**\n*   **Reaction Type:** The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a strong nucleophile (the C2 carbon has carbanionic character). The second reagent, methyl iodide (CH₃I), is an electrophile. The reaction is a nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic C2-Li attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I. The iodide ion (I⁻) acts as a leaving group.\n*   **Outcome:** The lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Product**\n*   By combining the results of the two steps, we start with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide and add a methyl group at the C2 position.\n*   The final product's structure has the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at C1, a methyl group at C2, and a dimethylamino group at C3.\n*   The name of this compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Reaction Recognition:** Correctly identify the reaction as a two-step Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\n2.  **Hierarchy of Directing Groups:** Recognize that the -CONR₂ group is a stronger directing group than the -NR₂ group.\n3.  **Cooperative Directing Effect:** Understand that when two directing groups are meta (at C1 and C3), they cooperatively direct the metalation to the C2 position between them due to chelation.\n4.  **Nucleophile-Electrophile Reaction:** Identify the aryllithium intermediate as a nucleophile and methyl iodide as the electrophile for the second step.\n5.  **Final Structure:** Accurately place the incoming methyl group onto the lithiated position (C2) to determine the final product structure.\n\nThe final compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
