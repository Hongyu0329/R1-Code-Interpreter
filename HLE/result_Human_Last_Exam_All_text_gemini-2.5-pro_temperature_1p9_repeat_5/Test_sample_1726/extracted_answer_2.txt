1.  **True.** Relativity of simultaneity still holds. The time coordinate in one frame depends on both the time and space coordinates of the other frame.
2.  **True.** Relativity of lengths still holds, but it manifests as length expansion (elongation) rather than contraction.
3.  **True.** Relativity of time still holds, but it manifests as time contraction (moving clocks run faster) rather than time dilation.
4.  **False.** The speed of light is not invariant. There is no real, non-zero invariant speed in this theory.
5.  **True.** The rule for adding velocities is non-Newtonian.
6.  The formula for length expansion is $L = L_0 \sqrt{1+v^2}$ (where $L_0$ is the proper length, $L$ is the measured length, and $v$ is the relative speed).
7.  The formula for time contraction is $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1+v^2}}$ (where $\Delta t_0$ is the proper time interval and $\Delta t$ is the measured time interval).
8.  The formula for the addition of speeds is $u'_{x} = \frac{u_{x}-v}{1+vu_{x}}$ (where $u_x$ is the velocity in frame S, $u'_x$ is the velocity in frame S', and $v$ is the relative velocity of the frames).
