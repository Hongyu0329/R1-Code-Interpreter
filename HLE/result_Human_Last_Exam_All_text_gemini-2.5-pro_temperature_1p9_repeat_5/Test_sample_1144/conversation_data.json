    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum of an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Goal and Given Information**\n*   **Goal:** To find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$, where $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in the electron's momentum and $p$ is the momentum of the electron.\n*   **Given:**\n    *   The particle is an electron.\n    *   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n    *   The uncertainty in the electron's position, $\\Delta x$, is 10 pm.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Formula for Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n*   The relationship between the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) is given by **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**.\n*   The principle states: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   For the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$.\n*   Rearranging for $\\Delta p$, we get: $\\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Formula for the Momentum ($p$) in the First Bohr Orbit**\n*   According to the **Bohr model**, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in a specific orbit is quantized.\n*   The formula is: $L = mvr = n \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n*   Momentum is defined as $p = mv$. Substituting this into the angular momentum equation gives: $pr = n \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$.\n*   For the first Bohr orbit, n=1, so the equation becomes: $p_1 r_1 = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$.\n*   Rearranging for the momentum ($p_1$), we get: $p_1 = \\frac{h}{2\\pi r_1}$.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Ratio and Simplify**\n*   Now we can create the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1}$ using the expressions from Step 2 and Step 3.\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi r_1}\\right)}$\n*   To simplify this complex fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x} \\times \\frac{2\\pi r_1}{h}$\n*   We can cancel common terms ($h$, $2\\pi$) from the numerator and denominator:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   **Careful Point:** This simplification is very useful as it eliminates the need for Planck's constant ($h$) and pi ($\\pi$) in the final calculation, reducing the chance of error.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Necessary Values and Perform the Final Calculation**\n*   From the problem statement, we have the uncertainty in position:\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$\n*   We need the radius of the first Bohr orbit ($r_1$). This is a well-known physical constant called the **Bohr radius ($a_0$)**.\n    $r_1 = a_0 = 52.9 \\text{ pm}$\n*   **Careful Point:** Since both values are in the same units (picometers, pm), we do not need to convert them to meters. The units will cancel out in the ratio.\n*   Now, substitute these values into our simplified formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{52.9 \\text{ pm}}{2 \\times 10 \\text{ pm}}$\n*   Perform the calculation:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{52.9}{20} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of the electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit is 2.645.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
