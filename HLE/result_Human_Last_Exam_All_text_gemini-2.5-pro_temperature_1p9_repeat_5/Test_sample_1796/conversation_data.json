    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the sentence and the target word.**\nThe sentence is: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\nThe question asks for the part of speech of the first word, which is \"Fat\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the role of the word \"Fat\" in the sentence.**\nThe word \"Fat\" is placed directly before the word \"people\". The word \"people\" is a noun. In English grammar, a word that is placed before a noun to describe or modify it is typically an adjective.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the phrase \"Fat people\".**\nThis phrase functions as a unit. \"Fat\" answers the question \"What kind of people?\". For example, just like in \"tall people\" or \"smart people\", the first word is an adjective describing the noun \"people\". Therefore, \"Fat\" is functioning as an adjective here.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the rest of the sentence.**\nThe rest of the sentence, \"eat accumulates,\" is grammatically incorrect. This might be confusing, but it does not change the grammatical function of the word \"Fat\" within the initial phrase \"Fat people\". The part of speech is determined by the word's function in relation to the words immediately around it.\n\n**Step 5: Review the answer choices.**\n*   A. Verb: \"Fat\" is not an action in this context. Incorrect.\n*   B. Noun: While \"fat\" can be a noun (e.g., \"That food contains a lot of fat\"), in this sentence it is describing \"people\", not acting as a standalone thing. Incorrect.\n*   C. Adjective: This fits perfectly. \"Fat\" describes the noun \"people\". Correct.\n*   D. Adverb: An adverb modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. \"Fat\" is not doing that here. Incorrect.\n*   E. Conjunction: \"Fat\" is not connecting words or clauses. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on its position before the noun \"people\" and its function as a descriptive word, \"Fat\" is an adjective.\n\n<<<C>>>"
