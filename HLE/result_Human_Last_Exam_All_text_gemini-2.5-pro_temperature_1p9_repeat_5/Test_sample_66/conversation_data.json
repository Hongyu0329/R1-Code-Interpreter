    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the Tongan flag and its matrix representation.\n\n1.  **The Flag's Design**: The flag of Tonga consists of a red field (background). In the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle. Inside this white rectangle, there is a red \"couped cross\", which is a cross that does not extend to the edges of the white rectangle.\n\n2.  **The Matrix Model**: We represent an image of the flag as an `m x n` matrix, `M`.\n    *   Pixels that are red are assigned a numerical value `a`.\n    *   Pixels that are white are assigned a numerical value `b`.\n    *   The question asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which implies we can choose the values of `a` and `b`, as well as the dimensions of the flag and its components, to maximize this rank. Let's assume generic values, for instance `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`, to avoid trivial cases where the rank collapses (e.g., if `a=b`, the matrix has all identical entries and its rank is 1).\n\n3.  **Matrix Structure**: The matrix `M` can be described as follows:\n    *   Let the canton occupy the top-left `m_c x n_c` submatrix.\n    *   The rest of the matrix, i.e., all entries `M(i, j)` where `i > m_c` or `j > n_c`, corresponds to the main red field and will have the value `a`.\n    *   The `m_c x n_c` submatrix for the canton consists of a white background (value `b`) with a red cross (value `a`). The red cross is formed by a horizontal band of rows and a vertical band of columns within the canton.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the columns of the matrix M.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its columns. Let's analyze the column vectors of `M`.\n\n1.  **Columns outside the canton**: Consider any column `j` where `j > n_c`. Every pixel in this column belongs to the red field. Therefore, every entry in this column vector is `a`. All such columns are identical: `[a, a, ..., a]^T`.\n\n2.  **Columns inside the canton**: Consider a column `j` where `j ≤ n_c`.\n    *   The entries from row `m_c + 1` to `m` are part of the main red field, so they are all `a`.\n    *   For the entries from row `1` to `m_c` (the part of the column within the canton), the value depends on whether the pixel is part of the red cross or the white background.\n    *   **Case A: The column intersects the vertical bar of the cross.** If column `j` corresponds to the vertical bar of the red cross, all pixels `M(i, j)` for `i ≤ m_c` are red, hence have the value `a`. Combining with the fact that entries for `i > m_c` are also `a`, this entire column vector is `[a, a, ..., a]^T`.\n    *   **Case B: The column does not intersect the vertical bar of the cross.** If column `j` corresponds to a white part of the canton, its entries from `i = 1` to `m_c` are `a` where they cross the horizontal bar of the red cross, and `b` otherwise. The entries for `i > m_c` are all `a`.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the distinct types of columns.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that every column of the matrix `M` must be one of only two types:\n\n*   **Type 1 (let's call it `c_R`)**: A vector where all entries are `a`. This applies to all columns `j > n_c` and all columns `j ≤ n_c` that are part of the vertical bar of the cross.\n*   **Type 2 (let's call it `c_W`)**: A vector corresponding to a column `j ≤ n_c` that is not part of the vertical bar of the cross. This vector has `a`s for rows in the main field (`i > m_c`) and rows in the horizontal cross bar, and `b`s for rows in the white background of the canton. Critically, all columns of this type are identical to each other.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the dimension of the column space (the rank).\n\nThe column space of `M` is the vector space spanned by all its column vectors. Since every column is either of type `c_R` or type `c_W`, the column space is `span(c_R, c_W)`.\n\nThe dimension of this space can be at most 2. To find the *maximal possible* rank, we need to check if a rank of 2 is achievable.\n\nThe rank will be exactly 2 if the two vectors, `c_R` and `c_W`, are linearly independent.\n*   `c_R` is a constant vector: `[a, a, ..., a]^T`.\n*   `c_W` is a vector containing both `a`s and `b`s.\n\nFor `c_W` to be linearly dependent on `c_R`, `c_W` must be a scalar multiple of `c_R`. Since `c_R` is a constant vector, `c_W` would also have to be a constant vector. This would only be possible if all entries of `c_W` are the same, which implies `a = b`.\n\nHowever, the problem implies there are two different colors, so we assume `a ≠ b`. Also, for the maximal rank, we can choose `a` and `b` to be different. For example, let `a=1` and `b=2`.\n*   In this case, `c_R` would be `[1, 1, ..., 1]^T`.\n*   `c_W` would be a vector containing `1`s and `2`s.\n\nThese two vectors are linearly independent. `c_W` is not a multiple of `c_R` because its entries are not all identical.\n\nFurthermore, the design of the Tongan flag guarantees that both types of columns exist:\n*   Because the cross is \"couped,\" its vertical bar does not extend to the edges of the white canton. This means there are columns within the canton that are not part of the vertical bar, giving us columns of type `c_W`.\n*   The vertical bar of the cross does exist, which provides columns of type `c_R` (within the canton). Also, the main field provides columns of type `c_R`.\n\nTherefore, the column space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors. This means the dimension of the column space is 2.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe structure of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga limits its columns to be of only two distinct types. By choosing the values `a` and `b` such that `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`, these two types of columns are guaranteed to be linearly independent. Therefore, the maximal possible rank of the matrix is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
