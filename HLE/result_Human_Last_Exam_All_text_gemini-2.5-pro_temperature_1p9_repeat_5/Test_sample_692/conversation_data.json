    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the earliest known recorded date by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for three key things:\n1.  **An earliest known date:** This refers to a specific, identifiable calendrical notation.\n2.  **Recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization:** The origin must be one of the indigenous cultures of the Americas before 1492.\n3.  **In an aboriginal writing system:** The date must be written in a native script (like hieroglyphs), not just inferred from astronomical alignments or other non-written archaeological evidence.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Civilizations and Writing Systems\nThe primary candidates for the earliest writing and calendrical systems in Mesoamerica (where the earliest dates are found) are the Olmec, the Zapotec, and the Maya. We need to examine the evidence from each.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Contenders for the \"Earliest Date\"\n\nThere is a crucial distinction between the earliest *writing* and the earliest *recorded date*.\n*   **Earliest Writing:** The **Cascajal Block**, attributed to the Olmec civilization and dated archaeologically to around 900 BCE, is considered the earliest example of writing in the Americas. However, the script is undeciphered, and it does not contain any recognizable or confirmed calendrical date. Therefore, it is not the answer to this question.\n\nNow we must look for the earliest confirmed *calendrical* inscription. There are two types of dates to consider: dates from the 260-day ritual calendar and dates from the absolute \"Long Count\" calendar. The question does not specify which type, so the earliest of either would be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Contender 1: The San Andrés Cylinder Seal (Olmec)**\n    *   **Description:** A small ceramic seal found in an Olmec context in Tabasco, Mexico.\n    *   **Dating:** Radiocarbon dating of associated materials places it around **650 BCE**.\n    *   **The Date:** It contains glyphs that some prominent archaeologists interpret as representing the day **3 Ajaw** in the 260-day ritual calendar.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This interpretation, while compelling, is not universally accepted by all scholars in the field.\n\n*   **Contender 2: Monument 3 at San José Mogote (Zapotec)**\n    *   **Description:** A carved stone slab, or *danzante*, found at the Zapotec center of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. It depicts a slain captive.\n    *   **Dating:** The monument is archaeologically dated to between **600 BCE and 500 BCE**.\n    *   **The Date:** Carved between the figure's legs is a clear glyph that is widely interpreted as the day-name **\"1 Earthquake\"** (or \"1 Motion\") in the 260-day calendar.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most widely accepted and scientifically supported candidate for the earliest recorded date. The glyph is clearly a calendrical name, and its context and dating are well-established.\n\n*   **Contender 3: The earliest Long Count Dates**\n    The Long Count calendar provides an absolute date by counting days from a fixed start point (in 3114 BCE).\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** This monument from Chiapas, Mexico, was long held as the earliest *complete* Long Count date. It records a date corresponding to **December 10, 36 BCE**.\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** An Epi-Olmec monument from Veracruz, Mexico, that records a date corresponding to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n    *   **San Bartolo Murals:** Painted murals discovered in Guatemala show glyphic fragments from a much earlier period, dated to **c. 300-200 BCE**. While a complete Long Count date is not preserved, legible fragments show the use of Long Count notation (specifically a glyph for the \"7th B'ak'tun,\" a period from 354 BCE to 41 CE), confirming that Long Count dates were being written down centuries before the Chiapa de Corzo stela.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While the San Bartolo fragments are the earliest evidence of the *Long Count system* being written, the Zapotec date from San José Mogote is still several centuries older.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion of the Analysis\nComparing the contenders, the date from Zapotec Monument 3 at San José Mogote is the strongest answer.\n*   It is significantly older (c. 600 BCE) than any known Long Count date.\n*   It is a clearly identifiable calendrical glyph (\"1 Earthquake\").\n*   Its interpretation is more widely accepted in the academic community than the slightly older but more contentious Olmec glyph from the San Andrés seal.\n\nTherefore, the Zapotec record of the day \"1 Earthquake\" stands as the earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian aboriginal writing system.\n\n***\n\nThe earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is the day-name **\"1 Earthquake\"**. It was carved in Zapotec glyphs on **Monument 3 at the site of San José Mogote**, in what is now Oaxaca, Mexico. The monument is archaeologically dated to approximately **600 BCE**.\n\n<<<1 Earthquake>>>"
