    "There is one Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 receptor subunit, encoded by the GABRR1 gene, consists of 479 amino acids. The protein has a structure that includes four transmembrane (TM) domains. Based on the UniProt entry for this protein (accession number P24046) and associated database information, the transmembrane domains are located at the following positions:\n\n*   **TM1:** 282-305\n*   **TM2:** 309-331\n*   **TM3:** 343-365\n*   **TM4:** 458-479\n\nThe linker region between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TM3-TM4 linker) is the sequence of amino acids from position 366 to 457. The sequence for this linker is:\n\n`LTTVQERKEQKLREKLPCTSGLPPPRTAMLDGNYSDGEVNDLDNYMPENGEKPDRMMVQLTLASERSSPQRKSQRSSYVSMRIDTHAIDKYSRIIFP`\n\nBy analyzing this specific amino acid sequence, a single cysteine residue (C) is found at position 380 of the full-length protein.\n\n<<<1>>>"
