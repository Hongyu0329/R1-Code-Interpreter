    "A central concept in this problem is the \"clique.\" A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. This means the subgraph induced by a clique is a complete graph. The size of a clique is simply the number of vertices it contains.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of *different clique sizes* that can exist in a single graph with 128 vertices. Let's analyze the set of possible clique sizes for any given graph G.\n\nIf a graph G has a clique of a certain size *k*, this clique forms a complete subgraph of size *k* (denoted as K_k). Any subset of the *k* vertices within this clique will also be fully connected to each other. Consequently, for any integer *j* between 1 and *k*, we can select a subset of *j* vertices from the original clique, and this subset will form a clique of size *j*.\n\nThis leads to a crucial conclusion: if the largest clique in a graph G has a size of ω(G) (known as the clique number), then the set of all possible clique sizes that appear in G is {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}. The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to the size of the largest clique, ω(G).\n\nThe problem then simplifies to finding the maximum possible clique number, ω(G), for any graph G with n = 128 vertices. By definition, a clique is a subset of the graph's vertices. Therefore, the size of a clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph with 128 vertices, the maximum possible size for a clique is 128.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved by the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted K_128. In K_128, all 128 vertices are connected to each other. We can select any subset of these vertices, from size 1 up to 128, and it will form a clique. Therefore, K_128 contains induced subgraphs that are cliques of every possible size from 1 to 128. This gives a total of 128 different clique sizes.\n\nIt's important to distinguish this from the related, but different, question of the number of *maximal* clique sizes. A maximal clique is one that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. A graph can have maximal cliques of different sizes, and the set of these sizes is not necessarily consecutive. However, as the problem specifies \"clique sizes\" without the \"maximal\" qualifier, the straightforward interpretation is correct.\n\n<<<128>>>"
