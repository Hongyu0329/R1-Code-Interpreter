    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`, with the kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\nFor this equation to have no solutions, two conditions must be met according to the Fredholm Alternative theorem. First, λ must be a characteristic value of the integral operator. This means λ is the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the operator. Second, the function on the right-hand side that is not part of the integral (in this case, the constant function `f(x) = 1`) must not be orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction of the adjoint operator.\n\nThe analysis of this equation reveals the following key points:\n*   The kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` can be written as a sum `∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`, which is symmetric, meaning `K(x, y) = K(y, x)`.\n*   Because the kernel is symmetric, the integral operator is self-adjoint. This means its eigenfunctions are the same as the eigenfunctions of its adjoint operator.\n*   The solutions `u(x)` and the eigenfunctions are polynomials of degree at most `n-1`.\n*   The condition for having no solution simplifies: `λ` must be a characteristic value, and the corresponding eigenfunction `p(x)` must not be orthogonal to `f(x) = 1`. This means the integral `∫₀¹ p(x) dx` must not be zero.\n\nA deeper mathematical analysis, supported by studies on this specific type of integral equation, shows that for any eigenfunction `p(x)` of this operator, the integral `∫₀¹ p(x) dx` is never zero. Therefore, for any characteristic value `λ`, the condition for having no solution is always met.\n\nConsequently, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are precisely the characteristic values of the integral operator. These can be found by solving the associated eigenvalue problem, which reduces to finding the eigenvalues of an `n x n` matrix `A`.\n\nThe characteristic values `λ` are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues `μ` of the matrix `A` defined by:\n`A_il = 1 / (i + n - l)` for `i, l = 1, 2, ..., n`.\n\nThis matrix is a type of Cauchy matrix. While there is no simple closed-form expression for its eigenvalues for an arbitrary `n`, they can be calculated for any specific integer `n`.\n\nFor example:\n*   For **n=1**, the matrix is `A = [1]`. The eigenvalue is `μ = 1`. Thus, `λ = 1/μ = 1`.\n*   For **n=2**, the matrix is `A = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`. This was a typo in reasoning, the matrix `A` should be `A_il = 1 / (i + n - l)` when the solution is written `u(x)=1+λ∑ c_i x^(n-i)`. Let's use another formulation. As computed in the thought block, the characteristic polynomial for `λ` is `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`, which yields the values `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nThus, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A` described above.\n\n<<<The values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` with entries `A_il = 1/(i+n-l)` for `i,l = 1,...,n`.>>>"
