No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They are two distinct classes of biopolymers with different monomeric units, chemical composition, and backbone linkages. Polysaccharides are composed of monosaccharide (sugar) units linked by glycosidic bonds, while polynucleotides are composed of nucleotide units (each containing a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds.
