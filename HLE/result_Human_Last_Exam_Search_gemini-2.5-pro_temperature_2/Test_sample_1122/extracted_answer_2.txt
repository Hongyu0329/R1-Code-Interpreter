The provided amino acid sequence represents **Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (G6PD)** from *Homo sapiens* (humans).

This protein is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism. Its primary function is to produce NADPH, a molecule essential for protecting cells from oxidative damage and for processes like the biosynthesis of fatty acids and isoprenoids.

The UniProt accession number for human G6PD is **P11413**. Genetic variants of this enzyme can lead to a condition known as G6PD deficiency, which may cause neonatal jaundice and hemolytic anemia.
