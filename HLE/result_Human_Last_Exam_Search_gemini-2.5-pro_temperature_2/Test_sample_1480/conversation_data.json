    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system, also referred to as the firing strength, is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the membership degrees of the inputs in the antecedent part of a fuzzy rule. In the context of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, the process involves similar principles, where the uncertainties are represented with more complexity.\n\nThe firing strength of a rule, denoted as Φ̃_k(x'), is calculated by applying a t-norm operation to all the supreme membership values of the intersection of each input with its corresponding antecedent fuzzy set.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   **Φ_k(x′) = 0.7**: This represents the firing strength of the antecedent part of the k-th rule.\n*   **μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9**: This represents the membership degree of the output `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j`.\n\nTo determine the activation level of the consequent of the rule, a t-norm operation is applied to the antecedent's firing strength and the consequent's membership function. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation. Several types of t-norms can be used, with the most common being:\n\n*   **Minimum (Gödel) t-norm**: `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n*   **Product t-norm**: `T(a, b) = a * b`\n*   **Łukasiewicz t-norm**: `T(a, b) = max(0, a + b - 1)`\n\nApplying these t-norms to the given values yields the following results for the rule activation level:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm**:\n    min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n*   **Using the Product t-norm**:\n    0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\n*   **Using the Łukasiewicz t-norm**:\n    max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the most frequently used is the minimum operator. Therefore, the most common answer for the rule activation level would be 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
