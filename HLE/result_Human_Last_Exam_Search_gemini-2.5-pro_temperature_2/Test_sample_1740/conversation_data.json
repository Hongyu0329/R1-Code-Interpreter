    "To date, the let-7 family of microRNAs in humans consists of a group of closely related members, with most sources indicating between 10 and 12 identified members.\n\nSpecifically, in humans, there are 10 mature let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs). These include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202. These mature miRNAs are derived from 13 precursor genes. Some sources mention that the human let-7 family consists of 11 very closely related genes.\n\nThe discrepancy in the exact number can be attributed to the distinction between mature miRNAs and the genomic loci that encode them. For instance, some research points to 12 different genomic loci from which the let-7 family members originate. These genes are distributed across various chromosomes, with some being located individually and others grouped in clusters.\n\nDespite the minor variations in the reported numbers, there is a consensus on a core group of highly conserved let-7 family members that play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and cellular processes. The let-7 family was one of the first groups of miRNAs to be discovered and is known to be highly conserved across many species.\n\n<<<10-12>>>"
