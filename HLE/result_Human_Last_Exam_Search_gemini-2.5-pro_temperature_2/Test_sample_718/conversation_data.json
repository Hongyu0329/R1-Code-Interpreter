    "In the context of representation theory, the term \"tame\" describes a specific class of problems where the indecomposable representations can be classified. For a given dimension, the indecomposable representations of a tame algebra or, more generally, objects in a tame category, fall into a finite number of one-parameter families. This classification provides a way to \"resolve\" the representation theory of the object into a well-understood set of building blocks.\n\nAn upper semilattice `J` is a partially ordered set where every non-empty finite subset has a least upper bound (a join). When considering a functor `f` from `J` to the category of vector spaces `Vect_K`, the structure of `J` is crucial. The condition that `J` is an upper semilattice ensures that the category of tame functors, denoted `tame(J, Vect_K)`, is an abelian category. In such a category, every object has a minimal free resolution, making the homological properties well-behaved. This structure is essential for a robust decomposition theory.\n\nA functor `f: J -> Vect_K` is called tame if it is finitely determined, specifically if it is the left Kan extension of a functor from a finite poset. The essence of tameness in representation theory is that the indecomposable objects can be classified by a finite number of discrete parameters and one continuous parameter.\n\nThe term \"n-resolvable\" in this context refers to the number of parameters required to classify the indecomposable components into which a functor can be resolved or decomposed. Since a tame functor is, by definition, one whose indecomposable representations are organized into one-parameter families, it is considered 1-resolvable.\n\nThus, a tame functor `f: J -> Vect_K`, where `J` is an upper semilattice, is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
