    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt) can be determined by a specific formula when 'a' and 'b' are integers.\n\nThe given curve is described by the equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t), which is a Lissajous curve with a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nThis formula is applicable when 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1. In this case, a = 9 and b = 5 are coprime (gcd(9, 5) = 1), so the formula can be applied directly.\n\nSubstituting the values of a and b into the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
