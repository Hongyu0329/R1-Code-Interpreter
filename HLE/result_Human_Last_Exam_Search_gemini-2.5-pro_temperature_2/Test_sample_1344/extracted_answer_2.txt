An optimal single-site catalyst for dual-purpose olefin polymerization and polyolefin degradation would consist of a Group IV metal, specifically hafnium, supported on sulfated alumina. The catalyst would ideally be a simple organometallic precursor like tetra(neopentyl)hafnium. For polymerization, the supported catalyst would be used under standard olefin polymerization conditions. For degradation, the same catalyst would be subjected to hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures to induce hydrogenolysis, breaking the polyolefin down into short saturated alkanes. This system leverages the high activity of hafnium for both processes, the critical role of the sulfated alumina support in creating a highly reactive cationic active site, and the simplicity of the ligand which allows for both reactions to occur without steric hindrance.
