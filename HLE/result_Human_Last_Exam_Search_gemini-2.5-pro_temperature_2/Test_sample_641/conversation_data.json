    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4,q) depends on the parity of q and its residue modulo 4. An involution is an element of a group that is its own inverse. For PSU(4,q) where q is an odd prime power, there are two conjugacy classes of involutions if q ≡ 1 (mod 4) and four classes if q ≡ 3 (mod 4). In this case, we are interested in PSU(4,997). Since 997 is a prime number and 997 ≡ 1 (mod 4), there are two conjugacy classes of involutions in PSU(4,997).\n\nThe number of elements in a conjugacy class is given by the order of the group divided by the order of the centralizer of an element in that class. To find the total number of involutions, we need to sum the sizes of these two conjugacy classes.\n\nThe order of PSU(n,q) is given by the formula:\n|PSU(n,q)| = q^(n(n-1)/2) * Π_{i=2 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i) / gcd(n, q+1)\n\nFor PSU(4,997), n=4 and q=997. The order is:\n|PSU(4,997)| = 997^(4*3/2) * (997² - 1)(997³ + 1)(997⁴ - 1) / gcd(4, 997+1)\n|PSU(4,997)| = 997⁶ * (997² - 1)(997³ + 1)(997⁴ - 1) / 2\n\nAccording to studies on the subgroup structure of PSU(4,q), the centralizers of the two classes of involutions for q ≡ 1 (mod 4) have specific structures from which their orders can be derived. The number of involutions in the two classes are given by the expressions:\n*   q⁴(q²+1)(q²-q+1)\n*   q⁴(q+1)²(q²-q+1)\n\nThe total number of involutions is the sum of these two quantities:\nTotal involutions = q⁴(q²-q+1) * [(q²+1) + (q+1)²]\n= q⁴(q²-q+1) * [q²+1 + q²+2q+1]\n= q⁴(q²-q+1) * (2q²+2q+2)\n= 2q⁴(q²-q+1)(q²+q+1)\nUsing the identity (a-b)(a+b) = a²-b², the term (q²-q+1)(q²+q+1) can be seen as part of the expansion of (q⁶-1). A more direct expansion is `(q^2+1-q)(q^2+1+q) = (q^2+1)^2 - q^2 = q^4+2q^2+1-q^2 = q^4+q^2+1`.\nSo, the total number of involutions is **2q⁴(q⁴+q²+1)**.\n\nFor q = 997, we can now calculate the number of involutions:\nNumber of involutions = 2 * 997⁴ * (997⁴ + 997² + 1)\nFirst, we compute the powers of 997:\n*   997² = 994,009\n*   997⁴ = (994,009)² = 988,053,848,081\n\nNow substitute these values into the formula:\nNumber of involutions = 2 * 988,053,848,081 * (988,053,848,081 + 994,009 + 1)\nNumber of involutions = 2 * 988,053,848,081 * (988,054,842,091)\nNumber of involutions = 1,976,107,696,162 * 988,054,842,091\nNumber of involutions = 1,952,516,410,471,131,109,726,842\n\n<<<1952516410471131109726842>>>"
