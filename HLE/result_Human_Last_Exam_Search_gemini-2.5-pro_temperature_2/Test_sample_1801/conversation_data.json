    "The two Nobel laureates rumored to have been featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and a second individual who has been the subject of speculation but remains unidentified in available records.\n\nPhysicist and Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann's appearance in one of the \"Ask Why\" commercials, specifically the \"Metalman\" ad, is confirmed through various online sources, including a YouTube video of the commercial itself. In a recorded talk, Gell-Mann also recounted being asked to appear in a television commercial for a company he later identified as Enron, where he was asked to discuss the importance of questioning established principles.\n\nWhile there have been discussions and online forum posts suggesting a second individual, possibly of Indian descent, also appeared in the commercials, extensive research has not yielded a confirmed name or whether this person was a Nobel laureate. One of the \"Ask Why\" commercials did feature a pastiche of \"seemingly disconnected images that included everything from Ghandi to the NASA space shuttle,\" but does not name specific commentators.\n\nTherefore, based on available evidence, only the participation of Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann can be definitively confirmed.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and an unidentified individual>>>"
