    "Fourteen circles of radius one can be tightly packed into a larger circle. The problem of finding the smallest possible radius of the larger circle is a known mathematical problem in the field of circle packing.\n\nFor the specific case of 14 circles, the optimal packing arrangement has been mathematically proven. The arrangement consists of a central circle surrounded by a ring of the other 13 circles. The ratio of the radius of the larger circle (R) to the radius of the smaller circles (r) is a key value in determining the solution.\n\nAccording to a document by E. Specht on circle packings, for 14 circles packed in a larger circle, the ratio of the larger circle's radius to the smaller circle's radius is approximately 1.670183528370. In this problem, the smaller circles each have a radius of one (r=1).\n\nTherefore, the radius of the larger containing circle (R) is:\nR = r * ratio\nR = 1 * 1.670183528370\nR â‰ˆ 1.67018\n\nRounding this value to four significant digits, the radius of the large circle is 1.670.\n\n<<<1.670>>>"
