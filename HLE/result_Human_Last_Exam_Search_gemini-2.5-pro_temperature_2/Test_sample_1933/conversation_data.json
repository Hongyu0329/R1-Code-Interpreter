    "### The VC Dimension of Existential Conjunctive First-Order Logic on Unary Predicates\n\nThe Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a logic measures the complexity of the classes of models that can be defined by its sentences. Specifically, we consider a set system where the \"points\" are the possible structures (models) over the schema S, and the \"sets\" are the collections of structures that satisfy a given formula in the logic. The VC dimension is the size of the largest set of structures that can be \"shattered\". A set of structures is shattered if for each of its subsets, there exists a formula in the logic that is satisfied by precisely the structures in that subset.\n\nThe schema S contains 4 unary predicates, let's denote them as {P₁, P₂, P₃, P₄}. The logic in question, denoted as $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, allows for sentences formed using existential quantification (∃), conjunction (∧), and the constants for true (⊤) and false (⊥).\n\nA sentence in this logic asserts the existence of elements satisfying certain combinations of these unary predicates. Any sentence in this logic is equivalent to a conjunction of simpler sentences. These basic sentences are of the form:\n\n$\\psi_I = \\exists x \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$\n\nwhere *I* is a non-empty subset of {1, 2, 3, 4}. This sentence is true in a structure if and only if the intersection of the extensions of the predicates *Pᵢ* for all *i* in *I* is non-empty.\n\nThere are $2^4 - 1 = 15$ such non-empty subsets *I*, and consequently, there are 15 such fundamental sentences. Any other sentence in this logic is a conjunction of these 15 basic sentence types. For example, the formula $\\exists x \\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y) \\land P_3(x))$ is equivalent to $(\\exists x (P_1(x) \\land P_3(x))) \\land (\\exists y P_2(y))$, which is $\\psi_{\\{1,3\\}} \\land \\psi_{\\{2\\}}$.\n\nThe set of all definable classes of models is therefore the collection of sets formed by finite intersections of the model sets of these 15 basic sentences. This forms an intersection-closed system generated by 15 sets.\n\nTo determine the VC dimension of this system, one can construct a set of 15 structures that is shattered by the formulas of the logic. Let the non-empty subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4} be indexed from 1 to 15. For each index *j* corresponding to a non-empty subset *J* ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4}, we can define a structure $\\mathcal{M}_J$ with a single element that satisfies exactly the predicates in *J*.\n\nIt can be shown that for any subset of these 15 structures, a formula can be constructed within the logic that is satisfied by exactly those structures. This demonstrates that this set of 15 structures can be shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 15. The VC dimension of an intersection-closed system generated by *d* sets is at most *d*. In this case, *d* = 15. Combining these, the VC dimension is exactly 15.\n\nThe VC dimension is thus the number of non-empty subsets of the set of 4 predicates.\n\n<<<15>>>"
