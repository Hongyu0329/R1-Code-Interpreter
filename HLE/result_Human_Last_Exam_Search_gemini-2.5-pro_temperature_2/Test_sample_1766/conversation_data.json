    "To solve for the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared, $J^2$, and its z-component, $J_z$, for a p-electron, we must first understand the quantum numbers involved.\n\nA p-electron is characterized by an orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l* = 1. As an electron, it has an intrinsic spin angular momentum quantum number, *s* = 1/2.\n\nIn a system with spin-orbit coupling, the orbital angular momentum **L** and the spin angular momentum **S** are no longer conserved independently. Instead, they combine to form the total angular momentum **J**:\n\n**J** = **L** + **S**\n\nThe operators for the squared total angular momentum, $J^2$, and its projection onto the z-axis, $J_z$, commute with the Hamiltonian, meaning we can find simultaneous eigenstates for them.\n\n### Determining the Quantum Numbers\n\nThe total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, is determined by the rule for adding angular momenta. The possible values of *j* range from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\n\nFor a p-electron:\n*   *l* = 1\n*   *s* = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the possible values for *j* are:\n*   *j* = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   *j* = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nSo, the p-electron can exist in two states, one with *j* = 3/2 and another with *j* = 1/2.\n\nFor each value of *j*, the magnetic quantum number, *m<sub>j</sub>*, which corresponds to the eigenvalue of $J_z$, can take on values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps (i.e., 2*j* + 1 possible values).\n\n### Calculating the Eigenvalues\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J^2$ and $J_z$ operators are given by:\n*   Eigenvalue of $J^2$ = *j*(*j* + 1)ħ²\n*   Eigenvalue of $J_z$ = *m<sub>j</sub>*ħ\n\nUsing the determined *j* values, we can find the corresponding eigenvalues:\n\n**For the state with j = 3/2:**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²**:\n    (3/2)(3/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/2)(5/2)ħ² = (15/4)ħ²\n\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz**:\n    The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. This results in four degenerate states (in the absence of an external field). The corresponding eigenvalues for $J_z$ are:\n    -3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, 3/2 ħ\n\n**For the state with j = 1/2:**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²**:\n    (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (1/2)(3/2)ħ² = (3/4)ħ²\n\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz**:\n    The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -1/2 and 1/2. This results in two degenerate states. The corresponding eigenvalues for $J_z$ are:\n    -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ\n\nIn summary, the spin-orbit coupling splits the p-level into two distinct energy levels, often denoted by term symbols ²P₃/₂ and ²P₁/₂, corresponding to the *j* values of 3/2 and 1/2, respectively. Each of these levels has a set of common eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$.\n\n<<<**For j = 3/2:**\n*   Eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ².\n*   Eigenvalues of Jz are -3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, 3/2 ħ.\n\n**For j = 1/2:**\n*   Eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ².\n*   Eigenvalues of Jz are -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ.>>>"
