    "According to Brooks's theorem, for any connected graph G with maximum degree Δ(G), the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ(G), unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle. If G is a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is Δ(G) + 1.\n\nThe problem considers a graph G with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph. We want to find the maximum possible number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of G. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible value for the chromatic number χ(G).\n\nFirst, let's establish an upper bound for the chromatic number of such a graph. A graph on n vertices requires n colors if and only if it is a complete graph (a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge). Since the graph G with 12345 vertices is explicitly stated not to be a complete graph, it must require fewer than 12345 colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of G must be at most 12344.\n\nNext, we need to determine if a non-complete graph G with 12345 vertices can have a chromatic number of 12344. To do this, we can construct such a graph.\n\nConsider a graph G constructed as follows:\n*   Take a complete subgraph with 12344 vertices, let's call it K_12344.\n*   Add a single vertex, let's call it 'v', to the graph. This new vertex 'v' is not connected to any of the vertices in K_12344.\n\nThis graph G has a total of 12345 vertices.\n*   **Is G a complete graph?** No, because the vertex 'v' is not connected to any other vertex in the graph.\n*   **What is the chromatic number of G?** The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. The components of G are the complete graph K_12344 and the single vertex 'v'. The chromatic number of K_12344 is 12344. The chromatic number of a single vertex is 1. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is max(12344, 1) = 12344.\n\nSince we have demonstrated that a non-complete graph on 12345 vertices can have a chromatic number of 12344, and we have established that the chromatic number cannot exceed 12344, the maximum number of colors required is 12344.\n\nAnother example would be to take the complete graph on 12345 vertices, K_12345, and remove a single edge. Let this new graph be G'.\n*   The maximum degree of G' is Δ(G') = 12344.\n*   G' is not a complete graph, and it is also not an odd cycle.\n*   According to Brooks's Theorem, the chromatic number of G' is less than or equal to its maximum degree, so χ(G') ≤ 12344.\n*   The two vertices from which the edge was removed can be given the same color, and all other 12343 vertices must have distinct colors, different from the first pair. This leads to a total of 1 + 12343 = 12344 colors. Thus, the chromatic number is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
