    "Based on my research, which included ignoring Gettier problems as requested, two significant problems with the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge emerge. The first is a foundational issue concerning the nature of the \"justification\" condition itself, and the second is a logical consequence of accepting the \"truth\" condition as absolute. These problems are present even when restricting the available epistemic states to only Knowledge and Belief.\n\nThe two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress for Justification:** The JTB definition requires a belief to be justified to count as knowledge. However, the theory does not specify how justification works. Typically, a belief is justified by other beliefs. For someone to *know* a proposition 'P', they must be justified in believing 'P'. If this justification rests on another belief, 'Q', then to truly be justified, 'Q' must also be justified. This leads to a chain of required justifications. This chain must either end in a belief that is not justified (making the entire chain unjustified), circle back on itself (circular reasoning), or continue infinitely (an infinite regress). The JTB theory itself does not solve this problem, leaving a critical component of its definition unexplained and vulnerable. Foundationalist theories attempt to solve this by positing certain \"basic\" beliefs that are self-justifying and terminate the chain.\n\n2.  **The Dogmatism Paradox:** If an individual knows a proposition 'P', then according to the JTB definition, 'P' must be true. Since 'P' is true, any evidence that emerges against 'P' must necessarily be misleading evidence. Knowing this, the individual would be logically correct to resolve to ignore any and all future counter-evidence. This creates a paradox: the JTB definition of knowledge implies that a person who knows something should be dogmatic and no longer open to new evidence that might challenge their belief. This is problematic because it seems to position knowledge as something that is closed off from further inquiry, which is counterintuitive to the rational and scientific process of updating beliefs in the face of new information.\n\n<<<The two problems JTB runs into, when ignoring Gettier problems and only considering Knowledge and Belief as epistemic states, are the problem of infinite regress for the justification condition and the dogmatism paradox that arises from the truth condition.>>>"
