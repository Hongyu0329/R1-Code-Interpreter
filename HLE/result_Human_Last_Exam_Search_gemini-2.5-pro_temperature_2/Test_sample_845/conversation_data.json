    "The value computed between heartbeats, derived from the beat-to-beat intervals captured by photoplethysmography (PPG) to calculate heart rate variability (HRV), is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhile the term \"RR interval\" is used for measurements from an electrocardiogram (ECG), IBI is the more general and appropriate term when using PPG, which measures the time between pulses. This measurement of the time elapsed between two consecutive heartbeats is the fundamental data point used to quantify HRV.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)>>>"
