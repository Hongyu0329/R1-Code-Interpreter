    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nVoznesensky's poem \"Saga\" (1977), which formed the libretto for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" tells the story of Rezanov's voyage to Spanish California in 1806. During this expedition, Rezanov, a 42-year-old widower, met and fell in love with the 15-year-old Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco.\n\nRezanov traveled back to Russia to seek the Tsar's permission to marry the Catholic Concepción, promising to return to her in two years. However, he fell ill while crossing Siberia, died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and was buried there. His grave was later destroyed by the Bolsheviks. Concepción, unaware of his death for many years, never married and eventually became a nun.\n\nThe questions in Voznesensky's poem about the location of Rezanov's final resting place were answered when his presumed grave site in Krasnoyarsk was rediscovered, leading to a memorial service and the dedication of a new monument in the late 20th century. In a symbolic reunion in 2000, earth and a rose from Concepción's grave in Benicia, California, were brought to Rezanov's tomb, and soil from his grave was taken to hers.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
