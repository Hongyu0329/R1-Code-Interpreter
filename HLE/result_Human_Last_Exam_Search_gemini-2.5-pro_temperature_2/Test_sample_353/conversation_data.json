    "The $A(\\alpha)$-stability of a numerical method refers to the property where the region of absolute stability contains a wedge-shaped sector in the left half of the complex plane, symmetric with respect to the negative real axis, with a half-angle of $\\alpha$. A method is considered $A(\\alpha)$-stable if its region of absolute stability includes the set of complex numbers $z$ such that $|\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha$, for $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$.\n\nFor the Backward Differentiation Formula of order 4 (BDF4), the boundary of the stability region is given by the root locus curve. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangent to this curve from the origin. While early numerical computations by NÃ¸rsett suggested that $\\alpha \\approx 73.3^{\\circ}$, recent analytical work has provided the exact value.\n\nIn 2019, Akrivis and Katsoprinakis determined the exact maximum angles of $A(\\alpha)$-stability for the BDF methods. For the BDF4 scheme, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is derived from its cosine. The square of the cosine of the angle is given by:\n\n$\\cos^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{50 - \\sqrt{2033}}{289}$\n\nTo express this in terms of $\\arctan()$, we can use the identity $\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{1 - \\cos^2(\\alpha)}{\\cos^2(\\alpha)}$.\n$1 - \\cos^2(\\alpha) = 1 - \\frac{50 - \\sqrt{2033}}{289} = \\frac{289 - (50 - \\sqrt{2033})}{289} = \\frac{239 + \\sqrt{2033}}{289}$\n\nTherefore,\n$\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\frac{239 + \\sqrt{2033}}{289}}{\\frac{50 - \\sqrt{2033}}{289}} = \\frac{239 + \\sqrt{2033}}{50 - \\sqrt{2033}}$\n\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{239 + \\sqrt{2033}}{50 - \\sqrt{2033}}}\\right)$\n\nNumerically, this value is approximately $\\alpha \\approx \\arctan(\\sqrt{57.843}) \\approx \\arctan(7.605) \\approx 1.440$ radians, or $82.52^{\\circ}$.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{239 + \\sqrt{2033}}{50 - \\sqrt{2033}}}\\right)$>>>"
