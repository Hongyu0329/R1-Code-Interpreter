    "Despite a thorough search for information regarding Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009, a definitive count of the number of entrelacés performed in her variation could not be located in available online resources.\n\nNumerous sources confirm that Osipova performed the role of Nikiya for the first time with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. Video clips of this performance, specifically the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene, are also referenced and available on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok.\n\nHowever, a detailed choreographic analysis or a step-by-step breakdown of this specific performance that would include the number of entrelacés is not present in the search results. Reviews and articles discuss her performance in general terms, often highlighting her \"famously explosive jump\" and overall technical prowess, but do not provide a quantitative analysis of the individual ballet steps.\n\nWithout the ability to watch and analyze the video footage directly, which is a current limitation, or a written account detailing the choreography of that particular variation, it is not possible to provide a precise number of entrelacés.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number as I cannot watch the video of the performance to count the steps, and a written choreographic breakdown with this information is not available in the search results.>>>"
