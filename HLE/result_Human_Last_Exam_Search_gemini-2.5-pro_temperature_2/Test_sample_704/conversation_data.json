    "In Isaac Newton's groundbreaking work, *Opticks*, he proposed a connection between the colors of the visible light spectrum and the notes of a musical scale. The combination of yellow and blue light produces the color green. On Newton's colour circle, the range between the colour green and the colour blue corresponds to a specific musical note that marks the boundary between these two hues.\n\nNewton arranged the seven colors of the spectrum—Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet—in a circle, analogous to the seven notes of a musical mode. He specifically chose the Dorian mode, starting on the note D. In his original diagrams, the letters representing the musical notes (D, E, F, G, A, B, C) are placed on the dividing lines, or spokes, between the color segments.\n\nFollowing this arrangement:\n*   The segment for Yellow lies between the notes F and G.\n*   The segment for Green lies between the notes G and A.\n*   The segment for Blue lies between the notes A and B.\n\nThis placement means the note **G** is located precisely at the boundary separating the green and blue sectors of the colour circle. Therefore, G is the musical note that corresponds to the transition between green and blue.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in modern color terminology, Newton's \"blue\" might be closer to what we call cyan or blue-green today, while his \"indigo\" would correspond to our modern concept of blue.\n\n<<<G>>>"
