    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we need to determine two quantities: the dimension of the system of differential equations (n) and the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).\n\nFor a linear boundary-value problem involving a system of `n` first-order ordinary differential equations with `k` linearly independent boundary conditions, the problem corresponds to a Fredholm operator, and its index is given by the formula:\n\nIndex = k - n\n\n### 1. Determine the Dimension of the System (n)\n\nThe problem defines the unknown function `x(t)` as a vector:\n$$\nx(t) = (x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), x_{3}(t), ..., x_{2024}(t))\n$$\nThis explicitly states that the system consists of 2024 coupled ordinary differential equations (one for each component of `x(t)`). Therefore, the dimension of the system is `n = 2024`.\n\nThe description of the matrix `A` and the vector `I(t)` having up to 202,000 components is inconsistent with the definition of `x(t)` and the boundary conditions provided. The highest index mentioned in the boundary conditions is 2024. Thus, we proceed with the clearly defined dimension of `x(t)`.\n\n### 2. Determine the Number of Linearly Independent Boundary Conditions (k)\n\nThe boundary conditions are given as:\n1.  `x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0`\n2.  `x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0`\n3.  `5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0`\n4.  `100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0`\n5.  `1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0`\n6.  `100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0`\n\nWe need to identify the number of unique, linearly independent equations:\n*   **Condition 1:** `x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0` is an independent condition.\n*   **Condition 2:** `x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0` is an independent condition.\n*   **Condition 3:** `5(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0` is just 5 times condition 2, so it is linearly dependent.\n*   **Condition 4:** `100(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0` is 100 times condition 2, making it linearly dependent.\n*   **Condition 5:** `-1000(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0` is -1000 times condition 2, also linearly dependent.\n*   **Condition 6:** `100(x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0)) = 0`, which simplifies to `x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0`, is another independent condition.\n\nCounting the linearly independent conditions, we have one for `x₁`, one for `x₂`, and one for `x₂₀₂₄`. Thus, there are `k = 3` linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Index\n\nUsing the formula for the index of the boundary-value problem:\nIndex = k - n\nIndex = 3 - 2024\nIndex = -2021\n\nThe index of the considered problem is -2021.\n\n<<< -2021 >>>"
