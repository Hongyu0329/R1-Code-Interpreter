    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to find the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression. The problem involves interpreting a complex functional expression as a Church numeral. Church numerals are a way to represent natural numbers using higher-order functions. A number `n` is represented by a function that takes another function, `f`, and a value, `x`, and applies `f` to `x` a total of `n` times (`f(f(...f(x)...))`).\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's simplify this by first identifying and reducing its components:\n*   **B combinator (Composition):** The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the `B` combinator, which represents function composition. Its reduction rule is `Bxyz = x(yz)`.\n*   **U combinator (Self-application):** The sub-expression `S(I)(I)` is the `U` combinator (often called the mockingbird combinator), which applies its argument to itself: `Ux = xx`.\n*   **Identity combinator `I`:** `Ix = x`.\n\nSubstituting these into the main expression, we get:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(B(I)))))(B(U)))`\n\nThis expression appears to be constructed by repeatedly applying the `S(I)` term. In some systems of Church numerals, `S(I)` acts as the successor function (the function that adds one to a number). Let's test this interpretation. The expression has the structure `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(X))))`, which would correspond to `succ(succ(succ(X)))`, where `X` is the innermost term `(S(I)(K(B(I))))(B(U))`.\n\nFor this structure to be valid, `X` must itself be a Church numeral. We can evaluate `X` by reducing it:\n1.  Let's first analyze the term `A = S(I)(K(B(I)))`. When `A` is applied to a function `g`, it reduces as follows: `Ag = (S(I)(K(B(I))))g = (Ig)(K(B(I))g) = g(B(I))`.\n2.  Now let's consider the term `X = A(B(U))`. By substituting `g` with `B(U)`, we get `X = (B(U))(B(I))`.\n3.  Let's evaluate `X` by applying it to a function `f`. `Xf = ((B(U))(B(I)))f = B(U)((B(I))f)`.\n4.  The inner part `(B(I))f` reduces to `f` because `B(I)fx = I(fx) = fx`.\n5.  So, `Xf` simplifies to `B(U)f`, which reduces to `Î»x. U(fx)`. Since `U` self-applies its argument, `U(fx)` becomes `(fx)(fx)`.\n6.  The final reduced expression for `X` applied to `f` and `x` is `(fx)(fx)`.\n\nWe now have the reduced form of the original expression `n` applied to a function `f` and a value `x`:\n`n f x = f(f(f((fx)(fx))))`\n\nTo find the integer value of `n`, we can interpret the function applications as arithmetic operations. If we consider `f` to be multiplication by a factor `a` and `x` to be `1`, the expression becomes `a * (a * (a * ((a*1)*(a*1))))`. This simplifies to `a * (a * (a * a^2)) = a * (a * a^3) = a * a^4 = a^4`. Since a standard Church numeral `n` computes `f^n(x)`, this calculation implies that `n=4`.\n\nWith `n=4`, we can now calculate the final answer.\n\n`log_2(n) = log_2(4) = 2`.\n\n<<<2>>>"
