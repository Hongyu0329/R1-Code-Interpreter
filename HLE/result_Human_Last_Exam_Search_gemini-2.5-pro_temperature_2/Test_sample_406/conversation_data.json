    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence of such a fixed point is guaranteed under specific conditions, typically in the framework of partially ordered metric spaces. These conditions are extensions of the well-known Banach Fixed Point Theorem to a multi-dimensional setting.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n### 1. The underlying space:\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means that for each set, say X, there is a metric dX, a partial order relation ≤, and every Cauchy sequence in X converges to a point in X.\n\n### 2. Mixed Monotone Property:\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property\". While the exact definition can vary slightly between different works, a common formulation involves the functions being non-decreasing or non-increasing with respect to their arguments. For the given function signatures, the property would be defined as follows:\n\nLet (X, ≤X), (Y, ≤Y), and (Z, ≤Z) be partially ordered sets.\n*   **F: X × Y × Z → X** has the mixed monotone property if for any x, x1, x2 ∈ X, y, y1, y2 ∈ Y, and z, z1, z2 ∈ Z:\n    *   If x1 ≤X x2, then F(x1, y, z) ≤X F(x2, y, z) (F is non-decreasing in the first argument).\n    *   If y1 ≤Y y2, then F(x, y1, z) ≥X F(x, y2, z) (F is non-increasing in the second argument).\n    *   If z1 ≤Z z2, then F(x, y, z1) ≤X F(x, y, z2) (F is non-decreasing in the third argument).\n*   **G: Y × X × Y → Y** has the mixed monotone property if for any y, y1, y2 ∈ Y and x, x1, x2 ∈ X:\n    *   If y1 ≤Y y2, then G(y1, x, y) ≤Y G(y2, x, y) (G is non-decreasing in the first argument).\n    *   If x1 ≤X x2, then G(y, x1, y) ≥Y G(y, x2, y) (G is non-increasing in the second argument).\n    *   If y1 ≤Y y2, then G(y, x, y1) ≤Y G(y, x, y2) (G is non-decreasing in the third argument).\n*   **H: Z × Y × X → Z** has the mixed monotone property if for any z, z1, z2 ∈ Z, y, y1, y2 ∈ Y, and x, x1, x2 ∈ X:\n    *   If z1 ≤Z z2, then H(z1, y, x) ≤Z H(z2, y, x) (H is non-decreasing in the first argument).\n    *   If y1 ≤Y y2, then H(z, y1, x) ≥Z H(z, y2, x) (H is non-increasing in the second argument).\n    *   If x1 ≤X x2, then H(z, y, x1) ≤Z H(z, y, x2) (H is non-decreasing in the third argument).\n\n### 3. Contractive Condition:\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive condition. This is a generalization of the contraction mapping principle. A common form of this condition is:\n\nThere exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w:\n\nd(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ k * d(x, u) + l * d(y, v) + m * d(z, w)\nd(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ k * d(y, v) + l * d(x, u) + m * d(y, v)\nd(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d(z, w) + l * d(y, v) + m * d(x, u)\n\n### 4. Existence of an Initial Point:\nThere must exist initial points x0 ∈ X, y0 ∈ Y, and z0 ∈ Z such that:\n*   x0 ≤ F(x0, y0, z0)\n*   y0 ≥ G(y0, x0, y0)\n*   z0 ≤ H(z0, y0, x0)\n\n### 5. Continuity or an Alternative Condition:\nEither the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the spaces (X, dX, ≤X), (Y, dY, ≤Y), and (Z, dZ, ≤Z) have the following property:\n*   For any non-decreasing sequence {xn} in X that converges to x, we have xn ≤ x for all n.\n*   For any non-increasing sequence {yn} in Y that converges to y, we have yn ≥ y for all n.\n*   For any non-decreasing sequence {zn} in Z that converges to z, we have zn ≤ z for all n.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then there exist x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, and z ∈ Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. Furthermore, if the product space X × Y × Z has the property that for every pair of elements (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2), there exists a (u, v, w) that is comparable to both, then the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique.\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence of such a fixed point is guaranteed under specific conditions, typically in the framework of partially ordered metric spaces.
