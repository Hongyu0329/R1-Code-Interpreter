    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the large $x$ regime, we first analyze the behavior of each term in the equation as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe given ODE is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large values of $x$, we make the following approximations:\n1.  The term $\\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2}$ becomes negligible, as the denominator grows quadratically with $x$. This assumption is valid provided $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$.\n2.  The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$ is a bounded, oscillating function with singularities. In the context of finding a smooth asymptotic behavior, such oscillatory terms are often neglected or averaged. We will proceed by assuming this term's contribution is negligible compared to the dominant terms for large $x$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the ODE simplifies to:\n$y''' \\approx y^{4} + y'^{4}$\n\nWe seek a solution of the form $y(x) = C x^a$, which is a common trial form for asymptotic analysis (ansatz).\nThe derivatives are:\n$y'(x) = C a x^{a-1}$\n$y''(x) = C a (a-1) x^{a-2}$\n$y'''(x) = C a (a-1) (a-2) x^{a-3}$\n\nSubstituting these into the simplified ODE:\n$C a (a-1) (a-2) x^{a-3} \\approx (C x^a)^4 + (C a x^{a-1})^4 = C^4 x^{4a} + C^4 a^4 x^{4a-4}$\n\nTo find a balance for large $x$, we must equate the dominant powers of $x$. The term with the highest power of $x$ on the right-hand side is $C^4 x^{4a}$ (since $4a > 4a-4$). Equating the powers of the dominant terms on both sides:\n$a - 3 = 4a$\n$3a = -3$\n$a = -1$\n\nThis indicates a decaying solution. With $a=-1$, the powers in our approximate equation become:\n- Left-hand side: $x^{a-3} = x^{-4}$\n- Right-hand side: $x^{4a} = x^{-4}$ and $x^{4a-4} = x^{-8}$\nSince $x^{-4}$ dominates $x^{-8}$ for large $x$, our choice of the dominant term on the right-hand side is consistent.\n\nNow we solve for the constant coefficient $C$ by substituting $a=-1$ into the equation for the coefficients:\n$C (-1)(-1-1)(-1-2) = C^4$\n$C (-1)(-2)(-3) = C^4$\n$-6C = C^4$\n$C^4 + 6C = 0$\n$C(C^3 + 6) = 0$\n\nThis gives two possible solutions for C: the trivial solution $C=0$ (which corresponds to $y(x)=0$) and the non-trivial solution from $C^3 = -6$.\n$C = \\sqrt{-6} = -\\sqrt{6}$\n\nThe value of the constant is approximately:\n$C = -\\sqrt{6} \\approx -1.81712$\n\nRounding this to two decimal places, we get $C \\approx -1.82$.\n\nThus, the analytical expression that approximates the solution for large $x$ is:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\frac{1.82}{x}$\n\nThis solution is an \"attractor\" for a certain class of initial conditions, assuming the neglected terms do not fundamentally alter the long-term behavior.\n\n<<<y(x) = -1.82/x>>>"
