    "The category $C$ consists of the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let this root of unity be denoted by $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$.\n\nThe representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity is a classical topic. The small quantum group, which is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra of dimension $l^3$ where $l=3$, is known to be of wild representation type for $l \\ge 3$. An algebra of wild type has infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. Since there are only a finite number of irreducible (simple) representations, a literal interpretation of the question would mean the percentage is 0%, as the number of irreducibles is finite while the total number of indecomposables is infinite. This is a trivial answer, which suggests that the scope of the category $C$ is likely intended to be a specific, well-behaved subcategory.\n\nIn the context of quantum groups at roots of unity, a standard and important subcategory to study is the category of tilting modules. For the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, it is a known theorem that the tilting modules are precisely the projective modules. Assuming the question implicitly refers to this category, we can find a finite number of objects and a non-trivial percentage.\n\nLet's identify the indecomposable projective modules and determine which of them are irreducible.\n\n1.  **Simple Modules:** For $q$ a primitive $l$-th root of unity, the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ has exactly $l$ non-isomorphic simple modules. For $l=3$, there are three simple modules, which we can denote as $L_1, L_2,$ and $L_3$. Their dimensions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\n2.  **Projective Indecomposable Modules (PIMs):** The number of non-isomorphic PIMs for a finite-dimensional algebra is equal to the number of non-isomorphic simple modules. Therefore, there are three PIMs, which are the projective covers of the simple modules: $P_1, P_2,$ and $P_3$.\n\n3.  **Irreducible Projective Modules:** A PIM, $P_i$, is irreducible if and only if it is isomorphic to the simple module $L_i$ it covers. For the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $q$ being an $l$-th root of unity, the simple module $L_k$ is projective if and only if its dimension is $l$. In our case, $l=3$, so only the simple module of dimension 3, namely $L_3$, is projective.\n    *   This means $P_3 \\cong L_3$.\n    *   The simple modules $L_1$ (dimension 1) and $L_2$ (dimension 2) are not projective. Thus, their projective covers, $P_1$ and $P_2$, are strictly larger than their simple quotients and are therefore not irreducible.\n\nBased on this analysis, the set of indecomposable projective modules is $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$. The subset of these modules that are also irreducible is $\\{P_3\\}$.\n\n*   Total number of indecomposable projective modules = 3.\n*   Number of irreducible projective modules = 1.\n\nThe percentage of objects in this category that are irreducible is the ratio of these two numbers:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Number of Irreducible Projective Modules}}{\\text{Total Number of Indecomposable Projective Modules}} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nThe percentage is $1/3 \\times 100\\% = 33.33...\\%$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
