    "### Equilibrium Properties of Photon Gas from Large Deviation Theory\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas) can be determined using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically through the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. This approach provides a rigorous foundation for the results of Bose and Planck, framing them within the context of the statistical likelihood of macroscopic states.\n\n#### Conceptual Framework\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state of an isolated system is the one with the highest probability, corresponding to the maximum number of microscopic configurations. Large deviation theory provides the mathematical tools to quantify the exponential decay of the probability of observing a macroscopic state that deviates from this most likely state. The key insight is that the equilibrium state is the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function, which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy.\n\nFor a system of photons in thermal equilibrium (black-body radiation), a crucial characteristic is that the number of photons is not conserved, which implies that their chemical potential is zero. The equilibrium distribution is established through the interaction of photons with the container's walls.\n\n#### Application of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff Theorems\n\n1.  **Distribution of Photons and Sanov's Theorem:** A photon gas can be described by the distribution of photons across different energy levels (or frequency modes). Sanov's theorem states that the probability of observing an empirical distribution of particles that deviates from the true equilibrium distribution is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the two distributions. In the context of a photon gas, the equilibrium distribution is the one that maximizes the statistical weight (or minimizes the relative entropy, subject to constraints), which aligns with Boltzmann's principle. This leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number of a state with energy `hν`.\n\n2.  **Energy Distribution and Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** The Cramer-Chernoff theorem deals with large deviations in the sum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, which can be applied to the total energy of the system. The theorem establishes a large deviation upper bound on the probability of the total energy fluctuating from its mean value. The rate function in this theorem, which is minimized at equilibrium, is directly related to the thermodynamic free energy.\n\n#### Derivation of Equilibrium Values\n\nA recent study by D. P. Shinde explicitly demonstrates how these large deviation theorems can be used to derive the equilibrium properties of a photon gas. The core of the derivation is as follows:\n\n*   The system is considered as an ensemble of photons distributed among various energy states.\n*   The Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical entropy (S) is taken to be proportional to the logarithm of the probability of a given macroscopic state.\n*   At thermodynamic equilibrium, this entropy reaches its maximum value. Simultaneously, the corresponding Cramer-Chernoff large deviation function attains its minimum value.\n*   The equilibrium condition is found by maximizing the entropy under the constraint of a fixed total mean energy. This is achieved using the method of Lagrange multipliers, where the multiplier `β` is introduced, which is later identified as `1/(kT)`, with `k` being the Boltzmann constant and `T` the absolute temperature.\n*   The number of available quantum states in a frequency interval `ν` to `ν + dν` per unit volume, as famously derived by Bose, is given by `A_s = (8πν^2/c^3)dν`. This is a critical input for obtaining the final expressions for the thermodynamic quantities.\n\n#### Equilibrium Mean Energy and Entropy\n\nThrough the application of this large deviation framework, the well-known expressions for the equilibrium mean energy and entropy of a photon gas are reproduced.\n\nThe **mean energy (U)** of the photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is obtained by integrating the energy density over all frequencies:\n$$ U = \\frac{8\\pi^5 k^4}{15h^3c^3} V T^4 $$\nThis can be written as `U = aVT^4`, where `a` is the radiation constant. This result follows from finding the mean energy using the derived Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\n\nThe **entropy (S)** of the photon gas is found to be:\n$$ S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 k^4}{45h^3c^3} V T^3 $$\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the mean energy as `S = (4/3) a V T^3 = (4/3) U/T`.\n\nIn conclusion, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems provide a rigorous probabilistic foundation for the equilibrium properties of a photon gas. They confirm that the state of maximum entropy, which is the most probable macroscopic state, corresponds to the well-established expressions for the mean energy and entropy of black-body radiation derived by Planck and Bose.\n\n<<<The equilibrium mean energy (U) of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by  `U = (8π^5 k^4 / 15h^3c^3) V T^4`. The equilibrium entropy (S) is given by `S = (32π^5 k^4 / 45h^3c^3) V T^3`.>>>"
