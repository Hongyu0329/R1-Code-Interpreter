    "The area of the smallest square that can outcircle the given figure is 36.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. Analyze the parametric curve in two parts:**\n\n*   **For the interval  t  ∈ [0,  π  ]:** The equations are  x  = cos(t) and  y  = sin(t). This is the standard parametrization for the upper half of a unit circle ($x^2 + y^2 = 1$, where y ≥ 0).\n*   **For the interval  t  ∈ ( π , 2 π ):** The equations are  x  = cos(t) and  y  = 5sin(t). This represents the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with the equation $(x/1)^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$ where y < 0.\n\n**2. Determine the bounding box of the figure:**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the shape, we first need to find the minimum and maximum x and y values the curve reaches.\n\n*   **Width (x-dimension):** The x-coordinate is given by  x  = cos(t) for the entire interval of  t  from 0 to 2π. The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, the minimum x-value is -1 and the maximum x-value is 1. The total width of the figure is 1 - (-1) = 2.\n*   **Height (y-dimension):**\n    *   For the upper part (circle),  y  = sin(t) ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   For the lower part (ellipse),  y  = 5sin(t) ranges from -5 to 0.\n    *   Combining these, the overall y-range is from -5 to 1. The total height of the figure is 1 - (-5) = 6.\n\n**3. Find the smallest enclosing square:**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle that has a width of 2 and a height of 6. A square that encloses (\"outcircles\") this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n\n*   Side length of the smallest square = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6.\n\n**4. Calculate the area:**\n\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n\n*   Area = 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
