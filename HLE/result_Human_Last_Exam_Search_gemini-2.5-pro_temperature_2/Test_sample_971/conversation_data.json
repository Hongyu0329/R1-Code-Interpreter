    "Despite a thorough search for a video of Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of *Don Quixote*, a viewable copy of the Act I variation from that specific year could not be located. While numerous references to this performance exist, including clips from a guest appearance in Novosibirsk, the videos are consistently unavailable.\n\nConsequently, it is not possible to provide a definitive count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that she executed in that particular performance. Videos of Osipova performing the same role in other years are available, but do not suffice to answer the specific question about the 2008 production.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question as I cannot locate a viewable video of the 2008 performance in question.>>>"
