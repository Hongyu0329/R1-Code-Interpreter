    "This is a logic puzzle. I have analyzed the transformation rules from the provided examples.\n\nThe rule can be described as follows:\n1.  Locate the character '2' in the input grid.\n2.  The '2' looks for a diagonal neighbor cell that contains a '0'.\n3.  The search for the '0' follows a specific priority order for the diagonal directions: Top-Right, Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Bottom-Left.\n4.  The '2' \"moves\" to the first '0' found in this search order.\n5.  The original cell of the '2' becomes a '0', and the destination cell (which was a '0') becomes a '2'.\n\nLet's apply this rule to `Input_C`:\n\n*   **Input_C:** '000000,011120,111111'\n\n1.  First, we represent the input as a grid:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n2.  The character '2' is located at row 1, column 4 (using 0-based indexing).\n\n3.  We check its diagonal neighbors in the specified order:\n    *   **Top-Right:** The cell at (row 1-1, col 4+1) = (0, 5). The value in this cell is '0'.\n    *   Since we found a '0' on our first check, this will be the destination for the '2'.\n\n4.  The transformation is executed:\n    *   The '2' at position (1, 4) becomes a '0'.\n    *   The '0' at position (0, 5) becomes a '2'.\n\n5.  The resulting grid is:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 2\n    0 1 1 1 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n6.  Converting this grid back to the comma-separated string format gives the final output.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
