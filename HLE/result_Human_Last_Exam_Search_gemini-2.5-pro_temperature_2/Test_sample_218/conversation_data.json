    "The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, denoted as $S_{25}$, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer 25. The dimension of each irrep is determined by its corresponding partition through the Hook Length Formula. To find the number of irreps with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, one must identify the partitions of 25 that yield such dimensions.\n\nThe dimensions of the irreps for various partitions are calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Partitions with one part:** The partition (25) corresponds to the trivial representation, which has a dimension of 1. Its conjugate, the partition $(1^{25})$, corresponds to the sign representation, also with a dimension of 1.\n*   **Partitions corresponding to hooks:** For partitions of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$, known as hook partitions, the dimension of the corresponding irrep of $S_n$ is given by the formula $\\binom{n-1}{k}$. For $S_{25}$ ($n=25$):\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: dimension $\\binom{24}{1} = 24$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1^2)$: dimension $\\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1^3)$: dimension $\\binom{24}{3} = 2,024$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 1^4)$: dimension $\\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 1^5)$: dimension $\\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 1^6)$: dimension $\\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 1^7)$: dimension $\\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$.\n    The next partition in this sequence, $(17, 1^8)$, has a dimension of $\\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$, which exceeds the 500,000 threshold. The conjugates of these 7 partitions also have the same dimensions, giving 14 such irreps.\n*   **Partitions with two rows:** For partitions of the form $(n-k, k)$, the dimension of the irrep of $S_n$ is $\\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$. For $S_{25}$ ($n=25$):\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: dimension $\\binom{25}{1} - \\binom{25}{0} = 25 - 1 = 24$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: dimension $\\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: dimension $\\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2,300 - 300 = 2,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 4)$: dimension $\\binom{25}{4} - \\binom{25}{3} = 12,650 - 2,300 = 10,350$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 5)$: dimension $\\binom{25}{5} - \\binom{25}{4} = 53,130 - 12,650 = 40,480$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 6)$: dimension $\\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177,100 - 53,130 = 123,970$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 7)$: dimension $\\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480,700 - 177,100 = 303,600$.\n    The next partition, $(17, 8)$, has a dimension of $\\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875$, exceeding the limit. The conjugate partitions of these 7 partitions also have identical dimensions.\n\nA comprehensive count reveals the following 30 irreducible representations with dimensions less than 500,000:\n*   (25) and its conjugate (1$^{25}$): dimension 1 (2 irreps)\n*   (24,1) and its conjugate (2,1$^{23}$): dimension 24 (2 irreps)\n*   (23,2) and its conjugate (2$^2$,1$^{21}$): dimension 275 (2 irreps)\n*   (23,1$^2$) and its conjugate (3,1$^{22}$): dimension 276 (2 irreps)\n*   (22,3) and its conjugate (2$^3$,1$^{19}$): dimension 2,000 (2 irreps)\n*   (22,1$^3$) and its conjugate (4,1$^{21}$): dimension 2,024 (2 irreps)\n*   (22,2,1) and its conjugate (3,2,1$^{20}$): dimension 2,275 (2 irreps)\n*   (21,4) and its conjugate (2$^4$,1$^{17}$): dimension 10,350 (2 irreps)\n*   (21,1$^4$) and its conjugate (5,1$^{20}$): dimension 10,626 (2 irreps)\n*   (20,5) and its conjugate (2$^5$,1$^{15}$): dimension 40,480 (2 irreps)\n*   (20,1$^5$) and its conjugate (6,1$^{19}$): dimension 42,504 (2 irreps)\n*   (19,6) and its conjugate (2$^6$,1$^{13}$): dimension 123,970 (2 irreps)\n*   (19,1$^6$) and its conjugate (7,1$^{18}$): dimension 134,596 (2 irreps)\n*   (18,7) and its conjugate (2$^7$,1$^{11}$): dimension 303,600 (2 irreps)\n*   (18,1$^7$) and its conjugate (8,1$^{17}$): dimension 346,104 (2 irreps)\n\nAdding these up, we have a total of 30 irreducible representations of $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n<<<30>>>"
