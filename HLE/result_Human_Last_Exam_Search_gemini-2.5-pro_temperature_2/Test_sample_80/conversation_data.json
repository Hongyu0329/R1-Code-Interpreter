    "An standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 squares along its edges. To place the maximum number of bishops on these squares without any attacking each other, they must all be placed on squares of the same color.\n\nBishops only attack other pieces along diagonals, which means a bishop on a light square can never attack a piece on a dark square, and vice-versa. The 28 edge squares are composed of 14 light squares and 14 dark squares.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge of the board is 14, by occupying all squares of a single color.\n\nIf 14 bishops were placed, the number of edge squares lacking bishops would be:\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (placed bishops) = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
