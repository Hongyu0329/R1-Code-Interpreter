    "Based on an analysis of the stable reduction of the given curve, the final value is 1.\n\nThe process of determining the thickness of the double point involves transforming the original equation of the curve into a more suitable model for analyzing its reduction modulo 2.\n\nThe curve is defined by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. To analyze its reduction, we perform a change of variables. Let $x=1/y$. This transforms the equation into $(zy^3)^2 = y^6+2y^3+2y$.\n\nLet $w = zy^3$, which gives the hyperelliptic curve equation $w^2 = y^6+2y^3+2y$. The right-hand side polynomial, $g(y)=y(y^5+2y^2+2)$, has six branch points, which are its roots. One root is 0, and the other five are the roots of the Eisenstein polynomial $P(y) = y^5+2y^2+2$. Let these roots be $\\beta_i$.\n\nWe work over a suitable 2-adic field extension $K$ which is generated by a root of $P(y)$, for instance, $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\beta_1)$. In this field, let $v_K$ be the valuation normalized such that the uniformizer has valuation 1. The valuation $v$ in the question corresponds to $v = v_K / e$, where $e=5$ is the ramification index. It can be shown that the pairwise valuations of the differences of the branch points are all equal: $v_K(\\beta_i - \\beta_j)=1$ for $i \\neq j$, and $v_K(\\beta_i-0)=1$.\n\nIn the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves, the stable model's geometry is determined by the clustering of the branch points. When the valuations of the differences between branch points are uniform like this, it can lead to a configuration where a single value characterizes the \"distance\" between components in the reduced model. This distance corresponds to the thickness of a double point formed in the reduction process. In this case, that characteristic valuation is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
