In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field ϕ, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action. It is given by the integral: `∫ d³x ∫_0^β dτ ϕ(x, τ) [-∂²_τ - ∇² + m²] ϕ(x, τ)`, where `β` is the inverse temperature, `m` is the mass of the field, `∂²_τ` is the second derivative with respect to imaginary time, and `∇²` is the spatial Laplacian.
