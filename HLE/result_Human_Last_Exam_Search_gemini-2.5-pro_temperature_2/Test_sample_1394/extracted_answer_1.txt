The general solution is given implicitly by the relation $y^2-9 = C(x^2-C)$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. The particular solutions found, $y = \pm 3$ (when $C=0$) and $x^2+y^2=9$ (singular solution which is the envelope of the family of solutions), are included in or represented by this general form.
