    "A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice (also known as a Manhattan lattice) is a well-studied sequence in combinatorics.\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(10), has been calculated to be 44,100. This value is part of the integer sequence A001411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nHere are the first few terms of the sequence a(n) for n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   a(10) = 44100\n\nThere is no known simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, and the computation for larger values of n is a significant challenge.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
