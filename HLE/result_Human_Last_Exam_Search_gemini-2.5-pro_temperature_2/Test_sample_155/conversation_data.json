    "The provided LaTeX code snippet using the `verbatim` environment encodes a word visually. The key is to interpret the placement of the letter 't' as a \"pixel\" forming larger letters on a grid, while 'b' and spaces represent the background.\n\nBy mapping the 't' characters onto a grid based on their line and column position, three distinct letter shapes emerge:\n\n1.  **F:** The first letter is a stylized 'F'. Its vertical spine is formed by the 't's at the beginning of lines 1, 5, and 7.\n2.  **L:** The second letter is an 'L'. Its vertical bar is formed by the 't's in the middle of lines 1, 7, and 13, and its horizontal bar is formed by the 't's on line 13.\n3.  **Y:** The third letter is a 'Y'. The arms of the 'Y' are represented by the 't's on lines 1 and 13 towards the right, and its stem is formed by the 't's on lines 10 and 11 at the end of the block.\n\nWhen combined, these letters spell out the word.\n\n<<<FLY>>>"
