    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, analyzed using the epsilon expansion where d = 4 - ϵ, the interaction strength is described by a coupling parameter, often denoted as g, λ, or u. The behavior of this coupling under changes in energy scale is governed by the beta function, β(u). A fixed point, u*, is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, indicating that the coupling no longer changes with scale.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling u in ϕ⁴ theory is given by:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + A * u²\n\nHere, 'A' is a constant whose value depends on the specific normalization chosen for the coupling constant 'u'. Setting the beta function to zero yields the non-trivial fixed point (the other solution being the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u=0).\n\nβ(u*) = -ϵu* + A(u*)² = 0\nA(u*)² = ϵu*\nu* = ϵ / A\n\nDepending on the conventions used for the coupling constant, different values for 'A' are found in the literature. For a Lagrangian with an interaction term of the form (λ/4!)ϕ⁴, a common result for the fixed point is:\nλ* = (8π² / 3)ϵ\n\nIf the coupling `u` is defined such that the beta function is β(u) = -ϵu + (N+8)/6 * u² for an O(N)-symmetric theory, for the single component theory (N=1), the fixed point is:\nu* = (2/3)ϵ.\n\nAnother common normalization gives the beta function as βλ = -ελ + 3λ², which leads to a fixed point at:\nλ* = ϵ / 3.\n\nRegardless of the normalization of the coupling constant, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is directly proportional to ϵ.\n\n<<<u* ∝ ϵ>>>"
