    "John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* explicitly mentions two historical individuals who are regarded as saints by name: **Enoch and Elijah**.\n\nIn Book III of the poem, Milton refers to \"translated Saints,\" individuals who were taken into Heaven without experiencing death. Scholarly sources confirm that this is a direct reference to the Old Testament prophets Enoch and Elijah.\n\nThe story of Enoch is further detailed in Book XI, when the Archangel Michael presents Adam with a vision of the future. Michael describes Enoch as a just man in a world of corruption who, as a reward for his piety, was \"translated\" to Heaven by God.\n\nWhile the biblical figure Noah is also mentioned by name in Book XI as a \"just man\" and \"virtuous,\" he is not described as having been translated or explicitly referred to as a saint in the text.\n\nThe Archangel Michael, a significant figure in the poem, is honored with the title of \"Saint\" in some Christian traditions. However, Milton does not use this title when referring to him in *Paradise Lost*.\n\nTherefore, only Enoch and Elijah are presented as historical figures who achieved a saintly status through their translation to Heaven.\n\n<<<2>>>"
