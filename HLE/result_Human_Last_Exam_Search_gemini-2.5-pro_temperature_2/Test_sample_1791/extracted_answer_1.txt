The effective electron-electron interaction, mediated by a phonon of mode **q** and frequency $w_q$, is given by:
$V_{eff}(q, \omega_n) = - \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m(w_q^2 + \omega_n^2)}$
This interaction couples electron density fluctuations, and its full form in the effective Hamiltonian for a single mode is $V_{eff}(q, \omega_n) \rho_{\mathbf{q}}^\dagger \rho_{\mathbf{q}}$. Here, $\omega_n$ is the Matsubara frequency corresponding to the energy exchanged between the electrons.
