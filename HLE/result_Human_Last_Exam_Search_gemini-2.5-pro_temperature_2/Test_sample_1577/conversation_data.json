    "To determine the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we first need to find the number of logical qubits, `k`, that can be encoded. The ground space degeneracy will then be `2^k`.\n\nThe problem is typically set on a sphere (a surface with genus `g=0`), which has no outer boundary. The holes, or punctures, create boundaries on this surface.\n\n1.  **Types of Boundaries and Anyons:** The toric code has two types of elementary excitations, or anyons: electric charges (`e`) and magnetic fluxes (`m`). The boundaries of the holes are defined by which type of anyon can condense (i.e., be absorbed) at that boundary.\n    *   **Smooth Boundary:** Also known as a `z` boundary or dual boundary. At this boundary, `m`-fluxes condense. Logical `Z` operators, which are strings of Pauli-Z operators, cannot terminate here.\n    *   **Rough Boundary:** Also known as an `x` boundary or primal boundary. At this boundary, `e`-charges condense. Logical `X` operators, which are strings of Pauli-X operators, cannot terminate here.\n\n2.  **Constructing Logical Qubits:** A logical qubit requires a pair of anti-commuting logical operators (`X_L`, `Z_L`).\n    *   A logical `Z_L` operator corresponds to transporting an `e`-charge between two points where it cannot condense. These points must be on smooth boundaries.\n    *   A logical `X_L` operator corresponds to transporting an `m`-flux between two points where it cannot condense. These points must be on rough boundaries.\n\n3.  **Counting Logical Qubits:**\n    *   With `n` smooth holes, we have `n` smooth boundaries. These can be used to define `n-1` independent logical `Z` operators. This requires at least two smooth holes to form a non-trivial operator connecting them (or one hole if an appropriate outer boundary exists). For a system with only these holes on a sphere, we have `max(0, n-1)` such operators.\n    *   Similarly, with `m` rough holes, we have `m` rough boundaries. These can be used to define `m-1` independent logical `X` operators. This gives `max(0, m-1)` operators.\n\n4.  **The Formula:** For a topological code on a surface of genus `g` with `b_s` smooth boundaries and `b_r` rough boundaries, the number of logical qubits `k` is given by the formula:\n    `k = 2g + b_s + b_r - 2`\n    This formula applies when there is at least one boundary of each type (`b_s > 0` and `b_r > 0`).\n\n    In the context of the question, the surface is a sphere, so the genus `g=0`. We have `n` smooth holes, so `b_s = n`. We have `m` rough holes, so `b_r = m`. Substituting these values into the formula (and assuming `n>0, m>0`):\n    `k = 2(0) + n + m - 2`\n    `k = n + m - 2`\n\n    If `n=0` or `m=0`, the formula changes to `k = 2g + b - 1`, where `b` is the number of holes of the single present type. For a sphere, this would be `k=n-1` (if `m=0`) or `k=m-1` (if `n=0`). However, multiple-choice questions in this domain usually refer to the general case where both types of boundaries are present. The formula `k=n+m-2` correctly calculates the number of logical qubits for all `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`.\n\n5.  **Ground Space Degeneracy:** The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is `2^k`.\n    Therefore, GSD = `2^(n+m-2)`.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
