    "A finite group G is a **filled group** if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G fills G. A subset S of a group G is called product-free if for any elements a and b in S (not necessarily distinct), their product ab is not in S. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not properly contained in any other product-free set. The condition that a product-free set S \"fills\" G means that every non-identity element of G can be expressed as an element of S or as a product of two elements from S (i.e., G* = S ∪ SS, where G* is the set of non-identity elements of G and SS = {ab | a, b ∈ S}).\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups has been established, primarily through the work of C.S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S.B. Hart. Their research provides a complete description of these groups.\n\nA fundamental result is that a finite filled nilpotent group must either be a p-group or have an order that is not divisible by the square of any prime. Specifically, a filled nilpotent group must be one of the cyclic groups C₃ or C₅, or it must be a 2-group.\n\nThe classification further details which of these possibilities results in a filled group. The finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the following:\n\n*   **Elementary abelian 2-groups:** These are groups isomorphic to a direct product of copies of the cyclic group of order 2, (C₂)ⁿ for some n ≥ 1.\n*   **The cyclic group of order 3 (C₃).**\n*   **The cyclic group of order 5 (C₅).**\n*   **The dihedral group of order 8 (D₈).**\n*   **The direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2 (D₈ × C₂).**\n*   **The central product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the quaternion group of order 8 (D₈ ∗ Q₈).** This group is one of the two extraspecial 2-groups of order 32.\n*   **The direct product of the central product (D₈ ∗ Q₈) and a cyclic group of order 2 ((D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂).**\n\nTherefore, a finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if it is isomorphic to one of the groups listed above. Notably, the abelian filled groups are the elementary abelian 2-groups, C₃, and C₅, which form a subset of this classification. The remaining groups on the list are the non-abelian filled nilpotent 2-groups.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if it is either an elementary abelian 2-group, one of the cyclic groups C₃ or C₅, or one of the non-abelian 2-groups D₈, D₈ × C₂, D₈ ∗ Q₈, or (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.>>>"
