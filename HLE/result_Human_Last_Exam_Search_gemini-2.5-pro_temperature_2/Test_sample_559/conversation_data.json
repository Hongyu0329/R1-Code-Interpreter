    "Answering the question requires finding the equilibrium points of the system and analyzing their stability. The separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors, and it is typically associated with the stable or unstable manifolds of a saddle point.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting both derivatives to zero.\nFrom $u'(t) = 0$, we have $u^2(u - 1) = 0$, which yields $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + 0 \\cdot d - 0 = 2d^2 = 0$\n    This gives $d = 0$. So, one equilibrium point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3 + 5)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0$\n    This gives $d = 0$ or $d = -1$. So, two other equilibrium points are $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe system has three equilibrium points: $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the nature of these equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system, which describes the linearized system near each point.\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries since the matrix is upper triangular:\n$\\lambda_1 = 4d - 3u + 5u^2$\n$\\lambda_2 = u(3u - 2)$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 = 2$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 1(3(1) - 2) = 1$\n    Since both eigenvalues are positive, the point $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 = -4 - 3 + 5 = -2$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 1(3(1) - 2) = 1$\n    Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, the point $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point. This is key because separatrices are the invariant manifolds of saddle points.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is a special trajectory that separates regions of different behavior. In this case, it will be the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1, 1)$. We look for an explicit equation for this trajectory. The equation for the phase plane trajectories is:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^3(u - 1)}{u^2(u - 1)}$\n\nWe can test if a simple curve of the form $d=f(u)$ is an invariant curve (i.e., a trajectory). Let's test the curve $d = -u^2$.\nThis implies $d(t) = -[u(t)]^2$. Differentiating with respect to $t$:\n$d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot u'(t) = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original equation for $d'(t)$:\n$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n$d'(t) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nThe expressions match, which means $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution curve for the system. We can check that this curve passes through the equilibrium points:\n*   If $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n*   If $u=0$, then $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. The curve passes through the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\nThis curve, $d = -u^2$, connects the saddle point to another equilibrium point and acts as a dividing line in the phase plane. Trajectories on one side of this curve will exhibit different long-term behavior from those on the other side. Specifically, it separates the basin of attraction of the equilibrium at $(0,0)$ from the region of trajectories where $d \\to -\\infty$ as $u \\to 0$. Therefore, this curve is the separatrix.\n\nThe separatrix of the system is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$, or $d + u^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the parabola given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
