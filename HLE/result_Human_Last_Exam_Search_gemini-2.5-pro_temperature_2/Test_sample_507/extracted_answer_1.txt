Based on the extensive research conducted, no two languages from two distinct cultures in Asia with no direct contact could be found where the words for "broom", "mom", and "dad" are all nearly identical or highly similar. While many languages share similar-sounding words for "mom" and "dad" due to common patterns in infant language development, this similarity does not extend to the culturally-specific word for "broom".
