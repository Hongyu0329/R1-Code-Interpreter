    "To find the possible degrees of the normal field extensions $L / \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, where $K$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we must first determine the Galois group of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Factor the Polynomial\n\nThe given polynomial $p(x)$ can be factored by grouping terms:\n$p(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$p(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nLet $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $p(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Galois Group of Each Factor\n\nThe splitting field of $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we analyze its properties to find its Galois group:\n1.  **Irreducibility:** Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$, since 3 divides the coefficients -9 and 3, but $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term -6 (mistake in original thought, it should be +3, and $3^2$ does not divide 3), and 3 does not divide the leading coefficient 1, the polynomial $f_2(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Roots:** To determine the nature of its roots, we examine the derivative $f_2'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The derivative has two real roots, $x = \\pm\\sqrt{9/5}$. By Rolle's theorem, this implies $f_2(x)$ has at most three real roots. We can confirm it has exactly three by evaluating the polynomial at certain points: $f(-2)=-11$, $f(0)=3$, $f(1)=-5$, and $f(2)=17$. An irreducible quintic polynomial with exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots is known to have a Galois group isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_5$. Thus, if $K_2$ is the splitting field of $f_2(x)$, then $\\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Galois Group of the Splitting Field K\n\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum $K_1K_2$. To find the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, we consider the intersection $K_1 \\cap K_2$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $f_2(x)$. The discriminant is $D = 4^4(-9)^5 + 5^5(3)^4 = -14,863,419$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14,863,419})$, the intersection $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWhen the intersection is trivial, the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of this group is $|G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Degrees of Normal Intermediate Fields\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, the normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ that are subfields of $K$ correspond to the normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is equal to the index $[G:H]$ of the corresponding normal subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$. We need to find the indices of all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group), and $S_5$. The normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This leads to the following proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$:\n\n1.  **Products of normal subgroups:**\n    *   $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$, with $|H_1|=60$. The index is $[G:H_1] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$, with $|H_2|=120$. The index is $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, with $|H_3|=2$. The index is $[G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times A_5$, with $|H_4|=120$. The index is $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **\"Diagonal\" normal subgroup:**\n    *   There exists one other normal subgroup, $H_5$, which is a subdirect product. It is related to the quotient $S_5/A_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This subgroup is $H_5 = \\{(g,s) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times S_5 \\mid g=0 \\Leftrightarrow \\text{sign}(s)=1\\}$. The order of this subgroup is also 120, so its index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nCollecting the distinct values for the degrees (the indices of these subgroups), we find the set of all possible degrees for the normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
