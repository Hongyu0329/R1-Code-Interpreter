    "It is not possible to provide a specific number of \"pas de Balanchines\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\" The reason is that a \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a single, definable ballet step that can be counted. Rather, it describes a particular style and aesthetic of movement pioneered by the choreographer George Balanchine, which heavily influenced William Forsythe.\n\nWilliam Forsythe is widely regarded as a choreographer who deconstructed and built upon the neoclassical style of George Balanchine. His own choreographic language in pieces like \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" extends and accelerates traditional ballet figures, often pushing dancers off-balance and exploring the extremes of their physical capabilities. Therefore, the entire solo, and indeed the whole ballet, is imbued with the *spirit* and *principles* of Balanchine's work, reimagined and pushed to new limits.\n\nForsythe's choreography is known for its intricate, high-speed, and athletic movements, which challenge the traditional lines and verticality of classical ballet. This approach is a direct extension of Balanchine's own innovations. As Forsythe himself has noted, his work is deeply rooted in the ballet lexicon, which he then reshapes and reinterprets.\n\nCritics and scholars observe that Forsythe's work features:\n*   **Extreme classicism:** Pushing classical techniques to their physical limits.\n*   **Deconstruction:** Breaking down and reassembling the traditional elements of ballet.\n*   **Musicality and Speed:** Complex and syncopated rhythms, a hallmark of Balanchine's style.\n\nA video of the 2015 Semperoper Ballett performance featuring Svetlana Gileva in the \"Jete Woman solo\" is not publicly available for analysis, as the official link is broken. However, even with video footage, it would be a matter of subjective interpretation to label any specific sequence as a \"pas de Balanchine\" instead of seeing it as part of Forsythe's unique choreographic voice that is in constant dialogue with Balanchine's legacy.\n\nSvetlana Gileva, as a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett, has an extensive repertoire that includes numerous works by both George Balanchine and William Forsythe, indicating her deep familiarity with both styles. The reviews of the Semperoper Ballett's performances of Forsythe's work praise the dancers' ability to embody his demanding and unique style.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of \"how many\" pas de Balanchines were performed is based on a misunderstanding of ballet terminology. The entire Jete Woman solo is a continuous expression of Forsythe's style, which is itself a creative evolution of the Balanchine aesthetic.\n\n<<<It is not possible to quantify the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" steps as it is a stylistic influence rather than a specific, countable move.>>>"
