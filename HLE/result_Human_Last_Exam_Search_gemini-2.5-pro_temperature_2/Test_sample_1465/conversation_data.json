    "An analysis of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences based on established principles of protein engineering and bioinformatics prediction tools allows for the determination of their likely oligomeric states. The primary determinant for the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is the identity of the amino acid residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (a-b-c-d-e-f-g).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis for each sequence, assuming a standard heptad repeat starting from the first residue:\n\n*   **Sequence 1: EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**\n    The amino acids at the 'a' positions are E, I, A, and A, while the 'd' positions are occupied by Q, L, W, and L. The presence of Isoleucine (I) at an 'a' position and Leucine (L) at a 'd' position is a strong indicator of a **dimeric (2)** structure.\n\n*   **Sequence 2: EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**\n    The 'a' positions in this sequence are E, I, A, and A, and the 'd' positions are A, K, E, and A. The prevalence of the small hydrophobic amino acid Alanine (A) at the core positions, along with some polar residues, is characteristic of coiled-coils that form **dimers (2)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 3: EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**\n    This sequence has Isoleucine (I) residues predominantly at the 'a' positions (E, I, I, I) and a mix of residues including Isoleucine at the 'd' positions (A, K, W, I). The historical work by Harbury et al. demonstrated that having Isoleucine at the 'a' positions and Leucine at the 'd' positions leads to a tetrameric structure. The high content of the bulky hydrophobic Isoleucine in the core of this sequence favors a higher-order oligomer, and it is predicted to be a **tetramer (4)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 4: EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**\n    The 'a' positions are E, I, I, and I, and the 'd' positions are K, Q, W, and Q. While the Isoleucine at the 'a' positions might suggest a higher-order structure, the presence of polar Lysine (K) and Glutamine (Q) residues at the core 'd' positions can be destabilizing for larger oligomers. The interplay of these residues, along with potential charge interactions from residues at the 'e' and 'g' positions, suggests a preference for a **dimeric (2)** state.\n\n*   **Sequence 5: EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**\n    Here, the 'a' positions are E, I, A, and A, and the 'd' positions are Q, T, W, and T. The presence of the polar amino acid Threonine (T) at the 'd' positions is a significant feature. Studies have shown that the incorporation of polar residues at the 'd' position of the heptad repeat often promotes the formation of **trimers (3)**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the predicted oligomeric states for the five sequences are 2, 2, 4, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\n<<<D>>>"
