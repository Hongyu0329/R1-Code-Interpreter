    "The first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was the 1951 film *An American in Paris*.\n\nThe film features a ballet sequence set in a stylized version of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where one of the Luxor Obelisks is located. The film won a total of six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n\nEarly Best Picture winners such as *Cavalcade* (1933), set in London, and *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), set in Paris, were investigated as potential candidates but do not feature a Luxor Obelisk. While *Cavalcade* has London as a narrative location, there is no evidence it depicts Cleopatra's Needle. *The Life of Emile Zola* is set in Paris and even had sets constructed to represent parts of the city, but again, there is no indication the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk were shown.\n\nOther potential films that were considered included *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), which does feature scenes in Paris, and *Cleopatra* (1963), which had some filming in Egypt. However, *An American in Paris* predates these films.\n\n<<<An American in Paris (1951)>>>"
