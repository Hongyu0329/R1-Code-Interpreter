    "There are exactly **14** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for any elements *a*, *b* in *S* (not necessarily distinct), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the group *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their work, detailed in the paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\", provides a complete list of these groups. The term \"sum-free\" is used in the context of abelian groups, but the paper addresses general finite groups, where \"product-free\" is the more common term.\n\nThe finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:**\n    *   C₅ (Cyclic group of order 5)\n    *   C₆ (Cyclic group of order 6)\n    *   C₈ (Cyclic group of order 8)\n    *   C₁₀ (Cyclic group of order 10)\n    *   C₁₂ (Cyclic group of order 12)\n\n*   **Dihedral Groups:**\n    *   D₆ (Dihedral group of order 6, also known as the symmetric group S₃)\n    *   D₈ (Dihedral group of order 8)\n    *   D₁₂ (Dihedral group of order 12)\n\n*   **Quaternion and Dicyclic Groups:**\n    *   Q₈ (Quaternion group of order 8)\n    *   Q₁₂ (Dicyclic group of order 12)\n\n*   **Other Abelian Groups:**\n    *   C₂ × C₂ (the Klein-four group)\n    *   C₄ × C₂ (the direct product of cyclic groups of order 4 and 2)\n\n*   **Other Non-Abelian Groups:**\n    *   A₄ (the Alternating group on 4 elements)\n    *   SL(2,3) (the special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field of 3 elements, of order 24)\n\nIn total, these are 14 distinct isomorphism classes of finite groups.\n\n<<<14>>>"
